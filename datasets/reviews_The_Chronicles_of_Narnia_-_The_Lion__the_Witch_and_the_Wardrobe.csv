0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A155X6KYOPQEZ5	"#1 Cardinal Fan ""Afe"""	Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent to live with the professor in a mansion. When they're playing hide and seek, they discover a world that they never thought existed. Here we enter Narnia-where mythical creatures talk and where a cruel white witch reigns over the land. She has a spell to keep it always winter-but never Christmas. No one can defeat the white witch. Except-there is a prophecy- that if 2 sons of Adam and 2 daughters of Eve sit at the throne at Cair Paravel, the white witch will be defeated. Can it be done? The only hope Narnia has is for the four children to sit at the throne. Led by Aslan-the creator of the land-who will come out victorious?I really enjoyed watching this movie. Not only is it full of great special effects and plenty of action, but it's filled with lots of symbolism. The books are written by C.S Lewis-a Christian author. In his books Lewis put in tons and tons of symbolism. And the movie follows it.Now for the effects. This movie is chalkfull of effects. The Lion-Aslan actually looks real compared to the earlier Narnia movies. The battle sequence is great. The scenery is great, too. (it was filmed in New Zealand) So if you like action and adventure, and have read the books-then step into Narnia-where everything comes to life!	5.0	Outstanding movie!	2008-06-18	1	0	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"""The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" presents the C.S. Lewis fantasy classic very well.  (The story takes place during World War II in England where Lucy, the youngest of four siblings [Peter, Edmund, and Susan] stumbles upon a magical kingdom named Narnia in the back of a wardrobe of a professor's mansion while playing hide-and-go-seek.)  The children find themselves in a world of animals, fauns, and other mythical beasts who are captive to a witch's spell casting a perennial winter upon Narnia.  They find themselves in an adventure to help free Narnia from the icy grip of the White Witch, Jadis, and her endless winter. (It is a fantasy much like ""The Lord of the Rings"" with Christian allegory, but with enough appeal to please a wider audience.)Fortunately, the technical development for the movie lives up to our expectations. Many comparisons have been made to Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but, while ""Narnia"" owes a great deal to the former's technical excellence (mainly from director Andrew Adamson's experience with ""Shrek""), ""Narnia"" stands on its own.  Luckily for C.S. Lewis fans, the making of this movie is very timely.  The acting, which has sometimes been undermined, is good all around.  While Tilda Swinton is aptly given praise for her role as Jadis, the White Witch, the child actors deserve accolades for their natural portrayals as the young sojourners to the Narnia world.  (Their emotional range from sibling rivalry to genuine astonishment is good throughout.) The movie is also true to the book in content and  meaning without being watered down.  It presents an absorbing story and a gripping adventure.The movie is rated PG, but it shouldn't scare away too many viewers.  There are some frightening moments, and, indeed, the violence, while not too graphic, will be at least a notch up from cowboy and Indian matinee movies from the fifties. (Some five-year-old viewers survived the jolts at the movie theatre better than this reviewer, and the reader can always control the volume at home.) This movie is great entertainment for people of all ages."	5.0	Cinematic Splendour	2006-04-09	7	4	3

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A35R8PJSEURHHF	Aaron Merkel	When I was just a little kid I fell in love with the cartoon version of this story.  The movie followed the cartoon version very closely and it was amazing to see it brought to life.  I was teary eyed through most of the movie, it really moved me. Some of the mystical creatures gave me a chuckle because they looked silly and it almost seemed like watching Xena...but i thought the scenery and especially the music was wonderful.  You really get wrapped up in it and I think I liked the beautiful white snow instead of the lush green.  So, anyway, if you did watch the cartoon version you won't be disappointed.	5.0	Relive the childhood memory.	2005-12-20	4	2	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2EEUQ81DTY7G3	A Customer	At the Library where I work, we can't keep the Chronicles of Narnia series on the shelf fast enough. A perennial favourite with the kids, the books have certainly proved the test of time and become much loved. The film of the first book in the series is certainly worth looking at, and unlike the Harry Potter novels, you don't have to be an aficionado of the books to understand the story.Not having read the books though, I can still appreciate that the film remains faithful to the book in tone and imagery, and it's solid, reasonably close cinematic approximation of C.S. Lewis's books, even if the film is a little overlong and a trifle dull in spots.  It's a lovingly rendered sword and sorcery epic that just needed a trimming in a few spots, yet it is appealing, mostly because the startling visual effects don't overwhelm the impact of the actual story.Narnia is indeed a magical, surreal world into which four lovely children stumble. Animals talk, centaurs and satyrs romp, a magnificent, all-powerful lion named Aslan pads through dispensing deeper meaning, and then there's an absolute tour-de-force performance by Tilda Swinton as the machiavellian, Jadis, the White Witch, who will stop at nothing to keep her icy empire intact.Peter the eldest (William Moseley), Susan the priss (Anna Popplewell), Edmund the sour (Skandar Keynes), and the cute Lucy  (Georgie Henley) are packed off by their mother to the country to escape the London blitz. They are to stay with a distant relative (Jim Broadbent, eccentrically bewigged). One rainy Sunday afternoon Lucy idly wanders into that wardrobe and stumbles into the snow where she meets Tumnus (James McAvoy), a faun.Edmund follows a short time later, where he bumps into Jadis and is immediately seduced by her promise of endless hot chocolates and Turkish delights. All the children eventually make it over and are beguiled by this world where beavers talk and where they are forced to come to terms with the fact that they are the four humans who will free the realm from Jadis's icy grip.Admittedly some of the CGI effects don't quite work - particularly in the middle section - and there could have been more thought put into some of the smaller details, like having Mr. Tumnus's ears move for instance. But the marvelous Ms. Swinton as the wicked White Queen, more than makes up for its shortcomings. A woman of formidable talents, she totally embodies the attributes of an obsessed fanatic with a cold interest in cruelty.Much has been made about the religious and mythological aspects of the story and the conflict between civilization and chaos. I didn't get much of that here. If there were any references to Christian martyrdom in the books, they have certainly been glossed over in the film. Most of what you see on screen, while paying lip service to moral ideas, is pretty much about war and chaos, the film opening with devastating scenes of the blitz, and then ending with the ultimate battle for the control of Narnia.As the children gain ground against the witch, Narnia begins to thaw, and they become ever more confident and determined to save the realm - Peter gets a sword, Susan gets a bow and arrow, a dagger for Lucy. And the scary battle scene at the end is as good as any that you will see in the Lord of the Rings. It almost becomes medieval, with the Peter as a Teutonic-like soldier, and war as the only way to make the world a safer place. Mike Leonard April 06.	4.0	"""It is finished,"""	2006-04-09	4	1	3
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1VQBHHXIKHIGS	A Customer	First, some background. When I was a child, I avoided almost anything written for or marketed to children, for fear, usually justified, of Disneyfication. Anything with a list of three items in the title is particularly to be avoided, unless it's called THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY.If memory serves, there was an animated Disney version of this back then. And in fact, the current incarnation comes to us from Disney. Thus, I came to this film with extremely low expectations.I was wrong. I was wrong wrong WRONG. A compelling story told well, and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. This is why CGI was invented. It'll never be put to better use. Never.I've read a lot of criticisms lately claiming that C.S. Lewis was guilty of flagrant Christian symbolism. I don't see it here. What I see are features that are common to all or most mythologies, which is what the academic C.S. Lewis studied during his lifetime.Also, a big tip of the hat to whoever wrote the screenplay. I don't know how much is C.S. Lewis and how much is screenwriting, but for me this story never flagged because clever dialogue, delivered perfectly straight, had me giggling through what could have otherwise been boring walks through the scenery. Gorgeous scenery too, both in Narnia and back on good old Earth.	4.0	Narnia	2006-08-28	2	2	0

I have also read the books and felt like nothing important was left out. I highly recommend this movie to anyone seeking to have a good time watching a family-friendly flick. The four kids chosen to be main characters are very cute and their acting is good.There are three versions of the film to be aware of: one has just the movie, one has the movie and a special features DVD, and one has the movie and three discs of DVD features.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1V9WDK7OUTMG6	"A. Dilkes ""Aquarium Lady"""	I have loved the Narnia series of stories all of my life. I have several different editions of the books, a cassette set of the dramatised BBC version (very well done) and the recently released audiobooks read by well known actors (Kenneth Branaugh's Magician's Nephew is a delight). I was very excited when it was announced that films were being made and looked forward to this one with just as much anticipation as the LOTR trilogy. Understand that it's a beautifully done film, visually gorgeous and the casting is spot on (I agree with everyone else, Lucy is perfect), BUT... For those like me who love the stories and the spirit in which they are told will not like this movie as much as some. The books tried to display and encourange the best qualities that are within all of us. Forget about the christian themes for a moment if you will, I mean good old character traits like courage, honesty, loyalty. For some reason the filmakers decided to infuse the characters with far too much frailty (the kids squabble needlessly, the beavers argue and insult each other, Edmund is now given a father at war as a justification for his treacherous behavior, Peter is quite wimpy at times, the list goes on). I also wondered as some others here did why Aslan is regular lion-size, though Liam Neeson's voice is wonderful. What I'm trying to say (and sorry to be so long-winded) is that this movie is well worth seeing for lovers of fantasy and Narnia, but while Peter Jackson made some changes with LOTR but still remained true to the stories most basic elements, this director did not. Maybe they'll do better with Prince Caspian. I'll be there on opening day to find out:).	4.0	Quite good, BUT......	2006-03-28	3	2	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AWUDZO41NCJQ	A. Garrett	"I must be honest. When I first heard they were making a movie based on The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe,and that the director was the guy who did Shrek, I was horrified. The Narnia books have been my favorites since childhood, and if they were going to do a movie of them, I wanted it done right. Considering the fact that C.S. Lewis was a Christian, and that Christian themes abound in the Narnian books, I couldn't see how the director of Shrek(an immoral, irreverent, sorry excuse for a kids movie) could do Narnia justice.  I was both confirmed in my apprehenions and pleasently surprised.I saw Narnia on the day it came out, and left the theatre grappling with my true opinion. My family loved it, and so did everybody else I knew that saw it, but I just couldn't get past a few major liberties the film makers took. For instance, almost none of the original dialogue from Lewis' book was kept in. They rewrote the whole thing. Lewis was a genius, and I'm sure he said what he meant and he meant what he said when writing his Narnia books. There was no reason to change it.Also, the added baggage of the children fighting amongst themselves- Susan griping the whole time about wanting to go home, and even Peter wimping out at times. In the book, Susan voted for going home once at the beginning, and that's all that was said on the subject.There were other instances of leaving out entire scenes, and subtly changing the meanings behind things. For example, when the children meet Father Christmas, in the book he told them that the witch's magic was weakening and that ""Aslan is on the move"". In  the film he said ""the hope you have brought...is beginning to weaken her power..."" That was rather blatantly leaving out what I thought was an important part of who Aslan's character is supposed to be. No one else noticed it. Speaking of which, Aslan came off as less than he should have been. In the book he is described as a ""Great Lion""-i.e. taller than ordinary lions. He was shorter than the children on the film, and it seemed all wrong him having to look up at them when he spoke.These may seem trivial errors to anyone who hasn't read or loved the books. But I just didn't see any reason to change things the way they did.On to what pulled the film up by the bootstraps: It was undeniably well-made as far as acting, costumes, sets, and special effects.  Aslan(except for being too short) was beautifully animated and Liam Neeson's voice really brought him to life. The White Witch gave a chilling performance, embodying her deadly beauty and ruthless cruelty. All the children were very well cast. I know everyone says this, but it's true-Georgie Henley was the most memorable. Her Lucy was one of the major redeeming qualities for me, as the spirit of her character came across as it should have. Edmund was good in this respect as well, he was perfectly nasty and spiteful, just as he should have been. Peter was a likeable big brother character, and Susan was a good nagging whiner through most of the movie, which was a little overdone compared to the book. Lewis himself called her a ""wet blanket"" in later books, but that description wasn't really applicable to this book.The battle scene at the end was excellent. Lewis didn't really go into any description of the battle in the book, since the characters show up at the end of it, but I was secretly hoping they would show more in the movie, and they did.Overall, I think the movie, just for the movie's sake, was good and worth watching. However, it would be a crime for someone to see it and not ever read the book. It is by no means a replacememt for the real story. There's no comparison."	3.0	First of all, have you read the book?	2006-03-25	20	10	10

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A10NM7G7ZJKFFK	"Amazon Customer ""dana"""	Four English children venture through a wardrobe into a world of wonder, magic and a magnificent Lion named Aslan.I've been waiting for more than 20 years for this very day; the day when I would meet Him; perhaps not face to face, but in a form that meets the expectations of my secret heart.And he did not disappoint. Aslan is every inch the king. He is amazingly real; one has the sense that were you to reach out you could touch him, if he would only allow it.For you see, it was for Aslan that I waited, it was Aslan whom I yearned to meet. I wanted to see him, and if not to touch him, to at least to hear his voice.But sadly, it was not Aslan's voice I heard.I heard Rob Roy!It is not Aslan's fault that I kept picturing Liam Neeson when the savior of Narnia spoke; that blame lay solely with Andrew Adamson for choosing poorly. Aslan would have been better served had his voice belonged to him alone; someone of Aslan's personage deserves his own identity. He is, after all, supreme creator. He is, remember, not a tame lion.But the identity crisis aside, LWW was all I could have hoped for. Tilda Swinton deserves an Oscar nod for her portrayal of Jadis; her performance is so strong it nearly steals the movie. She IS the White Witch; cool, cunning, calculating and the very personification of evil disguised as beauty.  Her screen presence is undeniably regal; one cannot ignore her. One cannot resist her.And one is struck, almost eerily, by the uncanny resemblance of the four young actors to the Pevensie children. They were not merely playing the characters of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy; they became the very children of Lewis' creation. Their performance is flawless and heartbreakingly real; Lucy's wide-eyed wonder is as touching as Peter's marvelous Sir Gawaine-like courage in the face of danger. And Edmund and Susan do not disappoint in their respective roles; they play their parts without a single glitch.The details are there as well; things that only a true Narnia fan would notice and proof that Adamson took care with his subject. And though the scene at the Stone Table felt a little rushed, it was handled with the utmost respect and and loving attention to the little things.One last nod to the portrayal of the animals; Ma and Pa Beaver in particular. They were everything I could have hoped for, and Adamson more than did justice to the talking creatures of Narnia, who are every bit human in their voice and attitudes. Had he hit every other point and missed that one, the whole movie would have been wasted. Narnia is, after all, a land of talking animals!Aslan is on the move!PS: Unless you had read the books as a child, and are as big a Narnia freak as I am, I doubt Neeson's portrayal of Aslan will much bother you. It only bothers me because whenever I hear Aslan speak in my head, it's NOT Liam Neeson, who nonetheless does a fantastic job.	5.0	Aslan is on the move!	2006-01-20	5	3	2

I notice that, not surprisingly, most of those giving the movie three to one stars all follow the same billing--that is, Christianphobic in nature and attitude...afraid of any film that might, surprise surprise, give a thumbs up toward the Christian values that have been so important for so many people throughout so many years.

Because these are the same people who moan and groan and whine that Christians are not openminded--and yet they themselves are not openminded to letting Christians have their say.Now for the movie itself, the movie is a grand tale based upon a wonderful series of books written by C. S. Lewis, the same fine writer of Mere Christianity and the Space Trilogy.  The movie holds true to the imagery that Lewis held in his books, that is, a Judeo-Christian series of novels based upon Biblical foundations that are built on solid ground.  While there is much violence and action and adventure in the movie, and thus should be warned to parents who might want to bring very young (younger than 10 y.o.) children, still, there are important lessons that can be found within this movie and hopefully the sequels to the movie.  I hope and pray that this movie and the follow up movies will provoke and bring families together around the Bible, so that what is shown in fiction will be understood as eternal truths (which the Bible is, the truth, the eternal truth, of God through Jesus Christ).	5.0	Interesting Reviews	2005-12-14	11	7	4

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3J683R14PYMWV	Amazon Customer	"I read these books as a small girl and loved them; and, I am currently reading them to my 7 y/o daughter.  Reading them now, I appreciate them from a child's view, and especially love that a chapter book has captivated my child.  However, I did find some points rather disappointing.  As a book, this series falls significantly shortly of JRR Tolkein's books but seemed to try and mirror a lot of his epic tale.  The story leaves holes that Tolkein did not and because of that I couldn't give it 5 stars, and I grudgingly gave it 4 (3.5 is better suited).  The movie itself is the same as the book.  It leaves a lot to be questioned, it does not encompass a fantasy as it should and the young actors were not properly directed throughout.To elaborate on the last point, I felt the Narnia world leaves a lot to be imagined.  It does not go into the depths that I feel any science fiction should.  The community is minimal, the land is not as fascinating as it could, and should, have been.  The child actors, while young, were often corny (for lack of a better term).  Even my daughter laughed at Lucy's expressions, or Susan's and Lucy's absence from the ""war"".  For me, I realize that at the time of the books women were not strong and self-sustaining as characters, but allowing Edmund, Susan's much younger brother (and Lucy's elder by only a year), to participate in the war while Susan laid with a corpse for hours on end was awkward.  The children altogether didn't develop as characters should, and when they did reach those coming of age moments, they were lacking in detail and logic.Despite that, I was happy to realize that, similar to the Golden Compass movie, the religious undertones are not blatant to a child unless someone pointed them out as such.To anyone hoping to feel the awe that was created by Tolkein, and again illustrated in the LOTR movies, Narnia will fall short, in both book and movie.  Nonetheless, it is timeless and something that can be appreciated.  My daughter has loved LOTR and Narnia movies; however, she isn't able to read Tolkein or Pullman yet so I won't compare in that sense."	4.0	Book and Movie Review	2011-09-03	1	1	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	ASB7N755S4EVJ	Amazon Customer	This movie will have pride of place next to my Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Having read the books as a child and recently bought the box set, I was disapointed that they released the 2nd book before the 1st ( but that was a minor irritant).  GO SEE THE MOVIE.  YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED!  Everyone was just fixated by the movie.  Of course it was a little slow to begin, but when Lucy discovers Narnia the excitement begins.  The battle scenes were good (almost but not quite a LOTR copy) and the entire theatre applauded when Aslan showed up in the middle of the battle with the extra troops.  The end of the movie was great too, with the adult versions of the child actors very convincing.  I hope they continue to make the other books into movies.  My personal favourite is the horse and his boy, so I have something to look forward to.  Go see the movie.  Buy the DVD when it's released.  You won't regret it.	5.0	Incredible!

I am sure most of them will highlight the highlights and lowlights.  However, if you are a Christian parent or Granparent heed this advice . . .Chronicles of Narnia is a classic of Christian children's literature.  Read the book aloud to your children.  You can read a chapter a night and get through it in two weeks.  The kids will love the story.  THEN . . . take them to the film. . . . THEN use it as a teaching tool.  They are never too young to learn about their faith.  THEN . . . read the rest of the books in the series . . . THEN wait for the rest of the films.  What a gift!  A series for children that can be used as a teaching tool.For Christian Grandparents . . . Buy the video as soon as it is released.  Though it is not without flaws, it is the best rendering of this classic to date.	5.0	DON'T MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY!	2005-12-10	15	9	6
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1VHK9A4VLJTHC	"Amazon Customer ""Michael S. Beverly"""	"Greatly anticipated I was not disappointed with this adaptation of C.S. Lewis' great book and hope the series can continue to deliver a wonderful story with today's nearly miraculous technology.  CGI has come a long way in a few short years and the lion Aslan in this movie nearly looks life like.  The battle scenes, incorporating thousands of creatures, are amazingly well done.What gives this movie a slightly less than stellar rating, at least for me, is the fact that the characters just aren't developed enough to really capture the heart of the viewer.  Not that the acting isn't very well done, it's just that, well for one thing, it's hard to really make a CGI character truly real, no matter how well done the voice overs are, the nearly life like is just that, nearly.  I suppose there just wasn't time to really develop five protagonists in a two hour movie, and that isn't really the fault of anyone or anything, it just is.  In reading the book the person reading it can take certain parts of it and make it real in the imagination.  The reader can identify with a certain character and take on the fantasy, such is the nature of reading good fiction, but in  movie making, this just isn't possible.Of course comparisons to the Lord of the Rings trilogy will abound, and I will make mine here, I thought this just fell short.  Perhaps the mere fact that the lead characters were children makes this the case, perhaps the nature of the evil to be overcome being better presented in LTR makes it so.  I will make one observation, in the LWW the evil forces don't quite present the same overwhelming odds that they seemed to in LTR, so perhaps this made the tension a bit less.I've seen this at the theaters twice already, once with a large group and once again including a few kids and my four year old.  In the large group, the movie was mostly considered good, with one person really enjoying it a lot, she being someone that hadn't read the book.  The next night my teenaged nephew gave it high praises.  The ten year olds I was with were a bit scared, however they liked the movie.  The tell tale sign I got, however, was from my four year old.  That age tends to see things we adults are able to ignore, that being slow spots while story and back story are being developed.  She asked a couple of times during the show if it was time to go yet, however, when it was all said and done, she gives the movie a big thumbs up and declares the White Witch her favorite character.  She, for some unknown reason, also loves Darth Vader, so who knows, perhaps it's parenting.This leads the the question of appropriateness, and I felt it was fine for young kids, although of course, it does have some scary scenes and scary characters, the ten year olds were scared a few times and my four year old hid her eyes on a few occasions, however, they didn't include any gore or blood, all battle deaths were of the clean implied type, this certainly wasn't Braveheart of anything of that nature, thus the pg as opposed to pg 13 rating.  With no language or any sexual or adult type themes, this movies only reason for being pg is the violence and scariness factors.  For kids not used to this kind of drama, this movie will probably be a bit scary, even too scary, but for those that watch LTR or similar, this one is a bit tamer.All in all I think this is a great family movie.  In spite of what some may claim, C.S. Lewis wrote Aslan as Jesus, there is no getting around that without disregarding Lewis' own words, it was the reason he included the idea of Christmas finally coming when Aslan was ""on the move"" and he said as much in a letter he wrote decades ago to an American girl that wrote to him in England to ask him about the nature of Aslan.  Only those that are ignorant or intentionally being misleading would claim that this story is not a Christology and that the whole series was not written to convey many Christian themes and ideals.  In any case, whether or not one is a Christian or chooses to look for Christian symbolism in the film, it is a good and entertaining movie, a great family movie, a movie worth seeing more than once and undoubtedly will be one worth buying when it comes out on dvd."	4.0	Wonderful film	2005-12-11	7	5	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3SEDVZYQGTRVL	"Amazon Customer ""omnivorous reader"""	In C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, you have to believe that Aslan is as real as a literary lion can be in order to suspend belief. I think that is why he waits until so late in the book The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe to let you know that Aslan is 'the' Lion of the title. When the TV version of the book was released in 1988, the Lion just didn't make the grade and the believability of the story suffered for it. Of course it also didn't help that the child playing Lucy had a voice that just seemed, well whiney.So, when I first heard of this remake I had mixed feelings. I knew that special effects were now up to doing wonderfully real creatures. Then I saw the previews and knew I had to see this film. Well, it was all I hoped for. The children are natural and a good fit for the characters in the books. Aslan was a regal and larger than life lion. And best of all the story was told with an honest effort to stick to the book.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3E81751S55308	"Amazon Customer ""onebigswede"""	"On Friday night my wife and I made it to a showing of the new film, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"". I grew up reading The Chronicles of Narnia, and because of that I've been anticipating the release of this movie for quite some time. Judging upon the movie's first weekend numbers ($67.1 million), there were a good number of others out there like me who couldn't wait to get a peek into the fanciful world that C.S. Lewis created for us in his series of books.======[possible spoilers below]=======The movie opens with a scene of terror as Nazi bombers rain down fire and destruction on the city of London. The Pevensie children and their mother huddle in the relative safety of their bomb shelter as the explosions pierce the night air. The mother realizing that the children won't be safe in the city, sends them away to live at an estate in the English countryside, where their adventures quickly ensue.This beginning to the movie, although I don't think it was in the book, is helpful movie shorthand for laying the groundwork for the relationships between the siblings, and what roles they're going to play in the movie. Edmund begins to shows his rebellious and careless ways, and Peter shows up as the caring, albeit domineering older brother. Susan comes in as the questioning doubting pessimist and Lucy as the carefree believing child.Once at the estate the story begins quickly with Lucy entering the wardrobe and discovering Narnia for the first time. I have to say that the performance of the actor portraying Lucy (Georgie Henley) was for me one of the highlights of this film. She was very believable and engaging, the kind of child that you just love and want to pick up and squeeze. Throughout the movie, she kept making me smile - and you could just tell that she really is a child full of joy and wonderment. In some respects she stole the whole movie - upstaging the performances of the other actors to some degree.After the rest of the children enter the world of Narnia the movie begins revealing some of the wonderful talking creatures including Mr. Tumnus, the beavers, the wolves and their secret police force and many others. Most of them came off wonderfully - with my personal favorites being the beavers. They seemed very believable to me. Aslan was also especially good, sometimes i almost forgot that it wasn't a real lion talking and interacting with the other characters. Some of the other characters, however, to me felt a little to ""CG-ish"". There were times that you could really tell that there was computer animation at work, and it was a bit distracting at times. For example in several scenes I noticed that animals didn't seem to blend in with their surroundings very well (shadowing not quite right), or that they didn't seem to follow the laws of physics quite how they should. Some seemed almost like they were wire models.For the most part I thought the visual scenery was very stunning, from the snow covered forests and mountains, to Aslan's camp in the hills. The Beavers home was also just how I'd imagined it from the book. The only setting in the movie that I didn't really like was the witches castle. In my mind I had always imagined it as this huge forboding place with acres upon acre of frozen stone Narnians, and vast cold halls and filled with evil creatures of every stripe. In the movie I almost felt like the witches lair was cramped, that it didn't really speak to how evil and powerful she was.The plot of the movie follows the book very closely, with the elements of sin, redemption, salvation and sacrifice playing a prominent role. Some of the strongest scenes for me were the ones in which Aslan offers himself up as a sacrifice in place of Edmund. Aslan leaves the camp in the wee hours of the night, and walks with Lucy and Susan as he makes his way to the stone table. The scene gave me chills, and really drove home the anguish that Aslan was in. Also the sacrifice scene really drove home how there is a battle between good and evil, and that sometimes things can seem very dark indeed. Maybe a good lesson for the times that we're in - even though things may look grim, there is the hope that comes with the morning.The one other thing I didn't like about the movie was how the children's characters just picked up their weapons before battle and instantly became experts in their use, despite the fact that they were fighting obviously more experienced fighters on the other side. On this note you have to suspend your disbelief in favor of following the storyline.All in all I thought the movie was very good. The strong points were the plot, characters, strong moral message and beautiful and stunning locations. For me the strong points were VERY strong. Weak points for me included some of the CG work, a couple of the locations and a few situations that asked you to suspend your disbelief. On a scale of 1-5 stars, I give ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" 4 stars."	4.0	Entertaining Movie with a good lesson	2005-12-12	3	2	1

Since then I kept up with the BBC productions and have read all the books.  The movie was outstanding, and can easily compare with a wide variety of other fantasy movies.  My only concern with this movie is that it should have had a sort of prologue or recap on Jadis' and Narnia's origins (from the book The Magician's Nephew).  Even though a recap was not included in the actual book (none was needed because it was well understood when we read the entire series) it would have helped explain some of the questions people who are new to the story might have had.

One of my all time favorite series was given justice in not just the adaptation, but now in this beautiful high def transfer.Everyone knows the story, and by now, anyone who wanted to see the film already has.  The question before us, is it worth getting this Blu-ray version?  The short answer is, hell yeah.The long answer is the reasons why.  First and foremost is the clear and pristine transfer.  For this type of fantasy film, where the colors are somewhat exaggerated and need to pop, the HD transfer helps make this film into a more memorable experience.  The detail is there, just like you would expect from an HD transfer, and the blacks are rich and distinct enough so that there is no crush.The special features are plenty - although I haven't done a comparisson as to how many there are versus the 2 disc DVD edition, from a quick glance, it has plenty to keep those who love special features satisfied.Lovely film, lovely transfer.  That's all a movie lover can ask for.  Buy this, and make sure Disney keeps bringing great films to blu-ray.	5.0	The best adaptation of this timeless classic	2008-06-24	2	1	1

And once the children have entered Narnia, some might be reminded of the Lord of the Rings because of the beautiful scenery and the amazing music that just entraps you and keeps you fearing for the children while the wolves attack, crying during the sacrifice (which can be slightly creepy), and sharing in the victory. Of course, it is slightly changed from the book version, but what movie isn't?

Parts of the battle were poorly done as well.But all negativity aside this is a remarkable movie. After seeing it I ran out and got my hands on the books... and had them read in less than a week.

Unlike LOTR I, II & III you won't get much scenic views of the country. I loved this movie because after a long time a hollywood movie has showed my favorite game cricket. If the children didn't play cricket then the red duce ball wouldn't have broken the window glass and they would have never tried to hide themselves inside the wardrobe.

I want to be able to watch them when she's around, you know?Well, when I saw The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, I was silently cheering in my head because this is a movie that my sister can watch! I've seen some people say it's just a watered down version of The Lord of the Rings (see below reviews), and that might be true to some people, but is it necessarily a bad thing? I mean, you gotta admit, The Lord of the Rings isn't really a kid-friendly movie, you know what I mean? But the all-around messege is! Does that really make sense? To have a movie about friendship that kids can't see?The Chronicles of Narnia is all about families and being loyal to yourself and your siblings and all that, and it's a movie that kids can actually see! I don't know about some people, but I really felt a connection with the oldest sibling, Peter, because it's obvious that he really feels a strong obligation to protect his brother and sisters, and he really loves them, and that's the same way I am with my sister, even though we may fight sometimes!Any parents out there who have kids that argue, fight, etc, I would recommend this movie to. Your kids will probably feel a connection too, though they might not admit it!You might want to rent it before you buy it to make sure you really like it, because even though I thought it was a winner, you can never be completely positive.Heads Up: There is one part in the end of the movie that some littler kids might think is scary. One of the main characters is thought to have died, and that's kind of a sad part.Otherwise, wow! A real accomplishment!	5.0	this should be given many awards	2006-05-29	3	2	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2MLA4FHL5K325	Anna Otto	"I must say, this movie had reminded me of why I fell in love with this book when I was 10, I suppose for the same reason why anyone falls in love with The Chronicles of Narnia. The movie captured the magic of falling through the wardrobe into the frozen forest, of Lucy finding the streetlamp and of meeting the fawn, and even of turkish delight conjured by the White Witch. To me, the saddest part had always seemed to be the fact that the four children who become kings and queens of Narnia eventually go back. This final sequence had also been perfectly captured, and was just as wistful as I remember the book being.As to the acting, it was truly fantastic. Several times during the movie, I found myself smiling at the expressions on Georgie Henley's face: she is such a wonderful little actress. I will be watching out for her. And, by God, Tilda Swinton makes a perfect Satanic figure (let's call things by their proper names, i.e. this is after all a book written by C.S. Lewis after he had embraced religion...). By her own words, she is playing the ultimate ""white Nazi supremacist,"" and each icy words that drops from her thin lips is an exercise in cruelty and coldness that personify absolute evil.Though there are small deviations from the book, overall it's a gorgeous and moving adaptation. Truly, I couldn't find too many faults with it, and people of different beliefs and religious/anti-religious convictions will be able to identify with the story. Everyone understands Good against Evil, after all.My one gripe about the movie had been that it's a bit too clean. I mean, the filmmakers clearly intended to create a safe and perfectly acceptable Disney movie for the masses. That's fine. As an adult, however, I was unsatisfied by this exercise in PG censorship. Don't you worry, this movie isn't nearly violent enough. Even Aslan, killed and resurrected, springs to life with barely a drop of blood spilt.In other words, it's perfect for children and nearly perfect for adults who want to see one of their beloved books come to life..."	4.0	They do capture the essense of Narnia	2005-12-27	2	1	1

The acting of the children was wonderful!  Lucy particularly stole the show!I also enjoyed the special effects of the movie.  I love how the graphics really just added to it, rather then the movie being all about the special effects.  For example, when we meet Tumnus his legs seem so natural that we can focus on him as a character.  And little details like him stomping his feet when he comes inside from the snow are priceless!Aslan, and the whole battle sequences looked fantastic!  The Gryphon was breathtaking.  Unfortunately I felt the fox, and in some parts the wolves did not hold up to the same standards.

Very happy.  I liked the movie a lot and was glad when the actress for Lucy turned out to NOT be annoying and sappy, like I was afraid she might be.  (I was dreading some sort of Emma Watson Hermione Granger high-pitched and exasperated voice).  I thought it was funny that Liam Neeson managed to pop up in this...he seems to be popping up in all of these movies that I've watched recently.The creatures and environment all looked great, buuuut I thought the effects could have been worked on more so that the animals wouldn't look like they came out of a video game.  Aslan looked good most of the time, but sometimes he just looked a bit fuzzy or too fluid-like.....as if he wasn't entirely solid.  But don't listen to me, you may watch it and think they're flawlessly done effects...I don't know.  Other than that, he was extremely likeable and you could feel the mix of killer warrior/nice grandpa-type in him.  Especially cool was the part where he bites off the Witch's head....The Witch, by the way, was well-done too and I liked her evil creatures more than any other secondary people.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1C1GBVSXWYGGE	Anonymous	Watching The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, I felt myself transported into alternate reality of The Lord of the Rings.  Indeed, this film is based on C.S. Lewis' classic novel, and its author was friends with J.R.R. Tolkien at the time.  The Christian story is hinted at in the movie, just as the novel is, but if one expects the film to preach, he or she would be wrong.  This film is wonderful, faithful to the novel in terms of the visuals and the story, and I felt myself truly involved throughout the entire film.The story takes place in 1930's England, when the German army was at the time bombing London.  The Pevensie children, Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter are evacuated to the countryside, where they reside in the museum-like home of the Professor.  The home, full of artifacts, corridors, and winding stairs, ends up becoming an excellent place for a game of hide-and-seek, and it is then that Lucy encounters the wardrobe and enters the world of Narnia, an wintry land that has been ruled by the cold control of the White Witch.The fantastical world of Narnia, I'm glad to say, is given a gradual introduction in terms of special effects.  The first time we enter Narnia, we encounter Mr. Tumnus, a faun, and the subtle effects are amazing.  Over the course of the next hour we are introduced to talking beavers, wolves, and ultimately a massive battle where creatures of all shapes, sizes, myths, and continents (cheetahs leading the front lines) clash.Andrew Adamson, I must note, was a visual effects consultant for the Batman movies, and has directed the Shrek films.  Another filmmaker whose roots began in visual effects was Rob Coleman, who directed the XXX films.  The reason for this reference would be to compare two completely directors and their approaches.  Hands down kudos goes to Adamson for his direction.  This movie has handled the materials between story and visuals excellently.  THe performances were well done, especially by Tilda Swinton as the White Witch.There are six more adaptations on the way.  This film, i must add, has driven me to read all seven novels in the Chronicle until then.  I would highly recommend all other viewers to the same.	5.0	Enter another world	2005-12-12	8	5	3

I haven't watched the extra discs yet but the extended version of the movie was a real disappointment- the only extended things were the chase scenes. More running away from Mrs. Macready and from the Secret Police, etc. So far, it hasn't been worth the 33 dollars extra I spent on the movie, to upgrade from my 2-disc extended edition.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1UXMT6XQFZLA1	"Anthony G Pizza ""trivialtony"""	"CS Lewis defined the 20th century Christian intellectual, and an overarching mission of his writings was repackaging and representing the Christian message for each generation. This meant straight retellings from his own life, (""Surprised by Joy,"" ""A Grief Observed"") fairy tales with subversively Christian allegory and subtext (the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series) logical, reasoned instruction (""Mere Christianity"") and even Christianity inside out through ""Screwtape Letters'"" Satanic reverses.Disney/Walden Media's exceptional retelling of Lewis' ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" now a rich 2DVD set, fills in Lewis' brush strokes but delivers an adventure faithful to his vision. ""Mere Christianity"" states men have been dropped into earth as Enemy territory, and are trying to subvert it for good. Director Andrew Adamsen (""Shrek"") proves this early and grandly. Young Lucy Pevensie, (11-year old Georgie Henley in a cheeky debut) finds the hidden kingdom behind a wardrobe at a home where she, sister Susan (Anna Popplewell) and brothers Peter (William Moseley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) are being sheltered from London's Nazi Blitzkrieg.Without revealing too much story, Adamsen unfolds this fantasy giving human heroes a family's vulnerability, unity, and frailty, and animal characters human senses of community and bravery. The talking beavers and fox here aren't Disney's stock cutesy,wisecracking animals. The White Witch (Tilda Swinton in a literally standout role as the gorgon giantess) successfully captures the hushed tones and inconsistent behavior adults (many of which Lewis didn't respect) use to frighten and intimidate children. Her cruel scenes with young Edmund, allowing her to creep closer to her showdown with troops of the Great Lion Aswar, are among ""Narnia""'s most effective and disturbing.Christian allegory, from Father Christmas' cameo to the children's reunion with Edmund to deep and deeper magic scenes at the Stone Table, prevail but don't overwhelm a story deftly merging the grandeur and character of ""Lord of the Rings,"" the Harry Potter franchise and overtones of ""Passion of the Christ.""  Sadly, Lewis' deeper purpose is downplayed in ""Narnia's"" DVD extra features. These include a making-of documentary, blooper reel, a instructive soundtrack featuring cast commentary and pop-up facts on Lewis' life, and a computer generated Narnia interactive map.Overall, director Adamsen, executive producer (and Lewis stepson) Douglas Gresham and the Walden/Disney team created a labor of supernatural love, drawing on Lewis' fantasy and the  real moral lessons in loyalty, sacrifice, and forgiveness behind it.

Sure there were changes here and there, but it kept to the same basic storyline and totally captured the spirit of C. S. Lewis' masterpiece.Now about the film, It's a great adventure movie full of action and a pretty good Villain, and a great sense of wonder. The acting of the children is amazing and it's so easy to believe they are a family. The action scenes are pretty intense and epic. though the scene where Aslan dies may scare little children.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A24O9KEIL7MYCU	AriesSpaceboy	"The visual style of this film reminded me of the fantasy movies of the 1980's like ""The NeverEnding Story"", ""Return to Oz"" and ""Dark Crystal"". However, much like the modern Harry Potter movies and Star Wars prequels, the filmmakers have diminished character development in favor of large loads of computer effects and action scenes. I would think that a child who sees it without having read the book will be a bit baffled as to why some of these events are taking place.For instance, it's not explained that the movie begins in World War II era London (I think that would help kids who haven't read the book understand why the Pevensie family's home is being bombed), Lucy and Mr. Tumnus meet and 4 minutes later are soul mates and best friends forever (a little more character interaction would have made Tumnus' fate much more meaningful). The beavers explain the great prophecy about as dramatically and effectively as my mom trying to explain an episode of ""Lost"". Before his self-sacrifice, Aslan says and does practically nothing to clue you in as to why he is the savior of Narnia (a few scenes of the kids getting to know more about the history of Narnia and showing Aslan passing on words of wisdom would have raised the emotional level considerably).On the upside...If you HAVE read the book, it's quite fun to watch many of these scenes come to life. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch is spot on! I would eat her turkish delight any day of the week. The little girl who plays Lucy is absolutely perfect. If being adorable were an Olympic event, she would certainly take the gold medal. Also, Aslan's sacrifice is shockingly graphic and disturbing. I think they might have brought in Mel Gibson as guest director for this scene.Speaking of which, all the Christian allegory is here if you're looking for it. It's actually quite subdued. Similar to ""Lord of the Rings"" and the ORIGINAL Star Wars trilogy, this movie stresses the importance of courage, honor and friendship. As our society becomes increasingly more shallow and materialistic with every day that goes by, I welcome a kid's movie like this, even with it's flaws."	4.0	A Pleasant bit o' Fantasy	2006-02-12	11	9	2

This film is often very beautiful, but it is clearly meant to be an imitation of the Lord of the Rings films for children.  The story has been changed to suit modern tastes, or perhaps to bring in an adult audience - i.e., it has been made much more violent and frightening than the original book. A few examples:  The film begins with scenes of the bombing of London, which are not in the book; The witch has been made much more sadistic and creepy; The reindeer pulling her sleigh have been transformed into polar bears; many of the gentle scenes with Father Christmas and the beavers have been greatly reduced; Edmund and the faun are thrown into a dungeon and confronted by a sadistic witch, a completely new scene - in the original, the children merely find the faun turned to stone like the animals in the palace; The children are hunted for a long time by frightening and distorted looking wolves; The humiliation of Aslan before his death has become scary rather than sad; A very brief mention of the final battle has been extended into a detailed and violent scene of at least 20 minutes; and finally, the lighthearted, humorous, safe, and gentle feeling of the book is lost.  The children of 6 years or so that saw the film were very scared during it, and wanted to go home.

Going into the movie I had high hopes and expectations but unfortunately not all of them were met.I thought that the actress who played Lucy completely stole the show and that the rest of the actors came off rather weak.  Another problem I had was how the directors chose to make it seem so epic-esk.  It seemed so over done, like it was competing with Peter Jackson and Lord of the Rings.  Many of the shots were complete rip offs of other big films.  Most notably the one where Peter is fighting the White Witch and she swings her sword and staff right as he leans back, that was such a Matrix moment.Something I do give this film props for is sticking to the story line.  I was so worried that they would take my favorite moments out in favor of keeping it child friendly.  But the film makers kept everything down to the nitty gritty.All in all I still love the BBC, it is simple and everyone has bad teeth but the performances are memorable.  I guess Narnia is just one of those things that is attached to my childhood and any changes take away from the magic for me.	3.0	A little overdone	2006-01-26	7	1	6
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2WX1UESDOLXRE	"Ashley Quinn ""Ash"""	This movie has the most outstanding visual effects. The animals look real. You will really think you're seeing a talking lion, talking beavers, centaurs, and dozens of other magical creatures. I read the books when I was really young; I can't say I remember them, but it was nice going into the film without any preconceived notions about what it SHOULD be, when what this movie IS is just a wonderful movie.The movie is about four children, all who are displaced from WWII, made to live with a professor in his giant house. They can't touch anything, run, shout, or disturb the professor. Lucy, the youngest child, says that hide-and-seek is a fairly quiet game, so all the kids proceed to play, with little Lucy running for cover when she finds a beautifully carved wardrobe. It's the only object in the entire room. She opens the door and hides within a bundle of coats. As she scoots back to hide herself a little more, she suddenly realizes: she's not in the wardrobe any more. She's in Narnia, where she meets a goofy half-man, half-goat creature. Of course, her siblings refuse to believe her, until all of them end up in Narnia as well.The plot is really intricate, that I don't want to go into it all. The point is that this is a really fantastic movie. That's all anyone ever really needs to know. It might be a little scary for small children, but any kid who can watch the Harry Potter flicks without flinching should be just find with this movie. You'll love the stunning the visuals and this simply magical story. So much more goes on this movie that I can't even seem to put into words. Yes, it's that good.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2VMT89TCSF105	"Ashtar Command ""Seeker"""	"""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is an American fantasy movie released in 2005. It's based on a novel by the British writer Clive Staples Lewis. The novel has been adapted for TV or cinema several times before.When I saw an old animated version of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", I considered it a very strange story, but nothing more. People entirely new to the Narnia concept will probably react in similar ways when seeing this American movie version. What on earth is this story about?The truth, of course, is that ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a Christian allegory. If you look carefully, it's all in there. The White Witch is the Devil, the treachery of Edmund symbolizes the fall of Adam and Eve, Aslan is Jesus Christ, and his voluntary sacrifice to save Edmund is the crucifixion. And yes, he comes back and resurrects all the dead. Then comes Judgment Day, when the good battles the forces of evil.Small wonder people think it's a weird storyline...As already mentioned, the story is based on a novel by C.S. Lewis, also titled ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"". (Incidentally, the professor of the story is probably a humorous reference to Lewis himself.) Lewis' express purpose was to write an allegorical Christian novel for children. He later expanded the concept and wrote six additional novels. Together the seven books are known as ""The Chronicles of Narnia"".Frankly, I think this de-Christianized, Americanized and politically correct version of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is much better than the original!The clean shaven, old fashioned kids of the original story (not to mention a notorious British adaptation for TV) are more modern in the movie version. Also, the Christian references are less overt. But the best change concerns the gender roles. Lewis was almost ridiculously patriarchal, so in the original story the girls Lucy and Susan aren't supposed to participate in the final battle between Aslan's forces and the evil legions of the White Witch. And why is the Devil symbolized by a woman, anyway? In the movie, the poor devil is still female, but at least Susan is a soldier. Interestingly, Peter (the older brother) is something of a sceptical wimp!A covertly feminist version of ""The Chronicles of Narnia""? Who could have imagined?The movie even contains unexpected humour, as when the fox delivers the unforgettable one-liner: ""I wish I could say their bark was worse than their bite"". The bickering between Beaver and his wife is also extremely entertaining.This movie adaptation of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" also has an ironic twist. It has *very* obvious similarities with Peter Jackson's successful ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. Indeed, the rip off was clearly visible already in the trailer. The twist, of course, is that C.S. Lewis was personally acquainted with J.R.R. Tolkien. One of Lewis' science fiction novels, ""That hideous strength"", contains a partial cross-over with the Lord of the Rings universe of Tolkien. It's therefore ironic that a movie adaptation of Lewis' Narnia stories mimics movies based on Tolkien. It seems you really cannot separate Lewis and Tolkien!C.S. Lewis was an interesting writer of both Christian fiction and non-fiction. I have given Lewis his due in other reviews. I have to admit, however, that I sometimes tend to get tired at his supernatural musings.

This film is a silly and boring Christian allegory.The children enter a magical wardrobe and are teleported to another world.  Where did the magical wardrobe come from?  Don't ask, it is just there, like Alice jumping down the rabbit hole.If you have read any of the books, you would know this world they have discovered, and all the creatures in it were created by Aslon, who is Christ in the form of a lion.  He is supposed to be so powerful, yet he is to weak to defeat the witch (Satan?), so he convinces these little children who are referred to as the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve, to be his holy warriors and go on a ""Crusade"" for him and defeat the witch(satan?).This movie has everything from poorly animated talking beavers, who look like giant rats, to a raggedy dressed Santa who gives the kids presents to help them on their holy crusade, to creatures from Greek mythology.Aslon ""Christ"" offers his life to save one of the children, and is executed by the witch(satan), not on a cross but on an alter, but you get the idea.  He is then resurrected of course.  Sound a little familiar?There is this great battle between the good and evil creatures at the end of the film, without a single drop of blood being spilt.  BORING!

It leaves nothing out of the main concept that compelled C. S. Lewis, an atheist converted to ""Christianity"" to write it.  He has turned the Bible message into one acceptable to the child and if you will forgive me, but this is not meant to be a pun, but C. S. Lewis nailed it! Jim Broadbent saw its integrity and delivered it with eloqeunce to the screen. The actors chosen for their roles excelled in their parts and Disney projected the story in the light that C. S.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AGG9C66TOLJZB	"A. Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list"""	This has to be one of the best movies I have seen, and one of the best movies adapted from a book I have seen, Congratulations to the director! This is an amazing film and highly recommended in DVD format too - it is something I will be watching again and again.The movie is very faithful to the book which is great. The opening scenes of the film do set a scene which is not in the book although they do help to reinforce why Edmund is so surly with his family. It is war time and he is missing his father dreadfully. The four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund and lucy) are sent to the country to stay with the professor and his very rigid housekeeper.They quickly become bored but try to be good - and play hide and seek. Lucy finds a wardrobe full of fur coats and slips inside - only there is no back to the wardrobe and she slips into the world of Narnia which you can get to through the back of the Wardrobe. It is winter there and she meets Mr Tumnis, a faun who takes her back to his house for tea. (Perhaps not the best message to be sending children in this day and age! yet quite in keeping with the time and genre)When Lucy returns to through the wardrobe she has been away overnight in Narnia, but has only been gone a few seconds in real time. None of the other children believe her story of having gone away, and the wardrobe seems solid. Lucy however is determined to go back, and this time when she goes Edmund follows her but loses her on the other side. He gets pickedup by the white witch who feeds him sweeties (sweets were rationed in Britain during wartime so they would have been a very powerful bribe for a small boy!) and manages to convince him to bring his brother and 2 sisters back to Narnia - Edmund also reveals that Mr Tumnis has harboured his sister.The four children eventually slip into Narnia and the action really begins, Mr Tumnis has been arrested by the secret police (a very scary pack of wolves) and the children are rescued by a pair of cockney beavers who take them to Aslan.Their adventures in Narnia are very much a parable for the crucifixion, Aslan gives up his life for Edmund, to be humiliated and killed on the stone table. Yet, in allowing himself to be a willing sacrifice for man he allows Narnia to survive.This is also all about love, forgiveness and loyalty. The four children are torn by their desire simply to get back to their own world once they have found Edmund again yet they also understand that they must help Narnia fight its battle against the White Witch, who is stronger, and has more troops (and very scary ones at that)The film is amazing. From the animals such as the faun Tumnis and the centaurs (on an intimate scale) to the large army of repellent creatures which the white queen had. On a particular note, I was especially amazed by the two polar bears the queen had pulling her chariot.I felt the children were very well chosen for the parts. They looked appropriate for their roles and they were excellent actors. The actor who played Mr Tumnis was a real scene stealer - utterly superb in the part and just how one would expect a faun to act.It is a longish movie, and quite frightening in parts. It is not something I would want my young children to see but once they get older this is definitely a movie I would like them to see and understand.Just on a final note. Adamsom has learnt a lot from his animation - the shrek movies are amazing, and he has transferred that skill here - the changing perspectives are wonderful. The battle scenes were extraodinary - there is the opening scene where the griffin is flying over the batte field and the camera appears to follow it in its swooping flight path. The scene that keeps coming to my mind mostly when I think of Adamson's skill is where the two armies are galloping towards each other with Peter at the fore. There is music playing as Peter begins his charge, then as they get closer you see them from the side - the two armies drawing nearer and the music finishes to nothing more than a heart beat - it is almost silence. I can hardly describe what I felt to see this, the anticipation is heightened and the drama of it. I felt my heart rise to my throat and realised I was crying. It was at once beautiful and horrible.This is a well crafted film on all levels - the adaptation of the book, the choice of actors, the animation, the direction and, well - everything. I enjoyed it immensely and will be watching it again and again.	5.0	Astounding, Adamson has captured Narnia!	2006-02-06	5	4	1

Just like a lot of other kids. The similarity with other kids ends right there.While playing hide-and-seek, Lucy (the youngest) discovers an old wardrobe in one of the rooms upstairs and hides in it, only to discover that the back of the wardrobe is a gateway into a snow-covered world which is ever so different from the one she left behind. The first ""person"" she meets is Mr. Tumnus, a faun. (He is, by the way, a most charming fellow.) He explains that it has been winter in Narnia for 100 years, ever since the Snow Queen took over. ""Always winter but never Christmas."" How could a child imagine anything more dismal than that?When Lucy goes back through the wardrobe, thinking she had been gone for several hours, she runs out into the stairway shouting, ""I'm here! I'm all right!"" The others accuse her of not understanding the game of hide-and-seek, as to them, she was only gone a moment. The dismiss her story of having been to Narnia as imagination, and who could blame them? It is clear that the professor knew about the magic in the wardrobe, because he perked up and became very interested earlier when only Lucy had been through, and the others told him that she had been telling some tall tale about going through it into a magical world. He argues that since she is not mad, and not given to lying, they might just believe her.When Lucy goes back to the wardrobe in the middle of the night, Edmund follows her, and discovers that it's all true. Before he catches up with Lucy, however, a white sleigh drawn by white reindeer drives up with the Snow Queen. She plies Edmund with hot chocolate and Turkish delight, and tells him to go back and get his brother and sisters. You see, there is this prophecy . . .Anyway, all four children eventually get to Narnia dressed in fur coats that had been hanging in the wardrobe, and encounter a couple of talking beavers who take them to their home and tell them all about the prophecy. Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve will be the ones to rescue Narnia from the clutches of the Snow Queen. However, Edmund slips out to go find the Queen, and from there on, I'd be telling too much.You know about Aslan, no doubt. He's a large and very magical lion who is a rather obvious metaphor for Jesus Christ, right down to being slain and reborn. An army of assorted magical creatures is gathered on the side of Narnia, and some truly grotesque demons and nasty animals (wolves, most notably, and Minotaurs and all sorts of vicious beings, including a few giants) fighting for the Queen. There's a huge battle, all sorts of exciting incidents involved in it, and of course the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve fulfill the prophecy and become kings and queens.Many years later, when they are all fully grown, they come across the lamppost that stands outside the ""back door,"" if you will, of the wardrobe. They go through, and come tumbling out the front of the wardrobe, back in the Professor's home, and still children. When asked to explain to the professor what they have been up to, Peter says, ""If we told you, you wouldn't believe us."" The professor tosses something (I couldn't see what) to Peter and says, ""Try me.""It's a marvelous movie made from a marvelous book, and I hope they eventually make all seven of the books in the series into movies."	5.0	Brilliant Production of a Brilliant Story	2012-05-14	0	0	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1NSMQIF1C2VCE	Beau Yarbrough	Having first read the Chronicles of Narnia in 1979, I had grave misgivings when I heard a movie was being made. I wasn't only concerned about issues such as special effects and where they'd film the movie -- Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies were showing that wasn't much of a problem in the 21st century. I was mostly concerned about the tone and feel of the books, which are charmingly anachronistic.I didn't need to worry after all: The live action The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, if it takes some small liberties with the book, gets the tone and feel of the book perfectly, giving us a battle between good and evil that feels on one level like a children's story, while at the same time having obvious deeper currents to it, some of which can be puzzled out thematically, others of which will (mostly) be revealed in later stories.The casting was also exceptionally well done, with all of the children actually looking like siblings and like real children (not Hollywood actor children creatures) besides. Tilda Swinton is especially good as the White Witch, who plays evil with a sophistication and intelligence rarely seen in movies.For adults, there's also great fun in spotting some of the celebrity voices of the wonderfully animated talking animals. Rupert Everett as the talking fox was an especially witty choice, and perfectly suited to the role.In the end, as long as the film was, it suffers a bit from being an adaptation of a relatively short children's novel, and feels significantly thinner than, say, Peter Jackson's much denser Fellowship of the Ring. This isn't a crippling blow to the movie -- it's still quite enjoyable and makes one eager for the next movie in the series -- but it does mean the film doesn't really bear the repeated rewatchings the extended editions of the Lord of the Rings movies do.Strongly recommended for fantasy fans of all ages and the original Narnia books.	4.0	A fun and faithful fantasy movie, but a lesser film than Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies	2006-04-05	5	3	2

This is very much a child's film that parents should never have any fear of taking home to their family. It's not as grave, or complex, as The Lord of the Rings, and will appeal to both younger children as well as adolescents. At some level, they will all get something out of seeing it. The interplay between good and evil is timeless and as easy to comprehend as anything they might see on a Christmas special. Narnia is a most rewarding tale whose values children may hopefully internalize. Traits like duty, honor, loyalty, and sacrifice are ones of which our society is in great need, and C.S. Lewis identifies and expounds on them here in noble fashion. Perhaps, viewers will be stimulated by the beauty of the story and take a look at his excellent written works like Mere Christianity.	4.0	"""The True Meaning of Sacrifice."""	2006-05-26	1	1	0

The world of Narnia comes alive through today's wonderful special effects, with creatures such as fawns and talking beavers blending seamlessly with the human actors.  And speaking of the latter, the four child actors all do a perfectly credible job, although the youngest two come across the most naturally on the big screen.  The supporting cast also performs well, from Tilda Swinton's icy portrayal of the White Witch to Liam Neeson's majestically-voiced Aslan.  The movie certainly has plenty of adult appeal, yet at its heart, it is still a fantasy story intended mainly for all but the youngest children (the death of Aslan and ensuing battle scene notwithstanding).This 2-Disc Collector's Edition is beautifully packaged but probably only for the most devoted fans.  I enjoyed the ""Bloopers"" included on Disc 1--more than just actual bloopers, these scenes show the actors simply goofing around, with the green screens everywhere providing a glimpse into how the special effects are acheived--but the plethora of footage on Disc 2 (including in-depth information on the creatures of Narnia) was a bit more than I needed.  Certainly this set takes full advantage of the wonders of DVD format, and those who relish these bonuses will have plenty to take pleasure from here.  Overall, this might not go down in history as being a great film, but it is certainly well-done and definitely worth seeing."	4.0	An entertaining, mostly accurate adaptation of the CS Lewis classic	2006-04-09	8	6	2

Edmund had a starring role as the betrayer of his siblings to the non-human witch, thinking he would get some affection.  The movie itself, based on the Narnia book by C. S. Lewis, was supposedly about four English children who were sent to Coombe Halt from wartime London to a place of safety with an elusive professor and his stern housekeeper who enforces house rules.  However, she was a pussycat compared with the mean witch they have to fight for their lives in the ""magic kingdom"" of Nardia.Susan, Lucy, Peter and Edmund descend on a scholarly environment (Lewis' actual high-church Anglican school as an Oxford don), which they found boring and restrictive.  To pass the time, instead of reading, they play 'hide and seek,' managing to disturb the professor who told them to act like a family.  Children from selected schools here who finished reading this first volume and wrote about their impressions as an assignment were rewarded with a special screening of the movie.  They attended Regal theaters the day before the public was able to see it.  I'd been planning for it several months but got to the Carmike-owned theater too late for the first showing as it was ""sold out.""  It was reported that these ""low readers"" now want to read the other six books about Narnia, based on Christian tenets but are full of demons from hell and a pagan ritual of sacrifice.It looked like a Winter Wonderland as they tramped in the snow in the place Lucy discovered after she ""hid"" in a wardrobe full of coats.  She formed a lasting attachment to Thomas, the faun.  Edmund had visions of grandeur.  When the ice melted, we saw strange creatures at the fair with green, green grass and beautiful mountains.  Peter rode the mythical unicorn as he led the war against the witch.  It was a fierce battle of medieval warfare with a firebird.  The winged creatures with huge rocks saved the day.  The cast was full of talking beasts and magical creatures signifying Christian symbolism.The chief of police was a wolf, but got outfoxed by a red fox and a couple of talking beavers.  I didn't care much for the witch played by Tilda Swinton; the dresses wore her instead of vice versa.  She told Edmund about the prophecy which had to be stopped from coming true.  She looked like an English Gweneth Paltrow in her overlarge garments.

Though they were adults before leaving Narnia, they return still children.  There are two new  biographies about the author, THE NARNIAN, by Alan Jacobs and JACK'S LIFE by Doug Gresham who was a producer of this movie.  His mother Joy married Jack Lewis in later life.  It was reported in 'Time' magazine that 95 million of these books have been sold since Lewis' death in 1963.It was not an enjoyable movie, but it was somewhat different from others of its genre.  It was a little overdone with the war violence and hype of half-human creatures from the underworld to show the theological issues of Lewis' day; his fantasy series for children were the bestsellers then and again today, thanks to this production."	3.0	Lucy Finds Her Wonderland In a Wardrobe.	2005-12-09	10	3	7

While the film was not 100% true to the novel, it was spellbinding none the less!If I had to chose a fav role, it would have to brave little Lucy. She was never afraid to push on, to do what needed to be done. I think we could all learn form that role.One aspect that I enjoyed about this movie was what wasn't in it. There was no cursing, I hate cursing in films. There were battle scenes minus the gore. It truly is possible to portray warfar without being graffic in nature.

Yes, that's right. The deal is this: A witch wants to take over and needs the kids in order to do it. This is the trouble that drives the movie. If it doesn't sound that impressive, it isn't. I checked out this movie not expecting it to be as good as something like Lord of the Rings, but thinking it may at least be as interesting as a Harry Potter movie. Instead I got some goofy movie I almost couldn't watch. There is nothing suspenseful or surprising at all, which is fine for toddlers I guess. As for the acting, the kids in the movie are boring and sometimes even annoying. There really is no reason to root for them, (or for Narnia to be saved for that matter). None of them have interesting or endearing personalities or anything to identify with. And the villains? OMG - The witch looks like a freaky drag queen, and her little elf thingy speaks in a voice that = nails on chalkboard. The kids meet allies in the form of CGI beavers and centaurs and a big fake ""Mufasa"" Lion King (who is actually the only cool thing in the movie). There is also some weirdo named Mr. Tumnus whose costume/make-up looks as weak as something off Star Trek or Stargate or something. The dialog is also weak and the biblical mythology just seems out of place for something that is supposed to be of the fantasy genre. The battle scenes are terrible as well and look fake and silly, and not just becuse there is no blood. Still, I give this 3 stars because it is a movie that will work for little kids or people who still like that David Bowie movie, Labyrinth. Adults: don't expect much to this other than it will please your kids. Otherwise, for all its special effects and hoopla, it's not even as good as old school classics like The Princess Bride or The Neverending Story."	3.0	Kids movie without adult appeal	2006-10-18	2	1	1

So last weekend I watched the movie and it was pretty good but nothing really to write home about. The movie is long and I started to become bored towards the middle of it. I didn't care too much for the children except for Lucy who was an absolute doll. In the fighting seen there were a few gryphons who were turned into stone while in flight and crashed into pieces. I wonder if Aslan was able to bring them back to life? Who knows. The White Witch had the craziest hairstyles and her wardrobe could've been better.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	`The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe', cowritten and directed by Andrew Adamson, is a story based on the first of seven books for adolescents by the 20th century scholar, poet, and Christian apologist, C. S. Lewis. It is a great coincidence that this movie would probably not have been made, or at least not made now, if it were not for the great success of the three `The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. The coincidence is that not only were the two authors, C. S. Lewis and J.R.R.Tolkien great friends, they were literally colleagues as dons at Oxford in very similar disciplines. And, they both read one another's poems and fiction as avidly as they probably read one another's scholarly works.In the final analysis, I feel this movie holds the same relation to the `...Rings' movies as the books do when I read them for the first time over 40 years ago. Tolkien's great novel (it is not really a trilogy) is a great epic fantasy that no amount of scholarship can cleanly map it to worldly events or concerns. This disconnect from the world of the mid-20th century is clear from many of the author's pronouncements. Lewis' series, on the other hand is a loosely connected series of seven stories of significantly lesser dramatic merit and the stories are all directly and pretty obviously written as advertisements for Christian doctrines. A quick look at Lewis' other major works such as `The Screwtape Letters' and `Mere Christianity' will give one a quick sense that Christian doctrine was front and center in all of Lewis' non-academic works. The problem is that while this allegory may help communicate Christian doctrine, it tends to spoil the story from a literary and dramatic point of view.That is not to say this is a poor movie. In fact, I would rate the quality of the moviemaking to be even superior to the various `Harry Potter' films, at least for the first half of the Narnia story. I will even go so far as to say it rivals the quality of `Lord of the Rings' right up to the appearance of the Father Christmas character, which immediately takes the whole level of storytelling down a notch and lets the sour note of `deux ex machina' into the tale. This `happy accident' escape from peril may be one of the reasons Peter Jackson took the Tom Bombadil chapters out of `The Fellowship of the Ring' screenplay, aside from the fact that this episode did little to move the story forward.A quick look at the published volume of `The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe' will reveal that it is a really rather thin book, and the filmmakers did a great job of bulking it up. The problem is that there is absolutely none of the depth we find in the `...Rings' story.This is the first of seven short novels where the principle characters are four young English children who find themselves entwined in the legends of a mysterious world accessed through the back of a wardrobe in a spare room of a country manor house. The principle antagonists in this land of Narnia are the human White Witch, leading an assortment of talking animals and mythical creatures and Aslan, a speaking lion who is the nominal leader of another band of talking animals and mythical creatures. There is little logic to which creatures side with the witch and which side with Aslan, so you soon stop caring that centaurs are good guys and minotaurs are bad guys.The heart of the matter is the Christian story of a nominal `king' sacrificing himself willingly for the lives and salvation of sinners, only to be reborn, raise dead creatures (petrified by the White Witch) back to life, and thereby carry the field of battle with the evil witch. My problem with the storytelling is that all this is played out in the foreground with very little narrative groundwork laid for the premise of the whole story. In contrast, you know in chapter 2 of `The Fellowship of the Ring' what the peril is and how it must be faced and resolved 32 long chapters later. On top of all this, in spite of the heavy and well documented borrowing from northern European myths, the `...Rings' story is remarkably cohesive, hanging together well from chapter to chapter, slowly building on its firm internal logic to a most satisfying conclusion.On the other hand, the `Narnia' story is so thin, the bare bones of all the borrowings and similarities to the likes of `Alice in Wonderland', `The Wizard of Oz', Christmas lore, mythical Greek creatures, and the Bible seem to stick out here and there. Thus, `The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' remains a very good young teenager's story, the best of the series by far.Before Peter Jackson got the rights to `Lord of the Rings', my greatest fear was that Disney would get the rights and do a `nice' version of the story. I had the same fear with this movie, but I am happy to say that they brought their great skill, but not their saccharine outlook to this story. All through the first half of the film, I was totally hooked by the quality of the filmmaking and the acting by the four young leads. I was convinced that this was far better than `Harry Potter' and a true rival to `...Rings'. I was especially liking the portrayal of Jadis, the witch. But then, the weaknesses in the story started unraveling the fabric of my belief in the characters and their situation when the `just in time' rescues started playing out.The extras on the DVD are a bit better than average. The cutsie `fun facts' add-in is very nice, but none of the material seems to give proper center stage to author Lewis' Christian theme.	5.0	Half great, half ok.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	"Young Lucy Pevenise, along with her older brothers Edmund and Peter, and her older sister, Susan, are in London during the initial bombing raids of WW II. And like many families of the time, the parents decide to send them to the country for safer keeping. Peter, the oldest, is told by their mother to ""watch over them"" and make sure they stay safe. And although this seems like a fairly simple request, Peter's ability to protect his siblings will be put to the ultimate test. But not by WW II, but by an amazing secret discovered by young Lucy.Soon after being spirited into the company of a hermit-like professor's care (Jim Broadbent), they decide to play hide-and-seek, and it's during this game which Lucy discovers a mysterious wardrobe. She tucks herself inside and backs to the rear of the cabinet ...only to discover herself in an entirely different world. Here she meets up with Mr. Tumnus, a strange half-stag, half-human creature who explains much about the wintry landscape Lucy now finds herself in. The place is called Narnia, and it's been locked in winter for over 100 years by someone known as ""The White Witch"" (who claims to be the Queen of Narnia).Lucy, excited beyond words, rushes back to ""the real world"" to tell her brothers and sister about what she's discovered and, of course, they don't believe her ...until they all get into the wardrobe one day and find out she's been telling the truth.Soon a prophecy is revealed to the two brothers and two sisters: it is said that when Aslan returns, two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam will come back and reclaim the four thrones of Narnia. But first they have to battle The White Witch, struggle with the internal dynamics of sibling rivalries, and face the death of the very creature who helped create this strange world.______________________________________________________________________________Comparisons abound between NARNIA and THE LORD OF THE RINGS. And why not. Both are fantasy tales. Both authors (Lewis and Tolkien) were friends during the same era. And both stories have recently made it to the silver screen. And although my heart still rests with THE LORD OF THE RINGS, NARNIA deserves much praise.But this praise doesn't necessarily come from me...I went to the theater today (a weekend) and it was packed with children (ranging in age from their teens to five years old), and while watching it I noticed something intriguing: not a single interruption occurred during the entire 140 minutes. No crying child asking to go home; no temper tantrums; no shushing of mothers and fathers to their kids. I think this speaks pretty highly of how engaged this film kept its intended audience. I will say that when Aslan became ""injured"" there were gasps of dismay from a couple of kids behind me and they quietly asked their mother if ""Aslan was going to be okay"" (I have to admit, that was pretty cute).Georgie Henley (Lucy) was exquisite as one of the prime characters (move over Dakota Fanning). Her acting was spot-on and brought a lump to my throat several times. Liam Neeson's Aslan voice was also perfect with its deep resonance that seemed to echo through the theater (must've been a good sound recording). Tilda Swinton was also excellent as the sinister White Witch who rules Narnia with a cold, iron fist. And James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus was also pulled off very well.There've been several reviews (professional) that have been critical of the film's Christian-based theological leanings. Well ...yes. That's true. It does have that, but so did C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles novels. So did this bother me? Not at all. I don't prescribe to any particular faith, and if you go into NARNIA with an anti-religious chip on your shoulder, I'm sure you could rip the film apart. But if you go into the theater strictly to enjoy good storytelling and for entertainment, you'll probably delight in NARNIA just as much as the ten-year-old who sat behind me quietly throughout the entire movie."	5.0	Watch It For The Entertainment Value	2005-12-11	490	429	61

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1H5C8YG6IQXK1	"Bozhoo ""DooWiki"""	Overall, this is a fine film. But no film can ever be as good as it's original source - the book - nor can it compete with nostalgia if you are one of many, many who read the book as a child. Also keep in mind, the book is a CHILDREN's book, a thin little thing packed with imagination but not a lot of details that could be translated into cinema.Viewing this movie as an adult, I realize I'm tainted by the stuffed-to-the-gills ever-escalating action, drama, and suspense of modern cinema, needing to be stimulated for every frame of film, including the credits just so I'll stick around and happen to read the names of all the people who put in some hard work to entertain me for two hours. If I expect a modern epic, I'll be sorely disappointed. But if I watch this film as a classic retelling (and the best rendition to date) of a beautiful children's tale, I'm delighted. It's also refreshing just to sit back and enjoy a story without being jolted by garish imagery or jarred by frenetic music jamming the urgency of the scene into my ears.As for Christian overtones, all I see is a universally heroic act of one creature's sacrifice to save others, usurping an evil magic - and magic is all the rage with this generation. The story is fun, sends a good message about family and forgiveness, and has a typical fantasy ending. The evil threat is menacing, but not so dark it glorifies. The CG and actors blend well. The costuming is detailed and believable.As I said, nothing can live up to the cherished memories of nostalgia. That's why I give this movie four stars instead of the five it deserves.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1YB29BIDULEYE	"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch"""	This movie is beautifully done. I don't deny that. But if you read the book, and are looking for a film that follows it closely, you are much better off with the older 1979 animated version.If you're on this site, you probably already know the basic story. The 4 children Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy move into the country to escape the bombings in London during WW II. Lucy finds the kingdom of Narnia behind the wardrobe. Edmund (a bit bratty) taunts her for it, and continues to deny it even when he sees it. Eventually all 4 make it into Narnia where they learn that there is an evil queen who always makes certain that it's always winter and never Christmas. However, there is hope. Aslan the Christ Lion is coming to put an end to her power.Edmund (not knowing what to think) defects to the evil queen. However, he has a change of heart. Then to save Edmund, Aslan has to go through the agony and sorrow of Good Friday. But then the glorious joy of Easter Sunday follows. And then comes the task of putting an end to the evil queen.The strange thing about this version is that it's beautifully done. (No doubt.) But the 1979 version was an hour shorter and it  followed the book more accurately,  The strange thing about this newer movie is that it's an hour longer than the 1979 animated version. And with all the things they add, they took out some really important things. (Things included in the 1979 animated version mind you.)If you just read the book or watched the 1979 animated version, you're probably going to notice many things missing.(1) The part when the professor explains to Susan and Peter that Narnia could very well have a time of its own that doesn't take any of our time, (2) The part where Mr. and Mrs. Beaver explain the prophecy involving Cair Paravel as well as how the queen would like for everyone to THINK she's human, (3) The part where Aslan and the queen chat and Mr. Beaver offers a moment of recognition as to how the queen thought she had the right of Narnia.I don't want to get into EVERY difference, because then this review will go on forever. But it is strange that while this recent movie is an hour longer than the 1979 animated version, they would cut out key moments like these.One minor complaint I have is that Edmund is not nasty enough in the 1st half. It's because Edmund is so nasty in the 1st half, that his redemption is so underlined once the halfway  point hits. After being so nasty for so long, he pleads for the lives of the animals having a picnic. It's Edmund's very nasty early character that makes it so powerful when C.S. Lewis writes: &#34;And Edmund for the first time in this story felt sorry for someone besides himself.&#34; (To say nothing of the fact that in the end, it's Edmund who rises from his nasty past, shows extreme courage, and risks himself to destroy the power of the evil queen.)But like I said, it is a very beautifully done movie. The scenery and costumes are nice. And despite it's 2 1/2 hour length, the film moves at a great pace. And there is no denying that Liam Neeson gives Aslan the perfect voice.I'm just saying that as beautiful and great as the film is, don't expect it to follow the book so closely.	4.0	Beautiful, But Not Very Accurate	2013-11-03	0	0	0

Lewis' book really comes to life. The creatures and the white witch are all brilliantly portrayed. I read that Walden Media is the one who kept Narnia true to the novel and I for one am glad they made this film. Almost the whole thing matches up to the book. I am 15 years old and my dad and I both read these books and loved the movie. The film caught your attention from the first moment and never let go until it was over ,and even after it was over you still keep thinking about it. Aslan was as strong and majestic as he is in the book. You do not need to have read the book to love and enjoy the movie, although some pieces may be a little confusing. Georgie Henley as Lucy was great she is a star in the making. The other actors are also very good but didn't steal the show like Georgie. Although the film is rated PG the battle scene and the scene where Aslan is killed Might be pretty scary for younger kids. I assure you if you see this movie you will not be disappointed. This movie will be a favorite for many generations to come.My family and I all hope that they make all seven books into movies.	5.0	Awesome Adventure For The Whole Family!!!	2006-03-08	8	6	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A11HS61C8QVYED	B. Reiser	I love C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia series and I was very excited when this movie came out.  I was even more excited that they were true to the book and adds very little to the movie story line.  I understand movies need to change a few things to make the visual story line move along, but the producer of this movie didn't see a need to do that and the movie follows the book almost 100%.  It is by far the closest to the book as compared to the other Narnia movies that have been produced (Prince Caspian, which followed about 85% of the book, and Voyage of the Dawn Treader, which followed about 60% of the book).  I hope for future Narnia movies they get back to trying to stay closer to the book story lines which I believe most fans of the series would like to see.  Maybe that is why this is my favorite movie of all the Narnia movies so far.	5.0	Great Adaptation of Book	2013-04-07	0	0	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AL2LECOPU3YVP	"Brian D. White ""Lightning05"""	I was truly taken aback by the quality of this production and consider it to be the best non-animated film that Disney has ever produced. The acting is incredible, the special effects are phenomenal, and the story is wonderfully compelling. It mirrors the book very closely, though does have some noticeable, though rather harmless differences. I would point these out, but I don't want to ruin this amazing movie for people who haven't seen it. In my opinion, the differences enhance the movie rather than detract from it. There are many Christian themes in it that I greatly enjoyed--such as forgiveness--that are very powerful. Even people who have no prior interest in movies with fantasy characters, such as my mother (who loved the movie), will most likely find the profoundness of the story more compelling than the strangeness of the creatures. If you are looking for a great movie that incorporates Christian themes into a truly unique and extraordinary story, look no farther than the Chronicles of Narnia.	5.0	One of the Best Book to Movie Translations Ever Produced	2006-06-01	3	1	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"Nominated for three Academy Awards, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe follows on the heels of recent successful big screen adaptations of other childrens' fantasy novels such as The Lord of the Rings books and the Harry Potter series. But while each of these series feature underlying tones of Christian symbolism, The Chronicles of Narnia is overtly intended as a Christian allegory. Written by the brilliant 20th Century Oxford and Cambridge literature professor C.S. Lewis, the Narnia stories were a tribute to his deep Christian faith. And this big screen transition is something of which he can be proud. Directed by Andrew Adamson, veteran director of the Shrek franchise, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is a master blend of traditional human acting and computer generated imagery.The film follows the exploits of the four Pevensie children, two brothers and two sisters. Set during the early years of World War II, their mother sends them away to the countryside in order to escape the relentless Nazi bombing raids on London. Left to their own devices in the cavernous mansion of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent), they engage in a traditional game of hide-and-seek, whereupon the youngest of children, Lucy (Georgie Henley) crawls into a lone wardrobe stationed in an otherwise empty room. Backing her way through the garments, she stumbles into a wintry wonderland where she encounters a faun named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy).Initially, Mr. Tumnus tries to kidnap the young girl, but he experiences a change of heart due to the kindness of her spirit. As a result, he reveals to her the truth about the land into which she stumbled. Narnia is dominated by the evil White Witch who claims to be ruler of the forest, but the true ruler is a lion named Aslan who prophesied long ago that two ""sons of Adam"" and ""daughters of Eve"" would usher in the end of the one hundred year darkness administered by the White Witch. Knowing the prophecy, the witch intends to murder the children upon their arrival. But when Lucy relays the facts of the adventure to her family, they don't believe her.Despite their initial reservations, her older siblings - Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Susan (Anna Popplewell), and Peter (William Moseley) - all find their way into the magical land of Narnia. With talking trees, a forest filled with danger, and an evil witch in hot pursuit, the Pevensie kids must navigate their way through the treacherous land in order to find Aslan (Liam Neeson), the Messianic lion king who can help them to fulfill their rightful destiny as heirs to the thrones of Narnia...Aided by an outstanding soundtrack which perfectly compliments each sequence of events, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is an inspiring film of epic proportions. For Christians, it will have significant meaning far in excess of a traditional film. For instance, the climatic scene of the film in which Aslan provides the ultimate sacrifice will evoke images of Roman soldiers beating and mocking Jesus in the hours leading up to his crucifixion. It's undeniably the most powerful scene of the film. Meanwhile, Georgie Henley turns in an unforgettable performance as the innocent and playful Lucy. Her charisma exudes from the screen in a manner rarely common to child actors. This performance is complimented by Tilda Swinton who is magnificently cast in the role of the White Witch. She simultaneously displays the satanic traits of seductive beauty and ruthless cunning with heavenly perfection. Add a final battle sequence reminiscent of Braveheart, and you've got a blockbuster movie the whole family can enjoy. Although parents of small children who scare easily should take note that some of the scenes can be frightening, but probably no more frightening than Darth Vader and the aliens from Star Wars. Nevertheless, parents should preview the film before introducing it to young children. Overall, this first film in The Chronicles of Narnia series is well worth any movie-goer's attention..."	4.0	An outstanding film that does the book justice...	2006-04-27	2	2	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3EW2L59UBHQSG	Bruce Aguilar	I was not impresed with the book when I read it earlier this year, so I didn't have much excitement for this movie, so you can imagine my surprise when I noticed I was totally engrossed in the movie.  The first 45 minutes of the film are prefect.  Perfect!  I can't think of one thing that could make it any better.  The introduction of the children and their discovery of Narnia is done so beautifully that I think I could watch it over and over again for years and years.  It's charming, magical, filled with fantasy and an ease of storytelling that is rarely seen in these kinds of big-budget Hollywood franchise builders.Strangely, once the main plot of the story gets underway, the stroy begins to drag a bit and never fully recovers, but the characters that I connected with beforehand kept me interested and right with them to the exciting climax.The story does have a lot of violence but it's not gratuitous and no blood is shown (though I think a bit more realism in this area would make the film better).  There is plenty in the film to make small children frightened.  In fact I heard a few begin to to cry at various times in the theater.  Still, I think most children over 8 will enjoy the film immensley.  If your children were fine watching the Harry Potter films, then they should have no trouble watching The Chronicles of Narnia as well.The DVD is jam-packed with extras including features dedicated to the director, the child actors and practically every character in the story.  You'll not only learn abut how the movie was shot and props were made, but you'll also get fun glimpses backstage like the fun song the cast made during the filming.  At times, the extras disc is so comprehensive that I felt like I was watching the bonus material for The Lord Of The Rings but fun things like the song keep popping up and kept me entertained.  Also included are a virtual map with descriptions of each area and a timeline that visualizes the the difference from our world and Narnia.People of all ages and interests are sure to enjoy not only the wonderful movie but the highly entertaining bonus material as well.	4.0	Let The Chronicles Reign	2005-12-29	1	0	1

As an adaption and an individual movie, it doesn't capture the world of C. S. Lewis. The acting is terrible, (especially the casting of the white witch.....

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3JPFWKS83R49V	"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey"""	"Based on the classic novel from C.S. Lewis, this film is destined to become a classic in its own right. It is a family- type movie that parallels the book very closely as it follows four kids on their journey to the land of Narnia where they find themselves locked in a battle between good and evil.There are many reasons to enjoy this movie but let's start with the film's strongest point of all: Its special effects and make-up. The land of Narnia is populated with many different creatures, some of whom look mostly human; some which look like ordinary animals; and some who resemble a hybrid between an animal and a person. The special effects offered here are excellent, and the team in charge of making this movie deserves extra credit for making these characters seem so life like. Among the characters that are part human and part animal, the ones that stand out are the man/horse creatures. They feature a man's face, arms, and torso attached to the body of a horse and they look very real. With the creatures that are entirely animalistic- like the two beavers- the special effects are still excellent because the appearance is just like the real thing. And the mouth movements are very realistic- so much so that you forget you are viewing something created in a studio.The most impressive of all the characters is that of Aslan, the Lion. This ""character"" looks just like an actual lion, with a mouth that moves in sync with each word he speaks- exactly like a person who is speaking the same words. Again, the special effects are near- perfect. You cannot tell you are looking at an object created in a Disney studio. It seems very life- like in every way.Besides the excellent special effects, there are many other reasons to enjoy this movie. There is a nice assortment of suspense, humor, fear, and other emotions and many of them come out of nowhere. They keep the film less predictable than it otherwise would be, and that says a lot when you consider that this film is based on a book. I also like the cinematography. The landscape is snowy at first but then switches to a lush, green, mountainous terrain later in the film. This movie was shot in New Zealand (even though it is supposed to take place in England) and the beauty of the New Zealand countryside adds greatly to the film's appeal.Performances in this film are top- notch and I was especially impressed by Georgie Henley, the young actress who plays Lucy. She is the most expressive of the four kid's characters, displaying an array of emotions with conviction, just like a seasoned Hollywood professional. The others are all very good, too, and they all deserve credit for adding so much to this movie.The overall plot of this film is enjoyable and complete- free from any empty holes that leave the viewer puzzled and annoyed. It is also fast- paced, with many scenes depicting fights and open battles as the kids and Aslan take on the evil witch and the various forces of evil.Overall, this is a very good motion picture and the type that most people will find entertaining and memorable. It is great for the entire family, and it will likely be one of the top movies this Holiday season."	5.0	An Excellent Family Film	2005-12-09	13	9	4

I love Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, but I think this is even better, partly because the makers of this film had the advantage of using a shorter source material, so they could still be faithful without cramming in so much stuff in such a short amount of time.  This film follows almost perfectly well with the book.  I don't see why fans should be disappointed just because the film makes a few changes to the story.  Neither do I see how one could escape the charm of the actors.  The actors do a perfect job at capturing the emotion of the characters.  They really live up to how CS Lewis wanted it to be.  It was just as I imagined it when I read the book.  I was especially pleased with how by staying so true to the book, they remained true to Lewis's powerful message and allegory of Christ.  The battle was very exciting.  Some people have considered the Lord of the Rings trilogy to be the best films ever made, but much as I love Lord of the Rings, this is even better.	5.0	Possibly one of the best movies out there.	2006-01-02	5	3	2

I am hoping after you saw the Lord of the Rings series and the Harry Potter series you now understand the movies can never portray everything in the books. If they did we would have to spend days at the movie theater instead of a few hours. They did at least do a great job of bringing most the key elements from the books. I must admit I myself was a little disappointed in the scene when Aslan is slain. My guess is they toned it down a bit for a younger audience. That I guess is not such a bad thing. Overall a great job of putting it together. Good acting, directing, sets, special effects, and music. I recommend it for the whole family. Even the little ones should not be to frightened by this movie. Compared to the original BBC version Disney has jumped to lightspeed in the Millenium Falcon. The special effects in the original BBC version were somewhat cheesy. They meant well and I still enjoy watching them, but they are no match for the caliber of costumes and F/X in this movie.	4.0	Chronicles of Movies	2006-03-10	9	7	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AOXC7HI3O8JWI	"Carlo San Juan ""Caz MD"""	I have not read any of C.S. Lewis' work.  Thus, I entered the movie theater as any movie-goer should, with an absolutely open mind.  What I saw was something I haven't seen since Die Unendliche Geschicht (aka The NeverEnding Story), a deep yet simple and utterly fantastic film which completely captures your imagination and immerses you into a whole new world which is strangely empathic and familiar.The Pevensie children, Peter, Lucy, Edmund, and Susan (William Moseley, Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, and Anna Popplewell) are sent away from the city (I'm assuming it's London) to escape the German night bombing raids sometime in World War II.  They are assigned to live with an introvert Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent) in the countryside.  The children stumble into a mysterious wardrobe which turns out to be a portal into another world, Narnia.Narnia, it seems, has been experiencing winter for the past 100 years.  The White Witch (a chillingly terrific Tilda Swinton) has been ruling the land as a dictator, terrorizing the animal-folk and fantastic creatures with her cold, dark magic.  Standing against her are almost all the creatures of Narnia save wolves, Minotaurs, giants, cyclopses, and dwarves.  Under the rule of the Lion, Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), everything from fauns, centaurs, griffins, cheetahs, rhinos, beavers, to rats prepare to fight against the White Witch.And there always has to be a prophecy... that four humans will arrive to defeat the White Witch.I have heard complaints that the film was too long.  I didn't feel this as the movie completely captured my interest.There's the whole discussion about how Aslan may represent Jesus Christ.  I didn't understand this until I saw the film.  The similarities are evident, especially at the film's most heart-wrenching moment (I should find it strange that I felt more anguish watching a Lion suffer shame than Jim Caviezel).The acting is surprisingly top-notch.  Even Liam Neeson, who has played many a king and knight (even of the Jedi variety) in his career, outdid himself in Narnia.  But most striking of all performances is Tilda Swinton as the White Witch.  She is magnificently cunning and utterly evil here.  Her eyes are dark, empty pools.  It is clear that she is powerful and that the forces of good truly have their work cut out for them to defeat her.Costumes and special effects are the best I've seen to date.  Industrial Light and Magic have proven themselves once again as the frontrunner of computer generated imagery.  As wind blows through the field of battle, feathers on a griffin ruffle appropriately.  These are the most photorealistic effects I have ever seen.  My one gripe is when the girls rode on Aslan's back.  That seemed horrendously fake.  My thoughts go back to Obi-Wan Kenobi riding a giant lizard in Revenge of the Sith which actually seemed more real.As for the battle, I probably would have fought it differently.  But I'm just griping.All in all, this is a perfectly enjoyable film for all ages.  Filled with depth, imagination, and heart, Narnia is a joy to behold.	5.0	A wonderfully realized movie.

Sadly the director - or producers, paid little attention to the alter ego that was intent on building a masterpiece.What's good - Cinematography, some of the special effects, original story, children will probably enjoy it.What's not - The child actors are below average or are poorly directed, important elements of the storyline are left out, none of the characters are well delineatedThe producers for better or worse decided to cut their losses and turned an unfinished mess over to the editors.

It may not show blood like a lot of people commplaned about.  But it is still worth wathing.  The battle scene is wright up there with the one's in the lord of the rings films.  There is so mush I can say about this film.  But I dont want to spoll the story.  All I have to say is that the acting is good.  The music is good.  The c.g.i. is good.  This is my faverite film of all time.	5.0	one of the best films ever made	2006-04-14	5	3	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AU9L8XDJ8W72M	Choose Life	The love in Lucy's heart and the wonderland was refreshing. But somehow that didn't seem to go with Santa handing a little girl a dagger, the older girl a bow and arrows and the older boy a broad sword. If we truly love other human beings as we have been loved by Christ(the perfect law)there's no record of wrongs.  We don't imagine the worst or judge them but instead love them as if they are us and that is totally and through it all with a worth that nothing has ever diminished even giving them joy, peace, kindness and healing for any sadness they may bring.  So judging the younger boy as a traitor violating some unreal, anti-human, ancient eye for an eye deep magic (the imperfect laws) Moses brought back from the Egypt that got in him, was to me the direct opposite of the cross and of the Christ who showed us the true nature of Divinity by asking us not to do such things to each other and also asked us to bless our human enemies in thought, word and deed, not to go repay a hurt with a hurt much less take revenge running them through with swords and destroying them (or the tares in them). For all of history up to one second ago proves that doing these and labeling people has nearly always vastly multiplied enemies and/or destroyed the beautiful wholeness in the wheat along with the tares, sadistically and hypocritically ruining human lives and families for generations.  The only thing the Bread of Life desires for all of us here and now is to see ourselves as having grown bigger but not greater, to be free and to totally forgive all others.  And to once again be loved and love, have life and give life and race with joy, with an untroubled heart, in perfect peace about ourselves, about others and about life, in wholeness, living in harmony with ourselves and with others just as we did when we were children. Please, let's never look for the bad in mankind, expecting to find it, for we surely do find what we come to see. Instead let's find both old and new friends to cheer and many things to be glad about. Let's see ourselves, others and life as the very best.May we have and give Joy for our Bread is Life and Life is Joy,Choose Life	3.0	Liked the love not the violence	2012-11-07	4	0	4

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3N8RZSXKN1OR2	Chrijeff	"This almost-epic-length film is far superior to the TV version of a few years ago, as we might expect given the rapid development of SFX technology.  It's also an almost exact copy of the classic book, with only a few scenes (not very vital) left out.  By now probably everyone knows the story: the four Pevensy children are sent away from London during the Blitz and end up at a rambling old country house inhabited by aged Prof. Kirke and his housekeeper; youngest Lucy inadvertantly blunders into the magical land of Narnia by way of a magical wardrobe and is befriended by a faun named Tumnus, tries to convince her sister and brothers of the reality of her experience, is followed in a second time by Edmund (who meets the infamous White Witch, self-proclaimed Queen of Narnia, and is tricked into becoming her agent), and a third time by all three of them; they discover that Tumnus has been arrested by the Queen's Secret Police (wolves), are befriended by a pair of talking Beavers, learn that they are the foretold saviors of the land, and after extended trails (and Edmund's temporary defection) finally meet and make common cause with Aslan, the great Lion, who has assembled an army for them to lead against the Witch and her partisans.Of course if you've read the book you know ahead of time how it's all going to turn out, and the real enjoyment comes from seeing how the scriptwriters and director have translated the story to film and how the SFX department has made the magic of Narnia come alive.  I don't think I've seen better effects since the first chapter of ""Star Wars"" burst upon an astounded world 30 years ago.  Even though you know that the creatures of Narnia are computer-generated, they seem so lifelike that you root for the good ones and (mentally) hiss the bad guys: standouts include Aslan (of course), whose facial expressions haven't been equalled by an effects-created creature since ""Dragonheart,"" the centaurs in his army (one of whom serves as Peter Pevensy's second-in-command), and the Witch's force, a wonderfully-imagined stew of ugliness including her General, who appears to be a Minotaur.  There are even cheetahs in the good army and tigers in the evil one whose movements are completely true to what you've seen in nature films.  The climactic battle (which was apparently filmed in New Zealand) is absolutely unforgettable, including a clashing, crashing confrontation between Peter and the Witch, the latter armed with not one but two swords and swinging them around like broomsticks.  (And the music that plays under the action makes you want to rush right out and get the soundtrack CD.)  And, as has been mentioned by another reviewer, just when you think the story has ended and the credits have started to roll, there's a little surprise that isn't in the book but looks forward to revelations of a later volume in the series.  (Recently while at my local theater to see another flick, I noticed a poster for a forthcoming release of ""Prince Caspian,"" the second book in the Chronicles, so it looks as if we can hope to see all seven adapted to film in the next few years.)  Well-paced, splendidly visualized, and just scary enough to give youngsters some delicious thrills (and maybe, admittedly, a nightmare or two), this is DVD that should be in everyone's permanent collection; it's definitely going to join mine."	5.0	A wonderful adaptation!	2008-01-28	3	1	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A25TDEGIPHZTZS	"chris banez lim ""Crutchead"""	"I have just seen this movie yesterday as of this writing (wherein i'm also undergoing with my reading of the Complete Chronicles of NARNIA by C.S. Lewis where this movie is based from - in particular the second part: THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE), this here epic children's fiction story of C.S. LEWIS' allegorical depiction of the parallels and meaning behind Christ's (represented by Aslan) purpose here on earth and the ongoing battle within humans in God's creation against the forces of Evil...and I find it to be as one of the best movies to come around not only for the year, but from the few previous years - which is not turning out that quite bad at all- considering that with all of the good books' reissues and boxed sets that we are seeing along with the movie-lizations for such as the HARRY POTTER series by J.K. Rowling, and Roald Dahl's and for L.O.T.R. by C.S. Lewis' own comrade J.R.R. Tolkein, it ain't so bad at all to spice up what turns out for the movie industry since the turn of the century.Those of the actors that starred in this movie are a certain cast of unknowns, which works at times for several movies, and I guess perhaps by not cashing on to herald known stars for the movie- it's such way to tell in the intent of the moviemakers at times as to indicate that the producers are not opting for a commercial appeal a bit but more on for the focus about the motion pictures artistic(al) values, or perhaps being that much of the budget are all spent out and used already for the setttings and the effects - they do not have enough money to afford big-named stars; however a new lease for Qui Gon Jinn is featured as the voice of Aslan (the Lion King may i say, with no intended pun for the other Disney animated flick feature) which is thus performed by no other than Liam Neeson.It quite bothered me though about the hankie that the youngest girl in the story Lucy gave to the faun, which the Beaver have given back to the little girl upon the capture of the said faun -and later on the flick we find that the faun hand it back to Lucysaying ""you need this more than I do"" (?)Such are a bit of the puzzling things (or errors) in this epic by C.S. Lewis.The movie btw, contains about an 8 minute segment that's even worthier than Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF CHRIST flick - or perhaps that is something which that said movie is trying to emulate ... albeit uneffectively, if one would watch that flick in a objective perspective that is.Hearken, this time the sound system on the cinema where I've watched this flick is quite alright (the trickles of water on 'em frozen victims of the witch are so firkin' realistic - you could almost feel 'em really dripping), however there are certain portions wherein the prints are crumpled and creased. drat! I also find that there are actually a number of TV-adaptations from the likes of those that're produced by HALLMARKfor C.S. LEWIS' stories from the NARNIA Chronicles.In passing, I find that the White Queen Witch (played by an awesome Tilda Swinton) is one foxxy lady. No wonder Aslan gorged her.

I was back with old friends and i felt literally like a child again in that world of young fantasy were the real world literally rips away and your left in a place were anything is possible. This is just how i felt watching it. It was filmed so perfectly and acted and scripted just right that i lost myself in it and was no longer aware that i was in a cinema. My younger brother would tap my shoulder and ask me to pass the popcorn and i would turn back to the screen and get sucked back into the world. With no waiting time to get back into it.I didn't expect it to be this good. Or the director to do this well. But i was well wrong.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ	Chris Kennison	When I was a child, I remember seeing this cartoon on television and I loved it. Then I HAD to read the book and loved it too. I remember it being a catalyst for my widespread imagination and my desire to be a writer myself... along with Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.Yet, maybe I'm jaded and old, but the movie didn't meet my expectation and desire to be taken back to that imaginary rich time of my life. It was good, but I guess I wish that the makers would have taken this as seriously as the makers of Lord of the Rings took their film. This was a hugely important story to me as a child, and I felt like it was missing something. Grandeur. Largeness. Emotional impact was just okay. It needed to be respected and fleshed out in its entirety. Added to. But more importantly, the world just didn't seem as grand and amazing as it did when I read the book.To be fair though. My five-year-old daughter loved it and was actually brought to tears at the stone sacrifice scene. So, I guess I could see the emotional impact the story had on me when I was a child, through her.The movie is good and the effects are PHENOMINAL! They really are. The animals are tremendous and realistic. The wolves are scary as I remembered them. I just wish when it was all said and done that I had more of a feeling that it was better than typical.Was the movie a copy of dozens of movies from the past or are the dozens of movies from the past copies of the original book? I'm not sure. But, I just couldn't help thinking that the movie didn't really take me anywhere that I hadn't already been in movies previous to it. In fact, many scenes from the film seemed to mirror Lord of the Rings... and the ending seemed to mirror the ending of Star Wars.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie and my five-year-old loved the movie, possibly as much as I did when I was her age. But, to me, it fell short of my expectations and failed to truly capture the COMPLETE essence of Narnia. It just captured a little of it.	3.0	Chronicles tailor made for young children... but a little disappointing for an OLD FAN	2006-01-14	5	2	3

Vries ""HRH"""	"I know these Amazon reviews arent really of use to prospective buyers, but are actually used by people who have seen the movie/DVD to click ""NO"" if you don't give the title 5 stars. So I suppose this review will garner a lot of ""NO"" votes, but nevertheless, let me try to help someone out there. I have read all the Harry Potter books beforehand and saw all the movies. Loved them. Do not think too much of the acting of the children (though they do improve as years pass), but still find every Potter movie highly entertaining. Never read LOTR, but saw all three movies. Would give the first one 3 stars, the second 4 stars and the last one 5 stars. It is obvious that, because of the success of Potter and LOTR, the decision was made to film the NARNIA series. This movie will be enchanting fare for children, but if you compare it to Potter and LOTR is comes last. At the moment, that is, because I am sure the next installment will be an improvement as the director and cast grow in confidence. Sometimes the children are a bit akward and the CGI sometimes work (as with Aslan),sometimes not(as in the case of the talking Wolf). Lots of care, devotion, love and effort went into the movie, one just has to listen to the commentary tracks and watch the various ""behind- the- scenes"" featurettes to realize this. I will definitely watch the next movie in the series (Prince Caspian) and I suppose that will be the deciding factor whether this series appeals to me or not."	3.0	ENJOYABLE & CAN ONLY GET BETTER	2006-04-27	5	2	3
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1EOLRV216BXJ9	Classic Movie watcher	The first half of the story is focused on character development and may be slow to the action fanastics. But once the Pevensie siblings are united together against the witch, the movie takes a big turn to become a seemingly Lord of the Rings genre. True, there is a grippingly dark scene when the Lion sacrificed itself for Peter. Yet the major battle took place in broad daylight and was crisp, engaging, pulse beating. It maintains a kernel of hope throughout.The computer graphics succeeds in its subtlety, sophisticated and yet so real. It is an eye-opener despite the many hard-to-beat predecessors. The beavers are adorable, the lion's floating hair captivating, the flying eagles animation dazzling.What is also appealing about the movie is its beautiful landscape accompanied by a luring score - winter wonderland, snow sledge chase, green pastures that stretches far beyond, castles on high mountains.Yet what actually makes a difference are the delightfully well-chosen child actors. They display integrity and noble character, not relying on pretty faces. They are not expected to play larger-than-life heroes. Even the evil witch, young and beautiful, has defied being stereotyped and delivered a convincingly evil presence. The swordplay of the witch (two hands) are interestingly pleasing to watch - not an easy feat even for the Chinese.The plot and characters remain intact, never sidelined or dwarfed by the computer animation and special effects. For a change, the story telling and humans count more importance and preserve this classic fantasy tale.  If the Lord of the Rings is likened to a pounding orchestral piece depicting the harshness of Winter and the troughs of danger, then the Chronicles of Narnia is a delightful Beethoven that enlightens with the hope and crescents of Spring.	5.0	An upbeating fantasy of valiance wonderfully excecuted	2006-06-12	1	1	0

"Okay, we've all heard the commercials: ""extended battle scenes"" etc. etc.  In fact, that's the MAJOR ""push"" during the commercials, as to why you should buy it.....Unfortunately, the Battle SCENE (as in 1 SCENE) is only a Couple Minutes Longer!! & nothing really too exciting.  The overall picture has only been extended for a total of around 10 Minutes!... more than 1/2 of that coming at the very beginning (the bomb run, then on the train).ONLY GET THIS FOR THE SPECIAL FEATURES -- but read what's on the Special Features 1st... it's NOT a more in-depth look at the movie as some might expect.Disc 2 is the same thing that accompanies the 2-Disc Release which I bought previously.  Disc 3, is a 90 minute or so Documentary type Movie about C.S. Lewis.  Disc 4 has nothing really - just more run-off from the 2nd Disc (mostly repetative) & includes artork & other things which aren't really interesting.I got this based on the Extended Version Hype -- thinking it would be AT LEAST 30 minutes longer & more atune to the Novel -- nope, 10 minutes, if that -- and of nothing scenes which add nothing to the film (aside from the witch's bird-goblins which fight the Griffins - all of 30 seconds)... and also to see the Disc 3 movie about C.S. Lewis.... which in itself was very lackluster.The best, and really only interesting parts of it are when his Step-Son, Friends, etc. - talk about him & certain years & happenings.  But the film as a whole centers around the Narnia books - while it does intermingle the Books & his life very well -- we who know the books, already know the books; and would like to have had more time spent talking about the man... maybe it's just me.  (oh, and yes, they've been great inspiration & children's books, etc. etc. -- but also could've done without the ""children's circle"" where each child reads lines from the book)I don't know -- I was expecting a lot more, from the ""Extended"" Version especially... extra features not on the Original 2-Disc, aren't really worth it.... and the Docu.-Film about Lewis... 3.5 stars out of 5 (for a documentary).P.S.  C.S. Lewis may have been a Christian in the later years of his life... but even the Docu-Film about him clearly states he was an ATHEIST when he wrote this & SEVERAL of the others!  ATHEIST PEOPLE!  This isn't a CHRISTIAN Fantasy, Christian Movie, etc. -- He was writing about Good & Evil - Right & Wrong -- Nothing More... and to read more into it, and claim that Aslan represents so & so, and so on & so forth - is Pure Fiction."	2.0	"Don't BUY into the Hype of this ""Extended"" Version!"	2007-01-09	17	9	8
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1W3CVTOR23152	Cliff A. Satton	Honestly I don't understand all those giving this ONE star?!  I mean there are 2 or 3 or 4 stars to choose from guys.  No offense but this wasn't a rinky dink B movie or starship troopers which was terrible.  This was a well made and well acted film.Let me start out with the Kids as some expressed they weren't up to par.  Well guess what?  They are KIDS.  *Chuckles*  They aren't seasoned actors like Rachael Weisz or Tom Hanks or Brenden Frasier, Val Kilmer or Susan Sarandon etcetc.  These kids hadn't ever been in a movie like this prior.  2: That said, the kids I thought did a wonderful job.  You were quickly brought into their world of wonder and adventure.  The youngest girl I thought was actually the best of them all but they all did great jobs.And to put a stamp on that fact, my Nieces who are near Highschool age now or a year off,  cried.  Now niether wanted to even SEE the movie because they are avid Harry Potter fans.  They were sure they would hate it.  I had to drag them to see it.  In the end not only did they cry but the eldest said the movie was excellent.But anyway, the special effects were actually very good.  As there had to be a lot of digital characters I was worried about the realism of the animals and what not but the fact is, Asland *The Lion* was incredibly well done as were the wolves beavers etcetc.Now if you are not into childrens stories, then obviously you shouldn't see this, even though I think it's a great movie.  Some knocked it for being childish which is just retarded because it is a CHILDRENS book series.  Age range the books were aimed at was like 4 to 14 I'd say.  But any adult who grew up with the books and LIKED the books will enjoy this movie.Oh and for the fellow  saying it reminded him of a young version Lord of the Rings well guess what, the Author of the Chronicles and the Author of LoTR were like good friends.  Thus the similarities.So to sum up, good movie, very good action, Special effects excellent.  New Zealand Scenery absolutely beautiful.  Child actors did a wonderful job.If you want to enjoy being a kid for a day, I HIGHLY recommend this movie.	5.0	Great movie	2006-04-13	2	1	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"I've seen it before so it's not surprising when Narnia did this to me too: it gets poor reviews and it's very polarizing until I watched it and actually liked it. I remember reading the books in one setting and I actually forgot the story to practically all of them. Call it being rushed or just forgetfulness but re-experiencing the story of this one made me like the book even more since it's quite a story anyway you slice it.The Pevensie children are relocated during WW2 and they're sent to live with someone. While playing a game of hide and seek, Lucy the youngest stumbles upon a wardrobe closet. Instead of finding the back of it, she finds Narnia, a magical land with talking animals. Afterwards, she brings in her other siblings, Peter, Susan and Edmund and actually get caught up in a war: Narnians versus those loyal to the evil White Witch. And helping them out is the almighty lion Aslan.It's hard to describe Narnia(or Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter for that matter) without saying stuff like almighty, magical and whatnot but the nice thing about the film is that it doesn't over explain too much. One problem I had with Tolkien books was he explained EVERYTHING, even minor characters got backstories, even swords. Do we care how a magical land exists in a wardrobe closet? I don't so it's great that you just go along with it. There is one big of explaining on a resurrection but that's ok, didn't phase me much.Earlier this year King Kong won for Best Visual Effects which honestly I don't understand, there were composition problems all over the place like they were nearly finished but put in the finished film. Narnia has the same problem but not as extreme. Some shots are actually very well done while other shots are very funky looking(usually involving talking animals). Weta in many respects as a long way to go before they achieve quality shots. ILM has gone past the realm of ""obvious CG shots"" and Weta is catching up. The better of the 2 in the long run, I got no idea.Acting-wise some have issues with it but I found it pretty solid, especially Georgie Henley as the young Lucy. The other 3 are good but they're not really scene stealers or standouts. Tilda Swilton is of course a perfect White Witch, being over-the-top villainy and relishing in it. And just like Star Wars and Batman Begins and Kingdom of Heaven, Liam Neeson plays Aslan, the all-knowing calm teacheresque lion. Wonder if he'll ever NOT do any father figure roles in the future?It's obvious we're going to get another, and possibly the other 5(apparently Prince Caspian is next) and so far it's a pretty solid entry to the series."	5.0	Better than everyone made me think it wasn't	2006-04-06	5	4	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3AQDK1F0YQKAS	"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado"""	Finally saw 'Chronicles of Narnia' a week ago, and I'm glad to say that I was extremely impressed by it. The opening sequence which depicts one of countless air raids on England by the Nazis takes the audience into the heart of the war and effectively shows us in a brief but poignant manner how horrible war is, on several levels. For one the home of the four kids, two brothers and two sisters, and their parents is destroyed, all their memories trashed in a pile of dust and concrete. Most frighteningly, they almost lost their lives, particularly Edmund who dodges into their house while bombs are falling all around just to get a treasured picture he has of his dad, who is depicted as some type of war hero, and maybe not a hero in the traditional sense, but he's a hero to his kids nonetheless. His older brother, Peter, dashes madly in to rescue Daniel from this foolish quest, but as fortune would have it they escape by the skin of their teeth along with their sisters and mother. From this point on, the film flashes forward to a sad moment at an old English train station in which the mother is painfully saying goodbye to her little ones, in hope of whisking them away to safety in the country side, far away from the dangers that are all too close to home.Once on the train, the two sisters finally merge a little more into the picture and develop some of their traits right off the bat. Lucy is precocious and whimsical, while her older sister Susan is perhaps the most mature of the bunch, acting as the substitute mother of her siblings in place of their mom. Naturally the children are depressed because of what has happened and the current events, and on top of that being away from their mother at such a difficult time makes it that much harder for them. Once they arrive at their remote destination far out in the English country side, they trek towards their new home. On the way they are greeted by Mrs. MacReady in a somewhat cold fashion, introducing herself as the housekeeper for the professor's country estate in which they will be living in. As they finally reach the rather large mansion, the children are quickly told what they can and cannot do, as Mrs. MacReady is quite strict about what is tolerated in the professor's house. She also points out that the children must not disturb the professor, and be very quiet because she is set in her ways and doesn't like to be bothered by too much racket. Understandably the children are not too amused by this news, but at the same time they are kind of pleased to be away from danger, so they hesitantly accept the rules of their new home. Of course, children being children, their accord with the head mistress does not last very long as they quickly get into mischief with a game of hide and seek. As Peter counts to a hundred, Lucy, Edmund and Susan run around madly trying to find a good hiding spot. They all find a decent spot, including Lucy who happens to venture into a big, empty room with only one large, imposing wardrobe in the back center. Cautiously Lucy advances forward, carefully opening the wardrobe's door and then enters with her imagination running on all pistons. At first the wardrobe appears to be completely ordinary, but the further she ventures into it she quicly realizes that it's no ordinary wardrobe and that is where the film's fantastical journey finally begins.Walking through the wardrobe, Lucy falls through on the other side, ending up in a snow covered forest, with an old street lantern lighting up her path. A few minutes after getting over her initial shock and amusement, she meets an odd creature that appears to be half man, half deer. At first the intriguing creature is as afraid of Lucy as she is of it, but being her brave self, Lucy introduces herself to what she learns is a faun, and his name is Mr. Mumnus. After a brief conversation and a great deal of puzzlement on the part of Mr. Mumnus, more so than of Lucy's, he invites her into his small lodge that is hidden deep in the woods. They chat quite a bit and learn about each other, Lucy being the most inquisitive of the two and through their lengthy conversation, she befriends Mr. Mumnus. As they share a warm cup of tea in front of the fire, Mr. Mumnus lulls Lucy to sleep with a charmed tune from his flute. As she wakes up, she finds Mr. Mumnus crying, at which point she finds out that he put her to sleep because he has orders to kidnap her for the White Witch. She convinces him to not go through with the misdeed by winning over his heart through her friendship with him, and so he helps her back to her real world.Lucy hurries back through the woods and into the wardrobe, rushing to find her siblings. Much to her surprise, her brothers and sister are still playing hide and seek, and she is none the wiser. Peter finds her quickly since she is no longer hidden, as well as his sister Susan. Doing her best to explain what happened during the past several minutes, Lucy fails to convince her siblings of what had happened over the course of what was several hours for her. Edmund mocks her, while Susan and Peter simply dismiss her outrageous claim as the daydreams of a young child. This unfortunate turn of events upsets Lucy a great deal, but in the not too distant future she gets the last laugh as they are all four sent off to a magical, life changing and unfortgettable journey in what they eventually learn is the land of Narnia.Shortly thereafter, Edmund finds his way through the old wardrobe and into the wondrous land of Narnia. Haphazardly as he walks through the winter forest, he has a chance encounter with a lady known as the White Witch. She warms him up with a blanket and lures him into doing her bidding with the promises of candy that she can make with just a drop of a magical potion. Edmund promises to bring his three siblings to the witch so she can meet them, and unknowingly he betrays Mr. Tumnus as he failed to kidnap Lucy earlier. She lets him go, and he goes back through to the real world. Lucy finds out that Edmund crossed over, but he refuses to acknowledge its existence to Peter and Susan, further enfuriating Lucy.After a short while, the kids are playing cricket in the back yard and Edmund accidentally knocks the ball through a window in the professor's house. Fearing the outcome of this misfortune, they all scramble to hide from both the professor and Mrs. MacReady, and after running frantically from room to room, they finally end up in the old, dusty, large room with the huge wardrobe. Lucy convinces them all to enter, and off they escape to a world where only their imagination is the limit. Once in Narnia, they befriend a couple of beavers who takes them under their wings, or tails in this case, and tells them about the wonders as well as dangers of Narnia. One thing leads to another and before they know it, Edmund is kidnapped by the White Witch while the others are on the run from the White Witch and her evil forces, but fortunately they have some kind creatures of the forest that help them out of their predicament.After a long and challenging journey on the run from the wicked servants, Peter, Lucy and Susan meet with the legendary Aslan, the ruler of the good forces in Narnia. At this point, a greater truth is revealed to them. Daniel, Edmund, Lucy and Susan, as it turns out, were prophesized to be the rulers of the monarchy which exists in Narnia. They were destined to destroy the evil forces of the White Witch and restore order and balance to the kingdom, and that is why the White Witch has kidnapped Edmund and attempted to do the same with his siblings.From here on, epic battles are fought, there is much life lost but also gained, and friendships are forged that transcend time and space. The soundtrack is spectacular, with the songs setting the right kind of mood for a particular scene, while the musical scores engages the audience with the various battles and tense, exciting moments. Never before have I seen such awe inspiring special effects that without a doubt break the mold and set a new standard for which all others to measure up against. Aslan is especially magnificent and as close to a real lion as one could imagine. I cannot forget the cinematography which was breathtaking and really helped capture the imagination of C.S. Lewis' fantastical world filled with all sorts of creatures of both evil and good convictions. The acting was superb, especially the talent displayed by the actress who portrayed Lucy, who practically stole the show at so many moments throughout the film. During the final act of the film, I could not help but be genuinely moved to tears by the acts of courage and defiance of the army of Aslan and the four children. When Oreius the centaur wielding two swords charged through battle with no regard for his own life to save Peter from imminent death at the hands of the White Witch, he created one of the most memorable and admirable moments in movie history. Words cannot describe that kind of bravery and love, and one cannot help but have tremendous respect for such an act.The way in which the siblings helped each other out through matters of life and death, it was nothing short of deeply touching. They overcame their petty differences from the real world and realized what truly mattered to them, which was each other.This movie exceeded my expectations and went above and beyond in all aspects. From the heroes to the villains and everything and everyone in between, it was expertly crafted by the director and screen writers who managed to successfully bring to life one of the world's most treasured fantasies. It is without a doubt one of the best movies of 2005, and I'm glad to say that it is a new addition to my list of all time favorite films.	5.0	'The Chronicles of Narnia' Is Spellbinding	2006-01-09	6	4	2

If, however, one wants to know how it works as stand-alone entertainment for a non-Christian child, you would be well advised to look elsewhere.The Christian references are too obvious to be anything else, and the characters are created to be representative of a religious lesson instead of just a children's story, and it shows. The children are in many ways unlikeable and two-dimensional and the dialogue self-righteous. Tilda Swinton is riveting as a witch creepy and vicious enough to scare adults, let alone children. An older child will find both humor and adventure lacking, while a younger child will probably find all the violence frightening.	3.0	Christian entertainment	2008-07-08	6	2	4

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3SFO2GSP5CVSM	"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom"""	In truth, I've never been a big fan of such fantasies, although I knew the general plot outline for the Narnia series. I've seen all three LOTR films, including the 1970s cartoon version (which was superior to the live action version), read only The Hobbit in high school, have not read any of the Harry Potter books, but thought the first three films in that series were superior to the vastly overrated LOTR trilogy in almost every way. As for Oz, I've, of course, seen the 1939 Judy Garland film classic, but only read the first two books of the several dozen in the L. Frank Baum series. I do, recall, however, an early 1970s cartoon film of one of the later Oz books that had Liza Minelli voice Dorothy. Yet, none of these film versions, at least, equal the current film version of the first of the Narnia books: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. In fact, if the book is anywhere near as good as the film then even Lewis Carroll's mighty Alice books and Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio might have to move over as the reigning titans of children's fantasy literature. Yes, I know many J.R.R. Tolkien fans will object to the LOTR series being classified a children's fantasy, but too bad. Narnia is superior in virtually every way to LOTR, and Lewis wore the children's tag with pride.... This is the result of a good screenplay, which is very hard to do for kids, for most children's films lack that child-like wonder, as if the filmmakers have forgotten what childhood was like. Cinematographer Donald McAlpine captures that point of view in many of the child's eye shots of vistas and the whimsy on the children's faces. The only downside to the film is that, like many fantasies, you have to suspend logic. For example, why does Aslan need to wait a hundred years to bring an end to the White Witch's eternal winter? He clearly has the power to do so at any time, but `The Prophecy' has foretold that it can only occur when the four children arrive. But, this is part of the suspension of disbelief that all such tales require. The score works well, and never intrudes on the film, as it too often does in the LOTR trilogy, and the film's credits end with a terrific song by Alanis Morissette.I hope that this film does well enough that the remaining six books hit the screen, for with the amount of dreck being foisted at kids, these films will prove a nice respite. If only the Alice and Oz books are next on the film franchise conveyor belt, rather than Shrek 13 or Ice Age: Revenge Of The Neandertals. Click the heels of your ruby slippers along with me. Please.	4.0	Excellent	2008-09-19	2	1	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	"""Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen. Bear it well, Sons of Adam! Bear it well, Daughters of Eve!"" - Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeWhen it was announced that Disney had bought the rights to C.S. Lewis' Narnia series, I have to admit that I was worried. Walt Disney Studios haven't always been known to produce faithful adaptations of books (example:The Black Cauldron). But in late 2005, all of my worries were laid to rest. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was one of the most memorable films that I saw that year.The story is deceptively simple and straightforward. During the bombing of London in WWII, the four Pevensie children are sent to the idyllic countryside to stay with the mysterious Prof. Kirke. While exploring the house Lucy, the youngest, finds herself wandering into a large ornate wardrobe. To her astonishment it leads into a wintry forest where she meets a faun (a mythological figure; half-goat, half-human) named Mr. Tumnus. He invites her to his home where he lulls her to sleep with his flute. When she awakens he confesses that he had been given orders to kidnap any human children he might find and hand them over to the malevolent Queen Jadis, the White Witch. The White Witch, it is revealed, has cast a spell over all Narnia so that it is always winter, always winter but never Christmas. Mr. Tumnus helps Lucy to find her way back to the wardrobe. Lucy tells her brothers, Peter and Edmund and her sister, Susan about her amazing discovery of a land within the wardrobe. Naturally they don't believe her and what's worse they fear that she might've gone mad. But then one night Lucy goes back through the wardrobe into Narnia, unaware that Edmund has followed her. While she is visiting Mr. Tumnus, Edmund encounters the White Witch herself. The White Witch serves him enchanted food and promises to make him a prince if he can arrange a meeting between her and his other siblings. When Edmund and Lucy return, Edmund lies to Peter and Susan about where they've been. But soon all four children find themselves in Narnia. When they go to visit Mr. Tumnus they come upon his home in shambles. The White Witch has discovered his betrayal and punished him for ""fraternizing with humans"". The children are almost too frightened to go on when they meet a talking beaver named, get this... Mr. Beaver. Mr. Beaver guides them to his luxurious dam where he introduces them to his wife, Mrs. Beaver. The children are repeatedly told that, ""Aslan is on the move"". After a lengthy scene in which the beavers give a lot of story exposition about a Narnian prophecy, Peter, Susan and Lucy realize that Edmund's gone missing. He's betrayed them and gone to the castle of the White Witch. The three children and the two beavers must make their way to the Stone Table where Aslan, the Lion King of Narnia, will protect them. On their trek they face many dangers and see many wondrous things that I won't go into detail about. Needless to say the four children are reunited and prove themselves to be heroes in a climactic battle with the White Witch's forces.C.S. Lewis wroteThe Chronicles of Narniaas a Christian allegory but the books are often viewed simply as being children's fantasy, which indeed they are, but also much more. The story features talking beats, epic battles, noble sacrifice and a contagious sense of wonderment. The first film journey into Narnia is not only faithful to the book but also expands the story and characters. It may not be on the same level asThe Lord of the Ringsbut the Narnia films will still be remembered as a classic series.There are four available versions of this film on DVD, they are:Single disc edition, which includes two audio commentaries, an informative trivia track, a blooper reel and previews2-disc Collector's Edition, which includes all the features from the single disc version but also comes with a second disc loaded to the brim with cool bonuses4-disc Extended Edition, which includes all the features available in the two earlier editions plus a third disc with a biography of C.S. Lewis, and another disc of special features4-disc Extended Edition + Bookend Gift Set, which contains the 4-disc Extended Edition as well as two collectible bookends of Lucy with the wardobe and Tumnus and with the lamppostOf these four versions I would recommend the 2-disc Collector's Edition and the 4-disc Extended Edition. While the Gift Set is very nice it isn't really worth the price unless you're a diehard Narnia collector."	4.0	A Gift to the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve	2008-06-23	4	4	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	ASIA7V7CBSKD3	Cowboy on the Ocean	"It has literally been decades since I've even looked at the cover of the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series, so my review will not be based on how it relates/compares to the novels by C.S. Lewis.Over all this is a wonderful and masterful film.  The costume design and special effects may be the best I've ever seen in a movie (the special effects aren't James Bond type explosions either - i.e. Aslan looks like a real lion through out the entire movie, yet no lions were used during any of the filming).  Until ""The Lord of the Ring"" trilogy (where after the first two films you knew you had not seen the conclusion), ""Narnia"" had a beginning, a middle, and an end (which made it much better then ""LOTR"" - IMHO).There are a total of 7 books in the original ""Narnia"" series and the producers own the film rights to all seven - though I don't know if they will make that many.  Currently ""Prince Caspian"" is in production and I feel confident that they will do at least one more after that, but if there will be more then 3 movies I do not know.For those interested in the Christian symbolism, it is in the film.  From the obvious (the kids being called, ""Daughters or Eve or Sons of Adam"") to the more in-depth, such as the fact that there are 4 kids/main characters or Aslan himself.So people may not feel that this is a 5-star movie, but I believe once the others are released and the story comes out more that it will only grow and expand the excellence that is this series.I definately recommend this movie for everyone, not just for kids or families."	5.0	Excellent	2006-04-24	1	0	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is one of those rare sets of stories that are meaningful to children, teens, and adults.  However, what is especially interesting about these stories is that they mean very different things to people at different ages while retaining their ability to convey it central message to everyone.  There is a reason this set of stories has grown in popularity and reputation over the past fifty-plus years.  C. S. Lewis created his stories drawing on his rich understanding of myth, his Christian faith, and his brilliance as a writer.Kids will love the fantasy and adventure.  There will be moments of great wonder and even some of fear, but all of this great movie will delight them.  Teens will relate to the four main characters and their complete loss of control over their lives during the terrible Blitz of World War II and then having to rise to the challenges that face them in the very strange world of Narnia.  Adults will enjoy all the adventure and fantasy, but also the way ancient myths and characters are used to dress out what is basically a Christological message.Then there is the achievement of the film itself.  The visual aspects of the film are simply marvelous to behold.  It is something you will want to see many times (at least I do).  The achievement of Aslan as a character who exists only in a computer or briefly as three different models, well, that is a tour de force of the animator's art.  Having to get such a beloved and well known story into a film that can be shown at commercial length and still delight fans of the books is also an accomplishment to be proud of.The characters on the screen and the voices chosen for the animations are all spot on.  I enjoyed every performance in the film and am delighted to own this DVD to watch with my family many times.The extras on this deluxe 2 DVD edition are unbelievably rich.  You get a voice over with the director and the four children of the cast, another voice over with the director and a few of the other creative talents who helped make the movie, and another feature with pop up informational bits.  So, you can watch the movie four times and without watching it the same way twice.  Then there is also a montage of bloopers that is a bit of fun.  This is all just on the first disk.The second disk is crammed full of features that will show you what seems to be every aspect of making the film.  We get features of the director, all the principle creative talents including the producer.  Then there are features about the story C.S. Lewis created and how all the other artists had to tell that story through their individual crafts.  So much of the original story has to be interpreted to get it on the screen.  The areas where images, sounds, and effects would have been supplied by the reader's imagination have to be made explicit in a movie, and what we have been given here is amazing.There is another feature on the creating of the creatures and one on a single amazing scene and how it was put together from filming done in a half-dozen countries.  There is even a map of Narnia that the viewer can explore in 3-D computer generation.Even the case of this deluxe edition is interesting and evokes the main idea of the magical wardrobe.  It also includes a couple of postcard-sized reproductions of the concept art for the movie.I recommend this for everyone and especially families to watch and talk about together.  There is a lot in these stories and a lot to draw out of each other about what the meaning each took from the various scenes and images."	5.0	Superb movie of a wonderful and deservedly well-loved story	2006-03-31	4	4	0

Stoneham	I love the Narnia books, but I was disappointed.  not because of any plots changes or anything, but just because it could have been so much better.  I guess being a british kid doesn't mean you can act.  The acting was just horrible (especially Lucy).  It could have been saved if they had directed the movie with some dramatic sense, but it just never really got fast paced or exciting.  The entire first half of the final battle was scored with music that was underwhelming.  Perhaps most will like it, but if you're a discerning movie fan, be prepared for an underwhelming experience (and long at almost 2:30).  Still, I imagine kids will love it, which is all that matters in the end, isn't it?  :)	3.0	Thank goodness it was a free rental	2006-08-10	13	6	7
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A77184QJM3PM	"C. Tolley ""Chris Tolley"""	"This film was very eagerly awaited by many fans of the books, and fantasy fans in general. By and large, the film delivers the goods, although it teeters a bit here and there. Narnia, the magical land entered through the wardrobe, is stunningly rendered. The wonder of Narnia in winter as first glimpsed by Lucy is perfect. The White WItch is perfectly dreadful, as she was meant to be. The children, for the most part, are good as well, though a few wooden moments occur during the rather long running time. Happily, the creature effects are well-done, especially the lion, Aslan. He was the epitome of nobility and power. The battle scenes seemed just a bit sanitized, perhaps after seeing the epic battles of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, we need to be completely bowled over to be impressed anymore. Anyway, the religious element wasn't bashed over our heads, just presented as it was in the book, more symbolic than overt, which is as it was supposed to be. There were a few deviations from the book, which again is usual for a transfer to the big screen. Hollywood seems to think a book just isn't allright as it is, and must be ""doctored"" a bit for translation to film. Oh well. For the most part, the film is very happily very close to the book, and it succeeds as a film. Hopefully this means the others in the series will be as good themselves. The DVD transfer is beautiful, with excellent light and dark contrast, with bright glowing colors. The sound is great without being overbearing. I had very definite ideas in my head when I read the book as to the landscape, the characters, and especially Aslan. Thankfully, the powers that be who created this film had many of the same ideas."	4.0	Lucy Looks Into A Wardrobe...	2006-08-10	8	7	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A21B2TJBWCSK1R	Cubist	"Carefully marketed to be the next franchisable fantasy film alongside The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Harry Potter series, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe defeated Peter Jackson's over-hyped juggernaut, King Kong  at the box office in a surprise upset. The combination of a Christmas holiday release date, strong source material (C.S. Lewis' classic novel) and a family friendly take proved to be unbeatable. A sequel, not surprisingly, is in the works.The four children are all excellent and quite believable as siblings. Henley, in particular, does a good job as the adorable and precocious Lucy. Her wonderfully expressive eyes convey her emotions and play quite effectively on our sympathies. The filmmakers wisely cast unknown actors in these parts which helps transform them into their characters because we have no pre-conceived notions about them.The Chronicles of Narnia is a triumph of production design, visual effects and on pretty much every other level of technical expertise as it successfully immerses us in this magical world rich in detail and atmosphere - something that is par for the course for these kinds of films ever since The Lord of the Rings raised the bar so high. The film is also quite faithful to Lewis' novel and manages to capture the sense of wonder while maintaining the right balance of warmth, humanity and darkness. Although, children who are sensitive to seeing animals being hurt (even though faked) might not want to see this film.This film places an emphasis on the bond of family. Only when the four children are reunited and work together as a team are they victorious. Despite Edmund's transgressions, he is forgiven, welcomed back into the fold and given the chance to redeem himself - hence its universal appeal. The fact that the filmmakers did not screw up adapting a book beloved and cherished by so many is an achievement in and of itself. The Chronicles of Narnia is an entertaining and well-made fantasy epic.The two-disc special edition is jam-packed with extras that cover many aspects of the filmmaking process. But we kick things off on the first disc with ""The Bloopers of Narnia,"" an amusing collection of pratfalls, blown lines and general goofing around on the set.One also has the option to ""Discover Narnia Fun Fact"" that involves various factoids about the film to popping up on the screen as you are watching it. The only complaint of this feature is the infrequency of them. For such a book steeped in trivia (as I'm sure the film is as well) there could have been more facts appearing on screen.Also included is an audio commentary by director Andrew Adamson and actors William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley. Not surprisingly, the older kids, in particular Moseley and Popplewell, offer the most coherent comments while Adamson gamely prods them with decent questions.There is a second commentary by Adamson, production designer Roger Ford and producer Mark Johnson. This is a more technically oriented track as they talk about how WW2-era London was recreated and how Narnia was brought to life.The second disc starts off with ""Chronicles of a Director"" that takes a look at the man who directed Shrek and was subsequently put in charge of this huge epic.""The Children's Magical Journey"" focuses on the four child actors. Adamson was looking for real kids and not self-conscious child actors. They clearly had the time of their lives as evident by their tireless enthusiasm.""Evolution of an Epic"" is broken down into four featurettes. One profiles C.S. Lewis and examines the inspiration behind his Narnia books and takes a look at their enduring legacy. Various technical aspects, from the weapons and armour to the creature make-up and the costumes are examined. We see how they all contributed to bringing the novel to life. Also, a specific scene - the melting frozen river sequence - is dissected into its various technical aspects: CGI, miniatures and soundstages. The amount of work and the scale on which this film was made is very impressively conveyed in these extras. They provide a snapshot of just how much hard work was put into making Narnia.""Creatures of the World"" takes a look at the various types of creatures that inhabit the world of Narnia, from centaurs to satyrs to characters like Aslan and Tumnus. The focus is on the more technical aspects but when you click on the wardrobe icon you get the historical and literary perspective, their traits and physical attributes.""Explore Narnia"" presents an interactive map of the fantasy world. It puts key locations into their context within the story and its distinctive characteristics. This is an excellent guide.Finally, there is ""Legends in Time"" that presents a timeline of events that occur in Narnia and how they compare to time in the real world."	5.0	A wonderful adaptation of C.S.

I have watched it innumerable times: I know every scene, every second of it, every expression of each character, every look on their faces.I've read the books after watching the movie, I didn't like the books too much because they seemed too childish to me(I didn't read the books as a child).I think the movie really captures the soul and the atmosphere of Narnia. Andrew Adamson(the director) created the world of Narnia, the real Narnia, so that everyone can believe that Narnia really exists. All the actors are chosen just right: I see Lucy, Susan, Edmund and Peter in Georgie Henley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and William Moseley. Tilda Swinton, James McAvoy: there couldn't be better choice for the characters of the White Witch and Mr. Tumnus. The best voice actors were chosen as well for Mr.and Mrs. Beaver, Aslan, Fox, all the creatures.The music is incredible. It seems Harry Gregson-Williams has actually been in Narnia.After watching this movie the first time I was looking in all wardrobes and closets in the house trying to find a way to Narnia. And I believe that one day I will actually get there. The Narnia created by Andrew Adamson.I wish he would create another part of the Chronicles, ""The horse and his boy"".

My wife had read the book and knew what it was about. I didn't really know anything about it previously. It was a good movie and I'm sure as a kid I would have loved it. I just think it was lacking in a few areas. I don't know if that's due to the movie or if it was from the book. It starts out way to slow. When they get to Narnia, it's been winter for 100 years and then it starts thawing for no apparent real reason. The Lion character was disappointing and didn't seem very special to me. These young boys suddenly become daring knights seemed hoky to me. The witch acted more like just a mean woman than a witch. The movie is worth watching and if you have kids it may be worth owning. But don't expect to much.	3.0	Good but somewhat lacking	2005-12-28	4	1	3
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AILBDL6ATVDCJ	"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL"""	This movie is an excellent adaptation of C.S. Lewis's novel.  Yes, there are slight changes, but nothing that takes away from the awesome story of original work.The cast is perfect!  I have heard others complain that more famous actors should have been cast for this film.  I say nonsense.  Having not-so-famous people in the film made it an even better production.And these not-so-famous actors and actresses did the book proud!  There is not even one-second of this movie where anyone underacted overacted their parts.Georgie Henley is stupendous as Lucy Pevensie, bringing just the right mix of timidity and exuberance.  She deserves praise, and I am sure C.S. Lewis would have loved her performance.  I know I did, and I am a big fan of The Chronicles of Narnia!Skandar Keynes is remarkable as Edmund Pevensie, tackling one of the most difficult characters in the movie.  He has to play the reluctant villian in a fantasy movie that requires so much imagination.  He performed like a veteran!  I look forward to seeing this kid in more films.  He's got talent and understanding well beyond his years.William Moseley is fantastic in his role as Peter Pevensie.  The casting for this movie was virtually flawless, and Moseley's performance is proof of that.  Acting with so much of the surrounding environment and characters being computer generated can not be easy, yet Moseley seems a natural at it!  Bravo!Anna Popplewell plays Susan Pevensie, the sibling who tries to bind the rest together - almost playing mom to the rest.  She is absolutely beautiful!  Liv Tyler, but with the ability to act!  If she stays in film, she could be one of the biggest stars of all time!  Just has to do more big American films!Tilda Swinton is perfect in her role as the White Witch.  She manages to be beautiful and not-so-beautiful at the same time, which if you've read the books, is exaclty what was needed to make this film work.  I have to assume she was very familiar with The Chronicles of Narnia to make play her role to such perfection.  Once again, bravo!I shall mention only one more character in the movie.  One that really grabbed my attention right from his first scene in the movie.  James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, the Faun, is amazing.  He is exaclty as creepy, yet nice, as I expected the character to be.  I have watched the DVD (also saw the film twice in theaters) about five times now, and I really love his acting and the parts of the film where he is talking to Lucy.This movie has a little bit of everything: great one-liners, great scenery, great special effects and computer generated images.  And its message of sacrifice and love is so universally accepted, it is a film for everyone!Andrew Adamson worked hard to create a movie that C.S. Lewis fans can be so proud of!  I appreciate and applaud him for doing so!Thanks A.A.See ya next review!	5.0	Excellent!	2006-04-10	9	6	3
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A28FW6IOKQUAU	Dan	I gotta say, there have definitely been a lack of decent movies lately. It seems to be all immature teenage comedies, lousy remakes of old classics, or stupid horror films. For me, Narnia was an amazingly fresh and enjoyable movie. You probably know the plot by now, and the film stays pretty true to the book. However, the kids wanting to go back home and Aslan's attitude toward the Witch ticked me off. The cinematography, acting, costumes, and effects all come together to portray a true world. That's the highest praise I can give a film. Can't wait for the next one, and I hope Hollywood acutally starts making some more good movies someday soon. Cheers.	5.0	Great film, pretty faithful to the book.	2006-05-05	0	0	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A169I83JL8QJGN	Daniel A Moir	"I'm quite upset with [...] whose editor on their film site lead me to believe that this film would disappoint. That is not the case as long as you know what to expect. One expectation that was set by the pre-release review I read was that the special effects would not be spectacular. They're not. In fact, the CGI is so far from realistic it may have been better to do this as a computer animated feature. Nevertheless, don't let the mediocre CGI steer you away from this otherwise phenomenal film.I always had a hard time watching the original BBC versions as the special effects and puppets were absolutely abysmal, but it was still incredibly true to the book. My biggest fear with this one was that would resolve the special effects issues, but would stray from the novel so much that it would become unwatchable. My biggest fear was that they would modify the content to loose it's religious allegory in order to ""avoid offending people"". Thankfully the director was ever true to the novel, committing a few minor sins of omission, but leaving the main story, and it's metaphors in tact, and for that I am grateful. The story follows CS Lewis's novel nearly perfectly, loosing only minor details, and minor bits of dialogue, and not adding anything that would disrupt the flow of the original tale.I'm really proud of Disney for having the guts to do this film right, and having the guts to keep CS Lewis's original vision intact. Thank you.Although the CGI effects were disappointing after some of the newer fantasy films such as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, CS Lewis's classic has finally been given the definitive visual version of the tale that it has long deserved... and I can finally retire the abysmal BBC version.The acting in here is fantastic, the cinematography is artistically brilliant, and best of all Aslan is awesome. If you can only see one movie this winter, see this one. You aren't likely to regret it, as long as you don't have too high of expectations for the CGI."	4.0	Simply Amazing	2005-12-12	3	1	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	If you're going to bring a beloved classic to life, you had better do it right - and director Andrew Adamson did just that, largely because of his own special memories of reading the book as a child.  The timing for this film was also right - not only because it follows in the wake of the masterful Lord of the Rings series (and there will always be comparisons between Narnia and LOTR, despite their vast differences) but, more importantly, because this film really could not have been made any earlier.  I wasn't a big fan of CGI when the technology emerged; I thought it took away from the purity of the medium and, of course, it was oftentimes obviously not real in those early days.  When you watch The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, though, you see the undeniable magic that CGI has now opened up.  This film is heavy with computer animation, and its integration with real actors and sets is virtually seamless.  Aslan, by way of example, may well be CGI's highest achievement to date.  For one thing, he looks bloody real in every scene, but what is truly amazing is the depth of feeling and emotion that comes through in his face and gestures, particularly during the scene at the Stone Slab.There's really far more to praise about this film than I have time or room for.  I'll just say the cinematography and music are masterful, and the creation of the different creatures (be they computer-generated or wonders of costuming) are incredibly detailed and realistic.  I just want to hurry up and talk about the children playing the Pevensie siblings.  Do they give awards for best casting?  If they don't, they certainly should, and this film would take that prize hands-down.  They boys (William Moseley as Peter and Skandar Keynes as Edmund) are excellent, but the girls are nothing short of perfect.  There's just something about Anna Popplewell (Susan) that I find blissfully charming.  Her character is basically the smart and careful one of the bunch, and Popplewell just radiates nobility and a maturity beyond her years.  Young Georgie Henley, though, takes the proverbial cake as little Lucy.  I tend to think of this story as Lucy's for the most part.  It is she who first takes us into Narnia, and we see that enchanted land primarily through her eyes.  Aslan is the central character, but Lucy is really the audience's link to everything that happens.  I think you can experience Narnia just by watching Lucy - the childish wonder, the joy of the land's magic, and the heart-breaking sadness of the White Witch's most evil deeds.  If you listen to the children's commentary on the DVD, though, you'll be even more impressed with these kids.  Georgie is the quintessential child, a fountain of unbridled energy and unabashed honesty, but she also asks the director some incredibly insightful questions about some of his directorial decisions.  All of these kids are smart as a whip, but that Georgie truly is something special.I'm assuming you already know the story here, so I won't go into plot details.  What makes the story resonate so deeply is the myriad of interpretations you can take away from it.  Clearly, there's a strong Christian allegory at work here, primarily in terms of Aslan, the rightful king of Narnia, but you don't have to view the story in that way at all - although the moral implications of this classic contest between good and evil are obvious and beneficial to all.  Your interpretation, in fact, may very well change with each viewing.  Children can just enjoy it as an adventure with talking animals, but as they come back to the film over time they will begin to pick up on the deeper meanings of the story.  This is one of those rare films that gets better and better with each viewing.You have to love the bonus features on the two-disc collector's edition.  We're talking hours and hours of behind-the-scenes footage and insights into the whole Narnia experience (and a few bloopers).  I really love the Kids and Director Commentary, and I would heartily encourage you to watch that.  Filmmaker commentary (and there's one of those here, as well) tend to be rather boring.  I got more out of the Kids Commentary than I would normally get out of ten filmmaker commentaries.  You also have the option of watching the film with interesting facts about Narnia popping up from time to time.  If you really want to know how in the world this incredible movie was brought to life, you'll relish Disc 2 and its hours of interviews and film prep featurettes on the casting, design, costuming, creature-making, etc.  You can also find really nice information on the different creatures you'll meet in Narnia - and you can even explore Narnia's most important locations and hear a little more about what happens in Narnia after the story of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe ends.  The Special Two-Disc Collector's Edition of this movie is truly the complete package - and a must for Narnia fans.	5.0	A magical adaptation of an even more magical story	2006-04-03	53	50	3

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2B3FL4VV0EKGY	DanK	I just went to see this movie for the second time, and all I can say is, AMAZING!This brilliantly captures the world of Narnia, and I don't see how they could have done it better.  I have seen an old version from the 80s that was almost exactly like the book, but had some of the most horrid cinematography I had ever seen, but I loved the books anyway, so I was really excited when I heard about this movie, and I definitely was not disappointed.The actors do a very good job, especially considering how young some of them were.  Graphics are just plain superb, and they really help to make the world come to life.  Also, the score is fantastic, it fit with the film perfectly.I was really shocked as I read through some of the reviews on here however.  And I don't mean to make anyone mad here, but I really must say to all of the people who gave the movie 3 stars or less, did you watch the same movie I did?  All of the major complaints people have are completely baseless.  Ok, so it could have done without the ice floe scene, but that is really the only thing I can find wrong with it.And to the people comparing it to Lord of the Rings, you have no business doing so.  In fact, if that's all you can see in this movie, you probably don't have any business writing a review at all.  Anyone who knows anything about Narnia could tell you it is not the same story as the Lord of the Rings, and the movies reflect that.  Narnia is in no way not as good a movie because of this; in fact, that makes it a better movie than it would have been if they tried to make it like LotR.  And I don't see how there were even a few people who said it was like a shortened version of LotR.  That is the most bogus comment I have ever heard.So, to sum it all up, unless you come into the movie with a pre-disposition to not like it, you should love it and see what a masterpiece it is.Oh, and just as a side note, I saw a review saying that Christians were attacking this movie...?  I don't know where that came from, but every Christian organization I know of that has said anything about it has been strongly encouraging people to go see it.  Although everyone should go to watch it anyway, even if you aren't a Christian you will enjoy it.Happy viewing!	5.0	Amazing Work!	2005-12-16	6	4	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3DGVB3T5QJNRE	Danny G.	I have to admit, Narnia is an excellent movie that will stand the test of time! It's a true saga, like the Lord Of The Rings!What moved me most was how each of the four children & teens grew, as individuals, and as a family unit. It's so easy to be selfish and only think about one's own needs. It's refreshing to see characters not only being concerned with each others well being, but also with the the community-at-large. One, which is so incredibly alien, it takes a lot of courage to care!In the world of Narnia, these four young people have real power! Their decisions have incredible consequences! One choice is to take risks, the other to retreat into safety and comfort. The adults in the audience, I'm sure, can identify with this tug-of-war. This quandary effects us all at some point in our lives.Another theme addressed is War. The opening scene shows the bombing of London during World War 2. I knew someone who actually lived through this experience as a child. It left lifelong scars. In the very beginning we see train loads of children being evacuated to family, friends, or even benevolent strangers in the much safer countryside. I said to myself, this is what war is really about: desperation and separation. It brought tears to my eyes. If anyone had experienced what my English friend did, first hand, as a child, they would think twice before starting or supporting war, period!While a war is fought in Narnia, this one is to prevent the collapse of civilization, at the hands of evil geniuses, just like in Lord Of The Rings or World War 2. Perhaps, if that was the standard the human race could agree on to wage war, then this ancient scourge would, indeed, finally become a thing of the past!The filmmakers should be congratulated for bringing a fairly complex story to the big screen with dignity and inspiration. I'm sure C.S. Lewis would be proud!P.S. I saw this magnificent film a second time, and I'm glad I did! The feelings of elation and awe are much appreciated!

It's an excellent movie, with good values, and it's good for kids. But that doesn't mean adults can't enjoy it either.It's very emotional, and some point of the movie is bound to make you cry. The four child stars had excellent acting, which isn't something a lot of child stars can do. Georgie Henley can actually cry, which will make you cry also cause she's so cute. I have the book, but haven't gotten around to reading it yet. I've started on the first book, ""The Magician's Nephew,"" which could possibly be made into a movie too, since they say they want to do all seven of the books on film. I hear the DVD is suppose to come out in April around Easter.I went and saw it today for the third time, and I cried more this time than the other two. Of course they're a few things that weren't accurate to the book, but you can't expect a movie to be just like the book word for word. For those who complain about too much unneeded action, you have to see it from a child's point of veiw. A child won't stay quiet through a movie if it's long and dull. Maybe if you're reading a book you can be patient, but not while watching a movie.It's an escape from reality, and I like it more than Lord of the Rings, which is my favorite movie.The characters are what I expected, and way better than those BBC versions from the old versions made for PBS. They're all very likable, even Edmund, who betrays his family. I actually felt bad for him, where as in the PBS version all I wanted to do was strangle him cause he was so annoying. And James McAvoy as Tumnus is a lovable creature, who I also felt very bad for after he got captured.I don't think the special FX were THAT bad. Aslan looked pretty real, and the battle sequence was very well done, without showing blood. A lot of kids were afraid of the White Witch at the theater though. But everyone clapped after the movie ended, and it's pretty obvious why. This is such a good movie, and something different from the weird movies that are coming out nowadays. Even if you haven't read the book, or even heard of it, go see it anyway. Give it a chance. This is a movie that will be remembered for a long time, and outlast whatever is currently in theaters."	5.0	Too Awesome!	2005-12-26	3	2	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	ADVX0P3EIKWBK	Darth Wader	I actually watched The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and then I decided to read it.  I have to say that this is a mostly faithful adaptation (as they cannot do everything in the book.  I thought the things that they added or deleted did not take away from the overall story and even made it more visually effective).  What I notice most is that the scenery is gorgeous and definitely seems to be what is described by C.S. Lewis.  The 4 kid actors do a terrific job (Edmund was great at being the brat!  Peter was annoying, though, but that's ok because he was pretty annoying in the book as well).  I also thought that Liam Neeson was a perfect fit for the voice of Aslan and that Tilda Swinson captured the essence of the White Witch (kind of looked like Cate Blanchett in Lord of the Rings).  One of the great things with this movie (as well as Lord of the Rings) is that it has awesome special effects AND a great story line.  I hope that all 7 will be made into movies and judging by how much money it made in the box office, I am sure that it will.  Overall, this movie was well acted, the story was very cohesive, the talking animals were great, and the special effects were great.  Narnia became alive and this movie and I hope it is here to stay.	5.0	A Mostly Faithful Adaptation of a Great Book	2006-06-12	0	0	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2MW0RYIXMEYGS	Dave	"Through some sweet connections (or a fluke), I was able to attend a pre-screening of the film. Having tracked the film's progression for `only' the past three years, it was definitely a highlight of the month. Dressed in chain mail fabric facsimile, a fine royal red tunic with the rampant yellow lion emblem on the front, and a cloak (left over from Return of the King) wrapped about my shoulders for warmth, I joined my sister (dressed as the White Witch), brother and friend in walking in to the theater.But you don't care what I was wearing or who I went with; you want to know about the FILM.You almost certainly know the basics by now. Four children are sent away to the countryside during the air raids, to the house of an old professor. There, Lucy (the youngest, portrayed by Georgie Henley) finds a magic wardrobe which ushers her into a wonderful, wintry country. She meets Mr. Tumnus, a faun (half-man, half-goat, superbly portrayed by James McAvoy), and learns about the country and its cruel ruler, the White Witch. The scenes are carried off delightfully. If one can use the term ""chemistry"" without signaling thoughts of love or romance, then that is the fitting word. Tumnus is enlisted to watch for humans and deliver them to the witch, but helps her escape instead. Lucy returns to find that no time has passed - and that no one believes her.Edmund (portrayed by Skandar Keynes), the brat of the family, mocks her until he too stumbles after her into the wardrobe. He meets the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), and upon returning from Narnia, spites Lucy by insisting there is no such place. But their two older siblings, Peter (William Mosley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) are soon brought into Narnia with them, where they learn that their coming has been prophesied for ages, and that they are destined to be entangled in the very thing they were sent away from; war. Edmund slips away to the White Witch, with betrayal in mind, and the other three children must flee the White Witch's wolf-minions. Aided by the beavers (Ray Winstone, Dawn French), they meet the somewhat messianic lion king Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) and must contend with Edmund's treachery, and the armies of the White Witch.POSITIVE: This is truly an excellent film. Obviously, someone who dresses up in costume won't be exiting the theater thinking it stunk, but it really was. The roles of C.S. Lewis's literary creations come to life splendidly in all four of the children, in the good and bad creatures, and in the snowy landscapes. The creatures for good are wonderfully performed, particularly in Orieus (Patrick Kake) the centaur (half-human, half-horse) who was an excellent hero role, and got too little screen time in my opinion. The White Witch is carried out magnificently by Tilda Swinton. When we first meet her, she is enchanting and charming towards Edmund, a perfect mother-figure. But her presence as the epicenter of evil in Narnia is entirely convincing as well.The battle scenes are edge-of-your-seat action, yet not too heavy or dark as some have contended scenes from the `Rings' trilogy were. No blood, but that doesn't mean no violence. (Obviously, no profanity or sexual content of any sort)Most know how the story will turn out, but the best part of the film is the little moments, the execution and screenplay while carrying out the plot, that make it all so much better.NEGATIVES: Don't go into this film with Lord of the Rings in mind. In accordance with the BOOK, the movie succeeds and excels in its performance. But it does not rival the scope of Lord of the Rings. It is not meant to. I was fighting to remove Lord of the Rings from my repertoire so I could take the film in by itself. If you look to Narnia to outperform Lord of the Rings, you will be disappointed.Also, you must know that the story of Narnia has been personalized in so many different ways, ways that director Andrew Adamson could not possibly live up to. Lewis painted with strokes broad enough to leave much to the imagination. Thus, while YOUR mental image of Tumnus may not match the one on the screen, the one on the screen works just as well, or better. So you may be telling yourself ""that's not how I pictured Tumnus, but...I like it!""Along those same lines, let's talk about Aslan. Aslan is an exceptional character in the book, whether you accept the concept of his deity or not. You can connect with him in the book. To put it another way, you get the ""warm fuzzy."" Yet in the film, nothing seems to distinguish him from all the other talking creatures. Even the music (composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, and magnificently done in almost all other aspects) doesn't truly hype the Aslan scenes up enough to know ""this is not just an `ordinary' talking lion."" Even his stature, that of an ordinary lion, makes him look UP into the eyes of the four children, and that doesn't seem fitting.I'm sure it's difficult to live up to the imaginings of a God-like lion, so we can forgive the filmmakers. In all other aspects, the film meets and surpasses expectations. Just be aware of some things not to expect when you walk into the theater.CAN KIDS SEE IT?: If your kids saw Harry Potter, then yes. Otherwise, there are evil creatures likeunto Lord of the Rings which might frighten younger viewers.SUMMING UP: This movie won't take the place of your imagination, the books, or the two combined. But like Lord of the Rings, it now provides us another window into the world of Narnia. Not the same as Lewis gave us, but another. It allows us to see things from a different perspective, new and fresh. I give this movie a resounding ten stars out of ten."	5.0	Wonderful. Fantastic. Amazing. Incredible.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY	"David A. Dein ""passafist"""	"There is one scene in Andrew Adamson's new film THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, that for me walking into the theater that needed to be perfect. If not the whole movie and (the continued franchise of sequels) would fall flat on its face. If the film did not capture this scene I believe the heart and soul of C.S. Lewis and his magical world would have been completely destroyed.But I digress!Walking into Narnia is an interesting experience for me. In all honesty I find C.S. Lewis to be a great writer that I can hardly read. His books are hailed left and right and I just can't read them. It's not Lewis's fault. I realize it's my own media saturated thick head that blocks me up. So a few weeks ago after a screening of a 10 minute super trailer for NARNIA I decided to dust off my old copy of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and decided to give it a chance. I read the first two books in about a week and I wondered to myself. What was my problem? What took me so long to become enchanted by this mystical world? I've come to realize I cannot appreciate the classics. I really think that's my loss and something I intend to work on in the new year.So anyway, sitting down in the movie theater I psyched myself up I intended to be wowed. I wanted Narnia to come alive onscreen like it did in my mind and I think it fell a little short of my expectations but in the end made me smile.NARNIA tells the story of four children. When the youngest named Lucy (Georgie Henley) finds a magic wardrobe that transports her into the magical land of Narnia. Narnia is a land of talking animals, magical fauns, and the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton) whose enslaved the land causing it to be forever winter and never Christmas. Her sister Susan (Anna Popplewell), and brothers Peter (William Moseley), and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) don't believe her story. Until the day all the children enter the Land of Narnia. A land and get caught up in a war that may fulfill a prophecy that will bring peace to Narnia.NARNIA is a fascinating example of a film that doesn't exactly add up but in the end is satisfying. The screenplay is riddled with the problems from the very beginning. It tries so hard to stick to the book that the early moments of the film feel flat. Even when the children get to Narnia you feel the same way. Narnia feels just like the British Country side the children have come from. Narnia should feel different and it doesn't. Why is their a light post growing in the middle of the forest? Why are the animals talking? Why is it always winter and yet never Christmas? These questions should inspire awe. NARNIA should glow and jump off the screen, but the first act is to busy getting from point a to point b than to allow us to immerse ourselves in the NARNIAN landscape. If your like me you'll find yourself thinking ""why does this feel like a third rate LORD OF THE RINGS?""I think what's missing is the thing that made the novel so enchanting. It's Lewis's self aware narration. Even when at the greatest peril it was Lewis's kind words and silly aside comments that lightened the situation. Admittedly that would be difficult in a film but It would have been nice if they'd tried. Instead they stuck humor in places that seemed out of place.But fear not, all is not lost. Because if you can get through the first hour (which really isn't that bad). You'll come out on the other side and into a much better and powerful movie. Once Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) the Mighty Lion comes on the screen you're in for the ride of your life.I mentioned earlier there is one scene that needed to be perfect or the film would be destroyed. That scene involves Aslan and the stone table. They got it right, and oh boy was I impressed. If Aslan is not strong, if Aslan is not seen as a threat even as he is being tormented this scene falls apart. But Adamson and his team make Aslan a character to be reckoned with. If you don't gasp as Aslan climbs those stairs and the beasts and the White Witch part the way for him, if you don't feel the pain and anguish of Aslan's torment, and if your tear ducts don't well up when the scene is over, I would doubt your humanity ( just a little.)After that the film only gets better, there is an awesome battle sequence, and even Narnia begins to take a life of its own. It gives each character their moment to shine and it wraps itself up neatly enough. After the film was over I can't wait for PRINCE CASPIAN (or THE HORSE AND HIS BOY) to hit the big screen.I would also like to single out little Georgie Henley (watch out Dakota Fanning) the little girl who plays Lucy. She gives the early part of the film a lot more life and fills the screen like very few child actors can. This little girl (in her debut role) has an innocence and yet a maturity that belies her age. This little girl gives a performance that should really net her an Oscar nod. It probably won't but if I didn't bring it up who would?While this film has a few rough spots and a first act that needed some work THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is an enchanting journey that is worth the price of admission.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AUEHG0DB54B7K	David A. Wend	I did not know very much about The Chronicles of Narnia before seeing the film, just the basic thread of the story.  So what I knew of the film and the story I had seen in trailers and a single review that I read.  I found the film to be an extraordinary adventure.  I must confess that not knowing the books when I first saw the trailers I was not at all sure I wanted to see the film.  Seeing is believing, however, and I am hopeful that more of the Narnia books might be filmed.First off, the casting of the film was excellent, particularly the roles of Peter, Edmond, Susan and Lucy.  Also, James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus was really excellent and made a perfect faun.  Perhaps the real stars are the people who produce the CGI effects with Aslan being the star in that area of production.  Voiced by Liam Neeson, Aslan truly comes alive as the noble and self-sacrificing leader that he is.  C. S. Lewis would be impressed, I think, on how well his book has been brought to the screen.  Without CGI Narnia would not be half as spectacular.  There are so many different creatures in Narnia that it was hard to single them all out.The violence of the battle has been commented upon by other reviewers and I agree with those who did not find the scene troubling.  There is less violence than The Lord of the Rings and care was taken to make it as bloodless as possible.  Even the death of the White Witch is off camera.  Certainly, the death of Aslan is a bit of a shock but one has the feeling that something will intervene and bring Aslan back.  The touching concern of Susan and Lucy seems to guarantee that this is not the end.The Chronicles of Narnia is a memorable film that I will recall with pleasure and scenes like the White Witch's first appearance in her sleigh drawn by white reindeer with be etched in my memory.	5.0	A Fabulous Film	2005-12-12	5	3	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	CS Lewis's story of the four Pevensie children's (Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, and Anna Popplewell) adventures in the land of Narnia comes to the screen as a big-budget, digital spectacle.  Although the battle, which was summarized in only a few bloodless paragraphs of the novel, takes up a good part of the running time--and, no doubt, the budget--of the film, the tone of the book is largely preserved.  The children are perfectly cast and Narnia portrayed as a generally friendly place, except for occasional appearances by the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and her cronies.  I like big battle scenes, so the shift of emphasis to spectacle from character didn't bother me, but strict admirers of the novel may be disappointed.	4.0	Looks like the beginning of another successful franchise	2006-06-20	2	1	1

Knapp ""David"""	"The content of the movie is gone over in a number of the reviews, so I will just give my opinions of the movie in general and leave the telling of the story to others.I saw this movie shortly after its release and enjoyed it immensely.  I have read the books and listened to them on audiotape again recently, and yes, I enjoy the series.  One thing that should be mentioned is that the Narnia series was written for children (my wife tells me I'm just a big kid!) and therefore the fantasy tale will stretch the imagination of adults (we are always looking for reality - hardly the point of a children's fantasy movie.)  There are things better explained in the book, but then to put them in the movie would have people complaining the movie was too long.With a couple of exceptions, I thought the special effects were fantastic.  I can see why some would compare this to the ""Lord of the Rings"" series, but I'm not sure that is a fair comparison.  While I think Narnia was well done, the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies are unlikely to be surpassed for quite some time, and Narnia does not do that.  However, I felt it did do an excellent job on C. S. Lewis' classic tale.There is violence in the Narnia series, but nowhere near the amount in the ""Ring"" series, and the way it is done seems to be designed to keep this a children's movie.  I'm glad - there is plenty of gratuitous violence in Hollywood, and this movie doesn't need it.  I also felt that the characters with the witch seemed more completely evil than I imagined them from the book (almost like they were trying to mimic the Orcs from the ""Ring"" series), but that is a minor quibble, or just a matter of opinion.  All in all, I came away refreshed after seeing this movie.Just a quick side note - I also enjoyed the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies and consider them some of the best movies of all time, but they are designed for a different audience.  My comments comparing ""Narnia"" to that movie are with the fact that ""Narnia"" was designed for children kept in mind.  While there were many children at the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, I personally wouldn't recommend them for children.I suppose it would be correct to say that this movie isn't for everyone - just read some of the reviews - but I believe it is a safe movie to take your kids too.  Most people I talked to seemed to enjoy it, and you might even find that you do as well.  I look forward to its release on DVD."	5.0	A thoroughly entertaining family movie.	2006-02-12	5	4	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A31A9GENAJYD64	David M. Rossi	When I heard that a new big screen adaptation of the lion the witch and the wardrobe was going to hit the big screen I was excited. Then I heard it was a Disney venture. My heart stopped leaping. Still, as an avid fan of the chronicles, I had to go and see this incredible looking (in trailers) spectacle. Largely, I was very pleased. I loved the acting, the effects and especially the characters such as the beavers and other creatures who were made so real, they could almost steal the movie unto themselves. What upset me a bit was the black and white structure of the good versus evil base of the movie. Sure that is there in the book and other iterations brought to life through the BBC and others through the years, But ultimately, it is so much more colorful a tale than what was portrayed here. There is no need to dumb down the story to appeal to more audiences and this is the one big gripe I have about epic novels of this sort being made into films. It doesn't have to be this way, and that has been made so apparent with the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Overall however, I have to say that this version of the classic CS Lewis novel is a spectacle of grand proportions mostly done right, unlike the usual fare of the Disney drivel. If you are a fan of the books, by all means see this adaptation but if you want the true feel of the book, see the BBC version or other versions in addition to this one. Sure the effects aren't as good, but they should only be second fiddle to such an amazing story anyway.	4.0	well done but needs a little more work	2006-04-18	2	1	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3UUGZRTBS81YN	David W. Jones	This review is about the blu-ray transfer and not the film itself (everything that needs to be said about the latter has already been said).I was generally pleased with the quality of the transfer.  Regarding the audio, Aslan's voice (Liam Neeson) resonates deeply; battle sounds clash viscerally; the musical score is clear.  As for the visuals, daytime shots are crisp and detailed.  Colors pop.  While some of the special effects are not quite to the level of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, they are still quite good, and this blu-ray lets us see them in sharp detail.  Lowlight shots were more problematic, however.  While there was not much film grain, there were a few evening scenes where the lighting would alternate from shot to shot, sometimes lighter, sometimes darker.  I have never seen anything quite like that on a blu-ray before.  It was not terribly annoying, but it did draw attention to itself and pull you out of the fictive dream for a moment.With this quibble aside, I highly recommend this movie for viewers of all ages.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.	4.0	Clean Transfer to Blu-Ray	2012-11-30	2	2	0

Not having been a youthful (or otherwise) reader of the books, I can't judge the film from that perspective, but I agree that Lucy was perfect--what a wonderful young actress.With all the discussion about the story being a Christian fable, it was pretty easy to predict the plot. The many reminders I saw from other movies and stories made me sense how interwoven the world of children's stories is--C.S. Lewis doesn't owe anything to the Lion King, but Disney owed a lot of Mustafa to Lewis and Aslan. I half expected Aslan to explain the Circle of Life to the children. The beginning reminded me a lot of Lemony Snicket.I spotted one glitch regarding Father Christmas, or whoever the gift-bearing gentleman was. Later in the movie one of the children refers to the ""man in the red suit""--as we remembered the scene, the man was dressed in brown, not red.Overall, Narnia was a two-star movie for me--too dominated by computer-generated special effects, and too heavy-handed in the triumph-of-good-over-evil story.

Well, that's easy, i just did. This fantasy film was lame. The acting was horrible by everyone except the character of Lucy. The freaky half-man, half faun, Mr. Tumnus looked more like a, well... Let's just say the whole scene where he takes young Lucy to his home was unnerving. The props were pathetic, especially the whole scene when the kids are riding the ice along the FAKE river. Also, the length of the film was way too long. Just because a film is fantasy or epic doesn't mean you have to make it long. Good lengthy movies are the ones that actually don't feel lengthy. such as LOTR or Gladiator. Although this movie is being billed as similar to LOTR, i find no resemblance to the excellence Peter Jackson achieved. Instead i find a too-light-hearted tale of salvation (kind of) which was poorly told, thus confusing the viewers. If i had never read the books, i would've said it was the love of the two girls that brought Aslan back to life which is not the case of the Christian faith that this movie ""supposedly"" parallels. Just because someone comes back to life doesn't mean they're an example of Jesus saving the world. That reminds me, Neo is not the Christ. Gawd people!!! Anyways, this movie sucks & well, it should've never been made by atheistic Disney. I'm sure they're secretly laughing at Christians who jumped at promoting this fantasy movie but boycott other fantasy movies."	2.0	The Chronicles of Lameness	2007-11-23	11	2	9

It's the story of four siblings from London who are sent (along with thousands of other English children) to live in the country, away from the Blitzkrieg bombing of Hitler's Third Reich.  The movie, therefore, opens not like a LORD OF THE RINGS fantasy film but more along the lines of BATTLE OF BRITAIN.  The children were all perfectly cast, especially Edmund and Lucy.  Aslan is just as grand and glorious as I ever imagined him to be in the books.While staying in an enormous country house belonging to an old, mysterious professor, the youngest child discovers another world via a wardrobe where all four children are caught up in a mystical war, where they are believed by the good guys to be long-prophecied kings and queens who will reign and restore freedom and order.  It is also a land where a noble Lion named Aslan lives.  Aslan is often alluded to as the Christ-figure in the seven Narnia books.Overall, this movie is pure enchantment just like the books, and since it is a Disney film, just like the old-school Disney films (e.g. the ones that were made under Walt Disney's personal supervision).This film contains no profanity (and no blasphemy), no sexual immorality, and not even any gratuitous violence.  It's just great entertainment with creative storytelling and quality production as its foundation.  If you're a C.S. Lewis fan or you're just looking for some exciting and wholesome family entertainment that adults and children can enjoy together then you can trust THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE.	5.0	Here's a good movie you can watch with your whole family.	2008-12-04	0	0	0

I had tears in my eyes several times in this movie. It was so touching and great. Was it because I am a Christian? Yes definitely. I did not need the book to understand this movie. It is beyond words. To me, I can't wait for the DVD. I am also going to see this again in the theaters. My 17 year old daughter saw it with me and my 18 year old and The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe is now there favorite movie of all time.  Even passing the Lord of the Rings!They just understand it better and are more child like in their understanding. I can't really explain it, But I can't get enough of this movie. It is the best! No Blood! No bad language, just a great story that was well presented.Go see it!By The Way, There seems to be a lot of reference to Disney like, Disney did this and Disney did that!People, Disney had absolutely nothing to do with this movie being made. They paid for advertising and released and distributed it. It was made by Walden Media. Controlled by C.S. Lewis's stepson to be faithful to the book. C.S. Lewis's grandson is satisfied with the movie. If Disney had made this, the Christian allegory would have been toned way down and then The movie would not have been made.

Hinson	Walt Disney did I wonderful job of the Pirates of the Carribean series when it was brought to Blu-Ray.  They were released as a 2-Disc Special Edition with pretty worth-wild pakaging and features. However, with the The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe on Blu-Ray, it just didn't happen.  Why would you shell out good money for something like this when the 4-Disc extended edition on DVD has so much more to offer.  Granted you have the superior image and sound quality, but I would expect at least a 2-Disc edition with features of the 4-Disc DVD.It releases like this that make me question if the Blu-Ray version has anything to offer for the money.

I almost bought this DVD set thinking it was a book because it is listed under books and says hardcover next to the title. Then I noticed the cover said Disney and Walden media (or something similar, I don't remember the exact wording) presents . . . a four disc set. So then I thought maybe it's an audio book.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1Z61THJDTJNIK	Dizzy Miss Lizzy	"I saw this movie when it came out in December and was completely blown away. I mean, the book was great, the made-for-TV cartoon movie was OK...but this was INCREDIBLE!First, there was Georgie Henley, who played Lucy. Not only was she just plain cute, she was great as an actress! Some of her crying scenes were incredibly believable...like when Lucy & Susan go into the witch's castle and see Mr. Tumnus as a statue. Well, I'm kind of known in the family for being the one who cries at movies (heck, I cried the first time I saw ""Lilo & Stitch""!), but after everyone had been crying over the big ""sacrifice-and-resurrection"" scene, what was I doing? Watching Georgie crying over the faun statue and crying because she was crying and...well, you get the picture. She's GOOD, I'm not kidding!Skandar Keynes (Edmund) was another great actor. Before seeing the movie, I re-read the book and when I realized that they'd have to do the thing where Edmund's injured, I thought, ""Well, that'll be interesting."" I was wrong. It wasn't interesting, it was downright amazing. And if you listen to the commentary on the DVD, the director says that he never thought that Skandar would cry. Well, Skandar cried all right, and I'm sitting there thinking, ""How'd they do this? These kids are AMAZING!"" I laughed pretty hard at the Turkish Delight scene---it doesn't really get much cuter than seeing a woman trying to convince a kid to get his siblings to go to Narnia, while the kid's just sitting there, stuffing himslef with junk food and insisting that he's the special one! (A little bit of useless trivia here: Skandar had to eat about 35 pieces of that stuff during filming! Yikes!)The other two kids, Anna Popplewell (Susan) and William Moseley (Peter) were good, too, but I really thought that the two younger ones did a better job acting.The adults were excellent. I think that Tilda Swinton made a great witch, and I'm glad that the filmmakers didn't go with the classic ""witch"" look---black and green, stringy hair, you know---and did it the way that they did. The extras like the ogres, minotaurs, and centaurs were very fun to watch. James McAvoy and Georgie Henley shared that perfect Lucy-Tumus chemistry. Their reaction in the first Narnia scene was pretty much real: I think that was the first time they saw each other in full costume. I know that it was the first time they saw the Narnia set.And that's just the movie! The stuff behind the scenes is even funnier! Like the bloopers reel: in just about ten minutes, you get to see Skandar lock himself in the wardrobe, the minotaur trip on the battlefield, the prop man break something on the model of Aslan, and Georgie forgetting her lines.Same thing with the audio commentary. I loved hearing about the on-set ""potty mouth bucket"" and how the kids had to keep changing clothes for about a week because of inconsistent weather.Overall: five stars. I'd give it 100 if I could but I can't because Amazon only lets you rate up to five.Get the DVD. You won't be disappointed---I hope.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3CN9CCJUNIPKT	DJ Joe Sixpack	"I grew up with the Narnia books, and read them all... I didn't have high hopes for the film adaptation, but thought it would be somewhat engaging and might rekindle some of my pre-teen passion for the C. S. Lewis canon.No such luck.This film was a failure on pretty much every level... Far more disappointing than I could have imagined.  The main problem was the lack of any sharp narrative or dramatic ooompf: this was one of the most flatly directed, downright dull ""blockbuster"" films I've ever seen.  Not much thought or finesse seems to have gone into directing the actors -- not their fault, I think, but their work is poorly framed.  The script is truncated and perfunctory -- none of the scenes or the exposition adds a sense of urgency or immediacy... I found that I simply didn't care about any of the characters... They were all just there to hit their marks, punch out on the clock, and head home when the film was done.  The special effects lacked magic -- shouldn't Aslan the Lion/Savior have been haloed and seraphic when we first see him?  Apparently not: he just strides on screen and starts leading his army.  No one even gasps or holds their breath in his presence, and the producers seem to have seen fit to leave out all the explanatory ""this was a good land until evil came and froze the heart of Narnia"" backstory... So, um, if you don't explain anything, why are we expected to care?Likewise, the incidental music was rather bland and monochromatic, a mild orchestral overlay that varied little from scene to scene... When we first meet the evil queen, the music just tootles innocuously in the background, with nary a note of menace as she enchants and ensnares poor, young Edmund... Then it keeps tootling innocuously for the rest of the film, rising up to blare a bit every now and then, yet the score is never more than functional, the same as the rest of the film.  Maybe they were trying to keep everything ""simple"" or ""not scary"" in order to tailor the film to younger viewers... But the lack of magic or any kind of emotional core permeates the film: it's hard to imagine viewers of any age caring much about what happens onscreen.Anyway, for those of you who do like this film, I'm happy for you... But many of us were sorely, sorely disappointed.  Such a big opportunity, so poorly realized."	2.0	Boy, was this disappointing...	2006-06-10	11	6	5

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3PGGPL7FM9F81	Docendo Discimus	"This 127-minute live-action version of Clive Staples Lewis' classic fairy tale is colourful and impressive, and the young actors and actresses perform very well. At 32 I would have liked a bit more grit and realism, perhaps, but Lewis wasn't Tolkien, and this is a children's story first and (I suppose) foremost. Most of the casualties are monsters of some kind, and there is very little blood - even on just-used swords, which annoyed me a little. But these details changes do less to make the film unsuitable to adults, and more to simply invite children to join its viewership, and from the viewpoint of a European, at least, ""The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe"" is a wonderful fairy tale for anyone from the age of eight or there about. Some scenes are certainly frightening, but the overall tone is far less dark than, say, ""The Lord Of The Rings"".Tilda Swinton is radiant and charismatic as Jadis, the White Witch, and Liam Neeson voices Aslan the Lion with warmth and just the right amount of otherwordly dignity. Little Georgie Henley (Lucy Pevensie) displays more acting chops at nine than many highly-paid actresses at thirty, and Scotsman James MacAvoy is a charming and quite British Mr Tumnus.The Christian subtext has perhaps been toned down a little here and there, but it is still very palpable, especially in the...well, in one particular scene. If you are on of the two or three hundred people in the English-speaking who don't know the story, I'm not going to ruin it for you.If I am to complain a little bit (and I am), I'll say that certain scenes feel a bit rushed, like Lucy's meeting with the faun and Edmund's first encounter with the White Witch. This is one movie which could have used that extra half-hour of playing time that so many movies get for no good reason whatsoever. But the overall impression? Great stuff. Touching, thrilling, charming, and not as Disneyfied as I had feared."	4.0	****1/2. Rich, visually impressive and occationally quite poignant	2006-05-06	0	0	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A38UHOCEKSUOSP	"dominion_ruler ""Bryan"""	The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is based from the first Book in the Chronicle of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis.  The book was actually required reading in my elementary school, so I was already quite familiar with the story.  There was an animated film created years ago, but it was very uninspiring, and I believe it to have been a direct to video release.  I was more than ecstatic when I learned the a real movie was coming to theatres, and the previews looked tremendous.  It was enough to assure that this was going to be big.  Epic big, as in The Lord of The Rings traditional sense.  The movie did not let me down.  It started out a little slow, but by time the climax approached, something triggered all kinds of positive emotions within.  This is a powerful tale, and perhaps even more powerfully transfered to the big screen.There are two ways of looking at this film.  One, is for pure entertainment.  The second, is on a religious perspective.  C.S. Lewis has been known for being a Christian author, and fascinated with placing religious events into fantasy lands.  It is very evident that this movie has those influences, and any watcher will pick up on the Biblical references throughout the story.  I actually chose option three, and that was watching it both for entertainment and for its content, and in the end, I felt I had watched something very satisfying and very complete.Happiness, excitement, despair, hope, and even war.  They are all in this film, and there are all well felt.  Its not just the story alone that shares practically all forms of emotion and character, and not even the characters in the film too, but the cinematography, directing, and musical score add so much to complete the tone.  The camera gives us plenty of wonderful sweeping shots of the landscape, which begins as winter in Narnia and eventually shoots into spring.  The score, is worth purchasing on cd.  Every scene of music fits so well and is so neat with what is going on in Narnia.  Then you have the final climatic showdown, where the good vs evil armies fight in war.  The score is both energetic and iluminating, getting you pumped to cheer on the good guys (or bad, if you wish).Perhaps one of the coolest things about the film are some of the effects, and more specifically, the way the creatures are used.  This isn't like Lord of The Rings where you got some elves and orcs - you generally have a mix of hundreds of creatures and animals in Narnia.  Bears, tigers, bulls, oxen, and wolves are just a few that shine, and all clash in the final battle.Another wonderful thing about this film is it is well suited for people of all ages.  If it weren't for the big battle in the end, this would easily have been a G rated film.  Though the fights go on for maybe a total of 10 minutes, there is no blood and the camera does a smooth job of skipping the details of swords piercing through bodies.Overall, this is a wonderful film that would make most feel really good when walking away.  Though most people will clearly see the religious refernces, there is great entertainment value in this too.Acting - 4Action - 4.5Characters - 5Story - 4.5Overall - 4.5	5.0	[4.5] A beautiful tale created into an epic film	2007-12-24	3	1	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1VX6VPXNQTNUP	Dr. Richard G. Petty	Like most children growing up in England, I was enchanted by the Chronicles of Narnia, and with the Second World War still fresh in most peoples' minds, was soon exposed to the context and allegory of the tales.C.S. Lewis was one of the early members of the Inklings, a literary discussion group associated with the University of Oxford. Though most of its meetings took place in Magdalen College, there is also an old pub in Oxford called the Eagle and Child that still had a small display of memorabilia of the Inklings the last time that I was there. Apart from Lewis, other members included J.R.R. Tolkien, the philosopher and anthroposophist Owen Barfield, and Neville Coghill, who produced the modern version of the Canterbury Tales, and many other literary greats. There was a strong Christian thread running through the group, and enormous cross-pollination between these talented people. Their meetings took place between the late 1930s and the 1950s. So the Second World War - widely perceived at the time as the ultimate battle between good and evil, freedom and tyranny - colored much of the work of the Inklings. It is helpful to know that to understand the context of both the Lord of the Rings and Narnia.Until the advent of the Lord of the Rings, I had usually made it a point to miss filmed version of books, since they usually had to be butchered to fit into the 2-3 hour format. I would probably have missed this one, had it not been the featured movie on a recent flight, and I had finished the books that I had taken with me. It was so good that I have since watched it again.Yes, there is much that is missing. But a film of a book really shouldn't just be a visual rendering of the original: it needs the creativity and interpretations of the screenwriter, director and actors. It is also the first of the seven books that constitute the Chronicles. The cinematography is stunning and the child actors remarkable. As a former fencer, I thought it smart that the director didn't try to turn Peter into a master swordsman. He held and used his sword like a clumsy knife, which is exactly what an unschooled child would do. There were one or two strange things towards the end, when the children forget all about their parents to accept their crowns and play in Narnia. However great the prize, that does not ring true. But this is a minor quibble.I have always enjoyed books and films that transmit subtle positive messages, without the need for declaring them ahead of time. So this is indeed a fine movie for children old enough not to be upset by the violence, and it contains enough metaphor and allegory for all but the most hardened cynic.	5.0	A Subtle Teaching Hidden Within a Well-Filmed Adventure	2006-04-23	1	0	1

Nothing against Lord of the Rings, it was a wonderful movie; but the story of Chronicles of Narnia is totally unlike the Lord of the Rings, and it cannot be made to fit that mold.Enter Andrew Adamson, director of Shrek, probably one of the greatest out of the box directors.  Andrew Adamson totally re-spun the film, this time with a PG rating.  In this film he focused on the charm and fantasy, what was largely what C. S. Lewis intended to be the stuff of Narnia.  The movie was full of intelligent but laugh-out loud humor; the colors were rich; the scenery was gorgeous; Narnia as a world felt far more real than the Lord of the Rings.Now, the downfalls.  Sadly, there were because of the PG (only) rating there was only a limited amount of violence that could be depicted.  The fight scenes were often skewed (but because they were not the bulk of the movie this is not as horrible a statement as it may seem.)The movie is exceptional and does stand on it's own.  This should not be considered the Lord of the Rings fan's second chance.  This is Narnia in and of itself.  (For the purists, this is virtually a direct adaptation.)  This movie is a solid 9/10.A delight.	5.0	A Delight	2005-12-10	13	7	6

I have taught for over 9 years now and this book is one of my students and my favorites. What an incredible work!!! So I was very nervous about another visual attempt at depiction. I have now watched the movie 4 times and I like it better every time. My wife purchased it for my birthday. The paramount themes were not lost and even many of the less obvious connections and symbols are not lost.I highly recommend it. I am, however, amazed that this movie was given such a poor showing at the Oscars. This is not a reflection on the movie, but one on the politicizing of the Oscars. Public opinion is a much better measure.I anxiously await the next faithful rendition of C.S. Lewis' great works. In literature, we all owe Lewis a great debt. I strongly encourge the reading of all the series. I have read them many times and never tire of them.	5.0	A Teacher's Review	2006-04-08	7	6	1

Although it did capture the basic plot, it did lack some soul to it. Disney and Walden did water down some of the symbolism of the book that made it rich. I do not agree father christmas and the story came when the children came into narnia. Well it did partly happen because of them but because ""Aslan is on the move."" It kind of made Aslan's significance smaller. Still, even if it captures just the surface text, the surface still says a lot. I cried twice over Aslan. Sure, one might say ""Yeah, right. The Passion of the Kitty."" But if one would really understand what Aslan did for Edmund (similar to what Christ did for us), one would cry to bits like me."	4.0	"""Aslan is on the move!"""	2006-02-17	15	7	8

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AXO4PQU0XG3TG	Dwight	I found the Narnia books to be frightening. The first not particularly eventful fifteen minutes of the film communicated the same insecurity and vulnerability of children in a not necessarily loving world.  The Narnia in the film looks exactly as I imagined it and the mere mention of the White Witch gives me the shivers probably because I believe in the dangerous aggressiveness of a woman with narcissistic personality disorder.  And Edmund's changed personality and anger at his family were classic signals of child who had been molested.  Before reading the Narnia books, I had read Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale about the Snow Queen and similarly, the boy in the fairy tale was captivated and held captive by the Snow Queen who planted an icicle in his heart which only was melted by tears of love.	4.0	Retains the terrifying character of the story	2006-11-20	14	0	14
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"For several years, fantasy films were MIA, except the occasional hack job.Then ""Lord of the Rings"" came and went, leaving some pretty big shoes to fill, as far as fantasy films go. ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"" doesn't quite fit the shoes, but it comes a lot closer than any other movie has.In Andrew Adamson's adaptation, C.S. Lewis's classic fantasy novel comes alive with remarkable fidelity, sparkling special effects, and some truly excellent acting by almost everyone concerned. If ""Lord of the Rings"" was stern older brother Peter, then this movie is Lucy -- bright, swift and thoroughly charming.With WW II raging, the four Pevensie children are sent to the countryside, at an eccentric professor's mansion. But during a game of hide-and-seek, little Lucy (Georgie Henley) hides inside a wardrobe -- and stumbles into a wintry wilderness, with a faun she befriends. Alas, her brothers and sisters don't believe her -- but they don't know that Edmund (Skandar Keynes) has also gone through, and befriended a sinister, beautiful Witch (Tilda Swinton).Eventually all four end up going through the wardrobe, but but they soon find that the Witch is hunting for them, in fear that they will fulfil an ancient prophecy. But Edmund has run off to join the Witch. And so the remaining three must join up with Aslan (Liam Neeson), the leonine god-king of Narnia. But the price for victory against the Witch may be too high.Since ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is labelled both a kids' book and a Christian fantasy, it's easy to get put off by the description of it. Don't be. Director Andrew Adamson (""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"") has obviously given this his whole heart and soul, and it has the right mixture of majesty and humor that a film like this needed.And Adamson does a spectacular job. The the taut race across a frozen river, the bombing of London, tea with the faun Tumnus, and even the cameo by Father Christmas (who gets a medieval makeover) -- all of these come to life with remarkable skill and grace, but with respect for its audience's intelligence. The make-or-break scene is Aslan stalking to the stone table, and the horrifying sacrifice scene that follows does justice to Lewis' novel.But Adamson doesn't let it get overinflated on its own ego. When Edmund tells his horse, ""Whoa, boy!"" it retorts peevishly, ""My NAME is Philip!""; elsewhere, the beavers snipe at each other like an old married couple. Those moments of lightness -- and giving Aslan a sense of humor -- keep the film from seeming self-conscious.And of course, the special effects. WETA workship deserves an award (it's been nominated for a few) for the amazing CGI, ranging from goat-legged Tumnus to the lion Aslan, who looks almost real. They are especially good in battle scenes, which are startlingly savage and brutal, but filled with outstanding moments, such as a centaur leaping over the Witch and nearly beheading her.Young Georgie Henley is probably the most capable actress here, conveying misery, awe, delight, childish glee and sorrow. All this from a small child, when a lot of adult actors can't manage that much. Skandar Keynes and Anna Popplewell turn in good performances as Edmund and Susan. Swinton and William Moseley (Peter) start off rather woodenly, but they both blossom when the four arrive in Narnia.Though Lewis was reportedly against a live-action adaptation of the Chronicles, it's hard to imagine him having a problem with this rapid-fire, sparkling adaptation.

When it was out it was at the top in the box office and everyone I have talked to had told me how much they loved it. The 4 kids and main stars of the film are William Moseley(Peter), Anna Popplewell(Susan),Skandar Keynes(Edmund) and Georgie Heneley(Lucy). All 4 were wonderfully talented actors and they carried theirs roles well. The CG characters which are made by a computer were very good looking and somtimes it was hard to tell they were animated at all. Aslan who everyone has been looking forward to see looked amazing at the expressions in his face looked very real and it was as if you were looking into the face of a real lion at moments. This DVD is also loaded with bonus features like interviews,bloopers, and more. The thing I like most on disc too is probly the part called ""The Childrens Magical Journey"" in which is shows the whole process of making the movies from the kids points of views. The bloopers were funny and I found myself laughing alot and there was so much more I can`t even explain it all. :). But by far one of the best things about the movie was the story for in it Aslan sacrifices himself to save Edmund just like Jesus in the bible and the christian meaning behing C.S.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AC75RZZVHKCPN	E. J.	"I thoroughly enjoyed this rendition of ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" Having read (and re-read) the book a number of times, the changes in the plot were obvious, but rather than detracting from Lewis's story, I think that they in some ways improve on the book. For one thing, the character development seems to have been strengthened in the movie.The first scene is of the bombing of London, and it introduces us especially to the personalities of Peter and Edmund Pevensie, who change the most throughout the movie. The Pevensies have just fled outside their home to escape the bombing when Edmund turns and runs back inside to get a picture of his father, who is fighting in World War II. Peter manages to catch up with him once inside and hauls him back to safety in disgust, with no consideration for Edmund's feelings. This introduces a pattern that we see a good deal of in the early part of the movie--Peter wants to take care of his siblings, but he doesn't quite manage, especially where Edmund is concerned. The opinions of Susan, the second-oldest, carry equal weight with Peter's at first, and for good reason.Lucy stumbles onto Narnia while hiding in a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek. She meets Tumnus, of course, and he takes her to his cave for tea. He plays a tune for her--a melody that sounds very authentically Narnian--and as he plays, fauns and other Narnian creatures seem to be dancing in the fire. The music has an almost hypnotic power over Lucy, who falls asleep watching the figures. Tumnus continues to play until the head of a lion appears in the fire, roaring, causing all the lights in the cave go out. This is our first introduction to Aslan.When Lucy comes out of the wardrobe, Edmund makes fun of her story by smirking about the football field he'd found in the bathroom cupboards. Peter tries to quiet him--rudely, deepening Edmund's resentment. So when Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe that night (Lucy sneaks back in to see whether Narnia is really there) we aren't surprised at how the White Witch manages to convince Edmund to bring his siblings to her by suggesting that they would be his servants. This chance to get on top of the pecking order is more than Edmund can handle, given the third-child syndrome that defines his character. The emphasis in the scene with the Witch is on his being the family misfit, not on the enchanted Turkish Delight.Lucy meets Edmund in Narnia and is so thrilled that she pounces on Peter, waking him up, to tell him that Edmund was in Narnia too. The young actors playing Edmund and Lucy handle the scene very well: the tiny smirk on Edmund's face after he sets Lucy crying by pretending Narnia is a game says it all.When Edmund breaks a window playing cricket, the children hide from the Professor's strict housekeeper in the wardrobe and wind up in Narnia. Edmund's resentment builds even more at the fur coat Peter gives him to wear as they explore. ""But that's a girl's coat!"" he protests. Peter, upset over Edmund's lie, merely says, ""I know."" The children stumble on Tumnus's wrecked cave, at which point Peter and Susan both insist on going home to safety. However, Mr. Beaver meets them and brings them to his dam. He tells them about Aslan and how they are meant to fulfill the prophecy and stop the White Witch. Peter refuses, wanting to protect his siblings from danger. (A good change from the book--what protective older sibling wouldn't question staying in Narnia considering the Witch?) However, Edmund is missing. ""I'm going to kill him,"" Peter says in angry disgust. Mr. Beaver's grim answer is chilling: ""You may not have to."" They chase after Edmund but don't catch him before he enters the Witch's ice castle. At this point, Peter has no choice but to find Aslan if he and the others are to save Edmund.They return to the dam so Mrs. Beaver can pack for their trip. However, Edmund betrays them to the Witch before he realizes her true intentions. The Secret Police wolves storm the dam, and the children and the Beavers escape through a secret tunnel. They are saved by a fox who is part of a sort of Narnian Underground. Then they continue onward to Aslan, nearly being caught on their way by the Witch and later by her wolves. Their journey is much more action packed than in the book, and I enjoyed the change.Edmund, meanwhile, is thrown into a dungeon by the Witch while the wolves storm the Beavers' dam, and there he meets a beaten-looking Tumnus and realizes how much damage he has done. (I was pleased that the directors focused more on Edmund than the book does, as he is my favorite character in the book.) The Witch turns Tumnus to stone, and Edmund's horror clearly shows that he has changed sides inwardly. The Witch takes him with her on the race to catch the other three children, and on the way her wolves bring the fox to her. She questions him, and when he won't answer, she raises her wand to turn him to stone. Edmund, desperate to stop her, gives her the information she wants. The fox is turned to stone anyway, but Edmund's inward change is made very evident by his unwise reaction.Edmund is eventually rescued from the camp of the Witch's army and makes up with his siblings. The Witch's coming into the camp and demanding Edmund's life is well done, as is the scene of Aslan's death. To the filmmakers' credit, the focus is not on the blood and gore--Aslan is not beaten by the Witch's creatures as in the book, and we do not see the knife entering his body. We instead share Lucy's horror as his eyes, meeting hers, widen and then close.I was also pleased that we got to see the actual battle (fighting but no blood) rather than the aftermath. Here Peter has completely stepped into his role of leader despite the fact that he knows Aslan is dead (Susan and Lucy sent a Dryad to tell their brothers) and that his army is outnumbered. His character development is complete. And Edmund puts his hard-won beliefs into action by smashing the Witch's wand. Peter, seeing the Witch then wound his younger brother, attacks and fights her. The fight seems unreal a few times (how did she not kill him when her swords were collaring his neck?) but is exciting. She finally trips Peter, knocks away his shield, and is ready to kill him when a resurrected Aslan, having arrived with the girls and reinforcements, pounces and kills her. (The statement in the book about ""the deeper magic"" that the Witch didn't know is eliminated in favor of her simply not understanding the Deep Magic because she didn't know the true meaning of sacrifice. Sacrifice to Aslan is giving of himself, but sacrifice to the Witch is sticking a lamb on an altar and slitting its throat.)Peter, Susan, and Lucy run to find the wounded Edmund, who is about to be killed by the Witch's dwarf when Susan shoots it with her bow. Lucy heals Edmund with a drop from her cordial and, at a look from Aslan, goes to help the other wounded.The next scene is the children's coronation, and then the stumbling of their grown-up selves back into their own world. (We can tell their growing younger as they begin to argue on their way through the coats. Though we do not actually see their transformation, we don't need to. The humor is stronger this way.) They fall out of the wardrobe to meet the professor, who is holding the cricket ball that started their adventure. I could not have asked for more and am eagerly awaiting the release of ""Prince Caspian."""	5.0	Wonderful rendition of Lewis's story	2008-03-30	4	2	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AC4OS65DJPQMN	E.L. Cruz	"The story takes place during World War II in England. The four Pevensie children are sent away to a remote mansion in order to keep them safe from the air raids. While playing hide and seek one day, the youngest girl, Lucy, finds an intricately carved wooden wardrobe in which she found a magical world swathed in eternal, snowy winter. She meets the friendly fawn, Tumnus, whom she becomes friends with. (A fawn, by the way, is a creature that has the torso of a man and the legs of a goat.) Eventually Lucy urges her three other siblings to join her, thus embarking them on a quest to defeat an evil queen in order to bring the real king to the throne of Narnia.This movie was pure delight to watch. Not only was the cinematography exquisite, but the writers did a great job of bringing the magic of the book to the big screen. This has got to be one of the best movies a child can watch. It is one of those films that has the power to shape a child's future, kind of like the way the movie ""Return to Oz"" had an effect on me.One thing that I found flawed was not really in the movie itself, but in the actual story that C.S. Lewis wrote. It disturbed me how unbelievably selfish the brother Edmund is. His acts, deeds, and deception are just pure evil, and I cannot fathom how a brother could do what he did to his other siblings. Oh well, I guess this observation is severely subjective, but that's just how I feel.Another thing that was kind of awkward was the ending. I just thought it was very strangely executed, and to be honest it seemed a little confusing and rushed. However, the pure magic and imagination of this film are stunning and will ultimately win viewers over."	4.0	Pure delight for children, vastly entertaining for adults.	2006-05-14	2	1	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3C7IV72JXQGJX	Elizabeth Carole	"A snow covered fairy land bound by an evil white witch. A timid fawn carrying an umbrella. Talking beavers and other friendly animals. Tales of a great lion call Aslan who can make all things right.  Four children step through an old wardrobe and stumble upon this new and mysterious world where their destiny is suddenly thrust upon them, as it quickly becomes their job to not only help save Narnia, but one of their own as well. Based upon the all time classic by C.S. Lewis, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" by Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media, is an excellent film production of a beloved fairytale where real life children are able to escape their own world to a magical land where they can become heroes to fight for truth.The story opens with the four Pevensie children: Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmond (SkandarKeynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) being sent away from their London home to great country side manor of an old professor to escape the bombing raids of WWII. One day while playing an animated game of ""hide-and-seek,"" Lucy, the youngest of the lot, hides in an old wardrobe only to suddenly discover that she is not in the wardrobe, but a magical snow covered land as well. After visiting with dear fawn, Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy), she soon returns back to her siblings with a seemingly tall tale a grand adventure of a great land in need of rescue from the hand of an evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton).Although the other Pevensie children find Lucy's tale amusing, they hardly choose to believer her. One day Edmond too stumbles into the magical land of Narnia, only to fall prey to the wiles of the evil White Witch who feeds his selfish desires, but he too quickly returns home to his siblings. Finally, all four children are thrust together into a grand adventure through the wardrobe where they must not only fight for each other and save Edmond from the White Witch's schemes, but join the in the fight along with their talking animal friends in hopes of saving Narnia. The soon begin looking to the great Savior of Narnia, Aslan (Liam Neeson), the ""Great Lion"" and only one who can ever hope to truly save the land of Narnia from the evil schemes of the White Witch.Intrigue, suspense, and adventure, this wonderful film depicts excellent cinematography that is sure to delight viewers young and old. Released theaters in 2005 and in DVD format in 2006, this movie quickly became a smashing worldwide hit through its top of the line mix of real actors and computer generation. Vividly real in its color and detail, the film seemingly draws the viewer into the story, and leaves them wishing they too could stumble into such delightful fairy worlds. Depicting child actors as its main characters, these youngsters do an excellent job carrying the starring roles through a perfect mixture of their own personalities that seem to genuinely fit so well with that of their roles. The only character who could possibly use a bit of improvement is that of the White Witch, who although plays her role in an excellent dramatic fashion, could have been portrayed a bit better with costumes and props that might have ""fit"" more with her harsh and horrid, evil role.Fitting with the ""family friendly"" style of the film, this movie depicts a suspenseful river crossing and climatic ""bloodless"" battle of the good Narnians against the evil White Witch and her minions in a classic battle of good versus evil, in a dramatic, yet tasteful fashion which leaves the suspense, but takes away the ugly goriness of  real life battles. The great wild, yet good Lion, Aslan must also play the key role in this tale of not only being the ""savior"" of Narnia, but one who is even willing to even give his life in the place of an undeserving traitor, while his role provides a clear parallel to another ""Great Savior"" as well.Quickly becoming one of my personal favorite movies, I would highly recommend this film to viewers of all ages who would enjoy an adventurous touching tale of a land where children can save the world, a great Savior pays the final price, and good always triumphs in the end. Astounding cinematography, a delightful soundtrack, thrilling effects, and wonderful acting, this movie certainly leaves viewers of all ages well pleased and wishing for more, or at least hoping to discover their own fairy land in the depths their own wardrobes."	5.0	The Wonderful Tale of Narnia	2010-03-03	1	1	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A21QGJ4AHCOHL8	E. Maxwell	"I started by plugging this movie with my youth group at church but not really knowing what to expect since I have never read the books and only had seen the old animated feature. I was told though through elders at the church and the kids that are in my youth group that this was truly a work of literature that was God inspired. Now saying that Im not saying that God came down and told C.S. Lewis what to write but that the Truth of the Bible inspired Mr. Lewis to capture the life-changing events that he had found in Scripture. What I found in the 2 times (soon to be 3) that I viewed this movie just how much the joy of a relationship with God and His love was revealed! There are many scenes that will just go by the waste side as ""just part of the movie"", but in fact are superb referances to the Bible. The main characters in this movie for me were not only the children but more so the Lion(Aslan) and the Witch(Jadis). In biblical referance, these two characters were representations of Jesus Christ and Satan. In a few scenes that stand out for me the most we see Jadis conversing with Edmund, one of the sons of Adam. Jadis came across as the self procalimed Queen of Narnia but in fact was the White Witch. Biblical referance refers to Satan as the lord of this world when in fact he is no more then a deciever. The most interesting part of this scene though is that Jadis promises Edmund the thing that he most desires at that moment, other then being taller, and she complies to give him a sample of his wish. She asks him to deliver his brother and sisters and she will give him a room full of the ""sweeties"" and make him king of Narnia. But Edmund could not deliver what it was that she asked but instead revealed to Jadis where they were and what was being carried out. Edmund feeling that he had fufilled Jadis's request asked her for a taste of his desire. She rewarded him by locking him in chains and feeding him stale bread/muffin and frozen solid drink. How often when Satan promises us our hearts desires that we carry out unknowningly his requests and our reward is no more then losing our innocence as Edmund had. Some of the scenes that featured Aslan showed how Jesus entered into this world. He entered not as a dictator to overthrow the Law(Prophecy) but to usher in the fufillment of the Law(Prophecy). In this Asaln did not raise a hand to the Witch until after he was sacrificied (crucified). Aslan entered as Jesus entered, a Prince of Peace who overcame death by His sacrifice and rose again. As the Bible states that He will return as a Conqueror to overthrow Satans reign in this world. In this movie this is portrayed as Aslan being slain, resurrected and overthrows Jadis's reign. There are so many more referances to the Bible in this movie that I cannot take the time to feature them in this review but encourage you to view this movie for the first time (or second) with the state of mind, heart and spirit that there is a story here that is eternally victorious then just the movie itself."	5.0	Truly God Inspired	2005-12-16	16	12	4

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2D86JTG0BW9US	"E. M. HAMILTON "".: Just Folks"""	"This review is for the THEATRICAL VERSION, not the not-yet-released DVD in any form.  When I have procured the Special Edition, I will then review that format/version.I must say that I was more than a bit apprehensive concerning My viewing of this film. I was as hesitant to see this as any bible-thumping fire and brimstone mom would be to see a Harry Potter movie, and for the same reasons...I didn't want Me and Mine subjected to religious beliefs to which we do not subscribe. It is for that reason that I refuse to see/own/borrow ""The Passion of the Christ"" or otherwise view it in any capacity.I had no idea what to expect. I frankly could not remember the story to save My life. I had to go online and read the Cliff Notes to remember the damned thing at ALL. I do remember that I had just completed a heinous wading through ""Pilgrim's Progress"" at the time [I was living with nuns then...OY!] and was about as thrilled about reading the LW&W; as I was over a visit to our sadistically twisted monk/dentist. Before that, I honestly had no memory of the work.Now that I've read the Notes and refreshed My memory, I can say that I do remember the story quite well. It was incredibly similar to Tolkien's works, which I would read in their entirety some 18 years later, making the connection only then.I must say the beginning of this endeavor brought the Lemony Snicket series immediately to mind. I do realize, of course, that the SoUE was written much later than the CoN; however, the casting choices for the parts of the children is more to what I refer. Naturally, there are four children here in the LW&W;, where in SoUE there were three, but I think anyone could see the similarities quite easily. Indeed, in the opening moments of LW&W;, I more than half expected to hear Jude Law's voice smoothing through the speakers to caution us that this would not be a happy tale.Many reviewers have [at this point] been quick to extoll the striking similarites between the LW&W; and the LotR, while others were more keen to demonstrate [ad nauseum, I might add] each detail of Christian symbolism Lewis found appropriately necessary to insert throughout his works, so I won't bore you with loads of those details. I have to point out a few, but that's only because the story is built around Christian myth and Tolkien's stolen ideas [alleged by Tolkien himself, not by this reviewer].I will, instead, attempt a different route and see where it leads us.*The introduction to our principal characters was an emotional one, setting up a small bit of character development, allowing you to ""know"" them as well as a few minutes' insight into their lives will allow.*Edmond is the petulant one, Pete[r] is the responsible ""daddy-like"" older brother.*Susan is ""just trying to be smart,"" and Lucy's duty to the cast is to be adorable; a task which she performs beautifully, I might add.The comparison to the Baudelaire children is astounding.*Susan is darker haired, pouty-lipped, wannabe braniac very much like Violet. The physical and characterizational similarities are astounding.*Both Edmond and Pete[r] serve to give us Klaus.*The two characters combine to constitute the depth of character given us by Liam Aiken which says a great deal about the quality of his acting abilities.*And Lucy takes the place of the cutesykins, Sunny. Of course, Lucy is a bit older and therfore offers us a tad bit more than cute expressions, meaningless gurgles, and ""offered meanings"" to her indiscriminate noises.*Their lives begin with startling parallel to the Baudelaires, in that their parents are absent from their lives, and they are sent to live with strangers.From there, the only resemblance to the cinematic SoUE work is the personalities of the characters, themselves. To illustrate that, I'll point out the striking similarities between Count Olaf and the White Witch [portrayed brilliantly by Tilda Swinton who also was more than adequate in her role as the Archangel Gabriel in Constantine].*Both are over the top.*Both are willing to go to any means to achieve their self-serving ends.It is My opinion that children and some adult] ""actors"" don't usually act. They remember their lines, and they pretend to be someone they're not, but acting is more than remembering lines. Acting is being your character, not just spouting thoughts and ideals which are not your own. An actor possesses the ability to make someone who is watching, believe that you are who you're pretending to be, to believe what you're saying.As far as the Tolkien references/rip-offs/similarities, there are simply too many to mention. It is My understanding that Tolkien and Lewis were both members of a literary club [known as the ""Inklings""] at Oxford during which time Tolkien would share the early drafts of his novels with the other members of the group. He claimed early on that Lewis was stealing his ideas, causing him to rewrite his drafts, and thereby forcing him to ""best"" his own works. So, if Tolkien was correct in his accusations, we have Lewis to thank for the beautiful works which are the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien and Lewis remained bitter enemies until Lewis's death in '65, and indeed, Tolkien still bore him a grudge until his own death in 1973. Some references state that they were friends and that's not entirely untrue. They were friends until Tolkien began to recognize his own words and ideas within Lewis's writings [according to Tolkien].Again, the similarities are many, but to name a few...* the entrance to Mr. Tumnus's lair looks remarkably similar to the entrance to Bagg's End* the archtypical fiend was the ""White Witch,"" whereas the LotR bears Saruman the White* beloved Gandalf sacrifices himself to save his friends [namesly Frodo] and dies at the hand of Magick used darkly and is ""reborn"" even more powerful because he was not dark, himself...just as Aslan dies at the hands of those who use Magick darkly, and is reborn through the means of a Magickal sacred stone altar which will crack and negate a sacrifice made erroneously [Aslan gave his life in Edmond's stead so Aslan was not the traitor, but was sacrificed as one which activated the spell on the sacred stone]* the battle scene build-up was very reminiscent of the larger, more involved Lord of the Rings battles [Helm's Deep especially], but not nearly as well done* the gryphons served the part of the Elves in that they were airbourne in their assault [shredding beaks and rending talons rather than archer's arrows, but in the air none the less]* ents* the maps were extremely Tolkien* Aslan returns from the grave like Gandalf, and for the same reason [the Laws of Magick]* the traveling party all received gifts from Santa Claus [also known as King of Elves]* right after Mr. Tumnus is released, the shot of the troups marching across the rock bridge atop the mountains looked like it was straight out of LotR! Call it ""homage"" if you will, but to Me, that was blatant...Now, I realize these Tolkien similarities [and there are more...many more] also involve the filming, direction, casting choices, location choices, DoP's choice of angles, etc. rather than what Tolkien and/or Lewis has written, hence My hesitation to sit here and go over any more of them. Those listed above are among the most obvious and blatant examples. There are more, to be sure.As far as the Christian symbolism contained within, there was surprisingly little. Below, I've detailed the most glaring instances.* the lion, Aslan, who returns from the dead [but c'mon! Gandalf returned from the dead and no one made the Christian connection with that!]* Aslan the Lion King was intended to represent Christ* the coat of arms on Narnia's shields and breastplates was reminiscent of Richard the LionHearted and those used during the Holy Crusades* they [the people of Narnia] refer to the children as ""Sons of Adam, Daughters of Eve""Those are about it. I realize there were more, but those are so subtle that no one BUT a religious zealot would care to notice.Now, for My ""different route.""* it strikes Me as more than a bit odd that a Lion King would be chosen as a representative of christ by Lewis when it was the very lions to whom the xtians were fed! He was much more closely associated with the King of the Island of Misfit Toys, if you ask me...* the Dogwood tree [beloved by xtians for symbolism only they read into it] was formerly used to grant wishes and bring protection to the home. It is the first tree flower to bloom in the Springtime, and although the Christians claim that is one of the xtian connections and CS Lewis was a Christian author, I still hesitate to give them that. I find its use more Pagan than Christian.* I considered the White Witch's alignment [that of Evil] to be a direct insult to all ""white"" witches. Christians are of the opinion that a witch is a witch, but if you've studied Paganism to ANY extent, you know that's just not the case. However, the usage here is quite obvious.* I also considered the White Witch to be the anti-thesis to Santa Claus. She rides in a belled sleigh drawn by white reindeer. She takes, rather than gives, and she is cruel down to her bones.* regardless of the Christian dogma throughout this work, it completely fails to achieve any hidden Christian agenda and uplifts that which it would condemn. Disney is great at that. LOL* Santa appears as the Holly King to bestow gifts upon the children which will help them in their tasks. This Santa is also on the side of Aslan, which could parallel the priesthood of Catholics and Druids who worked side by side for generations before the Druid tolerance of the Christians was used against them to force them out all together.All in all, I found this movie more Pagan through its use of Nature and Sympathetic Magicks than Christian. Aslan did rise from the dead, but due to a Law of High Magick, rather than ""divine intervention,"" thereby negating the xtian undertones completely.Honestly? I loved it. It was wonderful. It was the children's version of the Lord of the Rings saga.Unfortunately the costumes appear to have only just been made. They did not take the time and expense of ""aging"" the costumes, thereby lending an almost 80's television feel to this otherwise epic production. Everyone looked [most of the time] as if they just stepped out of the makeup trailer, which did nothing to dispell the 80's television feeling.The CGI was decent, but Aslan was not as well done as he should have been, considering the staggering budget this movie was awarded, the quality of actors and talent they had associated with this thing, and the name ""Disney."" I always expect the very best from Disney. I am often disappointed. The CGI in no way failed. It just was not what it should have been.This one nearly lived up to its potential. At any rate, I found ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" to be highly entertaining, heart-warming, and endearing.It rates an 8.5/10."	4.0	Purely Magickal 100% De-Christianized Fantasy.	2006-02-24	26	5	21

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AQZH7YTWQPOBE	Enjolras	After a horrid BBC adaptation of C.S. Lewis'The Chronicles of Narnia, Disney'sThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobedoes a decent job of bringing the first book to life. The Pevensie kids were generally well cast, and Georgie Henley as young Lucy steals the show. James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus is also very good. The film provides a visual feast, from snowy mountains to fauns and minotaurs.  Harry Gregson-Williams' moving soundtrack provides an epic backdrop for the action.Unfortunately, as much as I like it, I just felt like I couldn't giveThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobefive stars. Coming so soon after the Lord of the Rings trilogy,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobeobviously invites comparisons. However, Disney just doesn't meet the high standards those films set. For one thing, some of the roles are miscast. William Moseley as Peter never shows much passion. Tilda Swinton as the evil queen never really worked for me, although she has some moments (such as riding in a sleigh pulled by polar bears). Some of the animal computer-generated characters look cartoonish, especially the wolves, although Aslan the lion himself looks great. Overall, these are a few details that, with a bit more work, could have been improved.I think it's fair to say thatThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobewill be remembered as a well-done, entertaining movie adaptation, but not an outstanding work of art along the lines of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. The film is fun, entertaining, and likely to please fans of Lewis' novels, but, with a bit more time and effort, could have been even better. Ultimately, I don't think Disney and director Andrew Adamson were a right fit for the series, which makes it good news that the next films (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader) will be in good hands.	4.0	Good film adaptation, but could have been great	2009-12-27	0	0	0

Now that I have finally seen the film, it is time for me to pull out my dusty paperback novel and read it again. Since I haven't read the book in ages, I can't really compare the film with the novel. Like most books turned into films (i.e ""Memoirs of a Geisha""), I am sure there was some alterations in the film adaptation.The film centers around four siblings: Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy Pevenise. The four are sent to the countryside to live with a mysterious professor because of the heavy bombing that is occuring in London during WWII. During a game of hide and seek, Lucy discovers a cabinet which leads to another world called Narnia. At first her older siblings do not believe her but eventually they do when she takes them to Narnia. It is revealed that there is a prophesy that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve would one day come to Narnia and help vanquish the White Witch.Although I am not of particular faith, I was not bothered by the Christian references in the film. I went into this movie with the idea that this was purely entertainment, and entertained I was. I enjoyed the internal conflicts Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy had to endure before the climatic battle. I personally liked Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan. He spoke as if he was as old and wise as Aslan. Every actor in the film was spot on.I loved the costumes and the CGI effects. The two disc special edition is a real treat. It is packed with goodies like bloopers, commentary from the director, anatomy of a scene, and other behind the scenes look at the film and actors.

It's a great movie, although there are some variations from the book, to be sure. I think I still like the ""feel"" of the animated version from years ago a little better. But this version is excellent in its own right.My main reason for posting is this: My daughter and I are watching the DVD version now, and are just about thru it. My memory isn't quite as good as her's, but she has pointed out that she remembers quite a few scenes in the ""theater"" version that seem to be changed in the ""DVD"" version. 2 examples she has pointed out have been #1 - when Edmund gets thrown in the prison cell there are a couple little lines missing, and #2 - when Peter kills the wolf, she says that scene has been slightly edited as well.So, I guess I'm wondering if the DVD has really been altered, or is she is remembering incorrectly?  :)If the DVD HAS been altered, then take this as a warning to wait for the ""Unedited"" DVD version to come out down the road."	4.0	Excellent movie, but some changes from the theater version?	2006-06-07	3	2	1

It was!Like many others here, I grew up with a love for Narnia.  In fact, ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" inspired me to become a novelist myself.  I wanted to pass on the same joy that Lewis gave me.  After the success of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies, I had cautious anticipation for the release of this Narnia film.  Would they get it right?  Would they capture the magic?  Would Aslan and the White Witch seem real?The answer is: Yes!  I sat in the theater, judging every scene, every element.  As the titles rolled, I let out a sigh of relief.  Then, going back to see it again, I was able to enjoy it fully.  No more worries.  Pure childlike escape.  The four children are so beautifully cast for this film; the White Witch is acted and costumed to perfection; and Aslan seems kind and benevolent, while still maintaining a regal air.  I knew the animals would come to life in Narnia when I saw the first scenes with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver.  I loved the humor thrown in.Sure, there are a few things that deviate from the book.  No, I was never a fan of the Father Christmas scene.  Admittedly, the fox in the movie never seems real to me.  But those are small concerns in the big picture.  The overall magic is there.  And in the collector's edition, you can see behind-the-scenes in wonderful ways.  If you ask me, I think Lewis would be pleased."	5.0	The Overall Magic is There	2006-04-15	4	4	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2F1P10GGZ7K2T	Erik1988	"If you don't know the story, its about 2 brothers and their 2 sisters who are sent out to the country to live with a distant relative. With nothing to do the kids play hide & seek, in which the youngest discovers a wardrobe to hide in. The wardrobe isn't just any old place to hang coats but is actually a doorway to an enchanted world.Brining such a classic to the big screen is a huge undertaking, just as Peter's Jacksons' attempt at Lord of the Rings. Critics are in any case going to abound as one attempts to translate such a well loved series of books to a new media format. Does the translation happen well?I'd have to say, ""Yes"".Some suspense is lost in some scenes as they are cut short to save film time (such as Edmunds flight from the beaver's house), but overall the main points are carried well to the screen and with good direction and special effects. The style of movie is very much like Jackson's Lord of the Rings though not quite as dark and ghastly even though this movie deserves the PG rating as it may be too much for some young kids.The movie leaves the childish telling of the book for a more mature, action feel and for an adult it is well received. My kids love the animials and creatures (minataurs and centaurs) and how some were inherently on the side of good and some on the side of evil.The acting was well done even by the youngest star of the show.The direction was well handled and gave me enough eye candy that I loved some of the cinematography of the show. I thank God that the director didn't try the old MTV, shaky camera technique to give the feel of movement and fighting.The sound and editing were great and I felt the thunder of hoofs as the two armies charged each other.You never see any blood in the movie and even the scene with Aslan on the stone table is handled well as I was first concerned the director may make it too gruesome for my young kids.I was left with a feeling that more was to come as if this movie is the intro to something bigger (in some sense it is considering this is the first of 7 books), but I was also happily satisfied in the end.NOTE: when the credits start don't stop watching, they throw a little something more about a 30-60sec into the credits to close out the story. By then half the people had already walked out of the theater and missed it.Overall, I'd feel this was appropriate for ages 8+ (considering our cultural exposure to content nowadays) and it is enjoyable for adults too.If you haven't read the book do that first though. Its a fun little read."	4.0	a pretty good flick. . .	2006-03-21	4	4	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	ANTZTCPTIJ1J9	FaithDad	"We really appreciate the Chronicles of Narnia being made into such an outstanding Movie -- literally, the first truly family movie, in awhile, that centers on character in many diverse situations (excluding Veggie Tales -- only because of being animation, and somewhat limited - in appeal to older kids).  And the multifaceted consequences of your choices; the importance of using Biblical Values for the foundation of your choices.  While doing it all with great kid actors, lots of action, great cinematography, plus great special effects.In fact, the Chronicles of Narnia, are the first books that my son is really getting into (I have a confession - I am thoroughly enjoying them also), and WANTS to read all seven!  Plus, these books open up many discussions between us.Think about this, how/why can any decent person, of honest conscience, and a good heart EVER have a problem with Biblical Values which result in the best kids, WITH good manners, hope, and faith in the future, and in something bigger, and better than themselves, that (God) promises to help them through anything in their lives, if they get to know/trust in him, and pursue HIS way of doing and being right -- no matter what seems/appears right in today's society, or feels good to you at the time.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	ALR1CN6DL50DA	Felixpath	"""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is spellbinding, a beautifully-realized adaptation of C.S. Lewis's classic fantasy yarn. It has endless appeal: fantasy lovers will eat it up, those who view the Narnia books as a religious parable will not be disappointed, and families who were afraid to take their children to ""Lord of the Rings"" will be relieved to know that ""TLtWatW"" is less bloody and more intimate, although it has plenty of action and excitement. It works on every level.The film opens in the middle of the London Blitz, as a mother and her four children cower in a bunker while bombs rain down. The scene seems out of place at first, but it serves to strengthen the fears and emotions of the main characters while providing a counterpoint to later scenes. Soon the four Pevensie kids -- stalwart Peter (William Moseley), practical Susan (Anna Popplewell), brooding Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and plucky Lucy (Georgie Henley) -- are shipped off to the quiet country estate of an elderly professor (a twinkle-eyed Jim Broadbent). It is there, during a game of hide-and-seek, that Lucy finds a dusty spare room and a towering, ornate wardrobe. A perfect hiding place, she thinks, but the wardrobe seems much bigger on the inside, and then her hand brushes a snow-covered pine branch...Narnia is a sweeping world of hills and forests, cloaked (at first) in swirling snow. Lucy meets a friendly satyr named Tumnus (James McAvoy) who explains that the land is ruled by Jadis, the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who has made it ""always winter, and never Christmas."" Back on Earth, Lucy's siblings don't believe her story, but soon Edmund finds his way into Narnia -- where he is beguiled by the White Witch -- and Peter and Susan follow. They promptly find themselves number one on the Witch's hit list, thanks to an ancient prophecy foretelling that four young humans will end the times of evil. All of Narnia's animals are also people, as the Pevensies discover when they are helped out by a charming beaver couple (voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French) and a clever red fox (Rupert Everett), and narrowly escape from a snarling wolf pack that is also the Witch's police force.Yes, war is coming to Narnia, and the forces of good -- centaurs, fauns, gryphons, and the like -- are rallying under the command of the legendary lion Aslan (benevolently voiced by Liam Neeson). The Witch has her own army of imps, minotaurs, cyclopses, werewolves, and other nasties, and she's also tricked Edmund into betraying his siblings. It seems that Peter, Susan, and Lucy are fated to lead the battle. They are horrified at first, and the film nicely underlines their unhappiness at finding themselves in greater danger than before. ""Mother sent us here to get us AWAY from war!"" Susan protests, but fate is fate, and when Saint Nicholas himself turns up to bestow weapons on the Pevensies, they are forced to admit that they can't leave, not now. As for the religious parable -- for those of you who don't know the story -- I will only say that Aslan stands in for Jesus Christ, and Edmund is the sinner redeemed. As a nondenominational person, I like the fact that the film neither ignores the Christian undertones nor emphasizes them. The viewer is left to decide.The special effects by Weta Workshop are superb, a skillful combination of prosthetics, animatronics, and CGI. Weta also did the LOTR trilogy, and based on those films and this one, I'd say there's nothing they can't do. I was especially impressed by the animals, who are always realistic and never ""cute,"" but still provide some comic relief (a talking horse named Phillip gets the biggest laugh in the movie). Indeed, the screenplay sneaks in some decent, PG-rated one-liners (""Just because a man in a red suit put a sword in your hands does NOT make you a hero!"" Susan snaps at Peter), and the four young actors do a fine job of carrying the film from danger and sadness to wonder and joy. The White Witch has always been a very one-dimensional character, but Swinton, with her ghostly beauty and icy gaze, avoids teeth-gnashing hamminess and plays Jadis as a primal, implacable force of evil. There is not a shred of humanity in this woman (if she is a woman), whether she's tempting Edmund with magical sweets or turning good guys to stone with her wand. That's as it should be. I was annoyed at the movie for encouraging the stereotype that wolves are evil, but what can you do? It's in the book. Actually, almost everything in the book makes it into the movie, and there's even room for some extra action scenes, the most effective of which involves a melting waterfall. ""TLtWatW"" is probably the most faithful book-to-movie adaptation since ""Holes,"" so Lewis purists won't be let down. Yes, the final battle is more epic and violent than Lewis would have wished, as gryphons drop boulders on screaming goblins, a phoenix sets the battle plain on fire, and Peter hacks and slashes his way to a one-on-one duel with the Witch. But I've resigned myself to the fact that certain Hollywood-friendly adjustments must always be made, and so I was able to enjoy the climax for its own sake.Director Andrew Adamson, best known for the ""Shrek"" films, shows that he is not limited to animation. ""TLtWatW"" is a worthy, entertaining film, and with any luck, it will inspire a new franchise. There are seven books in the Narnia series, after all.

The most magical moment for me was the entire scene starting when Lucy steps back into the snow and discovers Narnia to when she awakens and the fawn helps her return to the lamp post.About the only thing that I didn't like was Liam Neeson's voice as Aslan.  It was too recognizable.  Everytime Aslan would talk, it would jolt me right out of the movie to visions of Liam Neeson.  He's a great actor, and I've enjoyed his films, but for me his voice didn't work for Aslan.Edmond is truly easy to hate.  They never redeem him fully.  The battle scene was oddly disjointed from the rest of the story.  Like it didn't fit, or was too Return-of-the-King-ish.  The movie really could have stood on its own with the magic and adventure, it didn't need a battle scene.  What were they trying to make it?  Like Bedknobs & Broomsticks?

(TS is a marvellous actress who can pull off nearly any role and with great distinction:  cf. ""Broken Flowers."")  Except for the nearly-final scenes, where she apparently fancied herself Boudicca in a chariot drawn by computer-polar bears, she is the consummate, indeed the definitive ""wicked witch.""  (She brings to her role something others, from Margaret Hamilton to Angelica Huston lacked - something that perhaps only Europeans know is implicit in all witches - a threatening sexiness.  This is not-quite-implicit in her initial subornation of the boy Edmund.)  Georgie Henley is an animated ""Lucy,"" but in general the movie is lost in computer visuals instead of burrowing into the symbolisms of C.S. Lewis' novel.  Her siblings are terrible in their roles, particularly the males, although Anna Popplewell seems only to be able to look doe-eyed - occasionally.  (Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan is just plain terrible.)The thought-processes of the six producers are not hard to imagine:  hey, it's got kids, it's got witches, it's got battles - and it's got story!  When will Hollywood stop feeding the ""sure-thing money-maker"" data into computers and producing films without heart?  It's like one of those awful cooking show recipes:  take four kids, place them into war, but then outside it in a far-away old English country manor, add in magic portal, spice with various mythical creatures, fold in a bad witch for piquant.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2VE83MZF98ITY	"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick"""	This is a wonderful film for the entire family.  The effects are staggering, and the story is faithful to the original story - The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.Two sons of Adam and two daughters of EveC.S. Lewis was a great storyteller and a great theologian.  He was able to weave together elements from fairly orthodox Christian belief into metaphoric stories that show a classic battle between good and evil in ways that transcend the purely Christian context.  Elements such as the innocence and wonderment expressed by children, the power of nature and natural elements, the struggle between good and bad - these are things that have been shown in mythological and cultural stories from the most ancient of times up to the modern day television serials.  They are brought to a strong pitch here in this film, hopefully the first of several installments of the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia.One needn't be Christian to enjoy these tales, nor must one subscribe to any particular theology to find them accessible - this really isn't evangelism as it is known via 'televangelism' today.The director Andrew Adamson and writers Ann Peacock,Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely worked with the estate of C.S. Lewis to strive to remain faithful to Lewis' original vision in terms of story and characters, but also to allow for the developments of technological expression that permit fuller visualisation than Lewis could give.  This also occurs in the acting - the four leading roles of children are played by relative newcomers:  Georgie Henley plays Lucy, Skandar Keynes plays Edmund, William Moseley plays Peter, and Anna Popplewell plays Susan - the four Pevensie children exiled from London during the war, thrust into an austere and severe household in the country that is full of real-life mystery apart from the wardrobe that holds the portal to Narnia.  The film is very faithful to the spirit of Lewis' work, as well as much of the detail of the stories.  This makes this a good companion to encourage reading.Narnia is presented not as a fantasy or dream (a la Peter Pan or Wizard of Oz), but rather as a real place; comparisons will be made with the Lord of the Rings trilogy in  many respects (including the incredible scenery from New Zealand mountainous regions), but one primary difference here is that the connection to the real world here is very real indeed.  The White Witch, portrayed by Tilda Swinton, is played in a very realistic way - she represents what children fear the most, not as much bloody violence and evil as much as a cold detachment and lack of caring and compassion (something that children in all eras find frightening).  Just as the place is real, the children are real, and the situations in the real world are just as harrowing as those in Narnia.  However, in Narnia (unlike the real world) it is the children who have the real power.The CGI effects are astounding, but the voices bring the real life to the characters.  Actors such as Liam Neeson (Aslan), Rupert Everett (Fox) and Dawn French (Mrs. Beaver) add their unique personalities to the characterisations of the animal roles.  Things are done in a truly wonderful way.This is a film for all ages, and all sorts of people who love a good story.	5.0	We're not heroes - we're from Finchley!	2005-12-10	12	7	5

I found this movie to be a serious disappointment. The plot was meandering and the characters were unappealing. The special effects were marginal and the movie was too long for small children and too juvenile for adults. Honestly, I heard the children sitting behind me ask their mother to leave before the film was over at least a dozen times. I also had problems with the philosophical message of the story. It basically endorses ""the divine right of kings"" and the existence of a ruling elite who hold their place by destiny, rather then achievement.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1G9FX1KV45N41	Gary Selikow	Four children-Peter (William Mosley ), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes)and Lucy (Georgie Henley) , are sent into the country , from London, during World War II , because of air raids.They are sent to the house of an old Professor , in the heart of the country.There the youngest , Lucy comes across an old wardrobe , and stumbles through it into the Land of Narnia , who she meets Mr Tumnus (James McAvoy) , a faun.Later Edmund also go's through the wardrobe into Narnia , where he meets the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who lures him into her service , with magic Turkish Delight.Later all of the children are swept into the adventure where the White Witch , who rules with an iron fist over Narnia , tries to prevent the prophecy whereby the lion Aslan (Liam Neeson) , will free Narnia and change the eternal winter (where Christmas is not allowed) into the enchanted land which it once was.This is a glorious film version the book. Each of the cast are perfect for their roles.There are some outstanding scenes - such as the frightening scene where Aslan is sacrificed by the White Witch and her evil cohorts (hags , minotaurs , red and black dwarfs , trolls and goblins just to name a few of the sinister minions of the White Witch), and the battle scene near the end where Aslan's army (which include centaurs , gryphons and leopards), led by Peter , faces the White Witches forces (which include tigers).New characters and dimensions are introduced in he movie ,  unlike the Lord of the Rings movie (where characters and scenes out of neccesity had to be cut out-due to the length of the book) and it fits the picture perfectly.Characters introduced just for the film include the Fox (read by Rupert Everett) and General Oreius (Patrick Kake). Tilda Swinton is  coldly  diabolical and chilling, as the White Witch. Kiran Shah comes puts across pure spite as  the sadistic dwarf Ginnabrik .And William Mosley , Anna Popplewell and Skandar Keynes fit the roles of Peter , Susan and Edmund perfectly.But it is Georgie Henley as the absolutely adorable Lucy who is the undoubted star of the show.This colurful and stunning epic is a testament to the struggle between good , reperesenting Judeo-Christian civilization , and the evil forces of terror and tyranny, which can only be fought and defeated.There can be no compromises or negotiation with terror.	5.0	Stunning epic of Narnia	2006-06-16	0	0	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AAEP8YFERQ8FC	General Breadbasket	"There's been quite a few adaptions of C.S. Lewis' book ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" made. There was a cartoon movie, there was a British TV serial, and now there is a big budget movie, the first in a series of Narnia films. I was very excited when I heard they were doing this, since I'm a very big C.S. Lewis fan. Apart from a couple of very minor hiccups, it was a very fine film indeed.Due to the War the four Pensevie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are sent into the country, where they will be looked after by Professor Kirke. Kirke lives in a rather large house, so there's plenty of places for hide and seek. During on of their games, little Lucy stumbles upon a world within a wardrobe, a world full of talking animals, fauns, nymphs, dwarves and driads, a world where it is always winter and never Christmas thanks to a White Witch named Jadis. Under her reign, Narnia is miserable and oppressed, but there are rumours among the talking animals that Aslan the lion, Narnia's true king, is on the move and that a prophecy is due to be fulfilled.First of all, I've got to say that I'm glad the producers started the series with ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" rather than ""The Magician's Nephew"", which as a book worked better as a prequel than as an introduction to Narnia. There's been a lot of fantasies based on books lately, so I'm sure there have been a lot of comparisons to the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" film franchises. I've seen most of both of those film series, and I personally like this Narnia film just a bit better than both of them. The plot is fuller and better flowing than the ""Harry Potter"" films (which I'd be totally lost on without the books, and much more fun and colourful than the ""Lord of the Rings"".The kids are well cast, they look as I'd imagined them to in the books, more or less. They also look like they care about each other very much, which really helps the emotion and family side of the messages in the film. The White Witch is also played very well. Just like Edmund, you could mistake her for a motherly figure to begin with, but just watch the emptiness in her eyes. Brilliant! The effects are you're typical 2000s blend of computer graphics, prosthetics and blue screen, but they do the job well enough.J.R.R. Tolkien, though a good friend of C.S. Lewis', was never a big fan of the Narnia series. He just couldn't get his head around the fact that all these elements of various mythologies and cultures (fauns, dryads, Father Christmas, etc) were sharing the same imaginary place. Though I think Tolkien was being a little obsessive there (they're just imaginary creatures, J.), he does have a little bit of a point. It must have been a task for the design team of the film to have everything gel together, but they manage to succeed I thought. Narnia's Father Christmas, for instance, is no Santa stereotype in the film. He wears a subdued red-brown suit, is fairly trim, and though he's grey and bearded still has a tinge of red to his hair. Though he chuckles, he never once says ""ho ho ho!"", and he never once introduces himself by name. This is a Father Christmas that fits in very well with Narnia, I thought.C.S. Lewis was fascinated with both the works of creation around him, and those moments in life where they looked or felt or tasted spectacular. He used to describe them as ""the joy"". Though the beautiful scenery is mostly in the background, I think director Andrew Adamson had some idea of this, just by the way he sets up some of the shots. As a modern fantasy film, it is rather atmospheric compared to some of its contemporaries, whose plots and scenery just whiz by with no time to smell the flowers. Good job.C.S. Lewis was a devoted and intellegent Christian, and through the plot you can see that (Aslan is like Jesus, who has to die for Edmund's mistakes just like Jesus had to die for ours, etc). In the film, I notice a couple of visual themes had been added. The crossing and falling into the river reminded me a little of baptism for instance.There have been a couple of diversions from the book, some good, some not so good I say. I liked the World War II intro and the 1940s music while the kids play hide and seek, it gave the children's world a little more context which C.S. Lewis (writing in the early 1950s) would have most probably taken for granted. I didn't really appreciate the Hollywood-ness of the wolves. C.S. Lewis (just like Tolkien) was very particular about the words he used, and I don't know what he would have thought about some of the almost action movie villain lines the wolves have. Still, it's really only a minor point, that one.Special features on this version of the DVD include two audio commentaries from the crew and a blooper reel. In this bloopers everyone looks like they were having lots of fun, which is always a good sign. There's also a Narnia ""Fun Facts"" option, introduced by a relative of C.S. Lewis. When you turn the fun facts on during the film, they pop up, telling you bits and pieces about the making of the film, elements of the story and about the author C.S. Lewis. I'm a pretty avid C.S. Lewis fan, of both his life and his works, but I did actually learn some things. I had never made the connection that he died the same day as President Kennedy. 22nd of November 1963, honestly, that day gets stranger and stranger the more I hear about it...Anyway, I say its a good family film, a great fantasy, great primer for the rest of the series, and though it's not 100% to the book, it's good enough for me. However, I am very much hoping that they do the last half of ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" and the end of ""The Last Battle"" (my favorite bits of the series) exactly by the book, since they're such vivid and beautiful pieces of writing."	5.0	Great Adaption	2006-07-31	12	9	3

However, from what you can see, it is tastefully done, and well worth the price.  I have viewed the DVD movie and shorts previously released, and it is a great film.  The special effects do not overwhelm the story, which sticks very close to the original.  The enclosed bookends are cast resin and painted, with great detail.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A15Q9YEG1XPEJN	Get What We Give	"The Chronicles of Narnia is a massive film. To compare to Lord of the Rings is unfair (and I won't since I didn't really care for the Ring Trilogy - never read the books either...). I think the more fair comparison would be the Harry Potter films. And even that isn't dead on.Let's start with the actors. The children are all engaging, but I couldn't help thinking that they could have found more earnest and, yes I'll say it, talented actors. Now...to give the devil his due...these children were forced to ""act"" with nothing! They were working with green screens and disks on sticks. It's extremely difficult for a trained and aged actor to perform their craft in those circumstances. However, it would still seem that the director should have coaxed some better performances out of the kids. Peter, in particular, seems uncomfortable at times acting. His delivery is often stilted and amateurish. Does it make him unlikable? Far from it. Undoubtedly these young actors were chosen, in part, because the expectation is there to carry on the film franchise and these kids are deemed to be up to the task. Having not read the books, I can only assume that the young actor playing Peter was chosen for his angelic looks and his earnest demeanor.Now to the film overall. It's definitely good. It, I understand, is somewhat true to the book (which I think is always good). However, I wanted a bit more. Why is the white queen bad? Why has she turned everything to ice and snow? (By the way, Tilda Swinton is great in the part!). In what is the childrens' appearance foretold? Is it a book? or merely a legend? You get my idea. It would seem that just a couple of sentences of extra ""backstory"" and expositional material could have made the film as robust as the detailed telling done in the Harry Potter films.The CGI effects...Aslan doesn't always look great. Sometimes he's uncannily real looking and other times, no. The fox never looks real. Occasionally the beavers look quite cartoonlike. I'm willing to bet the CGI effects will improve as the series continues. After all, Dobby, in Harry Potter, looked quite CGI to me and even Golum looked cartoonish at times in LOTR.Overall, this is a great family film and one that adults and kids alike will enjoy. Please don't let my criticism be viewed as anything more than it is. We're lucky that such films can now be made and our expectations of them are for that of reality. We've come a long way from the Ray Harryhausen days of stop motion animation...so much so that we can now criticize the animation and compare it to ""reality"".Get this film and you'll be happy you did."	4.0	Entertaining, but somehow not as robust as expected	2006-04-05	5	2	3

The characters are generic and lack motivation. The visual effects were less than standard. Most of the animals (For the exception of the Lion)looked really fake and it was really easy to spot ""green screen"" shots. Most actors did a fine job with the huge exeption of the kids who never seem to realize what a big deal it was to be in a fantasy world or to fight a war. But the biggest problem was the story which was genric, boring and without a purpose.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A17IW44FV0HUTY	Glen Engel Cox	"I was always a bigger fan of C.S. Lewis and the Narnia books than I was of Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings. It probably was due to always wanting to escape this world, as the Pevensy children get to, whereas LotR is a self-contained world that has no traffic from this world of ours. Lewis was much more accessible, too, when I originally read the books. Although a precocious reader--I was reading the same books my brother was reading when I was six and he was nine--I didn't always ""get"" what I was reading, nor did I enjoy it just because I could read it.So I was excited by the success of the Peter Jackson Lord of the Ring series and the Harry Potter movies enabling a true, big-budget Narnia film. Even if they don't end up making all seven (because I really can't see The Last Battle making much of a movie), if they can just do justice to my favorite, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, I'll be happy. To make that movie, the first one, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, has to be good. After seeing it this weekend, I'm a little worried about the future of the series. It's not that this first movie is bad per se. The acting, visualizations, and direction is as good as any of the Potter movies. But there's lots of little things about it that bugged me, including what many have already noted: the Christian allegorical elements (which really aren't that allegorical as they are simply thematic) in the book seemed much more subtle than what comes across on screen. I don't think this is a failing of the screenplay or director, but simply a reflection of the difference of the two medium. The book leaves much to the imagination, including a large segment of the final battle. That wouldn't work in film.The best actor is the young boy who plays Edmund, although Tilda Swinton's Jadis strikes just the right element of regal creepiness. But Swinton only has to be evil, while Edmund has to be sullen, resentful, eager, duplictious, remorseful, and accepting. None of the other children have as difficult a role: Peter just has to be Peter, Susan has to be a little more holier-than-thou, but not by much, and Lucy just has to be cute. After the movie, J and I were discussing it and I was saying that since Edmund is the protagonist, it's good that he was the strongest actor. J disagreed with me, saying that Lucy is the protagonist, as she's the one who discovers the wardrobe and has the closest relationship with Aslan. Instead, J said that I identify with Edmund because he's the little brother and has a name similar to mine (my middle name is Edward). Agreeing with her at the time, I've thought about it some more and believe that beyond those simple identifications, Edmund has to be the protagonist, because in Christian terms, Edmund is us. That is, if Aslan is Christ, it is Edmund (i.e., us) whom he dies for and redeems. The other children are just a means to provide Edmund with original sin.In technical terms, the film does a great job with Aslan and many of the talking animals. There were times when the children were set against scenery that it was noticeable that they weren't ""in the place"" but instead before a blue screen, and that wasn't due to poor acting skills a la those horrendous Star Wars prequels, but because of poor matting or poor lighting or some technical combination. Tumnus the faun was the best Gollum effect, although the centaurs were a close second, and even the battle scene was nice, although we'd seen it all before in the Jackson films.Here's hoping that they continue the series, at least through the next four books, and improve their skills with each. I liked this one enough that I'd be willing to go to the next."	3.0	Worthwhile effort	2006-01-01	13	13	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1FAKZ848PO3V8	GLENN WHELAN	What starts out looking like a boring weekend in a moth ball infested old house, turns in to an adventure for all time for four young children. For when they enter into a dusty wardrobe, passed the coats they come into a snow covered world of Narnia. Here they find magical creatures and find they are prophesized to rule the kingdom. In the meantime, the evil white witch does all she can to keep the little buggers down, but things really heat up when the former leader of the land, Aslan - a magnificent lion - returns to bring peace. The story culminates in a huge battle between good and evil.  The series of seven Narnia books were intended for children, so I needn't tell you how the battle turns out.In December of 2005, THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE made a huge appearance, traveling successfully to the screen. There have been sufficient animated and televised versions before, but this is the real deal with amazing sets and a pretty loyal screenplay. Like the books, the humor remains light and un-offensive. Even the story concepts, including an appearance by Father Christmas, are comfortable for the youngster in all of us. It is nothing like the complex structure used in the Harry Potter films that many children are devouring today.But after the monster success of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, the book did receive a face-lift.  Gone is the dialogue that only can be read to the very small in favor of a more mature speech.  Battles that took up a couple hundred words on the page are now major battles and even share an aesthetic with a certain hobbit adventure. The special effects creators are also shared with the RINGS trilogy.The Narnia stories are indeed a Christian allegory, but C.S.Lewis' message is lost on many on both sides of the argument.  He used biblical story elements as his own personal guide.  His major intention was not to preach, but to entertain.  Reviewers who dismiss the book and films based on its Christian ties are not likely to gain any converts.  Nor will those who demand the work be altered to explore those Christian themes.The DVD set is a strong offering:  Gorgeous sound and packaging, grand making of material, everything that is now expected from a major DVD release. One where every film is given the deluxe treatment, no matter how deserving.I'm looking forward to our next cinematic trip into Narnia...

They had included William Moseley playing Peter Pevensie, Anna Popplewell playing Susan Pevensie, Skandar Keynes playing Edmund Pevensie and Georgie Henley playing young Lucy Pevensie. Director Andrew Adamson has takne 4 new actors and put them in a timeless classic by C.S.Lewis. The movie had a great deal of suspense, but it also delt with borthers and sisters love for eachother overcoming anything at all. When the white witch had captred Edmund, Peter, Susan, and Lucy will do anything to get him back. The white witch is played by Tilda Swinton does  fablous job playing her. But the true heros in the story are Aslan, voiced by Liam Neeson the king who watches over Narnia and Peter who learns that when pushed he can overcome great obsticules. All i know is that when everyone had thought the movie had ended a last part had happended and everyone was glued with there butt's to the seats, and eyes to the screen.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	CS Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia may very well have been a book intended for children but it was also the result of a life through the Great Wars and the effects those wars had one the individual.  Gratefully in Andrew Adamson's directorial hands that part of the story that lends the need for the fantasy is preserved.The concept of separating children from their parents during the Blitz in London in WW II is now showing up in many novels.  Lewis was one of the first to address the trauma these separations had on children. Adamson opens his film with some fine footage of the aerial German blitz and the terror of the Londoners running for bomb shelters.  The family in focus is the Pevensie family - Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley), and Susan (Anna Popplewell) - and these four children are sent off to a safe mansion owned by the Professor (Jim Broadbent).  The mansion has a wardrobe that begins the fantasy, Lucy being the first to enter the kingdom of Narnia through the back of the wardrobe.  Soon the four children are all together in the snowy place and encounter first a faun, then the Queen of Narnia/White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and there begins the struggle for domination and secrets that gradually resolve the mystery of Narnia, that mystery carefully paralleling Christianity through the forces of the kind Lion Aslan (Liam Neeson).The children are wonderful, especially Georgie Henley, and while the story deals with human creatures it is strong.  As the various CGI animals enter (fine though they may be as creations) the tale for this viewer weakens a bit, but that is a personal response.  In general with work like that from Tilda Swinton and Jim Broadbent along with the children, the movie form of Narnia is convincing and enchanting.  Quibbles aside, it is a charming film.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3JQGS7IPMGVXD	Gwyn Releigh	Perhaps one of the greatest pieces of fantasy literature ever written, the Chronicles of Narnia has always been a classic. Since the Fellowship of the Ring entered theaters, it was never a question of whether a Narnia movie would eventually follow, but when. Now that it has arrived, I am perhaps left in awe of the incredibly original masterpiece that the creators of this film managed to give birth to.Long before this version came out, a low-budget version existed, produced by Wonderworks as a small family film. Because of this, when I saw today's Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for the first time I judged it not only from the standpoint of a reader, but from that of someone who already has firmly set in his mind what makes a Narnia movie successful. It is possible that it was this rigid standpoint that so caused the movie to blow me away.The first and most important point I bring to bear is the casting. The four children chosen for the main roles were, in short, amazing. Georgie Henley, the actress for Lcy was expecially surprising, bringing a breath of fresh air to what seemed to be a Dakota Fanning-dominated age. In the older version, all of the actors were very close together in age, primarily because it was harder to work with young children. While there are certainly one or two moments where Henley's youth obviously led to some weak acting, the more realistic ages strengthened interaction between the children and improved characterization.On that note, one of C. S. Lewis's few weaknesses in the first books of the Chronicles of Narnia was a lack of characterization. While the plots were well thought-out and the writing magnificant, it was difficult to truly get to know the characters. I was highly impressed at how well the film portrays its characters, so that after watching the movie once I know those within it far better than I knew them from a lifetime of reading and rereading the book. Kudos to the writers for this.As far as visual effects, in most instances this movie easily matched the Lord of the Rings. This may be explained by the fact that both were done by WETA workshop. In any case, everything from the computer animation of Aslan and the centaurs to the detail of the armor was absolutely stunning.Finally, I can't finish this review without mentioning the soundtrack. The music was simply beyond words... With performances by Tam Linn, Imogen Heap, Lisbeth Scott, and Alanis Morissette hiding at the end, this is one of the few mavies that has compelled me to sit all the way through the credits. Harry Gregson-Williams's music throughout most of the movie was also stunning, and has kept me entranced with the Narnia the film portrays viewing after viewing after viewing.I could honestly go on all day about this movie, but I should probably stop. Let me sum my opinion up by saying that this movie deserved every one of its twelve awards and twenty-seven nominations. Future fantasy movies will have trouble being up to par with this one. As I await Prince Caspian's 2008 arrival with baited breath, I assure you all that this one video's wonder will keep you enchanted for years to come.	5.0	An excellent piece of moviemaking	2006-07-24	8	4	4

Lewis A Mark Johnson Production An Andrew Adamson Film ""The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe.""I read the series last Christmas (my aunt having bought it for me; see my review of the one-volume edition) in anticipation of this movie. The teaser and theatrical trailers inflamed my desire to see this film even further. Read on for the result.The finished product is-what else can I say that hasn't been said already? The acting, visuals and special effects are all top-notch, as expected for such a mammoth production and is sure to please the millions of fans who have read the series. Even those who haven't read it will be thrilled. Liam Neeson (""Schindler's List,"" ""STAR WARS Episode I,"" ""Batman Begins""; see my reviews on all of them) was perfect as the voice of Aslan, the lion (a figurative representation of Jesus Christ). In a recent interview, director Andrew Adamson said, ""If you loved the books, you'll love the movie. If you found Christian meaning in the books, you'll find it in the movie."" This movie has something for everyone: epic battle scenes, humorous moments and heart. The movie's central message isn't lost on me: it is those who love us who lift us up when we are most in need. That is very true in my own life.Mild Caution: The movie is rated PG for battle sequences, all of which is blood-free. Still, these scenes, while exciting, the White Witch's evil minions, though no scarier than the creatures in ""Lord Of The Rings,"" and the bombing of London which opens the film, may prove too intense for very young children. Parents may want to leave their very young offspring under seven years of age at home. A good way to get them introduced to the world of Narnia is to read them the stories, so that they will better understand the film when they see it. I highly recommend this motion picture to Christians and non-Christians alike. You will love this movie. Rated PG for battle sequences and frightening moments."	5.0	Excellent Movie.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2HVL790PBWYTU	"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read"""	"This seven-book effort by C.S. Lewis was the third children's series which I've read and thoroughly enjoyed as a child (the first being L. Frank Baum's Oz books, the second Lloyd Alexander's five novels of Prydain). I'm in my 30s so it's a bit hard to hearken back to that sense of wonder and delight elicited by Mr. Lewis and his creation. What remains is a whiff of nostalgia and a certain recognition that yes, once upon a time, Narnia was a huge, essential piece of my formative childhood.The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an excellent film adaptation of the novel and nicely sets up the series. This opener tells the tale of the four Pevensie children - Peter, the oldest of the quartet; Susan, the maternal, practical older sister; the stubborn, angry Edmund; and the youngest, Lucy. To escape the bombings of WW2 London, the children are sent by their mother to the safety of a professor's rural household. There, involved in a hide & seek game, they go thru a wardrobe and happen upon Narnia, a magical land cursed with a Hundred-Year Winter and inhabited by fauns, centaurs, talking beasts and the seemingly immortal evil White Witch. And inhabited also by Aslan, the wonderful lion and deux-ex-machina of the series. So there -  the stage is set, the personalities introduced, the conflict layed out, and any more details would just be giving the story away.The kid actors are obviously instrumental to the success of the film. William Mosely as Peter and Anna Popplewell as Susan are serviceable. Peter is bland and at times looks awkward as the older Son of Adam; Susan just doesn't have enough to do here, but even in the book, her character is the least filled out. It is the two younger siblings, Lucy and Edmund, as portrayed by Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes, who shine in the spotlight. Children in the viewing audience will doubtless be seeing the film thru Lucy's eyes, more so than thru any of the other characters' herein. Georgie as Lucy carries that burden exceedingly well, emoting with a natural skill more suited for older thespians. She has several scenes with Aslan that were key to the forwarding of the movie, as well as the lending of empathy towards Aslan, and she convincingly pulls them off.  Skalar is an even more mature actor and provides the early conflict in the movie and does it with such ease, I found myself disliking him from the get-go. The grown-ups do a credible job, especially James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus and Jim Broadbent as the benevolent professor. Tilda Swinton could've been more demonstrative in her role as the Witch but her under-the-top acting - her intense stillness, if you will - is explained in great detail in the extra features (the kids' commentary, to be exact).The special effects are very good, which is to be expected, given our current technological state. Aslan, the beavers, and the rest of the talking beasts and fairy tale creatures are realized convincingly. The big battle at the finale is a tad reminiscent of the battles in the Lord of the Rings in terms of the combatants involved, but *shrug* given the make-up of these fantastical movies, what else can you expect but to see orcs, giants and sundry magical uglies? The fight scenes are nothing exceptional, but do remember that these are mostly kids in lead roles and they remain somewhat realistic in their military prowess (I did cringe when Peter cheesily pointed his sword at the Witch, when she entered Aslan's camp and demanded Edmund be given to her). There is a fair amount of violence here: swordplays, arrows hitting their mark, the Witch callously turning Narnians to stone and a grim scene with Aslan on the stone table, being brutalized by the Witch's minions and then, finally, by the Witch herself. All acts aren't overly gory (this film is rated PG) and are depicted with the targeted children in mind and they also happen to be necessary to be true to the books, especially the last scene mentioned.There's been incessant talk (to ad nauseam, I feel) of Lewis's insertions of religious overtones in the film (Aslan, whose father is the Emperor Over the Sea, is obviously meant to be Narnia's version of Jesus; in A Magician's Nephew, a later Narnia installment, there is even a blatant scene involving a forbidden apple). Here's my take:  reading the Narnia Chronicles as a kid, I was quite oblivious to all the religious connotations, references to sons of Adam and daughters of Eve notwithstanding; but I don't for one second believe missing out on the Christian themes herein harmed or benefited me in any way.  Listen,  I endorse everyone's personal right to believe in and follow his/her own God. If parents wish to point out these theological aspects to their kids, that is, of course, totally within their purview.  Lewis's religious references do provide gentle guides to the ways of Christianity. However,  I feel that this offering by C.S. Lewis shouldn't be used as a polarizing tool for Christians and non-Christians and should above all be enjoyed as an excellent adventure book/film for children and adults alike.So, overall, four stars for this dvd. There is an abundance of extra features, which are informative and entertaining. There are so-so outtakes; one filmmaker/adult commentary, another commentary by the kids and director Andrew Adamson; an in-depth ""making of"" documentary, various diaries...all in all, they validate the price of this 2-disc dvd. Why not give it five stars, you ask? Because, in direct comparison with the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series, this film falls a slight notch below. But, having said that, I still cannot wait for the sequel and subsequent films. Go Lucy and Aslan!"	4.0	...HEY, I REMEMBER NARNIA...	2006-04-22	3	3	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2ENJGKZZCVNKK	"Henry-Clyde ""cLaSsIc MoViE lOvEr AnD bOoK rEaDeR"""	"""THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE"" is a glorious example of exceptional production design, excellent cinematography, wonderful special effects and CGI-created characters, incredible fight choreography, swordplay, stunts, great music, dazzling costumes, fantastic characterizations, and, most important of all, the film (for the most part) stays close to the book written by C.S. Lewis. The film is set during World War II. It is the epic story of the four Pevensie children - Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley). They enter the land of Narnia through a mysterious wardrobe. There they do battle with the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton), become friends with a faun named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy), and have dinner with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver (Ray Winstone and Dawn French). To the fans of the books, such as my own humble self, the movie will leave you in complete awe and amazement. To the ones who have not yet read the books, it may confuse you, but it will soon transfix you to the seat. All the acting is magnificent, especially with Georgie Henley, James McAvoy, Tilda Swinton, and the voice talent of Liam Neeson. Each of their characters resonate with such power and personality that it is impossible for you not to be amazed. Henley plays Lucy with a great sense of innocence and courage, having the best performance in the entire film. To me, having read all the books, Lucy is the central character. In my opinion, she is really the only character the audience can totally identify with throughout the series. Director Andrew Adamson seems to notice this, and being one of the script-writers, he uses the other characters, dialogue, and situations to be mainly formed around her role in the film. Maybe that is why Henley is perfect for the part. Let's hope everything stays this way (with her character at least) through the remaining films. McAvoy portrays Mr. Tumnus as a true patriot, fighting for his Narnia. He is ordered to turn in Lucy to the Witch, but Lucy is probably his only friend, and he has high hopes for a peaceful and just Narnia. His character's feelings and beliefs are just a few examples of those of every Narnian exhibited in the film. McAvoy's performance is amazing in its brilliance. Tilda Swinton is magnificently evil, a trait that can only be found in the White Witch, like something chiseled out of ice (pun intended). Her performance is simply perfect. Neeson's voice as Aslan fills the theater with booming presence and deep resonance, yet its own calm and quiet assurance. I never knew that just a voice from such an accomplished actor could inhabit a CGI-created character so well, not to mention the superior animation of the character itself. However, the entire cast is sensational. Keynes, Popplewell, Moseley, Winstone, French, and others are almost as incredible as the film's best performances. The kids are not confused or disoriented about what they must do, they just do it because they know it's the right thing to do. The Witch just oozes with so much evil that even the words I am using in this review cannot describe it. Another cast member that I must mention specifically is Jim Broadbent as Professor Digory Kirke. He is the only character on this side of the wardrobe (besides the kids) that has truly great acting talent. I see the Professor as their Earthly guidance, while Aslan is the perfect counterpart as their Narnian guidance. Both of the characters are the symbol of strength for the children - what binds them together and keeps them true to each other. It is really Peter and Susan's discussion with Professor Kirke that shows them that you do not have to do anything but believe. Listen for Rupert Everett in a small but heroic role as the Fox, watch for James Cosmo as Father Christmas. One last comment on the acting - I am always floored by how well the mannerisms, dialogue, and characters of the four main cast members matches up with their older counterparts. Also surprising is how fantastic the acting talents of the actors and actresses that played the older versions of the children are, even though they do not have much screen time. Definitely one of the greatest sequences in the film is the battle between the Narnians and the forces of the Witch. I adore the action sequences, especially the ones in this final confrontation. And, if you believe in the allegories between the Chronicles of Narnia and the Holy Word of God (like myself), the scene where Aslan is one-on-one with the Witch will have particular meaning for you. A wonderful film.SPECIAL FEATURESBloopersDiscover Narnia Fun Facts (Optional trivia pop-ups throughout film)Audio Commentary with director Andrew Adamson, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie HenleyAudio Commentary with director Andrew Adamson, producer Mark Johnson, and production designer Roger FordAlso Recommended: STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE (1999), LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (2001), LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS (2002), LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING (2003), PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003)THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYONE, LIVING OR DEAD, INVOLVED IN THE PAST, PRESENT, OR FUTURE ""CHRONICLES OF NARNIA"" UNIVERSE."	5.0	A classic story transferred from page to screen!	2008-10-04	0	0	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A457S8SW690NM	hi	"The Chronicles of Narnia is a popular series written by C.S. Lewis. Lewis' books were my faves as a child and were packed with Christian symbolism. Aslan symbolized a Christ figure who was killed and then resurrected. Lucy's little healing potion would be the blood of christ, etc..Although I haven't read the books in 4 or 5 years, I remember really having enjoyed them. I can't say the same about the movie. While it does have some very good apspects, it mostly struggles and is in the end too Disney.Most of the people watching it are watching it for the entertainment and not to see how true it was to the books. Most people, such as little children, wouldn't have noticed the religious aspects or really have cared about them.So, all religious aspects aside, this movie isn't the most entertaining. It's in all fariness boring at times and has plenty of cheesy one liners.First off, the world of Narnia just isn't very well made. It wasn't like I would have expected and the path from the real world to there is lame. They just go in the closet, pass the coats and BOOM! they're in the world of Narnia. Then Lucy meets mister Tubmus and I couldn't help but see some bizarre aspects when seeing him. Just his facial expressions, the way he talks to Lucy, etc.. just makes him out as a ""you know what"". With all of that going on in the world now, I couldn't help but notice how bizarre his movements and actions were. All that aside, the child acting is fair at best. Lucy was good but I could have really seen Dakota Fanning in her role.The White Witch was well made and the acting there was nice. Aslan was the best part of the movie and was stunning (until you see King Kong.). Liam Neeson did a nice job as him also.Aslan was the best part of the movie by far. Then, the beavers and wolves talking were well made and funny and sarcastic at times. As for the rest, well, it was a long ride, very childish and the world of Narnia was just too peaceful for the White Witch and her army to live there.There is no humor despite Disney's harsh efforts at throwing in one liners. In the end, you'll be wanting more and it just wasn't a very good interpretation of the book. It made me feel that it was just too Disney.The PG rating hurts it too. The huge battle scene at the end can't reach its peak like say The Lord of the Rings due to the rating. PG-13 might have helped eliminate the cheesiness.And then when Aslan tells Peter to clean the blood off his sword, um, what blood?Narnia was a fair movie but not at all as good as it said to be. Sure the kids will like it but honestly, I was very dissapointed.And, I just didn't feel that it brought C.S. Lewis' world to life, which is a shame. It's definitely not worth an evening admission, maybe worth a matinee but I'd just wait to see it on DVD. But, for those of you that haven't read the books, it will defintely be a better movie because you won't know how average it is compared to the book.It will leave you dissapointed and the special effects won't blow you away.

I enjoyed the World War II sequence in London and as was the practice, if possible, to move children (the central protagonists) to the countryside which was not the usual target of the Nazis. I loved the slow and methodical buildup as the four Pevensie children eventually discover a secret passage into NARNIA an extra-dimensional Kingdom where good and evil struggle.  If you are unfamiliar with the story it is unfair to say more. The landscapes, colors, music and the overall atmosphere are all very beautiful.

Hoewel ik jarenlang op Christian Artists Seminars de Narnia Chronicles van C.S. Lewis heb verkocht, had ik de allegorische vertellingen rondom het bijbelse evangelie nooit zelf gelezen. Vorige week via de bibliotheek wel de DVD The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in de Nederlandse editie (De Leeuw, De Heks en De Kleerkast) geleend en gisteravond bekeken.De Kijkwijzer aanduiding 12 is terecht, ik zou 'm zoon Johan (7) nu niet willen voorschotelen, omdat m'n eigen nachtrust ook wat waard is. Ook de kritiek op de 'zalvende toon' kan ik wel begrijpen. De dialogen klinken vaak erg belegen, zo niet bekakt. Aan de andere kant is het een sprookje en geen verhaaltje voor op het schoolplein. Als christen ben ik verder sterk bevooroordeeld en merk ik (on)bewust Narnia te toetsen aan de Bijbel. Ik ben dus wel benieuwd hoe een ongelovige deze film beleeft en interpreteert.De visualisatie van de landschappen, het kasteel en sprookjesfiguren als faun 'meneer Tumnus', witte heks Jadis en cast Edmund, Lucy, Peter en Susan zijn sterk, om nog maar niet te spreken van de pratende leeuw Aslan, bevers, vos en wolven. Voor de liefhebbers: momenteel wordt gewerkt aan de verfilming van Prince Caspian, het vierde deel van de Narnia-kronieken. Deze zal begin 2008 in de bioscopen te zien zijn.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A16ALBDRKYUZ15	Hugh Claffey	It seems strange to complain that a three hour movie rushes through its plotlines, but that's how I felt.  The plot is complex, the characters stumble into a new world where animals can talk, winter is permanent and the Queen is malevolent.  So there is a quite a bit to introduce, and the entrance to the new world being in a wardrobe doesn't help.It seems to me that the scriptwriter was concerned to get this one book into one movie, because there are more books in the series.  I felt that if this had got the Lord of the Rings treatment it would have taken at least six hours to tell the story.  Immensely more should have made of  the significance of the thaw which accompanies the return of Aslan.Aslan himself seems quite a remote character.  The author of the book meant Aslan's character to represent Christ, but the movie toned this down to a point where I think it was nearly imperceptible.  Aslan's self-sacrifice, the breaking of the stone and his reappearance were rushed through as it if were a checklist rather than a drama,  compare this with Gandalf's exit and reappearance and I think you see what could have been done  The battle scene was similarly perfunctory.Unfortunately the main actors were weak, the story of their discovery of the wardrobe had a very Enid Blyton feel - complete with the strange adults.  I once saw a hilarious satire on Enid Blyton called `Five Go Mad on Mescaline' and this kept going through my mind when these very English children plodded through the story.The actor who plays the Queen exemplified the weakness of the movie - she seemed to me neither evil enough nor conflicted enough. In the battle she drove a chariot pulled by two polar bears - the cold metaphor, I guess - however the thing  looked lumbering and ridiculous.  In general the animals were simulated/photographed very well, however I think when you mix human and animated characters, the main attention goes to the humans, and in this case they couldn't hold that attention.Overall I think this movie might have worked better if it was completely animated, if more time had been taken to follow the story rather than rush through it. And it should have been more honest about whether it was trying to relate the Christian theme or not.	3.0	Rushed metaphors, weak actors	2006-01-28	12	3	9
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A34R39IAPS2OEE	Humble Pi	Who wouldn't want to dwell in a world where animals talk, legendary creatures roam the lands, doing right is honored, and humans are given royal crowns?I first heard of C.S. Lewis and his Chronicles of Narnia in the early 1990's. I have not read any of the seven books, but perhaps I will in the near future. I am thankful that director Andrew Adamson wanted to make Narnia as real as possible; and he, along with the producers, had agreed to make a film that faithfully tells C.S. Lewis' story of courage, hope, faith, and love.Director of photography Donald McAlpine and Production Designer Roger Ford have wonderfully captured stunning imagery and created a detailed world of Narnia. Both photography of and production pieces for Narnia are absolutely beautiful. The visual effects and CGIs are incredibly real, especially the character Aslan. Together with the cool visual effects, make-up, costumes, and prop pieces, what makes this film special is the charm of the four young cast members (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley) and the enchanting music score by Harry Gregson-Williams.The packaging of the 4-Disc Extended Edition is great. I can actually remove the discs from the case without bending them! I wished other studios had DVD cases as well designed as this one.DISC 1:  Reviewers are saying the extended version contains about 8 additional minutes of inserted scenes. I suggest that if you already own the 1-Disc DVD, get this Extended Edition.  If you own the 2-Disc Special Edition, then you must decide what interests you the most.  If I had owned the 2-Disc set, I still would have purchased the 4-Disc Extended Edition because I enjoy the behind-the-scenes, movie-making features. Whether you think the extended scenes are worth the additional cost, you can at least use the $10 rebate if you own previous Narnia DVD releases from Disney and Walden Media.  Decide soon, because this 4-Disc set will be going back to Disney's vault on January 31 2007.The two sets of commentaries are absolutely enjoyable!  I have listened to both. I think the Kids' & Director Commentary is one of my all time favorites! The re-telling of their experiences on set in front of and behind the cameras made me laugh several times and provided a lot of fun information about their performance and directing challenges.  Definitely worth listening to!Bloopers is another fun featurette to watch. In the Director's & Kids commentary, the kids talk about some of the bloopers that are shown in this (and only this) featurette. It goes by quick, so be alert when viewing it.DISC 2: In the Creatures Of The World menu (within Creatures, Lands and Legends), or in Creating Creatures menu (within Creating Narnia\Evolution Of An Epic), you will notice an icon of the wardrobe under Centaurs.  Clicking on the icon will toggle the background of the menu (between colored illustration and pencil sketched illustration). You will also get a different feature presentation of each creature.  Nice! With the colored background, clicking on a creature's name will start a short presentation about that creature from one of the Narnia books. With the pencil sketched background, clicking on a creature' name will launch a behind-the-scenes presentation of the creature for the movie.In the Evolution Of An Epic menu (within Creating Narnia), move your pointer to the chair on the left and click on the ornament icon on the chair.  It will launch a behind-the-scenes segment of Skandar and Turkish Delight. Yum!I like Cinematic Storytellers, where you get interesting perspectives of the making of the movie from: costumer designer, Weta workshop designer, creature designer, production designer, cinematographer, editor, music composer, and producer.DISC 3: Finally, we are treated with a 75 minute feature of the life of C.S. Lewis.  It is a very interesting and touching first person narrative of his life. I found it helpful in my understanding of the motivation, purpose, and creative resources behind the writing of Chronicles of Narnia.  We also get interesting perspectives from his stepson, Douglas Gresham.  I am amazed how C.S Lewis' life and writings still impact us today!DISC 4: Ahh, more stuff about the making of the movie!  I love it! Your choices are: Visualizing The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe; Anatomy Of A Scene: Behind The Battle; and Art Of Narnia.In Visualizing The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, you will experience the movie with pop-up inserts of several key film members explaining the scenes.  Basically it is a video commentary of the film. Very nice.  I think some of the contents are from Disc 2, but you get much more!  It reminds me of what HD-DVD and Blu-ray discs will or should provide to the viewer.  Imagine watching the movie in commentary mode which displays a horizontal split-screen or pop-up of the cast and crew discussing the scenes.The motion picture, The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, is an instant classic and has become one of my all time favorites. Although it contains violence and images that may not be appropriate for younger children, its lack of gore and foul-language is a plus. I wish Hollywood would get the message that movies like this can be very profitable (not only economically).Thank you Andrew Adamson, Perry Moore, Mark Johnson, K.C. Hodenfield, Philip Steuer, Douglas Gresham, and many others who brought this story to life. Because of this film, I have experienced the enchanted land of Narnia more than once.	5.0	Instant Classic!	2007-01-02	2	2	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3USRUCHAOC3MT	"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff"""	"Allow me to approach this review in this way, which is as question and answers.IS THE MOVIE FAITHFUL TO THE BOOK?  Reviewers and viewers answer the question differently.  In a sense, both are right.  The movie is faithful to the book as far as basic plot, characters, and atmosphere.  There are changes made that are not in the book, but these changes are usually for the purpose of a) helping the viewer understand the historic setting, such as the movie's beginning, or b) adding to the entertainment value of the movie, adding humor (e.g. the beavers) or suspense (I don't remember the children riding a piece of ice in the original, though it has been well over 25 years since I read the book).IS THE MOVIE SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN?  If and only if a parent accompanies them.  This movie lives up to the PG rating.  Other reviewers pointed out there is plenty of scariness in the movie, especially the battle scene.  But I don't think there is anything that would be overly traumatic if the child is accompanied by the parent.  (By the way, I believe that the parent should be with the child in viewing any movie or any TV show.)IS THE MOVIE A ""CHRISTIAN MOVIE""?  Disney making a Christian movie?  Seriously, there are themes that a Christian would recognize in the movie, which would need to be there to be faithful to the book.  These allusions are such that a non-Christian would miss them, without losing appreciation for the story.  This is not like ""The Passion.""  However, a Christian can use the film in witnessing to unbelievers, pointing out the parallels between Aslan and Jesus.Allow me to make a few other comments.  I think Tilda Swinson did a good job with the character.  One reviewer used the term underplayed.  In some stories, the villain is more interesting, memorable, and maybe even likeable than the hero, and Swinson's performance keeps this from happening.  I also loved the beavers.I am looking forward to the release of Prince Caspian, the next of the series.  If it is half as good as this movie, it would be very good."	5.0	Well done, visually pleasing, adaption for all.	2006-11-28	19	18	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A24I3BMB9JZC7O	"Ingrid Heyn ""No man is an Iland, intire of it..."	"For those who love the Narnia Chronicles, written by one of the twentieth century's finest writers, C.S. Lewis, the story of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe needs no introduction. Rather than belabour the plot, I would like to focus purely upon this film in terms of the elements that make it so appealing.First of all, the story itself is a wonderful one. C.S. Lewis was one of those writers who wrote genuinely ORIGINAL stories. Of course he incorporated existing story elements, but he did not rely solely upon them. Running through his stories at all times is the magical gold thread of intelligent creativity. (His turn of phrase is wonderful, both in his fiction and non-fiction.) The director has been remarkably scrupulous in keeping to the text, particularly in comparison with film versions of other books.Secondly, the characters are not one-dimensional. The four children, as presented both in the book and in the film, are beautifully fleshed out as real and imperfect beings, but one cannot help delighting in them. Even Edmund, whose greed blinds him to the selfishness of his choice to betray his brother and sisters to the White Witch, is a sympathetic character as he develops and as he is faced with the consequences of what he has done.Thirdly, the acting in this film is frankly superb. Tilda Swinton is marvellously well controlled in her portrayal of the White Witch. This is a role that would be so terribly easy to overdo, but Ms Swinton knows full well the remarkable effectiveness of subtlety. My two adorable little nieces were utterly impressed by her - evidence that children are not blind to subtle and superb acting. The children were excellently played - what a treat to see that there do exist children who CAN act. In particular, the role of Lucy was extraordinarily effective, but Peter was extremely well played, Edmund was superb in his sullenness and later his true sorrow, and Susan was charming as a girl trying to be sensible, taking too much responsibility upon herself and feeling the pressure of her care for others. And Mr Tumnus the fawn! Wonderfully done! Also magnificent is Liam Neelson's voicing of Aslan, the Lion himself. The smaller roles (the wonderfully portrayed beavers, the fox, the wolves, Father Christmas, the Professor, etc.) are all excellently done; I can only give praise.Fourthly, the battle scenes are extremely well choreographed. They convey a sense of the realness of what is at stake, rather than prettying up the whole business.Fifthly, magnificent cinematography. It is truly beautiful to watch (even though I do feel the snow looks a little fake... but in all honesty, this is a very minor consideration).Sixthly, extremely good special effects. I remain amazed by the image of the fawn, by the centaurs, by the Lion, by all the creatures.This is quite a long film, but I did not feel it was too long at all. It moved beautifully, and there were some very vivid moments, such as the dancing of the pipe by Mr Tumnus when he first decides to capture Lucy for the White Queen. Magical indeed is the effect - the feeling of drowsiness, the wonderful and strange music, the dancing flames.There are a few things which I'd have liked to see improved. Firstly, there were some musical elements which I feel did not work. For instance, the opening theme - very Celtic, very  breath-in-the-voice singing - seemed to me to have absolutely nothing to do with this film.Secondly, the director seemed not to care that British children of this class and this period did not give each other soap-opera hugs. Once or twice would have been perfectly adequate for such hugs in the film, to express extraordinary situations. But there were too many of these hugs, when a stiff upper lip and a carefully directed sense of ""I feel more than I choose to show, because it simply isn't done"" would have been so much more effective. I'd have ditched the last two hugs at least - or ditched the earlier two and kept the last one.But really, these are minor quibbles. I was enchanted with the film, and I hope to see more of the Narnia Chronicles make it to the screen, done as well as this one.One more thing: I'm puzzled as to why the editorial review above could mention (presumably in all seriousness) the superiority of the Harry Potter influence. None of the Harry Potter films are graced with such fine acting in the children's parts as is this film; none of the Harry Potter films feature originality to anywhere near the same extent as this film (understandably - Rowling is a competent writer, whereas C. S. Lewis is a great writer); and finally the extremely well-marketed Harry Potter phenomenon is irrelevant with regards to this film.Enjoy this film. I was charmed by it at the cinema, and I shall have no hesitation is purchasing this DVD set as soon as it's released."	5.0	The enchantment of Narnia - from page to screen	2006-03-14	23	22	1

I was addicted to it, i saw it 7 times and i owned tons of Narnia stuffs. I think that it was the greatest movie ever. The acting is amazing, the story is unforgettable, the scenary is breathtaking and the music is perfect.During World War II, 4 childrens, whose name is Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy Pevensie was being evacuated from London. They lived on the countryside, in a huge mansion, owned by an old professor. There, they found an old wardrobe, which lead them to the land of Narnia. Narnia, a magical land, enslaved by an evil White Witch for 100 years. However, there is a prophecy, that 2 sons of Adam and 2 daughters of Eve will come to defeat the White Witch and restore peace to Narnia. With the help of Aslan, the Lion God of Narnia, a destiny will be fulfilled and the chronicles will begin...A must see movie of all times.	5.0	A Must See - 4 Thumbs Up!!	2006-02-08	5	5	0

The storyline was mostly true to the book and the casting was almost perfect (Lucy being perfect, the White Witch was a bit iffy).The best thing of all though, is not something IN the movie, but something that was left out! The ubiquitous and awful Disney songs that have plagued their movies (even the good ones)all these years. To whomever fought to keep them out, I thank you!Some may think the movie a little violent for children, but the books are actually more graphic in this respect and besides, we who grew up on a diet of WWII, Cowboys and Indians and even Tom and Jerry all turned out OK.I have the movie pre ordered and will have no hesitation letting my 3 and 5 year olds watch it.	5.0	Disney surprise!	2006-03-12	15	15	0

It's a lot like Lord of the Rings, but more for children aka no blood.  I read the C.S. Lewis series as a kid and also watched the original movies.  I was shocked to say the least that Disney managed to make the movie so close to the book that it was as if I was reading the book all over again.  All the characters were enchanting, the boys were strong and during the battle scene it was ovbious the love they felt for each other in a manly way.  I loved Lucy, but I felt after reading the reviews that Susan was overlooked.  Her witty, yet sweet performance has me wanting to see more of her.  I hope they make all the books into movies.  As for the religious aspect of this movie that people are talking about...for me there is none.  Narnia is a magical land ruled by a ""deep magic"" and for those of us who still believe in it that is all that matters.  This movie of course does have some scary parts, no worse than Barbie: Magic of Pegasus and the battle scene is violent, but all in all a great movie for any child to see.  I would suggest reading the book before seeing the movie and also strongly suggest that parents are with their children at all times when they first see the movie as they will have questions.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2KWQ64TRHB3YH	Israel Drazin	C. S. Lewis was a superb writter. I wrote reviews of all of his Narna books. This film is delightful. It is a pleasure to watch all of the characters, especially the youngest child Lucy who is the most charming. She discovers the magical world of Narnia, which can be entered by going to the back of a wardrobe. The country is suffering a perpetual winter because it is being ruled by the cruel self centered white witch. Fortunately, there is a prophecy that the great lion Aslan will come and defeat the white witch (think of the evils in our world and the prophecy of a coming messiah). He will be aided by four humans who will rule over Narnia. The four are Lucy, her sister, and two brothers. The book and film can be viewed on two levels. People can take the fable at face value and simply enjoy it or they can search for the religious sumbolism that C. S. Lewis intentionally inserted. Either way, it is a delight.	5.0	Excellent film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages on two levels	2011-07-12	1	1	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A251Z9UBB4YRQ7	J. Aborlleile	I first saw this movie when I was about 7 years old. Since then, I have seen it twice more. I really like this film, but would not recommend it to very young children, as there are somewhat unsettling creatures in a few scenes.  The reason I chose to rate it as a four-star movie instead of a five-star movie is that I had the distinct pleasure of reading the book it was based on, which was much better. If you see this movie and like it, I urge you to read The Chronicles Of Narnia, by C. S. Lewis. There are seven books in all, this movie being based on the second.On another note, there were two more movies made: Prince Caspian,(based on the fourth book,) and Voyage of the Dawn Treader, (based on the fifth book.) These two films are not as good as this one, and therefore I give you two warnings. The first is for people who have read the books. These two movies are much more different from the book than this movie is. The basic plot is the same, but the little details and events that make the book worth wile are absent from the movies, especially the last and most recent, Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The second warning is for everyone. The last two movies are much darker than the first. For example, this movie has a war and evil witch. Prince Caspian has the same. However, in this film, it is bloodier and more evil, which is a shame because Prince Caspian and Voyage of the Dawn Treader are some of the most facinating books in the series.	4.0	Great movie!

The only real differences are that the movie goes into more detail than the book in places, but it always works.

The story is fased paced and will have you on the edge of your seat. The charactors are all great and memrable I loved everyone from the evil witch to Aslen the lion. the direction was great and the visuals were outstanding. I would say it's not as good as Harry Potter or Lord of the rings but it's up there as the best fantasy movie that ytou could watch over and ovver again.

If you did not read the book and you are a fan of fantasy, fairy tales, and all that go with this genre then you should love it too.This is a great story made into an excellent film.  Christian themes are incorporated and the beauty of sacrifice is exposed.  Many church groops took field trips to see this film as it is said to be an allegory for the new testament.  You don't have to be religous to appreciate the film however, remember it is a childrens story which simply provides positive ideals that happen to be similar to the ideals christ set forth in the new testament.  Ideals like love, honor, sacrifice, and so on.Great for any child over the age of five and great for the child in all us adults.  (I'm 28 years old)Finally the movie is made and distributed by Disney ( in association with Walden Media) who has done a great job with the special effects as they did with Pirates of the Caribean.All around this is a great film for all, and one of the must see movies of 2005.	5.0	Disney does it again!!	2005-12-18	5	3	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AYJ22I3NM8ZFR	"James Forsyth ""www.jamesforsyth.net"""	"Some past reviewers have made comparisons (or stated their preference) between this film and Lord of the Rings.  With this film - and book - I found it easier to take in a bit-sized portion, rather than a multi-course al-a-carte meal that is far more difficult to digest.  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, having an appropriately designated PG rating, is great for kids.  The mildly scary parts - for example when Aslan is being led to his death - are not too needlessly drawn out.Part of the beauty of this film is the casting of the children.  C.S. Lewis's approach to children was one that, in my opinion, produces healthy and well-rounded adults.  In his autobiography ""Surprised by Joy"" he discusses the lack of ""play"" during his schooling.  This is different from organised games, it simply means ""play"".  It is the sort of ""play"" that went on to produce the Narnia classics so many children continue to enjoy today, both in book form and film.The same idea of ""play"" is what essentially happens in this story.  Four bored children attempt to relieve their boredom through an organised game of hide and seek.  This is until they find a far better diversion: the wardrobe.  No organisation by adults - just pure fun.The underlying message of the substitutionary atonement of Christ in the death and resurrection of Aslan is not lost in this film.  It is obvious to anyone with any knowledge of this essential theme of the Gospel."	5.0	Children at play	2006-06-28	4	1	3

I am very proud of Disney for a job well done.  Yes they changed a little bit of the story but the spirit that runs through this adventure is the same.  Where was all the blood and guts, sex and profanity?  There wasn't any.  Do you mean a movie can gross millions and be pure and clean?  Disney took a chance and found out.  I wonder if Hollywood realizes that people are willing to lay out their hard earned dollars for something of value, instead of waisting it on something cheap with no value.  It doesn't take a genius to see the dollar signs they have been missing.  I saw this film seven times in the theater and will recieve the dvd in a day or two.

I'm sick of people saying things like: ""These kids go off to war with absolutely no training, blah blah blah..."" LOOK! The message is, God (Aslan) can use anybody to do anything. You don't have to have a military background when you have God on your side.2. I saw one person refer to the juice of the fire flower that Father Christmas gives Lucy as ""kool aid."" First of all, this ignorant person said that Father Christmas didn't look anything like the popular portrayals, and they're right! THAT is because the way he is shown in the movie is the ENGLISH & BRITISH portrayal of Santa Clause (Father Christmas). (It would be weird to have an American Santa Clause in an English setting). SECOND, the ahem...""kool aid"" is supposed to represent the Blood of Christ and Father Christmas told her it would cure ANY injury, and that's what the Blood of Christ does, it cleanses & heals us.3. THE COMPARISONS TO LOTR... Stop it already! Lord of the Rings was battles, wars blood...blah blah blah. Narnia is pure story and if you absolutely HAVE TO HAVE continuous war or battle scenes and can't handle watching a real story, then here's a solution: WATCH LOTR!4. When you, yourself come to a sexual conclusion of the circumstances between Lucy and Mr. Tumnus.....then who REALLY is the pervert? Is that the kind of conclusion YOU draw from this innocent setting? That is not the way C.S. Lewis or Andrew Adamson intended.5. The people say that they can't stand watching a movie with Christian allegories...here's another solution: DON'T WATCH THEM! Nobody is forcing you to watch this movie! Christians (like myself) love the fact that C.S. Lewis had the guts to write it in this sin filled world and Andrew Adamson had the guts to direct it (in which a way, I might add, that didn't slam a Bible in your face). If you don't like Christian themes, don't watch it.Other than that, the movie is fabulous. Aslan looks amazing, every single actor did a fantastic job and I can't wait for the next 6 to come out. Prince Caspian is next but, I'm waiting for the Silver Chair."	5.0	Awesome	2006-02-19	16	7	9

Is it really worth the price to have on blu ray.Well if your like me and you enjoy terrific looking blu's with some great audio then yes,yes,yes.I'm thinking of some of the better looking blu rays I own and watched and I'm thinking of some of the greats in the video quality like Swordfish yes Swordfish if you enjoy the best blu ray quality than Swordfish in my opinion is probly the best in terms of video quality.Lets see then there is I Robot,Kingdom Of Heaven,Flyboys,Troy,Blood Diamond to name a few.All these I consider to be some of if not the best demo video material for Blu ray disc.Now we have Narnia and Narnia meets or beats any of the above stated blu disc for quality,the the video is what you expect a ""HD"" disc to look like plain and simple.There is so many brilliant colors and nice epic settings in this movie and Disney did one fine job for the blu ray realease.The audio has one of my personel favorite audio tracks the 5.1uncompressed and its done well here also.I know its alot for me to go on typing about here considering Narnia isn't my favorite genre of films but this is a blu ray that does indeed deserve the respect."	5.0	Probly the best looking Blu ray	2008-05-14	1	0	1

Schlierman ""milojthatch"""	"As a child, I always loved the book ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", but never read the other books.  I started reading the books all at once finaly about a few years ago, and totaly fell in love with them.  So after tollerating three years of ""Ring"" movies, I had mixed fellings when I heard that C.S. Lewis was finaly getting a movie.  But as I loved the books so much, I had some hopes.  As the time got closer and I saw more of the film in trailers or what not, it started to intrest me more.  But after a lot of just bad films the last few years that I had high hopes for, I thought it best not rest my hopes on a new movie now.  And then after the mind blowing ""Batman Begins"", I thought I had seen about the best that 2005 had to offer at the movies.  But when I finaly saw ""Narnia"", all I could say was ""Batman who?""  It was so amazing!  I loved how they kept true to the books, adding elements from all seven books a a whole to the film.  (Such as the name ""Jadis"" is never used in the book ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"", but they still use it in the movie.  It is writen that is the Witches name in another book.)  And I loved how they had something for everyone, how they stayed true the the Christianity of the book, and yet even if you don't belive in Christ, you could still get into it.  The music was so wonderful, and I loved that for the most part, it was all new actors basicaly.  I fully enjoyed the film and highly recomend it to anyone who loves a good movie.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3UW4VWJUBKUL2	Jass	"My wife and I watched this interpretation of the novel and we were pretty disappointed. If you are a huge fan of the novels and are the type (like us) that dislike complete rewrites, I dont think you'll like this movie as much as someone who never read the book. Its done as thought the writers and director never actually read the book or, at least, are not fans. Some of the small changes and omissions are understandable (size of the fawns, finding of the wardrobe, just how bad Ed wants the Turkish Delight, etc), no problem, many movies do this, but there was no reason to reorder, rewrite, or completely makeup, scenes from the book. Some examples of this. The White Witch was toned-down. Because of the rewrites, you just dont get the same feel that the Witch is not just a villian, but evil. You also loose in this translation how Edmund sells his siblings out and why he really resents them (Especially Peter). In this version Ed is ""kindly"" portrayed too much as a victim (or dupe) that you are supposed to feel sorry for, instead of someone who needs redemption because he, initially, helped the Witch, deliberately, out of spite for his brother and sisters.That all being said... We dont hate it completely and if you can seperate the book from the movie (or never read the book) its not as bad. The cast did very well and they did bring the characters out. The movie is a decent length, however the scenes do feel very rushed and some forced. The bloodless battle was fine with us, not very realistic, but makes it more for younger children. Visually it was very well done and we loved seeing the world really come to life. They left in the ""key"" parts, such as Aslan's sacrifice, but again, changed the scene that shouldve followed after, for no good reason we can think of.We really hope there is a extended version with missing footage that can convince us to buy the DVD later. Lastly, as fans of the books, we hope that if the same writers and director do the next one (if there is), they stick to the book, but the damage is already done here. Other reviews express some concerns, but for authors reasons, still gave it 5 out of 5, we cant bring ourselves to do that, even if we can forgive the deviations from the novel, 3 of 5 stars."	3.0	Visually wonderful but NO reason for the changes made...	2006-02-25	15	8	7
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1X0L2JLAWJVFM	"Jay Lesiger ""jay in chelsea"""	"Perhaps my response might have been different had I read the Lewis book as a child--or perhaps if the film had been any good. But I didn't, and it isn't. Barely registers as an epic, considering how cheap the film looks and how poorly acted and directed it is. The four child actors perform as though they were rejects from a road company of THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and Tilda Swinton's Queen borders on total boredom. But neither the direction nor the script is of any help. If one more character shouted ""Wait!"" before the fall of a dagger...But what is most shocking is the lack of audio or visual treats in this overlong, slow-moving piece. The first hour or so lacks any visual impact whatsoever; the interminable repetition of the children morphing from wardrobe to the same snow-covered forest shows an amazing lack of imagination (and budgetary restrictions?), and the much-vaunted sound design shows little depth or interest. Several sequences actually seem to use long-retired ""process"" shots (see almost any of Hitchcock's films to see the right way to use such visuals). While the visuals somewhat improve during the long second hour, the film fails to engage on any level, sinking into one boring battle cliche after another. While I was unfamiliar with Lewis' Christian allusions, the film does not present them in interesting ways, so it fails even as a religious epic. All in all, not worth the time or trouble."	1.0	Dull, wooden, cheap-looking epic	2006-07-05	45	13	32

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2FSAMMVMTSAPF	JCrouch3	"The Chronicles of Narnia: the Loin, the Witch, and the WardrobeSometimes there are those movies where you have seen the preview and you know you're going to absolutely hate it. Theres always a weekend in every month where my family has a going out to the movies day. Well my little brother got to choose our movie this particular weekend and this was exactly what I thought. I saw the preview to The Chronicles of Narnia and jumped straight to the conclusion that this would be another one of those kid movies with horrible effects and no storyline at all. I even brought my ipod to play games during the movie to keep myself occupied. Well I was completely mistaken. This movie takes you on a big adventure with a great crossing of animation and actuality, young actors and actresses that put on a great performance, and an amazing plot based much on Christianity. This is definitely one of those movies where you would rather hold your number one till the credits show up.First off, most of the time I hate movies that try to combine reality and animation. Movies like Space Jam, and Who Framed Rodger Rabbit just extremely annoy me. But the quality of work that producers Adamson and Minkowski put together resembles very much to the animation of Jurassic Park and Transformers. The animation is so realistic you never really notice throughout the film that half the characters are just CGI and voices. I also enjoyed the different types of creatures that were created in this movie. Its not your average griffins and dragons type of creatures. These creators actually go out and make their own original types of animals, some being normal animals we are used to, but there are also some creative new animals I have never seen before that really impressed me. You do not usually see that in films like this. The scenery is beautiful and also well used with the computer characters. I am pretty sure some of it is animation as well, but honestly I would not be able to tell you which is fake or which is actual land. The way the actors and animation characters move and interact with the scenery is almost identical. This is usually my big pet peeve with crossing animation and reality movies, but these guys have obviously put in the hours to make it right. Overall, I am greatly impressed with the visual effects in this film.Another thing that shocked me in this film were the young actors. They all seemed to be new, I had never seen them before in any other films. Im not completely sure if they have done previous work, but it definitely resembled it. You can tell this movie expected a lot out of these kids and without a doubt pulled it off. They are also quite comical in some scenes when they are first introduced to the ""fantasy"" creatures.  Another plus is that the actors and actresses are all british. This just makes them more fun to watch when they talk in my opinion. Now obviously they are no Leo DiCaprio's or Halle Berry 's, but they really put on a show with this film. Again, overall I really enjoyed the performance by this fresh group of kids.The final part of this film that really made it a keeper was the plot. Being a Christian this movies  showed me that you can tell God's story in so many different ways. The antagonist in the movie extremely portrays the devil in many scenes. There are times where she will tempt the main characters with either food or power. She makes one of the protagonists (Edmond) almost betray his own family just for the glory and power this evil character offers him.  After realizing what he has done he falls into the great chains of sin. Later after committing sin, Edmond is released back to his family after the main protagonist (Aslyn) offers his life as a trade. This act completely resemble Jesus dying on the cross for forgiveness of our sins. But knowing the Gospel, we soon find out of his resurrection to come back and defeat the evil force that is hungry for all the power she can get. You also have to give it up to the actors for there bravery in being a part of such a big production. It takes a lot of courage to share your faith in front of the media like this, and I applaud them for it. The best part about this plot is that it is not advertised as a Christian based film. So many people who don't know Christ have gone to see it unknowing of its meaning. So I am greatly impressed with its sort of secret type of evangelism, because honestly thats what Christianity is all about. Spreading the word of God to others. The workers behind this film have done an exceptional job of this. You cant help but give these guys a big pat on the back.So for all you people who are just like me, taking a look at this preview and automatically thinking this is just another poorly made kids movie, you're greatly mistaken. Though I am sure your kids will greatly enjoy it as well. It has it all, action, drama, comedy, love, you name it. This film takes you on an wild adventure, and will amaze you with the story it has to tell regardless of your age honestly. The cross animation with reality is incredible, these brand new actors and actresses put on such a great performance, and the plot based on Christianity is purely brilliant. I was definitely blown away at the theaters and couldn't wait for the DVD to come out. I also have no doubt that this movie  has done great evangelistic work and maybe even lead some people to the Lord Jesus Christ."	4.0	Complete Review	2011-02-06	0	0	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2GO2CH7EP1TYH	Jeanie Robinson-Pownall	"As a Narnia fan from way back I swore I would never see this movie because I did not want to see Narnia through someone else's imagination.  I wavered when both my sister and my mother gave it a thumbs up.  C. S. Lewis was still alive when our family first became acquainted with Narnia.  We were in England for the summer and an auntie gave us The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, which my folks took turns reading read outloud to us. Of course, we ended up devouring all seven of the novels.If you are a fan of Narnia and deviations will bother you, then this is probably a good one to skip.  There are many deviations, the biggest one being the overall tone.  The circumstances are simply not as dire as in the book.  This is a kinder, gentler Narnia, and is perfect for the age range of the targeted viewers.  I found myself viewing it as a stunningly beautiful film with a plot I already knew.  By removing most of the violence, gore, and scariness the producers have given birth to a wonderful film for children.I think it is a mistake to cram all of the events in a novel into a two+ hour film.  Instead, the script writers and producers chose to do selected bits of the novel, and to do them very well.One of the tenets of my childhood, which I hope I have instilled in my own children, is ""the worst thing you can do is betray someone who is trusting you.""  This, and many other ideals come out in this film.In the dedication to his godchild Lucy, C.S. Lewis expressed his regret that Lucy was too old for fairy tales and commented that ""children grow faster than books."" He went on to express his wish that Lucy read and enjoy The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe when she became old enough for fairy tales again.

It is not perfect, but the movie is a far more faithful adaptation than I ever expected from anything associated with Disney. The movie is charming. The kids put in very good performnaces. Aslan was well done in CGI. Neesan provided a very kingly voice. Swinton is good as the White Witch.The DVD had a pop-up feature. Fun facts about Lewis and Narnia pop up in little balloons throughout the movie. Some of the facts were incongruous with what was happening with the movie. The fact that Lewis was very concerned with good manners in children appeared too many times. However, it was an okay feature. I would give this movie 4 1/2 stars. I would knock a 1/2 star off because I disagree with some of the minor changes, but again I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and am very impressed with the final result.

I myself have nt read this book so therefore I had no idea  as to wht I was in for.The story is very hard to understand if you hadn't read ay of  C.S. Lewis' books.  As the movie went on, I kept asking myself questions as to why certain things were happening but yet there was no reasoning for it.The movie is a lot like the ""Lord of the Rings"" series.  The story follows the same basic system.  There are a lot of mythical creatures in this movie as well as talking animals.The special effects were by far the best part of this movie.  It's the reason why I gave this movie 2 stars.  If not for the effects, I would have given it just one star.I think young kids would have a hard time with this movie.  This movie, in my opinion, does not make you want to root for any one character.  Yes, you hope that the kids do triumph but that is about it.  You know that the lion will live.If it's fantasy you want, along wth a story that is easy to follow, I'd highly recommend the movie ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"""	2.0	a very unexplainable movie	2005-12-09	30	7	23

A grass-roots marketing campaign (to encourage church group bookings) has begun in the hopes of potentially tapping the ""Passion of the Christ"" audience along with the hordes of Tolkien and Lewis fans. I didn't have a lot of interest in the books as a child, so I thought the odds were better that I'd like this version.The film starts off well, hurling us into the London blitz that necessitates the removal of the four Pevensie children (Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy - William Moseley, Skandar Keynes, Anna Popplewell, and Georgie Henley, respectively) to the countryside. This not only motivates a crucial change in their lives, it delineates their conflicts with one another nicely.Their new home is a glum manor owned by Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent) and run by the dour Mrs. MacReady (Elizabeth Hawthorne). It's an empty, cold, resolutely adult world, and the Pevensies do their best to stick together and circumvent the many rules of the house. It's during a cautious game of hide-and-seek that tiny Lucy hides in a massive wardrobe and discovers a portal to another chilly, beautiful realm.Narnia, a fantasyland populated by fauns, centaurs, dwarves, and griffins (among many other creatures) has been thrown into a state of ""always winter, never Christmas"" by the White Witch (a perfectly cast Tilda Swinton), an icily regal despot who seduces new followers and turns dissenters to stone. What her magic cannot accomplish, her roaming wolf packs will.But change is in the air. The true ruler of Narnia, a mighty lion named Aslan, has returned and his supporters are gathering strength once more. It seems that the children are the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy that four humans will one day reclaim their thrones and restore Narnia to freedom. The White Witch will stop at nothing to keep her power over the land, and the clouds of war begin to cast their shadows. It's up to the children to lead Narnia to victory and freedom.Until recently, the fantasy stamp was the seal of doom for a movie. The remainder bins at your local video store are stuffed with attempts to court this audience - ""Dragonslayer"", ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"", ""Fire and Ice"", ""Dungeons and Dragons"", and ""Red Sonja"", just to name a few. Previous to the ""Rings"" trilogy, the two moderate successes that come to mind might be ""Conan The Barbarian"" and ""Willow"" - neither of which inspire much affection.This genre is fraught with pitfalls, and ""Narnia"" is very much a mixed bag. As in ""The Lion King"", it's a little frustrating to watch as an entire world waits passively for The Right One(s) to show up and save them all. The plot is a Christian allegory, so viewers come to the film expecting a central death and resurrection at its heart. Unfortunately, giving Lucy as well as Aslan the power to breathe life into the dead weakens the consequences of the overall conflict.Not surpisingly for a Disney picture, the film feels uncomfortable with the responsibilities of life and death in war. Peter's first slaying of a wolf guard - his emergence as the leader of Aslan's followers - feels more accident than deliberate choice, letting him off the hook for the kill. While I'm not a fan of gratuitous gore, the battles in ""The Lord of the Rings"" were in the province of adults - they had the proper impact, a true sense of dread and loss. It's unsettling, then, in ""Narnia"" to see small children cheerfully become proficient with weapons. The bloodless battles creep uncomfortably close to a massive version of ""Capture the Flag"". We're supposed to cheer when soaring griffins dump boulders on the enemy, but it's precisely what we saw the Germans do to England in the opening. It's tough to sympathize strongly with one army or another, as mythical creatures and animals substantially populate both sides. Are cheetahs ""good"", and white tigers ""evil""? With the hideous Orcs, it was much clearer to know where you stood.It's tricky stuff to visually interpret this sort of material - there's a degree of built-in tackiness to surmount. You think 'fantasy art', what usually comes to mind are illustrations that grace heavy metal album covers and the sides of 70s vans. With a few exceptions, Peter Jackson's films escaped this almost entirely, creating a rich, evocative word tastefully. ""Narnia"", however, is not as fortunate. What may be acceptable on the printed page can feel contrived, illogical or downright ridiculous on the screen. We watch chubby beavers waddle about in full battle regalia, and the White Queen in her polar-bear-drawn battle coach looks like an 80s vodka ad by way of Frank Frazetta.The effects work is uneven. Some characters, such as the griffins, are startlingly well-visualized, others feel rushed or cobbled together from warehouse leftovers. Aslan himself is well constructed but a bit overworked, his mane simulations flapping to distraction, his facial animation constantly pulsing. The design work is accomplished, but not distictive.The film is overly long, and lacks in charm as well as heft. The beaver sidekicks come off as a last-minute ""humor pass"" to the script in an attempt to lighten a fairly joyless enterprise. Lucy weeps so often for her fallen friends that it begins to lose its effect. Most of the supporting characters are thinly developed, so there's few oppotunities for much empathy or lighter moments. While loyalty was a predominant theme in ""The Lord of the Rings"", this story requires a fair degree of squabbling, which doesn't help matters. Allegories aside, it's a poor choice for young moviegoers. For the rest of us, the pleasures are visible, but sporadic."	2.0	The Silly And The Serious	2006-04-13	18	7	11
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2ZWYRK9LRMTBJ	"Jeff S. Martin ""Jeffrey Stuart Martin"""	"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode, is a decent start to the Chronicles of Narnia movie franchise. I was sufficiently entertained that I will watch it again when it comes out on DVD, and I am looking forward to the next Narnia movie!This movie falls short of excellent because it tries too hard, and the strain shows. The film-makers were in the unfortunate position of having to convince the studio execs at Disney and Walden Media that they could do a good job making The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode. The problem is, I am not a studio exec. I want an excellent movie, regardless of how much money it might make.There are only a few changes made from the book. They shortened up the timeframe a little, showed things that are only hinted at in the book, and increased the tension and drama in a few scenes. None of these changes were bad decisions, but many of them weren't integrated into the plot very well. Rather than feeling the added tension and drama, all I was thinking about was that the screenwriters had made these changes purely to try to make the story better. On a micro level, the movie delivered excellent individual scenes and characters, but the elements didn't quite connect together to make a great movie.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode hits one of it's most emotional notes before it even gets to Narnia. The movie opens with warplanes bombing the city of London, England, terrorizing its inhabitants. Fearing for the safety of the children, the citizens of England have implemented a program whereby children are sent out of the city to live where they will be safer. This dramatic scene introduces us to the four Pevensie children, played by four superb young actors.In spite of great source material and a very handsome budget, the quality of the acting is the main strength of this movie. The children's performances are so very sincere and whole-hearted that I didn't even think about what an excellent job they were doing until after the movie was over. Peter is the perfect older brother left in charge: not quite sure of himself as a leader because of his youth and inexperience, but absolutely determined to follow in his father's footsteps and do his best to keep his younger brother and sisters safe. Edmund is the surly younger brother, chafing under Peter's authority and trying desperately to validate his own worth. Susan is the older sister, mothering the two younger ones the best a 15-year-old can, and cute Lucy, so adorable, yet brave and adventurous, is the youngest, for whom any one of her brothers and sisters (except perhaps Edmund) would lay down their life in an instant.Another excellent performance is put on by the actress playing the White Witch/Queen of Narnia. When I saw previews for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode, I wasn't sure if I would like the way the White Witch was played. I thought she looked too much like an actress in glamorous make-up. But the full realization of her character, in the context of the movie, was completely satisfied convincing.The Witch's general, a minotaur, and her captain of police, a wolf, were developed into more complete and satisfying characters than in the book. There is an added scene between Peter and the wolf captain that makes their second, climactic meeting more meaningful because of the relationship the two enemies have developed.There was a lot of talk on internet discussion boards to the effect of ""they'd better do a good job with Aslan's character."" As with the rest of the movie, Aslan is good, but not excellent. He looks like a real lion, he is majestic and interacts with live actors well, but he doesn't feel quite as alive as he should. If he were a human actor, I would say that his make-up and costume are excellent, and his voice is good, but he's just not that great an actor. I applaud the film-maker's efforts though, and with this experience, I am sure they will do a better job with Prince Caspian.Andrew Adamson and his fellow film-makers have showcased an impressive array of talent in making The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode; now if they can learn to work together a little more fluidly, and the studios give them the opportunity, the big screen future is very bright for The Chronicles of Narnia."	3.0	A decent start; I have high hopes	2005-12-16	5	3	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1RSXP7MB772E3	"Jeff W. Shimkus ""Movie Manji"""	Chronicles isn't another word for trilogy, so if you're in fear of waiting years for resolution like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, or the Star Wars pre-trilogy, don't worry. This movie is complete and stands alone. Sort of like the first Star Wars, or I mean the forth(it's confusing trying to figure out where star wars starts) I loved this film for what it wasn't: A tinsley movie geared down from the category of 'family' to 'childrens'. It certainly has the feel and sometimes the look of more mature works. The landscape camera shots felt like some of the shots of New Zealand from Lord of the Rings; hey, it' aint broke so.... No surprise that some of those responsible for that classic trilogy are apart of this one. But this movie is so much more than borrowed materials and used cliches. It's a great family movie and it drives you into an exploring state of mind. I truely shifted through the wardrobe. It was an intimate transition at first. The furs of the coats brushing the camera and the pace was like a peaceful stroll past a pond. I loved a certain feel this movie had. The tip-toeing of the fawn, the evolving luminosity on the childrens faces mirroring the awakening of the fairy tale land. The child in me broke free and ran around in my head until it collapsed like when I use to play with frenzy.	5.0	Touching movie with an ending that will leave you satisfied	2008-01-27	4	1	3

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A37L87BNKJWKEA	Jennifer A	"The Chronicles of Narnia has been my favorite book series for as long as I can remember.  Everytime I read it I see things I previously missed and enjoy it that much more.  Therefore, when I learned they were making a movie of it, I was thrilled - but anxious to see if the story would be modified for hollywood or kept true to the way CS Lewis wrote it.I was pleased with the outcome.  The movie is true to the book, with a few adaptations to help with the movie flow, but the most important parts weren't changed.  I thought the characters were portrayed well and the actors well chosen for each role.  Liam Neeson's voice for Aslan is perfect, as it has a calm gentleness but appropriate firmness which truly brings the character to life as CS Lewis describes him in the book.  The imagery in the movie was spectacular, as were the special effects.  I was impressed with the way they did the scene when Lucy first goes into Narnia, I really felt like I was entering Narnia with her.The Christian influence to the story was evident to me, showing not simply good vs. evil, but true sacrifice for another person's ""treason"".  However, I don't think it is preacy so as to prevent non-Christians from enjoying a good movie.Finally, I agree with the reviewers that say it isn't too violent.  Like other good vs. evil movies by Disney (Sleeping Beauty, the Lion King, Bambie, Snow White, etc), there are characters that are scary, but not overdone.I could go on, but many reviewers have said so much.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and look forward to buying the DVD when it comes out.  I hope Disney does the whole series of the Chronicles of Narnia...if they are all this good, it will be 7 movies I thoroughly enjoy!"	5.0	An excellent movie - well worth seeing	2005-12-12	8	5	3
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AWM9LKSPMI63B	"Jennifer L. Bouse ""Madison E.Bouse"""	I really enjoyed this movie. I have read almost all the books and I went to see this in the theaters. Overall, this is a great movie, and I was SO PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AND AMAZED AT THE INCREDIBLE GRAPHICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Aslan,(the lion) The griffin, and the beavers were so realistic, everything was, actually.and the storyline is great! It is based on the events that take place in the Bible, like, in the 1st book the Magician's nephew(they haven't made a movie about that)The evil Queen, Jadis(Better known as the White Witch in THe Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe)eats of a forbidden apple. Then, ( in this movie) to cover Edmund's sins, Aslan lets the white Witch kill him, but then he rises from the dead, and the stone table, (the place they killed him)cracks in half, just like the curtain ripped.All in all it is a great movie and the acting surprised me. IT is very well done, and NOT AT ALL like the other 2 dollar movies you can rent, where the beavers and all the animals are just people dressed in suits. This was all computer-animated(Except of course the kids and adults and train and most scenery)so it's not like a cartoon. SO REALISTIC!!!!!!!!

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	"I've never read the original artwork by C.S. Lewis, so my review can by no means assess how true the movie actually is to the original. My kids mildly enjoy this movie and I find it quite interesting. `Narnia' is a good film due to the books and not something that can be credited to the movie's producers. The fantasy and the power of magic that pervades the story might make any child's eyes gleam in admiration and amazement. This needs to be appreciated and makes `Narnia' a nice Christmas movie as well.The characters are somewhat indifferent, save for little Lucy played by Georgie Henley. The remaining three siblings -- Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley), and Susan (Anna Popplewell) also done a good job as well but their characters wasn't as convincing as Lucy's. The two male actors in particular seem a bit overcharged with the movie's scope. They act decently in a way that would definitely suffice for a movie of lesser dimension. This is probably due to a lack of sophistication in terms of the kids' acting skills. Maybe the casting department should have chosen more experienced actors instead of utter newcomers but they had to start somewhere. I can imagine what a challenge it was to process something as huge as Lewis' `Narnia.' It seems to me that the producers wanted to jam as much input into the story as possible, which hampered the natural development of the plot. How can you expect the two boys being good at fighting with their swords in a huge battle? Why are the main characters rejuvenated when they re-enter the wardrobe? In addition some scenes were indeed very corny and too stereotypical for me - even young kids can expect a bit more. The deep emotions were not really influential, which brings me back to the inexperienced actors. What save `Narnia' was the magic of it all. Talking animals, beautiful landscapes, funny dialogs, themes of redemption and courage - this is something to be appreciated, as it might inspire children and adults alike. The movie is an eye-catcher in terms of wonderful visualizations that does justice to Lewis' perception of `Narnia.'""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is a unique story that had room for improvement, but hopefully they can work at it the second time around. Still, with intense battle scenes, menacing encounters with the witch and her minions, and the seemingly fatal injuries suffered by major characters, it seems to me that this film pushes its PG rating to the limits but who am I to judge."	4.0	I must admit the talking animal was very intriguing.	2006-07-16	3	2	1

With more special features, and a really nice looking case, it's worth the extra couple of dollars.  As for the film itelf, this was a wonderfully made movie.  It stayed true to C.S. Lewis' books and the animation was state of the art.  I also liked the parallel between Aslan and Jesus, and it was as emotionally stirring as the Passion of the Christ.  A great way to show the Christian story to an audience of children.	5.0	A wonderful family film	2007-11-28	3	1	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A10T0OW97SFBB	Jesse Rouse	"I was really looking forward to this movie.  Multiple people saw it and told me it was amazing, so I was hyped up when I went to see it.  I was terribly dissapointed.  Not only did it make a ton of changes (I admit I am a big Lewis fan and noticed a lot), but it changed the whole focus of the story!  In the book, the focus was on Aslan.  Aslan ended the winter, Aslan was behind all of the good.  In the movie, the focus is taken off of Aslan and put onto the children.  At one point Mr. Beaver says that ""the hope that you have brought"" is what is ending the winter.  Also, the directer for some reason felt the need to add some good old postmodernism in by changing Aslan's line when he rises from the dead from saying that the witch did not know the deeper magic from before the dawn of time to saying that she ""misinterpreted"" the magic of the stone table.My gripe with this movie is not simply over plot changes either.  I love the Lord of the Rings movies, even though they change a good deal of Tolkien's plot.  I though the characters in this movie were awful as well.  Peter was really wimpy, and what was with the sword pointing?  It looked like he was trying to shoot the wolves with his sword every time he did it.  Edmund was annoying, but he was supposed to be, so they get an A on that casting job.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because Edmund was horribly annoying, as he was supossed to be.  At least they got one character right. Susan was played well, but her character was different than in the book (the movie turned her into a big doubter and spoil-sport). Lucy was FAR better than the PBS version's Lucy. Mr. Tumnus was very good, probably the best character in the movie. Aslan is horrendous.  Instead of the powerful, terrifying, yet loving character of the book, he is a wimpy guidance-counselor.  The choice of voice for him was awful.  They needed a deep, booming voice.  The voice only added to the guidance-counselor impression.In addition to that, it looked bad.  There were multiple scenes where the background was obviosly fake, and it just looked awful.  Some of the animals looked VERY computer generated as well (esp. the fox). Also, there were stupid errors, like when Peter leaves his sword in the iceberg and magically has it a little later.  Also, Father Christmas (who Lewis specifically says was dressed in red in the book) was dressed in brown, yet Susan later says to Peter ""just because a guy in a red suit gives you a sword.""  Things like that just get on my nerves, and there were a lot of them in this movie.  The bloodless battle scenes were awful as well.  The book was not PG rated (it vividly describes things like Edmund lying in a pool of blood), but I can understand them wanting to make this a PG movie.  However, it is rediculous to try to make a battle scene the climax of the movie when it is rated PG.  If they were going to make it PG, they should have given the battle the same emphasis as it had in the book, which was not a whole lot.  Aslan's death and resurrection was the climax of the book, not the battle scene.In conclusion, this movie was not that great on its own merit, and it is not anywhere near the Narnia of C. S. Lewis.  I am very dissapointed in this movie, since I was expecting so much of it.  It could have been great, but I almost hope that they don't do the rest of the series if they are all going to be as mangled as this one was."	2.0	C. S.

But I'm making this review based on the theatrical version before the DVD is released.  I'll do another one once I get my copy...(If you like the story and you've not seen this ""on the big screen"" go now before it's to late!  You'll kick yourself later if you don't.)** When you watch this movie; listen for the music. The sound track by Harry Gregson Williams is simply stunning!Bold orchestrations, strong choir, some subtle unconventional instrumentation, and careful thematic development define this score as one of the best.A score is like the emotional brain of a movie. It conducts, and cues the audience feelings; Carrying the emotion of the story at each moment. It subconsciously joins with the visuals, going straight to the viewers' heart.A musical score can make or break a movie.  It can rescue a bad movie, or ruin a good movie.But a good movie with a good score is magic.. And that is what we have here.In my opinion Harry Gregson-Williams is one of the great film score composers, with talent that is both broad and deep.Visually, the movie totally works. Overall the cinematography, editing, modeling, animation, and compositing are superb..Flawless?  Never. All movies have flaws.  Watch this for the classic story first. And then watch it again if you want to break from the story a bit, and you may see a few minor compositing mistakes, and a couple of animation goofs.  All easily forgivable, in my opinion.We all loved this movie, especially the kids.  Most of us cried when the witch killed Aslan, and let out some boo-yah's and yes's, when we saw that Aslan knew more than the witch, and was resurrected through ""a deeper magic"".There are some bloodless battle scenes (check out the griffins!). And some scariness with the White Witch.  It is rated PG; So some of the younger or more sensitive kids may need help through the scarier parts.After you've seen this movie, you won't need to watch the rising $281,934,379 box office take (second only to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) to know; This one's a winner!On a different note; It seems a crime, but somehow they think it's a good idea to sell these ""Full Screen"" versions where the image is truncated...  If you buy the ""Full Screen"" version you will loose half the effect; Get the wide screen version and you'll see it all!"	5.0	The sound track knocks this one out of the ball park.	2006-02-07	2	1	1

There have been two sets already. I realize double-dipping is a way to get fans to fork out more money (like the myriad Lord of the Rings sets have been doing), but is it good?

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	"Jim ""Pimmy"""	"I have the whole Chronicles of Narnia series in one book and read The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The Magician's Nephew probably should've been made a movie. Since it comes first and shows the creation of Narnia, how the animals talk and how the witch got there and how the lamp post even got there. Starting off with everything already there might confuse people who never read the books.I think since I read the book, it's why I enjoyed the movie so much. But if you haven't you'll be entertained but think the movie is uneven and should explain stuff like how the witch got there and how she got in power. Anyway although those things should've probably been included, this is a very very faithful adaption of the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It's what it should be like and is pretty much everything I read from the story. I mean the things that are missing aren't from this story, are from the story before it. So this can't be called a bad adaption at all. I guess those critics who gave it ** or ** 1/2 didn't read the books because this is the book about 95%.Even the casting of Tilda Swinton as the Witch, is just brilliant. She is the part and just the way you'd picture her while reading. The special effects are perfect and should be nominated. The Lion looks great and is sometimes hard to believe he is computer animated. Liam Neeson is well fit to talk for him as well. Like I said Magician'ss Nephew should've been made so people who never read the books know what's going on. Still though the movie is enjoyable either way.A lot of reviews are even calling the film a yawn. Even Ebert who gave it *** used the word ""yawn"" in his review header. I don't see how the movie is a yawn at all. Even when you think it will drag on, it doesn't. The movie goes pretty smoothly and isn't boring at all. There's enough wonder and entertainment to keep your attention through-out. Critics are the boring ones. They can sit through a boring 2 hour and 20 minute drama with no complaints. But when a fantasy is 2 hours and 20 minutes with action, adventure and wonder, they call it a yawn ? I doubt all the people clapping afterwards thought it was a yawn. The movie had so many loud and thrilling moments that it should've probably have been PG-13. So no way should the word ""yawn"" be used to explain this movie. I only think it was probably a little too violent to be PG and the kids voices can be annoying from time to time lol. Those are about my only complaints though."	4.0	Wow, critics are stupid!	2005-12-09	9	7	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3M6B1VZZXGKSL	"J. Johnson ""zerothis"""	I just spent the day going back and forth to the video store because Narnia has some sort of copy protection that prevents it from playing for legitimate users. I say 'often' because I tried playing it on my set top player, two different computers two different operating systems and 5 different software players. Granted, I probably have worse luck than average, but this is still unacceptable; None of them worked. The video store said the disk might be scratched and replaced it with another Narnia DVD. This DVD had the same issues. One my third trip to the store I brought my laptop to test whatever DVD I decided to buy. This is what it has come to, bringing my own player to the store to shop for movies. While trying to work this out at the store, an employee admitted that they had not been able to view Narnia at the store because none of their demo players were compatible with it. Again, a reason I use the word 'often'. I did a quick search on the internet as to what the problem was and how to fix it. Turns out Narnia has some sort of new copy protection scheme that is no problem at all, for people illegally copying it!  Those of us that follow the rules are just out of luck. I would like to suggest to Amazon that they list the copy protection schemes in the Product Details section. That way people will be better equipped to decide if a movie is likely to be useless to them. I personally am not going to buy any more movies unless I know before hand if they will work or not. And as I read back that last sentence, it seems insane that I would actually have to.

Lyon Layden ""Author: The Other Side of Yore"""	"The Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeI read this book as a teenager, learning of Lewis from my passion for Tolkien. The book totally fascinated me then, and made me hungry for more. I remember reading a few more of the books in the series, and though I enjoyed them, I never did find the original magic in them that this one inspired. I lost one of the books or two and never completed the series, but years later I returned to it in order to read them to my step-son, and now I'm very glad to have read the whole series in it's entirity.First off, this and the first book are absolutely the best ones. This time we started with the first book, which I think is named ""The Magician's Nephew,"" and I daresay that as an adult I enjoyed it even MORE than ""Wardrobe."" The origins of the breach into Narnia and the original sin that freed the witch were fascinating to me.But returning to ""Wardrobe"" was a true delight. Now that I can better digest the symbolism and glean more from the story with the added info learned from ""Nephew,"" the book claimed a new tantalizing power over me. My step-son enjoyed it immensely, and couldn't wait to have another chapter read to him each night for bedtime.As an adult I am now able to better appreciate Lewis's incredible talent for character developement and symbolism, as well as his strong imagination and elegant writing style. The rest of the books were also great, and I'm happy to have finally gotten around to reading them all. Certainly the least in the ""Narnia"" series is far and above the vast majority of children's chapter books. But for me, the first two are by far the best, approaching the status of even 'The Hobbit,"" and from me that is saying worlds.I was delighted to find that just as I was reading the series again, the movie was in production. I think the movie was a great rendition of the book, well directed with excellent actors and excellent special effects. Of course it didn't include or capture everything in the book, but hey, it's a movie. They did alot better job of it than most movie renditions of popular books or stories. I really hope they continue the series through the entire span of the books.J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"	5.0	Great Movie!	2007-04-15	3	2	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	Making a live action film adaptation of The Lion, the Witch, the Wardrobe is a risky venture.  Sure, there are legions of fans of the Narnia series but there are mythical creatures and talking animals and children who are heroes.  This is such an easy novel to mess up and make a really cheesy movie with bad special effects.  Like Gollum in Lord of the Rings, if Aslan did not succeed the film itself would have failed utterly.Fortunately, Aslan does work on screen and the cheese factor is quite low.  The children do a fine job and the CG effects are excellent.  The world is brighter than Middle Earth, but Narnia looks fully realized on screen.The story is a fairly simple one, four children in war torn England are sent to a relative's home to stay so they are not at risk from bombings.  While playing in the house they discover a wardrobe which harbors a secret: out of the back of the wardrobe is some sort of a portal to a different wintery world: Narnia.  Narnia is ruled by the White Witch and is permanent winter until the return of Aslan.  These children are foretold in prophecy and will have a major role to play in the future of Narnia.The story is simple.  It could be viewed as a typical fantasy stet up.  But because C.S. Lewis was also a Christian writer there is a very strong Christian overtone (or underpinning) if you know what you are looking for.  It is there, but it is not overwhelming.Rated PG, this film is toned down for children.  The battles are nothing like that of Braveheart or Lord of the Rings, and yet this does not feel as if it were a children's movie.  Well made.  Well acted, even by the children.  Well done.There are a slew of bonus features on the two disc DVD: Bloopers, multiple commentary tracks, documentaries and features on the making of Narnia (including a focus on Lewis himself), and the creatures and legends of Narnia.  This is a very complete DVD for the fan of the film and the novels.-Joe Sherry	4.0	the live action adaptation that really works	2006-04-06	3	2	1

The only regret I had was the trimming down of the resurrection of Aslan.  Its overall impact compared to earlier filmed versions does not rest solely with modern CGI.  Rather, it was the involvement of C.S. Lewis' own stepson Douglas Gresham.  Gresham has been a faithful guardian of not just the content of Lewis' work but also their spirit.  His participation benefitted the production enormously.  With that said, let me encourage those who have the theatrical release that the extended footage is certainly worth the asking price.  Even without the featurette on Lewis' life and other goodies, the battle scenes were paced better and more compelling.  Other additions will mainly interest those who have watched the theatrical release on DVD many times over as they point and say ""Aha!  There it is!"".  Still, nothing was disruptive or irritating.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2TUA4VWCMNXI	John D. Cofield	I came late to the Chronicles of Narnia, not having read them until adulthood, and they have always lacked the sparkle that J.R.R. Tolkien's works have for me. Nevertheless they are enchanting stories in their own right, and I have read them several times and enjoyed them for themselves and for their symbolism as well.  When the movie of The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe opened I saw it with some reluctance, fearing that once again any magic might be diluted by my age.I was absolutely wrong.  The Lion, The Witch,and The Wardrobe is an enchanting, incredibly appealing movie which demonstrates the full beauty and grandeur of Narnia, undiluted by my adult eyes and enriched by the symbolism.  There's an innocence and beauty to Narnia which the movie well captures through its lovely scenery and fine actors.  That same innocent beauty is what appeals to me about Tolkien's Shire, which I felt Peter Jackson, magnificent though his Lord of the Rings films are, never really completely caught on screen.There are critics of this movie and of Lewis who attack the Christian symbolism, and there are people who call themselves Christian who misinterpret this movie (and Lewis himself) in order to advance their own social/political agendas.  What I love about Lewis and this movie is that they portray the story behind Christianity so that we see it in its ideal form and not as some prefer to twist it.	5.0	Narnia At Its Most Glorious	2009-01-17	0	0	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A9TG2NFA614S9	John F. Rooney	"C.S. Lewis's ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" with its seven allegorical books is becoming the latest film franchise. This first movie based upon the second book in the series is filled with talking animals and mythical creatures like centaurs, satyrs, fauns, gryphons, dwarfs, a wicked albino witch, and four charming and innocent British school kids. The movie is entertaining, but it does not seem to resonate with any great significance or meaning despite Lewis's reputation as a Christian polemicist.The four siblings who have been evacuated from the London blitz during War II are staying with a rich man in his country mansion. The youngest, a girl, travels to the snowy land of Narnia by entering a magic wardrobe. She meets a faun and the wicked witch. The most important creature in Narnia is Aslan, the lion.The film is entertaining, well-cast and well-acted, has some great special effects as well as a few hokey ones, the voices of some famous stars, but there's no there there; it lacks the underpinning of a substantive reason for being.William Mosely who plays the older brother is every teenage girl's heartthrob.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	"""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is one of the best fantasy films I have seen in recent years, eclipsed in its grandeur and cinematic scope only by Peter Jackson's acclaimed ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (I might also add too that I've enjoyed ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" much more than any of the ""Harry Potter"" films.). Like Jackson, director Adam Adamson also draws upon the New Zealand landscape in his cinematic depiction of Narnia, and the film's cinematography is close to the high standards established in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Much to my pleasant surprise, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a very faithful adaptation of the C. S. Lewis literary classic; Adamson's slight improvements - most notably the opening sequence of London under attack by Nazi Germany Luftwaffe bombers at night - merely fleshes out some of the intriguing backstory which Lewis himself had omitted.The cast is truly spectacular, with excellent performances from the four children who will lead Narnia to spring and freedom from the century-old oppressive rule of Jadis, the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton): Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley), Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes), Peter Pevensie (William Moseley), and Susan Pevensie (Anna Popplewell). Indeed, Georgie Henley's Lucie is so fascinating a character that she nearly steals every scene she is in, along with Anna Popplewell's Susan. But I found most beguiling, Tilda Swinton's icy portrayal of Jadis, the wicked White Witch and self-styled Queen of Narnia. Other notable performances include James McAvoy's Mr. Tumnus, the faun, Jim Broadbent's Professor Kirke, and especially, Liam Neeson's Aslan. The CGI is surprisingly not up to ""The Lord of the Rings"" standards, but is still quite good, with some of the best work set aside for Aslan, Narnia's regal lion and leader of the forces of good. ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is one of the most impressive films I have seen this year, worthy of interest for children of all ages, regardless of whether they have or have not read C. S. Lewis's literary classic series ""The Chronices of Narnia""."	5.0	"Splendid Adaptation of C. S. Lewis's ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"""	2005-12-24	7	5	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A307YA9UCASNVQ	Johnny Deep	"I totally agree with the ""Tolkien Lite"" review below.  The movie was definitely a let down.  I have fond memories of the Narnia books from childhood, and I think the movie could have been much better had they used better actors.  The children were mostly awful, especially the one who played Lucy (and her spoiled brat outbursts in the commentary track didn't help any).  Some of the CG was good, but most was not.  I was surprised to see that WETA and Richard Taylor (of the LOTR movies fame) were involved: they were either rushed or poor decisions were made for them by the director.All in all, the entire movie seemed much less lovingly crafted than Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy.  Which is a shame, since it was actually quite promising up until they got to Narnia, but then went down hill fast as it seemed to make a mad dash for the big battle finish line.  Liam Neeson - whom I usually like - also seemed mis-cast as Aslan, or at least his heavy Irish accent sounded quite out of place coming from a lion.I really wanted to like this movie, but it just didn't measure up.On the positive side: the DVD packaging was nicely done, mimicking the look of the LOTR sets, but there was no 10 page booklet in mine as advertised by Amazon.  And the three songs played over the ending credits were intriguing, one by Alanis Morisette."	2.0	A let down	2007-01-04	14	6	8

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A33CLVW2K7SL1P	Jonathan Appleseed	"I am an enormous fan of C.S. Lewis's (Jack) work regarding Narnia. Reading them as a child lifted me to heights that I will never forget.Now - don't get down on me and trash my review. I loved the film; hence the four star rating. Anyone that has seen the BBC movie released in 1988 or so, understands that there is an enormous difference between the two films. The BBC film was, almost, line-by-line faithful to Lewis' work. Sadly, it wasn't very good. It was excruciatingly slow when it didn't need to be slow. Imagine two minutes of watching fawns and what not simply walk. Ugh. Horrific.This was not a line-by-line rendition of the book. Critics who say it was were on drugs. Today we live in an age where action is more preferable than faithfulness (as seen in the Lord of the Rings), but if the faithfulness is close enough, then we must accept it. I struggled with this viewing, but in the end, I decided that I liked it, that it was close enough in form to Lewis' writing. Sadly, as was Tolkien, Lewis wasn't around to tell us what he thought of it. Many critics have applauded the film for being true to Lewis' work. I can't imagine what they were thinking. Yes, there were the four Pevensies crowned at Cair Paravel. Yes, there was a White Witch (played brilliantly), and yes there was a magnificent lion and very well performed Sons of Adams and Daughters of Eve. Peter, in particular, was marvelous. Edmund, who played both a traitor and a ""good guy"", was intensely believable. He cast well.But there were serious derivations from the book. HOWEVER, this is not a bad thing. Lewis' book was not an action packed book. To turn it into a film, action need to be inserted, and the directors did just that. I'm not speaking only of the battle scene (which did not occur in the book), but rather a number of other events. However, they were all used to add tension to the story, and they didn't take anything away from the story. To speak freely - the action added events did nothing to harm Lewis' story.Initially I was upset at the changes that were made. Now, however, as I've had time to think about it, I can understand why *most* of the changes were made. Personally, I wouldn't have made certain changes - specifically, how Lucy and Edmund ended up in Narnia together. The change from the book to the screen didn't make much sense to me.All that aside, being a Narnia purist, I would love to see more movies, even if the derive a bit from Lewis' telling. This was terrific and magnificent.And Aslan - well, he needed to be perfect, and he was. Kudos to those who drew him.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AUS2EQT4NU3BF	"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner"""	"The genre of fantasy has long been ignored for quite a long time in cinema (especially after a period of hit-and-miss entries in the 1980's), but now it has been heavily revitalized, thanks to the runaway success of both Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and the HARRY POTTER movies. Based on this, it is probably no surprise that another beloved fantasy literature series would get the big screen treatment. And what better choice than C.S. Lewis' enchanting CHRONICLES OF NARNIA? In a surprising collaboration between Disney and Walden Media, the first book in the series, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, hit the theaters in 2005, and went onto become both a critical and popular success. The film may not be a replica of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but that is hardly its purpose. All it has to do is bring this beloved tale to the screen with a touch of magic and heart, and thanks to the craft of highly advanced special effects and fine performances, it manages to do just that.The story begins in World War II London, where four Pevensie children--Lucy (Georgie Henley), Susan (Anne Popplewell), Peter (William Moseley), and Edmond (Skandar Keynes)--are forced to live in the mansion of an enigmatic professor. During a hide-and-seek game, the children discover a wardrobe which turns out to be a portal to a mysterious magical world called Narnia, a land inhabited by talking beasts and mythical creatures. Unfortunately, this kingdom is under the rule of the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who has cursed the entire land to an eternal winter. Only the great lion king, Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), and the children can put an end to her evil reign.The story has been told several times before Disney's rendition. There was an animated feature produced by Bill Melendrez which aired back in the 1970s, and a three-hour long television adaptation courtesy of BBC. Both of these adaptations showed their age in production values, yet remained fairly faithful to the source material. For those of you who fear that Disney's acquisition of NARNIA means a ""Disneyfication"" of a classic story, DON'T. As with Jackson in LORD OF THE RINGS, director Andrew Adamsom shows tremendous respect for the source material, and does a first class job of transitioning it to the big screen without sacrificing its magic or substance. If you're expecting a totally literal adaptation, though, chances are you might be disappointed, because there are a few scenes from the book which are obviously shortened and/or altered, as well as some which were added in. However, none of these ""changes"" compromise the story in any way; the magic of Lewis' world is imperishable, and overall this adaptation is commendably faithful while adding to it in the same way that Jackson's LOTR did.There are a few places where the visual effects, as produced by LOTR's Weta Digital in New Zealand, lack polish, but are otherwise breathtaking, particularly the talking animals (including a pair of gently funny beavers) and especially the climactic showdown. What ultimately makes this NARNIA are the sincere, believable performances courtesy of the excellent cast. Young Georgie Henley as Lucy, in particular, sparkles the screen with a radiant innocence and cuteness without being saccharine. Her siblings acquit themselves fairly well, too, although William Moseley's Peter is a bit on the wooden side. Liam Neeson has the perfect voice for Aslan, while Tilda Swinton oozes both evil and charisma as the White Witch.I'm sure that the ages-old book vs. movie debate will last for eternity (in addition to comparisons to previous filmed versions), but this brand-new NARNIA is still most welcome. It doesn't have the depth or complexity of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but it does have a special charm and childlike wonder which makes it a treat in its own right. It will be interesting to see how subsequent adaptations of the remaining books in the series will turn out."	5.0	Disney and Walden Media do C.S. Lewis right.	2008-04-27	3	2	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A25CQTB313XDWO	"JON STRICKLAND ""Jon Strickland"""	The Chronicles of Narnia-The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an excellent movie. Great acting, wonderful production, outstanding special effects, and Andrew Adamson's vision all create a winning formula for Buena Vista Home Entertainment.Though there are violent moments and scenes that are outside the boundaries of a typical children's story, they are nonetheless used to provide a range of both intensity and depth that would appeal to a more adult audience that had just enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which the Chronicles has often been compared and contrasted with. Tilda Swinton highlights the suspense as the wicked White Queen in a way that would have many a moviegoer to put her on par with Alice Krige as The Borg Queen from the Star Trek Universe.The movie score accompanies the motion picture quite well. Also noteworthy are Liam Neeson's vocal contributions depicting the brave, kind, war-weary protagonist, the lion known as Aslan.All in all, I am pleased that strong markets exist for good story movies such as this, and I look forward to the The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, which is scheduled for release on May 16, 2008.	5.0	EXCELLENT C.S.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A311626XD2C4T2	JordanJasper	"I wanted very much to like this film, but it was indeed one of the few I have ever ""walked-out on"" in an actual theater. I knew after 40 minutes that it was lame, and that the story was not being well-served by this particular production-team and its adaptation. There was no sense of wonder or palpable enchantment, despite the lavish sets and other cinematic bells & whistles. The ""telling"" of this tale seemed stilted and rote on-screen, as if crafted entirely by mechanism, rather than any winsome adherence to (or attempt to capture) the spirit of C.S. Lewis' allegorical classic. The characters (particularly the Pevensie children) seemed all stock and stone, save for the youngest, who was quite sparkling...though hardly able to carry a film of this magnitude on her dimples and adorable picket-fence grins.To be fair, the film is more convincing the second time around, on a smaller screen at home. This widescreen DVD Edition reminds us that this installment of the series may have been much more well-conceived as a TV-miniseries. One's home-entertainment center seems able to do better justice to the paint-by-numbers ""small-mindedness"" of this version than the local cinema-screen. The extras are typical, and nothing to get overly excited about. The film is a relatively unimaginative rendition of the original story, poorly paced, competently shot, and decently acted. Tilda Swinton breathes the only hint of transcendent possibility into the movie. Her portrayal of Jadis, the White Witch, was truly compelling and free of the overwrought scenery-chewing that a lesser actress might've brought to the character. She's excellent. Alas, Swinton's essentially ""supporting"" role cannot carry a film of this scope, either. Kids, young adults, and fans of the Lewis Narnia tales should have this in their collection, to be certain. It's on a par with most of the Harry Potter adaptations (which are largely mediocre-to-pleasantly ""watchable"" for adults). For what it could have been, however--given the overall talent and big budget--this journey to Narnia is nevertheless a disappointment."	2.0	Weak-Yet-Overblown Treatment of a Classic Tale	2008-12-02	3	0	3

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2DSXA1E02C86D	Joseph Haschka	"Well, it wasn't actually a rabbit hole, but a mysterious wardrobe in the upper reaches of an English country house owned by Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent), to which the Pevensie children - Peter, Edmund, Lucy, and Susan (William Moseley, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley, and Anna Popplewell) - are evacuated during the London Blitz.Out the back end of the wardrobe, the Pevensies find the land of Narnia, currently in the throes of a civil war between the forces of Evil, led by the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), and those for Good, led by Aslan, a regal lion, who sounds suspiciously like Liam Neeson. The inhabitants of Narnia aren't normal humans, but talking animals - including wolves, beavers, horses, foxes - plus centaurs, gryphons, satyrs, fauns, dwarves, and malformed monsters too numerous to enumerate. In any case, local legend has it that the power of the White Witch will be broken with the arrival of two human boys and two human girls, so you know that our young adventurers are much in demand by both sides.Cinematically, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA seemed to me like an amalgam of THE LORD OF THE RING series and the HARRY POTTER series, with a bit of King Arthur, Alice in Wonderland, and the Waltons thrown in for good measure. (William Moseley reminded me of a younger John-Boy.) Unfortunately, none of the Good Guys - the Pevensies and Aslan - have as nearly an interesting or meaty a character as the White Witch, and Swinton's performance was, for me, the best and only reason to see the film at all. True, the cinematography and fantastic scenery, both real and computer-generated, are almost as good as those in the RINGS series, but, after sitting through those interminable productions, who needs more?THE CHRONICLES is a pre-adolescent fantasy that I wouldn't necessarily recommend to anyone unless he/she could answer ""yes"" to the question, ""So, what, are you 12?"" There's also a blatant parallel between Aslan's role and the death and resurrection of Jesus which is entirely unnecessary though, because I've never read the original stories by C.S. Lewis, perhaps I'm just flaunting my ignorance. Since there are seven titles in the Narnia collection, I assume there are more films to come. Oh, please not. The LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy was enough.One particularly enchanting special effect was the manifestation of tree spirits in the mid-air aggregation of wind-blown leaves. And I have to admit that I especially liked the ending, not because it was the conclusion to a film which was causing me to fidget, but because it neatly tied up the Pevensies' years-long experience in Narnia to but a brief second of real-world time. That's the magic of childhood fantasies."	3.0	John-Boy Walton and sibs fall down rabbit hole into Wonderland	2005-12-24	9	3	6

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A25Z3NHE7WT1SI	"Jovialities ""jovialities"""	"I'll bet you didn't know this: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is a Christian allegory. All right, you did know because every Christian congregation, radio station and bookstore in the nation has been hyping this big screen adaptation of the C. S. Lewis classic as if seeing the movie will lead to everyone's conversion and salvation. Hey, I was intimate with Wardrobe for 9 weeks about 15 years ago. So I knew this going in to see the movie, but I didn't know it back then. As a young director, just out of college, I directed a high school production of one of the many stage adaptations of the novel. I read the novel several times, but being a new director I didn't do any further research. It didn't strike me until the final dress rehearsal of that production that it was a Christian allegory when I had the epiphany that it was after one rehearsal when Aslan said, while being taken captive by the White Witch's army, ""Peter, put away your sword."" So, I wouldn't feel too clueless, if I were you, if you missed the Christian aspects of the latest screen adaptation yourself.I was able to take advantage of a rare day off this Christmas weekend and see the film with my family. I love the story and wanted to share it with my children. Afterward, my son asked a lot of questions about why Aslan did what he did and I was able, like a good Christian father should be, to explain to him that Aslan is supposed to represent Jesus. When I said that, my wife's face lit up with recognition. I said, ""You didn't know that?"" She replied, ""No.""So how is it possible that this blatant representation of the Passion of Christ has left two reasonably educated adults clueless about it's Christian nature until it has been pointed out to us? Is it because the current movie lacks the novel's ""Last Supper"" scene? Is it because after Aslan walks through the forest, representing the Garden of Gethsemane, with Lucy and Susan he willingly gives himself over to the queen with no opposition from his own followers? Is it because the movie lacks the novel's scene where the White Witch forcibly takes Aslan into custody over Peter's protestations and Aslan says, ""Peter, put away your sword?"" Or is it simply because the movie, like it's source novel, is so overloaded with pagan imagery that it is nearly impossible to see the Christian forest for the pagan trees? This could be the topic of a very interesting academic paper. But I digress.I would answer, ""E, all of the above"" to all these questions. Because Lewis was an unabashed Christian apologist and because Lewis wrote The Chronicles of Narnia as allegories to illustrate certain Christian principles, the conservative Christian movement in vogue today has taken this up as their banner to promulgate their agenda. We must remember, however, that Lewis was a scholar and a writer of fiction in addition to being a Christian. Without elements of the fantastic, Lewis' thesis on the true nature of sacrifice might never have gained an audience. While Lewis included a great number of pagan images to captivate his audience, he left enough of the Christian narrative intact to make his point. Unfortunately, despite marketing through Christian outlets, the producers have left too much of the Christian narrative out of this adaptation.Does that make this a bad movie? Not at all. For the viewer who already knows the Passion narrative, this movie is a great way to start a conversation about concepts of sacrifice, forgiveness, salvation and redemption. For the viewer who knows nothing of the Passion narrative, it is a great starting point to talk about the Passion and the Resurrection. For everyone, it is a visual feast.From the opening scene of the bombing of London, through the children's arrival at the Professor's manor, to Narnia in winter and the final White Stag hunt, this movie is visually stunning. With a few exceptions, the graphics are very realistic. I'm surprised, however, that the worst graphics are not the movie's creatures, but several shots showing the children walking in front of obviously projected landscape backgrounds. Come on, this is the oldest form of visual effects known to the movie industry. How is it possible the producers allowed these shots to be the worst effects shots of the whole film? Were they shot late and tacked in during post-production? Minor visual effects sloppiness aside, the visual aspects are amazing.As a director of children's theatre, I am continually amazed at the ability of filmmakers to find children capable of realistic portrayals of children. All four child actors are very consistent in their performances and incredibly good at working in front of the green screen with nonexistent acting partners as they converse with the Beavers and Aslan. Tilda Swinton is amazing as Jadis, the White Witch. Her controlled calculating portrayal of pure evil is - icy, for lack of a better word. Not one character has been miscast here.If I have to find fault with the filmmaking itself, it is in two critical areas: pacing and sound mixing. This is a slow-moving film. This is a novel that can be read in the time that it takes to watch the movie. However, this movie that runs just under two-and-a-half hours felt a lot longer. In addition to the final battle for Narnia, there is a much longer battle between Peter and the Wolf (no pun intended) in the novel before Peter defeats him. In fact, the Wolf has a much greater presence in the novel than the movie. I was disappointed that Peter defeated the Wolf so easily, by accident of a poorly executed move by the Wolf, no less. This was a missed opportunity for a great action sequence. And as far as final battles go, Narnia's was one of the most anticlimactic I've seen lately, sorry to say.As for the sound mixing, I was very disappointed. I lost many of the best lines due to poor volume in a theatre outfitted with incredible Dolby Surround Sound. It is possible to record a whisper and make it sound full and clear. How could the sound people miss this?For me, though, the best thing was watching all the pagan imagery dancing around on the screen in this movie trumpeted by the Christian right as the next Passion of the Christ and the antidote to Harry Potter. What a wonderful joke the producers pulled over the NeoCons. I haven't the space to list every image, but I'll get you started with a few of them. There is the Wardrobe itself. It is a huge oak chest with raised carvings of oak trees all over it. The oak tree is one of the oldest pagan symbols and one of the symbols of the Greek god, Zeus. While the lamppost is an unapologetically Christian symbol, the presence of a faun is very disturbing. The last creature I would ever want an 8-year-old girl to go off into the woods with is a faun. That usually ends up in a drunken orgy somewhere in the woods. If you consider that another meaning of rape is abduction and abduction is kidnapping, then Tumnus has been a very bad Faun indeed! I won't even mention the juvenile giggles I enjoyed every time the Beavers were onscreen, talked or simply mentioned. While magic is only used by the evil character representing Satan, Santa does bring Lucy a healing potion and both armies are heavily populated with mythical creatures: centaurs, minotaurs, gryphons, chimeras, and fauns. Oh my!Though more than 40 years younger, Lewis was a literary contemporary of Sigmund Freud. There is much in Narnia that is expounded upon by Freud and Jung, neither of whom is much liked by today's Neo-conservative churches. I find the Christian community's embracing of Lewis' work interesting at best and unsettling at worst. However, since religion is politics in a different robe and since politics breeds strange bedfellows, I can't imagine a better pair of strange bedfellows than this.Despite its conflation of myths, The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is a visually stunning and well acted, albeit slow-moving, tribute to a great twentieth century work of great literature.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1LVZOK9F7K4CN	JR Pinto	I LIKED this movie, but I didn't love it.  Perhaps that is because the book upon which it is based is so short.  C. S. Lewis got to the point quickly with his story - there was no time for dilly-dally.  Also, he wrote it with a sense of wit by making wry comments on the action in his authorial voice.  As such, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was definitely a children's book - although it can be read and enjoyed by adults.  However, the movie comes out after The Lord of The Rings, and so tries to invoke that feeling.  The result is sort of a mixed bag - stuff for kids mixed with violent battle scenes.  There is also a lot of traveling time, which slows down the action.However, the special effects are done very well.  The sight of realistic talking animals could have destroyed the film, but it manages to pull it off.  Tilda Swinton is attractively evil as the White Which and Aslan is a wonderful mix of CGI and a performance by Liam Neeson.SPECIAL NOTE:  There has been some harsh criticism of this film as Christian propaganda.  The only way for that argument to be made is to point out that a central character dies, and then is resurrected.  In the first place, that is not enough.  Second, so what?  Just because C. S. Lewis was Catholic, does that make him a bad guy?  Are we not only suppose to suppress religious literature, but EVERYTHING that was ever written by people who believed in God?

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3G513SLWRB1JR	Julie A., Karinshak	I don't fully agree with some of the other reviews.  I have read the entire Chronicles of Narnia book set and the more I get into it, the more I find myself trying to imagine what these things would look like if I were faced with them it real life.  I definately think that the movie does this justice!  C. S. Lewis doesn't fully go into certain things that were expanded in the movie and were very well done.  For instance, that fact that the story takes place during the boombing raids on London of WWII.  Also, what would this mysterious place called Narnia look like.  What would the animals look like?  Would it be like things that we are already familiar with?  What would it be like to leave one world where your scared and afraid and faced with a harsh, cruel reality and enter a new world with another reality that is cruel in almost the same way, but in a completely different context.  I think this movie is wonderful in allowing you to forget the special effects and actually try to enter the childhood fantasy of Narnia.  You can't just kind of watch it, you have to completely watch it, in order to fully appreciate it.  Try it and then you can appreciate things like the Mr. & Mrs. Beaver, the wisdom of Aslan, the terror of the White Witch, and the reality of 4 children.  I would also like to say that I'm glad they picked the 4 children they did.  It's nice to see a big film company use kids who can lose themselves into what there doing to become their characters, instead of big name actors trying to make big bucks and earn their next major award.	5.0	Watch the movie and then decide!!!!!!!!!!!!	2007-01-05	2	1	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"I've never read the literary classics that comprise C.S. Lewis' epic ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series. Growing up, I know that some of the books were required reading in some of my friends' classes, but never in my own, and then once I began to develop my own taste in books, those novels never really seemed to pique my interest all that much. When the trailers began showing up advertising the release of the first film, in what Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media were hoping to be a hit franchise based on the novels, my initial reaction was that it looked interesting and appeared to have great special effects, but I wasn't sure if it was the kind of movie I would enjoy. I know that the novels had previously been adapted, with a very limited budget by the BBC into low-budget movies, so I figured this new film had to at least look better than those did, but aside from Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" novels, I really hadn't enjoyed that many fantasy films. I personally didn't enjoy the `Neverending Story' franchise, or ""Legend"" starring a younger Tom Cruise, and generally speaking most movies with kids as the main characters tend to be a bit on the annoying side, so my expectations were coming in a tad on the low side. As low as my expectations were for this upcoming film, when the numerous positive reviews began pouring in, and more action and intriguing story elements were being shown in the TV spots appearing on almost every station known to man, my interest along with my expectations began increasing significantly until the movie finally arrived in theaters giving me the chance to see if all the hype was true or if I would be bored to tears, as I feared could be the case.""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is the story of four siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, as they accidentally stumble across the wondrous land of Narnia, via a magical wardrobe hidden in their house. As they begin to explore this strange new world, and encounter several of its inhabitants, the children soon realize that this once-peaceful world has been plunged into what appears to be an eternal winter filled with despair courtesy of the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton) who has proclaimed herself Queen of Narnia. The longer the children spend in Narnia the more they begin to understand that their appearance in this world was not some random incident, but in fact had been foretold in a prophecy, and that these four children, along with a powerful lion named Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), would lead the good creatures of Narnia in a revolt against the evil White Witch and her minions to return Narnia to its rightful state of peace and happiness.So, after going from absolutely having no interest in seeing ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" to being pretty much excited to see it, I was very pleased that once I watched the film I could honestly say that I loved every minute of it. The movie avoided the pitfalls that I expected it to fall victim to, for instance; having the children be too cutesy and/or annoying brats or just being unbelievable as actual kids via their moods, actions, or whatever; having an extremely boring story with the occasional action sequence to excite the audience but not much else to fill the time (i.e. ""The Golden Compass""); or knowing that it was a Christian themed story, having the basic story be so cheesy and over-the-top in the delivery of the Christian allegory that it would be laughable and yet another example of a horrible attempt to make a Christian movie. Thankfully `Narnia' maneuvered easily around each of these trouble spots emerging victorious as the first successful entry into what will hopefully become an entertaining franchise for audiences everywhere to enjoy.The story, as adapted by Ann Peacock, Andrew Adamson, Christopher Marks, and Stephen McFeely, and based upon the novel by C.S. Lewis, was incredibly fast-paced and entertaining, even though the beginning had me a little worried that it was going to drag out the pre-Narnia part of the children's lives, but even those scenes were surprisingly well-played and lively. Director Andrew Adamson (who also co-wrote the screenplay) deftly handled all of the fantasy elements and action sequences that the story required, while balancing them out with the much quieter moments as the children begin to understand their place in this new world, and the heavy burdens that accompany such an incredible destiny. I was surprised with how solid Adamson's direction was for this movie, since his previous efforts had been the hit animated films ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"" which he was a co-director on for both, so as his first solo outing `Narnia' is an extremely impressive effort that he absolutely knocks out of the park from beginning to end.The primary cast for `Narnia', namely the four siblings, was comprised of relative newcomers to the world of acting, as this was the first movie for most of the kids. It's surprising that Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media would trust newcomers with the starring roles in a movie that could essentially launch a fantasy series that may rival New Line Cinema's epic `Lord of the Rings' trilogy, but the gamble paid off and I honestly don't think any other actors could have done any better. Academy Award winner Tilda Swinton (""Michael Clayton"") was an ideal choice to play the evil White Witch, and she seemed to enjoy the chance to play such an evil, villainous character and made the most out of every scene she was given. Providing the voice of the majestic lion Aslan, actor Liam Neeson (""Batman Begins""), along with incredibly realistic CGI, gave the character a commanding presence with a calm soothing voice that was firm and authoritative, yet soft and caring.I honestly could continue complimenting the various elements of the movie for several more paragraphs, but you the reader would no doubt grow weary of me and lose interest. So, I only have one more item that I feel must be recognized when reviewing this film, and of course I am referring to the outstanding CGI work produced by the special effects wizards that worked so hard behind the scenes on `Narnia'. Without their expertise and considerable talents, this movie would not have been nearly as impressive, and the various creatures wouldn't have been brought to such vibrant life in a way that you almost believed that lions could speak, centaurs could walk amongst us, and that a magical world of wonder actually could exist on the other side of a wardrobe and all you have to do is be lucky enough to find it.""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is an extremely entertaining thrill ride of a fantasy film comprised of brilliant special effects, excellent storytelling, and a talented cast that when mixed together delivers a movie experience that audiences can enjoy for years to come.""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is rated PG for violence."	5.0	The Epic Adventure Begins...	2008-05-19	6	4	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A30CXBWNJ83TUG	J. Whelan	"Fans of live-action CGI adventure fantasies, may (perhaps) find this film mildly diverting.  As a fan of the book by C.S. Lewis, however, I found it quite painful to watch.  The book's wit, charm, and sense of fun, is largely lost, and replaced with a lot of angst-ridden and whiny melodrama.  Even worse than this leaden charmlessness, however, is the consistency with which the film eviscerates Lewis' moral perspective.The Narnia books are famous for reflecting Lewis' Christian beliefs, but Christians come in all stripes and flavors.  Lewis' Christianity, as propounded in the Narnia Chronicles, has anti-authoritatian, and subversive elements.  A central theme is that there exists a higher Moral Authority, with whom the individual has a direct and personal relationship, and to whom he or she owes a loyalty that exceeds loyalty to religious and political leaders, or family members.  The Narnia books frequently cast the protagonists in the role of rebels against existing religious, political and/or social orders.  Some of this is preserved in the film, only because the basic plot is preserved, but subtle changes push the story in a different direction.In the book, the London blitz was only briefly mentioned, and only as a plot device to get 4 English kids, who seemed quite untraumatized and eager for fun and adventure, into a strange old house and away from parental interference.  But Film, instead, starts with an over-the-top London blitz sequence in which the Pevensie kids get traumatized by German bombers.  This alters the entire mood, and turns the Pevensies into whiners terrified of adventure.  Moreover, every story about Good and Evil need not be an allegory about how we Noble Allies beat Those Wicked Germans.  Drawing parallels to the World War detracts from Lewis' more-intimate moral focus.Lewis despised bullies and bullying.  In the BOOK, Edmund's underlying fault was that he had become a bully -- he liked to pick on those weaker than himself.  In the MOVIE, Edmund's underlying fault is thathe refuses to do what he is told (by older brother Peter, who seems to imagine himself in charge).  To put it another way, his fault (in the movie) is his refusal to succumb to his brother's bullying -- or if you prefer, his authority.  Thus does the ideology of the film move in the direction of authoritarianism and power-worship.In the BOOK, when Peter and Susan ask Professor Kirke what they should DO about their little sister's strange beliefs, Professor Kirke, after some discussion, finally suggests ""we might all try minding our own business.""  In the MOVIE, this scene is preserved, except that the Professor instead  says ""You're a family, try acting like one!""  This replacement line is, at best, a completely meaningless non-sequitur in the context of the question. Peter and Susan are trying only too hard to be responsible older siblings -- which is precisely the problem.  But perhaps it was thought it would sound good for those to whom ""family values"" is a mantra. But the line in the BOOK was meaningful.  If reflected, again, Lewis' aversion to the abuse of power.  Professor Kirke was suggesting to Peter and Susan that perhaps they have no authority to play thought-police to their little sister's strange ideas; that they have no right to impose on her their benevolent paternalism; that they should not (so use a Tolkien metaphor) put on the corrupting Ring of Power.  Moreover, since Kirke seems to feel he lacks authority to boss around Peter and Susan, his advice is phrased as a suggestion, not an order.  But I guess such attitudes make no sense to one with an authoritarian mindset.  Therefore, in the MOVIE, the line had to go, however meaningless the bizarre command that is its replacement.In the Book, there is a scene in which Aslan gently reminds Lucy that she has moral duties to others besides family and friends.  Lucy must leave the side of an injured loved-one, and tend to other wounded.  The film keeps the scene, but emphatically rejects the message.  Only after Lucy's injured loved-one is out of danger, and everyone has had time for a nice long group-hug moment, does anyone, including Aslan, remember that others might be injured.  Then Lucy puts on a silly grin, and scampers off to cure them as though it were a fun game and not a solemn duty.A possibly-related complaint is the trashing of most of the main characters.  As a group, the Pevensies have become a group of angst-ridden, self-pitying, bickering, and cowardly moaners and whiners.Peter, in the book, did not shirk his duties or hesitate to accept the adventure offered him.  But in the MOVIE Peter is constantly boring us with his angst and self-doubt and all-too-clear desire to be anywhere but Narnia.  As a result, his transformation from schoolboy to warrior hero seems far less plausible than it was in the book (a problem further compounded by the movie's far greater emphasis on action sequences).Susan fares even worse.  In the BOOK, Susan hesitated only once, and only at the beginning.  She then dived into the adventure with the others, and never looked back.  The film turns into a screeching harpy, whose job is to yell at Peter in the middle of every crisis, either to tell him to go back, or to blame the current crisis on him because he did not.Even Edmund, who was a rotter even in the book, manages to get trashed.  In the BOOK, Edmund move toward redemption begins at the moment when, for the first time in the story, he begins ""to feel sorry for someone other than himself.""  This occurs during a scene when he sees Jadis murder a dinner party of fauns and talking animals -- most memorably a spunky baby squirrel -- and actually tries to stop her.  In the MOVIE, this scene is absent, but is replaced by a scene where Edmund is forced to observe the fate of Tumnus, whom Edmund betrayed.  The critical difference is that the fate of the baby squirrel & friends was NOT in any way the fault of Edmund; whereas the fate of Tumnus WAS Edmund's fault.  In the BOOK, redemption begins with compassion, with love for others.  The MOVIE merely rubs Edmund's face in his GUILT, which is basically just another form of self-obsession.  These and other subtle changes mean that the film's audience never develops any sympathy for the character whose redemption is a central theme.Only Lucy escapes comparatively unscathed.Supporting characters (the Beavers, Aslan, Tumnus) are mainly charmless bores.  The CGI animals are cute -- because and only because they are CGI animals -- and not because of any skill in endowing them with likeable personalities.  Their dialog hits the floor like lead, especially whenever it diverges from that written by Lewis, which is far too often.As for the villains:  The wolves, who ought to be scary looking, instead look like refugees from a film about CGI huskies (which is probably exactly what they are).  Tilda Swinton, as Queen Jadis, is merely okay (in  large part because she is occasionally permitted to speak lines that Lewis wrote for her).  She captures the witch's coldness, but none of her fierce and ruthless energy.In the end, it is an overlong buildup to an over-the-top CGI enhanced battle, in which you are likely to care little about any of the participants."	2.0	Charmless Adaptation, further Marred by Unsavory Ideological Tweaks	2008-05-18	26	21	5

I am pleased to see the fantasy genre of films being taken more seriously as of late and hope to see this continued. This adaptation of C.S.Lewis' The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe was very well executed. The music was amazing, the acting exceptional, the costumes were beautifully done, and the directing was superb. If you have not yet seen this film, do so immediately and invite a few children in your life to experience it with you and may their excitement and awe inspire you. I only hope that they put as much energy and detail into the continuing Chronicles of Narnia.	5.0	All Films Should Be This Good.	2006-02-04	0	0	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	ALLJT7S5QOFFZ	kaduzy	This movie could teach the Harry Potter people a thing or three about how to do an adaptation correctly: how to keep scenes from the book, add scenes of your own and STILL maintain the book's spirit.The movie opens with an unexpected bang, as we see firsthand the damage caused by the air raids over London and quickly establish the contentious relationship between Peter and Edmund.  We're then taken to the train station where we see the full effect the war is having on families as they're separated in the name of safety.  It's impossible not to have boundless respect and admiration for the British for standing strong in the face of this instead of caving in to Hitler like so many other countries in Europe.But I digress -- and the film does not.  The addition of these scenes allows the film to truly delve into the price of war, and the conflict the idea of war causes for the children.  But the message by the end is clear, and echoes the reality: some things are worth fighting for.The movie has a great pace and some beautiful cinematography.  The WETA workshop people did a magnificent job (Harry Potter people take note!  THIS is what a centaur should look like, dammit!) and the acting is also wonderful -- particularly James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, all the children and Tilda Swinton, who invoked some real fear in me as the dreaded White Witch.  In fact my ONLY complaint about this movie is that sometimes director Andrew Adamson (apparently eager to prove himself as capable of directing something other than Shrek movies) occasionally uses cheap directing tricks that distract from the story.  Examples include abruptly long silences at moments of high tension and one particularly pointless scene where everyone's in fast-motion except Peter, both of which are ultimately distracting.  But we can be forgiving, because he succeeds so grandly in so many other areas.One of the best parts of this movie is the score.  I loved it so much that I raced out to buy it right after seeing the movie on Dec. 10th -- only to find out (after driving the salespeople crazy as they looked for it) that it's not coming out until December 13th!  That's too bad, because it means I'll have to wait three more days to bring this music home.  It includes new songs from Alanis Morissette and Imogen Heap and will be well worth the sale price I get it for on Tuesday.  SEE THIS MOVIE!!  Fans of the book won't be disappointed and people who've never read them will be welcomed into a fabulous new world.And as others have said, don't leave the theater the minute the credits roll!

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AVQSP9T6Y7G16	Kaitlyn	Narnia is a story about Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy that had to leave London where they lived to get away from a military attack. They were sent to live with the Professor Digory Kirke that lives in a house in the country. When they were playing hide and seek Lucy runs inside a closet were she found a door to another world. She met a guy named Mr Tumnus with a head of a human and body of a horse. Her brother Edmund finds his way through the closet and ran into a witch who invited him over to her castle for turkish delights if he brings his siblings. Then when she leaves he finds his sister and they both go back home together. When they get back to the house, Lucy tells her other siblings about what they found. Edmond lies and tells them that Lucy doesn't know what she is talking about and gets her upset. Next day they play baseball and the ball gets hit through the window. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy go inside and saw what room the ball went in. They herd the footsteps of the professor and Edmund convinces them to go in the closet they found to hide in their. But actually wanting them to see the new world. They meet these Beavers who invited them for dinner. Edmund gets mad and runs away to find the witches castle to get his turkish delights he wanted. His sibling go after him to get him back. It is too late and Edmund is long gone. They travel to around to go to the Lion the beavers suggested they go. They fight a battle to get Edmond back with the help of a lion and the lions troops. Edmond brakes the witches stick and they eventually they win the battle. I do not like this story at all. I do not suggest this story to anyone. This story is based on greek mythology, mysticism, and witchcraft. I don't suggest ever letting your kids read Narnia because of the witchcraft, mystisism, greek mythology, and it is against scripture.  The Bible says: 2Corinthians6:17(KJV) Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.	1.0	My review of Narnia	2012-05-30	26	0	26
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2SARNTK8O6PL4	K. Alphs	"This movie is brillant! Our family eagerly has anticipated this movie and we were not one bit disappointed. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the story of the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. The children are evacuated from London during the bombings of World War II into the countryside, where they arrive at the estate of the eccentric Professor Kirke. Upon playing hide and seek on a rainy day Lucy discovers an empty room which contains a wardrobe. Lucy climbs into the wardrobe to hide, however she finds herself in the snowy woods of Narnia. This particular scene is reminiscent of Judy Garland opening her front door and stepping into the land of Oz. Lucy meets Mr. Tumnus, a faun who invites her to tea. During tea Mr. Tumnus tells Lucy that Narnia has been under an evil spell cast by the White Witch for the past 100 years, which makes it always winter but never Christmas. Mr. Tumnums also reveals he is in the pay of the White Witch as a kidnapper, but decides to send Lucy back to the city of Spare Oom in the far land of Wardrobe instead of handing her over to the witch. Lucy arrives back in the empty room only to find that time has stood still with the game of hide and seek going on. Later in the night Lucy decides to sneak back to the room containing the wardrobe, Edmund follows her and finds himself in Narnia. Edmund meets the White Witch and reveals to her there are four Pevensie children after the Witch feeds him enchanted Turkish Delight. The Witch tells Edmund to bring his siblings to her and as a reward he will receive more Turkish Delight as well as sharing the throne of Narina. Lucy is delighted Edmund has discovered Narnia also but is humilated by him later in front of their siblings. The next day the four children find themselves bundling into the wardrobe to hide from Mrs. McCreedy and find their way into Narnia. Lucy takes them to Mr. Tumnus's cave only to find Mr. Tumnus has been arrested by the White Witch and his cave in shambles. A robin leads the children to Mr. and Mrs. Beaver. The Beavers inform the children of the prophecy of Cair Parivel when two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit on the four thrones of Cair Paravel and with Aslans return the White Witch will be defeated. Edmund leaves the Beavers to return to the White Witch, who throws him in prison when he arrives alone. Edmund informs the Witch where his siblings are, that they are to meet Aslan at the stone table, whereupon she instructs Margrim, her chief of police to take his army and destroy them all. There is an intense escape scene from the Beavers dam into the woods. In the woods the children meet Father Christmas who gives them weapons to use in the upcoming battle against the Witch. As the children and the Beavers travel through Narnia, spring has come since Aslan is on the move. The group arrives at Aslans camp where they prepare for battle. The White Witch takes Edmund and her army to arrive at the Stone Table before Aslan. However the Witches camp is discovered after Maurgrim attacks Lucy and Susan in the woods. Aslans army frees Edmund and he is reinstated into the Pevensie family. The White Witch arrives at Aslan's camp to proclaim Edmund a traitor and to claim his blood. Aslan and the White Witch meet and later in the evening Aslan goes to the stone table to offer himself as a sacrifice in Edmunds place. Lucy and Susan who accompained Aslan through the woods follow him to the stone table and watch as the Witch slays him. The girls mourn over their beloved Aslan but as the sunrises the stone table is split in two and Aslan is resurrected. The girls and Aslan fly through the woods to the battle field where Peter and Edmund are in the throws of war with the White Witch and her army. The battle scene is spectacular! It is on the same caliber of the ""Lord of the Rings"", but with less bloodshed/violence. Ultimately the White Witch is defeated by Aslan. Edmund is wounded as others are but Lucy uses the gift Father Christmas gave her the elixir of the fireflowers to revive the wounded. The four children sit in the thrones of Cair Paravel as kings and queens of Narnia. Aslan leaves Cair Paravel to venture to other lands. The children now as adults find themselves chasing the white stag through the woods when they discover the lamppost. Lucy leads them through the woods and back into the wardrobe. As they spill out of the wardrobe they are transformed back into children who are greeted by Professor Kirke. Later in the night Lucy attempts to go back to Narnia via the wardrobe but Professor Kirke tells her she can go back to Narnia but not via the wardrobe again.This movie is a faithful adaptation of the C.S. Lewis classic. There are a few added special effects from Hollywood which were not in the book but they serve as a tie in the story. The directing,casting,screenplay, musical score are brilliant! I am sure C.S. Lewis himself would have been pleased with this movie.Our family is eagerly planning on attending another showing of this movie during the Christmas/New Year season.

This one left them all in the dust.It had a similar effect on me as the first installment of ""Lord of the Rings,"" and the first shot of Lantern Waste has me in tears much as the first shot of Rivendell did.  Both had kind of a ""Yes!  That's it!"" quality, as if everything I'd ever envisioned was being brought to life.  However, where Peter Jackson eventually went completely nuts with the plot, in effect writing his own story and saying Tolkien did it WRONG, this film has interpolations I did not find particularly intrusive.  The basic plot remained intact, and the whole film conveyed a sense of bringing to life what CS Lewis actually wrote.  I was a little worried when I saw that Disney was producing this that they'd dumb it down, but the story remains essentially, beautifully intact.I have to add that CS Lewis is my all-time favorite Christian theologian.  I feel that the reviews that have said this is anti-Bible or pro-witchcraft or whatever really need to be taking issue with CS Lewis' writings rather than the movie because the movie is presenting them very faithfully.  The good lion Aslan, son of the Great Emperor Over the Sea, gives his own innocent life for the life of a traitor and is subsequently reborn.  ""The rules"" for this sort of thing antedate the beginning of recorded history.  If you're a Christian, what is there to take issue with here?  If you're a fantasy enthusiast, could you find a better parable or allegory for sin and redemption?  Despite its few dramatic departures, this was a wonderful realization of CS Lewis' book, and I hope and pray that they continue with the rest of the series!"	5.0	The Narnia of My Dreams	2006-02-15	32	29	3

They arrive on the doorstep of a professor whom the stern housekeeper says they are not to bother.  One day they relieve their boredom by playing a game of Hide and Seek.  The youngest child, Lucy, discovers an old wardrobe in a deserted room and decides to hide there.  As she steps back in the wardrobe, she enters another world, Narnia, where the White Witch has declared that there will be perpetual winter.  So begins the adventure of ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"", written by C.S. Lewis who was during the first part of his life, an avowed atheist but who eventually became a strong believing Christian whose literary works influenced many believers and non-believers alike.  The symbolism of the lion Aslin will be clear to Christians and will hopefully introduce unbelievers to the Christian message.

I finally managed to go out and see this magnificent work of art.I have been a fan of Narnia world since I was a little kid growing up in Poland. I remember reading the books and watching any TV movies made about this magical world.Seeing this on the big screen in the dark theater was so powerful, so loud, alive and colorful that I almost forgot I was watching a movie, I felt like I was there in person.The four kids, Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy Pevensie were totally new faces to me but I trusted them to tell the story well and they sure did. I found little Lucy to be the most adorable little girl ever, she was delightful and heartwarming and a real pleasure to watch.I loved the scenery, from the land to never ending winter to the thawing spring breaking through, to the evil and cold witch, who appeared somewhat nice only to be rigid and heartless, to the animals, the fawns, centaurs, wolves, cheetahs, rhinos, flying gryphon's, beavers, polar bears, buffalos and ghouls and goblins down to the magnificent Aslan.I was a wimp, I shed a few tears along with few other people in the audience at the tender and sad scenes, but overall I felt like I've spent 2 magical hours of land of sorcery and shining armor.This is a wonderful movie, and not to be missed whether you read the books or not, do yourself a favor and enjoy it.	5.0	Rainbow of magic	2006-01-05	10	8	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AVZ8NX1P8QPCG	"Katie Carter ""Kodaprn"""	For all you fantasy fans who thought that the conclusion of The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars was the end of the world, think again.  The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe should satisfy the needs of fantasy fans of all ages.The new movie is based on a series of seven books by author C.S. Lewis.  However, this isn't the first time Narnia has been adapted for the screen.  An animated movie of 'Lion' premiered in 1979, and the BBC series in the late 1980s gave viewers a taste of almost the whole series, in which 'Lion' is the second book chronologically, but the first in the series published.'Lion' focuses on the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy.  The story takes place in the midst of World War II England, and the kids are whisked away from home to get escape the air raids.  They go to stay with a professor who, if you've read The Magician's Nephew, is a very significant character.While the bored children play a game of hide-and-seek in the professor's mansion, the youngest, Lucy, stumbles into an old and beautiful wardrobe, and walks into another world: Narnia.  It is here that her, and her siblings', adventure begins.It has been winter in Narnia for 100 years, and is ruled over by the White Witch.  The Pevensie children turn out to be part of a prophecy saying that four children would save the (talking) animals and mystical creatures of Narnia.  They must find a way to defeat the White Witch and restore power in Narnia.  However, Edmund might not be on his siblings' side, as the White Witch tries to seduce Edmund with thoughts of power and an endless supply of Turkish delight (think: Revenge of the Sith?).This movie stayed very close to the book; barely anything was out of place at all.  The cast was excellent, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy, who did a stunning job.  Liam Neeson was also great as the voice of the lion king, Aslan.  However, I can't keep thinking that maybe James Earl Jones would have been better.And the White Witch couldn't have been more perfect.Several scenes in the movie were perfect as well, such as the meeting between Lucy and the fawn Tumnus.  Another great, though sad scene was Aslan's sacrifice on the Stone Table.  That scene followed close to the book as well, and was so touching I swear I was close to tears, even though I knew what would happen next.  However. for people who haven't read the book, small children in particular, it could be quite distressing to watch.The battle scene at the end of the movie was incredibly fun to watch, though some parts dealing with the special effects and the scene in general were slightly awkward.  Speaking of the special effects, those were very good as well, especially in the form of the talking animals of Narnia.All in all, this was, and is, a great, and certainly unique, fantasy story.  The fact that Disney is only making two sequels is a little disappointing to me, but maybe, just maybe, they'll make all seven.That would be great.	5.0	The Next Great Fantasy Series	2005-12-16	5	3	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	"MOVIE: Like the ""skirts and sandals"" phase of movies that hollywood went throught, we now have the fantasy epic phase. I'm not complaining though, I think fantasy is a great genre, and those kind of films are hard to come by. A great fantasy film I recall seeing as a child was The Neverending Story. With HUGE success for The Lord Of The Rings films and HUGE success for Potter and the gang, we now see another work of great literature finding its way to the silver screen. Narnia tells the tale of four siblings finding a porthole into a new world through the wardrobe in their temporary foster home. We learn that the winter in Narnia has been lasting for 100 years now, and that the evil white witch has ruled over the land with an iron fist. We have to remember that this is a film aimed at the younger crowd, but there is plenty to enjoy for the older audience. The film boasts absolutely amazing special effect, as it should. Special effects were done at the WETA workshop in New Zealand, which is where the magic happened for Lord of The Rings and King Kong.  Disney and Walden Media suppossedly spent a whopping $150 million on this production, and if you look at the adverising push they did then that budget may have risen as far as $200 million. The sets are magnificent, and you actually are thrown into this wintry land of fantasy. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams is also absolutly stunning. He forays into a very beautiful orchestral score with some great vocals. It feels like a lighter toned version of his score to Kingdom Of Heaven. Harry Gregson-Williams is my favorite composer that has left the guidance of Hans Zimmer. He developed his own style, and even though the influence of Zimmer is heard in his music it's not overpowering. Other composers from the Media Ventures camp like Klaus Badelt feel like Hans Zimmer clones when they compose.  Look for the score come Oscar time, it should be nominated. Adrew Adamson takes on his first live action film as a director and does a fantastic job with it. Adamson started his directing with Shrek and followed it with the incredibly successful Shrek 2, so I don't think Disney had a problem giving him the job for this expensive film seeing the profit he turned in for Dreamworks with the Shrek films. Costume design and make-up were more lavish than I expected. I expected the costumes to look as if they were from a play, but they were amazing. During the rare occasion that there is a non CGI creature, the make-up on the actor is amazing. Mr. Tumnus is an excellent example of amazing make-up. His small home in the woods is also a great example of the amazing set design. Narnia truly comes to life in this film, and it should see some nominations in the techinical categories. Now, while the film is pretty to look at, it does have its flaws as some of the dialogue is pretty cheesy and some points in the film are very saccharine. Every now and then you get the lame hand on the shoulder and the intent gaze of approval, and then we have the religous undertone. I am not religious at all, and found that the film focused too much on making Aslan a Jesus figure and paid too much time to the theme of having to sacrifice some things for the benefit of others. Overall, I enjoyed this film more than Harry Potter, and I think that this could be a great franchise.ACTING: Having an all children cast is always risky, mainly because of inexperience with actually portraying emotion through acting. However, the kids do an amazing job. I never really liked the children from Harry Potter. Georgie Henley, who plays the youngest daughter, does a fantastic job. You could call her the British Dakota Fanning. As for the rest of the cast, it's mostly CGI. Tilda Swinton does a great job as the white witch, and she does a great job with being evil. The voice acting for the CGI is fantastic. Liam Neeson is probably the most well known actor doing voice work. He gives Aslan the lion a sense of wisdom. My favorite animals would have to be the two married beavers who just bicker as typical husband and wife. The film has everything from cheetahs to polar bears.BOTTOM LINE: A visual feast for the eyes from director Andrew Adamson, and a strong and emotional score from Harry Gregson-Williams. The CGI is astounding, and the sets are amazing. The film is very entertaining even if it get's saccharine at times, but then you have set youself in a child's mindset. A new fanstasy franchise is born."	4.0	Amazing Special Effects, The Characters All Move & Feel Real. The Acting Is Top Notch For A Relatively Unknown Cast	2005-12-15	0	0	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2OG7XE23X5UM2	"KC ""KC"""	"Along with Walter Farley's Black Stallion series (well most of it anyway...), CS Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia were amongst my favorite books growing up - even today (at age 43), I have the books memorized virtually word-for-word, and my junior-year thesis in high school was about CS Lewis and the Narnia series.(I mention ""The Black Stallion"" because I was (and still am) so utterly disappointed with the 1978 Coppola film due to the major changes made to the classic story.)  However, these days (I believe largely due to the Harry Potter series) filmmakers seem to be making a greater effort to 'stick to' classic books as they were written, and thank GOODNESS that was the case here!The film starts rather differently from the book with the London Blitzkrieg and British children being sent to the country for safekeeping - keep in mind that when the book was first published in 1950, WWII was still very fresh in the minds of everyone and there was no need to explain in detail what the air-raids were about.  I thought the children, particularly Peter and Lucy, were spot on; I didn't care much for Susan, but then again, she wasn't my favorite Pevensie in the books either (knowing what happens to Susan in ""The Last Battle"" is probably coloring my viewpoint a bit, however!).  Since the film was made also to appeal to 2005 audiences (who expect a lot of action and adventure) I wasn't surprised to see that certain bits and details, such as Father Christmas taking a high tea out of his sack for the children and the Beavers, were omitted, and other scenes not in the book (such as the three Pevensies and Beavers following Edmund to Jadis' castle) were included.  (BTW I had to chuckle at the bit where Peter and Edmund are practicing their horsemanship and swordplay prior to the battle and Edmund says ""get up horsie"" and the horse responds with ""My name is Philip"").  Speaking of the rest of the cast...I thought Mr. Tumnus was WONDERFUL, better than I had ever envisioned in my mind, he was PERFECT.  As were the Beavers - Mrs. Beaver chiding Mr. Beaver for spending too much time with Badger, giving them both Cockney accents.  Jadis was incredible - again a perfect rendition.  The battle scene was awesome, as was the pivotal scene at the Stone Table.  And Aslan...it was CLEARLY obvious that the producers and directors made every effort to ensure that Aslan would have the impact and regalness that was DEMANDED.  WONDERFUL.I LOVED this film and look forward to seeing ""Prince Caspian"" (Okay...I'm a traditionalist and believe the books must be read in the order they were released...obviously the filmmakers agreed with me, since they didn't start with ""The Magician's Nephew"" which is actually, IMO, the weakest of the seven books along with ""The Silver Chair"")."	5.0	A wonderful, moving adaptation of the book - this IS Narnia!	2005-12-11	10	7	3

I use like derogetorily.  when I find a movie I love I toot it's horn.  I use explenatives like fantastic, amazing, and superb!

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A27P0MW8TE1JQP	Kevin J. Loria	"The Chronicles of Narnia is an interesting ""animal"" in it's marketability. C.S. Lewis' allegory-laden works are more accessible, on many levels for children and church-folk. So, thus the Narnia audience is broader due to its mix of borrowed mythology and Christian imagery. This release is well timed, following the success of both the Harry Potter franchise and the Lord of the Rings ""trilogy."" Well-timed also because the limits of computer animation has been pushed far enough to reverently envision the world of NARNIA. But you still have to work with those darn child actors, or do you...hmm.Narnia, unlike the Lord of the Rings' Middle-Earth, this fantasy-land never quite comes across as consistently real. The Special Effects are very mixed: the wolves are impressive and Aslan, voiced perfectly by Liam Neilson, seems infinitely more realistic than his BBC counterpart (which, many of the other creatures are rather, soulless. Some landscapes recreated on sound-stages and matte paintings are plainly artificial. While, some meshing of real and digital works. Some of these moments with the actors do not. New Zealand director Andrew Adamson, of Shrek 1 & 2, doesn't have much experience with live action movies, coming from a Special Effects background, and maybe the child actors are out of their depth when it comes to acting in front of a green-screen. A lot of ""The Lord of the Rings"" works because the actors convincingly interact with each other as well as with the real or illusion environment. In this film, that doesn't happen. The children are also awkward and foundering when asked to portray some of the more complicated scenes. But I am profoundly pleased that children were cast who look like real WWII evacs and not Sears models.  As for the adult talent, the Evil White Witch, as played by Tilda Swanson was perfect performance for the genre.The film's opening shares more character insights and background than Lewis himself does, foreshadowing Edmund's selfish nature. With a brief but intense air raid on London, leading to the emotional juxtaposition of the evacuation of children to the country. Both beautiful cinematic moments not in the original text. Other classic moments that were from the text, like Lucy finding the wardrobe, were a pleasure to watch.Then of course some of the problems lie with the original material, Lewis' book. The Narnia series is heavy on allegory and a mix of global myths in the fantasy world without any important dramatic justification unlike Tolkien's work. While such a miscellaneous fairy-world work in print or in children's minds, it certainly is difficult to portray on screen without appearing hackneyed to today's audiences. ""Chronicles"" had been promoted as ""a Lord of the Rings for kids"" this is misleading. It may have been the intention of its makers, but not the end product.But in the end it is a FINE big screen version of a fine book series with many magical moments and I hope it does well enough in theaters and on DVD to warrant more films."	4.0	ROARING GOOD TIME, but not without its lion's share of faults.	2005-12-12	4	2	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A30TK6U7DNS82R	Kevin Killian	"We saw this last night in a crowded theater and I was fairly underwhelmed, but maybe if I hadn't read the book I would like it more?Perhaps an extended version would have played better, because the nagging feeling never left me that something was missing.  I could have used some more establishing scenes that showed the Pevensie children having some camaraderie with the creatures of Aslan's army, in the days before the big battle.  As it is, they just sort of swan in and everyone bows--why?  Just because they're human?  Why would all these beasts and centaurs and fauns etc fight for four little humans to conquer them all?  In the book it was sort of explained, and part of that was a certain amount of interchange among all the species, not just the girls playing and the boys riding talking horses.Compare that to the slow-paced, but ultimately worth it bonding scenes in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and you have an idea of what the emotional payoff might have been for NARNIA.However that said it was a spectacular film with some great action sequences, especially trying to cross the river before it melted, a scene which brought back ancestral memories from the very first days of cinema, when Lillian Gish floated on the ice in D W Griffith's WAY DOWN EAST, which this film seemed to be quoting.I didn't like any of the children very much.  Can't wait till that little girl grows up and the gap shrinks between her three front teeth.  I couldn't bear to look at her except when she was crying and that made me feel like a perv.Tilda Swinton put a lot into the part!  Probably more than was in the script.  When she made her triumphant speech on the stone table about the return of ""deep magic,"" she might have been louder, like take some voice lessons or something, she just didn't have the vocal power to shriek it out at the end; but in every other scene she excelled my highest expectations.  At the end of the movie we voted to award her the Oscar for best actress and to give a special award to the NUT who designed her winter and summer wardrobes.  They were eye popping, Leigh Bowery would have been proud."	4.0	Get Her Some More Teeth	2005-12-14	7	1	6
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2	"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore"""	I recently saw this film again after five years, and I stand amazed: it appears, if anything, even more elegant, well designed, and timely than it did in 2005.  With its gorgeously photographed locations, seamless effects, simple yet ambitious physical design, and engaging performances, this movie has withstood several years much better than most can, or ever will.  And its allegory has the potential to instruct children without lecturing them.Director Andrew Adamson creates both the British Blitz and his beleaguered fantasy world with such unassuming grace that it can take effort to recall that these places don't exist in our modern age.  His young actors inhabit both locales with a simple grace, as though they don't realize they are doing anything exceptional.  I never got the feeling of watching a historical pageant or school play, as with prior productions.Beside Peter Jackson's LOTR movies and the Harry Potter films, Narnia marks a reassuring trend in cinematic fantasy: directors depict wonder without childish naivet&eacute;, and they capture the grim underpinnings of magic without maudlin dystopia.  These changes in how films depict fantasy reflect, I think, a more balanced view of reality.  And since Lewis intended viewers to learn something about real life, I think he would approve of this development.	5.0	Allegorical Fantasy	2011-01-05	0	0	0

Seems on TV there is too much of it, and with the Iraq war, I have had enough.  This had plenty of excitement for kids, which Disney is famous for.  I recently went to the theater to see Narnia(King Caspian) which I was somewhat disappointed how it started out, where the kids just suddenly found themselves in Narnia, but the remaining movie was very comparable.

"""The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a wonderful film that the entire family will enjoy.  Since I have not read the books, I am basing my review only on the film.  In this tale, the four Pevensie children are cast into the magical world of Narnia via the Professor's wardrobe.  Once inside, the children learn that they are part of a prophecy that will lift the dark curse of the White Witch and save Narnia's magnificent inhabitants.As another reviewer stated, one of the first things that I noticed about this film was how the entire young audience remained quiet throughout the entire film.  In fact, the only real noise in the theater was the whimpers of younger children afraid of what happens to Aslan the lion in the film.  That's a difficult thing to do these days, especially since most kids are either easily distracted or their parents ignore them or don't even take them to the movies, preferring to drop them off at the kiddie show whilst they take in other fare.The story is wonderful.  I've read and watched interviews with the producers, directors, actors, etc. in this film and all of them were posed the obvious ""Christian"" questions about the film.  It's apparent that Disney wanted to tone down the ""Christian"" quotient in the film since most of the answers to the Christianity questions were downplayed.  However, C.S. Lewis' Christian aspects in this film are very evident, and I have nothing but praise for Disney for taking a chance and allowing the Christian themes to flow freely throughout the film.  Okay, so a few athiests and non-Christians will miss out on a wonderful adventure due to their prejudices.  As far as I'm concerned, it's their loss.  The Christian aspects of this story are key to its development and if you are only remotely familiar with the Gospels, you will quickly pick up on the symbolism of the four children, the White Witch, and, the most obvious of all, Aslan.There are moments of humor in this film that give youngsters a break in the rather high drama of this tale.  Most of that humor is provided by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, although young Lucy Pevensie almost steals the show with her cheery mood and big, innocent eyes.  The love between the children in this film is almost non-existent in movies these days, and it is refreshing to see a family that actually loves one another.There is also a rather violent aspect to this film.  This violence is doled out by the White Witch and her minions.  There are a number of creatures in this film that will likely frighten younger children, though the outcome of the battle between good and evil should settle most of their fears.  In fact, the only truly scary moment in this film occurs during the sacrificial sequence of a particular character.  In all honesty, this twenty-nine-year old almost broke down and cried at this pivotal moment in the film.  Of course, as a Catholic, this particular part of the film means a little bit more to myself than it may to others.  Also, the action and violence is primarily shot in close-ups, with a few exceptions.  One character does die a rather swift death that is visible to everyone, but most of the other deaths are dealt with tastefully and on a level that most kids can handle.The special effects are very, very exceptional.  Though not quite up to par with ""Lord of the Rings"" in the effects department, I have to admit that the effects are rather brilliant since there are many more talking animated creatures in this film than in ""Rings.""The actors and actresses in this film, especially the youngsters, are wonderful.  The two oldest Pevensie children, Peter and Susan, are played by William Moseley and Anna Popplewell.  Moseley's character takes on a father-figure role and while he often hesitates when making decisions, he always does what he feels is right for his siblings.  Popplewell, though sometimes motherly, is best seen as the protective older sister.  She has a deep connection to her little brother and sister and accepts them wholly, good and bad aspects combined.  Skandar Keynes plays Edmund, the ""prodigal son"" of the four children.  His character probably develops more than any other in the film.  Young Georgie Henley nearly steals this entire film as little Lucy Pevensie.  Her innocent curiousity gets the ball rolling in the adventure, and her face lights up the screen time and time again.  Aslan is voiced by Liam Neeson.  There should be no other choice in my opinion.  His voice gave Aslan a regal quality, yet you could feel the fear within him when he makes a key decision in the film.  Tilda Swinton rounds out the cast of key characters as the sinister White Witch.  She lures young Edmund into her trap with ""sweeties"" in an attempt to prevent the prophecy from coming true.  She is cold and calculating, and her battle with Peter is one of the most exciting bits of this picture.This film will keep everyone's eyes glued to the screen.  For those who consider this film boring or childish, I'm betting that those particular people are, for the most part, non-Christians.  I'm not attacking anyone in particular, but if you don't have the ""tolerance"" to look past something that might be offensive to you, then you aren't as tolerant as you demand others to be.If you are a Christian, I suggest you let your children watch this film, no matter what their age.  Trust me, it's a lot easier on the eyes and the heart than ""The Passion of the Christ.""  If you simply enjoy wonderful fantasy tales like ""Lord of the Rings,"" then this movie is right up your alley.  Highly recommended and I will definitely purchase this film when it comes out on DVD."	5.0	A Brilliant Tale For The Entire Family	2005-12-18	5	3	2

Instead, they give us Tolkien-lite.  The CGI is rather heavy-handed at times, lacking the exquisite touches that have been used in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and in the two more recent Harry Potter movies.  There are also a few sloppy directorial decisions: no blood on anyone's weapons, all the centaurs look alike (not surprising as they are all played by the same four or five actors), and the one that annoyed me the most--Lucy's potion can cure a gut-wound, but not a split lip and a bruise.  Please.On the other hand, this was a beautiful illustration of a much-beloved series, even if Disney didn't give it all the attention it deserves.  Kudos to the casting-folks for picking four children who look like they could be siblings, and for finding four older actors who look astonishingly like their ""younger selves.""  Also, thanks for SHOWING the battle.  C.S. Lewis seems to have shared his buddy Tolkien's squeamishness about action scenes, particularly violent ones; in the book, the battle lasts two and a half paragraphs, while the passage with the friggin' beavers drags on for about two chapters.  It was interesting to see the scale of the battle.  It illustrated the seeming hopelessness of Our Heroes plight, just as Peter Jackson brought the book-lackluster Helm's Deep darkly to life.  (An aside: I was glad to see quite a few lady-centaurs there on the front lines.  Also, the arrow-phoenix was much, much cooler than Fawkes.  Nice work, there.)Tilda Swanson was ""beautiful and terrible"" as the White Witch.  While I'm sure it would have been tempting to show the character as lovely and sharp as an icicle, the director presents us with a woman who looks less ethereal and more like an ancient Celtic Warrior-queen, complete with dreadlocks and a chainmail-and-fur gown.  She IS a warrior queen, who fights with sword and magic both in the battle, and a demented part of me couldn't help admiring her, even while I shuddered at the horror of her.Liam Neeson did a decent job as Aslan.  Not a lot to do with that character: he appears, he dies, he comes back, and he leaves.  I DID love the last little moment of the battle, when he and the witch look into each other's eyes.  Facinating.All in all, a B+ effort.  I hope that Disney will devote a little more energy to the next one than they do these stupid ""Cars"" movies."	4.0	Three and a half stars, really.	2005-12-14	9	2	7
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	Imagination is a powerful word with a direct connotation to creative ability, an ability that often has provided mankind with numerous wondrous achievements from literary works to straight technical inventions.  C.S. Lewis, the creator of the fantasyland Narnia, displayed a vast imagination while also borrowing from his life experiences in Roman and Greek mythology, Christian beliefs, and his adoration for Beatrix Potter's fables.  The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe presents C.S. Lewis' first book in a sequence of seven books portraying the life and struggle in Narnia that thoroughly displays his use of imagination, as it now offers the world a terrific cinematic experience about the continuous struggle between good and evil.The adaptation from the book, as mentioned, presents a faithful illustration of C.S. Lewis' world of Narnia.  It also puts forth a genuine touch from the real world from which Pevensie's come from, as the Luftwaffe terror bombs London in the opening.  These bombings force the mother to send her four children, Lucy (Georgie Henley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Peter (William Moseley), as so many others did during the World War II to the safety of the British countryside.  Nevertheless, to their dismay, the Pevensie children end up with a reclusive professor and his authoritarian housekeeper that demands utter silence and complete calmness.  To expect constant silence and calmness from children is suffocate children from experiencing childhood and the fabulous time of constant imagination - a time when C.S. Lewis familiarized himself with Beatrix Potter.In boredom, the four children find different things to preoccupy their repressed presence in the Victorian home of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent).  One of the things is hide-and-seek, which leads the youngest of the four, Lucy, to hide in a wardrobe with fur coats.  However, the children's game of hide-and-seek turns into an extraordinary adventure for Lucy who uncovers that the wardrobe is a portal to a fantasyland called Narnia.  She befriends a faun, also known as a satyr in Greek mythology, whose name is Mr.Tumnus (James McAvoy).  The notion of beware of strangers emits strong warnings in Lucy's encounter with Mr.Tumnus, but it also teaches a lesson of friendship and trust.Eventually, when Lucy returns she has been gone for several hours, but only a brief second has past in the real world.  A happily excited Lucy wants to share her discovery, but they find that the wardrobe is only a wardrobe and not a portal, which leads the other siblings to think that her imagination is working overtime in the boring house.  Nonetheless, the four siblings will eventually find a way into Narnia that will bring them on a suspenseful adventure of treachery, love, friendship, and many other righteous qualities.  Somehow, the lives of the four siblings are connected with the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who has deceived the nave Edmund, the younger brother, to bring his sisters and brother to her castle in false promises of Turkish Delight (sweets) and a throne.  The White Witch's true intentions are to kill the siblings, as they pose a threat to her. Meanwhile, in the south, Aslan is returning with an army with which he will try to destroy the White Witch icy grip of Narnia, as she also hunts the siblings on their escape south.Having read these books and in the light of recent year's releases of the Lord of the Rings, the expectations for this film mounted.  It got to a point where slight apprehension and uneasiness emerged, as C.S. Lewis has provided some of the fondest memories from my childhood when reading these books late at night anticipating the next turn of events within the next page.  It is with joyfulness and excitement that I must say that Andrew Adamson captured the feeling of C.S. Lewis' fantastic Narnia adventure.The two dear friends J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis lived and worked in the same town where they share many conversations, as members of the Inklings, a University of Oxford discussion group.  They probably shared their thoughts about right and wrong, mythology, and society among many other topics.  They both were Christians, professors, writers, and creators of imaginary distant lands.  However, one of them was to become the greater while the other would live in the shadow of his friend.  This was the case with C.S. Lewis, as he never accomplished the equal greatness of J.R.R. Tolkien.  The stories of Tolkien are more fluent, detailed, and unique while Lewis' stories emit a sense of familiarity, as they openly borrow elements from other cultures' mythology.  It is the commonness of Lewis that ushers him into the shadow of Tolkien.There is also, unfortunately, some slight awkwardness in how the four siblings behave in situations of high stress, as the psycho-emotional aspect of the film seems to suffer slightly.  However, C.S. Lewis' book and the film present the children in the way he wished children to be, as quiet, obedient, and well-mannered miniature adults with a high level of curiosity and imagination.  On the other hand, Tilda Swinton performs, as the White Witch, with energetic charisma and radiating darkness and evil that completely contrasts the innocence of the four children.  The performances between the children and Tilda Swinton balance extraordinarily well and in the end, remove any of the possible cinematic discomfort between the characters.Read in a Reuter article released by CNN, C.S. Lewis opposed his books shot in live-action while only allowing a reenactment in animated form.  However, ironically, I have a belief that he could not imagine the progress of cinematic technical achievement, which now can bring to life the creatures he visually generated in his mind.  The New Zeeland director Adamson takes on C.S. Lewis' brain-baby with delicate care, as he shot the film in live-action while incorporating computer-generated imagery that erases the memories of the cartoon The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1979).  In the end, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe presents a wonderful cinematic experience, but it lacks authentic imagination that creates uniqueness and originality to elevate it to brilliant piece of cinema.	4.0	A Wondrous Journey through the Wardrobe and Back...	2005-12-16	6	4	2

Beginning with the Battle of Britain, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, is the story of 4 children who find themselves in the magical land of Narnia, where they are the hope talking animals and other fantastic creatures.  Narnia has been under the spell of the evil white witch, who blanketed the land in perpetual winter. Of course, the children with the help of Aslan, the king of the beasts, defeat the White Witch and become kings and queens of Narnia.  THe plotline may seem simple, but overall this movie is just fantastic.  The children , particularly Georgie Henley, who plays the pivotal character Lucy, are excellent in their roles.  There are moments of pure magic, like when Father Christmas arrives or when Lucy first stumbles into Narnia.  While some liberties have been taken with specifics of the story, even the most dedicated of Lewis fans should be happy with this movie.  Like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe stays true to the vision of CS Lewis, creating a magical tale that is the best movie of 2005.	5.0	Excellent Adaptation of the Lewis classic.

Don't throw yer Bibles at me!That twist of the title is just a bit of fun, and by no means is a measure of my opinion of the film. ;-DIn Dec.2005 I had the opportunity to attend a free screening of the new film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, at the AMC Theatre, at The Block of Orange, in CA..All across the country Christian Churches were buying up whole screenings so that their parishners, and members of the community at large could see the film.One such church was Elements Church, an Assembly of God Affiliated Congregation known as The Church at the Block.I have never read any of the Narnia Books, but was aware of the Christian, or at least religious, themes of the series.I am not the most religious of people, but do enjoy a good religiously themed film, and the occasional book.From what I understand the books were not published in Chronological order of the events they tell about.It seems that what order to read them is controversial to many.Some say that reading them Chronologically...""makes the books more strictly allegorical than they really were intended to be, and gives the impression that they are an extended allegory rather than incidental allusions.""I'll leave that to folks who have read them to squabble over as you can discover by reading the excellent book reviews on Amazon, and other sites.Being a fan of Fantasy Films, and expecting this one to be a quality production of the genre, I looked forward to seeing it.The Actors?Unifomally quite good, especially Swindon as the Witch, and the 2 Boys.The youngest child actor only had to run around smiling at everything she encountered, cry a few times, and then spoil the reality of the effects of w ( Ah, but to say more would spoil things. ).The other human actors made little impression in their moments on screen:The loving Mom, the Housekeeper with a ""Thorn up her Butt"" attitude, and the Absent-minded Prof who, in the end, maybe knows more than he lets on.The actor who played the Witches dwarf lacky was a hoot.The Actor who played Santa was not playing him as the Jolly Ol' Elf, and that's a good thing.The Animals, and the actors who played/voiced them?All the main animal characters were realistically drawn, and given voices, and personalities, that kept you interested, and entertained.The actor who plays the pivital character Fawn was quite good.The bickering, though loving, Beavers were a hoot, and the wolves suitably menacing.Aslan, the Lion was suitably mysterious, commanding, and royal.The other animal characters, of a fantasy nature, were well drawn, and adequate to their various parts in the film, mostly as soldiers, and camp follwers.The Effects, and Cinematography?Impressive, and beautifully done.The landscapes were beautiful to behold.The rendering of various unfortunate characters turned into frozen Gargolyles by the witch lent a sense of menace to the proceedings.The Climactic Battle was as violently hectic, and impressively staged as any Fantasy, or Medieval, battle ever filmed, though bloodless ( By that I mean that this wasn't Braveheart, Gladiator, or the Lord of the Rings films. ).The Story?Fans of the books, like with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, know what's going to happen, and have various expectations, and for the most part people seem satisfied with the result as presented.Those inclined to see the religious elements see them in spades, and will spend hours happily talking them up in Church, and on Blogs, and online forums.For people like me, though, various things, in the end, detracted from total appreciation of the whole.But to say why in the way the subject deserves would be a major spoilerfest, and you would hate me for it in the morning. ;-DMy rating for this film should actually be 3 1/2."	3.0	A flawed, but well made, fantasy adventure	2006-12-09	37	1	36

The most important thing that was achieved is that the producers of this film captured the essence of Narnia.  You really feel like you've been to Narnia and to me that makes the film tremendously powerful.  The death and resurrection of Aslan were really fantastic, and I also especially liked the Lucy/Tumnus meeting and also when the children grew up in Narnia and were looking for the White Stag.  How did they get adult actors who looked SO much like the children, I'd like to know?!  Well done!  Georgie Henley was terrific in this movie and really stole the show.  She was the perfect Lucy.  The casting for this film was really well done. The only character I did not care for was The White Witch.  In other movie versions, perhaps the role is ""over-played"" and so because of that the role seemed to be ""under-played"" in this case.  I don't know if a happy medium exists to be truthful.  The producers did maintain the Christian symbolism, that C.S. Lewis called ""a supposal"" not an allegory, but this was not overly obvious.  The film certainly can be appreciated in  different ways.Some of the minor changes to the storyline and dialogue did irritate me, just because I know the novel SO well.  I would have liked more of Lewis' humour to be maintained instead of the humour that was added by the screenwriters.  Most noticeably is the absence of the development of Mrs. Beaver with her cute statements about the bread knife & sewing machine.  They also removed the scene in which the animals were having a party with food & drink given to them by Father Christmas - you know the part where the witch turns them into stone.  Instead they developed the fox character and used him alone in this altered scenerio.  I felt some of the dialogue & scene changes were a little unnecessary from a purist's perspective.  Some of the scenes also seemed rushed to me and I would have liked to see the hideout ""for beavers in bad times"".  I know, they had a time limit and actually the movie is over 2 hours which is longer than most movies.  What they did with the time they had was really really well done.  Hopefully we'll get some of these ""deleted scenes"" on the dvd.As someone else mentioned, there is a surprise 30 seconds into the credits that you will not want to miss.Some parents have expressed concern about the violence quotient, but I went into the movie with a 7-year old in mind and I think it will be okay for MOST younger children.  There are the battle scenes and they show one person being killed with an arrow.  However, they never dwell long on the battle and no blood is shown.  The other part that is disturbing is the part with Tumnus in the dungeon and the implication is that he was tortured.  That was rather upsetting and of course Aslan being killed was also very scary.  But, they have presented these tastefully & sensitively.  Actually the previews for other Disney films were more scary than the main attraction! :-)My overall impression - EXCELLENT and I hope they make all 7 books into movies."	5.0	Excellent but Minor Changes will Irritate Avid Fans of the Novel	2005-12-10	512	446	66

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2W6SI073FIRMA	KlownArt	"The Chronicles of Narnia- The Lion, The Witch, and The WardrobeWhen this movie originally came out is theaters I was euphoric. I was overjoyed and I had never read the book. The previews portrayed this as a more vibrant version of Lord of the Rings. Luckily, my church took a group of us to see the movie in a nearby theater. After a full, undivided view of the film, I felt disappointed with what I had seen. The movie compared in no way to Lord of the Rings. However, I have now watched it on DVD without the expectations of it being anything other than The Chronicles of Narnia. I enjoyed it much more without the strong comparison to Lord of the Rings.""Spectacular epic film-making fills the screen and your heart,"" says John Siegel of Good Morning America. He must have put on rose goggles before watching this one to make that kind of an overstatement. Narnia is a great fantasy story that is unfortunately hurt by length and bizarre cutting. I did walk away from this one wanting more though. If you are into the fantasy genre, you will want to add this to your collection.Four young children: Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter are sent away from a German blitzkrieg. Many children at this time were sent away from battle zones to ensure their safety. They are sent to live with a mysterious professor in a country estate. While playing a game of hide-and-go seek, Lucy enters a spare room with nothing but a wardrobe in it. Lucy attempts to hide in the Wardrobe and finds the gate to Narnia inside of it. Soon the other children enter the world. A Narnia prophecy says that when two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve enter Narnia, the world will be safe again. Safe from what you may be asking yourself. Narnia has been controls by a tyrant known the White Witch. She can manipulate ice. Narnia is now completely frozen by her. All that stood in her way have fallen.The children's only hope is to find the former ruler of Narnia, Asland. Asland has magically reappeared after thousands of years due to the humans entering Narnia. There is a war brewing between Asland and the White Witch. The four human children are the key to who will win this war.There are almost a million film devices in this movie. Symbolism reigns supreme with many symbols that relate to the bible. Asland represents God or Jesus Christ. One of the children will have to make the choice between good and evil. Asland forgives those who betray him. It is obvious to anyone who has knowledge of biblical events. No one else will notice it. There is also a lot of foreshadowing in this film. The talk about ""always winter, no Christmas"" foreshadows later events in the movie, and those events foreshadow later events. I like all these devices in a movie. Considering this came from a book, I understand where all these devices came from.Narnia is horribly cut up though. The film seems to jump from one scene to a future scene instantly. There is no explanation as to what happened between the two times. At one scene, Peter kills a wolf and Asland tells him to clean his sword. Suddenly they jump to him being knighted in the same place. It looks like a horrible cut from one scene to another. I usually would never say this, but this movie needed more fluff. It feels like the movie could have been at least twice as long for a complete presentation.The acting in this movie is mixed. I really liked Lucy, Susan, and a few other characters. Peter and Edmund are not the best actors though. They just seem generic and do not respond correctly to certain scenes. They seem to keep a straight face the entire movie or respond incorrectly.The extras are decent, but nothing special. There is a blooper reel that lasts a few seconds. You can turn on fun facts during the movie. There are also two separate commentary tracks. One is with the kids and director, and the other is a filmmakers' commentary. At the end of the movie, you are sick of the kids' voices though. They are interesting, but do not bring this movie up.If you are into the fantasy genre, or have read the books, check this one out. Everyone else should find some other movie. The awkward cuts and mixed acting will keep you annoyed, but the story will keep you wanting more."	3.0	Cool Fantasy Story, Bad Cutting and Length	2008-09-21	5	4	1

The four Pevensie children, Peter, Edmond, Susan, and Lucy, are sent to live in a big house owned by an old professor.  One day they discover an old wardrobe in the attic...that just happens to be the portal to the magical kingdom of Narnia.  There, it is always winter, but never Christmas, thanks to the evil White Witch.  Opposing her is King Aslan, mighty lion and defender of all that is good.  The children must gather all their courage as they prepare for the final battle between the two sides.Almost everyone and everything we see is CGI, which is stunning!  The four children are natural and convincing. The first half of the story is very slow but the huge finale is worth the wait.  CGI Aslan is such a  sympathetic creature that there were few dry eyes in the theatre during his big scene,  and the Christian allegory is quite touching.  This is a very satisfying film for Narnia fans of all ages.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1ZT7XVHM7SDRW	Kristyn O.	I saw this film when it came out because I liked the book a lot. When I first saw it, I liked it, but I did not love it. In my 10th grade year, my drama class watched this film and...actually, I liked it a lot more. And now it is one of my favorite films. Is the film better than the book....eh, I don't know. You decide. The story is about 4 kids named Peter,Susan,Edmund,and Lucy who have been sent to live in the home of a professor due to the war. One day,Lucy finds a wardrobe that leads her to a magical world named Narnia. She eventually leads her siblings into the wardrobe and then realize that they have to fight The White Witch. There are a lot of great performances. Tilda Swinton is great as the White Witch. She manages to be threatening and intimidating all at the same time. Though I must admit, her costumes are a bit Lady Gaga-ish. Any who, the performances of the kids are excellent, especially from Georgie Henley. This film is Lucy's story, and we see it from her eyes. And Henley carries the story all the way through. The score is outstanding. Especially the battle sequence. The soundtrack is so good in fact, I actually have it on my Zune. The special effects are very good, and there are some very creative moments and character designs. There are some flaws, but other than that, this is a wonderful family film that pushes the envelope. And it is just a fun family adventure. I highly recommend this film	5.0	A fabulous film. A great family flick	2012-03-09	0	0	0

Since the movie contained many allegories it could be called a story within a story which lends itself to much learning for kids and adults alike.

It was such a brilliant film, I can't wait to watch it over and over. I loved each of the four childrens acting and it was so refreshing to see actors that haven't acted in a dozen films before. They each deserve a breakdown.William Moseley- He was totally believable as his role of Peter. He was the perfect big brother and his character really grew through the movie. At the begining of the film you can't quite see how he will lead an army but he really met the challenge.Anna Popplewell- Didn't you just love that english accent. She was really great as Susan. Rather bossy and sassy to begin with until her talk with Lucy at the stream.Skandar Keynes- Yup, he was the bratty kid from the book. He just had those eyes that you could tell were mischevious.Georgie Henley- personally my favorite from the movie. No previous acting and yet she had a magic to her that was captivating. She had the imagination of Lucy and you could her sense of wonder in Narnia.Narnia was simply the best movie of the year and to me one of the best alltime.	5.0	Best Movie of the Year - Period	2005-12-22	8	5	3

They act like they see fauns and talking beavers every day.  The beavers look like giant rats.  You can easily tell what was CG and what was not.  I have no idea why they got Andrew Adamson to make this movie.  He made Shrek and Shrek 2.  Why not get a qualified director.  Narnia also seems to be an island where you can get everywhere in a day or two.  The kids go all over Narnia in a day or two.  And why does the professor look like the KFC guy?There are some good things in this movie though.  Aslan looks great and Liam Neeson was the right voice.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"I saw the BBC production of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" the first installment of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" by C.S. Lewis, and even though it had an animatronic Aslan the magic worked because everybody treated it as if it were alive. That same principle holds true for the theatrical version that opened today. The four siblings who enter the land of Narnia through the wardrobe accept what is happening and where they are as well as the responsibilities that fall to them in that land, and we believe as well. This is also because the children come across as being real, consistent in their personality traits until they learn better or the situation compels them to grow up accordingly.The four Pevensie children are sent by their mother from a London that is being blizted nightly by Nazi bombers to stay in the country with Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent). They are under instructions from the housekeeper, Mrs. MacReady (Elizabeth Hawthorne), to basically do none of the things that children do. It is while playing a game that is probably forbidden that the youngest, Lucy (Georgie Henley), discovers there is more to the wardrobe in the spare room than meets the eye. Her siblings, Peter (William Moseley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) do not believe her until they see for themselves. But then they discover that the magic that is Narnia is not as white as the driven snow when they meet up with the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).Unlike many of these big production children's movies this one is filled with mostly unfamiliar faces. Popplewell is the only one of the kids with more than a single credit. Broadbent is the most recognizable face, but he has a minor part. James Cosmo, who plays Father Christmas, will look familiar but few will place his name and there will be those who swear that it is Cate Blanchett who is playing the White Witch. Liam Neeson is cast perfectly as the voice of Aslan and once you recognize it is him you can forget who is doing the voice and just enjoy the story. Similarly, when Aalan makes his sacrifice the Christian allegory of Lewis' story becomes patently obvious, but the story still works for those who see Azlan and think of ""The Lion King"" rather than Jesus Christ. That is why ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is the most powerful and popular Christian allegory of the 20th century, and why few fans will find fault with this cinematic adaptation.Director Andrew Adamson helmed all of the ""Shrek"" movies, where the pop culture references flew fast and furious. In this film he casts his creative net even further in bringing together familiar images and magical moments. I was reminded of Dorothy discovering the Technicolor land over the rainbow in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the train trip to Hogwarts in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" and the great clash of armies from ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."" When the Witch shows up in her polar bear drawn chariot I was reminded of Frank Frazetta's cover painting for ""The Eternal Warrior"" and the last time we see Aslan recalls Mary Stevenson Parker's inspirational poem ""Footprints."" So a lot of what is in this movie will resonate with a lot of viewers, which is totally fitting given the chronicles related by Lewis.They did a superb job on the packaging for this two-disc collector's edition.  The DVDs are in a case that has nothing on the cover but the wardrobe, which I learned has carvings that tell the story of ""The Magician's Nephew,"" which is Lewis' prequel to this story.  That fits into a box and when you remove it reveals Lucy in Narnia by the lamppost in the snow.  Disc 1 has the movie and the blooper reel.  You can watch the movie again with commentary by either the kids and the director or by other filmmakers for more of the technical aspects.  You can also turn on the Narnia Fun Facts that will pop up throughout the film.  Disc 2 has featurettes representing the two world of Narnia.  Creating Narnia has bits that look at the director, the children, the creation of the film, the life and work of C.S. Lewis, and various cinematic storytellers.  The common denominator here is that this was clearly a labor of love.  Then the Creatures, Lands & Legends part looks at the various creatures from legend that populate Narnia.  Final Note: Be sure to watch the credits because there is a scene right after the cast credits.  Plus, there is an Alanis Morisette song, ""Wunderkind"" to listen to as well to let the movie play out to the end."	5.0	The first of C.S.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3LOXOMPX3ZPRK	"Lawrence Brown ""Larry Brown"""	"For what should have been a sweet movie, this was too mean. Peter was too mean to his little brother Edmond, for example, and Beaver was too mean to his wife Queenie. I'm not entertained by squabbling.Obviously, this is a story preaching a Christian viewpoint. In the Christian worldview, pride is a key offense against God. Yet this story plays to the viewer's pride by enticing him with the promise of gaining royalty, by constantly addressing Edmond, a symbol for all of God's children, as ""Your Majesty.""Britains (the author, C. S. Lewis, lived in Great Britain) or other cultures may fantasize about being royalty, but to this American's ears addressing anyone as ""Your Majesty"" sounds offensive. All men are created equal, you have to earn your own way, you're not born into it. This is another way in which the movie lost my support.The mixing of fantasy and religion was the key offense of this story. It has the effect of elevating secular mythology to the same level as Christian concepts. If you are trying to teach Christian truth it seems you would want to create as large a separation as possible between truth and fiction, but this story blurs the two and melds them into one. This story puts Santa Clause at the same level as Jesus Christ.The movie makes liberal use of spook house style startles, for example when Beaver comes out of the woods. That's formulaic, not art. You build up tension by building up the music, have a character look suspiciously about at some small sound in the dark, then *BOO* you have an orchestra hit while the cat jumps out at you. That may be ok for young people, but I expect much more than that of a movie director.On the good side, the special effects and the digital animation are excellent, the animated lion is excellent, and the cinematography is impressive.I liked the actress that played the little girl, I thought she did a nice job."	3.0	Great production, but too mean, cheap thrill shots, appeals to pride, presents religion as myth	2006-03-01	52	3	49

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3JYY3CMXSS5OE	legendary amazon reviewer	I am a great fan of the Chronicles of Narnia. Basically this a good movie, the effects are great and so are the actors. But this movie has a serious flaw. Because the Narnian stories are not huge action stories, C.S Lewis relied on depth,feeling,and magic to make his stories the classics they became. Unfortunatley, the movie is robbed of much of the magic that made the story a classic. For example,the witch is turned from an evil and cunning sorceris into a cruel and unstopable warrior queen, Aslan is devoid of his power and authority and is little more than a imposing talking lion. And the movie is minus some of the most powerful scenes in the book. From the battle to the end of the movie was excellent, but the rest of the movie just didn't compare to the book or the audio cd. Final point- don't watch this until you read the book and listen to the dramatised cds by focus on the family. See you on my next review of the 2003 movie Hulk.	4.0	great movie, but missing to much magic.	2008-06-13	0	0	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2XTJPD03BAK1	L E WILLIS	I love all the books.  I have read them to my children several times.  The movie is very close to the book.  What helps to accept the slight changes made is the control Donald Grishem had over the project.  We bought the DVD with the extra bonus material on it - it is well worth it.  My boys enjoy watching the bonus material as much as the movie.  It helps explain why the movie, the director made a few slight changes from the book.  These slight changes only enhanses the story.  I am amazed at the pettiness of some viewers who are upset over the slightest detail not being exactly like the book. Regardless of the changes, it is a beautiful movie that captures the essence of CS Lewis' masterpiece.  The musical score is perfect, moving, thrilling!  I am a musician and I am picky about film scores.  I'm not very happy about the music for the credits, though.  It does seem a little out of place.  But that's all.  As for Aslan's voice, Aslan is three dementional, therefore it is important that he not sound like Darth Vader.  Liam does a tender, commanding, and emotional portrayal of Aslan. The children are very good, spontaneous, refreshing.  Peter holds the four children together as we see him grow from his insecurities into a king.  There have been some complaints that Susan is too mean.  Susan is not mean, however the actress needed to portray her such that it is no surprise in the later books when Susan chooses not to believe in such childish things, therefore, never going back to Narnia.  It works well in the movie.  The spirit of Narnia lives in this movie and in all the characters, actors, and crew who worked hard to make it live.  One must feel somewhat sorry for others so wrapped up in the letter of Narnia that they do not catch or feel the spirit of Narnia.  I think Aslan would just shake his head in wonderment.  As far as CS Lewis - I feel strongly he would approve of his masterpiece and would be thrilled with the slight changes, especially the end.  CS Lewis believed in the spirit of Narnia and had no ego regarding his work.To appreciate the White Witch you need to read Magician's Nephew.  The director portrayed her perfectly.  On the bonus material of the DVD, the director mentioned that he avoided a typical female villan such as wicked witch, evil queen.  Therefore he went for someone unexpected.  She was internally demonic and quietly seething which made her role more evil instead of playing her over the top.  The battle scene is her forte.  She is Jadis - tall, strong and twisted.As far as Disney - Disney marketed the film, but they were restricted from offering advice or making changes to the production.  This is marketed through Disney, but it is not a Disney film.  Big difference.  When others state it is a typical Disney film, they are mistaken.  Some complain that the characters are stock with the typical Disney villan and happy Disney ending.  Good grief, read the book!Now, for those true Narnia lovers - Focus On The Family has all of the Narnia stories recreated in a radio theater format with  actors, orchestrations and sound effects.  We have all of them and my boys, 16 and 12, still listen to them weekly.  It is a wonderful way to get to know the other books as well.Life's too short to miss out on Narnia.  Get the DVD and enjoy the story and the best bonus material I have seen yet.	5.0	BEAUTIFUL	2006-04-11	6	6	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3KB1H0S7T6JX1	L Gontzes	"I have to say that I am not familiar with any of the Narnia books or cartoons, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not ""know"" of Narnia prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!The Chronicles of Narnia, brings to the screen the story of four siblings, two boys and two girls, who get sent off to the countryside in an effort to get away from the war that is raging in the major cities. There they discover a secret portal in the form of a wardrobe that grants them entry into the magical kingdom of Narnia.  What they find on the other side is yet another war, only this one involves creatures found in myth...The acting is about average with the exception of Tilda Swinton, who just like in the movie Constantine (starring Keanu Reeves), carries out her performance very well.In addition, Liam Neeson's voice as Aslan was a great addition and was rather soothing.

They acted just as school children of that time period would act, at least to me anyway.Soundtrack that fit perfectly and complimented the story while not overwhelming the visuals and the acting.I really believed those animals were talking!  Surely some breakthroughs were made in CGI.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2AI58E0LX2IG2	"Lil Kara C ""KK"""	"""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" shows an adventure meant for families and all ages to enjoy. Children notice the special effects and characters; adults can analyze the symbolic meaning of the lion and the White Witch. Although nothing directly parallels to the story of the bible, it comes very close. It is a very controversial issue, with many views and opinions. Aslan, the lion, is a god like character who comes to save Narnia from the White Witch who is trying to keep Narnia cold and icy forever. There is a scene where the lion (""god"") is to be killed by the witch in order to have peace in Narnia. This scene is the crucifixion like scene that has most people asking the question ""Is this movie one of Christian faith?"" The wardrobe represents a spiritual like realm. The characters Lucy, Edmond, Peter and Susan act as defenders in the battle between good and evil; they are the children of Adam and Eve. These factors represent Christian faith, and they show an amazing sense of adventure. For the younger audience there's the chance for imagination to take a hold. Narnia opens possibilities in young minds, which can further a child's thinking enabling them to be more open minded. Susan, the youngest sibling, wanders into the wardrobe during a game of hide and seek, to discover Narnia. The adventure takes off from there, allowing our minds to wander in this world of imagination. This film is definitely seen in different perspectives which make it easy for many people to enjoy."	5.0	Narnia: A World of Answers or Questions?	2006-03-09	10	5	5

When I saw this movie in theaters when I was 13, I fell in love with this movie instantly. But when I read the book, I was disappointed in it. I thought that the book was going to be much more epic than the film, like it usually is, but boy was I wrong. The book was so mild it felt like a 5 year old could read it due to the very little violence it contained. This is one of those rare instances in which the film is so much better than the book. A lot of people today crave the excitement from epic scenes and battles in movies and this is a great case in which it is just as beautiful as it is epic and I love those films to death.

But i must tell you it was a far cry from the interesting and creative colorful way they use to tell stories on fairy tale theater.  remember that? It started off slow, and then it picked up when she found the wardrobe into the magical forest, where she met and made friends with the human elk.  BUT THEN it went back to slow and boring as she found her way back home, tried to convince her brothers and sisters, of this magical place that she just found, where they all just happened to find it later by accident while playing hide and seek.Eventually they were all on a journey to stop the ice queen from keeping everything frozen all year as well as saving one of their brothers who wandered off into the arms of the ice queen while trying to betray his kin, all because of the queens promise to make him prince, and save the elk who was captured by her for not telling her that he saw the human girl in the forest in the first place.Anyway,  I was bored and unimpressed by the ""special effects, character's wardrobe, and boring setting,"" of this movie. In fact, I actually watched part of this movie one night, and it was so uncaptivating to me, that i watched the other half a few days later just to see if there was a chance it may pick up.  While i'm sure there has to be competition from another version of this film, i am not sorry that i bought it because i am an avid collector and if anything, i look at it as another movie version of it that i am able to have knowledge of and give my opinion on by comparing the lot. I give it 3 stars being generous, because of the story itself, not for the movie at all. I know they could have been more creative with this to make it a more magical experience.  If you are looking to buy this movie to entertain the children and keep them quiet, FORGET THIS MOVIE VERSION, i am sure you can find a more exciting version than this.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"Movie makers continually seek out new opportunities to show the world what modern technology can do.  It was probably inevitable that C.S. Lewis's books about Narnia would eventually become a film.  Fortunately, this version is nicely filmed and the special effects are phenomenal.  Avid fans will likely be disappointed because the film takes a lot of liberties with the plot, but everyone else will find this movie fun to watch.During the bombing of London early in World War II, many families sent their children into the countryside.  This plot device has been used in other movies, including at least one other well-known Disney movie, ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks.""  This movie focuses on four Pevensie children, Peter, Lucie, Edmund and Susan.  The four children are being boarded with Professor Kirke.  Professor Kirke is reclusive and eccentric.  The children eventually discover an old wardrobe that can lead to another world, a world called Narnia.Once in Narnia the children discover that they are part of a prophecy.  The children also learn much about themselves and develop many positive attributes, including compassion, trust, and responsibility.  Most importantly, they learn the power of love and caring for each other.  The children learn these lessons while helping the creatures of Narnia, including Aslan, their leader.Narnia is a magical place caught in a battle between good, represented by Aslan, and evil, represented by the White Witch, who aspires to be the Queen of Narnia.  The four children represent a change in the balance of power that has lasted for one hundred years.  Though the children have their doubts and fears, they have an opportunity to cast their fears aside and to help an entire world change for the better.I have seen many movies based on books.  The most difficult books to film are those based on fantasy because these stories typically rely as much on the characters as they do on the imagery of the stories.  Unfortunately, many film makers fail to understand the distinction between a good story and special effects.  Fortunately for us, the producer and director of this movie did understand the difference and they created a very enjoyable film to inspire us all.This film does have a fair amount of violence, and some younger children and most pre-school children should probably watch the movie only with a parent present.The DVD has a lot of special features.  The special feature that I enjoyed the most is the pop-up version of the movie.  All sorts of tidbits appear with this feature turned on that expand on C.S. Lewis's life and on the Narnia books.  The only problem with this feature is that there are lengthy periods when there are no pop-ups and I was a bit restless in the wait.""The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a very good adaptation of the first book of Narnia by C.S. Lewis.  The movie does take liberties with the plot and deviates several times from C.S. Lewis's story.  However, the movie does retain the flavor of C.S. Lewis's book and is a worthy addition to the film libraries of most families and those who enjoy a good fantasy film.Enjoy!"	4.0	Very Good Adaptation	2006-12-24	4	2	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A14Q2TSTDY6M44	"Lore ""Lore"""	"I watched this tonight on network television. It was painful. The Chronicles of Narnia were intended originally to deliver Christian themes by metaphor, but this production is gutted -- secularized -- stripped of depth and thematic richness.The storytelling is bad. Characters aren't developed or even explained. Parts of the movie that are expensive and extended, probably at great expense, should have been cut. Essential parts of the story are just missing.  Flow was better in the old child's cartoon.  Context is destroyed.Casting for the children is very good. They do a fine job of delivering edited lines. Mr. Tumnus is awful, resembling a disfigured reject from a teenage boy band. The witch is downright boring, lacking the menacing aspect and dramatic flair of the old cartoon design.  The theme of Good versus Evil is left dangling incomprehensibly amid pointless battle scenes.  There is no fear, no passion, no exultation, and no explanation, particularly at the most critical moment.My greatest criticism is reserved for the depiction of Aslan, voiced most distractingly by Liam Neeson. The Lord of Narnia should fit the description in the book: be bigger, more imperious, more grand, with a deeper, more powerful voice to fit the character, not to mention simple accoustics of big throat and lungs. The computer-generated lion is of a quality similar to the mannequins in Polar Express. Aslan deserves to be more than Liam Neeson's voice emanating from a lion-shaped marshmallow.Anthony Hopkins played author C.S. ""Jack"" Lewis in the movie Shadowlands, directed marvelously by Richard Attenborough.  That movie is a storytelling masterpiece of characterization and subtlety and devotion.

The film brings to life a certain enchantment that's hard to describe in words.  The music and the assortment of Narnia's characters are the definite working charms here.  That being said, I have one major complaint: this would have been much better had it been produced by a company other than Disney.I feared when I first saw the trailer that if Disney was behind the curtain, it would definitely be pandered toward the kiddies.  And don't get me wrong, it should be, it's that kind of book.  The story is fine, but I'm referring to the effects work.  This is one of the worst attempts at blending live action with computer imagery.  The animators took every opportunity they could to put their craft to work.  The purpose of blending computer graphics with live action is to pull off stunts not possible in any other aspect, and the computer imagery needs to be so believable that the audience will forget that it's an effect.  In the case of this film, every character that was not human was computer generated, and the result looks like it came from a Pixar animated film; something that really shouldn't happen in today's cinema, with today's technology.  I don't mind special effects, but when Peter Jackson and his crew turn out a phenomenally believable adaptation of Tolkien's classic, one comes to expect the same type of results from a similar type of movie.  The effects, while dazzling, just weren't realistic enough for me, and did remind me a bit of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.People who loved the movie would tell me to put a sock in it.  Hey, it was a pretty good movie as a first entry in what will probably become an ongoing series, like the books.  But there were times when effects probably wouldn't have been needed.  I've seen real animals ""talk"" countless times.  For heaven's sake, Dr. Dolittle used real animals.  I can understand certain aspects being digital, but in this case, a lot of the animation was overkill.  And while the beavers were cute, they, too, looked like walking Pixar creations that were leftover from an uncompleted project, and decided to leap over to a live action film.The other letdown was, while the actors were solid, I feel something was left out.  It's only a two hour movie, and believe me, it does feel like a full-blown story.  However, it felt like they were leaving some important details out, like they were moving the story too fast at certain points.  Somewhere in the middle, it felt like when you're at a restaurant, and the server brings out your food super quick so that you can hurry up, gulp down your food, and make room for the next available party.  Some of the film felt a bit rushed.On a positive note, there are some real emotional moments that the film pulls off quite well.  Aslan is a powerful character, although again, I feel too much of the story went by before he finally appeared.  For those who know the books like the back of their hand, there is a moment in the story that really comes off well.  And the witch was a strong villain, chilling and believable.So all in all, it's a film I feel very strongly about, as a fan of fantasy.  It's an enjoyable tale, filled with an indescribable wonder and magic.  It gets a B for plot, and a C for execution.  I just feel Weta or ILM could have handled the effects a lot better."	3.0		2005-12-10	17	6	11

Since then I have worn out two sets of paperbacks. I have read them so many times that my paperbacks are falling apart. I have been anxious for many years for someone to make a well made film of the Chronicles and I was thrilled when I found out that Disney was undertaking the challenge through Walden Media. Both are excellent film production companies. There are a few changes to the original story that I found a little irritating, but after waiting so long for something other than the 1970's cartoon and the very cheaply made and poorly acted BBC version, I didn't mind those changes much at all. The actors playing the four Pevensies were excellently casted, especially Lucy, who is absolutely darling and the special effects are stunning. Anyone who thinks it looks cheap or poorly made, I can only say to you that you must think it's easy to make half-human/half-animal creatures and talking animals look realistic.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	First I have to say I never read the original book, but this still seemed like a fair and well done attempt to bring the much-loved C.S. Lewis story to the screen. The characters were believable and the four children did a wonderful job with their roles. The special effects are stunning, the best I've seen since LOTR. The battle scene at the end between good and evil was a worthy climax to the film and I might even like it better than the final battle in LOTR. Another very cool thing was the adult actors looked very much like their childhood counterparts. It gets off to a bit of a slow start, and here and there you'll find a few other places where things drag a bit, but not for long, and the final 20 minutes of the movie are great, nonstop action, especially the big battle scene. Overall a fine movie and one that seems to represent well the famous Lewis story.	5.0	A brief comment	2005-12-23	6	2	4
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1W7DX6ZRKYKJI	Maketracts	Unfortunately in what I see as a short sighted money grab by Disney they have ruined perhaps the only remake we are likely to see for the next ten years, of this classic story. The original story has been secularised to remove the underlying Christian theme of the book, which has resulted in a poor version of an otherwise deeply rich classic. Such a shame they didn't find someone like Peter Jackson to make this! Unfortunately this is the best out of the three Disney remakes, the others being progressively worse. Bright and Disneyfied, the impression becomes one of a made for tv movie, especially in the later movies. How sad:( the worst thing is it is unlikely to be remade for a very long time, and people think they know the story now through these films but really won't. As for those who say its very close to the book, maybe a reread will be helpful.	2.0	Not for fans of the books!	2012-12-25	7	5	2

Lewis' books, so this review does not focus on how successful the movie was at capturing the essence of the book. Rather, it focuses on the 2 disc collector's edition and the movie as a whole.The movie amazed me with its special effects, animated creatures and landscapes (once again, New Zealand has got to have some of the most beautiful places on Earth). They were all beautifully captured through a blend of great photography work and computer animation detail, seamlessly complemented by the accomplishments of the production design, costume and props teams. My favorite animated characters, hands down, were the beaver couple and the Lion, of course. And among the nicest sets too was the beavers' house, which brought to mind Yoda's home from ""Empire Strikes Back"" (please don't ask me why).The story was interesting, but the way it was told in the movie, it had numerous moments (past the first half, most of them) where it felt a bit too forced in order to make things work. This took away from the first half of the movie, where there was plenty of detail to help justify the direction that things would take. Perhaps too many editorial cuts, perhaps a failure on the screenplay to capture some important elements: the end result feels a bit rushed (story-wise) and takes away from how believable Director Andrew Adamson (""Shrek"") wanted it to be.The work by the actors was fine, particularly the job done by Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes, the two youngest children actors (first timers, all) who played Lucy and Edmund, respectively. Tilda Swinton (from ""The Beach"" and many other movies) played a White Witch that worked, by staying away from clich&eacute;s. The Lion's voice, done by Liam Neeson, could not be better. It conveyed all the respect and fear (when needed) that the character required.The rest of the 2-disc set has plenty of goodies for the fans of C.S. Lewis and those who love to learn about the innermost details of the movie and its pre-production, production and post-production phases. As a whole package, it works, and it even offers two beautifully crafted and printed pieces of concept art (the size of a postcard) for the buyer to collect.Overall, things even out a bit in the end and the Special Two-Disc Collector's Edition of ""The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" lands a comfortable 4 stars out of 5."	4.0	Amazing animation and a good story, though it has some glitches	2006-04-03	3	3	0

I mean it's not a break off of it, it's based on a book that C.S. Lewis had written for children to get a better understanding of the Bible.  Yes there are talking creatures and creepy looking creatures but that gives you an idea what it's like with God on oneside and Satan on the other.  That is of course you like to look at it in a Christian perspectiveThis movie really does run parallel with the Bible, in a way.  You the White Witch, a.k.a Satan, and you have Aslan, a.k.a God.  One fights for freedom, the other fights for control.  Your basic good vs. evil battle. For the adults of course.For the kids there is the funny, talking animals.  Well some of them anyways.  There is no gore for all you ""I must see blood in order to like this movie"" so don't see it if you want to see blood everywhere.  There is adventure, the occasional dangerous encounters with the evil wolves, and the almost drowning in the river.I think the most scariest part for the kids probably is when Aslan goes to the Stone Table to sacrifice his life instead of Edmund.  It's a fightening seen with all the creepy goblins and strange looking creatures and of course the dopey elf-thingy who drives the White Witche's sleigh.  The fact that they don't show Jadis thrusting the knife into Aslan, just showing her with it poised over her head and then her claiming the ""Great Lion"" dead, is a big relief because I don't young kids would be able to handle that all.It's all really good movie and it does have good morals.  I do suggest though that kids who are really young shouldn't probably watch this because of scary monsters and intense scenes.  Otherwise, this is a wonderful movie for all ages and not a movie for people who love sex and gore."	5.0	A wonderful movie	2006-04-13	6	3	3

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	Ever since I first discovered Narnia in the third grade, I have loved this series of seven novels.  While I have read through the series several times, this book remains my favorite and I have read it more then any other.Naturally, when I first heard about this movie, I was excited.  I tried to keep a healthy skepticism about me since so very few movies live up to their books, but I couldn't help it.  I was counting the days until I got to see this.  And I was not disappointed in the least.Sticking fairly closely to the book, the story follows four siblings.  Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent to the countryside to live with a professor while the Germans bomb London during World War II.  While playing hide and seek one day, Lucy (Georgie Henley) hides in a wardrobe, only to find herself in a winter landscape.  Exploring a little more, she meets a faun named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy).  After serving her tea, he confesses his desire to turn her over to the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton).  The White Witch has turned his country of Narnia into a constant winter with no Christmas.Naturally, her siblings don't believe a word Lucy says when she returns.  A second trip with Edmund in tow doesn't help things.  But when all four of them wind up in Narnia, they find themselves caught in an epic battle between good and evil where they are prophesied to free Narnia from the White Witch's reign with the help of the great lion Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson).  But even if they can survive treachery in their own ranks, can four children really free Narnia?The movie expertly captures the spirit of the book while making lots of changes.  Those familiar with the original story will certainly notice a few changes already (hide and seek was the excuse the second time Lucy went, not the first), but these changes enhance the movie.  This is especially true in the middle third.  The trip from the Beaver's house to meet Aslan was much more harrowing in the movie and Edmund gets some extra scenes never dreamed of for the book.  The changes were actually necessary to make the story work for the movie.  Most of them help establish the changes the characters are going through, which is handled in the narration of the book.  Obviously, that isn't an option for the movie.As I said, these changes didn't bother me in the least.  I was so caught up in the story I didn't care.  The kids do an absolutely amazing job with the acting, especially since they are doing lots of acting to effects that won't be there until much later.  Georgie Henley, the youngest as Lucy, especially does a good job, which is important since Lucy has to carry so much of the early story by herself.  I was also quite satisfied with Aslan's voice.  Liam Neeson brings the right mix of majesty with reality to the role.  And Tilda Swinton's White Witch is equal parts creepy and evil without being over the top.The effects were amazing as well.  This movie could not have been made 5 years ago.  While a few of the creatures might look a little fake to some, I want to know where they found the talking beasts.  And the scenery, taken from locations all over the world but mostly New Zealand, was beautiful as well.Even though the movie is rated PG, parents will want to take the rating seriously.  There are several intense moments, especially the opening of London being bombed and the final battle.  In keeping with the PG rating, the final battle is (thankfully) blood free, but it might be too intense for kids.  Only you can judge for your family.Every hope I had for this movie was met or exceeded.  I hope they do all seven of the books.  In the meantime, I can not wait to see this one again.	5.0	Confessions of a Narnia Fanatic	2005-12-16	11	8	3
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A172T6KHPDPTOD	Mark Grinstein Cama	"Probably this film is going to come under a lot of attack for following the book too closely, but I think that it has rather the opposite problem:  it very often leaves out important information from the book, or show an event so differently that its entire context is changed.  For example, in the book, Peter and Susan had good reason to believe in the goodness of Aslan, because Lucy explained what she knew as soon as she could, and then the beavers explained all about him.  In the movie, no reasons are given for trusting Aslan; the children are just asked to trust him anyway, and when Peter finally does decide to believe in Aslan, no reasons are given for this change.And really, we just aren't told enough about either Aslan or the White Witch to give either of them the stature that they had in the books.  In the book, Tumnus explains to Lucy when she first enters Narnia that the eternal winter is caused by the Witch, but her rival is the powerful Aslan; later, when all the children are in the beaver's house, the beavers talk about just how powerful both the Witch and Aslan are, and Mrs. Beaver says that she would be surprised if the Witch could even look Aslan in the face.  (And when the Witch does that in the book, it's a very important moment!)  Not being told who Aslan and the Witch are reduces the story from a giant struggle between good and evil to a little fight between a magician and a magic lion.  (Hence my question, ""where are the explanations?"")Probably what most annoys me about the film is the battle scene.  Yes, there was a battle between Aslan's side and the Witch's side at the end of the book, but it was almost anticlimactic.  By the time that the battle took place, the Witch's spell of winter had already been broken, the children were all together, and Aslan had already come back to life and revived the critters that the Witch had turned to stone.  Things were overwhelmingly on Aslan's side, and it was over quickly.  The emotional turning points towards the end were at other places: Aslan's revival, Ed's redemption.  But apparantly, the Hollywood scriptwriters said, ""Oh, there's a battle between good and evil at the end.  Obviously, it must be a Big Important battle that costs $70 million to film!""  The battle is not only far longer than it needs to be, it's filmed in Lord of the Rings-style epicness, largely before Aslan has been revived, with undercurrents of ""The odds aren't on our side, but we will make it anyway!""  I love battles like that, but here it's utterly inappropriate and has nothing to do with what that battle meant in the book.Don't get me wrong; the film has much to admire and enjoy.  All of the children look just right.  The Witch's palace is made out of ice, which it wasn't in the book, but is visually stunning and a fabulous illustration of the Witch's power.  The Witch herself is perfect:  pale and icy, wearing a beautiful rich but stark grey dress, and absolutely kickass.  The Professor has a quirkiness only hinted at in the books, and some of his inflections and reactions foreshadow some of the other chronicles.  Aslan sometimes sounded too American, but for the most part was great.  Also, there are a few shots of the Witch fighting, first with her wand and a sword, then with two swords, that were fabulous.  Tumnus, the faun, is naked in the books; here he wears a red woolly scarf normally, and a gorgeous green velvet one for special occasions; I found this an amusing touch that completed his image well.And some of the book's best moments were carried out perfectly.  For example, in the book, Ed has a conversation with Aslan after he rejoins Aslan's side; this conversation is not actually in the book, but knowing how much Ed has to apologize for, it's probably one of the book's strongest moments.  The film just shows one shot of Ed and Aslan conversing, and we don't hear anything, but I thought it conveyed the scene beautifully.I do have some little quibbles:  the Witch's magic wand the she used to turn things to stone with looked more like a machine than a magical tool; she had to physically touch things for a certain amount of time for it to work.  In the book, I believe it was just a simple rod that she waved from a distance.  In the book, the beavers deduced where Ed had gone based on his behavior; in the movie, they actually see him entering the Witch's castle.  When the children and the beavers are running away from the Witch, they rely on the simple logistics of having started out sooner and knowing where they're going and where to hide; there are some pseudo-dramatic moments where they actually are running away from wolves that they can see in the movie, and similar tricks that I think take away from the effectiveness of the story.Overall, it's a good movie, certainly worth watching, but without the descriptions of Aslan or the White Witch, or the scenes in their proper contexts, utterly lacking the book's depth and richness."	3.0	where are the explanations?	2005-12-09	17	9	8

The young actors playing the children called upon to save the magical land of Narnia are first rate, especially the one playing Edmund who is able to convey absolute shame and despair with an expression. Liam Neeson conveys a tender majesty as the lion king Aslan, though he sounded a lot like Sean Connery to this reviewers ears. Tilda Swindon was icily evil as the Witch Queen.The CGI that rendered talking animals, mythical creatures, and the final epic battle was well done, not looking fake at all, indeed looking more advanced that even the eye popping effects of The Lord of the Rings.

It is a very close adaptation to the book only adding a few things that I believe helps the character devolopment for the children more than the book did. The CGI is great in most of the movie, other parts seem a little rushed through with the CG effects, but I really did not notice all that much because I felt like I was visiting an old friend. If you loved the books I am almost positive you will love the movie. If you did not like the books you will not like the movie. The allegory is intact, and I love it! These Messiah figures are in countless other movies like Matrix, E.T., Star Wars etc. but I do not see anyone winning about those. Aslan works for me, The White Witch and MR. Tumnus (are those His real legs? Amazing CGI on this guy!) is amazing. Lucy is a great actor so is The Professor.The other kid actors are so-so but Edmunds pretty good.Just remember to watch it with a childs eyes and know there is no blood.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O	"MartinP ""MartinP"""	"At first glance, the Narnia Chronicles seem to have it in them to occupy the middle ground between LOTR and Harry Potter; doing either of those one better by the promise of seven episodes... Unfortunately however, as Lewis's friend Tolkien already noticed, the Chronicles have one major flaw: they lack mythological consistency. Lewis freely populated Narnia with every fantasy creature that caught his fancy, so that we find Greek satyrs alongside talking beavers, and we also encounter Santaclaus, no less. Thus, the Chronicles are a charming, but essentially superficial fairy tale, not helped by burdensome christian overtones. Much the same goes for the movie. It is generally beautiful to look at, no doubt. CG animation went ahead of itself once again, and Aslan easily outdoes Gollum for startling realism. The winter landscapes are highly atmospheric, the kids are cute, and the animals fluffy. Yet overall design quality varies; the kids' coronation robes look distinctly cheap, and there are several scenes where moving characters against a matte background have an old-fashioned, flat, cut-out look. A more serious problem is the way the story races ahead without ever conveying any sense of necessity. Things only happen because they have been foretold. The children's swift adaptation to the world behind the wardrobe is not quite believable, nor is their equally fast emotional attachment to the creatures they meet. They will spill tears over a dead lion they only met a short while ago, but never once do we hear them talk about their mother (in fact, after their coronation they don't appear to have a single thought of going home). The London opening is original, but essentially irrelevant, and takes up too much time that would have been better spent on fleshing out the interpersonal relations between the Pevensies and the Narnians.That said, this remains good middle of the road entertainment for all ages except the youngest. The film's secret weapon is Tilda Swinton, who features as a magnificant White Witch, showing off some of the most gorgeous costumes seen in any recent movie. Her icy mien and vicious character supply much-needed drama. The acting of the children isn't half bad either, though slightly over-the-top at times, and with an ocassionally wooden delivery of the lines.The bonus disc offers the usual background documentaries geared to make the viewer believe that this is truly the most special and important film of all time. Like the movie, they are well-done without being spectacular. I guess we are not too far removed from the day when DVD-buyers will altogether loose interest in the umpteenth ""CG making of"" documentary; some of the creature creation episodes on this disc are all but interchangeable with those on, say, the LOTR discs, including the presence of Weta-man Richard Taylor."	3.0	Unspectacularly good	2006-04-09	7	1	6

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AG42CYU5P8NVQ	Mathew A. Shember	We saw this movie in the theater and it was beautifully shot film.  The scenery was beautiful and the special effects are superb.The story line is not a complete following of the book.  The changes are minor unless you are devout follower of the books.  Then the changes will annoy.I think they did a great job casting for the film.  The children did a great job.  Surprising is the adult actors which play the children grown up.  They looked like the children.Aslan was well done and Liam did a great job voicing him.I have heard this film labeled Lord of the Rings for children.  Probably a good description.  However, I would be careful with taking any children to this movie.The battle scenes can get intense.  However, you don't have overt blood splattering or limbs getting hacked off.  You do see creatures getting cut down and turned into stone.If your child is noise sensitive, the howl of Minotaur and Aslan might bother them.Aslan does die but is resurrected.Some people might be concerned about the Religious undertones.  CS was a very religious man and those that know the Religion can spot the meanings.  However, they are not enough to detract (if that description can be used) from the story.  When I read the books as a kid, I didn't pick up on them.There are extras on the DVD.  There are Bloopers which are ok.  There are commentaries that you can enable which do the popup info during the move.  Someday I might run through it.Overall it was a good film and it was enough to interest my wife to read the stories.	5.0	A good film!	2006-06-13	0	0	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3H2K3442NY63P	Matthew Pursley	"Now, while I could write a long and in-depth review of ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" I'm not going to. Most of what can be said about the story and the movie itself has been said already by other reviewers, so I'll try keep this short.The Narnia Chronicles have long been some of my favorite novels, and when I first heard that there was going to be a big-screen adaptation of the first story in the series, I was thrilled. Now that I've seen it, I'm even more thrilled. The movie-makers have done a very good job of adapting the novel to the screen, creating a film that is almost point-by-point faithful to the book. The acting in the film is superb, in some cases electrifying, and the chosen actors are good matches to their roles. I didn't notice the rushed feeling or inconsistent quality that some of the other reviewers mentioned. I think that the whole film is consistently very well done, and it definitely fulfilled my expectations. The Christian parts of the film were handled tastefully, neither heavier nor lighter than what is in the book. If I hadn't know the allegory was there, I wouldn't have recognized it as being allegory. It was just part of the plotline.The bottom line is that this is an enjoyable movie of high quality in all respects that I could see. It's great to see on the cinema screen, and it'll make a nice addition to my DVD collection later."	5.0	A very nicely done adaptation of a wonderful story.	2005-12-12	8	5	3

Lewis' children's classic, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" The child actors are good representations of the characters of Peter, Susan, Edward, and Lucy (with the caveat that Peter is perhaps a tad too glamorous), and the CG representations of the talking animals are terrific as are the fantastic and mythological creatures, both good and evil.  Aslan himself is a marvel, and wonderfully finessed CG together with Liam Neeson's marvellous voice bring him to life.  How Hollywood does with the subsequent movies (in whichever order they choose to portray them...prequel, and the rest...or otherwise) will depend on its faithfulness to the originals. But if they choose to loyally portray C.S. Lewis' books, I think they'll find the audience not only appreciative, but also as devoted as the fans of the Harry Potter novels currently are."	5.0	Narnia Everlasting	2007-02-18	1	1	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AFJCOP0GKZH6C	M. B. Trapp	"Since I'm such a huge C. S. Lewis fan, I'm a little ashamed that I waited over a month out from Narnia's release date to see it. Why did I do that? There are numerous reasons. One is that I have a new baby, so it's a bit hard to get out of the house, but that didn't stop me and my wife from making it out to the theater for the first week of King Kong's release. No, I think the real reason is because I was afraid that Narnia would be mediocre, and much of what I had heard from the Christian community backed that up, despite strong reviews from critics. The criticisms were numerous, but I'll list a few:The movie is only ""Lord of the Rings Junior.""It underrepresents or underexplains the character of Aslan.It waters down the book's religious allegory.The children are bad actors.The movie is a cheap attempt at cashing in on the success of The Passion of the Christ, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter by throwing all those films into a blender.And ad infinitum ...When my wife and I sat down in the theater on Sunday night, I was expecting no more than a mediocre film that reflected all of these criticisms or worse, another cheap translation of a classic work of literature, a rushed hack-job of a movie that exists for the sole reason of making money.I was way wrong. From the opening scene of the bombing of London to the final, ""Try me,"" from the professor, I was entranced. And ""entranced"" is not a word I use lightly. For a grown man who is a bit jaded at the current vapid Hollywood culture to be so mesmerized by a kids' movie with fauns, talking beavers, and Santa Claus is, to me, an astonishing thing.No one, least of all me, expected Narnia to be such a work of unusual dramatic power. I know there are many others who didn't see it that way, but considering the box office numbers, I think this movie resonated with many people. In fact, not only are Narnia's box office numbers good, it looks like it is actually going to beat King Kong as the holiday box office champ. No one saw that coming. Neither did anyone expect it to be third most profitable movie of the year, behind only the behemoths of Star Wars and Harry Potter, the latter of which may still be surpassed.My wife had the same reaction as I did. She even went so far as to say that the scene of Aslan's death is more powerful than the crucifixion of Jesus scene in The Passion of the Christ. I am tempted to agree. There is a moment when we see Aslan, alone, shoulders slumped as he walks to his doom under the moonlit trees. Something about this scene poignantly portrays the eternal loneliness that Christ must have felt as he pondered what it must be like to be abandoned by God the Father on the cross. When he asks the Pevensie girls to hold on to his mane as he walks because he ""could use the company,"" I was almost - pardon the cliche - moved to tears.I suppose that many of the criticisms came from the same sort of literary purists that went into a hysteria over every instance in the Lord of the Rings movies that weren't exactly the same as in the books. But this sort of thinking comes from a misunderstanding of the difficulty of translating from the literary medium to the film medium. Like any task of translation, it may be necessary to depart from a strict reading of the original material in order to keep the spirit of the material in the new medium.For example, take one of the primary criticisms from a recent review of the movie at The Decent Films Guide. The author, Steven Greydanus, seems to understand the difficulty in making the translation, and then second guesses the filmmakers on one minor change after another. For example, he takes issue with the fact that the film version of Peter is more of a reluctant hero than the book version:Take the depiction of Peter Pevensie, the eldest sibling, whom Lewis depicts as a natural leader who intuitively grasps the obligations the siblings have to Tumnus and to Narnia. In the film, Peter becomes a reluctant participant who is always trying to back out of Narnian affairs and get his siblings safely back to England. It's the Aragorn Complex; the only good leader, Hollywood is sure, is a reluctant leader.He goes on to say that this change, ""makes no sense, dramatically or thematically."" Well, why not? By making Peter a more reluctant hero, the screenwriter actually incorporated one of those bedrocks of good drama - internal conflict - into the characterization of Peter. This sort of change only helps to enhance the story in its translation into a two and a half hour movie. I wouldn't be so hard on Mr. Greydanus if this was his only gripe, but he goes on to produce a copious list of complaints about less-than-literal departures from the original text.This makes no sense to me. To be fair, some of the criticisms listed above do have some merit. I would liked to have heard some reference to Aslan's Father, the Emperor Across the Sea, and to the fact that it was He who wrote the laws of deep magic. Neither is there any reference to the ""deeper magic"" that overturns the deep magic, but Aslan does explain it in a way, although he doesn't use the term ""deeper magic."" But these beefs are fleas of insignifance on the back of a majestic lion. I would just as soon complain that someone freely gave me a million dollars in a paper sack when I preferred plastic. It's also true that Narnia is no Lord of the Rings. But Fruity Pebbles are also a very different animal than Peanut Butter Crunch, but I love them both. It looks like Prince Caspian is up next, so all those who appreciated this entry into the series only have good things to look forward to."	5.0	A rousing translation from book to film.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F	mdizzog	Narnia is an attempt to try to cash in on the success of the Lord of the Rings movies. If they really wanted to make a great adaptation, they should of spent more money on the CGI and makeup. You'll notice right from the start that the budget for the movie was very small in comparison to LotR. I tried to enjoy it, but it just plodded along to slowly and abruptly.It's hard trying to describe just how badly they put this movie together. The first 30 minutes of the movie consists of the kids finding the wardrobe. By the time they are actually in Narnia, you won't care because everything happens too fast. At one point they are flowing on a river of ice, and within 20 minutes of that event they are warriors and kings.That's another problem. The kids have the ability to kill minotaurs and witches without any practice. The prophecy says that 4 kids will save the land of Narnia. The way the director shoots the movie, it makes the minotaurs and centaurs look like idiots. The kids become warlords without any training, and the hardy trained soldiers can't compete with them. In LotR, the characters have trouble defeating the powers of evil. In Narnia, the kids have the ability to beat evil easily, and it ruins the movie as it just comes off as stupid and implausible in the end.The worst part of the movie though lies in the weak performances of the characters. The kids do not show organic performances. I liked Peter at the beginning of the movie. One reviewer here mentioned how Peter constantly points his sword at everything. It's true. Every time there is danger, Peter gets out his sword and points it at the enemy. He looks like an idiot when he does this. Edmund comes off as annoying and selfish. Lucy is just too happy about everything, and she gets annoying by the end. Susan isn't even used, as she contributes nothing to the movie except one point near the end.The books had a charm to them, yet the movie fails to capture any of that. I mentioned how the CGI and makeup department both did a bad job. It's easy to spot when an animal is done with CGI and when someone is dressed up to look like a centaur.	1.0	Not a good adaptation at all	2005-12-29	70	27	43

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	"I loved the books when I was young, and still read them to this very day, despite being an early 20-something now. Before I could read, my Dad read them to me, putting on silly voices, before I got fed up and learned to read, so I could make up my own voices as I went along. They were one of the first books I seriously got into, long before the Harry Potters of today. This is an instant classic. I never really understood it as a child, as I've grown older I've perhaps understood little bits here & there, but everytime I read the books now, I discover something new. Like today, I discovered I'd been reading them the 'wrong' way the whole time. I've got them in one big book, and it runs The Magician's Nephew, The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, The Horse & His Boy (the worst in my opinion) Prince Caspian, The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader The Silver Chair & The Last Battle. I always knew The Magician's Nephew was a prequel, but I've always read it first. But I didn't know The Horse & His Boy was a prequel too! The running order (as they were originally published back in the good old days) should go: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and His Boy, The Magician's Nephew & The Last Battle.I was actually nervous about watching this film beforehand. I never got to see it at the cinema - due to it being released before Christmas and I work in a card shop - so I had to wait til it was released on DVD, and then had to wait longer as it was a birthday present. And then when I'd worked myself up about watching it, I fell asleep half an hour into it. (But through tiredness, not due it being boring.)Why was I was nervous about watching it? In the late 80s, The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, Prince Caspian & The Voyage of The Dawn Treader & The Silver Chair were was actually filmed in the UK for children's TV. It was released on DVD a while ago, and it was really, REALLY bad. The young actors were nothing how I imagined them to look, the actress playing Lucy had the most awful teeth, the special effects were shockingly bad - but probably terrific for that time - and to this day, I've still never watched it all. And probably never will.Back to the review.I couldn't stay up long enough to watch all of it in one go, so carried on the following night, and found myself getting completely sucked in. It just totally came to life in my eyes, and everything was the way I remembered it. Sure, there were a couple of extra little scenes added in here & there, but only a dedicated reader would have known most of them, and they added to the film, rather than detracted. I was disappointed that some of Mr & Mrs Beaver's best lines were taken out, and Liam Neeson being the voice of Aslan just didn't work for me.The actors of Peter, Susan, Edmund & Lucy were terrific too, although I never liked Susan's character in the books, and found myself hating her in this. Thankfully, Susan & Peter never really feature that much in the books, they grow up, and get too ""old"" to believe in Narnia, so the younger ones feature much more. I wasn't keen on Tilda Swinton as The White Witch. She was very tall wasn't she? The image on screen just didn't match the image in my head. I felt myself completely sucked into the world of Narnia, and although there some slight quibbles from my Dad (having seen it) about how some things were similar to The Lord Of The Rings, and I did want to shout out ""Freedom!"" during the big battle scene, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Totally unexpected.Will I be watching this again? Most definitely. I was almost in tears, it matched what was in my head nearly perfectly. I just hope it continues throughout the rest of the films (as all books have been optioned), and doesn't go bad in some, like the Harry Potters. I don't think I can wait until 2007 for Prince Caspian. I'll definitely go to the cinema for the rest of them!!!Keep watching after the credits for a 30 second clip, featuring a little bit more of Jim Broadbent as the Professor."	4.0	There's a Mrs Macready in this!!!

This is a poor substitute for Harry Potter let alone Lord of the Rings.The earlier 1988 BBC made-for-TV version of this movie has the coldness and menace that this story deserves.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1SB93QQ54K6E6	"Melinda Burnett ""Springlering"""	"This is the story that sparks the imagination of a child, or even an adult. Many criticize it for it's Christian allegory, but many praise it for being an amazing story.The story revolves around four siblings: Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan. They moved to the country from London during the air raids of World War II. So, they go to Professor Kirke's estate, which has many artifacts and many unexplored rooms. One day while it's raining, the children play hide-and-seek and little Lucy(the youngest) hides in a wardrobe. Fortunately, she loves the feel and smell of fur, so she keeps going back, expecting to hit the backboard. Instead, she stumbles upon Narnia, a magical place that has been under the curse of the White Witch(Jadis) for over a century. Lucy meets many magical characters, including fauns, cenataurs, the great lion, Aslan, and even Father Christmas! But, there's a problem. When she goes back through War Drobe, her siblings don't believe that the place exists at all!It's up to her to convince them otherwise, to save Narnia from the White Witch's grasp, and to get Edmund to stop being a bully.Many might ask if this is good for a small child to watch. I'd say yes, because it is an emotional, but touching movie. There are a few graphic scenes: When the White Witch kills Aslan on the stone table(but he DOES come back later, so it's not completely depressing for children), a battle of good and evil, etc. etc.My Bible teacher actually had encouraged me to read the book before I saw the movie on December 9. I finished the book at approximately 2pm and was in the theaters by 6:30, watching it on the big screen. As soon as the movie ended, I walked next door to Borders, picked up a copy of all 7 books, and had finished by the next week. I've seen the movie 4 times in theaters.I doubt that I've ever seen a movie as accurate and loyal to the book as this one. There are a few minor switches, and some more drama tweaked into the plot. Director [Andrew] Adamson did an amazing job. I highly recommend reading the book before seeing it, because you have a better idea of the characters, what Edmund is going through(which I probably wouldn't have understood if I hadn't read the book), and you will be able to have a better connection to the book.I also suggest reading the Magician's Nephew, which is actually about Professor [Digory] Kirke(yes, the man who has the children at his estate)'s childhood, and how he, his best friend Polly, and The White Witch Jadis were present when Aslan sang Narnia into existence. It also explains how the wardrobe came into being and why it has magical properties. This book, however, was written after The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.It was recently confirmed that they are in fact making Prince Caspian, another book in the series. I hope that if you enjoyed this movie as much as I did, that you will, in fact, go see the second ""installment"". :)"	5.0	Narnia: An Adventure	2006-02-04	12	10	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3KEZLJ59C1JVH	Melissa Niksic	"I can't believe I waited so long to see this movie! ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is everything I hoped it would be. As a huge fan of the C.S. Lewis novel, I didn't expect the film adaptation to live up to the book, but I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie nailed everything perfectly.This film tells the story of Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. The four siblings are sent away to the home of a quirky professor during World War II. The professor's house is huge and the children spend a lot of time exploring. One day the youngest child, Lucy, stumbles across a peculiar wardrobe. Behind the mothballs and fur coats is an entrance to the magical world of Narnia, which is under the control of the evil White Witch. Lucy and her siblings encounter many colorful characters in Narnia and join with them to defeat the witch and bring freedom to the residents of Narnia.Obviously, since this is a film adaptation of a novel, a few things from the book had to be cut. The original novel is so fabulous and it's a shame that every word couldn't have been included in the movie, but that would have been virtually impossible to do. Overall, I thought the screenplay was wonderful and the film stayed very true to the book. Everything that was depicted on screen looked exactly the way I imagined it would when I read the novel. The cast is perfect...all four children are so cute! (I must admit, I was not thrilled with Georgie Henley [the actress who played Lucy] at first, but she grew on me pretty quickly...and Tilda Swinton was PERFECT as the White Witch...so creepy!) The special effects were also incredible. All of the Narnia creatures looked amazing, especially Aslan (and whoever decided to get Liam Neeson to do Aslan's voice deserves a gold star for the day).I absolutely LOVED this movie! Watching it brought back many fond memories of reading ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" as a child...I'm so glad that the book is being reintroduced to a new generation of children in such a wonderful way.

I can really see that this will be a great franchise.This movie does have a few added elements that were not in the book (as far as I remember).  However, they did not detract from the overall feel of the story.This movie may be a bit much for small children.  It really pushes the PG barrier.  There is no swearing, no sex.  However there is a tremendous violent battle (which was awesome to see), and a major character is killed.  The witch can be a little frightening, as well as some of her minions who were quite grotesque.The special effects are amazing and seamless.  Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) is stunning.  So are the varieties of animals that populate this gorgeous world.  The music is beautiful.Stick around for the credits.  They cut away almost right after they begin for a quick conversation that is helpful to know for the next movie.Lastly, if you can, view this movie in a DLP theater.  Lucas gave each state a single DLP projector for the release of Star Wars 3, and the theater near my home town happens to have the one for this state.  The technology really is worth seeing, especially in this case.  Everything is crystal clear, almost 3-d in some shots.  There are no ""hairs"" or imperfections in the film."	5.0	Great Movie!

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A9BC9ZVINYMHQ	"Meredith Burton ""Bookworm"""	"""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" is by far the best of the master storyteller, C. S. Lewis's children's books. ""The Silver Chair"" comes in second in my ranking. I was very excited to learn that a live action movie of this allegorical and entertaining classic was being released, but was frankly disappointed to learn that Disney had a hand in producing this film. Their production of ""A Wrinkle In Time"" was atrocious! However, it just goes to show that we can't always judge from past experiences. This movie stays extremely true to Lewis's novel, and even embellishes some places that add a deeper richness to the plot. For instance, the movie deals largely with the dilemma of the four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, who must be evacuated from London to the English countryside because of the German air raids. Though Lewis briefly mentions this in his novel, the film touches on the heartbreaking element of being separated from family, and suggests that this is why Edmund acts spitefully at times. The intricate plot moves from the actual historical World War II into Narnia, where the four children must engage in a battle of their own.I was extremely impressed that the symbolism was still so beautifully conveyed. Tilda Swinton as Jadis the White Witch, and Liam Neeson as Aslan both convey evil and good forces, especially Neeson, who conveys The Great Lion's authority and sacrificial love in a masterful way. Skandar Keynes is superb as Edmund, the spiteful but lonely boy who succumbs to Jadis's wiles when she feeds him Turkish Delight, (Temptation.) Georgie Henley is perfect as Lucy, conveying the little girl's innocence and wonder at stepping through a magic wardrobe, and the heartbreak of not being believed. James McAvoy is delightful as Mr. Tumnus the Faun who has a heart of gold and is also very funny. William Moseley is magnificent as Peter, showing his self-doubt and ultimate bravery. Anna Popplewell is excellent as Susan, a girl with doubts like her older brother, and the voice of reason. Dawn French and Ray Winstone are excellent as the Beavers, and provide lots of commic relief and valuable insight. A side mention must be made for Rupert Everet who plays a fox. Although it is a small role, he steals the sceens in which he plays. All of the supporting cast are equally excellent, and they work to bring Lewis's thrilling classic brilliantly to life.I actually went to the theater and watched the film three times, and everyone who accompanied me commented on the beauty of the scenery. I am blind myself, so I cannot comment on this aspect, but I will say that the musical score of the movie is breathtakingly beautiful. As an example, listen closely when the small, seemingly insignificant army of Aslan, led by Peter, comes out to meet the vast army of the White Witch. The music in this portion truly conveys the bravery of good coming up against insurmountable opposition and evil. I was moved to tears, as I am sure you will be. Also, please listen and see how much symbolism you can spot. Of course, if this is your first time getting acquainted with Narnia, just enjoy the rich imagery and breathtaking story, and please read the book. The director and producers worked diligently, and crafted an unforgettable masterpiece. You will cry, laugh, and never be the same again.

Four children living in WW II London are sent to live in the countryside by their mother to protect them from the frequent air raids.  They end up in a mansion on a huge estate.  The mansion has one room with nothing in it but an armoir.  The children use it to hide and are accidently transported to a fantasy world with talking animals and a witch that wants them dead.  They are forced to grow up fast if they hope to survive.The special effects are great and the witch is the most memorable since Margaret Hamiliton's Wicked Witch of the West!

The fourth disc is the best as it takes the ""audio commentary"" a step further by showing the theatrical cut of the film alongside clips of the shooting of the film, effects work, wardrobe, comments and more.

The four children are well played by Georgie Henley (the cutest little tyke since Drew Barrymore in ET); Skandor Keynes as the dark and brooding Edmond; William Moseley (looking like a cross between Richard Thomas and a young Heath Ledger) is the gallant older brother destined to be king; Anna Popplewell is the reserved, upstanding older sister; Tilda Swinton is awesome as the witch, conveying a chilling evil not recently seen; and James McEvoy is delightful as the faun, Mr. Thommus.  Under Andrew Adamson's (SHREK) sure direction, the movie is a marvelous fantasy indeed.  Even though it is somewhat violent, there is no lingering gore, so kids should be allright with it.	5.0	WONDERFUL FANTASY FILM	2006-04-05	2	1	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2BON03VAFS1SZ	Michael Fishman	As a lifelong fan of fantasy/sci-fi I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. It was fun seeing a fantasy world like Narnia brought to life so realistically on screen (assuming the obviously fake snow and cold don't count!).I haven't read the Narnia books so I don't know if the movie was faithful to them or not, but I thought what they brought to the screen was pretty good and very entertaining. I had read comments about the movie shortly after its release about it having a religious agenda, and while there were some religious allegories in the movie, I personally didn't see that agenda. Yes, there was one scene involving the Lion and the Witch in particular, but that was about all I noticed and to be truthful, it didn't bother me.I have two complaints about the movie: I would have liked a little back story and there was a little too much with the talking animals in the movie. I like talking animals alright, but too much is still too much and after 2+ hours it was starting to get to be too much.A fun movie, good special effects (and I'm not generally a fan of movies filmed almost completely in front of a green screen), but not a lot of Narnia history, back story or substance. I enjoyed the movie, but it won't be taking the place of The Wizard of Oz, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings or the old animated movie Wizards on my list anytime soon.	4.0	Fun fantasy for fans	2011-02-16	0	0	0

Tresca ""Talien"""	"I think I may have read The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe at some point, but it's all fuzzy.  Mostly, I remember the effeminate lion, known as Aslan, from the animated version.  This left an impression on viewers for sure, because it showed up in a South Park episode (apparently, all lions do is tell really dumb jokes). This movie will make you forget the animated version of the C.S. Lewis' novel.To wit, the children of the Pevensie family are sent away to live with foster parents during World War II. There's brave Peter (William Moseley), angry Edmund (Shandar), smart Susan (Anna Popplewell) and innocent Lucy (Georgie Henley).  The four are eventually transported to Narnia, a land populated by fauns, centaurs, werewolves, minotaurs, ogres, giants, harpies, phoenixes, griffons, goblins, and talking animals.  It is here that the Christ-like lion known as Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) has returned to do battle with the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).The four children are each gifted with special weapons by none other than Santa Claus--err, sorry, Father Christmas (James Cosmo)--and ultimately must face their own fears and share their unique talents to save Narnia.The film starts out slow, slow enough to make the children in the audience restless.  But once the war begins, it's a heart-pounding race to the finish.  Never before have so many mythological beings blasted across the screen, Dungeons & Dragons style, to beat the stuffing out of each other. The special effects are so good that when Aslan isn't speaking you forget he's an animated lion.  And amazingly, this is a PG (not even PG-13!) movie.People get hurt and even die.  Big, scary monsters try to murder each other as well as the children.  And they use words like ""kill.""  This is not the kiddy fare you remember.And yet, not one child was upset.  Narnia harkens back to a time when fairytales were cautionary stories that demonstrated the right choices through the travails of its protagonists.  All four children grow: Peter finds his courage, Edmund his humility, Susan her sense of wonder, and Lucy...well, Lucy discovers loss.The Christian symbolism is rife but appropriate.  Ironically, Narnia may well convert those holdouts that feel fantasy is somehow evil, as opposed to its original roots--allegories for Christian morality.  It completes the work that Peter Jackson started, a sort of Lord of the Rings for the kiddie set.  I for one am glad that C.S. Lewis' vision was realized with such breathtaking imagination.All that, and there's not a trace of a lisping lion."	4.0	No Lisping Lion Here!	2005-12-20	4	2	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3D9KO6R1JB845	Michael Sloane,Tempe,Arizona,United States of...	"The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe is a quality movie that is a worthy addition to the fantasy genre. The key to enjoying this film,though,is to NOT compare it to other fantasy films. No,it's not as good as Harry Potter or even Lord of the Rings. But in and of itself is highly satisfying film. Don't compare it to other movies. Enjoy it for what it is. With a few changes,this movie is pretty faithful to the book. Now,from a visual point of view,this movie gets the job done. The wardrobe itself is fantastic and the snowy Narnia Lucy enters as well as the battlefield at the end are well captured. The animals,especailly the beavers and Aslan look pretty realistic.  The storyline flows along pretty nicely. It is somewhat slow at the start,but never to point of dragging and once they are in Narnia the story flows on wonderfully.  And I liked Georgie's performance a lot. She NAILED Lucy. The Journey into Narnia,the epic battle,and the coronation follow the book pretty well. 1 change I didn't like was when they edited out the ""Deeper Magic From Before the Dawn Of Time."" and replaced it with a ""different interpretation "" of the ""Deep Magic."" This makes it sound as though the ""Deep Magic."" played a role in the rise of Aslan,when in the book,it was clearly the ""Deeper Magic."" that allowed him to rise. That's the 1 change I felt was untrue to the spirit of the book. On the other hand I liked the way the started the movie. In the book there's just a small line saying the children had been sent away during the war. I like the way they made the filmmakers actually SHOWED this as opposed to just telling it. By actually showing this scene,the filmmakers captured the emotional state of the children in a way the book didn't. You really understand by the time the children are at Professor Kirke's house that they are not on vacation,but are really going through some very tough times. All in all,the journey of the characters (Edmund,peter,Susan,Lucy,Aslan,Etc.) is well captured by the film.  All in all,the Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe is pretty faithful to the book and is a quality movie."	4.0	Very Faithful to C.S. Lewis masterpiece.	2013-05-26	0	0	0

We had just finished an Advent study using the book.  The kids were absolutely fascinated as were the  adults.  We had viewed a video from BBC and this film surpassed by far the video.  I highly recommend this film for family viewing. After seeing other reviews that totally panned this film, I wonder where if they have a sense of fantasy.  I did not read the series until I was an adult and could not put them down until finished.  I don't know what others were looking for, but I wanted to visualize what I had read.  This film did just that and more.  I came away from the film comparing it with ""The Passion of The Christ.""  Check the parallels and see if you don't feel the same.  Not as much violence, but the story string is there if you look for it. I went to be entertained, not to challenge the acting and technology.  I was entertained to the utmost.  Give this movie a chance to challenge your theology.Look beyond the flaws (and every movie based on literature is flawed) and feel what Lewis is saying to all of us in a world of tumult and turmoil. Great Britain had just come thru horrendous times and was on its knees when Lewis wrote this story.  I believe he was attempting to show that no matter how bad things are there is always somthing better just around the corner, across the street or, even, tomorow.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	ALGEIGEM7QKQG	Michael Walter	"The ""Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe(CON),"" represents a great depiction of Christ and represents Christianity in a lot of ways, but through that we saw much more than a dream world, we saw the depiction of Christ at work through the storyline, and Aslan as the King and Savior. This movie has a lot of positives and not to many negatives in it. Even though it might seem that this movie looks to grab the attention of younger people, the overall themes look toward Christ and have many people seeing it as a life-changing. Were going to look at the positives in Narnia and how Christianity is themed throughout the whole movie.Throughout the ""CON"" we see how the importance of life is key to wining the race. Lucy, Edmond, Peter and Susan find themselves lost in a Wardrobe and walk into a fairytale land that they have never seen before. The kids think the world of Narnia is great but they soon find out there is evil in this land also. The fight between good and evil cause almost be depicted as the forces of ""Heaven"" and ""Hell."" Aslan is the leader of the good people of Narnia and the White Witch is the self proclaimed queen of Narnia. Here the movie sheds light on the basis of Christianity and how Christians have to face the death and destruction of the world. With Edmond's life on the line, Aslan had to sacrifice his life for him. At the night of the sacrifice it is almost like the day that Christ was crucified. All of the similarities are seen throughout that night even to the point of death and resurrection. The storyline itself gives way to so many parallels to Christianity.The character of Aslan can be perceived as much more that a King. Aslan is a lion who can be seen as the king over everyone. All the animals looked up to Aslan as Lord over Narnia and is definitely the depiction of Christ. Without the leadership from Aslan, the land of Narnia would surely fall to the hands of the White Witch. Alsan's character is so important because he was there in Narnia to preserve the good in that world. In the same way Christ was put on Earth for a purpose to seek and to save what was lost. Also in the ""CON"" it does a good job of giving Aslan a Character that is very personal and caring to each individual he see's. Christ is also the same way and it gives a very positive outlook on Christianity and how Jesus is also there for everyone's needs.Finally is the way Aslan is seen as the savior in the movie. When Edmond s life on the line, Aslan gladly stepped in front and was willing to put his life on the line for him. With Christianity, its the same thing that Christ did for us on the Cross. He saved us from the sins of the world and helped to give us a way to eternal life by getting to know him. Also after Aslan was killed, a couple days later he resurrected in front of the eyes of Lucy and Susan. The same way, Christ also resurrected and too a girl saw the Lord a couple days after his resurrection (Mary Magdelene). With the war scene too, Aslan comes back to save his fellow friends, and in the same way Christ is going to come back to save us from the sins of the world.As seen throughout the movie the ""CON"" there are a lot of parallels to Christianity. The characters in the movie help to bring alive the real life connections for us today. Christ can be seen as a leader the same way that Aslan is for the land of Narnia. Also Aslan was the ultimate sacrifice for Narnia but in the same way, Christ paid a much bigger price. In movies we try to compare things to Christ and what he did, but what he did on the cross is so much bigger than what we can fathom. With the help of the ""CON"" movies though, maybe we can shed a little light on the reality of Christ here on Earth. Maybe in the future, people will see what it really means to become a Christian."	5.0	Christianity in Narnia	2010-09-23	3	2	1

One day, while playing hide and seek, Lucy hides in a wardrobe.  She soon finds it is no ordinary wardrobe as it transports her to Narnia, a magical wintery world.  She meets Mr. Rumnus (McAvoy), and finds out that it has been winter there for 100 years because of the rule of the Wite Witch (Swinton).After returning to her world, she brings her siblings back with her.  Edmund disappears, having been tricked by the White Witch, and the rest must rescue him and save Narnia in the process.On the heels of ""The Lord of the Rings"", it is no surprise that this movie has been made.  There has been a surge in the popularity of fantasy epics as of late, and ""Narnia"" is a logical coice for the film treatment.  The results are about the same as the ""Rings"" trilogy.  The acting is solid all around.  This is impressive since the film is carried by four kids with minimal acting experience.  Swinton is menacing as the evil White Witch, and probably the standout performance of the movie.  The special effects are good overall.  Aslan the lion is impressive, and looks completely real.  Some of the scenes look like they were definately filmed in front of a green screen though, and that is distracting.  The story is given a good treatment by ""Shrek"" director Andrew Adamson, but I was not blown away like I hoped to be.

This movie was, in general, well done and entertaining.Georgie Henley, Lucy, was AMAZING and I can't wait to see her in future films.  I also enjoyed how the witch was portrayed, being subtley evil.  I loved the casting for Aslan as well; Liam Neeson's voice carries a quiet strength that was crucial to Aslan's character.What was missing ... first of all, Peter and Susan were not even close to what I pictured in the novel.  Peter was supposed to be honorable and brave, not cowardly.  He is self-pitying through the movie instead of being the stronghold of the children.  He also is just mean to Edward ... in the book he does put Edward in his place, but not spitefully as he does here.Second, I thought Susan was dreadfully over the top.  I didn't like the choice in actress or character portrayall at all.  Susan here was completely annoying and nagging for the sake of being smart & practical (which Peter points out in this movie, but that's never in the book).  When I read the book, she seemed down-to-earth and realistic, and more loving than annoying.  Her motives are completely lost in the movie.  I even loved the way she was portrayed in the cartoon much better.Those are my biggest complaints, besides the fact that they could have done a lot more to make the magic of Narnia come to life with all the cinematic tools available.I have to say that I did love the way the director shot his scenes throughout the movie; it really gave a unique perspective, almost comic-book-like.Overall, I am a huge fan of this epic, so I will buy this collector's edition.  AFter all, over the years I have acquired every other version out there.  However, this movie is NOT my favorite.  I'll definitely pop in the cartoon first.  I might even choose the BBC edition with the annoying Lucy and poor acting over this one.  At least most of the characters were true to the book.	2.0	Didn't live up to my expectations	2006-04-10	11	4	7
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	The release of two centrically Christian theological films, Mel Gibson's controversial The Passion of the Christ and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, could not have come at more crucial junctures in modern American history. The thirty-million dollar budgeted The Passion of the Christ, which then went on to gross more then three-hundred and seventy-million dollars in North America alone by the end of its run in theatres, played brilliantly off of Michael Moore's seething anti-Bush propagandist piece Fahrenheit 9/11 and by November of that year proved to be momentous in the president's reelection victory, although it was far from the true issue which garnered him the majority of the people's vote (that being his stance toward the war against terrorism). The release of the second of six books in the Chronicles of Narnia series comes at a time when American Christians, many of whom side with in some shape or another with the Republican Party, find themselves in pitched battle against the intimations of political correctness and multiculturalism in their retention of the significance and sanctity of Christmas itself. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe will likely play a less indicative role then The Passion of the Christ did toward the political environment of the country last year and yet its direct allusions to Christ and his message will almost certainly be a factor in the way Christians are motivated maintain their traditions and be less reluctant to give them up for anyone.The story for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe remains true to both C.S. Lewis's epic vision of the whimsical world of Narnia and all those who inhabit it and the Christian undertones which encompass the plot and character developments of the entire book series. This said however, the feature film adaptation of the classic children's novel does take its fair share of creative liberties in regards to specific plot elements which, for lack of a better word, fail to translate as effectively onto the screen as Lewis may have hoped they would. Rather then tarnishing C.S. Lewis's epic, they instead enhance the emotional intensity of the plot. For example, there is a scene not presented in the book in which the White Witch's secret police (wolves) are in hot pursuit of Peter, Susan, and Lucy as they cross the thawing river. This accentuates the potency of the situation and makes for a far more engaging experience then any minimal description penned in the novel could have. Furthermore, scenes like the opening sequence of the film in which German (Nazi) planes are seen bombing the city of London, an event now referred to as The Battle of Britain, fills in the gaps of background information left absent by Lewis. And while Adamson falls short of addressing the specifics of either the Nazis who bombed Britain or the Second World War in general, he leaves just enough room to allow parents at their own discretion to discuss these events in more detail with their own children as they see fit.All four child actors in the roles of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie do a splendid job in their respected roles. There are however some issues with their characters. Peter's transformation from a gangling British preteen into a cunning and formidable warrior and inspirational leader of Aslan's army is one point of contention. It comes off as a bit miraculous, if not a bit implausible, and may be difficult for some people to swallow. Nevertheless, this is a fantasy film after all and it can just as easily be contributed to magic.James McAvoy is positively magnificent in the role of Mr. Tumnus, the faun, or half-man/half-goat, who is the first creature in the world of Narnia to befriend the young Lucy when she initially enters the magical wardrobe. His interaction with Lucy, played adorably by newcomer Georgie Henley, is emotionally priceless and works every bit as well as one might have imagined reading the children's novel. The character himself is representative of two crucial concepts author C.S. Lewis introduces in the novel. While the faun is a creature often associated with Greek/Roman paganism, he is not necessarily an evil character. Although he does stray from the righteous path in the beginning, he quickly comes to see the error of his ways and repents. Lewis' point here is that while Christianity is preferred above all other religions, every religion strives toward the virtues of charity and compassion. So when you boil down to the basics of religion, there is a common element that every one of us can relate to. The second point Lewis makes with the introduction of Mr. Tumnus is that while Christians are susceptible to sin and may initially fall prey to it, whether it be out of fear or necessity, we still have the choice to realize we are in the wrong and make up for our mistakes as Mr. Tumnus does.Tilda Swinton is emphatically conniving as the white witch Jadis, an evil enchantress who rules the realm of Narnia with a cold iron fist, turning anyone who crosses her path into stone and stowing away the hope of all its inhabitants with continuous winter without Christmas. Jadis signifies the figurative temptation of sin and evil in the world. While on the outside she may emit a certain ambiance about her that makes her attractive and desirable, once Edward gives in to the white witch's desire to capture Peter, Susan, and Lucy, he comes to grips with her true nature which is malevolent to the core. And while some readers are quick to associate Jadis with Satan, supreme rule of Hell, most literary scholars agree that she may very well be a servant of Lucifer but not the actual Prince of Darkness himself since there is no direct correlation between her actions and those of Satan as opposed to the equivalence between Aslan and Jesus Christ. Her demise, however, is not as dramatic as it should have been and feels a bit rushed as soon as the resurrected Aslan arrives on the battle scene.Overall, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is every bit as magnificent as readers dreamed it would be and exceeds nearly every expectation, though certainly far from all of them, writer C.S. Lewis may have set down for its adaptation in the last fifty years since audiences first discovered the world of Narnia. Parents however should seek to take certain precautions with their younger children as there particular scenes in the film, specifically the sacrifice of Aslan on the Stone Table, which are emotionally profound and may be too stimulating for smaller audiences. Nevertheless, if children of a specific age demographic are able to sit through the latest Harry Potter picture with little if any difficulties at all then they should be fine toward this film. The musical score, conducted by Academy Award-winning composer Harry Gregson-Williams, famous for compositions for Shrek and Team America: World Police, is not nearly as memorable as those for The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter franchises, lacking anything related to a reoccurring musical theme, but at the same time it reaches the right emotional depth, particularly in the Battle for Narnia, while not overshadowing the actions or dialogue onscreen. Director Andrew Adamson and, more importantly, the new leadership of the Walt Disney Corporation who have in the past been far from what one would consider a close friend to the Christian community should be commended for not downplaying the allusions to Christian theology, particularly Aslan as a mirror-image of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, in an age where political correctness has dominated modern society. There is still much debate amongst the literary community as to whether the Christian allegories in The Chronicles of Narnia series were intentional or not on the part of adult Christian convert C.S. Lewis. Regardless of the true answer, if one does indeed exist, anyone unfamiliar with the suggested theological prospects of the story will hardly notice and their perception of the film so go unchanged. Though comparisons are likely to made to The Lord of the Rings series or even the Harry Potter franchise, nonetheless the special effects of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe hold their own as dazzling and the physical environment which encompasses the characters of the film, all shot on the island of New Zealand where Peter Jackson's King Kong and the three Lord of the Rings films were also filmed, is nothing short of breathtaking. Notwithstanding allegations from the ACLU quick to label The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as a piece of unmitigated brainwashing propaganda from the religious right who seek to convert the `pagans' to Christianity, the film remains a timeless fantasy classic and an emotionally grappling motion picture event, theological allusions or not.	4.0	The Moose Hole - Passion of the 'Lion'	2005-12-21	4	0	4
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AUSATFDSU2INS	"milss ""Yellow hair warrior"""	Is there anything more exciting for a bored child than to discover a portal that opens into a magical world of fairies and fauns, where a majestic lion battles a bad witch? That's the premise of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Walt Disney Picture's version of the first book in Lewis' seven-volume, allusion-rich, and allegorical exploration of Christian theology.During the London Blitz, four English children (The Pevensie children, ages 12 to 17) are evacuated to the country, into the care of an eccentric old professor. Soon, the children stumble upon a wardrobe in an unused room. Like Alice in Wonderland, the wardrobe is the portal to another world. Once they cross the threshold, they go into a magical world.As the Pevensie kids enter Narnia, they have to face some unexpected truths. Jadis the bad-tempered, cold-hearted evil White Queen (Tilda Swinton), holds all of Narnia in her frozen grip. Their sudden, but expected arrival triggers a call to war. And the lion king messiah Aslan returns to lead the way. Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keenness), older brother Peter (William Moseley), sister Susan (Anna Popplewell), and, the youngest, Lucy (Georgie Henley), will have to face great challenges as they fight alongside Aslan to return Narnia to the glorious kingdom it used to be.As fantasy films go, Narnia tells a relatively easy-to-follow story, clearly designed for a younger audience than The Lord of the Rings. The typical core family values theme of the Disney movies mixes its brand of Christian family values with popular English sentiment.Despite comparisons to The Lord of the Rings, Narnia has more in common with both The Wizard of Oz and Peter Pan, since all three stories involve children who escape day-to-day pessimism to experience wild adventures.High-tech special effects enable the filmmakers to breath life into exotic and beautiful creatures of myth and fantasy. Fauns with the legs of goats, half-human and half-horse centaurs, and a magnificent lion that talks and leads an army of gnomes, fairies, beavers, hawks, and foxes are some of the visual marvels this movie offers us.Director Andrew Adamson (Shrek) makes an impressive live-action debut, getting engrossing performances from his young cast and grafting a nice world of special effects, giving The Chronicles of Narnia an impressive start as another family classic of myth and fable on the big screen.	4.0	Inside the most magical wardrobe	2006-01-18	2	1	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2U1BL88JRGVXH	"Minal Patel ""Bookworm"""	It has been years since I have read the book.  The movie was nothing like I expected. I loved MR Tumnus and The Beavers. I also liked the Centaurs, and the Witches assistant (surprised to find that he was born in the same country as me and is also the same ethnicity as me). I also liked Maugrim.  I think the Professor and the Housekeeper were played well as was the Witch. THe children were also good but somehow seemed a little out of place in their environment. Something felt not quite right, I dont know maybe this is because I imagined the story as a cartoon or because older movies and series tend to have children talking in slightly higher voices than they do in contemporary movies, it didn't seem to fit.  It also seemed a little unrealistic that a 13 year old (I think thats how old Peter was) could wield a sword, or out of place, and that a 6 year old could be a healer. The books are written during a time when I think children would not have had such responsibilities.  I dont know maybe I just remember Peter and lucy as being older.  If Narnia is imagination then it works, if not then not so sure.  The christian element is off putting.	3.0	not bad,	2007-02-03	10	0	10
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" was adapted from the first book in C.S. Lewis' ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" children's fantasy series, which has found popularity with readers of all ages since its publication in 1950. I found the book too simplistic as a child, but the movie is more effective. Visual effects have finally achieved enough sophistication to allow a live action film adaptation. Real people and real animals lend the story a credibility and power that previous animated versions lacked. Director Andrew Adamson has created a film that truly is entertaining for all ages, even where the book came up short. It might be dangerous to say so in some circles, but this film is superior to the book  -with vastly improved dialogue, 3-dimensional character writing, better pacing, and production design that surpasses C. S. Lewis' imagination.During World War II, the Pevensie children -teenaged Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell), younger Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and youngest Lucy (Georgie Henley)- are sent from London to the relative safety of an old Professor's (Jim Broadbent) county home. While playing hide-and-seek one day, Lucy tries hiding in a large wardrobe which, to her astonishment, leads to a wonderful wintry world called Narnia. No one believes Lucy, of course, until her brothers and sister also squeeze into the wardrobe and are transported to Narnia, where they find that they are expected to defeat the tyrannical White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and restore peace to the land in accordance with the prophecy: ""When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone sits at Cair Paravel in throne, the evil time will be over and done.""A fantastic cast leads the audience through Narnia: The young actors who play the children are all spot-on in their roles, but special credit may be due the youngest of the cast, Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes. Georgie Henley is a real scene-stealer, and she personifies a child's great capacity  for curiosity, sympathy, and openness. Skandar Keynes has the most complex and conflicted role as Edmund, who is willful and resentful of his older brother. Tilda Swinton is perfection as the White Witch. The animals of Narnia are a combination of real animals and computer generated ones, which makes for mixed results. Real wolves make the chase scenes fabulously suspenseful, while the CG Mr. and Mrs. Beaver don't look remotely real, so it's a good thing they are comic characters. The lion Aslan skirts the line between realistic appearance and animated, but the dramatic scene of his death is so affecting that the audience won't doubt him.This film turns to Biblical allegory later in the story than the book does, but when it does, it's unmistakable. Don't let that put you off if you're not Christian. The Gospels are as good as source of inspiration as any other historical or mythological source, and C. S. Lewis draws on Greek and Norse mythology as well. In fact, Lewis vehemently denied that the book is allegory, although that seems to be an argument over semantics more than substance. ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is a cinematic spectacle replete with strange creatures, talking animals, great battles, stunning production design, drama, and adventure, grounded for the audience by the emotions and choices of 4 very human youngsters.The DVD (Disney 2006 single disc): Bonus features on the single disc edition are ""The Bloopers of Narnia"" (5 min), ""Discover Narnia Fun Facts"", which are pop-up facts about Narnia by C.S. Lewis' stepson Douglas Gresham that can be enabled to play during the movie, and 2 audio commentaries. The first audio commentary is by director Andrew Adamson and the actors who played the children: William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley. Adamson leads the commentary and contributes some technical details, while the actors recall filming each scene, including some amusing on-set anecdotes. The second audio commentary is by director Andrew Adamson, production designer Roger Ford (by phone from Australia), and producer Mark Johnson. Adamson contributes some more technical details, information about locations, comments on adapting the book, and a little bit about visual effects. Roger Ford has interesting things to say about set and prop design. Captioning for the film is available in English. Subtitles and dubbing are available in French and Spanish."	4.0	Enchanting Cast Anchors This Stunning Adaptation of C. S. Lewis' Book.	2006-04-15	1	1	0

Though I was never much of a fan of the book it was based on (I prefer the others in the series, particularly Magician's Nephew and Voyage of the Dawn Treader) it was a really good movie. Through some force outside of my control I ended up seeing it three times in theaters, and it did not decrease in enjoyment at all. To the contrary, it got better.Before I go into details I want to say one thing: James MacAvoy truly outdoes himself as Mr. Tumnus, and he so transformed that character from just another guy to my favorite person in the movie that I had to mention him.I won't go into the plot, since most everyone is familiar with it. The landscapes were breathtakingly pretty, even the pastoral English countryside in the ""real"" world. The acting was great for the most part (except for Peter. I was wincing through every one of that kid's lines) and even Georgie Henley, a very young actress, was excellent as Lucy.Yes, there were some scenes not in the book, and the stab-sword-in-ice thing was strange, but for the most part this didn't have any real flaws. Liam Neeson was probably the best choice for Aslan, as his voice evokes wisdom but gets straight to the point. All the children were good (except for Peter, but I've mentioned that already.) When it meant to be emotional, it was emotional. And when it meant to be breathtaking, it was.One of the best cinematic parts was when the camera focused on the map of the battlefield and then flew down into it. Who didn't feel their heart soar right then? The cinematography was very well done.I don't have anything but praise for this movie, really. It was a great experience, worthy of several re-watchings, and I can't wait for Prince Caspian and the others.Rating: Very Good"	5.0	Excellent movie	2007-07-12	1	1	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A32J48LYJ2BNNY	Monty Rainey	I was truly hoping that C. S. Lewis would receive the same degree of fanfare, professionalism and attention to detail for his magnificent work, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, that his friend Tolkien received of his. Sadly, such was not the case. Lewis's work received but a fraction of the fanfare of the Rings Trilogy, the casting was unheard of, and the production itself was the biggest disappointment of all.I didn't get the opportunity to view this on the big screen and it may have looked better there, but the DVD version is so dark that roughly one third of the movie is unviewable on a TV screen. The special effects were no where near the quality I was hoping for and aside from the voice of Liam Neeson, the cast was virtually unknown.Children will like the movie, as it seems to have been produced with the Disney flavor of being geared more towards children than the Rings Trilogy was. The battle scenes are not nearly as violent. Perhaps the one saving grace for this one is that it might influence some of the more enlightened and ambitious youngsters to explore the written works of Lewis, as the book is always far more compelling than anything Hollywood can produce. Lewis was certainly one of the master storytellers of the last century and his work deserved better.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3T0OTH5072YRE	"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming"""	"The Chronicles of Narnia has been a long standing favorite book series of mine.  So of course I was excited when they decided to do a movie adaptation.  I had a little trepidation as movies are not usually as good as the books, but this one surprised me very much.  It really did justice to the book, and even the scenes that weren't in the book still fit very well into the story.Four children are evacuated to the countryside during World War II.  While there, Lucy, the youngest, stumbles upon a wardrobe that leads her into a different world.  A world named Narnia.  The rest of the children come with her later and learn that they are part of a prophecy.  They will help overthrow the White Witch who has made Narnia into a winter wonderland for the past one hundred years.  With the help of Aslan, the great lion, they will fight the white witch for the hope of Narnia.Characters:William Moseley: Peter PevensieAnna Popplewell: Susan PevensieSkandar Keynes: Edmund PevensieGeorgie Henley: Lucy PevensieTilda Swinton: JadisLiam Neeson: AslanJames McAvoy: Mr. TumnusRay Winstone: Mr. BeaverDawn French: Mrs: BeaverKiran Shah: GinarrbrikJim Broadbent: Professor Digory KirkeElizabeth Hawthorne: Mrs. MacreadyJames Cosmo: Father ChristmasI think that all of the characters were well cast in this movie.  I especially liked Georgie as Lucy Pevensie.  She had the right touch of innocence and bravery and really pulled off the part well.  But then again the rest are pretty good too.  Edmund is such a brat at the beginning that I really disliked him.  Mr. Tumnus was just plain cute and sweet and the beavers were also pretty great as well.  The only character I didn't really like was Jadis and that was just because she was more weird than creepy.  But maybe that was the effect they were going for since it was Disney.This movie didn't stray from the book too far.  There were a couple of scenes that weren't in the book, but as said before, I thought they really fit in with the story well.  The special effects were also extremely good.  I had always wondered how they would handle a centaur and a unicorn and they both came out looking extremely realistic. I didn't think the dryads were as good.  I just envisioned a different interpretation for them.  The music is by far one of the best features of the film.  It was just so hauntingly pretty and invoked a ""Narnian"" sense of wonder through the film.  I especially liked the song that played during the initial train ride.  I don't know its name, but it was beautiful.Great movie adaptation of a great book.  I find it hard to be in any way disappointed with this movie.Review by M.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2UD8A6JDZ8L4M	"Mr. Mike ""Sci Fi Guy"""	"I did not read the books so this film was my first introduction to the whole Narnia saga.  Overall, I enjoyed this film.  Probably not as much as my kids, but I still did.  To sum it up I would call it a Lord of the Rings LO-CALORIE version.  This film was not nearly as deep as LOTR nor did it have the breadth of characters.  It did have some cool fantasy characters though and there were parts of the movie that I thought were really cool.  Here is a ""good"" and ""bad"" breakdown for you:GOOD:- Special effects were excellent overall except for just a few scenes.  The world of Narnia seemed like a mystical place that would be really cool to visit.- The actress that played Lucy did a fine job with her character.- The Witch was also very well played and she was scary, sexy, ugly, and sinister at the same time.... very nice!- I liked Liam Neeson's voice for Aslen, it seemed to fit well and the animation was superb for the mighty Lion....it seemed like he was really there.- Some of the other characters were also very well done.  I'm not a huge CGI fan by any means and I do feel that most movies overdo it, but the characters in this movie were well done and convincing.BAD:- It took the kids a while to finally get on their journey and into Narnia.  I think they could have used some of this time to build character relationships instead.- The kids could have been a little more ""awed"" or ""wowed"" by their new environment.  They were too comfortable and adapted to their new surroundings and should have been more shocked and surprised.  It was like they had seen this kind of thing before.- Peter was not a very cool character.... he was somewhat wimpy and this didnt match the kind of person that Aslen would have chosen to lead an army to fight the Witch.- The film was a little tame and had that ""don't be too scary"" Disney touch.  I suppose they had to do this though as to not scare little kids.  It did make the film a little softer than adults would have liked though.- I would have preferred a deeper storyline and a little more build-up.  Once things got rolling, it all happened pretty quickly and perhaps some more in-depth story could have been told.Overall, as I said, I liked this film and recommend watching it.  As for owning it, not sure about that.  It may depend on the other films in the series and whether or not they are worth having.  If the other films are solid, then I would add it to the ""saga"".  The jury is still out as of right now though."	3.0	"Solid entertainment, a little ""happy"" compared to other films of the same genre..."	2006-04-13	3	0	3

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2H22I2RWE0HOV	Mr. Sinister	The Lion, The With, And The Wardrobe has been a staple of childrens' literature for decades.  Much like The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings.  In fact, Rings author Tolkein and Lewis were friends.  Hmmm.  Drawing parallels.  Peter Jackson took The Lord Of The Rings and awed us and in effect raised the bar for anyone doing a classic series in the future.  Enter The Chronicles of Narnia.  Big budget.  Unknown star.  Walt Disney backing.  What could possibly go wrong.  The answer is nothing.  The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is visually stunning.  Its epic.  It's envisions Lewis' tale to the fullest extent.  Sure, there are some minor violations of story as prescribed by the novel, and I sure that's going to freak out the purists and C.S. Lewis diehards, but...who cares.  I was always into Tolkein way, way more than the Narnia books.  If the film has any drawbacks it's that, having read the book, it's so exact as to be a bit boring in parts.  You already know what's going to happen.  The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe was always the most popular of the Narnia saga and it will be interesting to see what they make of the other, lesser-read, lesser-known Narnia books.  Overall...your kids will love this movie because it has everything.  Aldults who read the book may find it sort of tedious in places.  Otherwise, great effort and pure family entertainment.Dig it!	5.0	Jacksonesque Visions Of C.S. Lewis - Entertainment Supreme	2006-04-05	5	4	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2T02KBUTKW8VG	MtGiraffe	"In anticipation of the film, I finally read ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" for the first time.  It is a wonderfully imaginative and compelling story, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the new film is very faithful to its source.  I think longtime fans of the ""Narnia"" book series will appreciate the film's respect for C.S. Lewis's writings, and even those not familiar with the series should enjoy the exciting film.The film's special effects (of which there are many) are some of the best of 2005, making the talking animals and mythical creatures in Narnia completely convincing (instead of distracting).  However, I was the most surprised by how good the film's acting was.  Tilda Swinton is deliciously evil as the White Witch, but the real surprise came from the acting abilities of the four central children, who really seem like siblings onscreen.  Especially noteworthy is Georgie Henley, who plays Lucy, the youngest of the siblings.  Henley's performance is wonderful throughout the film, winning over the audience without ever becoming cutesy.  It's a shame the three main ""Harry Potter"" kids were not this strong in the first of their films (though they have improved with each installment).I definitely recommend seeing ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,"" and I hope they make more ""Narnia"" films soon.  If this first film is any indication, the series could be a worthy successor to the now-completed ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy."	5.0	I'm Glad I've Been Sucked into the Narnia Universe	2006-05-09	3	3	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1UIRLE9SHFF77	"Narnia Fan ""Mom"""	I have read several of the reviews on this movie, and have to say that I think those giving this movie only two stars and calling it boring or comparing it to Lord of the Rings are missing the point entirely.  I have a five year old and a seven year old, and as much as I love Lord of the Rings, I would never ever consider letting THEM watch it! Narnia is a CHILDREN'S movie.  My children thouroughly enjoyed it, and so did I.  I watched it with an open mind and kept in mind the context in which it was offered, and the audience it was targeting.  I was glad that I could share it with my children.  They were wide eyed and so impressed with how real all the characters looked.  They have watched it again and again.  I think it is charming, and I am very very glad there was not a bloody battle scene, or I would not have been able to let my children watch it!  If you didn't grasp the concept that this was a family movie, then you have no one to blame for your disappointment but yourself. Next time you go to watch a Disney film, remember who Disney is making the film for.  If you are expecting to see a movie that has realistic battle scenes, intense action and academy award winning performances, stick to the R rated movies, and leave the PG rated ones to the families!	5.0	This is a Children's Movie!	2006-04-18	6	5	1

While the film version will entertain a younger audience and simultaneously teach positive values, isn't it better for the children to be reading the book anyway?  From an execution standpoint the film was flimsy and transparent.  The kids acted their hearts out, but sometimes heart doesn't make up for lack of refinery.  The visual effects were stunning, yet typical.  The filmmakers were obviously trying to ride in on the winds of the Lord of the Rings blockbuster, and were able to post good numbers at the box office by doing so, but the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe will not perevere through time.  All in all, you probably should see it if you need to keep up with the other soccer moms in gossip hour, or if your child won't behave until you do (and they've read the book!!).	2.0	Just not very good	2006-04-05	25	7	18
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AK9LN821QYQG9	Neal J. Wertanen	"WOW is all I can say. The film followed the book about 95-98%. The early reviews were right, its a movie for children and a movie for adults w/ inner children still.It is a movie about growing up, and not knowing how to feel about it. About suddenly having responsibility and owning up to it, all the while not loosing track of the wonder of childhood, and what it is to be a child. A truely great movie.It also is a movie I could see alot of people not liking or missing the point of, but then there will be the fortunate ones who do get it and let it touch them inside and be transported, like I was, to this magical land of Narnia and go on this amazing ride w/ these four exceptional kids.However this is the all important key, I feel, to enjoying this movie; you have to want to enjoy it, to let it entrance you. If you're skeptical in the least, you will be disappointed. This isn't ""Lord of the Rings"", although the similarities are impossible to ignore, however LOTR has more depth and well more time to do things right. Narnia is a different story, and a good one too and also a faithful adaptation of its source material.By far my favorite moment is about 12-15 minutes into the movie, when little Lucy (who by the way steals the movie, and is just adorable and, as w/ all the kids really, is incredibly good in the movie) first enters the wardrobe and steps into the snow forest of Narnia. The expression on her face and the beautiful music in the scene (and the whole movie really) just make one of the precious few movie moments that you remember all your life. Like when Dorothy enters Oz or when Darth Vader comes aboard the rebel transport in the original Star Wars or the D-day battle in Saving Private Ryan. Its just an amazing moment.The film is about 2 hours and 15 minutes or so, but never feels like it. As I said, its only like 12 minutes and you get your first glimpses of Narnia and the plot begins. Also the opening 2-3 minutes showing the 1940 bombings of London (the blitz) are short but very powerful, and the following scene where the children are getting there identification attached to there clothing by there mother in the train station before being sent out to the countryside along w/ all the other children is just a heart wrenching scene, and very early makes you feel and care about these kids alot.I look forward to a possible extended edition DVD, as LOTR did, but at the same time I don't know what they'd add. The movie is a great fantasy film, and great way to escape into a marvelous world for a few hours."	5.0	If you let it, Narnia will amaze you. A great movie.	2005-12-11	9	6	3
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A36RS3ZMNE9JSQ	Negative Comments	"I don't think I've ever used the phrase, ""a movie everyone can enjoy"" to describe a movie, but I'll do it here. OK, done. I'll give props where it's due, for a PG movie for kids, this was surprisingly engaging, non-clich&eacute;, and very, very well written.There aren't a lot of fantasy movies I like, and that has to do with the way they're presented to you. They present the world to you in an already existing state, bombarding you with everything without gradually introducing you to its various elements. They present these life or death scenarios without truly exploring why we're supposed to care about the world's inhabitants in the first place. I like this movie because we're learning about the world at the same rate as the four kids here (assuming you haven't read the books, which I haven't). In fact, it was the great acting done by the kids that kept me interested enough in the ""pre-fantasy"" portions of the movie before we finally entered the fantastical realm, after which I cared enough about the characters to be invested in their ultimate outcomes.**The character Lucy single-handedly kept me interested with her GREAT acting in the beginning where she was prominently featured. She was better than a good 70-83% of grown actresses that I've seen, and probably 98% of child actresses not named Dakota Fanning and a select other few. I loved her response when asked by the faun about the human beings' hand-shaking ritual. ""Yeah, I don't know, why DO we do that??""**I loved the interaction between the kids. I loved the tension there. In most PG movies the good guys are usually black and white, you don't have ugly things like traitors, jealousy, and greed.**A mark of a well-written movie is how many times you DON'T have to say to a character on screen, ""why are you doing that?"" or ""why AREN'T you doing this?"" Prime example, in the beginning after Lucy returned from Narnia as she re-entered the wardrobe, the character specifically knew that she had been gone for apparently hours, so as she re-enters, the first thing she does is to shout out to everyone who inevitably will be worried about her, that she's OK. After they question her, she then realistically asks, ""wait, what? You mean to tell me that after our hide and seek game, from your perspective I must've disappeared for hours, and you didn't wonder where I was???"" That's perfect. That's exactly how a real person would behave, and the actress pulled off the well-written lines just as perfectly, as she questioned her siblings with a confused look. I'm pointing this out because I can specifically think of other movies with analogous situations where the lines the character would've said would've been ALL wrong, and the intonation with which the actor delivers the line would've been so unrealistically understated.I only have a couple complaints:**When the lion is lying dead on the concrete slab, and Lucy and Susan go up to him, I don't understand why Lucy was so easily talked out of using the injury healing potion she was given by...Santa Claus earlier. She first begins to use it, but then is told by Susan that it's too late, implying that since he's already dead, the potion would do no good since it's meant to heal injuries only. But how did she know the exact boundaries or properties of this magic elixir? It's MAGIC. How do you know that it won't revive him? No one specifically ever defined its limitations. Besides, what's the worst that could happen? Just pour the liquid on his wound, worst-case scenario is you get red dye on his fur (I didn't know until later you're supposed to consume the potion, not apply it directly to the wound).**I didn't like the sword fighting scene between Peter and the witch. It just looked weak, like they were struggling to swing the sword(s). Peter, I can understand, since he's a kid, but the witch should have been a lot smoother using the dual swords.**This one is minor, but, the grown versions of the kids at the end just looked very goofy.Those are hardly plot holes or badly written scenes however. If my only major gripe about a 2 hour+ movie is the non-use of a Phoenix Down on a fallen Red XIII, then it's a pretty good movie. Sure the overall arc of the story may have been predictable, but there were still plenty of dramatic moments along the way and you enjoyed the ride. The plot didn't feel contrived, it was believable for what it was, and the characters are extremely likable, to the point where I was hoping that even the CGI animals don't get hurt or killed. This movie has a lot heart and certain charm to it that leaves you happy for seeing it.***Random personal trivia: I finally saw this three years after the movie had come out, but it wasn't random. I've always had it in the back of my head that I would eventually get around to seeing this, and it was all because of an enduring three second image in my head that I remembered when they advertised this movie on TV. It was the scene at the end showing a front view of the lion and the four kids as they walk towards the camera, towards the coronation area. As corny as it sounds, there was just something noble and inspirational about that scene."	4.0	a satisfying, solid fantasy movie that even the harshest critic can enjoy (like myself)	2008-12-26	0	0	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2M3K0QDZ4IUUF	Never Lander	"Christian correlations aside, this is a phenonenal film.  The young actress playing Lucy shows a prowess beyond her years.  Any fan of CS Lewis will find this film amazing and at the same time lacking.  Just like his friend JRR Tolkien, Lewis creates and to a certain extent lived, in a world of imagination and therefore, his creation is vivid and hard to translate to the big screen.  Andrew Adamson and Peter Jackson did a phenomenal job bringing them to the screen.CS Lewis wrote this series and astonished the world of Christian Literature.  How a middle-aged man could write so convincingly from a child's perspective was baffling.  CS Lewis, along with his brother Warnie lived in their childhood and clung to the Norse myths like they were beloved blankets, never found without them.CS Lewis, of course, was a skeptic/agnostic and was brought to Christ in his mid 20's.  He never lost his childlike faith that made him a visionary of Christian Literature up there w/ the likes of AW Tozer.Bottom line is that, although Andrew Adamson said he consciously tried to ""de-Christianize"" this film, it is impossible.  The Christian iconography is inherent in the story and was such an integral part of the storyline that it could not be avoided.  Adamson even had Aslan utter the line ""It is finished"" when he destroyed the white witch.The film may be a bit tough for children.  Even Lewis understood that to a child, harm to an animal is often worse than harm to an adult.  What an insigt for a man that spent most of his life among literary giants rather than small children.  Therefore, in his series, the only book where animals are killed in large numbers is the last battle and a few pages later, they are resurrected with Aslan in the new Narnia (Representing the New Jerusalem, where Christ (Aslan) will reign in majesty).The death of Aslan is graphic, as it should be, and will be hard for children to digest.  But his ""deeper magic"" is a doorway to discuss Christ's love for us as sinners.  Be sure to talk to your children so they don't come away confused and understand the allegories rather than the reality of the story.One could debate all day the film deficiencies when translated from literary form.  Bottom line is that Adamson has done a sturdy job bringing Aslan to life (3 years alone to create a believeable CG lion that after years of failed attempts to make talking animals, actually looks like it is speaking) and telling his story.To the final scene where Aslan walks off down the sandy beach (the poem ""footprints"" is brought to mind for this scene), the film is beautifully executed.  Adamson could not destroy the Christian message of redemption and salvation and his ""Narnia"" is a world of wonder and spectacular vistas.Be sure to watch Lucy's face the first time she steps into Narnia.  You will feel like a child again yourself.  CS Lewis would be proud.  He was adamantly against any attempt to bring Aslan to the screen/stage and stated they would all fall short of his writing of Him.  I believe he would be startled at the vision on the screen.My only scene beef is when Aslan roars and the children respond.  In the book, Aslan's roar is such that the children tremble with fear and awe.  I wanted to see a bit more of that on the children's faces.Overall, a fantastic job, bravo..."	5.0	Lion of Judah!	2006-09-01	8	6	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AOJ691J3ZW3NK	Nicholas R. Patti	I enjoyed this movie to the extreme!  The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is, without question, one of the best (and most successful) films to be released from the present decade.  This highly anticipated motion picture has proven itself to be popular with people of all ages the world over.  When I went to go see this I was greatly captivated by the story's central players.  The four main protagonists (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) each have extremely unique personalities.  Once agian, the film, its story, and its characters made me glow all over with happiness.  The beginning of the picture is somewhat interesting whilst the ending is intensely overwhelming.  I sparkled with pleasantness when our heroes came out on top.  I have every intention on purchasing the DVD when it gets released.  In my opinion, the movie itself deserves to be honored and crowned!Long live the realm of Narnia!	5.0	This movie is a monstrous triumph!	2006-01-23	4	4	0

Therefore I did not have any preconceived ideas or expectations and merely looked at it as a new and highly touted fantasy movie. I was bored to tears. This movie including the fantasy creatures and ""battle"" scenes are a bad rip-off of the excellent ring trilogy. The acting is horrible, wooden and emotionless. The kids seem to be reading their lines of cards while staring in the camera. Not one of them had any appealing quality. Background looks fake, especially watching on a large TV. And why are certain animals good and others bad??? Who came up with this crazy idea?

But since the box office has been putting out movies that puts the z in snooze, I started wondering about this film.  First I decided to read the book and instantly ordered the complete works, but I had no time to read it before the film was released.  So tonight I went to see this film with no expectations: and I LOVED IT.No one will win any acting awards, but I utterly loved the fantasy that was created.  I wasn't lost or wondering what was happening as some reviewer said.  The story was pretty simple to understand, but I clearly see where authors like Limmy Snicket and even J.K Rowling got their inspiration.This story is obviously the blueprint to some of the new 'classics' children are reading today.The film accomplishes exactly what it's intended to do: entertain.

Based on a series of C.S. Lewis books this is yet another excellent addition to the heroic mystical fairy tales which have included ""Lord of the rings"" and ""Harry Potter"".The story of 4 siblings who accidently come upon a gate way to another land is adorable. The land gripped by an evil ice witch, can only be saved by the human siblings and a warrior lion named Aslan. The sibings must find not only their way accross the plains, forest, mountains and lakes, but also must find the willingness in themselves to become true noble, leniant, valiant, caring kings and Queens of Narnia.The bad part is some of the special effects weren't as clean as they should have been Post ""Lord of the rings"" ( which basically created a blueprint for this type of film). The mythological beasts and animals often looked like cardboard cut outs. Also some of the acting was a little over the top, often felt like an middle school play.But, nonetheless a pleasant adventure, i wasn't bored and made me smile at the end.

I confess that when I first heard about the project I had my doubts. Firstly, I wasn't sure that the excellent BBC version could be significantly improved upon. Secondly, I was afraid that they would ""modernize"" and thereby cheapen or destroy the classic. My fears were baseless. In my opinion this film is superb in every category- acting, special effects, computer animation, sets, costumes, etc. Yes, there were a few small liberties taken with the original storyline, but nothing major. This is absolutely true to the spirit of the original and the best adaptation yet. No doubt this will be the classic and definitive film version for generations to come.As for the special features, you get Narnia ""bloopers"", fun facts, and audio commentaries.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A27G3XOXB02R1C	OtherWorlds&Wisdom	Narnia falls somewhere in between Harry Potter and Middle Earth, being directed at younger audiences like Potter, but with a detailed world and epic battles like Lord of the Rings.Follows the book fairly closely, but this is not your modern, silly kids book. The film opens with the bombing of London in WWII where the kids are evacuated to the countryside. Once in Narnia, the kids encounter a wide array of creatures (friend and foe). Not as epic feeling (until the end) as LOTR, but nor is the book. It's a short book and stretching it to just over 2 hours and still having a fairly good pace is an achievement.The visuals were done by 3 or 4 of the world's leading FX companies, a first on any movie. This was necessary because all of the residents of Narnia are either animals, creatures or half-human beings.I hope the film makers will release an extended edition DVD with all the extras, like the LOTR maker's did. This fantasy series deserves the same A+ treatment. Disney is expected to announce the first sequel shortly.	5.0	Finally, Lewis' Book Given the Five Star Treatment	2005-12-12	9	5	4

It's so full of beautiful scenery, clever dialogue...and such amazing fantasy characters!  I loved it. It's a kids' movie, but it's just as entertaining for adults. There's a great plot and it's more or less what you want it to be. If you are a Christian, you can see lots in it (the gifts that the children receive are like the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Aslan is a type of Jesus, etc. The witch has satanic attributes.  Edmund's journey is very much like that of the Prodigal son) but if you are not a Christian, it can be a simple adventure movie with heroes and antiheroes and basic moral lessons to be learned:  the children learn to stop squabbling and get along. Each one matures and learns to be obedient and compassionate. There's a lot about forgiveness and hope and courage and joy and love... it's a great movie and the character of Aslan is really beautiful: gentle and mighty at the same time.  Just beautiful. So many kids' movies these days are full of lame jokes and cheap laughs.  This one is a classic, a real keeper...	5.0	Best movie!	2006-03-03	9	9	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1ZMCLGK23FZIT	"Patrick Hodges ""Flame"""	"For those of you who aren't familiar with the story, I'll give you a brief overview (which won't spoil anything): We start off with the four Pevensie children who are sent away from their mother and home in England because of the dangers of World War II. They arrive at a huge, old mansion to live with a mysterious professor. While the children are playing games, they discover a wardrobe hidden upstairs which takes them into the magical world of Narnia. We soon discover that Narnia is under a spell which makes it ""always winter and never Christmas"", and it has been this way for nearly 100 years. In this fantastical world there are talking animals, both good and bad, and the awesome King of Narnia, The Great Lion, Aslan...... The story that follows - which I won't tell you any more because I hope that you will experience it for yourself - is an exciting story of hope, courage, faith, sacrifice, and love; and is truly one of the most beautiful stories I have ever heard.I am a huge fan of the Chronicles of Narnia series - they are simply my favorite fiction books that I've ever read. In saying that, I was extremely interested in seeing this movie and seriously hoping that they would do it correctly. Having now seen the film, I don't think I could be more pleased with the loving adaptation.First (in my analysis of the film itself), I think they captured the theme and tone of the book perfectly and these are truly felt in watching the movie. It isn't your 'typical' Disney style of movie, nor did they give it a politically-correct treatment. Christianity is woven into these stories and is necessary to give Narnia its magic. C.S. Lewis has even said that Aslan is the representation of what Jesus would be like were he to enter Narnia (not in those exact words, but close to them). And almost to my surprise, they did not hide the story's Christian themes whatsoever. As a Christian, myself, I am so truly greatful for that.Also, the acting was absolutely superb. The children were exceptionally real as individuals and they functioned very well as the Pevensie family. Each child truly added life and depth to the movie. Also, Tilda Swinton absolutely nailed the part of the White Witch - it can't be said any better than that. She was simply perfect. Mr. Tumnus was really quite wonderful as well.The digital acting was amazing, as well. The graphics representing the characters were beautiful, that's for sure, but the care the animators took in creating the characters really shines. The beavers were magnificentally done, and the wolves were incredible, as well.But, I especially loved the way they handled Aslan. This movie just wouldn't make it if they hadn't brought Aslan to life on the screen. He really stole every scene he was in, as he well should have. I was truly in awe of him for the entire movie and I teared up the first time that I saw him. His emotions are very vivid, and he truly is terrifying, exciting, and wonderful at the same time. Also, Liam Neeson's voice was absolutely perfect for Aslan, as his voice provided the gentleness, magnificence, and awesome power necessary for Aslan's character.The adaptation from the book was incredibly done, as well. They stayed so extremely close to the source material for pretty much the entirety of the movie. I'll admit that it was a little painful to at first upon the realization that a plot point had been altered, but in the very few places this occurred, in retrospect, the additions are welcomed and truly add to the story. The characters are given considerably more depth with the additional time. Also, there are more tense scenes and action that plays out perfectly for the silver screen.The overall look and feel of Narnia is very real; we really feel like we are in Narnia and that this place does exist. The beautiful cinematography and extremely believable effects bring the fantastic land to life. Also, the animals (talking or not) provide realism. The costumed/made-up and digital characters look amazing on the screen.All around, this is just an incredible film. It is deserving of Oscar consideration in multiple categories, and I definitely believe it is worthy of Best Picture consideration. This movie has it all, and even exceeded the expectations of a person who cherishes the book. I thank all who helped to breathe life into this film, allowing countless people to enter C.S. Lewis' amazing world of Narnia. I can only hope that all seven novels will be given this wonderful treatment and that we will continue to have such quality entertainment for years to come!"	5.0	A beautiful adaptation of a timeless classic...	2006-02-09	3	0	3

The acting was as to be expected and the children did a wonderful job.If you don't know what the story is about, I suggest reading the book. It's about a set of children, all siblings, get sent to a relative's house while there is a war going on. While at this mansion, little Lucy stumbles upon a magical wardrobe. The wardrobe lands them into the chaos world of Narnia. Where it's currently under the control of the Witch. When the 4 kids come into the Narnia land, things start to change for the better. The Witch becomes weaker, Aslan comes back to the land and the Sons and Daughters are presented with the thrones to be Kings and Queens of Narnia.There is magic, there is fighting, there is loss, there is creation.

They could have gone over the top of it on the rocks...LIKE THE WOLVES DID! but I guess they needed another climax, it was a good scene just funny that the wolves could figure it out and not the ""king and queen""Secondly, why did the wolf jump onto the sword and kill himself. He was purty =(Last...and so far I am the only one who caught this, at the beginning of the movie Lucy gave Thomas her hanky. Then when Thomas was captured, the beaver gave it back to her.

That version is cheesy, and does not have the graphics, but believe it or not I liked it much better then this one. There is something missing from this film. The magic and and intrique just isnt there. It starts off alright, but right away I didnt feel any connection to the actors except Lucy. Edmund is just alright, not bratty or realizing enough. Susan got on my nerves the most, I couldnt stand her. Peter was ok. Lucy was adorable and did a fabulous job. Anyways one of my biggest annoyances was there was no real shock that narnia exsisted. They just kind of take it with a grain of salt and you dont get that huge discovery. The witch should have been alot meaner and the scene with her and edmund really bothered me. It was just missing so much acting wise, dialouge wise, feeling wise, compared to the BBC version. Now the CG in this film is ridiculous, the beavers are just so fake looking. They look so out of place. Same with the wolfs, even aslan to me, just to over the top animated looking. Narnia was very computerized and could have been alot more magical and alluring. I liked the faun, I liked the scene where they fall into the river on the ice piece, but that my friends is about it.

I, like many, have felt a slight itch to read them now, since the movie release was somewhat of a reminder that the books even existed. I wanted to see the movie first, though. I wanted watch with attention devoid of geeky ""this-is-nothing-like-the-book"" bias.As I lay in bed on my lazy Saturday afternoon watching The Chronicles of Narnia, I definitely had the longing to be sitting in a dark movie theater, losing myself in the action on the giant silver-screen. Seeing it on DVD was not a bad thing, but I think if I had taken the time to see it in the theater it would have definitely been a good thing.In the ""books we read as children turned movies"" category, The Chronicles of Narnia was geared more towards children than Tolkien/Jackson Lord of the Rings movies.In the ""books my children may or may not have read turned movies"" category, The Chronicles of Narnia may have even been a little less sophsiticated than Harry Potter. Forgive me for saying that in The Chronicles of Narnia it seemed that a few more things were a little far-fetched. I know it seems ridiculous that I say that a young boy, his brother and sisters leading a war against an evil witch is far fetched, though the fauns and centaurs they lead into battle and a completely different story about an entire school of young wizards were completely acceptable.Some of the effects were flawless. The CG lion was masterfully done, as were most of the panoramic views. There were so many beatiful scenery shots, but some appeared lazily done. Maybe the design team had to cut a few corners, but the kids looked too blatantly super-imposed at times. This is a petty complaint, and my only one really.I had fun watching The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.

Lewis was both Dom of Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the UK at the same time. Both C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien were classmates and both were understudies of George MacDonald their professor. You can see if you read MacDonald's works. C.S. wrote on the ""Light Side of Things"" -positive whereas J.R.R. Tolkien wrote on the ""Dark Side of Things""-negative.The Chronicles of Narnia is wonderful. I believe superior in everyway to Lord of the Rings. I have read just about everything that Lewis has written. Some of his critics falsely accused him at one point for using ghost writers. He was exonerated completely. Lewis had the gifting of being able to write in several different styles as if he were several different writers. This is unique as far as my reading experience is concerned.C.S. Lewis said of his Chronicles that his series would appeal to the very young and to the very Mature Adults. I love the Chronicles as an older Adult. So when you've grown old enough come back to Narnia where all are young at heart."	5.0	Better then Lord of the Rings I'll tell you why.................	2007-01-12	6	4	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A13DQTXG02HZC1	Ping Lim	Andrew Adamson is good at what he does best.  He can make adults and children laugh and cry at his whim.  Referring to the interview that he had given, he was brought up with the book and thus, he was adamant that the movie was to be as faithful to the book rendition as much as possible.  Some readers commented that it's not 100% accurate, well, to have the book been converted into a movie is by no mean an easy feat.  The stars of the show would definitely be those adorable children.  Special effects in this instance is second rank with some really shoddy resolution.  Then, there's the deja-vu with Lords of the Ring Trilogy and I can't blame them when you could see towards the end credits that costumes and weapons are derived from WETA (special effects wing of Peter Jackson's production company).  I think that a movie shall be enjoyed for what it is rather than this discussion about the Christianity element in it.  If that's the case, what's so wrong about it when Christianity is to preach people to do the moral things?  Ultimately, this movie is about the magic that we possessed when we were young and then, we lose it when we get older.  It's all about faith and hope in believing in the little children that is in all of us.  By the way, Tilda Swinton is absolutely superb and Liam Neeson's majestic voice is superb.  Highly recommended for family viewing.  It's overall a good movie but not a great one.  It shall be interesting to see if there is any sequel coming out of this one.	3.0	Deja-vu	2005-12-18	5	0	5

It is different than most of the stuff that's coming out on dvd right now, so that's a plus to it.Anyways, off to the things that bugged me about this movie. I found it really dumb how they found Narnia. I know it's suppose to be fantasy and not rl, but it was still dumb. They were in reality...then entered a wardrobe, of some place they were sent to, and for some reason in that EXACT building lies the entrance to a whole new other world. The other thing that bugged me was the fact that, all of a sudden, these kids knew how to fight. They actually had the guts to stand up and fight minotaurs. Minotaurs for christ sake! They could've just sat on the kids.It was just dumb. These things didn't completely ruin it for me, but it still bugged the crap out of me. If this was fixed, than I would have given it 5 stars. Oh, and another thing. Animals were talking. The kids didn't even act surprised that they saw the talking beaver. Nothing...not even a ""Oh my!"". ""Alright kids, im a beaver that talks so...follow me!"" ""OK, lead the way!""If I were a kid, I would love this movie so much. I would overlook that kind of thing, but the thing is, im not.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2N9E02BZYBU7K	"Plom de Nume ""Rob"""	"This wonderful movie gives us back the ""special effects film"" proper. Here's hoping it helps to wean younger viewers (and older ones who should know better) away from the ""might-as-well-be-a-cartoon"" overkill of the Matrix and other CGI-fests - even Jackson's Kong has, for me, one dinosaur-chase too many - and back to the mythopoeic splendours of true cinema artists like Ray Harryhausen. Setting aside the technical verisimilitude of 2001 and the zooming rockets of Star Wars, it's no coincidence that the previous benchmark for really special special effects was ""Jason and the Argonauts""; bringing mythology to life - that is, putting real performers in the frame with mythical beasts - is the modern age's equivalent of Ovid and the rest doing it in narrative poetry. With Narnia, we finally get a worthy contemporary inheritor of those legacies, cinematic and literary.Of course, one of the secrets of a great ""special effects film"" is that the wizardry is complemented by excellence in other areas. Narnia gives us, for a start, some genuinely good child actors (English ones, to boot!) for our protagonists. The young performers here manage to convey emotion and just the right level of anachronism to chime with the story's wartime setting, without resort to jarring Harry Potterish bum notes of trendiness (or that series' often wooden, school-play delivery of the juvenile dialogue). Georgie Henley in particular is absolutely pitch-perfect in her depiction of little Lucy's delight, terror, sadness, and, above all, innocent wonder - the perfect ""Disney kid,"" in fact (and much, much better than that brand might imply).The Narnia grown-ups are also fantastic, similar streaks ahead of the Potter adult rota: compare James Cosmo's brief and brilliant Father Christmas here with the Dumbledores of Harris and Gambon, for example. Better still, put Tilda Swinton's subtly terrifying White Witch against any of cinema's fear-queens and she's going to come out at the top. James McAvoy's faun is a touching demonstration of that actor's striking versatility.Meanwhile, on the voice-over front, we have Ray Winstone's delightful Mister Beaver (paired with a Dawn French thankfully restrained from making this character ""her own"" (i.e. not funny)), a great, appropriate fox from Rupert Everett and many other fine vocalisations, culminating in a gloriously leonine sound-portrait of Aslan from Liam Neeson.The story is already established as a modern classic; the screenplay is pretty faithful. Pacing, cinematography (a glorious colour palette is on view throughout) and music are all fine, too. But the breath is most taken, of course, by the beautifully-integrated effects. When I spoke of the voice-over performances just now, you have to see what amazing justice is done to the real actors by their animated counterparts (and vice-versa). Facial expressions, body-language, authentic animal behaviour and anthropomorphic adaptations are welded in magnificent style, convincing and entertaining at the same time. The wolves look as real as the centaurs; the demons are as alive as the cheetahs; the gryphon (the gryphon!) is somehow truer to ""life"" than, say, any of the Black Beauties we've seen filmed. The phoenix is astounding. In true Jason style, we also get a harpy, taunting Aslan on his way to his execution.The masterpiece in this gallery of wonders, indeed, has to be Aslan; the lion is real; super-real; moving just for being so beautifully realised, before we even come to the deeper emotion of his sacrifice. This scene, if you were in any doubt before, convinces us that we're watching art in motion. I haven't seen Bosch paintings move before, but this riot of grotesques would grace any canvas of his, or Duhrer's. Clive Barker would probably recognise the more hellish dimension of the scene, too. Tilda Swinton is at her most chilling here; and the quasi-religious pathos outdoes Mel Gibson's sadistic little go at it in ""The Passion of the Christ"" by many miles. It's at least as horrific as, and much more touching than, Edward Woodward's exit in the Wicker Man; cinematically no less significant, either - this is, at most levels, a ""children's"" film (and definitely an ""effects"" film), so the compliment to intelligence and maturity is much appreciated: yes, we can respond to sacrifice without the conventional frameworks, thank you.In every respect, Narnia is one of cinema's genuine and precious works of art. It's brilliant; you should see it. And if it's going to be classed as an effects, fantasy and/or kids' film, then it has to be installed at the top of all those categories. For my money, though, it should be put firmly in the classic ranks; and actually rated as one of the finest of all time."	5.0	Art in Motion	2006-05-14	5	2	3

Jesus is the only hope. He is called the lion of the tribe of Judah. CS Lewis was a committed Christian who understood the power of GOD in Christ. Jesus gave HIS life, died on the cross to pay for mankind's sins. Then HE rose from the dead so that we could have our hope in the only ONE who conquered death.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1TAWJ2PA3USVX	"P. M Simon ""El Simon Asombroso"""	"There have been many previous versions of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, the first volume of Oxford Don C.S. Lewis' beloved children's classics, 'The Chronicles of Narnia.'  This version is by far the best.The basic plot:  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is the story of the Pevensie children, Lucy, Peter, Edmund, and Susan.  The are sent out of London during the Blitz and fostered in the home of the mysterious ""professor.""  During a game of hide and seek, the youngest child (Lucy- brilliantly played by Georgie Henley)finds the gate to the mystical world of Narnia through an old wardrobe. Narnia is inhabited by humans, mythical beasts, and anthropomorphic creatures.  It has been under the hundred-year rule of the evil White Witch (well-done but a bit understated by Tilda Swinton).  The children fulfill a prophecy and come to lead the fight against the witch.As one might expect from Lewis, possibly the most readable theologian ever, the tale is a straight good-evil story and contains much Christian symbolism.  The sacrifice and resurrection of the Lion (of Judah) Aslan, and his descent to free the damned captives of the Witch are fairly obvious.Being as this is a children's story, it is, naturally, an uncomplicated tale.  The movie pulls it off well, and the CG effects are fabulous, and a good complement to the fine acting.Well cast, and with appealing cinematography, it is no wonder the film was a hit.  The DVD is of good quality and worth owning, for adults and kids.One small caveat is that the film is unabashedly English in character and parents might have to do a little explaining.  Another small failing is that the CG of the bombing raid in the Blitz looks fairly bogus, unlike the rest of the film.But, on the whole, a superb movie to add to any film buff or parent's collection!"	5.0	Fairly Faithful, Well-Acted, and Visually Stunning	2006-03-29	2	2	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3DVPHGB4K1FIE	P. Oh	The big screen adaptation of CS Lewis's christian allegory begins on a promising note. The Pevensey children leave their claustrophobic confines of war time London for the countryside with a huge mysterious home to explore. The discovery of a magical world called Narnia accessed through an old wardrobe unfolds through the eyes of young Lucy as she meets its wondrous creatures and comes to learn that all is not right in this land. It is the last half of the movie that descends into formula and in particular the story line of Edmund's betrayal is forced and incomplete giving the pivotal moral zenith of Aslan's sacrifice a thin, head-scratching veneer. The events up to and including the final battle scene is way too long and drawn out with no plot development. Instead  seen-it before special effects are substituted culminating in a boring and overwrought battle and finale.  I don't want to comment too much on CS Lewis, as a christian apologist he has provided generations a reasoned and intellectual view of christianity - though not neccessarily in the Chronicles of Narnia. Ultimately the books and the movie needs to be seen through the eyes of a child which was Lewis's original intent after all. That leads me to the biggest flaw which is the disturbing glorification of violence and view that one must kill to have their view and religion proven correct. It has been many years since i breathlessly read all the Narnia books and whether Lewis or the filmakers took the heavier hand i cannot recall but it is a terrible message wrapped in the appealing gloss of a movie aimed at children.	2.0	Promising beginning gives way to disturbing formula	2006-04-10	22	9	13

But about this movie it was virtually identical though of course (as always) a few liberties were taken, though nothing that ripped the book apart. the biggest discrepancy between this movie and the book was the battle that only lasted 2 pages in the book but takes up a larger part of this movie crowding out the interesting part where Aslan frees the stone captives of the witch. also was the frozen river scene, where the Pevensies are trapped between a melting frozen waterfall and Maugrim.

They have gone to live in the country side, where they will be safe from the destruction of bombs and air attacks.  Peter, the eldest, feels as though he must take on the role of the parent in this upsetting situation, and he often argues with his brother Edmund, who tries to hide his bitterness about the war by picking fights with his siblings.  Susan is the second eldest, and, like Peter, tries to encourage her younger siblings while also being realistic about the situation.  Lucy is the youngest, and despite the fact that she is young and usually has to be taken care of by Peter or Susan, she is really very brave.  The children are now living with a professor in a spacious mansion, which they find is the perfect setting for a game of hide-and-seek.  But when Lucy hides in a mysterious wardrobe in a back room, she is taken to an amazing world.  But this is only the beginning of an unbelievable adventure full of suspense, amazing creatures, and an exciting battle of good vs. evil.Rarely do I say that a movie is better than the book, but this movie was absolutely incredible.  The storyline, of course, was fantastic, considering as it was based on one of the most beloved children's stories of all time.  But the thing I liked was that it was true to the story.  Parts weren't mixed around and nothing unecessary was added into it.  The acting was also fantastic, especially from Georgie Henley (Lucy) as young as she is.  The special effects were very high-tech and really made the movie.  I recommend this movie to everyone, even people who haven't read the book. (Although it's neat to see the book come to life on the screen.) Some parts may frighten small children, but for the most part it wasn't as disturbing as some movies today.Overall, it was just a work of art.

My family and I enjoyed watching the extended scenes (Disc 1), particularly the ""Battle for Narnia"".  I was pleasantly surprised by both Disc 3 and Disc 4.Disc 3 "" C.S. Lewis - Dreamer of Narnia"" is a movie that educates the viewer about the man behind the ""Narnia"" series.  Lewis' story is told in a very creative way.  It opens with footage of a real lion steadily moving through a wilderness allowing us to visualize what it must have been like before and as Aslan created Narnia.  We meet various literary and religious scholars who comment on C.S. (""Jack"") Lewis and themes found in his writings in a clear, respectful, and warm-hearted fashion.  We hear from a former student, a taxi driver (who gives tours of significant places in C.S. Lewis' life and tells of Lewis' impact on his life), a close friend of his wife, and Douglas Gresham (C.S. Lewis's stepson and a producer of the current theatrical movies) who shares quite personal insights about ""Jack"" and his mother.  Interspersed throughout are voiceovers of ""Jack"" reading his letters aloud, giving this movie a solid narrative.  Also included are brief scenes of children as they describe what Narnia means to them (in single sentences) and read excerpts from the books.  I truly enjoyed this movie and found it quite educational.  Parental discretion is advised since footage of WWI (actual footage is not gory but includes frank descriptions of war), suicide, death from cancer, and alcoholism are topics that are mentioned.Disc 4 - ""Visualizing The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe:  The Complete Production Experience""  is fascinating to watch as it shows the movie (theatrical version) with inserts of various members of the production team telling (and often showing) how they approached a particular element of the scene.  The producers, director, costume designer, director of photography, set designer, special effects designers & directors, cast (live and voice actors), make-up & prosthetics designer, composer, and editor are all well-represented.  Disc 4 will probably be of particular interest to anyone who loves this film and has an interest in filmmaking."	5.0	Great Extended Version - Discs 3 & 4 are welcome additions!	2008-11-25	3	3	0

Keep in mind that the BBC version was on a low budget, the acting had its ups and downs, and it was filmed 20 years ago with people in animal costumes. I don't mind this at all. They were faithful to C.S.Lewis' words and vision. Even without CGI.I'll start with the Pros for this version:The scenery: The scenery was beautiful.The story: Despite the fact that they didn't stay faithful (which I'll get to in a minute) I give them credit for following the basic storyline...if not taking a few liberties.The Cons:This new version was just too disneyfied and modern for me. Yes, I used the word modern. The screenwriter modernized a lot of the dialogue and hammered the War War 2 point so often that I wanted to throw something.The acting was fine, but I had a serious problem with how Aslan, Jadis, and the Professor were portrayed. The BBC witch may have been over-the-top at times, but she was way more scarier than this beautiful woman who didn't once make me flinch. Oh and the line I hated the most from her:""Do you know why you are here faun? Because he turned you in. For sweeties."" Wow! Why don't we just spoon feed everything to the kiddies, shall we?Aslan (the voice) was a huge disappointment to me. I have no idea why they casted Neisom in the part. He sounded way too gentle and not enough of a lion to convince me that he truly was the king. Ronald Pickup, the man who provided the voice in BBC, was excellent. The CGI was fine.The Professor was under-written for this movie and so I could not get a good sense of who he was. He had what--2 scenes (oh and sticking on that last scene as the credits are going was not a good move on their part)The kids were fine, but I feel like the writers changed their personalities too much. Since when is Peter a coward or a bully (punished Edmund by making him wear a girl's coat---um ok...)? Susan was just kind of there...Edmund wasn't enough of a holy terror for me...and Lucy was fine.Mr. Tumnus is all right in parts, but I liked the performance from BBC much more.And though the scenery was beautiful, I did not get a sense that the kids really felt Narnia's magic...and was also disapponted that they did not seem to feel anything at the mention of Aslan's name (which is an important part of the novel).I'm giving this film 2 stars for trying to make the effort. I did buy this film (to put in my Narnia collection) and am interested to see the commentary. Maybe it will explain why they made so many changes..."	2.0	The BBC version was better...	2006-04-10	22	11	11

I am sorry for any adult that does so.  However, I did go to this movie, never having read any of the books, but merely curious about modern children's fare, and I find it superb, for children.  Or the child in us.  This movie cannot appeal to a totally ""jaded"" adult.  They will miss lust, violence, hate, revenge . . . you know, all the ""good"" stuff.  However, a child will be transported to Narnia and blown away.However, some may be more like Jadis than Aslan, and deeply resent this movie figuratively and literally.  I can easily tolerate the script and directorial approach to moralize legendary concepts such as Adam and Eve, Abel and Caine, Jesus and Satan, Heaven and Hell, providence (savior required) and self-actualization (no savior required).  Moreover, I find all these comparisons refreshing.It may be that negative critics overly compare Narnia to Hogwarts, which has a more unified theme based on witchcraft without moralizing, while Narnia portrays good versus evil, which dichotomizes and creates controversy.I mean, really, for an adult to criticize the scenery, computer generated imagery, and children actor's skills is to totally miss the point of this well-done movie targeted to children. The movie attempts to inspire imagination in children, not overwhelm with special effects.  Particularly, the child actors seemed like their characters rather than ""Academy Award nominees.""  This is important in this movie that the children seem like just regular kids-not big time movie stars.  However, the role of the white witch requires a seasoned actress.  Nurturers of young minds and souls will get the point of this movie and praise it, while aged juvenile delinquents will only seek to egg Aslan's house.It would be a tragedy if all the books are not filmed by Disney following this style."	5.0	Something good for the child in us . . .	2005-12-18	7	4	3

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AFJFXN42RZ3G2	"R. DelParto ""Rose2"""	THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA:  THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is a combination of Alice In Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, and a tame Lord of The Rings.  Readers who love good storytelling may be attracted to watch this version of C.S. Lewis' tale of four children who run inside a mysterious wardrobe into a land that remains winter all year round as a result of an evil spell left by the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).  The children later become the savior and leaders to the living creatures of the land called Narnia.  The children, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) help to restore this enchanting land to its natural splendor from the cold and evil land it has been left to be.The film may echo Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter.  However, NARNIA has the Disney touch.  The special effects as shown with the animals and human-animal creatures is quite amazing to see: The beavers, Mr. Tumnus, the faun, (James McAvoy) is a delight, the fox (voice of Rupert Everett), and Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson).  Disney's production brings Lewis' fantasy tale alive with enchantment and heroism.  In addition, the cinematography and the soundtrack are quite dramatic through out the film, especially with aerial shots of the mountainous terrain, the particular lighting that provides a religious backdrop, and the concluding cliche battle scene.What is interesting about reading and watching the cartoon version of THE LION, WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE as a child, the religious and historical references did not occur to me.  I merely read the book for the simple pleasure and the fantasy.  After viewing the film, it follows the same premise as the book with the exception to additional scenes that were made specifically for the film.NARNIA contains historical and religious references.  The opening London bombing scene applies a historical backdrop to the film, and the period in which C.S. Lewis wrote the book.  The theme of good versus evil, and in this case, the German Nazis bombing Britain.  In terms of religion, Aslan represents the God-like creature of the film that Lewis had intended in the original text of his book.Overall, NARNIA is a film that the entire family will enjoy.  The film's PG rating shows minimal violence, but scenes with the pack of wolves may scare some audience members and the scene with Aslan on the stone table may be disturbing.  Otherwise, if you like to see a imagination in movies, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA is the fantasy film to see.	4.0	Disney's Winter Wonderland	2005-12-21	3	0	3
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AE3R22OUWRDP4	"Rebecca J. Carlson ""The Highly Unlikely"""	The film is never quite as good as the book.  Why not?  Because your imagination looks better than anything that filmmakers can put up on the screen.That said, this was a decent film adaptation, as film adaptations go.  But I was hoping for more magic, more sense of epic adventure, more SOMETHING.The most moving part of the film, for me, was the opening sequence where German bombers are flying over the Pevensie home, dropping shells on hapless citizens who should be safely asleep in their beds. It was a powerful opening.  I was expecting the rest of the film to wow me, but somehow everything that came after seemed trivial compared to the senseless evil of a real life air raid.Part of the problem was the White Witch.  How can you take a villianess seriously when she dresses like an ice cream cone?  Her costuming was more frightening than she was.  It was the Lion, the Witch, and the Bad Wardrobe.I also found it tedious that in the film the children waste time discussing whether or not to stay and help the Narnians. In the book there was no hint of such waffling.But I am glad the film was made.  It is definitely worth seeing, and serves as a good introduction to the story.  Just be sure you read the book too.  It's better.	3.0	The Lion, the Witch, and the Bad Wardrobe	2007-11-15	2	1	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A281NPSIMI1C2R	"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review"""	"""And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on her. A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air. Lucy felt a little frightened, but she felt very inquisitive and excited as well... she could still see the open doorway of the wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of the empty room from which she had set out... ""I can always get back if anything goes wrong,"" thought Lucy. She began to walk forward...~The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. LewisThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe movie is a brilliant portrayal of the eternal struggle between primal forces of evil and the beauty found in the soul of purity. This purity is displayed in the youthful innocence of the four main characters (children escaping to the country during World War II) who enter a world filled with temptations that test their sense of honor and loyalty. They learn the power of forgiveness and work on their character flaws through real-life adventures in a mythical land far from their home.Tilda Swinton gives a chilling performance as the White Witch who anticipates her power with a sense of calculated precision. Her adornment of black plumage was duly noted, however it is almost a foreshadowing for a lack of ""raven's knowledge"" and definitely an omen of death. In this world of magic and mystery, knowledge of the realm's rules is still power and the ability to change a summer butterfly into stone a much less powerful art in the light of this revelation. She is a formidable enemy but seems to have detectible flaws that undermine her power.Georgie Henley's portrayal of Lucy was perfect and her curiosity infuses the movie with an adventurous spirit to propel the story forward into a beautiful destiny. The scenery alone is worth four or more viewings, but it is the mythology, eternal struggle of good vs. evil and the hero's journey that captured my full attention. The creativity is especially beautiful in scenes were a phoenix bird changes into fire to defeat the enemy.In many former attempts to bring this story to a wider audience, Aslan never seemed as real. In this movie, Aslan is a lion that is so believable; he even conveys the deepest emotions with stunning accuracy.  Normally CGI fails to capture my emotions and for the first time, I felt it finally brought eternal truths to the surface in a very accessible way. Even the forests have tales to tell and the transition from winter to summer is a beautiful contrast of death vs. life or at least a rebirth in progress.The violence seemed more an adventure and the battles more exciting than horrifying. The suspense effectively captures your attention and the plot is exciting and unpredictable (unless you have read the books, but it even kept my full attention). The animals all talk and this adds a lot of humor to the story. Throughout the movie there is a sense of rising to the occasion and overcoming your fears. In the end, this story seems as much about the internal struggle of a soul as the outward portrayal.I'm happy to have waited to watch this at home when I could savor some delicious Turkish Delights and walk about in fluffy pink ""Old Friend Women's Scuff"" slippers (they look just like the ones Lucy has in the movie - and they have them in kid's sizes too). The trivia and commentaries add additional interest, but I'd highly recommend watching:  ASIN: B000BY9VS2 C.S. Lewis & Chronicles of Narnia - The True Story of the Author of the Classic Tale (2005)If you are looking for Turkish Delights: The ingredients are as basic as sugar, water and starch, but the flavor is smooth, slightly soft and sticky and dreamy floral sweet (look for the ""rose"" flavor). It is impossible to imagine how such perfection evolves from the list of ingredients. Look for: ASIN: B000IPZF8O - Sultans Turkish Delight. These are imported from Turkey and are the best I've ever tried.I first heard this story as a young child when a teacher started to read the book to us at school when I was living in Africa. I was the only child who wanted the teacher to continue reading (I think some were too young and were scared by the Witch) and when she didn't finish the book, I had to find the books at the library and read them myself. As a longtime fan of the Narnia books, I can say I could not have wished for more in a movie!~The Rebecca Review"	5.0	Magical Journey to an Enchanted Land	2007-01-05	6	5	1

Running afoul of her strong discipline, they run and hide in a seemingly ordinary wardrobe in an abandoned room of the house, where younger sister Lucy claims to have discovered another world at the back of the closet. Literally stumbling into the land of Narnia, the four children become embroiled in a Civil War between the usurperous White Witch Jadis, and the rightful ruler of Narnia, Aslan the Lion.Firstly, the standard of acting in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is what makes this movie so great. Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley and Anna Popplewell as Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan respectively, give great performances, with special nods to Henley and Keynes as two of the most promising child actors I've seen since Pamela Franklin in 'Jean Brodie'. Tilda Swinton as Jadis is absolutely wonderful: regal, detached and most definitely evil, kudos must also go to the casting director for actually hiring an Actress, and not one of the several million Jessica Biels that lurk out there.Direction is fitting: this is not a story where you skimp on showmanship, and Andrew Adamson has done a truly breathtaking job here. There's so little wrong with this visual treatment of Narnia that it's possible to get almost totally lost in the film. And in an age where CGI effects and technical frivolity are so often used to fluff up a pedestrian style of filmmaking, that's a real compliment.CGI effects here are the best I've seen to date. Forget Harry Potter, forget the Lord of the Rings trilogy, forget Episode III: ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is the current king of computer-generated plausibility. There were only two scenes where I felt ""fake!! that's fake!"", and those were (rather inexplicable) bluescreened backdrops. The creatures, the vistas, the spells, the battles... and Aslan the Lion is indescribable. You just have to see it to appreciate it.Production design is also magnificent. Narnia's various inhabitants are as varied as they are individual. From the mythic, like Giants, Hags and Naiads, to the real, like cheetahs, beavers and horses, the nonhuman inhabitants are memorable because of their sterling design. Jadis is incredible-looking, a sort of tribal queen with a real sense of power about her... and understated, considering what overstatement they could have come up with. And the countryside itself is magnificent: real and generated scenery blend here to create a backdrop that's wholly convincing, and very true to the spirit of the original book.Also, the movie's plot follows the novel closer than anything I've seen for a long time. Sure, there are changes, but for the most part, this huge fan of CS Lewis can tell you that they're not a big deal.My one quibble is with the script. Some of the dialogue feels too modern and a little too grown-up for the children. There's a glaring disparity between some of the comedy and the rest of the characterisation. The Witch and Susan seem to suffer the worst of these excesses, but worry not: it's mostly a convincing and standout screenplay.I can't recommend this highly enough. Easily the equal of the Harry Potters and Lord of the Rings, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" deserves all the praise you can think of, and then some.Buy it now!"	4.0	Spectacular!	2006-04-07	12	11	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	ANUBY6KOT60WH	R. Galeano Valencia	I have loved C.S. Lewis classic fantasy tales forever and was hesitant about the upcoming movie by Disney. However, I actually ended up watching it with my husband and my kids (6 & 7 years old) FIVE TIMES while it was playing at the movie theater. None of us got even close to boredom each time. And we have already got the 2-disc special collector's edition DVD. The important thing with Narnia from my point of view, is that it represents an entirely different sent of values than those praised for and enhanced in other success movies for kids  (such as, for example, the Harry Potter series). In the Harry Potter movies we find endless references to elements from the esoteric, magic and even witchcraft which is of course entertaining but from my point of view could also be negative for the young soul. Whereas in Narnia from the very beginning  a deep message can be foreseen that conveys a whole different set of values. Being essentially a theologian C.S. Lewis' intention of leaving a strong Christian message is fully achieved both in the books as well as in the movie, which I found great. Kids immediately connect with the Penvensie children and particularly (in my case) with Lucy Pevensie (remarkably portrayed by Georgie Henley). The movie comes across so visually attractive, with even great battle scenes and with such a powerful embedded message that it has undoubtedly already become a classic for kids and a delight for each and every member of the family.	5.0	A delight for the whole family	2006-04-14	3	3	0

Higgins ""lostboyblue"""	"In these recent days of Computer Enhanced - 'Epic-Movie-Making', I feel that there are those in Hollywood that reign supreme when it comes to weaving the visuals that accompany these magical stories from our childhood. Stories that include, but are not limited to.. ""The Lord Of The Rings"", The ""Harry Potter"" Series, and now the additon of the 3 movies that will be the ""Chronicles of Narina"" films.Obvioulsy Mr. Peter Jackson and his crew are responsible for doing what no-one had done before when recreating the world that IS ""The Lord Of The Rings."" They used traditional movie making , applied a few special effects, both computer enhanced and more traditional...AND... Jackson and his crew paid attention to the details and did it big, without over-doing it.Then there is Alfonso Cuaron who directed a beautiful, albeit short, ""Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban."" He filmed a fluid piece of movie-making.. captured some great elements from the books and played it all out with some fantastic visuals that looked more magic-made than Hollywood. From where I sat, it was the best of all the Harry Potter films I have seen including 'Goblet of Fire'And now we come to the 'Narnia' films.. and here I am slightly disapointed. These books are so great. While not being lengthy stories, that words on the pages bring in fantastic images from places and things that brought our own world into play with the beings of Narnia. It made me, as a child, really explore my imagination and relate what I knew about ,to the fantasy that I was reading.So from the films, I wanted to see that magic being played out tactfully, and clearly..and with some tempo. I just didnt see that. The Cinematography was bland at best.. the adaptation of the story was sufficent, but the visuals were barely worth the millions they spent on them. It just looked a bit cheap to me.I know it can be done.. we have seen this new breed of CG enhanced filmaking work. I want this to work, but I want more from it..and I want my imaginations worth of screen time to look damn good.(Peter Jackson did it SO well.. )"	3.0	Have We Learned Nothing?	2005-12-11	15	6	9
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3M4UU1YLBG6ZU	Richard	As a lifelong fan of the Chronicles of Narnia books, I was apprehensive about a film version.  After all, I've read the books countless times over and know them start to finish, and I wasn't sure about someone else interpreting them for me (I think that most of us lifelong Narnians tend to think of Narnia as 'our own personal world').  But I was satisfied with what happened.  I will admit, I was disappointed the first time I saw it.  But after seeing it again, I realized that it was because Andrew Adamson's vision of it was different from my own.  Once I accepted this, I began to really enjoy the film.  It is clear that Adamson is a fellow Narnian, and his love of the book comes through in his filmmaking.Visually, the film is beautiful, capturing the otherworldliness of the books.  Centaurs, Fauns, Dwarves, Minotaurs, and Talking Beasts all look absolutely real.  And the Great Lion is as majestic and awesome as I had hoped.  The acting was very solid as well, particularly from the four children.  I was amazed at the performances of both Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes (as Lucy and Edmund).  The only character that let me down a bit was the White Witch- I always pictured her as more regal, more intimidating, and more sinister.  Part of this, I think, were the very weird costumes she wore, because Tilda Swinton's performance was actually very good.  The bizarre dresses and dreadlocks kind of took away from that.For the most part, the film was true to the book.  There were a couple of scenes added which I thought enhanced the story, in particular the opening scene of the Blitz in London, and more scenes of the childrens' interaction before they entered Narnia.  The biggest change was probably the introduction of the Fox character, who is only briefly mentioned in the book.  However, I liked the Fox quite a bit.  Another highlight was the handling of Father Christmas, which could have been incredibly cheesy (I always thought that it seemed a little awkward even in the book).  But instead of yo-ho-ho, he was portrayed as a wise old warrior, and I was sorry to see him exit so quickly.I have read some critique about the Christian undertones in the film, but there's little to criticize.  The genius of C.S.Lewis's work is that he infused his faith into his fiction without being preachy or beating the reader over the head with it.  As a Christian myself, I was glad that Adamson did not attempt to gloss over or secularize the the themes that Lewis put into the work.  But they're really only there if you're looking for them.  I loved the books for years before I became a Christian, and was actually quite surprised to find that my favorite books had a Christian allegory woven so well into the story that I had never noticed it before.  Lewis always said that the story came first, and that allegory was never his intention.  Because of this, I think that non-Christians will not be offended or even necessarily take note of the spiritual themes, or may interpret them in another way.  As Lewis intended, its a great story, first and foremost.Now, all they have to do is make films of the other six...	5.0	A solid and faithful adaptation	2006-08-23	3	3	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2LIF2CN6Y7D93	Rick Morris	"Yes, the movie was missing some of the best dialogue from the book, as the Harry Potter movies often thoroughly miss some of the most eloquent lines Rowling writes, but this movie was overwhelmingly faithful to the ""feel"" of the book.Obviously, there were strong Christian overtones, as with LOTR. The difference is that LOTR was symbolism (hence, Christ is Aragorn, Gandalf, _and_ Frodo) whereas Narnia is allegory, with a more direct 1:1 correlation.Some of the Christian symbolism was obvious: despite his ability to save himself and destroy the White Witch, Aslan sacrifices himself to save the undeserving traitor, Edmund. He is then raised from the dead, breathes life back into those dead because of the Witch (dead to sin), and kills the Witch, bringing life back to Narnia. He then departs with a promise to one day return.For those who are curious about further Christian symbolism:1. The movie ends with the four chasing a stag (even though they have no bows with which to shoot it). The stag is a traditional literary symbol of Christ, so of course here they are pursuing Christ. In the book, it is the White Stag, which is an unambiguous Christ symbol from the Middle Ages. (Medieval literature was Lewis' specialty, incidentally.)2. The Red Lion is another Christ symbol. Christ as a lion is a symbol derived from the Biblical Lion of Judah.3. The gryphons, not in the book, are added. The gryphon is part eagle (lord of the skies) and part lion (lord of the earth). Hence, the gryphon is Lord of Heaven and Earth. (Ring a bell?)4. The phoenix makes an appearance at the battle scene, lighting the fire which stops the armies of the Witch with a wall of fire (shades of Exodus, anyone?). And of course the phoenix is the Resurrection Bird.To the criticism of addressing an average Joe as ""your Majesty"" because it provokes pride, you may have Tom Paine on your side but you do not have the Bible, sir. God clearly promises that Christians will inherit the earth -- hence, our role as his children. (Did you think that meant inherit the title of serf?)And yes, Harry Potter is also Christian fiction.

If you don't mind, I'm going to hop on one of my soapboxes for a minute and preach to you, concerning the original order of the books, and then I'll review the movie.C.S. Lewis MENT for the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe to be the 1st in this series. You can say whatever you want, but it's the truth. I've read all of them, and I am fully aware that the Magician's Nephew is set before TLTW&TW;, but nevertheless, TLTW&TW; was published first, and meant to be first. Look at it this way. Reading the Magician's Nephew first in the series (and then reading it in the new, absolutely perverse order it has been contorted into) is like knowing, when you watch the the original Star Wars movies for the first time, that Darth Vader is Luke's father. It takes away every ounce of mystery and suspense in the movie. Read it in the original order, I beg you. It's-1. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe2. Prince Caspian3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader4. The Silver Chair5. The Horse and his Boy6. The Magician's Nephew7. The Last BattleALRIGHTY THEN! Now for the movie.Amazing. Stunning. Brilliant. Ingenious. Stupendous. Marvelous. Spectacular. Need I continue? It's without a doubt the best movie of 2005.The four Pevensie children do an AMAZING job at the acting, especially Georgie Henley (as Lucy), and William Moseley (as Peter), though I would never dream of undermining the obvious talent possessed in Anna Popplewell (as Susan), and Skandar Keynes (as Edmund). They all give a completely convincing performance, and it made me want to be in Narnia, to fight alongside Peter and Aslan, to cry with Susan and Lucy, and to be redeemed with Edmund. Rupert Everett does a great voice-over as the Fox, and the two beavers were hilarious. Though I didn't think the true splendor of Aslan was exposed as well in the movie as it is in the books, I thought Liam Neeson was a great choice for Aslan. Jim Broadbent (as Professo Kirk) also did a humurously good job at portraying his odd character. James McAvoy, an unknown, did an AMAZING job as Mr.Tumnus. He was just like the literary character, and I was blown away.The special effects, scenery, script, storyline, and everything else is wonderful as well.I plan on purchasing this movie the exact day it comes out, for sure.

Lewis' literary masterpiece.  Adamson (Shrek, Shrek 2), who directed, co-wrote and co-produced this film, has done a masterful job of bringing Lewis' remarkable book to the big screen.  TLTW&TW is the story of four British children who are shipped out of London during the German air raids over the city during World War II.  They are sent to stay in the home of an old professor.  While playing a game a hide-and-seek, Lucy Pevensie, the youngest child, disocvers and old wardrobe and hides inside and finds herself in the snowy forests of Narnia, a land that has been locked in perpetual winter for over a hundred years by the White Witch, the self-proclaimed Queen of Narnia.  When Lucy returns to the professor's mansion, her siblings so not believe her story.  However, when she visits Narnia a second time, her brother Edmund follows her through into the wintry land where he befriends the White Witch, who seduces the young lad with sweets (Turkish delight) and the promise of future power as King of Narnia if he will deliver his siblings to her.  Soon all four of the Pevensie children journey through the wardrobe into Narnia where they find the Witch seeks to kill them, as their coming is part of a prophecy which is to result in her downfall.  Edmund runs off to join the Witch and betrays his siblings, but finds himself imprisoned.  Peter, Susan and Lucy join forces with the lion Aslan and his troops to free their brother.  Much has been said about Narnia and its Christian themes and allegories, but this is a story that can be enjoyed by Christians and non-Christians alike.  And the allegories are not heavy-handed at all.  The viewer is not being beaten over the head and preached to or told what to believe.  This movie is well-written and directed.  Liam Neeson gives a great vocal performance as Aslan.  He is just right for this role.  Tilda Swinton has, perhaps, the best performance as the White Witch.  The child actors who portray the Pevensies are all delightful, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy.  The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is one of the best films I've seen over the last few years.  I'm also very pleased that Adamson is returning to direct the next Narnia film, Prince Caspian, due out Christmas 2007.  I'm already eager to see the second film.	5.0	"""For Narnia...and for Aslan!"""	2006-02-17	10	8	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2JB1M0QWBQ4FL	Roast Pork	I bought it.  I watched about a half hour.  I will not watch the rest of the movie.  The book is that good.  Watching this movie's imagery would ruin the book.  I am throwing the DVD away.  The book is on my kids' reading list, and I don't want to poison their imaginations with the movie.Each character in the book is so well developed compared to what's in the movie, and the movie is at odds with the book on several points.I especially hated the voicing for Aslan (the Lion).  He doesn't sound anything like the almighty.  He sounds like the mailman.Aslan is done in the cheapest version of animatronics, so he doesn't look mighty, and he doesn't look like the lion on the movie poster.  He looks like a fish.  His eyes are on the sides of his head.  Huge letdown.Why 3 stars then?If you're not going to read the book, you may as well watch the movie.  As a stand-alone piece, it's not all that bad.  If you will read or have read the book, I recommend that you don't see this movie, because its inferior images will stick in your head.Really, you ought to get the book and skip the movie, but I know that not everyone reads.	3.0	Did not like it.	2007-02-02	26	8	18
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe(Andrew Adamson, 2005)I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting from The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. After hearing a year and a half worth of superlatives and castigations, for it seems no one was in the middle of the road about this one, I tried my best to have no expectations. I didn't entirely succeed, but it didn't matter much; this movie is nowhere near as impressive as I was hoping (far closer on the epic-flick scale to Eragon than The Return of the King), but on the other hand, it didn't have anywhere close to as much of the rah-rah-rah feel its critics chided it for as did, say, the remake of The Hills Have Eyes that appeared a couple of months later.I'm pretty sure everyone knows the plot by now-- didn't we all have to read this in school?-- so I'll skip a synopsis and go straight to criticizing the pace of the film, since there were any number of parts of this interminable movie that could have been shortened; I will try to avoid making the same mistake while reviewing it. It's been a good long while since I've read the book (and I distinctly recall not thinking much of it; if memory serves, I made it through this and Prince Caspian, then gave up after struggling through the first half of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader), but it seems to me there was a great deal of butchery involved in the first half of this script; I don't remember the novel being anywhere near this simplistic. And yet somehow it still manages to drag as if it were chained to a wardrobe itself. The first hour of the movie could have easily been rendered down into fifteen minutes. Or, alternately, it could have been used to give us a little more insight into the characters we meet during that first hour, rather than Adamson (who also had a hand in the script) and his collaborators assuming (I'm inferring here, but I think I have a good chance of being right) that everyone, having read the books, would already know these characters, saving the scriptwriters from the chore of having to let us get to know them again. Oops.Once the action starts up, the pace of the movie quickens, but it is sorely lacking the kind of expertise found in the action scenes of Peter Jackson (or, for that matter, Mel Gibson; the climactic battle plays far more like a less-inspired Braveheart than anything in the Lord of the Rings trilogy). It almost feels as if it's a highlight reel from the book that picked up every wrong highlight it possibly could.Just didn't work for me, on any level. The only thing that redeemed it-- kind of-- was some decent acting. * 	2.0	Meh.	2007-10-11	8	3	5
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	This film version has the outer trappings of the great story, but it is so shortened that it loses a large part of its soul.  In the book, the characters are important and have intricate relationships, which are successfully portrayed in the BBC version.  However, the Disney version cuts most of it out, except for the extremely obvious.  So what is left is an adventure, with baddies warring against the goodies.  The last quarter of the film is the battle itself, which is graphically violent and excessively detailed.  The digital effects are quite spectacular, but again, this masks a rather hollow core.  What you end up with is a visual spectacle that disappoints if you want the deeper themes that are in the books.Recommended tepidly, as a pass time but not a literary experience.  As the recent Lord of the Rings Trilogy shows, a film version can succeed as a literary experience.	3.0	Good acting, great special effects, but too truncated	2009-09-06	1	0	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"My fear when I first heard that a series of films based on C. S. Lewis's marvelous CHRONICLES OF NARNIA books I was simultaneously fearful and hopeful.  I was afraid, on the one hand, that they would somehow mangle the books in translating them to the screen; I was hopeful, on the other hand, that perhaps the filmmakers would do for Lewis what Peter Jackson had done for Lewis's friend J. R. R. Tolkein and his LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.  Neither my hopes nor my fears were realized, for while this is in no way a bad movie, it doesn't come up to the level of the LOTR.This is quite a good film, and that in itself is something of an achievement.  In rereading a couple of Lewis's Narnia books lately, I've increasingly wondered if it is possible to do a great--as opposed to merely a very good--translation of these books into film.  The problem is twofold.  First, the books are quite literary in a way that Tolkein's books are not.  So much of the substance of the book consists of the manner in which Lewis addresses the reader and the filmmakers either did not try or did not succeed in finding an analog to this in the film.  On the other hand, this same manner of addressing the reader actually pads out the book, creating far more pages than a more succinct treatment of the subject would have done.  This is not a fault of the novel; far from it.  But it does leave the filmmaker with a problem with a lack of action.  Thus, anyone making a film is forced to think of ways to pad out the action.  This is the opposite problem with most adaptations of a literary source.  Usually you have too little time to squeeze in too much content.  Here there is too much time to contain the content that the novel provides.  Hence, the result is a heavily embellishment of the book.  One finds more in the movie than one finds in the book, and I'm not entirely certain that this is a good thing.  The upside is that not much that was added was bad.If the film just missed that last extra bit of magic that would have made it a masterpiece, it did manage to be at least excellent in almost every area.  They made a great decision at the outset, opting to following the ""real"" order of the books, instead of the wretched reordering brought about by Lewis's stepson and literary executor Douglas Gresham (who gets co-producer credit in the film, almost certainly an honorary designation, since his insistence on reordering the books shows he really doesn't understand them).  Think of how awful it would have been if the film series had started with the weakest novel in the series, THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, instead of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, which is the finest (though perhaps not the one most suited to translation to film--more of this below).  The music was excellent, the sets were superb, the CGI consistently excellent, the art direction marvelous.  Though the cast featured virtually no name performers, I found no problems in the casting.  I very much liked the kids in the film, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy, which is probably the most important of the four children's roles to get right.  Tilda Swinton, one of the great film actresses of the past decade, was excellent as the witch; though I thought her costuming was a bit below par.  The fake shoulders they gave her at times looked quite absurd.  Liam Neeson was a good choice to voice Aslan, though I admit that I regret Brian Cox's having dropped out of the project.  I am not aware what issues were in play in causing him to leave, but I think his extremely gruff voice would have been wonderfully appropriate for Aslan, who is not, of course, a tame lion.  The CGI for Aslan was very good and I wasn't the tiniest bit disappointed with Aslan's appearance.  Since he is the only character who will appear in every film, it was essential to get him right.  Aslan is not, as many suppose, a Christ figure.  Instead, Lewis meant him actually to be Christ as he might have been incarnated as a mighty lion in a magical land called Narnia.  To the filmmakers' credit, they did not mute the religious message at the heart of the books, but neither did they highlight it more than Lewis himself did.  I think they struck the right balance.There is a very real chance that some of the other books in the series will be more successful as films than this one.  THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, for instance, has considerable possibility as a movie, including what is quite probably the finest single character in the series apart from Aslan.  I speak, of course, of the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep.  Even THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, which is a fairly weak book, has considerable potential as a film.  And if they get THE LAST BATTLE, Lewis's non-premillenial rendering of the end of the world, right, it could end up one of the great film fantasies ever created.  I no longer fear that they will do a disservice to Lewis's books in these films, but I will continue to hope that they create something magical."	4.0	A nice rendering of C. S.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"NOTE: The comments which follow are on the special two-disc Collector's Edition, available with subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.The film is based on and seems remarkably faithful to the C.S. Lewis classic, the second in a series of seven novels. Here's the basic situation. Four siblings are relocated from their London home to a country estate to be with an eccentric uncle, Professor Kirke,  during the ""Blitz."" While playing a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy hides in a wardrobe and -- like Alice and Dorothy -- unexpectedly finds herself in a magical world. Later joined by her two brothers and sister, Lucy and they become involved in a conflict between what my grandson Cameron calls ""the good guys"" (led by a lion king named Aslan) and ""the bad guys"" (led by a witch named Jadis) at a time when a  curse (Jadis') has confined Narnia to perpetual winter but without Christmas. There is one way to break her curse -- best revealed within the narrative -- and eventually that happens but not until after a series of adventures which are always entertaining but never threatening to young sensibilities.As did Alice and Dorothy, Lucy and her companions encounter all manner of strange creatures (both allies and foes) which include hags, soldiers, a German pilot, Rumblebuffin the Giant, red and black dwarves, centaurs, satyrs, wolves, Philip the Horse, fauns, centaur archers, and gryphons. Eventually, after a spectacular battle, Jadis is defeated and the curse is ended. The special effects are stunning and I especially appreciate anthropomorphism which is never ""cute."" The actors who portray the four Pevensie children, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy, are exceptionally talented.  Cloying I can always do without.I think it would be a mistake to force comparisons and contrasts between this film and any of the Potter and Ring films. There are similarities and differences, to be sure, but none which seems to me to be especially significant. I thoroughly enjoyed this film because plot, acting, imagery, and musical score are so brilliantly integrated in the service of effective storytelling. Others may find -- and either admire or object to -- what they perceive to be the film's presentation of Lewis' Christian beliefs. What seems much more relevant to me is the emphasis on values common to all of the world's great religions and, indeed, to codes of ethics which are wholly secular. Faith, for example, as well as love, courage, devotion, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and trust. These values are affirmed but only by implication. Hence young Cameron's immediate grasp of what is ""good"" and ""bad"" in character and behavior.The production values are superb, the conflicts and their resolution are plausible, and the film's running of time of 134 minutes seems just right. This is a film which offers a great deal to viewers of all ages. As  my rating correctly indicates, I highly recommend it.The additional features provided in the two-disc Collector's Edition really are ""special"" and include a commentary in which Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, and director Andrew Adamson participate; a production commentary by director Andrew Adamson, production designer Roger Ford and producer Mark Johnson; ""bloopers""; Narnia ""fun facts""; several featurettes such as an in-depth look at cinematic storytellers, director's diary and the children's magical journey; also ""Chronicle of a Director,"" ""The Children's Magical Journey,"" and ""Anatomy of a Scene: the Melting River."" It takes about ten hours to view the two discs to completion. My guess (only a guess) is that most people will also view only those special features of greatest interest to them. My grandchildren (ranging in age from five to fourteen) seem to prefer watching only the film and do so again and again."	5.0	Entertaining Spirituality	2006-04-06	7	7	0

I also think every character was pretty well cast, like the White Witch {Tilda Swinton}, and the wardrobe is where the magic begins with beautiful scenery of Narnia and monster members of the White Witch's army, {that goes without saying} with more than a few great battle scenes that makes everything fit everything perfectly in Narnia as the way it is, like making the entire movie a cross between Indiana Jones and ""Lord of The Rings."" I remember seeing several different versions of ""Narnia"" before this movie with the BBC version and the books, neither that I remember that well, but the point is this is just another wonderful adaption that was even better than I anticipated because I didn't know what to think before I saw it and now all I can think of is how marvelous it really is."	5.0	BRILLIANT	2005-12-28	3	1	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1OX82JPAQLL60	rodboomboom	Several times in this volume of Narnia Lewis has this statement.  It speaks directly to his writing these chronicles for children: to reintroduce many of them to the world of fantasy.  Thus, his criticism of the educational system of his time which played down the fantasy world in favor of the pure intellectual, scientific one.This is not the usual fantasy however, but one informed by a true connoisseur of fine fantasy literature from his academic life and one also informed from his Christian faith.  Hence the strong symbolism running throughout.  The storyline is powerful with the viewers transformed into another world of Narnia, where the clash between good and evil is dramatically presented e.g. where it is always winter but no Christmas celebration.Children of all times will enjoy this magnificently produced and filmed version.  The casting is magnificent, with these English children and their accents and manners sharp contrast to ours in America today.  This reviewer also finds the casting of the White Witch very well done, as she seems so attractive and yet deceptive from the outset.  Perfect!For those who haven't read this to their children, see it then obtain the book and read it to and with them.  As is typically the case, the book tops even this beautiful film version with good soundtrack.Hoping Disney follows through with remainder of Narnia.	5.0	What Are They Teaching These Kids in School?	2006-04-04	6	4	2

Zwick	"**1/2During the height of the London blitz, four young children are sent off to an estate in the countryside to wait out the war in safety.  Ironically, they soon find themselves caught up in a quite different war, one that takes place in a world not their own.  For while staying at the house of an eccentric professor, the youngsters discover a magic wardrobe that leads them to a mystical land of centaurs, fauns and a whole host of anthropomorphic creatures - a snow-covered land called Narnia. The kingdom is ruled over by a wicked witch who declared herself queen after she usurped the throne from a benevolent lion king named Aslan, who is amassing a rebel army to help him reclaim it.  The children become a part of this epic battle since it has been prophesied that four young humans will arrive some day to bring about the liberation of this benighted kingdom.Based, of course, on the beloved C. S. Lewis novel of the same name, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" does pretty well in its setting-up stage as the youngest of the four discovers the strange land inside the wardrobe and tries to convince the others of its existence, but once the children become firmly entrenched in the Narnian action, the movie begins to feel too much like a warmed-over ""Lord of the Rings"" with a lot less action and far less interesting characters.  Aslan, in particular, is so drippy and sappy, so full of bromides and platitudes, that we have a hard time getting misty-eyed even when he's heading up the stairs to perform his act of ultimate sacrifice.  Speaking of which, the Christian allegory at this point is so heavy-handed and obvious that it ceases to function as allegory and just becomes slavish imitation.  And the scene with Santa Claus passing out weaponry and ammunition to barely pubescent children - how is that an acceptable image in a movie meant for youngsters?The film has a beautiful look and design, although some of the special effects shots look surprisingly amateurish and unconvincing for a film of this size and budget.  The acting by the children is passable at best, although Georgie Henley, as the youngest child, and James McAvoy as the faun, Mr. Tumnus, do establish something of a rapport in their scenes together. Tilda Swinton as the Big Bad Witch does little but harrumph around the countryside, glaring and snarling.I realize that both the book and the movie have legions of devoted followers and any attack on either is bound to elicit cries of ""sacrilege"" and ""blasphemy"" from the faithful.  But, the truth be told, ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is a pretty mediocre movie, pleasant to look at but boring to sit through."	2.0	beautiful to look at, boring to watch	2006-05-17	24	8	16

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"(Caveat - none of the contributors to The Rotten Review have actually read any of the original books, so if you're looking for a review that says that Lewis's vision has either been realized or unspeakably violated, look elsewhere.)This first entry of ""Narnia"" thrusts the Pevensie children into the mystical land where time flows of its own accord, and everybody has something to say regardless of their species.  Dominated by the coldly secular...er...evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton, from ""The Deep End""), Narnia is an ice-encrusted realm.  All who yearn for freedom wait for word of Aslan, the Lion-savior of Narnia, and for the prophecy of salvation.  Meanwhile, back in a darker land - called Earth - the Pevensie children have been exiled from their home to escape the ""Blitz"".  It's 1940, and London is undergoing an epic battle of its own, with nightly raids by German bombers.  Finding a boring refuge in the country home of Professor Kirke, it's only a matter of time before Lucy Pevensie (the youngest and most precocious of the Pevensie kids) finds the old wardrobe that leads to Narnia, and adventure.This was a good, maybe very good movie.  It's not quite great though - the plot twists of CS Lewis have been done-to-death by imitators and little here explores what made them so fresh to begin with.  The Pevensie children are immediately accepted as the ""Sons of Adam"" and ""Daughters of Eve"" who will save Narnia with Aslan, luckily with a prophecy, a magic sword, bow & arrow and other mystical forms of moral support.  Clues and other kinds of assistance fall into their lap without the script having to put them through any tests of endurance or pain that might tax them (or shock the flick's target audience).  The movie's emotional climax - the sacrifice of Aslan - comes and goes faster than one of the movie's fleet-footed wolves.  With the possible exception of Lucy, none of the Pevensie's mature into full-blown characters, and too much of the movie is given over to CGI creatures and similar effects.  For kids who feel they missed out not getting into ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Narnia"" should be sufficient substitute."	3.0	Decent, if risk-shy epic	2006-06-25	6	1	5

Watch how the wind blows on Aslan's fur, and compare the lions in this film, in ""The Lion King,"" and in a nature documentary.  Unbelievable! And the Queen's gaze was soooo penetrating!  Try it during your next job evaluation and see what happens!One disappointment:  Peter really wasn't very good with his sword.  He is an untrained kid, after all!  But his opponents practically threw themselves on his sword, which was always shiny and clean.  If something magical happened (it is a land of magic), then he should be a good fighter.  If he really was a bumbling learner, then maybe some bumbling mistakes?That was a minor complaint.  This was an entertaining film for kids and adults that makes me want to read the book again.  Now when does the next Narnia film come out...?"	4.0	Revisiting Narnia after a 30 year break is a hoot!	2005-12-19	3	2	1

I actually saw it in the theater and fell asleep several times.  Well, I bought the 4 disc DVD set and I have to admit, after several tries, I just cant' get into it.It's not as if it's a poorly made movie.  Narnia looks great!  Unfortunately nothing happens there that is worth remembering.  The acting isn't bad either.  Just unfortunately I did not finding myself caring about any of the kids or anything that happened to them.  And unlike many villains both literary and cinematic, I did not find myself dreading Jadis, the ice queen.  Likewise, I could not find myself able to cheer for Aslan and his triumph over the white witch.  I really wanted to.  I just didn't care one way or another.I found the bonus material much more satisfying to watch than the movie itself.  I understand a sequel to this movie currently in production.

Spoor ""Author, Gamer, Geek God"""	"Just got back from seeing the Narnia movie: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.YES.This is the nearest thing to a perfect adaptation that has ever been done, as far as I can remember.From the opening with the London Blitz -- giving us a graphic explanation for those too young to understand why these children were sent away from their parents to some stranger's home -- to the final return to the real world, this is a demonstration that it is unquestionably possible to take a book and turn it into an adaptation which loses virtually nothing from the original and brings that original to life. There are so many brilliant and touching points in this film that I won't even attempt to talk about them all. I'll just hit the high points.ASLAN: The prime mover behind all events, Aslan is the image on which the movie will stand or fall. And it stands, and roars triumphantly to shake the theatre and say ""I HAVE COME!"". He is not a Tame Lion. He is THE Lion, the Lion any reader of Narnia has known, whether he was Christian to begin with or, like me, never noticed the Christian imagery until someone else pointed it out.JADIS, the WHITE WITCH: PERFECT. It was startling, amazing, and somewhat disquieting to see how they managed to make her both beautiful and repellent, a woman who was lovely and yet had... SOMETHING wrong with her. And how they didn't pull a single punch. She is as devastating as winter gone berserk, a moving, lethal, gorgeous ballet of destruction.The Four Children: Stunning. Lucy is brilliantly played, and so are the others -- Edward's pettiness and the price he pays for it, Peter's almost impossible transformation from British schoolboy to young king on the battlefield, Susan's thoughtfulness crossed with overcaution... Just lovely.NARNIA: I'd spend too long babbling to even make sense. Perfect.I haven't walked out of a theater so uplifted since, well, maybe seeing Star Wars for the first few times.If you have the slightest touch of a sense of wonder in you, go see this film. No, don't wait. Do it right now.Hear the Lion Roar in the theatre. It's worth admission.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A32XW50ILWOXNO	Samuel McKewon	"You could stack the words in all seven ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" books by C.S. Lewis end to end and they might not equal just one part of ""The Lords of Rings"" trilogy. The movie based on the first Narnia book, ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe,"" has been labeled a junior version of the ""Rings"" epics, but the crucial difference is this: ""Lion, Witch, Wardrobe,"" seems spare, not overstuffed. There is just enough story here to support the two-plus hours of running time, and director Andrew Adamson (""Shrek"") eases into this potential franchise. It's pleasant but slow, content to be delightful until it knows it better deliver the action goods or risk a tepid response come DVD time - which is where kids' flicks really rake in the dough.The story is well-known: The four Pevensie children escape the German bombing of London during World War II to the country mansion of a professor (Jim Broadbent). The youngest, Lucy (Georgie Henley) hides in wardrobe during a game, and finds it keeps going into Narnia. She meets a faun named Mr Tumnus (James McAvoy) who's meant to kidnap her, or any human, on order of the White Witch (Tilda Swinton). He lets Lucy return through the wardrobe to the mansion, where her brothers Peter (William Moseley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and sister Susan (Anna Popplewell) don't believe her.They will eventually, and director Adamson stays very faithful to the source text, although that's easier to do when you have to pad the book to fill out the story.  It's all there: the conflict between Peter and Edmund, Lucy's faith, Susan's doubt, the talking beavers,  the White Witch's lair of frozen animals, Father Christmas, and, finally, Aslan the Lion, redeemer of Narnia. Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) is effectively done through computers effects; though he's not quite ""real"" like Peter Jackson's King Kong, he is majestic, and his sacrifice late in the film evokes the necessary tragedy.The Christian themes are pretty unmistakable - Aslan, sinless, dies for Edmund's betrayal of his siblings and then is resurrected the next morning - although I could imagine some viewers - especially kids - being so unaware of the Christian Gospel that it leaves little impression. Swinton, a cold, glaring beauty with piercing tone, was made for the White Witch - during the battle her stature adds an element of physicality to the character; we can believe her fighting skills. Henley, as Lucy, is only discovery amongst the children; pudgy and cute, Henley is appropriately inquisitive and awestruck. Keynes makes a decent pouting Edmund, while Popplewell and Moseley mostly inhabit space. The beavers, supplied with Irish/Cockney accents, were annoying.Disney spent $150 on this picture, both in marketing and production, and I'd guess the bulk of the cash goes toward that final battle between the Witch's army and Peter`s small band of Centaurs and cheetahs; it's fine, but it employs the same bit of medieval strategy that we've seen 30 times in the last ten years. At least it's not gratuitous or gory; viewers complaining that the blood/beheading/money shots have been removed are obviously adults too selfish to understand kids have never required such carnage to get the point that somebody's dying."	3.0	Respectable.

Please do not watch this if you like the phantasy genre as this is like watching Lord of the Rings with only Hobit action. The four children from the cast do give things a try, but the lines that they are to pronounce are deeply annoying and very likely from another century. Especially the youngest girl truly got on my nerves! This is probably the clearest resemblence with Lord of the Rings as Frodo and Sam had lots of these tear jerking lines as well.

Narnia has been hyped as a great Christian story for decades and I can't figure out what this story has to do with Christianity. A lion is supposed to symbolize God and then the resurrection? The good folks run around as half human and half horses; a young guy (Mr. Thomas) in his early twenties runs around topless as he is half human and the other lower part of his body is half animal (horse or whatever), and he's one of the good guys luring young Lucy -- a 7-year old or so -- into his home to offer her tea and then drug her to admit to her that against his will he must kidnap her ... C'mon.Then there are creatures and violence just like in the Lord of the Rings and young children should not watch this film as it should be better rated PG-13. By the way, my 12-year old son liked the movie ... not that he was extremely excited about it, but it was okay.Yes it's the fight between good and evil, and at its time when the story was first published some 50+ years ago, after the second world war it may have been something interesting for people to read because of the then lack of stories available and as it was the dawn of fantasy novels and so forth, but today? If you're a Christian don't think that you will watch any sort of Christian theme or story here other than that C.S. Lewis was a respected Christian and theologian, but you won't find much of it in this flick.

Yes, there were tweaks and changes, but, and this is hard for me to say as a reader as well as a film buff, one has to give up purity when you're taking a story from one media and adapting it to the strengths of another.  Also, when a trait from the story is hyped to the point of hysteria (namely references to Christendom), the end product can make a person scratch their heads in wonder what all the fuss was about.  In short, just like ""The Lord of the Ring,"" it's a miracle if the movie adaptation actually lives up to both the press and its source material.Live up to it it did.  Disney's co-production is a splendor to behold.  Excellent storytelling, fabulous cinematography, talented casting, and marvellous special effects team up to do the necessary job in bringing this great book to life.  Not an easy thing, especially when you see the BBC television adaptation and the good job THEY did with less than a tenth of this budget.  Purists (I am one) will pick at this or that.  Christian entertainment observers will harp on one lack of Christ-mentioning or another.  No matter - this is THE version of the book that will last forever (even though I hope the BBC's magnificent series will rate up there with it).Now, we get to my pet peeve - extended editions with every film.As a filmie, I say the more stuff, the better.  I love to see the details of a movie's creation.  Moreso when I adore the movie.  The two-disc original release did a good (not great) job covering how the movie was made which hinted rather darkly that Disney was going to follow ""The Lord of the Rings"" in this troubling new trend of putting out a new ""director's extended version"" every time there is yet another scrap of new footage found and used as a retooling excuse.  Hence, this.  I bought it (like a cheap hooker, I criticize the trend while engaging in propagating it) and liked the new stuff included in the battle sequences, but it beggers the question; did we NEED a whole new release for it?  I enjoyed the movie euqally without it, and while Disney made a value-added addition of extra making-of and historical materials, I can't seem to justify this extra spending.  Even WITH the rebate offer!Soooo...if you haven't bought it, buy this version, even with the differences, it's still the same great movie.  If you have it already, well, the decision is yours.  I certainly wouldn't have if it didn't give us all this extras goodness, and still feel somewhat....used...now that I bought into the temptation."	4.0	A Good Adaptation, But Why The Extension?	2006-12-18	18	17	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1C58YXM2A30CY	"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re..."	"The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.Four children with just their mother in an English town, dodging Nazi bombs, are being sent out to the country for their own safety.  The director starts the movie strong with bombs bursting in air, with one of the kids (Edmond) saving a picture of his father as the bombs are dropping.Their eldest brother Peter takes being the oldest seriously but he is very harsh on his brother Ed as are his two sisters.  Susan is the serious, brainy one.  And little Lucy is the brightest one.With this tense family backdrop, I could relate.  One brother wanting to lead but not willing to take control; a brainy, serious sister lacking imagination; a willful, argumentative brother who takes personal advantage of things despite its consequences; and little Lucy, who is bright with imagination and energy in the face of losing her mother and all four moving in with ""The Professor.""The bombing scene was a bit fake to me, all CGI.  And the relation with the father is not totally explained.  The family situation with the professor and who he is was unsatisfactorily explained to the viewer (me) as well.  So the beginning gets off the a stuttered start.During a game of hide & seek as they are bored to death in a large house where they're not allowed to run or play (i.e., be kids), Lucy runs into a large wardrobe and off we go.The story moves at a steady pace, has the typical, light Disney magic.  It also has its dark side: betrayal, death, greed, and the use of power to further their own ends.The White Witch is an interesting sort.  Not sure how she became the queen or why winter fell upon Narnia.  Or even why Christmas had not been celebrated there for 100 years.  She brought new meaning to the term ""ice princess"" in my eyes!The film is visually stunning.  The mountains, the griffins and satyrs, the mermaids and lofty towers of castles.  And the dark & stark white prisons, Aslan's death by assassination -- these are all pretty strong for children and thus the PG rating.Too much is not explained to my satisfaction at the start, more of a background history of some of the characters, why they're acting as they are, what their relationships are, are skimmed over.However, the great acting by Georgie Henley, William Moseley, Skandar Keynes and Anna Popplewell as the four English children (my, those accents!) lift the movie to be more than the sum of its parts.Recommended, not only for an exploration into the mind of C.S. Lewis and his brand of fantasy novels but also for the exploration of family and friend relationships, honor and majesty.The DVD is cool as well with fascinating facts (JRR Tolkien & C.S. Lewis were contemporaries and often checked each others' work), some bloopers, and two sets of commentaries by the stars and by the director.  It was also fun to see that Industrial Light and Magic in the San Francisco area had a part in the production of this film.  To see the credits, New Zealand, England, Czech Republic, man these guys have been all over!  But I digress.I well-made piece of entertainment.Can't wait to explore the next film, Prince Caspian, as well as a heightened interest in C.S.

Most importantly, the true message of the story really comes through. I was pleasantly surprised that they didn't water that part down at all.

ReUnited the child live carefree as royalty for many years until they come across familar ground and find the wardrobe cabinet making their way back into their world (back as the childern they were when they entered).I'm sure much like Lord of the Rings, much has to be removed to keep the movie in a managable time frame, but unlike the ending to the LOTR trilogy they did seem to finish Narnia very well.In LOTR the hobbits return to the shire to find the evil wizard and they defeat him - this is SUCH a important piece of the story *showing the strength and courage of friends* and is left out - by the director).If you enjoy the Wizard of Oz - I would highly recommend Narnia as a must have for anyone's collection.  An instant Family Classic, one to be enjoyed over and over again.	5.0	Amazing . . .	2007-12-22	6	0	6

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ	Sean Pasek	"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a good film.  The special effects are first rate.  If only they were enough to truly satisfy the viewer, but they aren't.C.S. Lewis's beloved classic novel is given a pretty good justice with this film.  The cast of characters is well thought out...everyone from Lucy to Edmund, Susan, and Peter.  Even the White Witch is casted nicely.So, what is the problem you ask?  There simply isn't enough to really get at the heart and spirit of this story.  The characterizations surrounding the four children is good.  But, the novel focuses just as much on Aslan and the Witch.What happens is that even at 2 hours and 15 minutes, the movie's pace is too fast.  It flies through the story at a break-neck speed that it was never intended to do.  Thus, as it occurs whenever a film-maker ""rushes"" through a film, key elements are left out.  Not enough time is given to Aslan to really be in awe of this character, one of the most memorable in literary history.  Some key scenes from the novel are either rushed or deleted altogether.  We just aren't given that sense of magic about Narnia, that mystical quality that is so a part of Lewis's books.  His literary style captivates the reader, even though it is written simply, you still feel as if you've stepped through a Wardrobe into a magical kingdom.Unfortunately, the same argument can be said of the White Witch.  Especially in regard to her relationship and treatment of Edmund.  Edmund is a brooding, moody character who is only interested in himself.  That spark of potential cruelty is barely felt in the film.  Until he realizes what he's done, and how the White Witch forces him to pull her sleigh over the rough terrain after the snow has melted, do we get an idea of the true evilness of the Witch.  She is cruel and tempermental.  The deleted scene of the Queen turning a bunch of woodland creatures, who are having a tea party, into stone was left out.  And while we get glimpses of this in the film, it doesn't sink in far enough.The scope of the film is very good.  Wherever it was filmed, you get a sense of the beauty of Narnia that readers have come to expect.  The scenery is incredible and a feast for the eyes.  The way they've brought all of these incredible creatures to life is also magical.As good as this film was, it could have been so much better.  Granted it is geared toward a younger audience, and I think the young kids will be overjoyed with it.  However, I still think they could have gone a little deeper with it.  Just because a film is geared toward younger kids, doesn't mean you have to play ""down"" to them.  Examples such as the Harry Potter films, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and many others have shown the kids can handle more than you think and are just as interested in compelling story-telling as the rest of us.I know they are working on Prince Caspian, and I hope they can do more justice to that great novel than they did to this one."	3.0	This Entry is Good...But Not What It Could Have Been	2006-07-25	6	4	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A5HLL0SH72UYR	"Seth H. Torok ""gaum"""	"honestly, this movie was just awful.  I was pretty pysched to see it, in fact i went to the midnight showing.  The acting was awful, the special effects were horrendous (it was like watching the scene in King Kong when Adrian Brody is running under the dinosaurs, except for every shot).  there were obvious blue/green screens that totally took me out of Narnia. The Ice Witch was played by Tilda Swinton, the same actress that played a man and a women in 1993's Orlando, so with that in the back of my head she was real annoying.  The final battle scene was so terrible i felt like i was watching a remake of King Arthur (which until Narnia had the worst battle scenes in movie history). I no its Disney, but that is the point.  This film should have been done by a company who wouldnt ruin the film with campy acting and conservative battles.It's a travesty that people consider this the ""new Lord of the Rings"" because it is as close to Lord of the Rings as Blair Witch 2 is to Citizen Kane.  Of Course there are fantasy creatures and things of that sort, but please this movie is in no way similar to Lord of the Rings.  I recommend that no one buys this and hope you wait for it to come to television.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2LU658URZLQ6B	Shadow Rose	"Being a long-time fan of the beloved Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis I was fearful of getting my hopes up too high with this big-budget motion picture of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" but was ultimately pleased with how well it turned out and am not the least bit disappointed.From the wintery wonderland to the budding of Spring, director Andrew Adamson, on his first live-action project, brought Narnia to life better than I ever could have envisioned it with enchanting sets, stunning cinematography and a magical yet subtle score; meeting my every expectation.There of course were some understandable changes made to help the length and flow of the movie, as well as to add a bit more suspense to the already wonderful storyline, but all the important details remained, staying pretty much true to the book. I even felt that the film improved upon it because, as is the case in most children's, or even young adult books for that matter, there's never enough plot or character development (C.S. Lewis, respectively, left much to the imagination), but here they do.The CGI is admittedly noticeable in spots (the fox, for instance, didn't look very real to me) but they obviously took great care to detail on Aslan and it definitely shows! They also chose a wonderful cast--my favorite performances being Mr. Tumnus the faun, Jadis the White Witch, and the Pevensie children (albeit some of Lucy's crying did sound a little forced)--and I'm personally grateful they chose relatively unknown actors.As a side note, I'm greatly annoyed with all these comparisons to the Lord Of The Ring's and Harry Potter. In my eyes the only thing they each have in common is the fact that they all fall under the fantasy genre. Otherwise they're completely different films. And you honestly don't have to be religious to enjoy this movie. I myself am an athiest and relished every moment of this film... Interpret it whichever way you'd like for that was how it was intended to be viewed by the author himself! Also, there's only one epic battle scene and it contains no blood [hence the PG rating], so if violence is all you look for in a movie, this isn't for you! It's simply good old-fashioned storytelling that's destined to become a classic like the book."	5.0	Only Aslan can save you if you fall under the spell of the White Witch	2005-12-24	5	4	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3PIJJ4J2DDI6Q	"Shawn M. Warswick ""High School History Teacher"""	Disney's adaptation of the C.S. Lewis classic does a comendable job bring the world of Narnia to life. The special effects laden world gets the flavor of the books just right and really made me feel transported to that magical world on the other side of the wardrobe.While the film isn't a literal translation of the novel (I think it wouldn't have worked if it had been) it is more than that.  I really feel this film is able to stand on it's own and is worth the price of the DVD.The film tells the story of four children from London who are sent into the English countryside during the bombing of World War II (something which was quite common during the war was to send children into the countryside).  It is at the house in which they are staying where they discover the magical wardrobe which transports them to the land of Narnia.  In Narnia they become involved in the politics/war of the White Witch against Aslan.While the story is certainly a Christian allegory, the director handles it in such a way at to not knock you over the head with it.  He does a great job of not allowing the story to bog down (which can happen when adapting a novel to film).  The acting is good as is the cinematography and special effects.One thing I am tired of seeing/hearing is the comparision to the Harry Potter series.  To do so does a diservice not only to the Naria film, but to C.S. Lewis, a devout Christian.  I don't think you could say the same for the creator of Harry Potter, and comparing the two is truly like comparing apples to oranges.This film, while not great on the same epic scale of the Lord of the Rings (a much more apt film to compare it to), it wasn't meant to be the epic which the LOTR was.  This film is a good one and I highly recommend it.	4.0	A good film	2006-02-17	19	13	6
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AJTGQW7PVZELZ	Shelley Godwin	"Since there's already an overabundance of comparisons between the Chronicles of Narnia and the Lord of the Rings I'll completely skip that prerequisite to any Chronicles of Narnia review and get to the point. The problem that I have with the Chronicles of Narnia isn't the oft commented on Christian allegory or even its sanitized battles; the problem is that Narnia is missing the charm that should be present in any fantasy movie.There was never at any point a time that I felt that Narnia was believable. Not because of the special effects, those were well done but because of a sense of trying too hard. It seems that so much time was spent on trying to get Narnia to look just right that no one bothered to make certain that the characters had any personalities or any driving force to make the viewer care about Narnia and its denizens. While the special effects were well done it goes without saying that special effects do not a movie make. The Neverending Story had sub par effects compared to what is present in Chronicles of Narnia but it had an impact that I felt was lacking from Chronicles of Narnia. I wanted Artreyu to succeed, I cried when Artax died in the Swamp of Sorrows. With the Chronicles of Narnia I couldn't care less what happened to the  Pevensies and only wanted Aslan's ""sacrifice"" scene to be over with so that we could get on with the movie.There was no character development for anyone, all four Pevensie children were nothing more than mere cardboard cut outs who conveyed more excitement during the air raid scene than they did upon finding that there was another world through an old wardrobe. Aslan was one dimensional as well. He emanated no sense of awe or reverence, as he seemingly wanders through the movie, more like an extra than an integral character to the plot and we're never given any reason why we should be on his side other than he's against the White Witch.Of course no modern fantasy movie is complete without an epic battle with the good guys being decidedly outnumbered. In this case however, there should have never even been a question about who was going to win. Not only were the Narnians outnumbered but they were being led by a person who had no battle experience, no leadership skills, no familiarity with the geography of Narnia, and no training. And yet the Narnians followed him. With such a naive citizenry I can see why it was so easy for the White Witch to take over.As a viewer I was completely apathetic to the events going on onscreen. I didn't care who won, who lost, if the Pevensies ever returned home again, or what happened to Narnia. It was impossible to because after nearly two hours I knew the same thing about them that I knew at the beginning. Nothing.Chronicles of Narnia isn't the worst movie that I've seen by far but it had the potential to be better than what it was. Throughout the showing I couldn't help but feel as if something was missing, did they take something out, is a character missing is there a scene that was edited?  The answer however is that while The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is no War and Peace, it was able to do in its one hundred odd pages what the film couldn't do in two hours; convince me that there truly was another world at the back of the wardrobe."	2.0	A Disappointing Journey	2006-01-18	20	6	14

Regardless of the bad publicity C.S. Lewis got it is the telling of the story as the animals see it. Aslan is the image of Jesus Christ who must sacrifice his own life to save the prophecy and Narnia from the evil of the White Witch.The children were delightful especially Georgie Henley who played the role of Lucy. There are many references in the film regarding to Biblical theology and the way C.S. Lewis wrote the story through the imaginary interpetation of the four Pevensie children, Lucy, Peter, Edmund, and Susan, the animals suffering under a hundred year bondage, Aslan the Messiah (Christ), and the evil White Witch (Satan).There is a word of caution to parents before letting children views certain scenes like the White Witch's castle, the sacrifice of Aslan (scary looking creatures), and the battle coulde be a little to much for very young children. But I've seen worse in others. Other than that I enjoyed the storyline and that all things came to a good ending when Narnia is restored to it rightful glory of freedom and peace in the land. I recommend this to those who like something a little different that tells it in a theological view, fantastic mythical beasts, talking animals, and great visual effects.	5.0	C.S.

This movie has it all; Excellent acting, story line, special effects, action and it is wholesome enough for little kids.ACTING-I don't see this often in a movie, but every actor in this movie did a superb job. Best in show would have to be a tie between the little girl who played Lucy and the woman who played the witch. Every facial expression and every line spoken was perfect. When the white witch was trying to seem nice, you felt that she was sweet. When she wasn't seeming so nice, you felt the villany in her heart. Lucy portrayed both the innocence and the naivity of a small child.STORY LINE-The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe has long been considered a literary classic, loved the world over because it is a suberbly written story about a group of four children who partake in an amazing adventure in the magical world of Narnia. In this world, every animal speaks and magic is everywhere. The world is in the icy grip of an all-powerful evil witch, and it is up to the children to set things right. The use of children as the main characters instantly captivates the imagination of every child watching, as they imagine themselves taking part in the adventure.SPECIAL EFFECTS-Due to fantastic advances in computer animation, the epic battles which take place in this movie are nothing short of amazing. Huge armies of monsters, including minotaurs, centaurs, satyrs, giants, gnomes, flying griffons and many types of animals clash in amazingly detailed environments. The sounds of battle fill the theatre, making the viewer feel as if they are right there.ACTION-This is an action packed movie. Better skip the large drink on this one, as you will not want to miss a minute of it going to the restroom.

It moves fast, has lots of action, but the FX are very...well...1981.So I heard about Chronicles of Narnia where a bunch a siblings find a way into another dimension, and thought, ""Perhaps this is a modern day Time Bandits for my kids.""There were some similarities:Narnia: Kids travel through magic porthole in wardrobe to Narnia.Time Bandits: Kid travels through magic porthole in wardrobe through space & time.Narnia: Good vs evil.Time Bandits: Good vs. evil.Narnia: A Witch and mystical creatures.Time Bandits: A Warlock and mystical creatures.Narnia: Good, of course, ultimately prevails.Time Bandits: Good, of course, ultimately prevails.You get the idea. The story is pretty much the same, but all the names have changed.Narnia is a long one too. One of my kids gave up completely and another was playing Gameboy and only ""1/2 watching"" at the 2 hour mark. Another thought ""it was okay"". I also thought it was just okay.Narnia is visually cool. The story is pretty easy to follow for kids without a parent having to do much, if any, PGing. But it should have been cut down by 30 or so minutes.So if Narnia was no thrill, I wonder if the kids would prefer Time Bandits with its 1981 special effects?

The characters were great (the Professor didn't look quite as I had pictured him), but everthing, and everyone was better than I expected.C. S. Lewis didn't spend a lot of time visually creating the landscape of Narnia, so its was great to see it as I had pictured Narnia myself. Lewis instead, painted with words, some very believeable characters, and when I read this as a child, I could see Narnia through the eyes of the Pevensie children. Just as I shadowed Nancy Drew in her detective work.The casting was great, and if as a child, I had picked a part for me, it would have to be Lucy: tender, innocent, and full of trust and love, this all comes through her beautifully.I really enjoyed the character of Father Christmas, and even though his bag was full of things, including a very charming teddybear, the gifts chosen for Peter, Susan and Lucy (Edmund missed out, by not being there), he stressed the gifts were tools, not toys. He was the ray of hope in an otherwise very dismal prospect. It's also intersting how Father Christmas and Aslan can be presented in the same movie. There is room for both at Christmastime: Hope, Love and Faith. What's really important, the idea is in no way conflicting: its just as a child would see it.Liam Neeson's voice was firm, but gentle and very well played. This is a credit to an actor who is playing not only The King of Beasts, but also the Son of God. I never did imagine the face of Mr. Neeson, standing by a microphone, and reading the lines, while watching Aslan speak. The blending of voice and strength was inseparable.Watching the scenes, I did miss the humorous narrative provided in the book, as if C. S. Lews was speaking parenthetically, or asides. I even watched for it when Lucy slightly closed the Wardrobe door, and in my head, I could hear the words he has written about for Lucy as she steps in among the fur coats: ""...leaving the door open, of course, because she knew it was very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe"". In the book, it's not like Lucy is really the one who is thinking but the 'person who is telling the story to us'.Absolutley, highly recommended. If you like battle scenes, and creatures, and special effects, you won't be disappointed. However, in keeping with the upbeat theme of the story, the battle to the death is not shrouded in greay shadow or moonlight, but in a bright blue sky day. Goodness does prevail.There are many books which have been, and will continue to capitalizing on the profitable story, such as guides to explain religious signifigance to children. I say, forget them. You child will be delighted with a story of adventure, suspense, and good triumphing over evil. Along the way, they'll pick up not to trust strangers (White Witch), or become a traitor in any sense: the Consequences are hard and real. They'll also pickup a little bit of sorrow for wrong-doing. I'd be slow to teach my children (now adults, but avid readers) the symbolism and it's relationship to the Bible before they went to see the movie. My approach would be to let them decide as they watch it, and unravel the wonder themselves. After that, watch for the teaching moments that will come when the child is telling the part they liked best, or asking questions. More is understood with every reading and when once the video is released, it will be watched again and again. Children are more receptive than most of us give them credit for. The lessons are there - and what a reward discovering and unraveling the puzzle on their own.A bit on the really positive side: Unlike past Classic Stories (Sword in the Stone, Cinderella, Peter Pan, et al), Disney has barely strayed from the storyline. There is no reason to even think of this as a story that needs any help by name-dropping.Certainly, if you haven't already done it, pick up a paperback, spend a few good hours, and brush up on Narnia by re-reading ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" before you go into the theater with any preconceived ideas. The movie is as subtle and wonderful as the books. Remember: Aslan is not a tame lion."	5.0	Absolutley Perfect - More Than Anticipated	2006-01-02	2	1	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3RZUI9G4OV6GT	Snubnosed in Alpha	"When I heard that Disney was doing a version of The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe I was concerned that the film might make a mockery of the treasure that is the Narnia series.  For one thing, the Disney of today is, in my opinion, a pale shadow of what it once was.  I mean, how could the company that produced, say, the enchantment of Snow White and Pinnochio, which left my five-year-old self in awe and wonder, also be responsible for the cynical and artistically inferior Emperor's New Groove?And when I learned that Andrew Adamson, the director of the admittedly funny, but often vulgar Shrek, was at the helm for Narnia, I feared that Mr. Tumnus would suffer from an acute case of flatulence.Then, too, there is evidence that Lewis himself would have had some reservations.  A newly discovered letter, allegedly written by Lewis just four years before his death, indicates that he opposed a film version of Narnia.  Assuming that the letter is not yet another Hooper Hoax, we have Lewis suggesting that television versions of his talking animals, from Fledge to Aslan Himself, would result in ""buffoonery or nightmare"".  And, he added, ""a human pantomine version of Aslan"" (picture a Narnian counterpart to Bert Lahr as the lion in The Wizard of Oz) would be ""blasphemy"".  The film thus seems to have run the risk of making Lewis turn over in his grave.But I stood in the churchyard at Headington Quarry last fall, and there were no signs that his rest was anything but peaceful.Nor need it be.The film positively honors the book and its author.  Indeed, asked whether Lewis would have approved of the film, Douglas Gresham, Lewis's stepson, replied, ""This would be beyond Jack's wildest dreams.""No doubt about it: Aslan is on the move.But for a few forgivable liberties (for example, the details of the children's and beavers' flight from the White Witch and her canine henchmen), the film is remarkably true to the book--right down to the dead bluebottle fly on the windowsill.  Like the recent film versions of Tolkien's Rings trilogy, the casting is remarkable.  If you have come to know the Pevensie children from reading and rereading the book, you might find yourself wondering how Gail Stevens, the casting director, managed to find the very Lucy who, until now, had lived only in your own mind.  And I find it remarkable that my Mr. Tumnus is the same faun that resided in Adamson's mind as he read the books as a child.Far from buffoonery or nightmare, the film crew's creation of some 23 different Narnian species, from minotaurs and minoboars to giants and dwarves to talking beavers, wolves and foxes, is astonishing and very believable.And then there is Aslan.I'm in over my head as I attempt to speak of the technology--some combination of a thing called animatronics along with computer imaging--that produced the Lord of the whole wood.  Adamson himself said, ""I really wanted the children not to think it was a puppet.""  Indeed.  This would have been blasphemous.  He added, ""I didnt want them to think for a moment it was just a prop, but to react as if it was right out of the zoo.""The director underestimates himself.  Aslan is not a tame lion, you see.  Neither the Aslan who emerges from the pages of the book nor the screen version of Narnia's King, who first appears from his splendid pavilion, is the sort of animal who might be kept in captivity.  Somehow, this computer-generated figure has weight: the very ground trembles as he walks.  And he is fierce: his deafening roar is the undoing of even the arrogant and powerful Jadis.  And he is wise: you can see that in his eyes.  And he is good.Aslan is very good.Indeed, perhaps the most remarkable thing about the film is that it manages to do something that makes the books themselves remarkable: it evokes a fierce allegiance to Aslan and all that he stands for.  Here I am, a man of nearly fifty, who prides himself at being rather tough-minded and analytical, falling in love with a character of fiction from a childrens story.  Like the Pevensie children, at the name of Aslan, something seems to jump inside of me.  Like the Cabby in The Magicians Nephew, ""I feel somehow, if I may make so free, as 'ow we've met before.""There is much talk these days of the Narnia series as a Christian allegory.  There is some basis for this assessment.  But Lewis himself  resisted such a characterization of the work.  The stories are much less an attempt to allegorize the gospels than they are designed to acquaint readers with the Deep Magic that underlies the gospel stories themselves.  As Lewis saw it, western societyperhaps British readers in particularhad become jaded and numb to the Christian themes of good and evil, redemption and self-sacrificial love.  But those themes themselves, removed from an overtly Christian context, are soul-stirring and transformational.  Removed from that context and seen afresh, with centuries of encrusted assumptions and biases stripped away, the reader is permitted to respond directly.  Lewis's aim was one in spirit with that of G.K. Chesterton who, in his own presentation of the gospel message, sought to ""reover the candour and wonder of the child,"" ""shake off the cloud of mere custom and see the thing as new, if only by seeing it as unnatural,"" and ""invoke the most wild and soaring sort of imagination; the imagination that can see what is there.""There isn't a child in the world who, having been drawn to Aslan, is not heartbroken over what transpires at the Stone Table--and elated over the events of the following morning.  And if our own world is ruled by a King Who would pay such a ransom to save us from our own treacheries, then we owe Him our undying devotion and allegiance.Perhaps the magic has returned to the Magic Kingdom after all.  But this is perhaps a magic deeper still.  Long live the true King!"	5.0	A Magic Deeper Still	2006-06-25	10	7	3

I was hesitant at first about taking my 6 year old daughter to this movie.  But the fight scenes are not as long as what the commercials seemed to make them out to be.  I covered her eyes during the murder of Aslan and at a few parts during the battle scenes.  When Aslan was being killed seemed to be the scariest part of the movie for children to me.  The creatures looked like animals that illustrators from years ago had drawn depicting scenes of hell.  The rest of the movie is just fine for most children.  However, I wouldn't let a preschool aged child watch this movie.I bought the DVD today to put in my daugter's Easter basket because she was asking me if we could buy the DVD.As a Christian myself, I was only made of aware of how the movie might have a Christian theme just weeks before seeing the movie.  A very moving scene for me was when Aslan was walking slowly up to the stone to be killed.

What really bothered me about this film was the casting. I thought Lucy and Edmund and Aslan did a passable job but the White Witch was overplayed and the 2 elder Pevensies were boring. Some of the reviewers here think that the children's acting was ""sincere and heartfelt"" but I truly did not see this. What I saw was a lot of ""indicating"" which is a theater term for ""fake acting.""The rivalry between Edmund and Peter was a bit overdone and there was too much physical tension between Susan and Peter for them to be siblings IMHO. Did anyone else pick up on this? As some others have mentioned this movie tries hard to be whimsical but the end result is somewhat self-conscious and strained. Albeit with a heart stopping battle scene. Something was missing for me.I think this would've been much easier to pull off had it been animated because the director could've concentrated more on the dialogue/relationships/pacing instead of trying to recreate the magic of Narnia using real props ... which can never compete with the mind's eye."	3.0	nice special effects but contrived acting	2006-02-06	0	0	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ	speed_on_wheelz	Four siblings (Lucy, Susan, Edmund and Peter) are sent to live with a family member in a huge mansion.  One day, the four children decide to play a game of hide and seek.  Lucy finds an old wardrobe upstairs and hides in it.  In the wardrobe there are big fluffy coats, but as Lucy steps further back, she fell into a whole other world.  She meets a faun named Mr. Tumnus.  He tells her this is the land called Narnia.  They go to his place and have tea.  After tea, Lucy goes back into the wardrobe and back into `their world'.  She stumbles out of the wardrobe and runs to tell the others what she saw.  Of course, the other three don't believe her and think she's making up a story.  Another day, Edmund stumbles in the world of Narnia.  He meets the White Witch, who gives him something to drink and Turkish Delight to eat.  After the witch leaves, Edmund sees Lucy.  Edmund apologizes to Lucy for not believing her.  Excited now, Lucy and Edmund go back in the wardrobe.  Now, when the other two tease her, at least Edmund would back her up.  But Edmund does a stupid thing.  When asked by Susan and Peter, Edmund denies it, acting as if he was just playing along.  Hurt, Lucy storms out.  One day while all four of them are playing ball, they accidentally break a window.  To avoid getting scolded, all four children run and hide inside the wardrobe.  They too stumble in Narnia.  There, they encounter all sorts of mythical creatures; talking beavers, talking wolves, and most importantly, the king of Narnia, Aslan, who's a lion himself.I read the book and now I watched the movie.  If the movie was based exactly on the book, this movie would be more than 2 hours.  I recommend The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to anyone who enjoyed the Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings books/movies.	5.0	brilliant...a masterpiece... i wish i could give this more than 5 stars	2006-06-23	4	1	3

With the exception of the little girl who plays Lucy, the kids are as interesting as oatmeal. They're just frightfully proper English children completely void of personality. The special effects are cheap. The director even cheats as far as Mr. Tumnus is concerned. He's a faun, so he ha a goat's legs. But he's filmed almost entirely from the waist up so they don't have to worry about how to show his legs. I didn't realize at first that the old dude was Santa Claus. He doesn't look anything like any of the popular portrayals of him. He looks more like the drunk uncle who embarrasses everyone during Thanksgiving dinner. The scenes that take place in the snowy wood were obviously shot indoors. It couldn't look more fake. The beavers were so annoying. And so poorly animated! The director did the Shrek movies but he can't draw a giant rat? Liam Neeson's voice simply did not work. It doesn't sound like it could come from a (badly computer generated) lion. And poor Tilda Swinton, stuck wearing that silly piece of plastic ice on her head. It looks like something you'd have to wear at a party because of some fraternity prank. Her performance is the only good thing in the movie. She's fierce and compelling and sexy.As far as the Christian angle, it's pointless to look for any deeper meanign, because it's so obvious and heavy-handed and simplified.	1.0	nearly walked out	2006-02-13	138	13	125

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AGMW3I34INNYG	Stephen Cannon	C.S. Lewis' beloved series of novels detailing the history of Narnia have been adapted for film before.  There was a lone TV version of The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe that starred Angela Lansbury.  After that, there was a set of three BBC TV films.  This latest version comes riding the wave of Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter mania, with the fantasy genre being a popular flavor in Hollywood today.  I personally loved the LOTR movie trilogy, which does have its similarities to Narnia. So why was this film so disappointing to me?I came to the Narnia books, and fantasy novels in general, late.  I first read the complete series in its entirety two years ago, and was struck by the potential for a blockbuster series of films.  I could vividly imagine possibilities for what the grand castle of Cair Paravel, the lamppost in the snowy wood, or even Aslan the Lion might look like.  What director Andrew Adamson captures here seems to lack imagination, and more importantly, wonder.  While the quartet of child actors playing the Pevensee children are all well cast and perform admirably, as do Tilda Swinton as Jadis and Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan, there seems to be depth where depth is not needed, and no depth in places where it could improve the pacing.  While there are some convincing effects (the griffins, the wolves), some of the effects look primitive next to other films, including Aslan himself.  Director Adamson seems to have been stuck in his Shrek world, allowing the talking animals to appear out of the context of the world they inhabit.  In that regard, this film appears to be at times like a 21st century Bedknobs and Broomsticks, where its goal is to mingle animation and live action, albeit not always successfully.On DVD, an extended version would be most helpful.  At its heart, this first installment is fairly true to Lewis, but falls short for my hopes.  Suitable for older kids who are not overly sensitive to violence.

Its actors are competent, if not nearly as appealing as those of, say, ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks,"" ""Dragonslayer,"" and other Disney fare plumbing the same basic material.  Where it suffers is in its uneven storyline, from characters that are sometimes annoying in their inconsistency (the ""smart"" older sister seems pretty dumb and rather annoying all around, for instance) to a Christian allegorical framework that includes - and I'm not kidding - Santa Claus handing out deadly weapons to children.  In fact, I thought it a little disturbing in these trying times of religious extremism to see a film that on one hand purports to have spiritual overtones while at the same time advancing the notion that only through all-out bloodletting can that spiritualism be preserved.  (I'm not sure westerners wouldn't be decrying this idea if the religion were a different one.)  In the end, though, ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is good but not great entertainment.  The buildup to the climactic, technically well-conceived battle scene seems to take forever to reach, as the thinness of the plot - a group of displaced British children find a passageway to a secret frozen world through the back of a wardrobe - couldn't quite hold my attention.  Maybe I'm just overloaded on the Anglocentric stuff, or maybe I should read the book, as a friend tells me it's much better.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A303AOOHDU1VZ2	Stephen Smith	I had a few apprehensions about seeing this film. In the first place, I have not read the books. Allegorical stories tend to confuse me, and I was especially reluctant to undertake an allegorical movie without having prepared myself with some sort of road map. In the second place, having read a number of show biz biographies, I feel uncomfortable about movies featuring child actors, and especially child actors with British accents. And in the third place, I have grown so accustomed to computer-generated special effects that generally I find them as predictable as the magician pulling a rabbit out of his hat. I am happy to report that none of my apprehensions was justified. In the first place, the movie is not so much an allegory as a retelling of the story of the Messiah. There are oblique references to Christmas, Saint Peter, and the blood of the Eucharist, but I think Narnia can also be enjoyed by those who believe the Messiah is yet to come, and by anyone for whom this motif of sacrifice and redemption strikes an emotional chord.  In the second place, the children are very well-directed, and the characters they portray are so meaningfully delineated that the plot (and there is a lot of plot) always seems to just emerge as a consequence of their different personalities. In the third place, all the fawns and beasts and talking animals in Narnia are never presented as precious and remarkable. They simply exist, without any fanfare, and we can accept them on their own terms.  In this regard, however, I must disagree with the reviewer who okayed this movie for young children. The lion is very realistic, and when he quite literally lays down his life to save the worthless sinner Edmund, it is much more disturbing than anything in, say, Bambi or The Lion King. And you might not want your young child seeing what happens when the wolf pack catches up with the fox. Age seven is definitely the minimum viewing age. Actually, the story seems directed primarily at older teenagers, but it doesn't have any lasers or sex or explosions, so what are its chances?	5.0	In this movie there IS intelligent design	2005-12-23	9	6	3

But really decisons like this, should really be best to be left up to parents, since they know thier kids better, and they know what they can handle.Now including the end credits, the movie runs 2 hours and 22 minutes, and not 2 hours and 15 minutes like the disc of this movie says, and I might bet the tape says about the same thing. And how do you just like the title The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Andrew Adamson who co-directed the Shrek movies directed this movie. And will also direct the sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian that will be set for release in 2008, so this might be a good start for a good series, but we have to wait and see. When the movie begins, 4 kids  Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes),  and Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley), are sent from thier home to a professor's (Jim Broadbent) house, which he lives with housekeeper, that is sent to meet the kids, and warns them off the rules and not to disburb the professior. They play a game of hand and seek, and Lucy discovers a warobe, that on the other side takes her to the country of Narnia. And on her arrival she meets a faun, Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy). And she goes to his house with him, and joins him for tea, where they have a visit, along the way she manges to escape from the White Witch (Tilda Swinton). And she returns to the prefissor's home, where she notices her brothers and sister are still playing, and have not even noticed that she was missing. She tells them off her visit to the country, and of course they don't beleive her. But in time, she mangers to gets Edmund to the wardob, and gets him to follwo her into and into Naria, where he meets the witch, that he assumes is a queen, and she tells him that she wants to meet the rest of them. And really before you know it, all 4 kids ends up going into the warob, and in the country of Naria, where they have to get the help of the returning Lion King Aslan ( Liam Neeson), to defeat the witch, and return Narnia to its glory that it has lost.	4.0	Not for young kids	2006-06-20	2	1	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A36ER94271DHJZ	"stryper ""stryper"""	"**SPOILER ALERT (possible spoilers for both the movie and the book)**I, like every other lover of the, Chronicles of Narnia books, was very happy to find that someone had finally decided to do a big screen version of the second book in the Narnia series (as although it was the first book written, The Magicians Nephew is the official first book in the reading order, and rightly so, as it explains the origins of the white witch, and why the professor is not so fast to dismiss Lucy's claim of having visited Narnia).And when I finally saw the trailer, I was even more in anticipation of the films opening (although, I must confess that the battle sequences shown in the trailer, seemed to me to be bordering a tad too much, on the, Lord Of The Rings, CGI, battles, and I had a slight fear that the film was going to try and cash in on the, Lord Of The Rings craze).Then, with popcorn and drink in hand, I settled down to what I though (hoped, more like it) was going to be a faithful telling of the great book (a book that like, Harry Potter wasn't just written for kids, but also for the kid inside, and thusly, could be equally enjoyed by both young and old alike).Oh sure, I was expecting the odd embellishments here and there, as movies always do, when sourced from a novel, but what they did, went WAY beyond the odd embellishments.Whole lines of amazing dialog, from the book, had been replaced with longer, but crappier lines, whole scenes changed, for no obviously good reason, and the worst part, is that, except for Lucy, all of the other children came off as whiners, who would spend their time in Narnia, wanting to go home and leave the fighting to the poor Narnians.In the book there is one instance where Susanne mentions that maybe they should go home, but when Lucy points out that they have to rescue the fawn who helped her, as it's her fault that he's been taken away, then from that moment on, all are intent on seeing it through to the end.But in the movie, it seems every other moment, Peter and Susanne are all for leaving the Narnians to there fate (""this is not our fight"") and saving their own skins.The only reason that they end up staying, and even fighting, in the final battle, isn't because they suddenly feel for the plight of the Narnians, but because they have no other choice.So at the end, when they are crowned as king and queens of Narnia, it feels wrong (with the exception of Lucy, who stays true to her character in the book, through out the film).Because of the constant whining of Susanne and Peter, you never connect with them, as you do in the book, and thus, don't really care what happens to them in the film.If you want to see a better telling of the story, then either the BBC mini-series or the animated TV special (which are both available on DVD) are much better.Oh sure, the BBC version tends to drag slightly in spots, and the special effects were done on a shoestring budget, but that is quickly forgotten, as the story unfolds, and you get swept up into the magical world of Narnia.The acting is much better (especially in the case of the White Witch, who is played with over the top glee, by the actress portraying her, as is the way she is portrayed in the book) and the writers and director, having realized that the book was so well written, that no liberties were needed to be taken, do a much better job of bringing the story to life.Also, the fawn in the BBC production is much more suited to the part, coming across as older and wiser, where as the younger fawn in the movie, just doesn't play as true to the character in the book.All in all, I'd have to say that I was very disappointed with the movie, and advise anyone watching it to either rent or buy, the BBC production, and watch, The Chronicles of Narnia, as they where intended to be seen."	2.0	THE TRASHING OF A CLASSIC	2006-03-22	32	13	19
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A6R8XUE6MJLMC	Stuart Winer	I did enjoy this movie. They missed their goal of duplicating Jackson's LOTR franchise but there just wasn't as much story or charming foibles to build out here. They really missed an opportunity playing it so safe, but this was still a very good film. The CGI animation is so good now it's almost undetectable and the battles were terrific.For the theology: (Big Suprise) - Aslan represents Jesus. The Snow Queeen represents Satan and ruled the natural world through manipulation of her subjects' dark impulses of fear and envy and the satiation of base needs, i.e. addiction to pleasure in the form of Turkish Delight candy - not sex or money, it's a children's story. Her palace is a frozen and lonely place.Allied against them are God's army, brought together by the animals' more noble qualities. Aslan(Jesus) rules through wisdom and mutual love and respect for his subjects, appealing to their highest potential. And Man, the sons and daughters of Eve, represent the natural kings of nature and God's Creation, masters of all the talking beasts and classical myth-monsters in Narnia.When the Ice Queen comes to the assembled army of Jesus(Aslan), and demands Edmund, as if he were a fallen, sinful human and that as the Old Testament says, an eye for an eye - Edmund had been corrupted - he had sold out his family, and now there was a price to pay.This is of course a theological passion play. In a real war she would have simply been captured and that would be the end of the conflict, but the physical battle here is secondary.Aslan willingly sacrifices himself to for Edmund in a scene of gothic horror among the Ice queen's monsterous circle.And so God saves humanity, giving his only (lion)Son to us, breaking the old-testament Covenant with the ancient Jews represented by the stone table and forming a new one based on the Love of God and his forgiveness of Edmund's - and by extension humanity's - Original Sin.  Only lion(Jesus) doesn't die - he is reborn, greater than ever.Hooray!..After a tremendous, powerful medieval battle the siblings, the True Kings and Queens of Narnia, valiantly win the day, the Snow Queen loses as Aslan pounces on her and Narnia is ruled with Peace and Justice .. until they realize they're siblings and don't have anyone to procreate with, and so they're goin' back to the Wardrobe just in time.Narnia is a beautiful place to visit. It doesn't have the humor or wit to be a true classic for adults, but it does leave an impression of warmth and wonderment and it captured the fleeting youth and innocence of the actors in a beautiful way. It also completely captivated the 5-12 year old crowd at the theatre, itself no small feat. It's certainly worth a matinee ticket price if you have the time.	4.0	Wonderful theo-metaphysical BS for the whole family.	2005-12-09	5	1	4

I would have loved for the movie to be longer than 2 1/2 hours long. But other than that I really enjoyed the movie. I think that the children did an excellent job of their roles. I also think that just because you have read the book does not mean that the movie will be exactly the same. I have read many books that were put into movies so I never expect the movie to be exactly like the book. I like to see the writers put a little something of themselves into the movies. Even if you have read the book or not the movie still pulls you in. And that is all that matters. I have bought this movie and my nieces and nephews loved it.

But if you, like me, have read and loved all things Narnian, then you might find that the movie version leaves you scratching your head and wondering, ""Why did they change it?  Why not simply create a movie plot that follows the book?""Unfortunately, I don't have a satisfactory answer to that question.  I can, however, share with you my way of getting past it.In my experience so far, every movie I have seen which was based on a book or play I have read and loved has fallen short of my expectations.  It was only recently (with the debut of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies) that I worked out how to enjoy the books AND the movies...1. Don't take the movie too seriously... It's just one fan's vision!2. No matter what takes place on the screen, it can't take the place of the book in your heart, right?3.

The movie is on the first one and many of the extras are on the second one.  I have to say the features on the second one were both fun and educational.  You can take a look at how all the major characters were made.  They give you a look into the CGI and they also show you where they used live animals.The insert guide helped, I tried to look for particular things and was confused until I glanced at it, easy to read and understand.This DVD set is well worth the $ for someone that is looking to watch this story more than once, and for anyone who wants to find out ""how they did that"".  Great spring purchase.Now my 2cents on the movie - it was fantastic.  For someone who hasn't read the books or seen any other versions in 25 years I was blown away by the movie.  There may have been parts that were missing as others have said but as a stand alone movie it was great.  Easy for someone who has not read the books to be caught up in the story.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AO0A6DBY64U6T	T. Dubord	"THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLDWith the movie release of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" on December 9th, based upon the Christian classics by the late Christian scholar and literary genius C.S. Lewis, the world will see one of the most fascinating stories made into film. What the average movie goer won't know is WHY Lewis wrote the original book: (1) to describe what God was like (via the character of Aslan, who is a picture of the ""Lion of Judah"" [Revelation 5:5] or Jesus Christ] and (2) to convey in illustrative form of the salvation story of Jesus--that Jesus Christ (Aslan) was willing to die in our place because we (like Edmund) were in bondage to sin (Turkish Delight) and evil (White Witch).Initiated by a dream that Lewis had at 16 years old, The Lion, Witch, and The Wardrobe built the cornerstone of a seven-book fantasy that has sold 90 million copies over 55 years, establishing itself as one of the most beloved works of Christian fiction of all time. This initial volume follows the journey of the four Pevensie siblings--Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter. Set in World War II England, the children enter the world of Narnia through a magical wardrobe while playing a game of 'hide-and-seek' in the rural country home of an elderly professor. Once there, the children discover a charming, peaceful land inhabited by talking beasts, dwarfs, fauns, centaurs and giants that has become a world cursed to eternal winter by the evil White Witch, Jadis.Under the guidance of a noble and mystical ruler, the lion Aslan, the children fight to overcome the White Witch's powerful hold over Narnia in a spectacular, climactic battle, with its central figure, Aslan, the victorious lion who represents Christ--the Lion of Judah, who dies and resurrects just as in the Gospels. Moreover, Aslan, like Christ, voluntarily steps in to take the punishment due to one of the 'sons of Adam'. The children, like the Disciples, are initially grief stricken by Aslan's death but then overjoyed by his return, and then join him to fight against the White Witch and her evil allies. (Of course, there are many other links between the book and the Christian faith.)A GREAT MOVIE THAT IS TRUE TO ITS ORIGINAL BOOK-AND ""THE BOOK""Well, Walden Media and Walt Disney Studios have now turned this novel of the Christian Gospel into a $150 million movie that will reintroduce ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" to a whole new generation of children and their parents in a ""Lord-of-the-Ring"" type movie format. And this initial Narnian theatrical adventure is expected to be followed in coming years with the following six-volumes being made into movies. (You can see an actual theatrical trailer of this first movie and see more about the making of the movie by going to [...]I must admit I was skeptical at first to have Disney partnering with Walden in making this movie; it is not like they are known for being a bastion of conservative Christianity! As Christianity Magazine (Oct 2005) conveyed,The film has been made by Walden Films, which has a good track record of creating family-friendly movies. The decision by Disney to partner with Walden and distribute this film was initially not welcomed by Christian culture watchers in the US who warned that Disney might want to water down the Christian symbolism. Disney have always denied this intent and [so included] the input of Douglas Gresham, the stepson of C.S. Lewis, who is a co-producer [and] has helped reassure wary Christians. ""I am a committed Christian and I am very happy with the script,"" Gresham confirmed.""Gresham, serving as co-producer, became the spiritual watchdog and conscience of the movie project, assuring that the movie version kept true and accurate to his stepfather's originals.As a Christian and Pastor, my concerns were further quenched when other national Christian leaders affirmed the value of the movie. ""We believe that God will speak the gospel of Jesus Christ through this film,' said Lon Allison, director of the Billy Graham Centre at Wheaton College in Illinois. Ted Haggard, President of the National Association of Evangelicals, also said that the film was an ideal way for a Christian message to be brought to people who would not otherwise go near a church. ""Here is yet another tool that many may find to be effective in communicating the message of Jesus to those who may not respond to other presentations,"" he said.MY PERSONAL RESPONSE TO THE MOVIE...WOW!Having personally seen the movie, I can tell you it is nothing short of almost EVERYTHING C.S. Lewis intended it to convey. I cannot encourage you enough to see this movie, then read one of the many books that explain how God and Jesus are explained via The Chronicles of Narnia (like ""Knowing Aslan"" or many other books one can get from Amazon.com-including ""The Bible""). I am so impressed by this movie (and the original book) that at our Christmas Eve Services (where I pastor at Lake Almanor Community Church in northern California), I will be using the movie to help me answer the question, ""What If There Were No Christmas?"" Before Aslan comes, Narnia is in perpetual winter without hope. Before Christ came, our world was lost in sin and without hope. In addition to our sanctuary's normal Christmas d&eacute;cor, the stage will be flocked with snow to represent a winter landscape, like Narnia, with a lamppost and a wardrobe, out of which people exit into the winter pines! As of Sunday, January 9th, I will also begin a Sunday Series through the Gospels, studying the life and nature of Jesus Christ. It will be titled, ""In The Lair Of The Lion Of Judah,"" and will take us through a chronological gallop of the Gospels. One can obtain the CD's of those messages or read more about Narnia at our Church web site: lacconline.org)FROM ATHEIST TO CHRISTIAN SCHOLAR: C.S. LEWIS' SPIRITUAL JOURNEYOne last thing to help you enjoy the movie. Remember that C.S. Lewis' (author of The Chronicles of Narnia) spiritual journey traveled from the extremes of an avowed and antagonistic atheist to a devoted defender and scholar of the Christian faith. His Christian journey can be read in his book, ""Surprised By Joy,"" and his rational defense of the Christian faith (which was originally given in a series of BBC radio programs during WW2) can be read in his book, ""Mere Christianity.""IN 1916...After Lewis's mother died of cancer when he was only eight years old (about 1908), his father sent him off to a boarding school. On October 12, 1916, Lewis penned his position in a letter to Arthur Greeves: ""I think that I believe in no religion. There is absolutely no proof for any of them, and from a philosophical standpoint Christianity is not even the best. All religions, i.e., all mythologies...are merely man's own invention-Christ as much as Loki. In every age the educated and thinking [people] have stood outside [religion].""IN 1929...Although an atheist until he was roughly 30 years of age, Lewis began investigating the claims of Christianity during the twenties. On December 21, 1929, Lewis-upon reading John Bunyan's Grace Abounding-wrote: ""I...am still finding more and more the element of truth in the old beliefs [that] I feel I cannot dismiss... There must be something in it; only what?"" In this pre-conversion period Lewis wrote: ""I felt as if I were a man of snow at long last beginning to melt."" As a result, in 1929 Lewis was converted to theism. He journaled of that experience: ""I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed; perhaps, that night the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England,"" but this conversion ""was only to Theism. I knew nothing about the Incarnation [or that Jesus was God in human flesh].""IN 1931...In 1931, influenced by his friend J.R.R. Tolkien (""Lord Of The Rings""), he became a Christian and a member of the Church of England. On September 28, 1931, at age thirty-two, Lewis was ""riding to the Whipsnade zoo in the sidecar of Warren's motorcycle. `When we set out I did not believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and when we reached the zoo I did.'"" According to 1 John 5:1 and 5, all those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God are ""born of God."" To Arthur Greeves on October 1, 1931, Lewis wrote: ""I have just passed from believing in God to definitely believing in Christ-in Christianity.""IN 1941-1944...Although he became an Anglican, he stated that he was influenced by his Roman Catholic friend Tolkien. He was very much interested in presenting a reasonable case for the truth of Christianity, which he did in a series of BBC radio broadcasts, which were developed into his work, ""Mere Christianity,"" in which he states the following: ""I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: `I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic-on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg-or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronising nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to."" [CS Lewis, Mere Christianity, Book 2, Chapter 3, The Shocking Alternative]IN 1950...It only took C.S. Lewis three months to write ""The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe,"" and he had only one critic, his close friend, JRR Tolkien, who hated it: ""It really won't do,"" he protested. ""Doesn't he know what he's talking about?"" (Perhaps the fact that he was still working on The Lord of the Rings after a decade while Lewis knocked off The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in less than three months had a little to do with it.)  Yet the Chronicles went on to sell over 85 million copies over the last 50 years!As the BBC news reported, ""There can also be few children's books that contain so much theology as the Narnia stories. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is about atonement and resurrection, divine self-sacrifice and redemption. That might sound a bit much for a children's story, and something for parents rather than their audience to pick up on. But not necessarily.""Lewis's idea was not to write an allegory for clever readers to decode, where Aslan represents Christ. Rather, Aslan is Christ, coming to the world of talking animals as a lion, just as he came to earth as a human. Lewis found children better at understanding this than adults.""He was not concerned with teaching children the Christian story in disguise, as he expected them to know it already. Rather he wanted them to feel it. As a child himself, he knew the story of the cross and resurrection of Jesus, and knew it was meant to be important, but he had never felt its importance. If he could retell it in terms of a fairy story, it might make sense to children and they might grasp the nobility, tragedy and power of it.""LISTEN AND LOOK FOR THE SPIRITUAL STORY BEHIND THE ILLUSTRATIVE ADVENTURE OF NARNIA...Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again. (ch. 8)""But what does it all mean?"" asked Susan when they were somewhat calmer. - ""It means,"" said Aslan, ""that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic, there is a magic deeper still which she did not know. Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of Time. But if she could have looked a little further back, into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned, she would have read there a different incantation. She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor's stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards."" (ch. 15 of ""The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe"")Bottom line, see the movie! Then read The Book (""The Bible"")."	5.0	"Senior Pastor Previews Movie: ""TRUE To C.S.

Very imaginitave interpretations of Lewis' story. The film perfectly complements the vision, scale and beauty of the book. I had to let go of some things that bugged me because they weren't the same as I had imagined for so long in my brain. And I think anyone that can do that will enjoy the film much more! Things that make an awesome book don't always translate well into film. Overall this film is great adventure!Specifically for the Extended Edition- I prefer it over the original length, because it adds a few nice details. I was a little annoyed that they only added 15 minutes! And they don't have any deleted scenes in the extras, even though in some of the production/ behind the scenes documentaries on the extras show glimpses of scenes in production that weren't in the film. One such scene showed everyone dancing in the hall of Cair Paravel, including actors dressed as dryads, the tree spirits. It looked beautiful, but they never mention it or show it anywhere else! I think it at least deserved a show as a deleted scene...The bonus feature documentary on the life of C.S. Lewis was very good! I was actually surprised! Anyone who likes the author or wants to know more about the creator of the Narnia books would like this bonus feature. It was very touching.The production documentaries tell the viewer a lot about the creative process, the locations, especially New Zealand, and lots of fascinating details. And I usually hate watching dvd ""the making of the film"" documentaries. You also learn about the film score, the experiences of the actors, inspirations for certain creative elements, and much more."	4.0	Narnia!	2007-03-22	4	4	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A8ZTPTLGC4755	Terry	The first book in the Chronicles of Narnia series, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe takes us to a magical land of talking beasts, enchanted forests, a mysterious but benevolent lion, and an evil witch who rules with an eternal winter.  It is up to four young people to stop her so Narnia can be freed of her tyranny.I absolutely loved this film and I think Adamson did a great job showcasing the magic of New Zealand.  The battle scenes are terrific, especially the sequence involving the griffons, which I thought was extremely original.  Thankfully, we don't see a lot of blood because of the Disney nature of the film but I can forgive them for that.I do have to admit that I don't think it's on the same level as the Lord of the Rings.  Unfortunately, any fantasy film made today will always be compared to Jackson's masterpiece.  Still, Narnia makes an admirable effort and should be considered a classic among the Disney features.	4.0	Unfair to compare it to Rings	2008-05-18	3	2	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A8BY9TZTKQU3J	The Fingers On My Keyboard	This is a film that's difficult to fault for its disarmingly (and, at the least, apparently) honest, well-meaning intention of being a creditable adaptation of C.S. Lewis's story. So, with no implication of irony or sarcasm, kudos, first of all, for a well-produced theatrical trailer that worked brilliantly at drumming up excitement for the project (aided by now famously riveting music that stirs up a sense of anticipation wonderfully).It's likely to have come as a surprise to readers that Lewis's spare and simple tale (albeit not without craft) had been adapted into a two-hour long movie, and that might have begged the question of how deftly the writers and director could stretch what bare material they had to work with. Fortunately, the script presents a more eventful version of the original story, and makes an effort at stronger characterisation that an onscreen adaptation would have entailed, saving the book's celluloid counterpart from feeling thin.The movie owes most of its accomplishment to an endearing cast. The four young protagonists are all sensitively portrayed in restrained and sincere performances that make them believable, human characters, and prevent them from tumbling into the awkwardness and tackiness of expression that greeted audiences in the first `Harry Potter' film. Dynamics are well observed within the group of four, with the discretion and pragmatism of the respectable older brother and sister (the admirable and sturdy William Moseley and Anna Popplewell), informed with experience and a notion of consequence, experiencing tension with the reckless abandon and unbridled curiosity - be it rash and seducible, or innocent and daring - of the younger two (energetic, fully invested performances from Skanda Keynes and Georgie Henley). Emotional responses are never gratuitous, and any manner of sadness, discord, fear or fascination that is demonstrated is never saccharine or affected. The youngest of the characters, Lucy, in particular, revives the pure and simple charm of the wide-eyed wonder of a child, and be it expressing concern for a beleaguered Mr. Tumnus, crying over a diminished Aslan, or toothily showing sheer joy over the world she discovers inside a magical wardrobe, she pacifies even the most adamant cynic and convinces him of, and shares with him, the enthrallment she seems to genuinely feel in finding Narnia. It isn't always so easily that one gets to relate to the delighted, and uncomplicated, notions of a child, and Georgie Henley thoroughly wins her audience over.It is with a mind to expanding on the relationships amongst these four siblings that the moviemakers have worked to create more material for the film's plot. Their attempts at beefing up these characters, primarily by staging a number of arguments that emphasise doubt in one another's choices, contradicting attitudes, misunderstandings and resultant hostility, impatience with one another's flaws, and the general unease of a war-torn family, work adequately, if predictably and harmlessly. What their disagreements ultimately seek to convey is the frequently faltering trust that the children have in each other, and while that's all well and good in trying to make their relationships more compelling, they don't necessarily stand for much in the end if they don't feel like they bear weight, even with the constant reminder that it's in knowing they can rely on each other that they can emerge from the imminent turmoil safely. This weakness in characterisation is, specifically, an inability to develop truly captivating, consequential disputes, thus one doesn't feel particularly scathed when, for example, Edmund betrays his siblings to gain favour with the White Witch. Conflicts then become like relatively uninhibitive rocks in the course of a river that vaguely make its journey more interesting.As far as Narnia is concerned, its inhabitants have been lovingly rendered for the screen. Tilda Swinton is all frosty malice and beguiling stare, and her Jadis flirts ever effortlessly and carelessly with the feelings of those she would have useful and servile, and ruthlessly and curtly dispenses with those who have outlived their value. Trust Swinton to prevent the falsely proclaimed Queen of Narnia from crumbling into campy caricature, and make her a figure of searing, heartless malevolence to hate and relish at the same time. James McAvoy makes the most of his appearance as Mr. Tumnus, determined for his supporting character to be a memorable one. The Beavers are, in a word, adorable, and it's easy to see that Ray Winstone and Dawn French had a squeal of a time voicing these two constantly, but affectionately, bickering, kind-hearted creatures. However, it's in Aslan the lion that we see the best of the computer work done for this film, for the truly majestic great cat is a minor marvel of nuance, not only in the naturalistic way he moves and appears, but the remarkably accurate expressions of sternness, despondency, anger, gladness, cautious contempt and even mildness, tempered with a heaviness of heart, that are achieved through the animation. What help the character along are Liam Neeson's warmly sonorous voiceover, and the cast which responds believably to an imaginary figure. While not likely to be the determinant that wins this movie an Oscar for visual effects the way Gollum did for `The Lord of the Rings', Aslan should still be this film's most treasured conception.The carefully recreated fantastical locales complete the realisation of Narnia. Jadis's icy fortress is a luminous menace, all icicle spires and eerily glowing frozen chambers. This reviewer was pleased with the vivid depiction of her courtyard of stone sculptures. The Beavers' hut below the dam is a cosy little abode. A little disappointing, perhaps, is Cair Paravel, which, while providing an inviting image that's a contrast to that of the White Witch's castle, looks like an oversized dollhouse with an even sunnier faade. Curiously, the place one finds most enchanting is the snowy wood the children enter once passing through the wardrobe, for that, more than any of the other imaginary destinations, effects an immensely strong sense of place and immerses you in the realm of Narnia with an almost palpable feeling of being wrapped in the winter sigh of whitened forestry, an embrace that's chilling yet welcoming and wonderful at the same time.But therein lies the movie's fundamental failing: Even with Narnia thoroughly realised, the film doesn't transport you the way a good fantasy movie should. In spite of its unusual settings, nothing feels particularly distinctive about this world, hence nothing draws you in or makes Narnia memorable onscreen. This is possibly due in part to the fact that it being populated with generic mythic figures like satyrs, minotaurs and giants, which aren't presented as anything more than the typical creatures of make-believe they're commonly thought of being, works better on the page than on the screen, where, again, demands for characterisation are greater. And it isn't just the tension that's churned up among the four children - just about everything in this movie doesn't feel consequential. Stakes don't feel significant, save for Edmund's rescue, and there isn't a sense of foreboding or dread in the lead-up to, what's supposed to be, the climactic battle. The final confrontation between two armies then feels little more than an entertaining set piece an audience expects of a fantasy epic (which, in itself, turns out to be a tentative, disappointing sequence that's hardly sweeping). At their worst, encounters and events end up being kiddie, and it's during these segments of the movie (which are fortunately few) that it feels like polished frivolity. Some of these silly moments (there's no other way to describe them) are also examples of plot developments that will not only baffle young children but intelligent, more mature moviegoers as well, simply because they're based on events in the book that wouldn't have, and haven't, translated well to the screen. The appearance of Father Christmas is especially uneasy. While readers will grin in familiarity, as with everything else, those who have this movie to introduce them to Narnia will think his arrival one of hardly shrouded convenience, the result of his part in the story where he suddenly emerges only to give the children their weapons for the ensuing battle. It then rests delicately on the shoulders of the actors to pull these moments off credibly, and sometimes the sheer honesty of their performances manages it, sometimes not.But back to the point of a world that feels quite unfulfilling, therein again lies the rub: It seems this movie will only be able to justify its introduction of this world by having sequels, for only then will audiences get to see more of Narnia and appreciate its expansiveness in knowing that there's more than what's been shown here. Only then, perhaps, will they see a real point to this movie being made and theirs getting to know this, truly, wondrous land through this film. This reviewer, at least, is ready to revisit Narnia at the movies - the final image of the four children tumbling out of the wardrobe bears an almost creepily resonant echo of the book's ending. It is with the hope that possible future instalments can consistently provide such a thrill of immersion, of transportation, with an equal measure of heart, that one looks forward to seeing more of the lion and his world beyond the wardrobe.	3.0	The Heart and the Transportive	2005-12-23	11	6	5
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1BJ8BS8RL4OC	TheGMan143	"IT'S A MUST-SEE.  A short review cannot do this excellent movie much justice... For anyone who has NOT read the original CS Lewis story: Four children are sent into the countryside, to the manse of a professor, escaping the dangers of war.  While there, they discover a magical wardrobe that allows them entry into the Land of Narnia, where they are swept up in the classic battle of good vs. evil, with great reward at the end.  The Land of Narnia is peopled by the best (and worst) of creatures from fairytales, mythology, and fantasy; that come together in a battle to free Narnia from tyranny, evil, and everlasting winter.  Five stars isn't enough to rate this movie in my opinion. Complementing the great tale spun by C.S. Lewis so many years ago, the movie has absolutely STUNNING scenes, effects, and CGI graphics, excellent acting talents, and a great soundtrack that complements the scenes perfectly.  It's sure to make the Land of Narnia almost a reality to lovers of fantasy and the CS Lewis novels, and will be captivating even to those who have had the misfortune to never experience the Narnia Chronicles books.The movie itself stays true to the book, with little (if any) ""creative license"" by the producers and directors to change it... a true testament to how well-written and timeless the original story is.  Some minor sequences and scenes in the novel are omitted, as with most movies created from book form... but the spirit of the CS Lewis novel is definitely captured in eye-popping detail.As an aside... the title of ""Narnia"" is a bit misleading to those unfamiliar with the original story.  The CS Lewis book this movie re-creates is part of a group of seven novels, titled ""The Chronicles Of Narnia"".  ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is the first of these seven books (also which I highly recommend you read).  The second book, originally titled ""Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia"", is supposedly being done as a movie, due out in 2008... with any luck, it will equal or surpass it's predecessor.  A small dream come true for me would be to see ALL the books redone into movies as well done as this one.You will NOT be disappointed."	5.0	Narnia: The movie did CS Lewis Proud	2007-01-06	4	3	1

Moreover, the movie simply parts with the book so much that it really changes what the author C.S. Lewis was attempting to communicate in my opinion.  It feels that the makers of the movie took pains to take out any religious influences in the book. If they did not like the book - why make the movie or at least why call it by the same name?  They want to make money off the name, while making it just another modern movie.If you can tolerate the 80's special effects - but really great acting - you may love the BBC movies.	1.0	Not true to the book for the most part - but better than Prince Caspian which has nothing to do with the book at all.	2014-04-25	0	0	0

I saw it once on the big screen, and then I bought the special edition DVD.  Although I thought some of the special features could have been better (there are lots of bells and whistles for children, but not much for adults), I still give this edition five stars.  What I appreciate most about the movie is that it respects its audience.  I can remember as a child feeling I was being pandered to with silly, fluffy, happy movies.  This is the kind of movie I would have loved as a child.I'm now 50 years old; my husband is 54.  We have both loved this movie all three times.  I don't know how, but somehow the director has completely captured the fullness of my imaginary life as a child.  I used to play with stuffed toys and plastic animals, making up mythical stories.  Watching THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, I was projected backwards into my child's mind and heart.  I hate sappy stories--they depress me.  But this movie is truly moving.  The last time I watched the movie, I promised myself I would not cry (as I had the last two times), but I did cry.  When Peter raises his sword and cries, ""For Narnia and for Aslan,"" I'm deeply moved.Of course if you're a book lover, you're going to love the books best.  But film is a different medium entirely.  When I think of how badly the Narnia books could have been botched by spoiled child actors and by softening the intensity of the action (read:  violence), I get down on my knees and thank the powers that be that didn't happen.  One of the best special features on this edition tells us how the director was chosen and what the director's vision was.  I really can't imagine how this film could have been better.Children in England during WWII were subjected to the worst horrors imaginable.  How natural it is for a child to escape the horror of modern war by imagining a battle fought with honor.  The story embodies all the archetypal imagery that is common in children's imaginings:  a magical healing potion, a swift arrow hitting its target, the destruction of evil, the triumph of good, the courage of a strong heart."	5.0	A Movie that Respects Its Audience	2006-05-01	2	1	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2IL4AJIXXXLEM	the smart guy	I fell in love with the chronicals of narnia when I was a young child.  This movie does the book no justice at all.  The computer animations are horrible and nothing near as good as the creatures on Peter Jackson's The Lord of the rings. The actors are terrible and given a terrible script to learn.  There is no warmth or love between the children making this movie very boring and annoying to watch. Aslan the lion is portrayed as a real wimp in this movie.  The costumes especially the white witch's costume look horrible. I'd say as bad as something from a cheap community play. I do not suggest you waste your money on this atrocious movie unless you are such a huge fan of the C.S. Lewis series and your children don't know any better. Maybe little kids would love this.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"The Pevensie Children; Peter (William Moseley), the oldest, Susan (Anna Popplewell), the oldest daughter, Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) are bundled out of wartime London, to keep them safe from the bombing, and sent to the country estate of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent). Bored and isolated in the large house with only a cranky housekeeper to keep them company, the children decide to play a game of Hide and Seek. Lucy finds a large wardrobe, in an empty room, and hides inside. Pushing through a number of furs, she finds that she has entered Narnia. She quickly meets Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy), a faun, who befriends her and takes her to his home. He can't go through with his plan of turning her over to the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and helps her get back. Soon, Lucy and Edmund are both in Narnia and they get separated. Edmund meets the White Witch and she promises him that he can rule the land as King. All he has to do is get his two sisters and his older brother to come into Narnia with him and lead them to the White Witch. All four children are soon in Narnia and learn they may have a deeper destiny.""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", directed by Andrew Adamson, is a delightful holiday film. Based on the first of a series of books by C.S. Lewis, the film captures the wonder of children, the danger of conflict and has a fairy tale quality throughout.Adamson, who co-wrote and co-directed both of the ""Shrek"" films, has created a very realistic fairy tale world. If you have read any of the classic fairy tales, you probably remember that they are quite a bit darker than the Disney films. ""Narnia"" starts in World War II London; the city being bombed by airplanes, people running to shelters. Quickly, we see concerned parents bundling their children off to homes in the country. All of this is based on fact and helps to establish the tone and time of the period. Of course, it helps that this world is gray and bleak and contrasts greatly with the world they will soon encounter. Because of this reality, we are more inclined to ""believe"" the world of Narnia can actually exist. All of this helps to establish the film as a fairy tale; the dark beginnings leading to a world of fantasy.Even better yet, there is real danger in the fantasy world. Upon entering Narnia, some of the children receive treats and tea, but their entire stay doesn't consist of eating candy. They quickly learn that Narnia has dangers, similar to the dangers in their real world, and they have to work together to help Narnia overcome the dark forces.The four children are all very good, but the story centers on the two youngest children. Little Lucy (Henley), the first to enter Narnia, proves to be sweet and trusting, so sweet and trusting that she can't understand why Tumnus would initially try and trick her. Because of her character, Tumnus agrees to help her get back to the wardrobe setting other events in motion. As though he is helping them with their destiny.Edmund (Keynes) is the other standout. Initially enticed by the White Witch's promises, he readily agrees to bring his siblings back because he feels like the middle child he is; he resents his older brother and feels his sisters are a nuisance. Turn them in to become king of Narnia? No problem. But when he begins to realize the White Witch will not live up to her promise, he realizes he has to help his brother and sisters. He has to become their ally, friend and brother. Edmund is the most complex of the children and the most interesting.Tilda Swinton is great as the White Witch. She is very even, but also very menacing and has some wicked costumes. When she initially meets Edmund, she seems like a kind aunt, but as the story progresses, we realize she is very evil and will stop at nothing to get what she wants. She accomplishes this through words and subtle actions instead of histrionics. The costume designers on this film sure had some fun. Her dresses are severe and uncomfortable looking and add immeasurably to her character. Only a wicked witch would wear similar clothing.With ""King Kong"" and now ""Narnia"" it is evident the state of CGI (Computer Generated Imagery or Animation) has advanced to a mind-boggling stage. Jackson's Kong was so realistic, I felt I was watching a human being. In ""Narnia"", Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), the Lion ruler of the good, is also extremely realistic; he slowly blinks, showing his age, his impatience with people, his tiredness. He walks slowly, his haunches moving in such a way that I felt I was watching a lion who could speak. There are a number of animals in the film who can speak and all appear realistic. It is really amazing how advanced this technique has become in a relatively short time period. But as they keep raising the bar, other filmmakers will have to meet these standards or their films will suffer as a result. If they can make an ape and a lion this believable, we better not be subjected to any other cheap-looking or unbelievable computer generated creations.As the story progresses, it becomes pretty clear events are leading to a big battle and the four children will be involved, with Peter leading the charge. You might naturally expect a battle of this type to be ""sanitized"" as it features children and Disney is releasing the film. I was surprised to see that it was very lifelike. People die, the children are in danger as they battle the enemy, and they are threatened by others. The film doesn't show a lot of blood, or swords slicing through bodies, but this isn't necessary to show a sense of menace. We see the beginning of an action, but the film avoids the gorier aspects. Kids in the audience can see that battle is scary and dangerous, without being subjected to the blood and gore other films would show. This may seem like a cop-out, but remember this is a family film, so it is a little odd that these types of scenes are included at all. As a fairy tale, they fit.I am familiar with author C.S. Lewis and the ""Chronicles of Narnia"", but have never read them. You may have heard that there are religious overtones throughout the book and the film. There may be, but I am not overly familiar with religious traditions and practices, so I didn't spot a lot of overt imagery or themes. The few I did recognize didn't bother me. My mother noticed many mother and it didn't seem to bother her. If you are not religious, it probably won't bother you either. You definitely should not stay away from ""Narnia"" because you may be weary of overt religious messages. The messages may be there, but they are integrated into the story well enough to not seem blatant and obtrusive.""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" is an extremely well-made film and a film suitable for the entire family."	4.0	Great Holiday Film for the Entire Family	2005-12-29	2	2	0

I was completely sucked into this world.  I felt like I was living the entire movie, moment to moment.  Despite knowing exactly what would happen, I jumped outta my chair, I got nervous, and I sobbed, which says a lot about the quality of the movie.  There's a lot more meat on this film than there ever was in the books.  The actors they got to play the Pevensie kids are AMAZING...I couldn't believe it.  Usually these child actors tend to irritate me, but I guess the whole story does rest on them, so it's essential to cast those parts correctly.  I had read reviews about the ""Christian overtones"" and how that may be offensive to people who aren't Christian; all I have to say about that is don't go into this movie looking to complain.

The reviewers who exclaim how faithful the movie is to the book either have a much higher tolerance for moviemaker's 'poetic license' than I do, or haven't read the book. From the children's meeting with the beavers to their meeting Aslan for the first time, there is only passing resemblance between what Lewis wrote and what appears on screen. The ice floe scene is, well -- what exactly is that? Having noted all that, though, the movie was still riveting to watch, visually stunning, and extremely well-acted by the child actors, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy. If you haven't read ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"", go and see the movie anyway and enjoy the heck out of it.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	ABLBRUT8DALNN	Todd Smith	I love when they take a favorite childhood story of mine and adapt it to the big screen. I am always a little weary when it's Disney thou. You never know what Disney is going to do with it, however in the case of The Lion, The Witch, & The Wardrobe, is a homerun. They didn't shorten this film into some hour and a half movie about love. They took their time and told the story as it was meant to be told. All the kids were new to the big screen and were terrific. It's a classic tale that is over 60 years old and it's as fresh and relevant today as it was then. Two big thumbs up for the first of the Narnia tales, personally I hope they make all seven of them into feature films!	4.0	The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078	2013-02-24	0	0	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3EJVZ5LCBP61X	"TOMMY C ELLIS ""Prison Rev."""	"First the basics.  Then the fun stuff.  Chronicles of Narnia is a modern day classic, that's sure to find its place among the greats--yes such as Lord of the Rings and Wizard of Oz!  We find four World War II children displaced from the London home, and whisked to the countryside.  Life goes from air raids to calm boredom.  Alas, it was not meant to be.  They discover a wardrobe with a back that is...well, another world.  Narnia.  And this strange kingdom needs them-these four, to save the world.If there is one word that describes the underlying motif of this production it is action.  There is, of course, the physical action.  Fight scenes aplenty, from the early bombings of London, to the great climatic battle.  Emotional action pervades the film-between the siblings there are cravings for attention, demands for respect, and above all the draw of familial love.  Then there is the ultimate ""action"" between the Lion and the Witch-action that is physical, emotional, and yes-spiritual!Which brings us to the fun part-many thanks to the secular fundamentalists, who have created such a fuss with their intimations about subliminal Christian messages in the Chronicle.  Some school districts are so religiously hypersensitive that they have banned the Chronicles from their reading lists.  Of course, such hysterical overreactions and anti-religious bias only create controversy, which creates media coverage, which creates free advertising.  Ironically, kids will end up seeing Chronicles as a rebellious reaction to their secular overseers.We Christians made an obscure, and somewhat obtuse Last Temptation of Christ into a minor hit, with our opposition.  Muslims turned the Satanic Verses and Salmon Rushdie into global phenomena.  Maybe these anti-religious zealots will turn an already popular Chronicles into a true sensation.  Thank you, dear secularist, for returning the many favors we've granted you."	5.0	Thank you secular fundamentalists for free controversy and advertising!	2005-12-31	3	3	0

While the acting is a little ""fake,"" I know that they will get better over time. My only complaint really is that the movie seemed rushed. Like the actors sometimes seemed to do their lines very fast. I'm not sure what it was, but something about the movie didn't sit right with me. I guess I was spoiled by the radio drama by Focus on the Family, which every Narnia fan should hear. While not as good as I was hoping, there are many pluses. The battle scenes are spectacular, and the resurrection scene, while semmingly rushed, is done very well. The opening is truly original and gives a good foundation for two of the four main characters. The humor in the film, even the added dialogue to add more humor, is great. Take the kids and go out and see classical story telling."	5.0	Pretty good. 4.5 stars	2006-01-05	4	2	2
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1N3BYJXYY6EXL	"Tonz82 ""Tonz82"""	First i would just like to address the many people who have kept saying that the movie is too much like LOTR and the Harry Potter series (both of which I'm fans of and read the books before seeing the movies). Just to be fair, the book which Narnia is based on came out long before the Harry Potter series. As far as the similarities between the LOTR its no secret that Tolkien and Lewis were good friends. The two even belonged to the same book writer's club. Ideas were bound to have been bounced one off the other. I'm aware of the fact that one of the main disliked similarities between the two was the 'epic-ness' of the climatic battle scene. In the book no details are given about what took place during it, though Lewis does convey a sense of 'bloodiness' to this battle (the degree of bloodiness shown is another matter). Edmund and others are severely wounded. So a battle did go down. The movie simply fills in this hole and besides how boring would the movie have been to skip through such a visual segment. As a child I pictured the clashing of swords and creatures fighting in armor. For me the movie's battle scene wasn't that farfetched...Well, everything but the speed at which Peter mastered swordplay (certainly not as a comical as Lucy and her little dagger). Though in the book it does say Peter and the witch were going at it hard. So I assume that would mean matching one another blow for blow. Also, his knowledge of war strategy seems very instant. In the book, Aslan instructed him on what to do prior to battle. It would have been nice for this to have been mentioned in the movie.Second, addressing you adults who thought the movie childish and 'too nice.' Its a CHILDREN'S MOVIE based on aCHILDREN'S BOOK!! Now, why is that so hard for you adults to wrap your minds around? The Narnia book series was not written full of complexity or detail as say LOTR (a book geared more for adults, hello, are you guys grasping the concept now? Pphf, probably not for you more dense ones). Once again these books were written for CHILDREN. Now addressing, the lack of gore and bloody entrails, children are not 'little adults.' And so the matter of violence and death is handled with more subtley so not to be too overwhelming, yet still get the idea across. Some might say the lack of blood could be called the 'sanitizing' of death. However, I think we should give children more credit. When Simba's father was trampled by the wildebeast and Bambi's mother shot dead I think everyone got the idea. The same is with Narnia: Aslan getting stabbed with a knife and the witch proclaiming the lion dead. I think kids got the message without the spraying of blood.Get over it!That said I'll move on to the performances. The children did a good job I think considering that none of them had ever starred in a movie before. The kids in the Harry Potter movies were once in the same position and have blossomed I think. I think given time and should the Narnia series continue to be made into movies the same could be expected of the Narnia child actors. I thought Liam Neeson did a great job as the voice of Aslan. Very emotional and regal. I loved the look of the white witch and the performance of the actress that played her. By not over playing the role I think she made it much more believable and effective.The CGI effects were okay in parts and great in others. Though the same could be said in LOTR. Now admittedly, I think the CGI effects better in LOTR but CGI is tricky. And anyway the overall movie should be based on the telling of its story and the power of the message. Well, in my opinion anyway. We are living THINKING creatures afterall, not amoebas.To those rigid, rear clenching individuals who call themselves purists and TRUE FANS of the Narnia series:  Of course the book was better than the movie. Books in my experience usually are. However, I am able to be reasonable and realistic. Written and visual media are two different things. If you can't distinguish between the two then you should'nt have watched the Narnia movie in the first place. I had no problem with the slight changes in the movie. Overall, I think the screenplay remained pretty true to the book. I still walked away feeling entertained and having enjoyed a similar version of the book I loved and read as a child.Hey, this was a good movie. Certainly good for its worth.	4.0	What is wrong with you people? I'm talking to you Adults.	2006-04-15	13	10	3

She smiled too much. Apart from her hair being the wrong colour, the witch needs to be tall and thin. The main characteristics of her personality are cold authority and economy. Although she conveys hatred, she never speaks unless necessary.Apart from that, the final battle scene looked to me more like a stupid fight scene from a Lord of the Rings movie.	2.0	Soylent Dick Says: Another Great Story Ruined by Disney	2011-09-11	5	2	3

When all four Pevensie children end up through the wardrobe, they discover that it was meant to be, as two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam must join with the mighty lion, Aslan to defeat the evil White Witch.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A55TEBW8H4PYN	Trevor R. Raichura	Sadly, I was not one of the millions of children who read this series of books as children and were mesmerized by C.S. Lewis' captivating descriptions of a world outside of our own. On the other hand, fortunately I read this series at a time when I could appreciate them in a greater way than I could have if I had read them as a youngster.The movie adaptation of this classic brings vivid life to the novel! While there were a few changes to adapt it to the screen, it is mostly faithful to the words that C.S. Lewis wrote down some 50+ years ago. Thanks in large part to computer-assisted design, characters like Tumnus and Beaver looked very realistic and conformed to the images I already had in mind when I read the book. While not every character had a lot of flare, I believe Lucy and Edmund were brilliantly casted! The dynamics between Beaver and his wife were wonderful, and even minor characters (like Jadis' midget servant) were great!Comparisons between this film and Lord of the Rings are inevitable, but unfair in my opinion. Yes they are both fantasies, both filmed in New Zealand, and originally written around the same time period by two men who were close friends. However, the authors' intentions in releasing the books were completely different. C.S. Lewis wrote his works to be allegories, and to present the gospel message to kids whose parents would otherwise forbid them to hear the stories. Tolkien (author of Lord of the Rings) was also a Christian, but did not have any hidden agenda in his works. The intended audiences that the authors had in mind were also different - Lewis definitely aimed his stories at children, whereas Tolkien included far too many details to keep most young people enthralled. I believe this difference in intended audience accounts for some of the negative reviews that this movie has received. Ask most children under age 10 which movie they liked better, and I'm quite sure you'll see that Narnia is preferred.This DVD has minimal special features, so I recommend the special collectors' edition if you want featurettes and other bonus material. For the movie itself, this one gets 5 stars!	5.0	Brilliant! High replay value!	2006-07-09	2	1	1

It had great special effects, and you could tell that effort was put into producing it and hiring good, efficient actors and actresses.  As I recall, it was a lot like the novel.  And they hired the perfect person as the witch (creepy!)  I thought the four young kid actors were outstanding.  They did a great job!!  I am looking forward to seeing them in more movies, and I've also heard that another Chronicles of Narnia book (Prince Caspian) will be made into a movie in Christmas of 2007.  I hope it will.  It would be kind of silly not to make another ""Narnia"" movie, since this one did so well.  I've heard that it made over $638 million dollars....WOW!  I even think it out-did Harry Potter, which is definitely quite an accomplishment.This was the first movie I'd actually heard people clap for after watching it.  It left you with a good feeling.One thing I'd like to point out in particular...It is probably a little frightening for younger viewers.  I believe the movie was rated ""PG"" so that they would get a wider variety of audience, like really young kids (three and four year olds.)  Parents, if your very young child hasn't seen this movie in theaters, but you're thinking of renting this movie, don't.  Wait until they are a few years older, because this movie will probably give very young kids nightmares and make them afraid.  I don't think it would bother MOST seven and eight year olds, though.  The MPAA should have rated this film PG-13, but not as many people might have gone to see it.The plot is good, and it kept you enthralled in the story until the very end.  This is a movie that will appeal to anybody, Christians and non-Christians alike.  For Christians, this movie has strong spiritual parallels from the gospels, as is evident through Aslan.  For non-Christians, it's a fantasy/adventure film to enjoy, and even though it does have spiritual parallels, it won't feel like you're getting the Bible shoved down your throat.If you haven't seen this movie yet and aren't a really young child, I encourage you to see this movie either in dollar theaters or rent it out from the movie rental store.  (For some places, it might still be in theaters.)  It's a good movie."	5.0	Probably my favorite movie ever!	2006-02-20	3	2	1

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"Without the spectacular commercial and critical success of `Lord of the Rings,' no one would have given a green light to the production of the faithful adaptation of `The Chronicles of Narnia.' In that sense, the first film made out of the seven books of C S Lewis cannot be seen without being compared with the Peter Jackson's trilogy. In short, is `Narnia' is as good as that?My answer is `almost.' Disney et al. made a decent fantasy film out of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" It is less ambitious in its scale and story, but the film's impressive visuals make up for its less imaginative direction and sometimes dull screenplay. The computer generated creatures are all remarkable, and the good lion Aslan is realized with the voice of Liam Neeson, who provides the dignity of the character.Tilda Swinton is also impressive as White Witch. Probably she is more famous for playing the unique roles in such films as `Orlando' and `Constantine,' and her enigmatic presence perfectly fits in the ice queen character. Of course, that's unless you have already created your own image of the Witch, but her delightfully twisted acting worked for me. The four main young characters, the four children who wander into the land behind the wardrobe - Edward, Lucy, Peter, and Susan - are all played by newcomers, and their acting sometimes shows it. Not that I am complaining, but it must be admitted that the creatures in Narnia like giants, fawns, beasts, talking animals especially Mr. and Mrs. Beaver are more memorable in the film.Finally, about the tone of the film. The religious connotations are subdued, but you may not find it damaging. The producers are obviously aware that they are making a family picture, and the overall tone of the film is less dark than `Lord of the Rings' or recent `Harry Potter' films. And my verdict: ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is no groundbreaking achievement, but still an entertaining fantasy."	4.0	Adventures in Narnia: Not Groundbreaking, But Still Enjoyable Fantasy Tale	2006-05-21	3	1	2

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	"I need to preface this review by saying that I am a huge fan of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. In fact, they are my favorite books of all time. C.S. Lewis is my favorite author--I've read a wide variety of his works (including some essays he wrote about 17th century English literature) and, in my opinion, the man was not capable of bad writing. I remember when I was about 11-12 years old and after a terrible argument in my family, I tried repeatedly over and over and over to get away from it all and go to Narnia by traveling through a forgotten closet in the house. When I was about 18 along with a rough draft of a screenplay for THE HOBBIT, I also started writing a screenplay for THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE.My petty attempts at bringing the work to life could not even be compared to the live action version of the story that now exists. There is so much about the film that is well done. The acting, the images, the effects, the dialogue, etc.The movie does an excellent job of setting up the plot. For the first five or so minutes of the film the audience isn't greeted by the happy faces of children chatting with fauns or eating supper with cheery beavers. Instead, the movie opens with the Battle of Brittain raging over London and Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter Pevensie being rushed out of their home and into a bomb shelter by their mother. Worried for the life of her children, she ships them off far into the country to live with a gentle, erudite professor (this whole opening sequence would be a great clip to show during a WWII history lesson).One day while playing hide and seek in the huge manor, young Lucy gets lost in the wardrobe she is hiding in and finds herself transported to the magical land of Narnia. There she meets the faun Mr. Tumnus and almost immediately becomes friends. After spending the evening at Mr. Tumnus' home, Lucy returns back through the wardrobe door only to discover that she hasn't been missing at all. The wardrobe is searched, but it seems to be just a plain, beautifully ornate wardrobe.Eventually, however, the truth is revealed and Lucy and all her siblings are transported to Narnia. Edmund, who traveled to Narnia before with Lucy, is captured by the evil White Witch Jadis. To save their brother, the siblings rush to meet the King of the World, Aslan and learn along the way that they are a part of a long-fortold prophecy that is coming true. What follows is a mad dash through a melting winterland, a sacrifice of grandest proportions, and an epic battle led by a teenage king.The visuals in the movie are absolutely stunning. The colors chosen for the creatures who follow Aslan and those who fight under Jadis couldn't be more perfectly matched. The movie follows the plot of the book fairly accurately (there are some dramatic liberties taken and a few things left out--but this is a movie, not a book) without taking anything away from the essence of Lewis' story. Many of the creatures were created either through CGI or good old costume-animatronics and due to the nature of the story, there isn't a ton of dialogue acting. Still, at the heart of the story are the children and Aslan and they come off wonderfully. Liam Neeson is the voice of Aslan and though he sounds different than what Aslan sounds in my head, I think the choice was well made. The children are the true stars of the movie and the standout of the four is Georgie Henley as Lucy. Her reactions are perfect and the relationship between Lucy and Mr. Tumnus (as played by James McAvoy) is especially well done.There have been many comparisons made between this film and Peter Jackson's version of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I've heard some say that this is like a child's version of those movies. The same comparisons were being made between Tolkien and Lewis when their stories were published (except people said that THE LORD OF THE RINGS is like an adult THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE). One cannot deny that if THE LORD OF THE RINGS films had never been made and weren't successful, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE would never have been made into a live action feature film. However, because of the success of The Ring, we can now have all the Chronicles of Narnia on screen, too. Yes, WETA helped make some of the costumes and parts of the movie were filmed in New Zealand. However, despite these similarities, the movies are totally different films. THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a 9-hour epic told in three parts. THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA are a series of 7 separate, yet connected tales all about the same place. TLotR films are very violent with a lot of black orc blood and violent images. LION doesn't have much of that though there are a few (actually, I would have liked to have seen the battles been more graphic--true fairy tales aren't afraid to tell and show the evil and darkness that abounds). Finally, Tolkien was adamant throughout his life that his story was not like Lewis'. On the other hand, Lewis, though he was frank about the stories not being allegories, did say that there were allegorical elements to them. These elements are still preserved in the movie and bring about some of the more powerful moments in the film.Overall, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is an excellent adaptation of C.S.Lewis' beloved opening book of the Chronicles of Narnia. Very young children might be afraid at some moments (though the bright colors might distract them enough not to do so), but for anyone else in the family this movie is highly recommended--unless you don't like fantasy or spirituality.The special 2-disc DVD collection is filled with over 10 hours of extra features. There are commentaries with the director, Andrew Adamson, and the four children who portray the Pevensie children as well as commentary with some Adamson and some of his production crew; there are bloopers; there are several featurettes, including a brief documentary about C.S. Lewis; as well as many other extras. One extra I enjoyed particulary was the ""Legends In Time"" feature. This little ditty is basically a comparison of the time in Narnia and how it compares with time in our world. I found it to be quite clever. The Special Edition DVD of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is a fan's delight."	5.0	The Lion's Roar.	2005-12-13	0	0	0

With cinema reaching its peek with technology and special effects finally the greatest of the classic fantasy tales can be told. Flying off the coattails of probably the greatest epic ever created: J.R.R. Tolkien's `Lord of the Rings', comes his true life friend C.S. Lewis's Epic: `The Chronicles of Narnia'.The Chronicles of Narnia is 7 stories of a fantasy world that has been under the ruling of Jada the White Witch who was told of a prophecy. Four Human Children would find their way to Narnia and when they did they would allow the true ruler of the world to rise and they would rule along side him as royalty. The first movie `The Lion the Witch & the Wardrobe' is actually the 2nd chapter of the Chronicles and in this story the prophecy is fulfilled. The Pevinse siblings who were sent to the country side of London during WWII stumble upon the world of Narnia through an old wardrobe in their foster home. Then their journey beings as they encounter talking animals, incredible dangers and fantastic magic at every turn. Then the true adventures of Narnia begin.Unfortunately for me I had to miss this movie in the theaters. Being a true fan of the epics like `LOTR', `Harry Potter', `Star Wars' etc, I was eager to pick up the DVD. Unfortunately, people were giving this movie a bad rap. One reason was because it was from Disney, two people were talking about the large amounts of Christian overtones and of course people thought it would be extremely childish and toned down. For once in your lives people, try to forget all of that and just pretend it's an actual movie? I don't think that the people who put this movie together would have wanted to ruin the true story at all. The movie was very well done, it was not the best movie I had ever seen, but it was fun it was exciting and it was not Disneyfied at all. If you are into fantasy and happen to have actually read the book then I am sure you will not be disappointed. If you think about it, no one really was. Because with all the bad rap, Narnia remained in the theaters in the top 10 movies for 4 months and `The Prince Caspian' is set for December 2007 release.	4.0	Pretend it's A Movie...

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A25B8W9VSY0C5Y	Vicki Williamson	I have to say that I was a bit skeptical of Disney getting hold of such a classic story and making it into a movie. I figured they would destroy the parallels it has with the story of Christ and his redemption for all mankind. BUT.....that was not so! Disney did such a fantastic job transferring the story from the pages to the big screen.The movie was not only well done by the young actors and actresses but also by the animators. Aslan was just so completely awesome that I kept forgetting he was animated. There were several parts in the movie that I found myself so utterly and completely enthralled and touched that I was choked up. I love the part when Aslan defeats evil. That was just such a powerful part of the movie among many others.Regardless of your age or gender, I highly recommend this movie. My 12-year-old daughter, 36-year-old husband and myself (35 years of age) all loved the movie but for completely different reasons.	5.0	Awesome, powerful movie!	2006-01-07	6	6	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A2RIJ4R7UX8JPS	"Violet ""sweetviolet79"""	And I love it just as much now as I did while still a kid. The special effects are the main draw here. The movie isn't bad but I feel as though the filming had to be a bit rushed. My main and biggest example of this comes just after aslan is sacrificed. One minute the stone table is surrounded by an army of the white witch's monsters but 2 seconds later, they're all gone. That little detail REALLY broke up the flow for me. At least in the old british version there was the transitional scene where you saw a few monsters running away before you see the stone table and aslan again.Overall, I'd say this movie could have been better, but it's still worth a look as it is...	3.0	I grew up with this story	2006-07-01	3	0	3

It is simply amazing what can be done with computer imaging these days. The creatures in Narnia were all completely believable.Now as to the real stars of the show (as far as I'm concerned): Mr. and Mrs. Beaver. These two working-class heroes of Narnia really deserve a film or perhaps a television series of their own. I would love to go to their home for a nice cuppa and chat about the state of the world and things in general. Perhaps they could have a news show or something on the BBC and offer commentary. Barbara Walters should do an interview.Better yet, Mr. Beaver should stand for Parliament! I want to see him challenging Tony Blair on television!

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A31U58HK83GUUB	"Walter Lutsch ""The Dark Knight"""	"This is quite simply the best book to film adaption ever accomplished by Hollywood. EVER.I am an author myself, and part of what inspired me was Narnia. My heart will always be tied to this land created by CS Lewis. It is pure magic, this man was a phenomenal writer and his story is THE original fantasy.First, let me tell you about my usual reviews of book to movie translations.I absolutely detested the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.I know it sounds harsh, but I hated those movies.Peter Jackson, though a great director in his own right, absolutely butchered Tolkiens world.To me, those movies are as if he took the book, rammed it into a shotgun, fired, and picked up scattered remains, glued the mismatched pieces together and handed it to the actors.Thats how bad I think they were.If the books had never been done, those movies would be great as stand alone movies, but they aren't, because they removed many of the better sections of Tolkiens tale.Harry Potter. I loved the first few books, and I got really pissed off at the movie when it came out because once again, they cut out many of the better scenes in the book. I stopped watching the movies after the second one.So, as you can probably expect, when I walked into the movie theater in December, waiting to see The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, I was very antsy, and very skeptical.Narinia was closer to me in my heart than any of the other novels that Hollywood had ruined, so I was expecting the worst, and at the same time, dreadfully depressed at what ""the worst"" could mean.I walked in, I took my seat, and the film started.The beggining ""Blitz"" scene began, and I immediatly noticed how close to reality the planes and bombing manuevers were. (Being a historian at heart, thats a brownie point right there) Then I realised the importance of this first scene. The director was putting the viewer into the middle of Lewis's time. Showing you what surroundings he was writing this from. Right then, I started to hope.And as the movie unfolded, as the children got on the train, and that first opening strain of true ""Narnia"" music began to play, I began to cry.No joke.I sat and cried for the first few minutes as I heard that music.Because I knew right then and there, Narnia had stepped out of CS Lewis's mind, out of his book, and onto this screen.This director had managed to bind the very essence of Narnia into this movie.There are differences. It is true, changes were made. But they were small, they were few, and they were far between.And whatever it was that the director did with this movie, it bound the spirit of the book into this film.I cannot tell you how happy I was when I left that movie theater.There are no words to describe it, and coming from a writer, who describes things for a living, thats pretty damn hard to come by.This film is magical. Everything, all the casting, all the sets, all the lines, are as if they were personally overseen by C.S. Lewis himself. When you watch this film, you are THERE. You have stepped through and walked into Narnia.So, if there is any doubt in your mind about buying or watching this movie I hope I have cleared it up, because I tell you if you shell out whatever cash to buy this, you will be very, very glad you did.The best thing to do with a movie like this, is gather your family close to you, sit on the couch with the lights off, on Christmas Eve, and watch this.Welcome to Narnia folks, I never thought we'd make it, but guess what? Aslan has worked a miracle just for you and me."	5.0	Enter the Wardrobe...	2006-11-22	20	11	9
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1MKR12YTW0XDI	Wanda F. Braun	I love CS Lewis' writing, especially the Chronicles of Narnia. I started reading them to my daughter when she was young and I still have such a fondness for the stories. Lewis captures the story of redemption in such a way that I am filled with wonder each time I read the stories and the movies just add to the enjoyment. I believe Disney and Walden Media really outdid themselves. I wanted to buy the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe for some time and am so glad that I can now enjoy it anytime I desire. I would recommend this movie to anyone, no matter what age they might be.	1.0	The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe: most enjoyable!	2014-06-15	1	0	1
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia can be enjoyed on many levels whether you look at it as a Christian or an atheist. An enjoyable epic saga of good (Aslan the Lion) vs. evil (the White Witch),Lewis' tale begins as Peter, Lucy, Edmund and Susan are placed in the countryside to avoid the destructive bombs of the Nazi's during WWII. They find a gateway to the magical world of Narnia in a wardrobe closet. The children represent liberation fulfills a prophecy where Aslan the Lion (Liam Neeson) will, with their assistance, free the inhabitants of Narnia from the frozen wasteland of the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).Having read the books when I was younger, I have no problem with some of the changes made to the story as they only enhance the film. Remember that often what works on the printed page doesn't work in a film and vice versa. While there's considerable sword play the film is appropriate for most children. There's no swear words nor are there any sex scenes. It's amazing to me that the film got made without Hollywood somehow jazzing up this presentation for the movies. The major battles have much of the scale of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" and this film makes an excellent companion piece to Jackson's trilogy of films about Middle Earth.A marvelous looking DVD, ""Narnia"" is great in either the single disc edition (which is available in widescreen and full screen) or the double disc edition. Which edition you get depends upon how many extras and behind-the-scenes featurettes you want to watch. If the movie is all you want the single disc edition is plenty and has commentary tracks by the director and the children that appear in the movie. There's also outtakes from the movie included as well as ""Narnia Fun Facts"".The two disc edition might appeal more to adult or teenage collectors; it features a number of marvelous featurettes on the production of the movie including ""Chronicle of a Director"" which details the production of the movie. ""The Children's Magical Journey"", ""Creating the Creatures"" (which is pretty self explanatory_ and an excellent if brief featurette on author C. S. Lewis called ""C.S. Lewis: From One Man's Mind"". The ""Anatomy of a Scene"" is marvelous because it breaks down how the sequence where the river is melted was created covering everything that went into this magical and symbolic sequence from the film.There's also a section called ""Creatures, Lands & Legends"" that provides a cool 3-D map of Narnia, a timeline for the film and where it fits in the overall scheme of things and ""Creatures of the World"" featurette that focuses on all the creatures in the mystical land of Narnia. While it's considerably more expensive (depending upon where you purchase it of course) than the single disc set, fans will want to pick up this edition. Reportedly director Andrew Adamson may be working an extended edition of the film to be release just in time for Christmas if the DVD does well. Much like the ""Kong"" set scheduled for Christmas (if there's enough of a demand for it), the ""Narnia"" rumor has it will include an extended cut of the film with deleted scenes in addition to some new featurettes on the making of the film."	5.0	Exceptional film of C.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AHTEDRC5XLKK0	"WebViking ""WebViking"""	There is no other way to describe this movie than it is simply a masterpiece.  I grew up reading the Chronicles of Narnia and 38 years after I first read them I still have the books in my collection.  I will own them for the rest of my life, they are that important to me.  And usually when a film comes out that is taken from a book I love, I find far too much wrong with it because it too many liberites are taken with the story to bring it to the screenBut this movie does as good a job of staying true to the book as any movie I have ever seen.  Narnia comes alive in this movie and the director's vision of Narnia is downright spectacular.  The wardrobe was exactly as I imagined it when I first read the book so many years ago.  And the lampost in the winter Narnia right outside the Wardrobe was perfect.  In the movie, though, you could hear the soft hissing of the gas in the lampost, just an unbelievable touch that is characteristic of this movie.This movie could not have been made even 5 years ago, not in the same form, not as believably as it was made now.  The technology didn't exist even five years ago.  The CGI work was as well done as any movie I've ever seen and was integrated with live actors in an absolutely stunning and jaw-dropping way.  Tummus, the faun, was played by a live actor, and to see him walk into his house with Lucie and stamp the snow from his hooves was absolutely convincing in the movie.  Talking beavers with real expression, no problem.  Centaurs, fugeddabout it, the guys that made this movie knock that out easily.  This is by far the most technically proficient example special effects I have ever seen in a movie.  It makes Lord of the Rings look dated and cheesy.Just stunning, and it doesn't detract from the story at all, because everything is absolutely believeable.  It's that well done.And story, what a story!  Evil exists, and there is no negotiating with it, no ignoring it, no surrendering to it.  Sometimes you just have to fight it, even if you are a child.  It's part of growing up, it's part of being human, it's part of being moral.  It is a choice and it's a choice a moral being makes.  It trumps self-interest.The casting was phenomenal, the acting was fabulous, the story is timeless, and the effects were real life quality.  I was just stunned watching this movie, I can't imagine anything that could possibly make it better.A Masterpeice.	5.0	A Masterpiece	2006-06-01	6	4	2

Their arrival sets into motion a revolution, as the ""good guys"" believe the children are the same four prophesized to bring balance to the force...err, destroy the one ring of power...oops, I mean rescue Narnia from the White Witch.The tale plays to the same Good versus Evil conflict that drives the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings films. It also benefits from similar special effects magic, solid acting and exciting moments of peril. This type of film does not appeal to me (although I loved them when I was younger), so I am not the person to judge how this film compares to the contributions of George Lucas and Peter Jackson. I have a feeling it falls just short of reaching the scope and imagination of those films and (although financially successful) will not match their iconic status.Many define this film by its Christian allegories, which is not fair to the film (for good or bad). People who avoid the film because they believe it to be a tool used to proselytize will also have to miss Superman, The Green Mile, The Matrix and most other films dealing with sacrifice or execution. Yes, the books were written by a Christian and a solid metaphor for Christ exists in the story, but religion does not overwhelm the picture anymore than it does Star Wars or Lord of the Rings."	4.0	Cut from the same stone as Star Wars and Lord of the Rings	2005-12-14	0	0	0

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3J0OXB9KIC5SS	WILLIAM H FULLER	"C. S. Lewis' CHRONICLES OF NARNIA are rather more complex than the surface story indicates at first glance. Although the books and, in this case, the video adaptation of the first book, can certainly be enjoyed at the story, or plot, level, a little thoughtful analysis can extend that enjoyment even further.Certain parallels or equivalencies between Lewis' stories and Christian mythology are immediately obvious: Aslan is Jesus, and I must admit that during the scenes of his execution and reappearance, Johnny Cash's rendition of the Protestant hymn ""Were You There When They Crucified My Lord?"" kept playing through my mind in an endless loop. The seduction of little brother Edmund by the White Witch suggests the legend of the Temptation of Christ by Satan or perhaps even the actions of the disciple Judas Iscariot.  Most obviously, the residents of Narnia refer to the human children who have fallen into their midst as ""children of Eve"" and ""children of Adam,"" and it is these humans, with the aid of Jesus/Aslan, who vanquish evil and bring peace again to the land. The children, therefore, can be seen as Jesus' disciples, spiritually vanquishing destructive forces and bringing salvation to the inhabitants of Narnia.I do find the character of the White Witch troublesome.  She is equated with the frozen death that accompanies unending winter, and her color suggests the frigid sterility of snow and ice.  She is a seductress who almost ensnares Edmund into betraying his siblings.  Beyond her general evil, however, I cannot find a comfortable parallel from Christianity.  She seems more akin to the overseer of the Norse hell, which is a frozen wasteland, for her symbols are the antithesis of the burning, fiery hell of Christianity.  In any event, she symbolically turns souls to stone as she physically  petrifies the bodies of those who displease her. It may be that Lewis intends to cast her as the anti-Christ, and her destruction is a celebration of the superiority of Jesus/Aslan.Lewis' casting of the wolves as the witch's secret police and executioners reflects what must have been his ignorance of and consequential prejudice against these social animals.  It may well have been a common misconception and bias of his place and time, but it perturbs a modern reader and viewer who better understands the true nature of these creatures.Reading the CHRONICLES inevitably leads one to form images of the characters in one's mind and to contrast those images with the ones portrayed in the filmed version.  I was disappointed only in the depiction of Peter, the oldest brother.  He seems less capable in the film than one would expect, and his clumsy pointing of his sword, as though it were a spear, may be realistic for a young lad with no training in use of the weapon, but it is hardly appropriate for a fictional hero.Technically, the film is almost first rate.  The fauns, centaurs, and the Minotaur are wonderfully depicted, as are the other sapient non-humans.  Still, I must use the word ""almost"" because the film-makers apparently did not have enough imagination to create new creatures as warriors for the White Witch and recruited a number of Orcs from the cast of Tolkien's THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies.  Fortunately, the Orcs have simple ""walk on"" parts and never dominate lengthy scenes as they do in the RINGS films.  Also, neither Lewis nor his film adapters have produced as dark and foreboding a story as did Tolkien, though both series are similar allegories depicting the struggle of good against evil.  NARNIA is definitely a lighter film, in terms of both story development and setting, than are the RINGS.  Despite some of my frustrations with it, NARNIA should be highly entertaining and pleasing to most audiences.  The story and its creatures are captivating to younger viewers, and its symbolism and allegorical significance are intriguing to more mature audiences.  By the way, if you have only seen the film, read the book as well; you will not be disappointed."	4.0	Some Sword Lessons for Peter Perhaps?	2006-04-21	7	2	5

This movie does a wonderful job of retelling the story. Of four children, long foretold, suddenly appearing in Narnia. Of one falling into evil, being undeservedly redeemed. Of overcoming, against all hope, the great White Witch. For Christians, a great deal of symbolism is readily apparent. For those who are not...they might not even notice. A wonderful, wonderful story. I felt moved to reread my old copy before and after the movie. Sometimes the emphasis is a little different, but C.S. Lewis left much to the readers imagination. In a movie, you are necessarily taking a ride on someone else's imagination. And they did a good job.	5.0	A Beautiful Story, Wonderfully Told	2006-11-03	2	1	1

But I was very disappointed in the movie.I had heard of it as a Christian allegory. It includes what is essentially a crucifixion and resurrection scene (the lion Aslan agrees to be killed to save the life of Edmund, a boy portrayed as a traitor), but this seems awkwardly placed in an otherwise secular action movie. It just doesn't fit. This was the major source of my disappointment in the movie. On the whole the movie did not seem to me to represent Christian values, and the crucifixion and resurrection bit semed quite discordant with the rest of the movie.The acting was generally good, with the two young actresses playing the two girls offering particularly outstanding performances. But it was basically a fairly run-of-the-mill action movie with the discordant Christian reference just plopped into it.	2.0	Disappointing movie	2006-05-08	7	0	7

Disney jam-packs their BluRay releases with Bonus features, and this one is no exception. When you have a whole extra BluRay (not DVD) of bonus features included.... I think the disc claims over 14 hours.The video transfer is crip and sharp, and film grain is next to non-existant. Colors are vibrant, blacks are true - you would think that this film was shot with HD cameras rather than being a film transfer. The audio tracks will blow you away - just the bombing scene at the begining of the movie with the Dolby Digital soundtrack will work out your subwoofer - mine was bouncing off the floor. But there is more - like most Disney releases, this includes an Uncompressed PCM audio track, which, gratefully, the studio did not limit the disc to work only over HDMI. This is one of the few titles that I was able to export the PCM in 5.1 channels over my toslink cable!Don't be fulled by the number of languages listed on the back of the package - there are WAY more audio tracks than this. Every major European language is represented on the disc, as welll as a few middle eastern and Asian languages. The audio comentaries are actually pretty fun on this disc - I think I had more fun listening to the audio commentary of the children and the director than I had watching the movie.The only drawback to this disc is, like most Disney releases, it is a bit on the pricy side, costing over $25 at Amazon (don't even ask how much this thing costs at Best Buy, you are liable to have a heart attack). However, it was a nice addition to my BluRay collection, and I am sure any fan of this movie and the series would have happily paid twice this for the movie in HD.	5.0	Another amazing BluRay from Disney	2008-06-30	1	1	0

I am a huge fan of Tilda Swinton and have seen most of her stuff since Orlando, but her best work is still The Deep End. I love her icy mysterious looks, very glamorous and powerful. Her porcelain dool face is perfect to play the witch, and she's proven to be a very versatile actress.

Perhaps, despite his wonderful imagination trained by the best stories in the world, would not have enabled him to know what could some day be done with film. Perhaps some day there will even be a remake that will be better! But it will be a long time in coming. This production uses the best in everything it touches. The book is honored by an honest attempt to depict it as it is. Aslan is not too big, nor too small. The White Witch is beautifully done. Kids are going to enjoy this movie and parents will have a wonderful time relating the meaning of the movie to their children. There is deep magic in this movie. If anything, the one fault with it is that it makes us want too much to go into our own wardrobe and stay there.By the way, do not leave the theater when the credits start to run! There is more film left and you will miss it or find yourself standing in a crowd at the back of the theater trying to watch it over everyone's head.Additional comments with the release of the DVD:Besides the comments I have on the movie, this edition containing the interviews, especially with the kids, is a wonderful way to enrich the experience. I note also how the same approach has been taken, for example, with the cast of the Harry Potter movies on the DVD editions, that this introduces a whole new aspect to the art form of movie production. Getting to know how the artists feel about their work. The kids are especially interesting and I notice how they all seem so loveable and bright. Is this a requirement for child actorship? Or is this another part of the packaging and marketing of the movies?Either way, it makes the CSL collection richer.	5.0	C.S. Lewis would love it!	2005-12-10	14	7	7

My biggest complaint was that it was too similar to Lord of the Rings.  The movie seemed to follow the same formula as Lord of the Rings and also had some similar scenes.  But that aside, the two other things that bothered me was that some of sets (like the forest that is first entered after going through the wardrobe) didn't fool me into thinking it was a real forest.  To me, sets like this seemed very claustrophobic with forced shots so the audience could only see parts of the fake snow-covered christmas trees.  One other thing that I would have liked to see more of was the professor.  I found his character to be intriging and I would have loved to find out more about him.  Maybe a flashback at one point of his experiences in the Wardrobe, or an explaination on why he is so interested in it.About the whole Christianity thing.  It wasn't overly done.  I picked up a few biblical allusions in the movie, but it wasn't too bad as I was watching it.  It did sort of bother me that the animals that had never seen humans before in Narnia were able to know both old and new testiment bible stories.  It wasn't till later (about a half hour ago) that it dawned on me that Aslan the lion was basically Jesus (he comes to save Narnia from dark times, he is executed, he is reserrected, and then disappears until he is needed again).  That kind of turned me off that the whole story was based off of the story of Jesus, only personified as a lion, but then again, it is a genius way to rip off an old story to turn create a series of books that have almost a cult following (people were dressed up like the characters where I saw it).Overall, I'd give it 3 stars.  Not bad, but with room for improvement.	3.0	An okay movie, but too similar to Lord of the Rings	2005-12-11	17	2	15
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3GVOPJWXAJ1WD	"W. Paul W. ""Paul White"""	"First the movie: It's a pretty faithful adaptation of Lewis' novel.  There are minor changes but nothing major.  Acting is decent, direction is good, and the special effects are outstanding. The novel was a remarkable children's story of redemption and salvation, and the filmmakers avoided simplifying it or softening some of the harder edges.  There isn't blood and gore, but there are still fairly intense battle scenes.  Great movie for families (and I do mean families, not just kids).  It's got a story most children will relate to (wicked witches, annoying siblings, events that they can't entirely control), and it's got enough meat on it to satisfy adults as well. There's isn't any vulgarity or nudity or anything like that, although the battle scenes may be a bit scary for very young kids.The transfer quality was outstanding; this was the first movie I purchased on blu-ray and man oh man, was it a good choice :) Notably better than the DVD on my set (50"" 1080p samsung plasma)."	4.0	Excellent movie, excellent transfer	2009-01-01	0	0	0
0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3OND36Q71G76D	W. Scott Heitman	"I admit that going into the theater I was skeptical.  Could Disney possibly handle the allegorical elements of Lewis' work with the necessary care?  Would the movie be missing any core scenes?  The trailers I had seen seemed to indicate that some things would be changed...and for the worse.My fears, it would appear, were for naught.  Not only is the movie ENTIRELY true to Lewis' story AND allegory....it also manages to be as cinematically engaging as anything else I've recently seen.  Not only that...it accomplishes all of this without the slightest profanity or drop of blood; this movie, like the book, has a heart of gold and should make for great family fare. Detailed breakdown as follows:ACTING: For a movie with 4 kid/teen actors as the main characters, the acting was surprisingly good.  Give me any one of these four over Dakota Fanning.  It's good that the acting worked, too, because here is a story that wouldn't work without it.  The rest of the cast is equally fantastic: Jim Broadbent plays a very endearing professor, Liam Neeson voices the all-important Aslan, and Tilda Swinton (think Gabrielle from Constantine) plays a very dislikeable White Queen.STORY:  How much or how little a viewer gets out of the storywill depend on how familiar they are with its Christian allegory aspects.  So many scenes and lines are handled with the proper emotional deference considering what lies behind the surface story.  Lewis' depiction of Christ as Aslan and Satan as the White Witch is timeless.  There is just so much emotion here in this movie that draws upon these two metaphors.  SPECIFIC SPOILER:  For instance, there is a scene where one animal excitedly asks another animal ""So what is Aslan like!?""...the animal replies with a joyful expression, ""He's everything we've hoped he is and more.""  The sincerity and joy of this line is simply SO RIGHT when we consider that, in fact, he's talking about Christ.  That's the joy that the angels and some followers of Christ express over meeting Him and being with Him.While the movie is very loyal to the books, there are also a few scenes added on.  Surprisingly, these scenes work very well and add a bit more depth to the story.The movie can and will be enjoyed on a non-religious level.  On it's own, it's a heartwarming, and engaging story.  Paired, with it's allegorical elements, however, Narnia is an emotional epic surpassing the Lord of the Rings.SCORE: Amazing.  The score elevates every important scene of the movie without being distracting.CINEMATOGRAPHY:  Like the Harry Potter movies, Narnia features some very impressive fantasy scenery.  Several shots were simply breathtaking.  It's also worthy to note that the battles scenes came off very well.  I went in not expecting to see any good action, but the choreography of the fights was impressive and visceral without being gory.Once Lucy entered the warddrobe, I knew I was in for a great, emotional ride.  I can't say how well Memoirs of a Geisha and King Kong will do, but my money is on Narnia for best movie of the Holiday season.  Don't miss it!"	5.0	A Cinematic Triumph and Loyal Testament to Lewis' Classic Allegory	2005-12-09	18	12	6

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3JG8IW8QYDV56	"Yogini ""Yogini the Signature Artist"""	'The Chronicles of Narnia' is film written and based upon the christian fictional literature and writings of C. S. Lewis. For those who are fans of works such as 'The Screwtape Letters' in which a demon and a demon in training is explaining how to overcome humanity with the temptations of evil, basicallyteaching christians vividly the assaults of the Devil against the people of God might see this movie as a watered-down version like the Stars Trilogy dealing with the controversy between Christ and Satan.But most might get lost in the metaphors of C. S. Lewis and might see this film as a feeble attempt to do a 'Harry Potter' for those born-again. It is all a matter of perspective and also your knowledge of the Bible in understanding the symbolisms.	3.0	Good Movie but you may get lost in C.S. Lewis's Metaphors	2006-05-13	6	0	6

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A1LWKTFMPGJ803	Your BFF	The only reason I bought this particular Narnia DVD was b/c I saw on tv that Disney was going to put it in the vault, so I had to get it before it disappeared and it was a good price for all the special features and everything.  I like the box design, it's very cool.  I love the movie.  Special features are pretty cool if you're that much of a fan, if not, just get the simple DVD.	4.0	Narnia	2007-02-19	3	2	1

The extended version fills in a lot of the blanks and I recommend heartily.The only drawback was that the booklet accompanying the set was missing and I had to contact Disney to secure it.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	A3LBZLI0FOL2YP	Zeph Greenwell	I watched this movie shortly after reading the book and it was pretty much the same but there were some differences. If you notice the differences they're annoying, if you don't then I wont ruin it for you.The movie cinematicly looks ok. I would say the team at disney did a great job, but it wasn't as good as I had pictured for all the hype, and what I envisioned from reading the book.After reading the book I had idea in my mind as to what certain characters and events looked like. In my mind I had always pictured Aslan as a much larger lion. I had also pictured a much more greusome stone tablet scene, but I knew it was disney and a kids movie so I guess I can't complain about that. I also found the kids to be much more annoying in the movie than on the page.As it goes this is obviosly the best movie version of the lion the witch and the wardrobe to date, but that isn't saying much. There really is nothing to make this movie exceptional and I think if you are a halfway decent reader you should just stick to the book. It took me longer to watch the whole movie then it did to read the entire novel.If you weren't already a fan of this series then I would say you're better off just renting this one. If you are already a fan of the series then you don't need my review to tell you to buy this DVD.	3.0	Looks ok... Follows book ok... acting is ok... music is ok	2006-04-13	8	2	6

It is completely unoriginal and is a hodge podge of borrowed fantasy and mythological creatures set in a preachy judeo-christian story line.

While this is a childrens movie, the story line is easy and fun to follow for any age.  This was one of the best movies ever based off a novel.

0788860704	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	AE9GUE3HHOX3U	zooni	Why watch Narnia when you can watch the Wizard Of Oz?  They are basically the same movie, lost souls searching for themselves and a better world.  The only difference is Wizard Of Oz is a timeless magical tale and there are flying monkies instead of Narnia's talking wolves.  Narnia lumbers along with computer generated talking animals that look fake beyond belief.  They talk like psycho adults bumbling around like fools on a mission.  I'm sure it's great for children, this really is a children's film in the end.  The enchantment is missing from this film.  instead we get harsh winter scenes and a nasty war towards the end.  I never finished the rest of the film, it had me dozing off so I shut it down before the war, I assume.  If you want to see good fantasy films I would recommend The Wizard Of Oz, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy or even The Others.  Narnia just didn't hit me over the head.	1.0	The Wackness	2008-09-24	23	4	19
