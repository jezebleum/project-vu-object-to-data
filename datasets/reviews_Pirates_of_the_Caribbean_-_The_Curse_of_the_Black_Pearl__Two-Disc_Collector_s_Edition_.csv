This movie is a great adventure that will have you bubbeling for more. That is why they are making a second Pirates Of The Caribbean, Treasures Of The Lost Abyss. Thank goodness for Jerry Bruckheimer! Wonderful movie, dazzeling actors ( one nominated for an acadamy), great special effects, and knock your socks off makeup (also nominated) will give you the ride of a lifetime.

It is her ""all-time favorite movie."" -I can see why!As the movie starts out, we come to understand that the Governor's daughter is fascinated by pirates. They rescue a young boy from a burning pirate ship - the movie gives hints that he may be a pirate himself. This sets up the rest of the movie.It is an easy to follow story of a pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow(Depp), on a mission to get his ship (The Black Pearl) back from a fellow pirate who committed mutany taking it away. This pirate and his crew also gained the curse of the undead. They are unable to be killed (as they are already ""dead""!), and unable to taste food, feel things, etc. like normal humans. Very interesting - and the special effects are great!  Depp has many good lines here!I don't want to give it all away, so I will stop there! Hopefully I have peaked your interest enough to convince you to invest in this one.It is not a ""scary"" movie, but I did have to explain some things to my 4 & 5 yr old daughters.

"""Pirates of the Caribbean-The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a relentless action adventure that is thoroughly entertaining.  The audience is seldom left to catch its breath scene for scene that cleverly reinvents swashbuckling.  The dueling scenes are inventive and the cinematography and choreographing of battles are superb.  Captain Jack (Johnny Depp) creates entertainment par excellence as the funny pirate, and Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) is captivating.  We have constant changing hands from the British to the pirates from prisoners to capturing, to blackmail, etc.The main premise is that the pirates are under a curse where they can duel and be hurt but never die.  They are interested in British booty, something the military will deny.  In the course of events is Elizabeth's interest in Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the local blacksmith, even while she is being wooed by the aristocratic Commodore.Non-stop adventure with new twists and turns with every camera angle make ""pirates'... fine entertainment.  Even if it gets tiresome at times when the pirates, unfairly, never die."	4.0	Endless Booty	2006-07-07	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ABQQROIQFW5DE	4everblue	I have to admit, I was skeptical about this movie when it first came out. I didn't think I could really enjoy what looked like a cheesy Disney pirate movie. Boy, was I wrong. I thought this movie was a fantastic tale of adventure that could appeal to all ages. The special effects were awesome and very realistsic, and the dialogue was witty and entertaining. Johnny Depp's character was fascinating to watch on screen. His eccentricities gave a wonderful humorous tilt to a tale of curses and death. My favorite aspect of the movie, however was the music. The booming, fast-paced anthems of adventure on the high seas really drove the film home. One of the neat aspects of the film is that small scenes from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disney World are portrayed exactly the same in the movie. This film is excellent, and I would recommened it to anyone looking for an intriguing tale of sword fighting, ghosts, and stolen treasure.	5.0	A fantastic adventure!	2004-01-06	1	1	0

Too much fun. I had a smile on my face the whole way through and even afterwards. No one has played a pirate quite like Depp. He's flamboyant, foppish, charming, and cunning all at the same time. He truly is the shining point of this film, but a good performance by Geoffrey Rush and goofy lesser characters can't be discounted.I got this DVD and watched it with 20 friends on a 60 inch flat screen TV with a killer surround system. Everyone had a blast and we enjoyed the numerous features in addition to the flick itself. Check out the outtakes, but stay away from the interactive tour of the ship. I honestly don't know why they wasted their time making that. It's pretty worthless.Are you looking for a fun film to add to your collection, that everyone will enjoy, a film that you won't get tired of...Well look no further! This film is truly a treasure.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1PB2W640Z87RJ	"Abhilash.R ""The Sagittarian"""	I never saw the theme park rendition of this gorgeous movie, but I guess it's safe to say it is a massive treat for all ages. And it's also safe to say The Pirates of the Caribbean is faithful to its original theme. And what an adaptation it is...Anybody going to this movie for a history lesson would do better to watch the History Channel. Make no mistake. This is a straight-laced, on your face, bang on entertainment. The story is simple but rivetting.A mystical, near legend, pirate ship called the Black Pearl is out retrieving the Aztec gold it scattered across the vast expanses of the Caribbean. Any mortal soul who picks even a single gold corset from the cursed stone chest, will be damned for all eternity, only able to show his true undead form in moonlight. If all of the 882 gold corsets are replaced in the stone chest, the curse will be lifted. The pirates restore all of them except one. Where is it?. Who has it?.... And how to get it?.This preamble alone should give you an idea of what is in store for you in this movie. Betrayal, revenge, love and action are seamlessly blended to make The Pirates of the Caribbean a must watch. And if that is not enough, then watch the stars in action..(or acting!). Jonny Depp, as the rogue pirate Jack Sparrow, will amaze you with his acting repertoire. Along with Sean penn, he is probably the finest actor of  his generation. I dont know how much he moulded his character in the lines of Keith Richards, but it truly is one-of-a-kind. Depp's character is rather a cross between an evangelist and a gender confused woman. His gait itself will make you laugh and oh yes, his dialogues are the best in the movie. Geoffrey Rush as the double-crossing first-mate Captain Barbossa is an equal match to Depps multi-layered persona. Make no mistake. These two protagonists alone would see the movie through in equal measure.  The lovely Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, Orlando Bloom as the love-struck Will Turner, Johnathan Pryce as Governor Swann of Port Royale and Jack Davenport as Commodore Norrington more than add quality acting to the movie. Disney has done well to renounce too much gore and make the movie available for all age groups. Apart from a popping eye (hilarious stuff!), nothing else in the movie could be termed by anyone as more than an 'uggh'....Director Gore Verbinski has started off from where he left with Mouse Hunt. Both the movies are a tribute to Verbinski's versatality as a 'people's director'. The special effects are astounding and the undead form of the pirates is rendered to the last detail. The music is witty and refreshingly upbeat, keeping with the tempo of the movie. And the movie dialogues are humorous and creative.This movie will no doubt spawn a sequel and guys like me only hope that the original cast would remain untouched. Afterall, how do you expect others to beat the tone and expression of Depp when he says &quot;But why is the rum gone?...&quot;	5.0	A shiver me' timber swashbuckling entertainment....	2004-06-12	4	3	1

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1DS5L6H7JKCQD	A College Student	"Growing up as a kid I had to been to Disney World many times with my family.  The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was one of my favorite rides.  You get in these little row boats and it takes you through this journey of a night in the wild Caribbean in the time of the pirates.  So of course, when I heard about this movie coming out I knew I had to see it.  Not to mention that Orlando Bloom is probably one of the hottest men alive and since the time period was appropriate all the actors used their natural British accents!  The music is so neat; it works so well with the picture and the order of the events.  As the movie went on all of the elements from the ride at Disney World were taken and put right into the movie.  It was almost like you were back on the ride at Disney World.  I was absolutely amazed how well they took these scenes out of the ride and put them right into the movie.Filmed on location in the sunny Caribbean, the overall story line obviously went far past the ride though.  The movie starts out as a flash back that Elizabeth Swan is having about the first time she ever encountered pirates which sparks her fascination from then on.  As the story unfolds, the unfortunate Captain Jack Sparrow (played by the amazing Johnny Depp) who was marooned on an abandoned island by his crew of enchanted friends and fellow pirates.  The story continues with a funny tale of a merchant worker who encounters this so called ""famous pirate"" Captain Jack Sparrow and their adventures together after each learns that they can help one another in some way.  They become friends and foe in a matter of a film.  Twisting through and before all this crazy plot is the love romance between Elizabeth Swan (played by the young Keira Knightley) , the governor's daughter, and Will ""William"" Turner (played by the gorgeous Orlando Bloom) , the merchant boy with the dark surprise that even he doesn't know about.  Jack Sparrow and William Turner have more in common then either of them ever knew about and this little bit of information helps them to both get what they both desire, treasure, of different sorts that is.  Elizabeth at a young age comes in contact with something that the Pirates of the ship the Black Pearl want; Jack Sparrow through out the movie is chasing after this dark pirate ship; Will Turner wants to be the hero of the story by capturing this pirate who is running the streets of his town and save the beautiful Elizabeth when she encounters trouble.  All of these three main characters are tied together in some way and none of them know that.  With witty lines and an enchanted character cast, including Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa, the new evil conniving captain of The Black Pearl,  this movie will having you want a piece of your own treasure to take home with you, or perhaps your own piece of Aztec Gold, just make sure you stay out of the moonlight.This movie was one of my favorite all time movies.  I loved the cast and I thought that they played their characters each to their best, I honestly couldn't think of a better casting line.  The jokes and little things are what made this movie absolutely hilarious!  It's one of those movies that will have you watching it twice just so you can catch everything that is going on.  You will fall in love with this movie, as did I, and I can now probably recite this movie word for word without having to watch it.  Also another great thing about this movie is that they are going to be working on a Pirates 2, and that is due to come out sometime between 2005 and 2006.  I can not wait to see what is going to happen to the movie and where they are going to take it!"	5.0	Hot Hot Hot!!!	2004-09-29	1	0	1

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AO3JW5VHT2GQ	A Customer	Summary:Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is the former captain of the Black Pearl, the most infamous pirate ship in the Caribbean.  But, as the result of a mutiny, he has lost his ship to Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), his first-mate.  Marooned on an island, Sparrow eventual escapes only to end up in a port town controlled by an actual government.  Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) and the leader of the government's fleet, Norrington (Jack Davenport), are in charge of the port town and, obviously, don't take kindly to pirates.Governor Swann's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), however, has a dark fascination with pirates, even though she is being courted by Norrington.  The last major character in the film is Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the son of a pirate and the key to removing the Curse of the Black Pearl.Will is in love with Elizabeth.  But, he's only a blacksmith who makes swords and studies swordplay.  When Sparrow shows up in the port town he is captured but makes his getaway only to run into Will.  The result is an exciting swordfight that ends with Sparrow's defeat and re-capture.But before any harm can come to Sparrow, the port is attacked by Barbossa and the crew of the Black Pearl.  They are looking for the last piece of gold from a cursed Incan treasure chest.  The curse made anyone who took a piece from the chest undead.  Moonlight alone reveals the fact that they are all now rotting skeletons.  Barbossa has caught wind that Elizabeth has the gold piece, which she does, but only because she took it from Will Turner when he was saved from the shipwreck and never told anyone.  Barbossa's pirates are unstoppable (because they are undead), so they eventually capture Elizabeth and the gold piece.  Meanwhile, Will takes it upon himself to get her back, but can't do it without the help of Sparrow - so he breaks him out.Sparrow and Will then steal one of the navy ships and go after Barbossa.  Of course Norrington is also involved in the hunt, but where it gets really tricky is when Barbossa realizes he needs Will's blood along with the last piece of treasure in order to remove the curse.  Why? Because Will is actually the son of one of Barbossa's pirates and for some reason (see below) it is his blood that is needed.Eventually, Sparrow and Will, with Elizabeth's help, defeat Barbossa, get back the Black Pearl, remove the curse, and Will and Elizabeth get together.  Wow that's complicated.My Comments:This is a very entertaining film.  It's fun, exciting, and engaging, but it has some serious story problems that prevented me from giving it five stars.First, why is Sparrow in the port town?  Yes, it's a cool scene where he arrives in town on a boat that is sinking, and yes, he does say he is there to commandeer a ship.  But why here?  And why not just get a ship in the pirate's cove where all of the other pirates hang out? Another major problem with the story is the whole 'needing Will's blood' thing.  Why Will's blood is needed instead of, say, Elizabeth's is never convincingly explained.  There is an attempt to make an argument that it's because of Will's dad, but this is completely unconvincing.  My last major criticism with the story is what happens to the pirates when the curse is removed.  All of Barbossa's men are suddenly dying, including Barbossa.  But Sparrow was stabbed through the chest only moments before this.  Why doesn't he die?  Most of the story problems can be overlooked, but, at the same time, some of them are rather crucial to the outcome of the story.  Yes, it's a good movie, but it could have been better.As for the acting, Johnny Depp is incredible.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie where I didn't think he was great.  He makes a bizarre but intriguing pirate.  The only criticism I would make of Depp as Sparrow is that he's a little small compared to many of the other pirates, which seems a bit counter-intuitive, but what do I know about pirates?  Geoffrey Rush is also very good and so is most of the rest of the cast.  However, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom aren't great.  I think the problem is that they are a couple of young actors whose shortcomings are forced to the fore as the result of having to work with people like Depp and Rush.  They aren't so bad that you can't stand to watch the movie, but when either Depp or Rush isn't on the screen, the movie just isn't as good.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.  It does have some shortcomings, but even with the story problems and the mediocre acting from two of the main characters, I would highly recommend it.	4.0	Fun but not perfect	2003-12-13	7	3	4
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3SJG69NUSJ2QI	Adam Raper	I think Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is this summers best movie.  I was looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I saw the preview for the first time.  I loved every minute of this movie.  The action in this movie is awesome and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The sword fights are very fun to watch.  This movie is scary in a lot of places especially with the cursed pirates (which is where the special effects are the best).  Johnny Depp is very hilarious in this movie, and he does a great job not to go overboard with his humor.  Plus there is a little bit of romance in the movie that takes place but it doesn't happen until towards the end of the movie.  This is one of those few movies that charms the audience plus it outstays its welcome.  If I could see a movie twice, it would be this one.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, go see it!

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G	"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF"""	There have been a lot of half-crazed movie characters in film history, you know the one; the kind of vaguely insane person that the movie truly revolves around, with the other characters only there to provide stark contrast with their recognizably sane posture.  They're also there to wonder aloud to themselves and each other, &quot;What's the matter with him?&quot;  To which someone usually responds, &quot;I don't know, but there's something about him that I like.&quot;  The thing about those movies (a lot of them came out of the 80's and early 90's, I know because in school we all imitated them), was the the core of those movies was the zany character exploration, and that was just about it.  See what kind of situations we can cook up and then throw this crazed, witty personae in there and see what happens.What's different about Pirates of the Caribbean, and Jack Sparrow in particular, is that the world he inhabits gave birth to him.  In the crazed personae movie--the nut-job seems to come out of nowhere, completely unexpected, which is half the fun but also half the shortcoming.  In Pirates of the Carribean, we expect Jack Sparrow to come sailing out of the horizon and to suddenly arrive in that world, and what a world!I think what lends Sparrow such credibility is his mixture of characterization.  Yes, he's wild and I suppose &quot;free,&quot; but there are moments where he gets serious (saluting the dead pirates), moments when he has to act and can pull through (like jumping in to save Elizabeth), moments where he has to educate (telling Will Turner the truth about his father).  When this happens, we give the character Sparrow something we don't give the hollow, crazed personae; respect.  Give Johnny Depp all the credit for being able to switch between these modes as well; being serious and respectable while maintaining the aura of Jack Sparrow; that he'll stick his tongue out at us and run off with the gold at any moment, but not without his effects.The world of &quot;Black Pearl&quot; is lush and surprising.  I didn't expect to believe the world of pirates, where all the exsists is ocean and the few ports that you can sail to.  Come to think of it, we only really see three locales during the whole movie, and the rest of it is on water.  How'd they pull that off?  My favorite scene is in the pirate pub where the bar-fight is perpetual; Jack Sparrow and his cohort (can't remember his name) sit and talk about ports, treasures, old pirates, schemes, boats, etc. all in the warm glow of candles and wood as they chug ale.  A pirate's life for me!Geoffery Rush, brilliant as ever.  When he says, &quot;Too long have I been without the taste of food or the comfort of a woman&quot; I believe him.  The man is a pirate outright, but in his eyes you can see the years of torment on a man from the curse piling up on him slowly.  Notice too how he rolls his eyes perfectly when he's at the moment of breaking the curse, and somehow Jack Sparrow convinces him not to.  How?  Maybe &quot;Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; is really how Jack Sparrow has dogged Barbossa his whole career.The supporting cast is good, even Orlando Bloom who is still in Legolas mode.  Even though he played up Will Turner nicely as a bright-eyed, talented, somewhat intense young man (who has serious anxieties about his lineage, but why not?  It would bar him from his chances of Elizabeth), I did keep expecting him to jump up and go, &quot;He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn!&quot;  He does have a great moment where he jumps onto a ship with Sparrow and goes, &quot;Aye, avast!&quot; to which he's promptly laughed at.	5.0	Not a dull moment	2004-01-28	5	4	1

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2RTXVYYU7FEK8	Aggie von S	I normally don't write online reviews, but I was inspired by someone who is trying to make PotC sound likesome sort of watered down version of a typical ghost story, which it definitely is not. Unlike some people who only like movies that have explosions every ten seconds and violent gore, I think this movie is good for the people that like movies that have a little bit of every genre in them. It has drama, romance, horror, comedy and action all in one fell swoop. The plot (although not original) is told in an entertaining way, and the fact that a pirate story could be told without resorting to complete and utter depravity is a testament to the good writing. It's not a deep-thinking kind of movie, but just a fun one.	4.0	A Great Movie in General	2003-09-12	2	2	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ASLQ16GQ9X8CS	Alan	"Who new a Disney movie about pirates could be so fun to watch?  PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN has been an enormous hit, scoring many fans and earning great money in theatres and now it is on DVD.  The movie stars Johnny Depp (from ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO), Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, and Geoffrey Rush.  The movie is about pirates, the sea, and adventure.  Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a weird, rougish, and sometimes hilarious pirate.  He is at a run-in against the law (the British government) and has a penalty of death by hanging for his small and unimportant, but many crimes.  The governor's daughter Elaine Marley (played by the beautiful Kiera Knightley whos starred in BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM) has the Black Pearl, an artifact that everyone in the movie seems to want.  She got it when she was a child, and when they found Guybrush Threepwood, the man Elaine loves (played by Orlando Bloom from LORD OF THE RINGS).  When Elaine gets kidnapped by immortal pirates, led by Captain LeChuck (Geoffrey Rush).  Sparrow convinces Threepwood to go and rescue the girl, and the adventures follows.The movie is fun to watch with pretty cool action sequences, and excitement as well.  Depp makes a spectacular performance as Captain Sparrow, and adds a flavor to the film that just wouldn't be good without him.  Sparrow is a hilarious character and makes the movie very funny at times.  It is a truly ""fun flick"" that is just awesome to watch.  The movie was directed by Gore Verbinski who also directed THE RING, another one of my favorite movies.  With the help of the writers of SHREK, you can see how the movie became sucessful.  A great family film (though it is PG-13) and certaintly one of the better movies.  Go watch it!"	5.0	Excellent Movie, Go Watch It!	2003-10-31	7	3	4
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ABO182YN0SC67	albino_squirrel	Argh.No pun intended, I'm sad to say.I had expected so much from this film because it was hyped to the roof by so many critics and by people I knew, and it turned out to be juvenile, redundant, and a mere plodding from one scene/location to the next.This film almost completely lacked momentum, characters were completely expendable or terribly undefined, the score was monotonous, and the entire movie was painfully unfunny.  I think I laughed twice, or chuckled, rather.The problem is that the movie is rarely clever, and even Sparrow is only sporadically humorous.  Actually, he could have been really funny, except the scene direction, script, and his co-stars weighed him down.  For instance, when he's trying to distract the two guards during the commodore's promotion ceremony, the guards' lines were so obviously tailored for the folks at home (so we dolts can figure out what the Black Pearl is--how considerate), that Depp's very being near such dialogue was cringe-worthy for me.And I ask you, how many times are we supposed to find it funny when someone gets clobbered in the head?  Or when an undead guy's eye falls out?  Or when the zombie monkey bares its fangs?  And why are we supposed to care about some nameless British navy guys while they're fighting with some undead guys, and with the utmost in confusing and erratic editing, besides?The worthwhile aspects of this movie were wasted (such as Barbosa's motivation for wanting the curse lifted, i.e. his lackluster existence), and the expendable aspects (the two pirates in drag in the dingy) were stretched paper thin, and the movie grows wearisome about halfway through.Further, couldn't the makeup artist have laid off the bright pink lipstick when doing Elizabeth's makeup?  And did she really need strategically placed highlights in her hair?  We're supposed to see her as independent, headstrong, and feisty, and yet the makeup department still has to doll her up most ridiculously.Many people love or enjoy this movie.  Perhaps I'd like it better upon second viewing, and I'm going to watch it again to see if I can appreciate whatever I might have missed.  However, if I still find it dull, uninspired, and tedious, I will &quot;curse&quot; myself (argh) for wasting 2.5 hours when I should have known better.	3.0	SWIMAWAYFAST!	2003-12-02	17	3	14

Johnny Depp steals the show and gives the best performance of his acclaimed career as Captain Jack Sparrow, one of the best movie characters of all time. Orlando Bloom,Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley all do good jobs in their respective roles, but Depp made this movie an instant classic with his portrayal of a looney captain on a mission to retrieve his ship. The action sequences are amazing and the special effects are great, as is the story telling. This is the best adventure I have seen since Indiana Jones.

There were only two reasons why I wanted to see the movie.  1) Orlando Bloom is in it.  He's my favourite actor. 2) I LOVE pirate tales and movies such as that.The movie starts out fairly simple (I'm trying my best not to give anything away), which is Elizabeth Swann's dream.  Will and Elizabeth seems to be very fond of another in the first place, but both can't quite tell the other yet, but you can see it their eyes.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a pirate (good tricky one at heart), who then teams up with Will Turner.  Together, they set sail with a crew to find 'The Black Pearl' (which is a ship).I can't really say more, I'm afraid I'll end up spoiling everything. :P	5.0	My new favourite movie.	2003-07-09	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A12U9JUEV7042J	Alex	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a fantasy film, that came into theatres 2003, which is based on the Pirates of the Caribbean Rollercoaster at Disney World. As the title already reveals the film deals with pirates. There is the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who has lost his ship - the Black Pearl - to his former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). On his chase he is supported by the young blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who wants to rescue his love Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). The Governer's daughter is kipnapped by the crew of the Black Pearl and is the first to discover their secret.The, also financially, very successful movie is a great spectacle. It includes humor, fun, action and a story with surprising twists that captures its audience. Regarding the perfect cast, Jerry Bruckheimer understands how to put his actors in action and how to underline the originality of each character. This leads to a very specific character, namely Jack Sparrow, who's uniqueness keeps the audience's attention on him for the entire, relatively long movie (144 minutes). But it is also the love story of young Will Turner and the noble Elizabeth Swann who, quite quickly comes to like the thrills of the buccaneer's life, which provides many humoristic moments, especially in the interaction with a bunch of dead guys - Barbossa's Crew.	5.0	General review	2013-06-12	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A224I2RLN078MW	Alex	Pirates of the Carribean is the best movie of the summer of 2003. It draws you in, throws you off a plank, shoots you through a canon, and spits you back out. It's just a wild ride. The whole overall feel of the movie is so... refreshing. Just the swashbucking, scurvy mates, ahoy... that hasn't been done in so long. The sword fights are great, the moonlight effects are excellent, plus bonus points for having a demon monkey. I really liked Keira Knightly, whose scenes on the island with Johhny Depp are just so fun. Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush do well with their parts, but the movie is really stolen by Johnny Depp. His amazingly hilarious Jack Sparrow is an example of great acting. He created a whole little world with his character, with his pronunciation, and his wacky hand motions.Don't miss out on this amazing film!	5.0	"""I'm Captain Jack Sparrow..."""	2003-11-12	4	4	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3B3BG68EQLXL2	Alia	"To my abiding chagrin, it turned out to be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. It shouldn't be good; it's a pirate movie based on a half-century old theme park ride made by happy-singing-trite-n'-bland Disney, starring Johnny makin'-bad-career-decisions Depp and produced by talking-kangaroos?!?! Bruckheimer. It should stink. Worse, there are zombie monkeys, a flouncing damsel-in-distress, ""Legolas"" as the world's scrawniest blacksmith, plus the genre obligatory swinging by ropes, cannon fights, and scads of unwashed pirates. How could this possibly be good?It was fantastic. In part, for exactly the reasons it should stink. God bless whoever thought to load the cannons with silverware, because that summarizes the outlook of the whole movie. Every possible genre assumption is not-quite-right: the damsel is bright and does pretty well rescuing herself and her man; the pirates desperately want to give the treasure back; the brazen pirate captain doesn't even have a ship; the comedic pair of solders staunchly charge into battle; the ""blood sacrifice"" is something akin to the finger-prick test for blood iron; the intrepid sailing is done not by His Majesty's fleet or the pirates but a pair of women; and no good deed goes unpunished by the British--wait, that last part is fairly standard in American movies. In addition to all this, there are a lot of little details that come back much later as momentous facts and help to explain just how scheming is far more important than swordplay in determining the final outcome. It's a thinkin' pirate-ghost story-comedy-adventure-romance movie, sort of.There were four screenwriters, and I can't help but wonder if the last two (previously of ""Shrek"" and ""Aladdin,"" which explains the monkey) didn't hijack a perfectly staid costume drama with the standard romantic plot (you can still see evidence of this movie, made palatable by what else is going on) and shift gears, focus, and possibly planets, by letting the whole thing be ""commandeered"" by a pirate--not just any pirate, but a dissipated Rasta mad-genius pirate who seemingly got lost on his way to the ""Pirates"" ride and instead went on the ""Tea Cups"" a few dozen times. Helmed by a man with a compass that doesn't point north (figuratively and literally), the movie goes to far weirder, better places than it should.Here's to dementia and rum.

This is one of my favorite movies.  It has everything.  A great cast, a great story, great action, and wonderful visuals.  You'll believe you are back in time and living with cutthroats.  But wait there's more, you also have a supernatural element that makes this like Lord of the Rings meets Black Beard the pirate.The whole idea seems rediculous, but with Johnny Depp as CAPTIAN Jack Sparrow, he makes it all work.  Too be fare Orlando Bloom as Will Turner is the actual hero of the story, but without a doubt Depp is the star.  The movie would not work without him at such a great level.Then there is Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, who is as lovely as she is adventrous.  Knightley really is a great actress and her character is essential to the story so she isn't just another pretty girl in an action movie, though undoubtedly she is absolutely beautiful.I won't go into the story since others here have already, but I will say that if you love pirate movies or action movies or comedies or romance or horror movies, this movie has it all and it's all top notch.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3EBHHCZO6V2A4	"Amaranth ""music fan"""	"""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" has an outwardly ridiculous premise-turning a popular Disney theme park ride into a movie. One would assume it's a recipe for disaster-like Disney's straight-to-DVD sequels to its beloved fairy tales (anybody here seen ""Cinderella 3: A Twist in Time""?) Thanks to the flamboyance of Johnny Depp, the leading pretty boy charisma of Orlando Bloom, and the over-the-top villainy of Geoffrey Rush, it's an enjoyable ride.Johnny Depp is the flamboyant,flaming,effeminate Capt. Jack Sparrow. His gender-bending performance was so controversial that Disney execs wanted Depp to tone it down,but he told them to take it or leave it. Sparrow embodies mischief, and flirts with both Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) Sparrow's duel with Turner is flirtatious,with the good captain jokingly calling Turner a eunuch. There's the sideplot of Elizabeth,a governor's daughter,being betrothed to a stuffy suitor in the Royal Navy,when Turner is her childhood sweetheart.The main plot involves Capt. Barbarossa (Rush), Sparrow's nemesis and captain of an undead crew. There are plot twists,a duel in a treasure-filled cave,and cliffhangers. Bloom shows his comedic side when he knocks himself out (literally).Orlando Bloom remembers the fangirls (and so does Johnny Depp),by having more chemistry with Depp than Knightley. Homoeroticism- and the potential for slash fiction- brings all the fangirls to the yard.""Curse of the Black Pearl"" is sometimes cursed with slowness,but overall it's a fun romp. Bloom proves himself as a comic actor,and that he's good at playing ditzy,but noble men (like Legolas) Depp brings Sparrow to life as a flighty pirate who likes a good bottle of rum. ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a wild ride."	3.0	A pearl in Disney's oyster	2007-11-16	1	0	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3LUUF8CAWLPHX	"Amazon Customer ""bluejaye"""	What inspires a person to create? Unfortunately, one of the answers is a DisneyWorld ride. Previously, the shamelessness of Hollywood has produced prequels, sequels, movies based on books, movies based on movies (the remake!), movies based on television shows, movies based on comic books, and movies based on video games. Now we have movies based on rides. And if you think Pirates of the Caribbean is just a flash in the pan, make-way for the upcoming Haunted Mansion. Remarkable that the most expensive artistic medium would be so lacking in inspiration. Well, perhaps it's our own fault for going to see these movies.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl does not disprove my theory that a movie with a really long title can't be that good. Fortunately for Gore Verbinski, he's got a great cast. Legolas, otherwise known as Orlando Bloom, Johnny Dep, and Geoffrey Rush do some serious scene chewing. Johnny Dep's crazy drunken Captain Jack Sparrow is the sole salvation of the film. Verbinski wasn't so lucky with previous outings like The Mexican. A great cast couldn't save that one. This one, however, goes in knowing it's dumb. It's a pirate movie. It's a ghost pirate movie. It's based on a Disney ride. Anyone expecting anything but silly lines and dramatic musical crescendos has got some serious expectation problems. As for the plot... yo, ho, ho... it doesn't really matter. We see zombies cross-dress! and zombies walk under water. What more do you want from a pirate movie? Oh... some of you do want more? Well, maybe you should let this one entertain the thirteen to fourteen year old audiences it was intended for. Otherwise, its a fun enough way to spend a few meaningless hours.	3.0	Seasick?	2003-07-11	15	3	12

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2ECY4R6UANCX4	Amazon Customer	This movie was so much fun!  It had a great balance of comedy, action and romance-much like an Indiana Jones movie, but with more of everything.  And you couldn't ask for three more beautiful people to play the leading roles (Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly) and the stuntwork and effects were fantastic.  The whole crew went through a lot to make this movie.  They actually built the ships and filmed many scenes miles from shore in the Caribbean.  The story is interesting enough to attract adults, but lighthearted enough for younger viewers.  I would not recommend this movie for kids under 8 or 9, though, especially if they are prone to nightmares.  There were some scenes that would be too frightening or disturbing for some children.  However, although it is rated PG-13, the violence is not too intense (it is a Disney movie, after all) and much of the violence is implied or takes place just off-screen.  Based on an interpretation of the ride, the story is action-filled and charming at the same time.  Anyone who enjoyed the ride at Disneyland will enjoy this movie and will recognize some of the subtle humor in tribute to it.  The movie does seem to leave the ending open for a sequel (I can't wait already!) but not in a way that leaves you hanging or disappointed. All in all, this movie will spark up your childhood fantasies and is a lot of great fun for (most of) the family. A definite must-see in the theatre!	5.0	Saw opening night!

Though they have put out many &quot;real&quot; films before, none can possibly compare to this particular piece of art. A tad bit roguish, with just a dash of vulgarity, yet a simple classic tale make this the best pirate movie to ever appear on the market, despite the doubts that a pirate movie could ever amount to anything. Johnny Depp leads the cast, of course, with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley making stunning performances as well.

This movie is very entertaining and definitely one worth owning.  The script was well written with lots of twists and turns and surprises.  The general premise that it is based upon a ride at Disneyland at first caused me to think it would be sort of cheesy and made for the ten and under crowd, but that impression was wrong.The heroine is beautiful and smart and not a just  one dimensional eye candy, while the two hero's, one a pirate captain and the other a reluctant pirate, are both multidimensional and fun to watch.  In a way this is a coming of age story about a young blacksmith that has a past he doesn't realize and a longing for a woman he can't have.The acting is good and the action smooth, this is a high recommendation for a thrill ride of a movie.	5.0	Join the crowd	2003-12-06	3	2	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3P2R1WF7A03V1	"Amazon Customer ""NJ Review Guy"""	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl finally breaks the curse of the bad pirate movie.  Most are unforgettable and justly so.  Pirates of Penzance?  Hook?  Ice Pirates?  Are there any fans of these films? I guess so.  But nobody is waiting in line for a sequel anytime soon.  So for Disney, to have a definite franchise made with this first outing, is something pretty special and a tribute to everyone involved in the film.What makes it work?  It's the characters and story.  The action, while being spectacular is secondary and supports the intriguing story and loveable characters.  Depp's Jack Sparrow is an instant, quirky classic and Geoffrey Rush's obsessed and bitter foe is almost as fun.  Heck, even the monkey is better than most characters from lesser Pirate movies!  What might be most compelling is that these are not gleeful, happy go lucky pirates that we always see in movies. They are broken men in every sense and their appetite for treasure and booty is what has cursed them into the pitiful eternally sailing zombies they've become.There's the notion that once a film offers up characters to love, the audience will follow those characters anywhere, because they care about them.  With Pirates of the Caribbean, we'll gladly follow them anywhere, under any sail and travelling in calm or rough waters alike.Cheers, Matey!	5.0	Finally, a Pirate Movie that works - on every level.	2006-07-30	2	2	0

I thought it to be a film which could have been rated PG, but that's not my area to judge.  Anyhow, Pirates of the Carribbean, starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and the beautiful Keira Knightley is an adventurous film full of fun and laughs.The infamous pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), seeks to steal back his ship, The Black Pearl, in which he was overthrown and deserted on an island from the time before.  Sparrow's encounter with the British that looked to be his end, soon turned to be his ticket to redemption.  The pirates who sail the Black Pearl are cursed with a spell that makes them immortal, but full of suffering.  Wil Turner (Orlando Bloom) becomes the key to everyone's fate, as he joins Captain Jack Sparrow in a quest to rescue his love, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley).Gore Verbinski, director, does a marvelous job directing this movie and deserves recognition.  The film was well presented and easy to view.  Truly a film I would recommend for anyone, even as a family movie.  One of the year's BEST films overall!	5.0	ARGH ME MATEY!

You get pulled right into the movie and you go on every adventure with Jack, Will, Elizabeth and Barbossa. I never saw it in theathers because I never heard of it til it came out.

M Robertson ""brother_entropy"""	I went into this movie expecting a lot more, and as obvious from my title on the review, didn't get it.It is a good family movie, but for the most part fails on many other levels.First off there is orlando bloom, who just doesn't work as the honorable man looking to avenge his father.  Even with a beard he just looks fragile, and his expressions range from confused to annoyed.Johnny Depp is decent as Captain Jack Sparrow, but his character is overdone.  He comes off as silly a lot of the time.  I know his character is supposed to be a bit warped, but there is a limit.  Take away the silly walk and tone down the goofy facial expressions and it might have worked.A lot of the bad guys, antiheroes, and costars were plain and simply dull.  The british naval officer lacked depth, the pirates were cardboard cutouts, and the female heroine, though a tough character just wasn't very intersting(a noblewoman who didn't want to be about sums it up), and the brilliant Geoffery Rush was wasted as the two dimensional pirate captain.The movie had some interesting cinematography, but the action sequences were poorly filmed.  They were either too close to see what is going on or poorly angled, and there is a lot of them.  One of my friends referred to it as &quot;the pirate fight movie&quot;.If you want something to keep the kids entertained, use this movie.  If you want something for anyone over the age of 16, then find something meatier.

The whole movie turned out to be the longest bore I sat through this summer.  All the sword fights were so incredibly dull and tedious that I wish they were taken out and replaced simply with Johnny Deppcharacter monologue.  At least there is one character that is funny, alas 1 star.Aside from the Captain Sparrow there were no exciting characters in this mindless popcorn flick.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2K3L0DOPQQ697	"Andrew Olson ""otaku"""	"Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a rogue pirate. He was exiled from his crew and left on an island. Jack managed to escape the island and is now looking for revenge and wants his ship back. Jack's former crew invade the town of Port Royal looking for a medallion that could rid them of their curse. They kidnap Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and her childhood friend, Will (Orlando Bloom), sets out to rescue her with the help of Jack Sparrow.Pirates of the Caribbean is the big-budget adaptation of a theme park ride, starring actors you wouldn't think of being in a blockbuster. But, despite all that Pirates of the Caribbean is a marvellous success. It stole the spotlight off the Matrix Reloaded to become the Summer's (2003) 2nd biggest movie after Finding Nemo.But how did it do it? Well, it was largely helped by the fantastic cast. Orlando Bloom pulled in the girls, Keira Knightley the boys, and Geoffrey Rush appeared to be hugely enjoying his role as a gold-hungry pirate. But it was mainly down to Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow, a Keith Richards style, rum-drinking, roguish yet charming pirate with a mind for gold. The role is superbly over-acted, and was the most memorable character of 2003, (Johnny Depp was robbed of an Oscar!).Also, Pirates of the Caribbean was fun. It was a truly exciting, thrilling film with plenty twists and turns. The action was very well choreographed. Pirates features some very good action sequences especially, Jack and Will's first encounter, several boat fights and the finale.Pirates of the Caribbean is very much a comedy. Jack Sparrow provides a lot of belly laughs especially in the rum scene with Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth Swann turns to Jack in disgust when she finds that when he was marooned on an island the previous time, all he did was drink rum for 3 days.""You sat on a beach for three days drinking rum?!"" - Elizabeth Swann. Jack Sparrow pauses then says; ""Welcome to the Caribbean, love!"" and then totters off. A classic scene.Also making laughs are The Office's Mackenzie Crook as a wooden-eyed pirate Ragetti and two bumbling navy officers.There are many small references to the ride that inspired the movie. In Johnny Depp's jail scene, a dog carrying the keys can be seen. In the drunken town of Tortuga, there are drunkards sitting on a swinging barrel. On a boat scene the parrot can be heard croaking `dead man tell no tales' a line relating to the ride. Rating out of 10 : 10, In a year, when comic book films and sequels dominated, Pirates of the Caribbean was a breath of fresh air. Johnny Depp steals the show and two sequels are now in production (Dead Man's Chest, already released, and At World's End, to be released in 2007)."	5.0	johnny depp does the flying spaghetti monster proud	2006-10-17	4	3	1

After all, look at ""The Country Bears"", although personally, I don't think the attraction was that good to begin with.  So you can imagine my surprise when I not only liked, but actually enjoyed ""Curse of the Black Pearl"".  The story goes that Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johhny Depp) was the captai of the Black Pearl, the most feared pirate ship in history, until his first mate Barbosa (Geoffry Rush) mutinied and kicked Sparrow off.  This was right before they stole some Aztec gold that puts a curse on whoever takes it.  In order to remove the curse, the pirates must return every last dubbloon.  The only one left is in the hands of Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightly), the daughter of a governor.  When the pirates kidnap her, her friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the son of a notorious pirate, enlists Sparrow's help in saving her.  Along the way, they have to escape the Royal Navy and avoid the pirates.  The action is magnificent especially since there are many good swordfights (gunfights are overrated) and all of the actors (except maybe Bloom) play their characters very convincingly.  My favorite performance had to be Depp; he did a great job with Sparrow, who is slightly insane from being in the Carribean sun for too long.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A287OFI6IQKTF1	Angela	"The phrase ""never a dull moment"" can truly be applied to Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean. In the quiet town of Port Royal, Elizabeth Swan (played by Kiera Knightley of ""Bend It Like Beckham"") is a girl longing for adventure, love, or possibly just freedom from her corset. When Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp of ""Sleepy Hollow"") swings into Port Royal, it seems she has finally found the sense of adventure she was hoping for; however, Jack causes a little too much trouble with the authorities and ends up in jail. Soon after, the town is blown off the map when the Black Pearl arrives and its crew captures Elizabeth, who holds one of their trinkets. Will Turner, a friend and local blacksmith (played by Orlando Bloom, ""Black Hawk Down"", ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Fellowship of the Ring"") realizes that she is gone and lets Jack out of jail for help with a search-and-rescue mission. The plot blooms as Jack seeks revenge against his first mate who betrayed him, Will finds out the peculiar traits that run in his blood-line, and Elizabeth holds out while kicking [butt] against the cursed pirates of the Black Pearl. Each scene is packed with action, accented by lively swordfights, special effects, and Klaus Badelt's riveting original score. While watching the movie, it is easy to forget that the folks at Disney actually made it- there's hardly a corny joke or campy scene in sight. Trust us, by the time you're halfway in, you'll be singing along: ""Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me."""	5.0	Never a Dull Moment	2003-07-13	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AK6UVFSU07NXH	Anthony Hinde	I actually went on the Pirate&#8217;s of the Caribbean ride at Disney Land as a kid. And apart from a few scenes, (especially on the extended DVD version), there&#8217;s only a vague derivation between the ride and the film. To be honest, the film is much better.Johnny Depp steals the show as the down-on-his-luck pirate captain, Jack Sparrow. A lot has been made of his bizarre take on this character, supposedly based on Keith Richard&#8217;s drug induced eccentricities. What he has created is a complex and intelligent soul, who also manages to lighten every scene in which he appears. Jack assumes a mentoring role for the young Will Turner, (Orlando Bloom), after they discover a shared desire to track down the legendary pirate ship, the Black Pearl.Orlando performs well, successfully capitalising on his newly earned reputation from The Lord of the Rings. Will Turner may not get many of the good lines but he make a good fist of what he gets. As does Keira Knightley in her role as the Governor&#8217;s daughter and Will&#8217;s love interest. Her role is fairly predictable; an atavistic modern woman plopped into the eighteen hundreds.The production values for this film are truly excellent and have been transferred flawlessly to DVD. The film&#8217;s special effects are very necessary to the plot, showing cursed pirates transforming into cadavers once in moonlight. These effects are both impressive and seamless. The DVD special features goes to quite some length to explain the creating of these images; maybe not ground breaking but interesting none the less.All in all the film makes for a solid base which should support a long-running series of sequels/prequels. So long as they manage to keep the film&#8217;s sense of humour I feel it&#8217;s a formula that should continue to prove entertaining. &#8220;The Curse of the Black Pearl&#8221; is a wonderful stand-alone experience but I for one will enjoy seeing Jack, Will and Miss Swan taking on their next challenge.	4.0	Long live the Swash-Buckler	2004-02-16	1	1	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A13H2JJ3GEMJN1	"AntiochAndy ""antiochandy"""	PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is one of 2003's most popular movies -- and rightfully so. It's a swashbuckling tale in true Errol Flynn tradition. If there's a negative, it is that maybe there's too much action. That's a pretty pale complaint. The story is fun and entertaining, the settings are elaborate, the scenery beautiful, and the players are excellent. Much has been written and said about Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, and justifiably so. His off-beat interpretation is brilliant and he gets a lot of great lines to go with it. There are a lot of other fine performances here besides Depp's, though, from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley right on down through the lesser roles. Perhaps my favorite is Geoffrey Rush as the evil Captain Barbossa. Rush brings a delightfully nasty swagger to the part, pulls off the most dramatic scene of the tale well, and also delivers some witty dialogue with a distinct flair.The package also has a second disc packed with extra material. I'm not a big fan of all the extra &quot;special features&quot; packed with movie DVDs. Generally, if I want the movie, I get it. If I don't, I don't. The special features are just extra freight. I've watched most of this second disc, though, and it's worth the extra time and trouble. Of particular interest was the footage of Walt Disney discussing the original concept behind the Disneyland &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; ride and the following trip through it. I remember seeing this material when it originally aired on TV back in 1968 and it was a joy to see it again. Mr. Disney's enthusiasm for this last creation of his is evident. It's also interesting to note the original sets -- some have since been changed in subtle ways over the years to make them more politically correct for today's delicate sensibilities (HA!).The PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 2-disc collector's edition is a terrific package. You get a great movie plus some really worthwhile &quot;special features&quot; to go along with it. You can't miss. It's fun for all and gets my highest recommendation.	5.0	You Might've Deserved This One	2003-12-17	4	3	1

First, WILL TURNER KILLS HIS FATHER. his father was under the curse along with the rest of the pirates who had taken the gold, and so, tho tied to a cannon at the bottom of the sea, he was not dead because, (like the pirates who walked on their way along the ocean floor) he couldn't drown. That is, not until Will put the last blood-stained pieces into the chest. Then his father, and all the other pirates turned back into humans, and only then would his father have drowned.The second problem is how the gold pieces were stained with the blood of all those who had taken it in the first place. those who had taken the gold were turned in to skeleton beings. well, if you noticed during the duration of the movie, when they are stabbed, chopped up, and so on, the SKELETONS DON'T BLEED! so how did Jack Sparrow manage to bleed on his coin when he was a skeleton? or all the other pirates for that matter? can they bleed at will?I really wonder...maybe there are answers to these problems somewhere on the cutting room floor, or maybe they thought we just wouldn&#65533;t notice...Anyway, I really liked the movie and all, but it just can't compare to the literary level of the movies based on Tolkein's books...	5.0	Great movie, but here are the bloopers...	2003-10-08	16	1	15

When I first heard they were making a movie based on a theme park ride I could only imagine how bad this could get. Instead, I'm treated to a wonderful adventure that never takes itself too seriously. This has become one of my favorite movies of the past decade.The movie succeeds on many levels. The four main characters, Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow (Pirate), Orlando Bloom as Will Turner (Blacksmith and son of pirate) Kiera Knightly as Elizabeth Swann (Daughter of Governor) and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa(Evil Pirate), are perfectly cast. Over and over I'm amazed with the acting of Johnny Depp. He is able to take a character and make it his own. Orlando Bloom surprizes as he makes you forget he played Legolas in Lord of the Rings. Geoffrey Rush absolutely steals every scene he's in. And of course Kiera Knightly plays off each character perfectly.The Plot is creative and original, with MANY surprizes. The musical score soars. Even the supporting roles are interesting and well developed.The DVD has two discs. The second is the extra features which are overall good. I thought the blooper reel was cute, but not as good as it could have been. It also has the original &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; featurette that had Walt Disney introducing the ride at Disneyland.There are MANY things to enjoy here.

I would diffently go see it if I were you.  Though the movie might seem a little corny on the effects part, it's still a fantastic and chilling movie. The reason I rate it 5 stars is because it should be rated that. I went and saw it and I enjoyed it very very very much. I thought it was so funny! The movie stars Johnny depp and Orlando bloom are awsome for this movie! I love this movie it was every boys dream to be a pirate says Orlando bloom who is a blacksmith (Will turner) in the movie. Also Johnny depp says that he enjoyed being in the movie very much, he says that it was like he already knew the part of the worsest pirate ever (captain Jack Sarrow). Geoffrey Rush said that he really had a great time working with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. He said that he thought the movie would be easy to do but unfortunally he says it wasn't! But in the end everyone put on the most exciting movie ever!

My closest friends have the DVD, and saw it in theaters 13 times.  Yes, 13.  I saw it twice in theaters, I was dragged persay, and I found it unbearable to get through the second time.  At first, I wasn't real into seeing a movie of pirates.  It just isn't my thing.  People said the movie was humorous, but really I didn't get any of the humor in the movie.  The best part was the end with the monkey at the rolling credit.  However, according to my friends it was one of the best movies of the  year, so don't take my opinion for it.  My friend has her brain into writing fan fictions of pirates.  I don't know if the movie was so wonderful because of the hunkalicious Johnny Depp, who I don't find very handsome, or what.  However, the actors did a good job, Johnny and Orlando, and any female will start drooling over the presence of these two males.  I didn't though.  They just aren't my type.	2.0	But, where's the rum?	2004-02-01	16	3	13
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AMCUKPN0K2VMR	Ashley Figley	This film is fun and so full of adventure!  I'm confused though, is Johnny Depp playing pirate Captain Jack Sparrow or is he doing his best Keith Richards impression?  Whichever may be the case, I still thought Johnny Depp's character was witty, clever, and entertaining.  Another Hollywood veteran, the brilliant Geoffrey Rush, was the antagonist of the story.  I honestly didn't think he was a very convincing villain in this role, sort of a Freddy Kruegeresque-this-villian-isn't-too-scary-because-he-has-too-many-one-liners.Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) and Keira Knightley (Bend it Like Beckham) are absolutely riveting young actors.  It is a breath of fresh air to see Bloom's talents in a role that doesn't include being a long-haired blonde elf.  He also, predictably, gets the girl (Knightley) at the end -- not before learning that his father was a pirate, sword-fighting with the likes of the cursed men of the Black Pearl, and saving his distressed damsel.  But this damsel is not helpless.  Knightley plays a very strong-willed young woman who doesn't just sit back and wait for things to happen.  She has one of the most frightful screams I have ever heard, very convincing.  She is definitely her own person, and follows her conscience and heart and not convenience.  But aren't they all like that in movies?This movie is thoroughly predictable, but it was very fun.  If you like adventure and a little ridiculousness, you'll like this film.

You just can't help grinning though out the movie at some of his antics.Orlando Bloom is one of the better younger actors out there today, with real talent.  His portrayal as Will Turner, the long unnoticed blacksmith, who gets Sparrow to help save his bonny lass, Elizabeth is outstanding to say the least.Geoffrey Rush as villain Captain Barboss and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann round off the cast and make this movie one that you will want to watch again and again.

Though at times Depp's rendering seemed way over the top, in the end it proved that it could be no other way.  In fact his keystone cop escapes and totally improbable machinations saved every situation, and kept the overall story from being trite.Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley made perfect lovers, however generic, by simply being Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.  It was their spirited entry into the mad world of Jack Sparrow that raised their situation from one of bathos to that of high adventure.The upside down world created by the authors of the script managed to make pirates of us all by juxtaposing our rather dogmatic assumption that ""authority"" is always right or has a higher reason to be that benefits us all against our assumption that resistance to authority is ""wrong"" and a threat to us all.  In fact, if taken from a purely philosophical perspective, neither proposition is absolutely correct.  Taking either conformity or rebellion to extremes has proved devastating to society.An interesting and entertaining film."	5.0	Delightful insanity	2010-11-26	0	0	0

Taking place in the beautiful Caribbean Sea and Islands, you couldn't ask for a better setting.Johnny Depp stole the show as the morally ambiguous and off-kilter Captain Jack Sparrow. Though he seemed a little addled, there was always a method to his madness and quickly became my favorite character in the movie.Geoffrey Rush made an excellent villain as the treacherous pirate Barbossa. ... That's the best kind of villain too. You just love to hate him.Orlando Bloom played Will Turner, the archetypal poor boy and would-be hero. The refreshing thing about Mr. Bloom is that unlike so many other pretty boys in the entertainment industry these days, he seems to be one of the few with any real talent.And Keira Knightly was a great leading lady as Elizabeth Swann. In an era of no-talent divas like J-Lo thinking they can act, I always feel better when real actresses appear in real movies. I hear Miss Knightly will be playing Guinivere in an Arthurian movie next year, and I look forward to seeing that.Combine with great writing, breath-taking scenery, and an adundance of action mixed with just the right amount of humor, and you've got a damn good movie in my opinion.

"""Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is great fun. It has romance, action, sword fighting, ghost pirates, great bad guys, great good guys, ships on fire, and secret treasure. It is funny, exciting and satifying. What more could you want in a movie?Reminding viewers of every pirate movie they have ever seen, from ""Captain Kidd, ""Captain Blood"" and even ""Princess Bride.""The personality of ""Princess Bride""'s great Spanish swordsman Inigo Montoya shows up in the character of Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp. With the flavor of Dudley Moore's ""Arthur,"" Capt. Jack is almost sober, and always ready with a subtle quip.In dashing good pirate fashion, the movie is about saving a damsel in distress. Keira Knightley plays the damsel, Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of the governor. Chased by the governor and his navy, and in the hands of bad ghost pirates, conflict and swordplay surround many scenes in freshly choreographed duels.Fans of the ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" will enjoy a scene when the ghost pirates are walking on the ocean floor. It reminded me of the ""Army of the Dead"" charging to fight.It is a pure, family movie. The youngest children might find some scenes too violent, but older children will love this battle of good and evil.I would have liked to understand more behind Capt. Jack's background, and more character development of Will Turner (played by played by Orlando Bloom). This is not because the movie is lacking, but because of how invested I felt in each character.

This is a really fun, fairly light-hearted movie that will definitely have you walking out of the theater with a smile on your face.I would recommend this film to anyone over the age of 10. It is rated PG-13, I feel, mainly because of the final battle scene where you hear necks snap and see bodies fall to the ground.

It has romance, comedy, adventure, action, suspense, horror, sword-fighting, chases, supernatural events, skeletons, treasure, cannons, guns, pirate ships, terrific actors, incredible special effects, an exciting soundtrack, and an outstanding story. But the thing that you must realize is this: You will walk away from seeing this movie and be completely smitten with Jack Sparrow. It's unavoidable. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Jack is perfect. How did he ever come up with it? Jack is a cross between Keith Richards and Pepe Le Pew, has gold teeth and black eyeliner, and is just an unbelievably odd pirate...It's amazing when you think about it: millions of people have fallen in love with one man because of one movie.

Johnny Depp, who excels at playing oddball characters, really took ahold of Captain Jack Sparrow. Sexy, yet clever, driven, but with heart, Depp took what could have been a very boring lead and made it into a stellar performance.Orlando Bloom was also equally likable but he has some quirks in his charater. He didn't have much depth and his best scenes involve swordplay. Miss Kingsley played her part well though she also lacked character depth. All in all, the movie was great. The first action sequence when the Black Pearl enters the harbor blew me away. I think this film went above the action genre.Geoffery Rush and the other pirates added humor but also kept the movie slightly dark. I expected some cheesy acting and even cheesier graphics, but Disney hit a gold mine with Pirates of the Caribbean, I think everyone was a little shocked at how the movie turned out, and it turned out to be awesome.	4.0	Unexpected greatness	2003-10-09	2	1	1

This  tale teams a young man, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), with an unlikely ally in rogue pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together, they must battle a band of the world's most treacherous pirates, led by the cursed Captain Barbossa, in order to save Elizabeth, the love of Will's life, as well as recover the lost treasure that Jack seeks. Against improbable odds, they race towards a thrilling, climactic confrontation on the mysterious Isla de Muerta. Clashing their swords in fiece mortal combat, Will and Jack attempt to recapture The Black Pearl ship, save the British navy and relinquish a fortune in forbidden treasure thereby lifting the curse of the Pirates of the Caribbean.Very few movies I've seen deserve 5 stars; if I could, I'd gives this movie more.  It has been ages since I've seen Johnny Depp in anything, and he played Capt. Jack Sparrow extremely well.  The attention to detail in this movie was amazing!

Pirates of the Carribean offers non stop action with great special effects, wonderful actors, and a good storyline that keeps you interested throughout the 2 and 1/2 hours that it runs.

Together they set out to rescue Will's kidnapped girlfriend Elizabeth and gain control over Jack's ship, the BLACK PEARL, which was stolen from him by his mutinous first mate, Barbossa (Geoffery Rush)and his ghostly crew, all cursed by ancient stolen treasure.

Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley get involved with this madcap pirate from having once been rather respectable.  The Black Pearl is Jack's ship, but the curse?  Ah, that's complicated.I am madly in lust -- er, in love with Johnny Depp. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are also very charming and seductive. So in addition to great photography and special effects and great settings and all of the rest, there's a baser stimulation to watching these healthy young bodies go running around and jumping in the ocean and all the rest.Fine. There's also some incredible special effects, one heck of a good story, Captain Jack's off-beat but delightful -- no, make that off-beat AND delightful sense of humor, the stimulation of lots of fast action, and not all that much blood. After all, most of the people who get run through with swords are already dead.Yes, my bias due to Johnny Depp is involved here, but I still have no hesitation in giving this one a full five stars.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ	"Barry ""Barrybgb"""	"When was the last time you saw a summer movie that was actually worthy of being a summer movie blockbuster?. It's been a while. For me anyways. Not anymore. This was one of the funnest summery type extravaganzas I have seen in a while. The movie is not a typical Disney film. In fact, the famous logo doesn't even appear at the beginning of the movie. The title barely appears at the beginning either. Pirate movies are not what one would call heavy hitters at the box office. They don't have a great track record. That's because they didn't know how to make a really great one. The ride was very special and nostalgic for me, so this whole movie was something pretty sweet. Johnny Depp stars as Captain Jack Sparrow. He is a pirate captain without a ship. It would be more fun to find out how he lost it, than for me to tell you. He enters the small sea town of Port Royal, and his entrance is a classic. Funny and memorable. The film starts off with a little girl named Elizabeth Swan, who witnesses her father, The Governor, and his men pull up a small boy floating on the water. Little Elizabeth takes his pirate necklace that he is wearing. We flash forward 8 years to a more grown Elizabeth, who is played by the strikingly beautiful Keira Knightley. The little boy, Will Turner, has grown up to be a blacksmith, and is played by Orlando Bloom. Jack wants to take back his ship, The Black Pearl, which was taken over by Captain Barbossa and his crew. Barbossa and his men are inflicted by a horribe curse that has them lost between life and death. They are not dead, but they are not exactly alive either. They turn into skeletons at night when they are in the moonlight. They also can't feel, drink, eat, or basically do anything. Jack and Will, enemies at first, team up to get Jack back his ship, and to rescue Elizabeth, who has fallen into the hands of Barbossa after having the last piece they need to break free of the curse. Disney's latest attempts to turn their rides into films hasn't worked. This one does. This has kiddie appeal, but it's also an adult film as well. Director Gore Verbinski, who directed ""The Ring"", gives the film the look and feel that it needs. The murky waters, the sinister caves, and all of that stuff. Depp is a genius. His choices of odd, quirky characters have made him greatly admired and respected in the world of acting with fans and Hollywood insiders alike. He is the most versatile actor of his time. His Jack Sparrow is one for the books. It's hard to describe him. He's an instant classic screen character of indestructible presence. One wonders where Johnny came up with his take on the character, but we are glad that he did it. You've never seen anything like it. He gives into the role and makes it real. He IS this movie. He rules every scene he is in and the film doesn't have the punch whenever he isn't in it. Some wish Depp would try 'normal' things for a change. I ask this - why?. Who would want that?. Why change what you are so brilliant at?. Why change what has given you so much respect in the industry?. If you are not a Depp fan, (and if your not then what's wrong with you?!?!?!), you will be after this movie. Orlando is a solid enough actor, but there isn't much difference with his character and many others we have seen. He is the straight man, and he does just fine. When he is on screen with Johnny, we see how much more he has to learn. Geoffrey Rush is Barbossa. He seems to be the only other one here, besides Depp, who seems to really jump into the role and play it to the hilt. He is a lot of fun. Knightley is just a beautiful girl. She was solid in the film, if nothing spectacular, but she was a real delight to look at. The only other familiar face here is Jonathan Pryce, who plays Governor Swan. The script is clever and sharp and has many jokes throughout. These are the same people who wrote ""Shrek"", so you know the film will be peppered with a nice dose of respectable and laughable humor. It is. The effects were very good. I wished there were more scenes with the skeletons, but oh well. They were incredibly done. Amazing to look at. The score was another great accomplishment. However, the movie gets bogged down due to an overlong running time. It really zips by, but then the second half kicks in and parts drag on a bit. It wouldn't of hurt to snip a few parts out. You will also notice some nods to the amusement ride at Disneyland too. The movie knows what it is and knows what it has to do in order to succeed and entertain. It does it incredibly well. It's the type of movie that fun, summery type movies were created for. I wish they were all this cool. It's swashbuckling fun with sword fights, action, special effects, romance, and one heck of a scene stealing performance from Depp. You need to see this!!."	5.0	"""The Pirate's Life For Me...."""	2003-07-13	2	2	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A351XMJF8DCD8Z	"bart ""wwfrockfan"""	Pirates of the Carribean was probobly one of the best films that released during suumer 2003.  I personally think that S.W.A.T. was the bets movie of the summer, but this is still good.  I was really amazed that this movie had great action, load of laughs, and that its from Disney!  That is one of the reasons I almost never saw this movie is because it was released Disney, a company that usually makes fantasy stories for 4 yr olds.  I was really surprised that there were so many kids that said how much of a great movie this was which made consider about seeing it.  I was also surprised that this movie was in theaters for sucha long a time.  I saw this movie the day after Halloween (and it had been in theaters since July) and I can clearly see why it was so good.  I definetly want to own this movie.  Enough about that here is the plot.Many years ago a group of Pirate who have a ship called the Black Pearl discovered a treasure that leads back to the aztec ruler Hernan Cortez.  They all took it and sold it off but what they didn't realise was that when they took the gold, they became cursed.  To them; food taste like ash, they cannot die, they become skelatons when they walk into the moonlight.  Now their on a quest to end their curse by finding all the gold they had tooken.  Many years later they have found almost every piece of gold except one.  That one piece is with the daughter of a governor, Elizabeth (Keira Knightly).  They kidnapp her because they need the gold and they need her blood to help end the curse.  What they do not know is that the gold doesn't actually belong to her, it belongs to a friend of her's, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a tailor who is secretly in love with her.  It is actually Will's blood that is needed to end the curse and the pirates do not know that nor does Will.  Will goes on a quest to rescue Elizabeth by enlisting the help of a Pirate, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp).  As they go on their rescue adventure, we learn some hisory about jack.  We learn that the Black Pearl was at one time under Jack's control and the the current captain, Barbosa (Geoffery Rush) had turned on him so he can get control of the ship.  Jack is out there to help WIll, but mainly to kill Barbosa and once regain his ship.Overall Pirates of the Carribean was a great film.  Even I can admit, that I was clearly wrong about this movie when it first came out.  It is fun overseas adventure and is filled witth moments that will make you laugh.  I definetly want to own this one day cuz it is a film the whole family will enjoy.	5.0	Amazing, exhilerating, and at times quite funny!!!!!!!!!!!!	2004-03-28	6	2	4
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1L6WQAM456UCC	"Batcaveakron ""Mike"""	It goes without saying that Johnny Depp has created an unforgetable movie character the likes of Indiana Jones and Hannibal Lector.  To try to analyze this movie and discuss it's virtue is like trying to decide why steak is good.  It's pure unadulterated escapism and honest fun.  A robust adventure with everything you could ask for in an adventure movie.I did not think that Blue-Ray could be that much better than the outstanding quality of DVD on a hi def, 1080p LCD television, but....I was wrong.  The Blue-Ray version is impressive, to say the least.  Color density and quality are without equal.  Because of it's grand scale of scenery, action and music, Blue-Ray is the way to go for this one.	5.0	A PEARL TO BE CERTAIN	2009-02-20	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AR37967IAR6ZT	Benjamin	"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL was, by far, the most jolly good fun I've had at a summer blockbuster in ages. And it may be the best movie based on a theme park ride featuring Zoe Saldana, a midget and the ghost of a pet monkey that I've ever seen. Johnny Depp is absolutely brilliant in his part, as well, playing Capt. Jack Sparrow, a deranged pirate, as some sort of hung-over Jamaican drag queen coming off a monthlong bender. I've not seen overacting of this caliber since Al Pacino in THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE.But the movie is so drunk on its own lunacy that I had a great time.At the point when a talking toucan resting on a man's shoulder shouts out ""Shiver me timbers!,"" the movie essentially wins you over.It's easily 45 minutes too long. It's flawed. The ghost ""curse"" story doesn't make a damn bit of sense. (Why EXACTLY do they need, I kid you not, ""the blood of Bootstrap Bill?"") The swordfights, at first inventive, seem to go on and on forever. In addition to Saldana, Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport are also in it and given very little to do.But here's what you really need to know:Orlando Bloom is really cute. Depp is really funny. Keira Knightley is, essentially, a movie star. (She played Natalie Portman's body double in STAR WARS: EPISODE ONE, and now she's going to get all of the parts that Natalie Portman will turn down because they still look exactly alike.) The special effects are pretty good. Every pirate movie cliche that you've ever seen a million times before is redone. Nothing's serious (and the people expecting seriousness got annoyed at the movie). I want to see it again."	4.0	Shiver me timbers!	2003-07-10	3	2	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A31I3HXMD5H1EL	Benjamin J Burgraff	Now, I'll admit I loved PIRATES, but it is notwithout faults, the greatest being, IT'S TOO LONG! Will SOMEBODY tell JerryBruckheimer that a feature film doesn't HAVE to be over two hours andfifteen minutes long? A half hour trimmed would have tightened the plot,kept the audience jumping at the climaxes (and not for the bathroom), andincreased the revenue, as another showtime could be squeezed in each day.That being said, there is a lot to like about the film. A truly good piratemovie MUST obey certain guidelines: a swashbuckling hero, an equally strongdamsel, a truly dastardly villain, a great climactic duel, a romance, atleast one major sea battle and city plundering scene, LOTS of pirate lore,and respect for the time frame of the film (NO lapses into 20th or 21stcentury jargon or technology, for the sake of plot or humor). Hollywood'slast major pirate effort, CUTTHROAT ISLAND, had Gena Davis as a distaffhero, which was acceptable (Maureen O'Hara had played a swashbuckler inseveral 40s-50s films), and Frank Langella as the villain, which wasinspired casting...but Matthew Modine was so wimpish a leading man that theromance between him and Davis looked ridiculous, and Davis evolved into anear caricature, to fill the void...and the film descended into present-daycampiness, which was the kiss of death.Director Gore Verbinski, and writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, StuartBeattie, and Jay Wolpert clearly did their homework for PIRATES, andadmirably filled each pirate movie requirement. Two heroes swash their waythrough the film; Johnny Depp is the picturebook pirate, complete withoutrageous attire, a braided beard, eye makeup, a drunken swagger, and thebest damn' Keith Richards impersonation I've ever seen; Orlando Bloom is theheroic, Errol Flynn-like buccaneer, out to rescue his damsel, and full oflofty ideals. Eighteen-year-old Keira Knightley is the heroine, and whileher acting skills are average, at best, she shows a lot of spunk (andcleavage), and positively glows, onscreen. The villain is another inspiredpiece of casting; Geoffrey Rush, while not as menacing as Frank Langella,has a ball as the snarling yet world-weary Pirate leader. As for the piratecrews (there are two), they are perfect; you have guys with hooks and peglegs, barbarians straight out of MOBY DICK, even a parrot and a monkey assidekicks, all hankering for rum, riches, and victims to 'walk the plank'.That one crew is all cursed, and reveal themselves to be skeletal,decomposing corpses under the full moon only increases their nastyperfection!The film borrows heavily from THE CRIMSON PIRATE, TREASURE ISLAND,SWASHBUCKLER, Universal Pictures' 40s B-movie pirate flicks, and even a fewHammer horror features of the early 60s, but it all fits together fairlyseamlessly. Still, the excessive length would be a fatal flaw, were it notfor Johnny Depp's physical and verbal presense. He is the glue that holdseverything together, and he is VERY much up to the task! Whenever the filmstarts to drag, Depp has some bit of 'business' that is hilarious, and keepsthings rolling.I won't delve into the plot (cursed gold, kidnappings, a gallowsscene...pretty standard pirate stuff), but I will say that you could do aLOT worse than PIRATES in this season of overblown sequels and underwhelmingoriginals.Go to the bathroom before you go to the theater, and ENJOY!	4.0	A Swashbuckling Delight!	2003-08-03	0	0	0

She has an opportunity to save one. In the process, she pilfers what looks like a piece of pirate gold. This simple act will lead to death and destruction, or romance and intrigue.This well paced movie has every clich&eacute; ever spoken in the classic pirate movies. It also has all the elements, gold, and sub-plots, and is sure to point them out to you should you miss one.This is a well-designed movie with attempts to be authentic in many ways such as using real pistols from the era. There are several crews and you will notice that the extras change from one scene to the next. They did not skimp on the actors either. As with pirate movies of old, the main actors took the lion's share of the action.Of course, you will have your eye on Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), his cronies and adversaries. However I was surprised to see their good taste in giving Guy Siner the part of Harbormaster; you may remember him as Lieutenant Hubert Gruber in the series ""Allo 'Allo!"" (1982)There are no bones about it, this is superior to other Depp movies and will leave a good after taste. You may need to see it several times to pick up the tightly packed scenes and dialog. I have viewed the duel DVD package and found instead of just rehashing the movie scenes that they give different insights that you may have missed in the first viewing. Even the deleted scenes allow you to see the way the movie could have went.Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest (Widescreen Edition)"	4.0	Don't monkey around with Aztec gold.	2004-03-04	0	0	0

My main reason was because I am a die-hard Orlando Bloom fan. I think he's gorgeous! Keira Knightley is also great as an actress -- not to mention very beautiful. However, it is not just the looks of the actors in the show that make it worthwhile. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor, he really lights up the show. Orlando has broken out from his ""timid"" shell and shown his true colors as an actor. The whole cast works together to create a fantastic picture, full of action, romance, comedy, and suspense. I can't think of anything wrong with the film at all. I am 14 years old, and there is nothing wrong with the film that would make it unnacceptable for children. There is only one swear word the entire time...The only ""scary"" part that could shake children are the skeletons, which are not scary, really. And of course there is swordplay, it is about pirates! Costumes -- great! Everything looked like it was really set in the 17th century. The script was very well-written, and like I said before, the actors/actresses are truly phenomenal. I plan to see the movie again in a few days. Johnny Depp portrays the perfect mind-boggling pirate, and Orlando and Keira and the rest of the cast make you feel like you have experienced everything, as if you were there.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A417ZAKGXT9IN	Betty June Moore	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, based on the famous Disneyland ride, is an exciting, lighthearted epic of 18th Century pirates in the style of Errol Flynn's Captain Blood. It's a fast paced romp that mixes seafaring action, elements of the supernatural, slapstick comedy, and romance. It's not realistic, but thank goodness, it wasn't meant to be.The plot of the movie centers on a gold medallion (here we see echoes of the Indiana Jones movies) that has supernatural powers. It's being sought by Captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush) and his cursed crew of ghosts to lift the spell that has doomed them to sail the seas as undead. Chasing them to take back the ship Black Pearl is Captain Jack Sparrow ( Johnny Depp). He is eventually assisted in his quest by blacksmith and expert sword maker Will Turner (Orlando Bloom of Lord of the Rings fame) and governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley).Director Gore Verbinski (Mouse Hunt), working from a screen play by Shrek writers Stuart Beattie, Ted Elliot, Terry Rossio, and Jay Wolpert, gives audiences laughter, excitement, chills, thrills, and even antcipation of further Pirates of the Caribbean movies. For those moviegoers who've visited Disneyland or Disney World, there are several charming references to the ride; my favorite is when the pirates are chasing the women around the port. I broke out in laughter several times, and so did many in the audience. I also found the special effects by Industrial Light and Magic (the same people that do the special effects for Star Wars) are incredible, and the score by Klaus Badelt is lively and stirrring.For a late summer moviegoing season, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is definitely worth going to see.	5.0	If you miss this, you will be cursed...	2003-09-14	3	3	0

It features a woman who is given a necklace with a spooky looking embelem on it.  She does not know what the embelem is about, but some pirates looking for it, kidnap her when she refuses to return it to them.The pirates are both pirates &amp; ghosts.  I love the way they just effortlessly transform from human to bone.  I love how realistic &amp; spooky looking the pirates are when they are just bones.  The pirates are evil to the core, who don't care what they do to the girl or how cruelly they treat her.Johnny is hired in as a captain of a pirate ship to go out to sea to find her &amp; get her back.  The action is good enough to keep you on the edge of your seat for a long time.  The special effects are very well done, a little over the top at times, but not enough to really be a detriment to the movie.At 143 minutes (2 h 23 m) it is very long &amp; seems to move along slowly at times, but it is just building up steam &amp; momentum.  The fight scene with Johnny &amp; the pirates is great as well, never a dull moment, &amp; very well done.The DVD itself is really good as well, 2 discs with a boatload of bonus materials, especially commentaries, deleted scenes, &amp; extended scenes.  It would be nice to have a trailer on the DVD, though.I have seen the ride &amp; been on the ride at Disney World, the movie does a good job of protratying the ride &amp; translating it into a good movie.	5.0	Well worth the money I spent on it.	2004-02-24	4	4	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3AF8P0GINFADV	Black Barbie	Yes! Finally a pirate movie that captures the fun, swashbuckling aura that the Errol Flynn ones had.This film is a real gem. It is not trying to be an pseudo-epic film with heart-breaking emotion, it is a comedic, visually exciting in terms of graphics, and fast-paced film.This film focuses on the story of Cpt Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) wanting to retrieve his ship, the Black Pearl, from his so-called first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). However, it does not solely focus on Johnny Depp which I think was good. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters have their own interesting stories to tell.Positive Points: Stellar Cast! Depp, Bloom, Knightley, Rush and Davenport work very well together.Depp has proved him self to be a great actor with films like Edward Scissorhands but in this effort, he shows that he is versatile and doesn't take himself too seriously which is refreshing to see.Script is original and quite funny for the light-hearted.Brilliant DVD - especially the deleted scenes, blooper reel and the information on how the film was made.Negative Points: It is an enjoyable film but the only niggle I had was the minimal interaction between Sparrow and Elizabeth...Shame, they would have made a cute couple!	5.0	This film is wicked, savvy?	2004-01-05	3	2	1

I thought when I first saw the previews of Pirates that it would be good, but not one of the best movies I've seen, but that's just what it is. I enjoyed this movie all the way through and never lost interest. Johnny Depp was more than Awesome as was Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom. I thought that when I came out from seeing the movie that I would be in love with Orlando, but instead I love Johnny Depp. His costume and the way he talked and acted made the movie as funny as it is and if he hadn't been in it, it probably would have been a dud. But also Orlando makes it great and especially Keira, whom is the perfect ""damsel in distress"" with beautiful dresses, great character and an awesome attitude. Orlando played perfectly also, with his great swordsman ship with Johnny and how well they acted together. The movie was, as I've said, greater than Awesome and I for sure will go to the theatre again and again to see it until they either take it out or until they finally put it on DVD.I loved this movie and I recommend it to everyone.And I can't wait to have it on DVD!!!"	5.0	Pirates Rock!	2003-07-14	2	2	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A23J2BFYR06TNN	"""bloody_valentine29"""	Wow. I love this movie. I'd underline 'love' if I could. This movie is awesome. I mean it. I've spent so much money on it, it's unbelievable. (I've seen it five times, going again next week.) I've never liked a movie so much. I think it was a combination of the music, the actors/acting, the plot, and the fact that it was about pirates that really got me. In other words, I loved everything.The music is amazing. I've got the soundtrack and I usually don't like orchestral music but I love this stuff. The rhythm and pattern of the music is really exciting and it will get stuck in your head and you'll hum it all day. It's so cool.Johnny Depp shows how good of an actor he is, and how he can adapt to any role and really bring his character to life. Jack Sparrow seemed more real than any other movie character I've ever seen. He was hilarious. My friend and I spent the entire movie laughing. Orlando Bloom once again proves he can play roles with sword fighting and such. He's awesome. And I loved Captain Barbossa's crew. They were so funny.The plot was so cool. It was twisted enough that it kept you guessing, but made perfect sense at the end. And you can go and see POTC a million times, and every time you'll pick up on something you didn't notice before. It's so cool how that happens.All in all, I love this movie. It's definitely better than any other Disney movie ever made. I can wait for the DVD to come out. It's going to be worn out within a couple of weeks. If you haven't seen Pirates of the Caribbean yet, you now know some of what you're missing. It's impossible to put into words just how good this movie is, so I won't even try. You need to see this movie. There's something about it that gets you hooked on it.	5.0	I love it.	2003-09-16	10	9	1

The acting, the scenery, the costumes, the action - I can't say enough!  Johnny Depp was amazing as Captain Jack Sparrow.  I can't count how many times his character alone had me laughing.  And sorry, but even with the grungy beard and all, he was still hot!  Orlando Bloom was endearing as Will.  He was such a sweetheart.  A sweetheart with a very impressive sword arm but a sweetheart nonetheless.  Those two pieces of ""eye candy"" would have been enough for me to give the movie at least a 3 and 1/2 star rating.  Keira Knightley was great, too.  This was the first time I had heard of this young actress and was impressed with what I saw.I was going to take my two oldest children, ages 8 and 6, to see this film but decided against it at the last minute because I thought that the scenes of the ""ghostly crew"" would be too scary for them.  I now wish I would've taken them because although the special effects were dynamic - I don't think any of the scenes shown would have kept the kiddies awake at night, clutching the bedsheets, while waiting for the ""scary pirate monsters"" to jump out of the closet. : PI can't wait for the dvd to come out - this movie is a great and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy watching together!"	5.0	Great Movie!!!	2003-10-26	3	3	0

Munoz	First off, being the thirteen year old girl that I am, Johnny Depp is totally hot, and Orlando Bloom isn't too bad looking himself. Good . Got that out of the way.  This movie is about more than just hotness though. It is one of the best movies that Disney ever made. The special effects are dazzling, and you really feel like you are in the pirate ship yourself somewhere in the Caribbean. And Johnny Depp makes the perfect pirate. The acting is great. Disney considered replacing him, and they're probably thanking their lucky stars right now that they didn't or else the film just wouldn't be the same blockbuster that it was. Too bad it didn't win any Oscars on Sunday, stupid Lord of the Rings, every category that Pirates was nominated, so was LOTR and guess who won. Personally, I think the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney is one of the worst rides ever, blech, incredibly boring, but the same cannot be said for the movie, definitely one of my favorites	5.0	Johnny Depp rocks!!!!!	2004-03-02	5	4	1

If you're a fan of the old Errol Flynn pirate flicks, then I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by what a good time you have with Curse of the Black Pearl.  This pirate movie is Errol Flynn meets Indiana Jones.  Johnny Depp makes a great pirate with the long hair and grimy appearance, yet is pleasantly funny and very charming.  The plot is great, never slows down and even has a great twist near the end.  At the end of this sold out movie, the entire theatre erupted in applause!The special effects are amazing, costumes are perfect, acting by the cast is wonderful!  I'm hoping for a sequel.  I'm not one who runs out and buys videos, but will definitely get this one when it's released.  Its so much fun!For parents wondering if you can take your kids, I'd say yes if kids are about ten just because of the corpse crew which might be a little scary for the younger kids.  Pleasantly, though, there are no swearing or sexual situations and just one small kiss at the end.  There are of course swashbuckling sword fights and battles, but that's what pirate movies are all about!	5.0	Errol Flynn Fan	2003-07-19	3	3	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A356HBGSVZ5NRH	"B.P. ""tilley_traveler"""	Trapped by their greedy lust, the pirates of the Black Pearl realize they are cursed, caught in a miserable existence between life and decay and they long to rid themselves of it. The main character that stands out in this movie is the comical Captain Jack Sparrow, a ship-less, crewless, seemingly misplaced pirate at first, with a cunningly peculiar way with words and explanations, easily likeable. But what carries you through the film is probably the innocent, un-confessed attraction between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. And when Turner learns the truth about his father, Will and Elizabeth both find themselves repeatedly collaborating with and fighting against pirates to rescue one another.After a while, I did come to think that all the non stop conflict got to be a little tiring, and it might have been beneficial to of broken this up with a few more pauses to develop the romance a little better. But all the gory quirks weren't extremely overwhelming and really I think the storyline is just right. Haunted with some unpredictability and the right complexity that avoids losing you. It might not be for everyone, but it does provide plenty of comic relief. Arguably this is a film that could go either four or five stars, but it deserves no less then four stars in my opinion.If you like dashing one-on-one sword fights to no end, daring battles at sea and savvy, crooked pirates then you've got it all right here. It's an exciting, action packed adventure, which is quite frankly, a well put together film. My eyes got a little dry, didn't even want to blink for fear of missing something. I enjoyed it for the fresh excitement it presented and I know I would certainly enjoy watching it again. Excellent and worth seeing!	5.0	heroes among pirates	2003-07-27	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3MQQS40FK2QAQ	"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle"""	Every once in a while I'll see a film that succeeds almost 100% on the shoulders of one actor. This occurred with THE TERMINATOR with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and in THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK with Jack Nicholson. Now, with THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN that actor is Johnny Depp. His Captain Jack Sparrow is clearly a study in overacting. He moves his body almost constantly in every scene he is in, uses an accent that makes you wonder what he will say next, and displays that kind of self-appointed confidence of people who think they're the greatest but are just full of bs.Overacting usually doesn't work, especially in comedies. But think about what the result would be if Depp had played the character completely straight. The plot is an exericse in absolute silliness: Captain Sparrow's ship The Black Pearl was stolen from him in a mutiny by his first mate Barbarossa (Geoffrey Rush), who left Sparrow for dead on an island. The crew ended up with a curse that has made them immortal and turn into skeletons when the full moon hits their bodies. They kidnap a girl (  ) who is engaged to a Commodore but is clearly in love with William Turner (Orlando Bloom). Turner is determined to rescue the girl and enlists the help of Sparrow. Playing his character straight would have bored the audience.There is a good reason why. PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN runs at two and a half hours, and has swordfights that are too many and too long. Because Barbarossa and his crew are immortal it is senseless to be fighting them off with just swords. Blowing them to pieces with cannons is more sensible, but as far as I can recall only one scene demonstrates this.  Although the production design is absolutely splendid and the cinematography is breathtaking in the shots of the open sea, after a while all the swordplay and fighting become dull.It's so much better to see Johnny's overacting technique. It's immediately shown in his first scene where he arrives on shore in a boat that sinks right to the top of the mast. Watch his reaction when he walks onto the dock and is charged a fee. Depp's timing and accent cause a good laugh. He creates an even bigger laugh in a scene when he is looking in a town for a crew and comes across a couple of may or may not have been girlfriends of his. They make no secret of how they feel about him, which is funny enough. But Depp's response to them just makes it even funnier.Johnny Depp has always been an interesting actor. Like Jack Nicholson in so many of his films he makes you forget about the plot and just watch to see what he does next. Nicholson used both dialogue and physical movement to create that effect. Depp's technique is mostly dialogue and accent. In an interview he says he based his character on both Keith Richards and his favorite cartoon character: Pepe Le-Pew. I can believe that character. Like that famous cartoon skunk his Jack Sparrow is so full of himself. It's the funniest performance by Johnny Depp since ED WOOD.	4.0	An entertaining action film, and Johnny Depp at his funniest	2003-11-30	3	1	2

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A38QZLSH78HLE0	Brad Pipkins	Johnny Depp has always been one of my favorite actors. He has a sort of mysterious look to him, not to mention his incredible acting abilities. Also a long time fan of Tim Burton, who is an inventor in his own right, I always liked Depp's acting style, and can see why Mr. Burton chose him to star in many of his films. Though his film's seem to get fewer and farther between these days, Depp is still lighting up the silver-screen. His most recent film, of course, is Pirates of the Caribbean.The film mainly follows the infamous Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a drunken sort of character who is always getting into trouble. Depp's performance truly steals the show, and he pulls off Mr. Sparrow with ease. Another noteworthy performance is by Orlando Bloom playing blacksmith Will Turner, who is in love with the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightely). When Elizabeth is captured by Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush), Captain of The Black Pearl, Will goes to Mr. Sparrow, agreeing to free him from prison if Jack helps him locate the dreaded ship.Probably one of the main reasons to see Pirates of the Caribbean is for the special effects. For those who don't know, the plot of the film revolves around a curse. The curse can only inhabit the body of pirates who steal a certain treasure, one of which I can not speak of as it will give away certain plot elements that are essential to the element of &quot;surprise.&quot; This curse allows the pirates to be invulnerable, taking shots and being stabbed will not injure or kill them. With this curse comes a price, as by stepping into the moonlight will reveal a hollowed skeleton. With that being said, the transformation that occurs when the pirates step in and out of the moonlight are astonishing. Every bone moves the way a real human's skeletal structure should, and makes for some very pleasing eye candy. One of the best special effects sequences involves Captain Barbosa standing in the moonlight, drinking a bottle of wine. As the wine pours down his spine, some of the wine hits the rib cage, separating as it goes down to the wood floor.For the average movie watcher, this is a great movie if you enjoy the fantasy-adventure-action genre. While the film does slightly drag toward the end (the movie clocks in at about 143 min.), it still makes up for it by keeping you involved in the story. It's also worthy to note that the film was directed by Gore Verbinski, the same man behind The Ring. While Pirates of the Caribbean may not be as scary as The Ring, it definitely has some great fight scenes and specials effects. Check this one out, you won't regret it.	5.0	Excellent Film...	2004-02-05	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2QJH7KHQT48UJ	Brandon Jones	This Disney Theme Park ride inspired movie, suits all ages looking for action, adventure, romance and comedy or just a good time at the movies.  Johnny Depp plays Jack Sparrow, a fun, comical, sometimes loopy pirate, just trying to get his ship, The Black Pearl, back from his mutinous first mate Capt. Barbossa played by Geoffry Rush.  But what he doesn't realize until later on, is that there is in fact a curse that haunts his old crew, that can only be repremended if all the Aztec Gold pieces that were stolen, be returned to the treasure chest, with a bit of blood from each person who stole them.  This is where Orlando Bloom comes in.  His character, Will Turner, is the son of Bootstrap Turner, a long-dead pirate, who refused to mutiny against Jack Sparrow and later paid for it.  But not before sending the last piece of Aztec Gold needed to lift the curse to his son Will, who is found floating in the water by a young girl by the name of Elizabeth Swann, (Keira Knightley) the governer's daughter.  She takes the gold piece and hides it, in fear that he is a pirate and they will kill him.  They soon grow up and the pirates find out she has it.  So they kidnap her and take her to their ship.  She disquises her name as Elizabeth TURNER because she believes they will kill her if they knew she was the governer's daughter.  They mistaken her for Bootstrap Turner's daughter, and think that his blood runs through her veins and will rid them of the curse, now that they have the final gold piece.  Will Turner finds this out and offers Jack Sparrow an escape from jail, but in return, he has to help find Elizabeth.  And thus the adventure begins.  With sword fighting, cannons firing, skeleton crews, an awesome score and all-out pirate douling, Pirates of the Caribbean becomes the best movie of the year, and a must-see.  I personally, have gone three times, and am willing to go another three.  If you only see one movie this year, make it this one.

When I first learned they were going to produce a major film based on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at their amusement park only one word came to my mind, BOMB. Boy was I ever wrong.Johnny Depp is marvellous as Captain Jack Sparrow, the ""best pirate"" you'll ever see as is Geoffrey Rush in the role of the villianous Captain Barbossa. Orlando Bloom proves himself up to the task holding his own against such stellar actors as Depp and Rush and Kiera Knightley is not only as lovely as ever but proves she's more than just a pretty face.Action/Adventure - Comedy - Romance.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A36X934LXK5A4V	"Brian Hiel ""bashful monkey"""	Best:1) It's an exciting, epic swashbuckling adventure that's often very funny. The pirates are scary-looking, but generally hilarious in their antics.2) The special effects are fantastic and cutting-edge. You'll have to watch certain scenes in slow motion to really appreciate the quality and seamlessness.3) It's so jam-packed with sights and sounds you'll need to play it several times to witness everything.4) It's more fun than the Disney ride because there's more happening, it lasts longer and you don't have to wait in line (ha).5) There are so many special features you'll get sick of it all before the options run out.Worst:1) Johnny Depp's drunken English accent gets a bit tedious after awhile (but often makes his funny one-liners come across better).2) It's hard to keep track of what's going on at any given moment, especially when the fighting action gets crazy.Recommendation:It's all good fun with a lot of rewatch value - and Disney's retail price is unusually reasonable. If you don't love this movie now, you might someday - so get it just in case.	5.0	Bashful's DVD Summary #029	2004-01-21	0	0	0

Frankly, and I'm sure I'll get slammed for this, but I didn't care much for Captain Jack Sparrow. Now my kids loved him, I on the other hand felt he came across as rather less of a hero. Maybe had he been a stronger presence I would have liked him better.For the movie itself, it's pure entertainment. The undead crew of the Black Pearl, the quest to rid themselves of the curse, not to mention the side quest of Orlando Bloom who is trying to rescue the woman he loves. Excellent action and depiction of the pirate life.If you are really interested in Pirates, you might try 'Under the Black Flag'. It's a book that details the history of pirates(I reveiwed it in an earlier review). It's chock full of their ways and codes.I gave it four stars because I liked the movie, just not Jack Sparrow.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2P1N6QRJX38PK	Brice De Reviers	Well this is a nice movie with nice characters as Disney is able to create. For sure there are two sexy actors in this movie Bloom and Depp. But Depp is the only one who really leads the story. His characters is amazing, unexpected whereas the other ones are a little bit tasteless. Besides, the CGI seems they were made 2 years ago for some PS2 video games. So what was I saying ? Yes this is a not a bad movie after all : great actors, nice landscapes, good music; but if you take Depp and Bloom away well it's just a movie.I hope the next chapter will give us a better show and such theme has the potential to do so.	4.0	Could have been better anyway	2003-08-18	1	0	1

But pirates that are supposed to be myth, come and take Elizabeth, and are going to kill her, unless Will stops her with the help of the pirates's old captain, Jack Sparrow.

Johnny Depp does give a good performance, because he is a phenomenoal actor. But... this is not the real Johnny Depp. He did this movie for his kids, so don't get used to it. Johnny made a name for himself by doing movies out of the mainstream, the last place he wanted to be. He didn't want to be in the public's eye at all times. So, he did bizarre movies and pulled his role off brillantly. When I saw the movie i understood why he did it, but was very upset by what happened as a result of his performance. And the movie is not really THAT good, come on.So, 2 stars for Johnny's performance, but don't judge him buy this and don't expect him to do that many of these (except for the sequels and ""Finding Neverland"", which he is doing in hopes to get his well deserved Oscar)"	2.0	This is not Johnny Depp.....	2005-01-03	20	2	18

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3ODZBT3H37LYN	B. Souter	I havent seen the DVD. My comments are of the cinema version, which ive seen...wait for it... 8 times(^_^).Like most, i was very impressed by Depps rock star performance as the loveable rogue Jack Sparrow, but i also like Geofreey Rushs nuanced pefoamance as Captain Barbosa and also the two sets of comic characters: the two pirates who confront Sparrow a he plans to pinch a ship, and the two pirates who capture Elizabeth.To the person who was worried that Will Turner had killed his father, dont be. It was not clear to me whether he had been cursed or not. If he had been, then wills action lifted the curse. None of the pirates wanted to endure the curse another day.But one problem. When jack surreptiously pinched a gold coin, he took the curse upon himself. Yet he becames a walking skeleton too, afte only  a few days.Scenes i liked: Depps opening scene; the pirates walking under water, Barbosa telling of the curse of the aztec gold, the scene with Jack and elizabeth on the island(welcome to the carribean lass!), of course, the fight scene in the cave.Does anyone think the film shows a little of peter pan?(this is meant as a compliment)For those who hate this movie, i suggest you take a short walk off a long plank.	5.0	a real yo-ho-ho of amovie	2003-10-13	2	0	2

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3HTX1NOTTWERP	Busy Body	"The Pirates Of The Caribbean is a high-seas, swash-bucking action adventure epic that became 2003's biggest surprise hit. Unleashed in the summer the film was set to become a success, but it went way beyond that by grossing more than $300 million at the US Box Office alone, and spending month after month inside the Top 10. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (""Pearl Harbor"") and directed by Gore Verbinski (""The Ring""), ""The Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl"" is a film that will be adore by all generations.The story revolves around Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who's idyllic pirate lifestyle gets turned upside down when his enemy Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) steals his ship, the Black Pearl, and later attacks the town of Port Royal. Barbossa kidnaps the Governor's beautiful daughter (Kiera Knightley). In a desperate attempt to rescue both Elizabeth and the recapture the Black Pearl, her childhood friend and future lover Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) joins forces with Jack. The two set off on a suspense-filled adventure, but what they don't know is that a cursed treasure has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever as the undead.Granted, the plot isn't very intricate. It's very lightweight which is to be expected because this is a Disney movie aimed at it's target audience: children. The film incorporates many different themes which makes it highly enjoyable and successful in delighting so many viewers. Action, mystery, humour, romance and the unforgettable characters all add to the film in making this a particular stand out film from the past year. The special effects in the movie are also worthy of high praise. They are superbly produced and you can tell that a lot of thought and effort has gone into them. The fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed, and the location in which the film was shot is also extremely scenic and picturesque.Johnny Depp really does steal the show as Captain Jack Sparrow. His portrayal of Jack is both serious and light-hearted. It can be taken either way and he shines on both accounts. Orlando Bloom is good as the shy Will Turner. His love for Elizabeth is adorable in itself, if not for his photogenic screen appearance and rising celebrity following his role as Legolas in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy (2001-2003). Kiera Knightly works in superb contrast to the male leads in the film as the cheeky Elizabeth. Her upbeat nature and charismatic personality single-handedly supports a fraction of the film and keeps it going until the final scenes.The Special Features on this DVD are extremely worthwhile. They include:- Audio Commentaries- Epic At Sea- Diaries- Fly On The Set- Blooper Reel- Pirates In The Park- Below Deck- 19 Deleted Scenes- 'Moonlight Serenade' (Scene Progression)- Image GalleryOVERALL GRADE: 8/10The Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl was one of 2003's most successful movies and received rave reviews from critics and the public alike. However, I do feel that people went a bit over the top with this movie. Something like this hadn't come along in quite a few years, so people were so quick to jump on the bandwagon by branding it the best film in years. In reality, it's not. Don't get me wrong, it is a very enjoyable film, but somewhat overrated. The success of this film sealed possible doubts about a sequel. With more than $300 million grossed from America's wallets, a sequel is inevitable. Hopefully it will be just as enjoyable as the first."	4.0	A Very Enjoyable Movie!	2004-02-14	3	2	1

Johnny Depp as always is wonderful making us believe in his character. He was the most unique pirate I have ever seen. After all how many pirates have you seen wearing eye make-up and sporting dreadlocks. And if that isn't odd enough he has a few expressions and movements that has one pondering his sanity.The opening scene of him sailing ashore on a sinking ship is one of many that will make you laugh. The rest of the cast is great. I was especially impressed with Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightly's support. All the rest the cast are well suited to their roles as well. The adventure that has them embarking on a voyage to recover lost treasure that is being guarded by a Ghost Ship is not at all predictable as one would expect. No it has a few twists and turns that make the movie all the more delightful. The costumes, sets, F/X, music, and direction are phenomenal. No one should be displeased with this DVD.

The ships fighting, sword fights and when the cursed pirates take it over. There is also a little twist at the end so watch very carefully! Overall a great movie and I would reccomend it to anyone.

The villains are ruthless. The heroes are dashing and brave. The action is exciting and reminiscent of Return of the Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back. The soundtrack is riveting and inspired. There is also a Titanic-like love story unravelling throughout the course of the story. This movie has it all, and then some.	5.0	The Real Deal	2006-08-15	1	1	0

While I settled in with a magazine, it was not long before my reading was forgotten as I was absorbed into this swashbuckling tale.  Complete with adventure, mystery, romance (a spitfire heroine!), and a quest for treasure, this movie has all the right elements for a pirate film--and exceptionally well-done cinematography from Disney.  Not for your faint of heart, the film has some gruesome scenes of cursed dead pirates fighting their breathing brethren, so smaller children may be scared.  Other than the title, I saw no resemblance to the ride of the same name at the Magic Kingdom--this was much more fun!!

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A14LV2SJSR3102	Cartimand	A heavily mascara'd Johnny Depp camps it up no end as the rascally but nice Cap'n Jack Sparrow, with an outrageously fluctuating Australian/English accent, whilst Orlando Bloom almost matches him for pretty-boy foppishness (that hat at the end has to be seen to be believed). But, what the hell? This was never meant to be an accurately observed swashbuckler, so let's just go with the flow!Slightly over-long perhaps, with some rather inane dialogue between the dramatic set pieces, but redeemed by truly magnificent special effects and some outrageously funny visual gags (sadly, one of the best is only found on the deleted scenes disk). A bit derivative in places - including a complete rip-off of the assembling the crew scene, stolen shamelessly from the brilliant Deathstalker II (the dwarf bit), but there's enough original material to satisfy most punters here. Human interraction with zombies has probably never before been more convincingly portrayed. The skeletal monkey was a gem!Plenty of extras on the DVD 2-disk set, the &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot; scene progression feature being particularly interesting, makes this pretty good value for money.My 13 year old son fell asleep before the end, but I quite enjoyed it!So, certainly not Oscar material, but pretty entertaining all the same.	3.0	Leave-your-brain-at-home fun!	2004-01-31	0	0	0

It was, after all, branded as a goody-goody Disney movie with a bunch of heartthrobs casted in it. Big deal. How much can an undead pirate ensemble hold our attention and keep us in our seats?Well.Directed by 'The Ring' man Verbinski, produced by big time Bruckheimer, scripted by the writers of Shrek, and casted with eccentrics like the long-lost Depp, PoTC was a project that called upon an unusual combination of dedicated adventurers and artists who unabashedly engineered the movie to the extreme, purely for the audience's enjoyment. I mean, Johnny Depp with real gold teeth and eyeliner, and Geoffrey Rush with a pesky monkey on his shoulder? Different, indeed.  Not to mention those incredible supporting characters and outstanding set details that would keep your eyes glued on the screen.And why was PoTC so great? Because the people behind the movie simply delivered their all, man. PoTC is romance, humor, adventure, suspense, and horror, all in one package, perfect for the cynical, the innocent, and those in between.  I was surprised to like it, but I completely did.(Oh. And, I'm not the only one who has been surprised--and impressed. PoTC garnered FIVE Oscar nominations today, including a Best Actor nomination for Depp's, shall we say, unforgettable savvy performance.

Chester ""DeltaCross"""	I've only seen the movie twic but I'm planning on seeing it at least 3 more times in the theatre and buying it the moment it comes out on DVD.  All my friends and I agree that one word sums up this movie:  FUN!  I haven't had that much fun at a movie in a long time.  There's no catch!  No thinking involved...Just sit back and enjoy the movie.  Hope your cheek muscles are well exercised cause you're going to be smiling for most of the movie.Johnny Depp deftly plays the blundering/blabbering goofball of a pirate named Jack Sparrow.  If it weren't for this genre of movie it's easily an award caliber performance.  Jack Sparrow will have you giggling throughout the movie.  His antics both in the foreground and background of every scene are absolutely hilarious.  As a punch-drunk, borderline schizophrenic, hand jiving genius of a Pirate, Jack Sparrow seems almost a cross between a Mel Brooks and a Monty Python character.  But don't take that statement wrong.  He may be clumsy at times but all it does is hide his genius.  When needed, Jack Sparrow shows why he's the best Pirate in the world.  Good with a blade and with wit just as sharp, Jack Sparrow expertly gets out of any situation.Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow may be the keystone of this movie but one can't overlook the other performances.  The beautiful, and I do mean beautiful, Keira Knightly plays an awesome not-so-damsel-in-distress in Elizabeth Swann.  And Geoffrey Rush plays a truly nefarious and evil Pirate in Captain Barbossa, which is Jack Sparrows nemesis.  Along with Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, a black smith and the love of Elizabeth, this story really sets sail and never looks back.Combining fun special effects, a good cast, and a great story, makes for a super entertaining movie.  Go see this movie at least twice...  If not three times.  Trust me you'll like it.  Truly one of the best movies I've ever seen and one of the best performances by any actor.

Not to mention, hystorically funny. He was the whole film. If Johnny is nominated for an OSCAR for BEST ACTOR for this film, he better get it.Orlando Bloom is in the role of WILLIAM &quot;WILL&quot; TURNER. I never heard of Orlando until this movie. I thought Orlando was amazing in this. He deserves the OSCAR for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR.Geoffry Rush is in the role of the EVIL CAPTAIN of THE BLACK PEARL.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AB34G6VKP28L	"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic"""	"I held off writing this review for a long time, since I knew so many other people would leap at the chance to praise ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" up one side and down the other. It's not that the film doesn't deserve praise -- it does. It's the best swashbuckler to come out in fifty years. I saw it four times in the cinema, which for someone who has to drive sixty miles one-way to reach a theatre, is second only to my ""Lord of the Rings"" trips. The movie satisfies on a lot of levels. It has humor, romance, horror, and comedy. There's also a very unique, intelligent scriptwriter at work behind the scenes. The dialogue is (almost) all first-rate, though a couple of recent terms were thrown in for comical purposes. As a connoisseur of period films, I can tell you the historical accurately is fairly first-rate (with the minor exception of blush-worthy plot mistakes such as having Port Royal situated on the cliffs).The cinematography on this film is what makes it outstanding. Whether it's Elizabeth Swann preparing to faint from a too-tight-corset on a parapet, or the tattered Black Pearl sailing in the moonlight, there's always something wondrous to gaze at on the screen. One fantastic underwater shot peruses a school of hammerheads as they drift endlessly through an underwater cove of sunken, ghostly ships. The introductory scene is also stunning, one of the most spell-casting experiences I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The Interceptor creeping through a mist-shrouded sea, the umbrella floating by, the magnificent horror of seeing a burning merchant ship, and our first glimpse of the Black Pearl as it sails into the fog. This scene alone makes the movie ticket price well worth it... and that's only the first four minutes.As many profession and personal critics have observed, the film belongs to Johnny Depp's memorable performance as ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow, the single pirate able to elude the curse thanks to his crew mutinying before the gold could be spent. But the other performers shouldn't be overlooked in his hilariously likable wake. In the role of a very strong, independent heroine, Kiera Knightley manages to be both beautiful and spirited without escaping into clich&eacute;. Orlando Bloom is more likable here than as the aloof Legolas he's become so well known for; with some excellent action scenes, he shows his unique skill with a blade as well as has the opportunity to carry off a romantic lead with a keen flair. Geoffrey Rush is at his best; being a fan of his endeavors, it was a pleasure to watch him on screen in a very different, very misunderstood role. He manages to make Barbossa both fascinating, horrible, and yet have a shred of sorrow at the end for his passing. Two extremely underrated actors, Britain's Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce, are given the respective roles of Commodore Norrington, Elizabeth's unfortunate fianc&eacute;e, and her governor father.For once, scriptwriters haven't copped out and given us an easy decision. While being slightly arrogant and something of an egotist, Norrington is also extremely likable, a perfect gentleman, and one might even go so far as to say, the most noble character by the closing credits. Davenport plays him with just the right amount of lethargic enthusiasm and irritation; his scenes with Depp, always wrought with blatant humor, are some of the film's finest moments. Pryce doesn't have a lot to work with, but the audience cannot help but chuckle over some of his humorous traits, such as fighting a skeletal hand for his magnanimous wig. The music is also first-rate, very mood-setting with a certain sense of dramatic tension even in romantic scenes. The film is well worth a PG13 rating, but is never inappropriate for younger audiences. The mild innuendo will go over children's heads (and most parents as well, for that matter -- only literature history-lovers will pick up some of the sly historical jests), the violence is all quite bloodless, and there's virtually no profanity. The pirates are properly frightening and in various stages of decay, extremely cool from a CGI perspective.A movie well worth its praise, and one you simply MUST own on DVD for all its subtleties."	5.0	Savvy	2003-10-13	8	7	1

Let's face it:  other than Depp &amp; the scenery-chewing performance of Geoffery Rush (who calls on every pirate stereotype known to man --- arrrrh!), everyone else is pretty forgettable, especially Orlando Bloom &amp; Keira Knightley (and their attendent cheesy love subplot).  The special effects are decent enough, and the sword-fight choreography is generally average (where is Erroll Flynn when you really need him?).  The goofy soundtrack gets pretty old pretty quickly, and the plot in general doesn't exactly leave the viewer on the edge of his seat?All in all, it is a pretty average film, except that Depp takes over the movie in every scene he is in, as he portrays perhaps the swishiest (or totally besotted, take your pick) pirate ever to be portrayed on the big screen.  Captain Jack Sparrow's utterly bizarre persona leaves one fascinated, and raises an otherwise run-of-the-mill pirate adventure flick to a higher, more enjoyable level.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AU78WGAXA3IY1	"Chelle ""Chelle"""	"From the moment I saw the first trailer for Pirates I was eagerly anticipating its release in theaters.First, being an avid Disney fan, I was curious to see how they'd turn the ride into a movie. And I must say that I'm glad they chose to present Pirates of the Caribbean because it exploits a truly fascinating time period. Just like young Elizabeth Swan (Knightley), I have grown up with a certain romanticized vision of pirates and can remember a time or two when I donned a wooden sword and eye patch to be a famous female pirate of the not-so-high seas. Fortunately for kids and adult dreamers alike the movie, like the ride, doesn't try to dissuade us from thinking of pirates in terms of fantastic fun instead of merciless amorality.And then they cast one of the best character actors to come around in a good long time in the infamous role of Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp. No other man could embody such a vast array of personalities and time periods with the flair and knack that Depp does. Tell him he's going to be a gypsy and he'll pull his dark hair back in a neat queue and make you crave more than just chocolate. Tell him he's going to be a queasy constable and he'll still manage to make ruffled collars and bumbling actions sexy. My point being, of course, is that there is no other man that could play a pirate captain better than Depp. The hilarity that ensues in the movie is almost entirely carried out by Depp and his rather frivolous posturing. He confuses and charms and in so doing may very well be ""the best pirate I've ever seen."" And since, as we all know, a captain is only so good as his crew Depp had the very able bodied Orlando Bloom to help keep the audience happily sailing along. All I'll say is that watching Bloom wield a sword is a beauteous thing indeed. But, really, teaming up Depp and Bloom was a wonderful move. They have great chemistry, which came through brilliantly when they fought (each other as well as back to back.)What's more, the Caribbean setting was evocative and stirring and the effects, namely the skeletons, are nifty and thankfully not overdone.There is no way to express the enjoyment to be had by seeing this movie in a review. You can say that it is humorous, but that's just a word and doesn't do its tongue-in-cheek, campy fun any justice. You can say that there is just enough action to do the time period proud, but it's still best to see for yourself. You can even say the actors, all of them, pull off their respective roles with pizazz, but who knows what pizazz is unless you experience it firsthand? If you want to be entertained then, by all means, see Pirates of the Caribbean today."	4.0	Remarkably Entertaining	2003-07-13	3	3	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1QM8DJLEUEV7O	Chelsea	When the movie was originally released last summer, I had no interest in seeing it, until I found out that my favorite actor was in it.  I thought that it was going to be some ridiculous gory pirate-type movie, but it is not at all.  The epic battle scenes are really cool and not really gory.  Orlando Bloom plays a somewhat shy blacksmith (he was 8 when he was rescued from the water), but the shy blacksmith image only lasts for about 10 minutes into the movie.  Orlando was obviously fantastic in this movie, but Johnny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrow) absolutely deserves an Oscar.  His performance is impossible to describe, you simply must see it in order to appreciate how talented you have to be to pull off such a complicated role.  This movie was highly underated by critics and is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It incorporates so many thematic elements, like comedy, romance, and action.  This movie will be loved by all!  The Pirates of the Caribean will not disappoint!  What are you waiting for?  Buy this movie!  (Amazon's price is the cheapest I have seen.)

It was such a fun and entertaining movie to watch, I can't believe I let people talk me out of watching it in the theatres!  People complained about not liking the storyline or thinking it was too long and boring.  After watching it on video, I wonder what is wrong with people??!!  There was nothing boring or long about it.  There were parts in the movie that were similar to the ride, which is one of the top bests at Disneyland.  The storyline was great and the acting made it greater!  Sometimes I think people don't know how to enjoy a simply entertaining film anymore.  Sure, it's not epic like the Lord of the Rings movies (which are great!!!), but Pirates of the Caribbean is great in its own right.  Watch it to be entertained and get a lot of laughs from.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3N8RZSXKN1OR2	Chrijeff	"I've been on the Pirates ride, and except for one scene (I won't tell you which it is), I didn't recognize much of it in this movie.  But, standing on its own, PotC is a wild delight made up of equal parts swashbuckler, horror tale, and love story.  Johnny Depp as the flamboyant Captain Jack Sparrow has spent ten years trying to track down the crew that mutinied, marooned him on an uninhabited islet, and sailed off with his beloved ship, the Black Pearl.  Meanwhile his former first mate, Barbossa, has spent eight of those years struggling to lift from himself and his crew a fearful curse laid on them by their theft of an Aztec treasure.  The final remaining piece of that treasure is in the possession of Elizabeth, daughter of the Royal Governor of Port Royal, and Barbossa's men attack the island to acquire it (""It calls to us,"" says one pirate upon demanding the piece from her).  But there's something else they need to lift the curse: the blood of a fellow mutineer whom they murdered when he tried to dissuade them from taking the treasure.  Since they can't get his, that of his child--Will Turner, the young swordsmith who has loved Elizabeth since they met soon after his ship was attacked by the Pearl's crew--will do.  What they don't at first realize is that Elizabeth isn't the child they want, so they carry her off to Isla de Muerta, their hidden stronghold.  Will, desperate to rescue her, frees Sparrow from prison in hopes of getting his help.  What follows is a rollercoaster of escapes, rescues, duels, splendid sea-fights, and general non-stop action.  (The thunderous score is a plus: don't fail to get the CD!Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl)  The youngest kids will probably be disturbed by the skeletal forms the pirates assume when ""the moonlight shows us for what we really are,"" but I didn't find them overly terrifying, and they turn out to be vital to the plot: neither dead nor living, they can literally walk along the bottom of the sea, which allows them to board the royal warship sent in pursuit of them and very nearly annihilate the crew.  In the very nick of time Jack cleverly finds a way to break the curse, and at the end Will and Elizabeth find each other and Jack himself is saved from the gallows.Depp's performance is a delight throughout (Jack will probably live as one of the best characters created in his career), and the motley crew he gathers up to help him and Will in their pursuit of the Pearl reminds me of Burt Lancaster's in his classicThe Crimson Pirate(there's also a scene fairly early on that's a direct lift from the latter, and anyone who has seen it will recognize it immediately).  Keira Knightley is a very competent heroine with definite tomboy tendencies, whom modern viewers will like, and Orlando Bloom (formerly known as Legolas, the Elven archer, in the LOTR trilogy) as Will does a good job as the young commoner who discovers that a pirate can also be ""a good man.""  Watch out, too, for Anamaria, the very handsome black lady pirate who serves as Jack's helms...woman.  This is definitely a DVD I plan to add to my collection."	5.0	A wild ride indeed	2008-02-23	2	1	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ADWX0Z5RMX2BY	Chris B	Pirates of the Caribbean is a superb film consisting of all the criteria for a BLOCKBUSTER! Among many reviews I have read about this movie, a striking 95% of critics rave that this movie has got it all! Components of a good movie are improved to make this movie one of the best ever made.You wonder how good this movie could really be? Picture award winner Johnny Depp and award winner Orlando Bloom in the same movie. Believe it now?In short, a young lad by the name of Will Turner (Bloom) leads a blacksmith's life. All of this changes when he meets his childhood sweetheart Elizabeth Swan, played by the stunningly beauitful Keria Knightly. She is kidnapped by the evil pirate Barbossa (Rush) for she holds the pirate's necessity. Will Turner sets out to save her, but anamazingly humorous Johnny Depp, playing mischievious pirate Jack Sparrow accompanies him. They journey through stormy seas to save Elizabeth before Barbossa and his men can do any harm to her.Out of the very, very, very few reviews claiming it to be a failure, this movie is exceptionally done and is a must see. Add this review to your pros when you are debating to see the movie and you will be on your way.Also, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disney World/Land is really good, try it when you go!By the way, what do you think about a Pirates of the Caribbean 2? :)	5.0	DISNEY DOESIT AGAIN!	2003-08-25	1	1	0

As I'm sure you've heard, Johnny Depps performance is worth seeing this alone. The way he swaggers across the screen and delivers each line makes it so you can't take your eyes off him. I've been a fan of his for a long time and this is one of his best performances. But I also think that everyone else in this movie was superb as well. I just can't see anyone else playing Will Turner and the stunningly beautiful governers daughter Elisabeth, played by Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.

One of the funnier cinematic moments I've ever seen came as Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) sailed into the London (?) harbour - on the top of the sail of his sinking ship.  Sparrow's pride - perhaps misplaced, at times - and quick wits made the first half of this movie.  With some excellent fight scenes, comedy to die for, a cude undead monkey, and the line, ""Yes, but why is the rum gone?""

Although the movie has a good comedic quality about it and a fun, almost silly feel about it, the story line is a little cliched. Johnny Depp takes the cup for making the movie. Orlando Bloom, for all his good looks, just can't act a pirate that well - sorry ladies. Watch all the negative ratings come on this post! Keira Knightley is stunning, and does a decent job playing Orlando's (and Johnny's)love interest. Keep an eye out for her in the near future - this performance is a step up from her role in Bend it like Beckham.In classic Disney tradition, ""Pirates of the Carribean"" is great for family viewing and an ideal show if a lighthearted Pirate yarn is your taste at the moment."	3.0	A Pirate version of The Mummy - only better!	2003-08-28	9	3	6

Disney topped itself as Pirates outshines Finding Nemo and marks a landmark film for the company, it's their first PG-13 release. The plot is full of sub-plots each interesting in its own regard and for a 2 1/2 hour movie there is not a boring moment. Johnny Depp shines as Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate combination of Captain Morgan and Kieth Richards. The special effects are amazing as the cursed crew of the Black Pearl change into skeletal remains beneath the moonlight, they even change back and forth instantly merely walking by windows or under holes in caves. Director Gore Verbinski blends dry humor and action seamlessly and producer Jerry Bruckhiemer brings us the typical, yet amazingly fun action his movies are recognized for.

When I first heard a movie was being made after an amusement ride I scoffed, in the way that only a northeastern liberal of predominantly WASP ancestory can.  But I was terribly wrong.  Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush bring their characters(the former a lovable scoundrel, the latter a bloodthirsty fiend) to life in a way I could have never imagined before watching it.It would be hard to find a line with more pathos that that of Rush's when he tells Knightly, &quot;I feel nothing, not the wind in my face, nor the spray of the sea, nor the warmth of a women's touch&quot;.  As for Depp, whenever on screen he steals the show, parrticularly Bloom who so often seems lost in some medieval drama of many more centuries past(i.e. &quot;youre the one who threatened Miss Swann&quot;-- far too proper to refer to the woman he loves by her first name).  I remember Jack Sparrow best as he awaited the gallows, smiling foundly as his crime of &quot;impersonating a cleric of the church of England&quot; is read aloud.A must watch(and to me a must own) for anyone.	5.0	Eye candy for everyone!	2003-12-25	0	0	0

I figured wrong.The plot is pretty simple. Pirates kidnap Elizabeth (Kira Knightley), and her blacksmith beau, Will Tanner (Orlando Bloom), commandeers a ship with the help of Capt. Jack Sparrow, played with much wit and humor by Johnny Depp, to rescue her. The pirates turn out to mutineers, that stole Aztec gold, and were cursed. The curse means that no one will ever sing ""Moonlight Becomes You"" to them, as said lighting shows them for what they really are, skeletons. Subterfuge and duels commence.Surprisingly, the acting is good, and the special effects never overtake the film. Little wonder, as Knightly, Bloom and Depp have all worked in SE-filled blockbusters (Star Wars Ep. I, Lord Of The Rings, and Edward Scissorhands, respectivly). They turn in great preformances in what is otherwise an action-packed blockbuster with a costume drama wish.Anyway, this would be a great date movie, girls will swoon for Orli and Johnny, and guys will love the swash-buckling action.Bottom Line: Moonlight becomes this bucaneer flick, and it's little wonder it debuted at number one."	4.0	Much better then expected.	2003-07-18	2	2	0

No, it's not some dramatic, sordid story about love and heartbreak. It's not an indie film that borders on being pretentious. This is just a really fun, witty and colorful movie. Johnny Depp plays the slightly snarky Jack Sparrow and does an amazing job.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2KGCK3Q4VARC8	Christopher Greffin	Pirates of the Carribean is a mixture of silliness and seriousness which can be odd but is never unitersting. Depp plays Jack Sparrow, a pirate outcast who finds himself running from those that find him a blasphamy. Eventually Elizabeth, played Kiera Knightly, is kidnapped by cursed pirates bent on getting back their gold coins so they can be human once again. Jack and Will, Elizabeth's love, set off to rescue her. Their adventure has drama and quirkiness, and has some unexpected turns.The whole idea that these cursed pirates could ever actually have found every one of their gold coins is obsurd as some could very well be at the bottom of the ocean. The film doesn't play to historical realism. Instead it plays to creating a world of its own, and there is does a good job. There are some fun battles, and one of the better swordfights in recent cinematic history. Bloom and Knightly do adaquet jobs, though both are certianly overshadowed by Depp's onscreen carisma.It goes a little too long at nearly two and a half hours, and I wasn't big on the ending, but it should satisfy most adventure fans. It's not a great movie. I'm not really looking forward to the sequel because I fear the combination won't work as well once again. Take what you want it's satisfying.	4.0	Worth watching because it's fun, and for Depp's performance	2006-02-05	2	1	1

You may have fooled the majority of the viewing public into loving you, but not me.First of all, there are countless factual inaccuracies in this movie that need to be addressed:1) Pirates have a heart, deep down.  No they don't.  They are brutal killing machines like the bad robots in Robocop movies, and nothing will stop them (except maybe Robocop, because he is part robot and part police officer).2) In pirate-y days people used to fall in love.  Untrue.  Love was discovered in the 1930s, between the two World Wars.  Pirates only know about hate and treasures.That's it for the historical inaccuracies.  But also I strongly dislike pirates, so how could I possibly like this movie?If they ever make a sequel, and God forbid they do, they should have one pirate played by Peter Deluise and one by Richard ""Booker"" Grieco."	1.0	Pirates?

Being an absolute Orlando Bloom fan, this movie was a must-see anyhow.The action is great throughout the entire movie, including many humorous scenes with Johnny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrows). Intertwined into the overall story line of Jack Sparrow wanting his stolen ship back, the cursed Black Pearl, is a love story between the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightely) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom&lt;3). This movie is a super family movie that will make you long for the pirate's life!	5.0	ArRr! A Pirate's life for me!	2003-07-10	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2KWFGHX2PKJJB	"C. J Peters ""Anne"""	I thought this wasn't going to be that good. But, I enjoyed every minute of it. When it was over I was tempted to go see it again. Jonny Depp really surprised me. This is not his typical role.  JONNY DEPP WAS THE MOVIE! There is just no way of putting it. Orlando was good, not to mention really hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But, he was rather wimpy in this one. If there is one thing that movies have always done right by its the music. Jonny sends you into a laugh attack with each word. The action is Great! The special effects are stunning. You just can't go wrong with this one.  My favorite part is when the pirates are walking on the bottom of the ocean.  And, then the last fight scene. And, the symbolic nature of the apple. I can't think of why anyone would not like this one.  I think the one reason Jonny is so famous in this movie is because of his first sighting. That ship sinking as he is standing on the top.  I don't care what people say, that's just classic. Then, when the cold sends off that wave.  And, it starts to get dark. That is really powerful. Then the beach scene. And, you can't forget Pola or was it posnip. Every scene was just as funny and good as the next. I won't mind being a immortal pirate. Anyway, I love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	5.0	A Pirates Life for me!!!	2004-08-30	2	1	1

First -class special effects, and for the most  part, wonderful acting.  Johnny Depp was awesome. I  loved his portrayal of Jack Sparrow.  Geoffery Rush was also great as Captain Barbossa.  I think Orlando Bloom was typecast, along with Keira Knightley, but they both pulled off their rolls pretty well. The foremost reason I like this movie is that it's Fun!  It really makes you feel good after you've watched it.  I've seen it at least 30 times, and it's still great!	5.0	Pirates is a really fun summer movie!	2004-08-10	5	4	1

Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Carribean is a funny, romantic and action packed rollercoaster ride hence the one it was based on. Johnny Depp easily steals the show in an oscar calibre performance which he should have claimed. Orlando Bloom's turn as a lovestruck blacksmith is enough to get the girls swooning everywhere.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ATOS750XCC9MQ	Classis Genre Film Fanatic	I've always liked pirate movies. Ever since Cutthroat Island (yes, I liked this movie)I've wanted more pirate films to be made.I didn't see this film in the theater, but when it came out on DVD, my parents bought it so I watched it at their house. It was an amazingly fun film! Johnny Depp should've gotten the oscar for his performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. Whatever movies he's in, good or bad, Johnny Depp is always great.Orlando Bloom, while a decent actor, is just starting his acting career. He's off to a great start actually, with The Lord of the Rings films and this film along with upcoming sequels! But his character in this film didn't seem much different than Legolas in LOTR. Sure, he looked different, and he WAS playing a different character. But his mannerisms seemed quite similar to Legolas. I think he needs to work on developing new unique characters for the films he's in. Nevertheless, he still acted good in this.Keira Knightley was great, although I can't remember what her name was in the film(I can't remember Orlando's character's name either!). She's just such a beautiful actress. She's got the look and the acting skills down.The story is great. The special effects are great. The sword fighting is great. This film is great.The DVD is packed full of extras that are actually worth watching. I especially enjoyed watching how they did the effect of the pirates transforming into skeletons whenever they go under moonlight.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2C3MWVKGGBJFS	Clob Lane	This sparkling, big-budget production starring Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, along with Keira Knightly and Geoffrey Rush, is a wonderfully exciting adventure. Although some things like having sword-fights with pirates that are immortal, this film is one heck of a roller-coaster ride, which is on MY personal top ten list for newly-released films this year.Johnny Depp's performance is the best performance here, and gives a modern vibe like a drunken rockstar of some sort (hehe), but that's not a bad thing. His character is incredibly put together and his mood swings (even if there are few) are well scripted. I wasn't completely satisfied by Orlando Bloom, as he isn't one of my favourite actors, but I think he was well chosen for this part and maybe it was just the character, I don't know.I liked Keira Knightly in this film, as she is not only a good actress, she is beautiful and skilled to do alot of things other actresses can't resort to while they're acting.Overall, I'd say this is a great movie, with some minor flaws, but no film is perfect, right? But before I leave off on this review, be warned: purchase a LARGE bag of popcorn as this runs nearly 3 hours long!	5.0	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Purl	2003-07-21	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	Ever read those proposal stories where the guys buries his ring box inside something like 10 boxes, progressively bigger in size? It's as if there's way too much than is necessary, 2's probably good enough but 10? So Pirates of the Caribbean manages to be solid fun that feels way too long for it's own good. What you get here though is fun in the meantime it's just a case of a director loving his work too much.It's a movie based on a theme park at Disneyland so it's obviously not going to have the most complicated plot but this is Disney so no need to worry. Basically, Captain Jack Sparrow with the help of Will and Elizabeth try to take down Barbossa, captain of a ship swarming with cursed pirates. That's basically it in a nutshell.Many were skeptical about the film when it came out. Remember Cutthroat Island? For those who haven't seen it, consider yourself lucky. Us other people tried to erase it from our minds but we just can't, so another pirate movie, based on a theme park attraction also, surely wouldn't be a hit. And look at that, it became a huge money maker, most likely due to the action, effects and it's lead star.It's produced by Jerry Bruckheimer so one word should come to mind: explosions. He likes make thing go boom very often and here you of course get explosions and cannon fire, although there is some swordplay too. The effects are quite stellar with some cool shots of skeletons washing the deck and causing mischief. My favorite shot is when they're underwater coming out from the darkness, very nicely done. Even later in the film where 2 characters are going in and out of skeletal and their real forms you can see quick transitions.Watching you're bound to notice one thing: Johnny Depp. Incredibly versatile, he's one of the few actors that you can probably write him any kind of part and he'll be good(although to be fair, I'm not a fan of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). Drawing inspiration from Keith Richards, he plays an androgynous and very twitchy captain that you can't help but like. The rest of the cast is good too although I'm not a fan of Orlando Bloom in anything.The length is an issue since they kind of overstretched a plot that's bordering on snapping in half but still it's great fun, just watch it now and then.	5.0	Fun wrapped in way too many boxes	2006-04-04	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1MASJ0LBMMJ2U	"C. MacLorcain ""CM"""	This is an amazing movie. You watch it, expecting it to be like every other pirate movie out there, but no. this one is different. this one has something to it that makes you enjoy it a whole lot more.Firstly, there is always a bit of humor. Johnny Depp is masterful in this role, and is a truely amazing actor. He is hilarious, and i personlly just LOVE the way he walks and the way he talks. its like he has a permanent swagger, and a permantent slur. it's hilarious.The second great attribution to the movie is the way it stays right on task. it does not get lost in the humor, nor does it get lost in the plot. there is always some humor, yet it still right on task with the needed serious scenes.  This is a movie for just about everyone, if your looking for comedy, romance, action, or the combination... its here!Finally, the acting in this movie is masterful. Every actor/actress played his/her part beautifully. Johnny Depp did an awesome job! The whole cast did an amazing job though.I would highly reccomend buying this movie/dvd for yourself or for a friend/family member. This would make a great christmas gift or birthday gift.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A32IWIJ6UI3YYF	coachtim	Having watched the DVD, &quot;Pirates of the Carribean&quot; twice now (and I rarely watch ANY movie more than once), I can truthfully say that it ranks with any of the great fantasy/action films that I've seen in the past 10-15 years.  The closest comparison is the Indiana Jones series with it's cliff-hanging, non-stop action.By now, you've read enough reviews or you already know what the movie is about, so let me skip all of that.Filled with memorable characters, &quot;Pirates&quot; is a movie that will appeal to movie fans from 8-80.  Johnny Depp steals the show with his wonderful portrayal of pirate Captain Jack Sparrow.  Geoffrey Rush is great as Captain Barbossa, former first-mate of Sparrow's who has stolen his ship, the Black Pearl, out from under him.  (His character reminded me of Cyril Richards, the terrific Capt. Hook in the original &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.)  And, newcomers Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley play the parts of the star-crossed lovers with energy and enthusiasm.The scenery and CGI graphics add greatly to the production of this mega-hit.  Realistic ship-to-ship battle scenes and authentic-looking sword fights increase the realism of the film.  And, if you're into plenty of extras on your DVD, then you'll spend a lot of hours going through all the things (bloopers, 19 deleted scenes, the &quot;making-of&quot; the film, etc.) included with the film.All in all, just a tremendous film that's great fun for the viewer and wonderful escapism.  Sit back and enjoy!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	5.0	A truly outstanding movie that will appeal to all ages!	2004-01-05	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1T17LMQABMBN5	CoffeeGurl	There are two things I love: pirates and Johnny Depp.  Putting those two together is a dream come true.  And to have Depp play a pirate is even better.  I loved Pirates of the Caribbean.  This entertaining action-adventure film is a roller coaster ride of action-packed scenes and a feast for the eyes as well.  Set in eighteenth century, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl tells the story of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and the governor's daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and their adventures after they encounter the rather bizarre and enigmatic Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp).  Jack wants to find the ship Black Pearl and his nemesis, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and settle an old score.  But Barbossa has his own plans -- he wants to reverse an old spell that has left him and the other borders of the Black Pearl living as immortals that keeps them from enjoying the simple pleasures of life (like eating, drinking, etc.).  This puts Elizabeth in danger and Will Turner will be there to rescue her, but in doing so he discovers a few things about himself.I had my doubts about this film at first because... well, it's a movie inspired by a theme park ride, for crying out loud.  But since I love Johnny Depp and all things that are remotely set in a different time frame, I decided to give it a whirl.  This film is such a fun treat!  Both children and adults could enjoy it and the special effects are wonderful.  I love the cast, especially Depp and Bloom.  Johnny Depp is gorgeous (even in over the top pirate regalia) and so talented.  He's a chameleonic actor who once again showcases his abilities to portray a character flawlessly.  Orlando Bloom is another gorgeous specimen and I enjoyed him a whole lot.  The weakest link to me is Keira Knightley, but fortunately the story doesn't completely revolve around her character.  The supporting cast, namely Jack Davenport, is also great.  I loved this action/adventure flick and I look forward to watching the sequel.	5.0	One hell of a fun ride!	2007-02-16	2	2	0

But with Pirates of the Caribbean they get a whole new style.The story begins when a British Navy vessel comes across a burning ship, victims of pirates. Floating with the debris is young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) son of famous pirate Bootstraps Bill. Around his neck is a medallion, a very unique medallion.8 years later Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives in the British village of Port Royal, Jamaica. The former captain of the Black Pearl wants revenge, on his mutinous first mate Captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush).All grown up, Will Turner, a black smith, has taken a fancy to Miss Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightly), the governor's daughter. When Elizabeth and Will met 8 years earlier she stole the medallion for fear he was a pirate.As fate would have it Barbossa raids the town looking for his medallion, and it's owner. Will takes the help of Jack to find Miss Swan, and for Jack the Black Pearl.This new motion picture by Disney will have you taking a whole new look at Disney.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A39LRLKACX89IP	Courtland J. Carpenter	When I was a kid I liked pirate movies like Captain Blood, or the Crimson Pirate.  I haven't really seen many new entries in the genre, over the last 20 years.  I didn't think moviemakers could really bring back the sense of adventure, which I'd felt in those old films on cable.  Amazingly, I was wrong, this film has a lot to recommend it, even for today's discerning audience.In past pirate classics, it seemed the hero either retired from piracy, or was secretly working for the king (The Kings Pirate movie comes to mind.).  In this picture we have a committed pirate, (played by Johnny Depp) with no apologies, or promises to reform.  He basically steals the picture from Orlando Bloom, with his over the top, flamboyant badness.The story itself is an epic tale of a quest, a journey to lift a truly nasty curse on the pirates.  Special effects are extraordinary, and help drive the plot rather than detract from it.  The movie is long, and somewhat episodic, but the acting, and action sequences hold your attention throughout.  I understand they actually built two, full-scale, ships for this movie.  I can believe it, because the filmed shots of the deck fights, shipboard action, looked realistic. The movie had many unusual camera angles, more so than I'm used to seeing in these kinds of films.The movie evokes images of Treasure Island, legendary ghost ships, and epic treasure hunts.  You have your pirate's cove, desert islands, cannon fights, raids, and romance.  The movie's beginning is designed to show us, that there is an obvious, but forbidden attraction in some of us, to the life of a pirate.  A kind of feeling, which brings a certain romanticized longing, for the freedom found, in that bold kind of profession.  Depp's performance adds just that much more credence, to this kind of emotion.	5.0	I can't believe I actually liked a new pirate movie!	2003-11-15	6	5	1

I saw the movie many times and his talent never failed to amaze me. His talent almost was equal to the very experienced, Jhonny Depp who also did a wonderful job in his inturpetation of Jack Sparrow. I dont think that there is anyone else in the world who could have made the chessy humor in the movie work; yes, i did say chessy. Altough i did enjoy the movie emensley it would have been a little better if they had toned down on the jokes and mad the more elaberate.I found that many critics hated the movie and those who liked it where amazed that a movie about Pirates actually worked out. When i went to but the movie the store was sold out because they where not pepared to meet the demands of the many customers out to buy the very entertaning movie. So all i really have to say is without the wonderful acting jobs the movie would not have even made it to the theater.	5.0	Great acting jobs!	2003-12-07	0	0	0

A pirate's life for me!With the sequel set to come out in July, I thought it was time I reviewed the phenomenal movie that is Pirates of the Caribbean. The basic plot is this: A shipful of cursed pirates possess a treasure that causes them to turn into skeletons whenever there's a full moon--which is, through an unfortunate mistake, every single night. They must return the treasure to break the curse. Meanwhile, Captain Sparrow holds a grudge on the Captain, Barbossa, and intends to get around the slight difficulty of the fact that he is unkillable. Orlando Bloom as Will Turner lusts after Kiera Knightly as Elizabeth Swann, despite the fact that she is enaged to Commordore Norrington, played by Jack Davenport who gives a great performance.This movie stars two of today's biggest stars: Johnny Depp, in the performance of a lifetime, and Orlando Bloom, in a performance that is pretty much an afterthought. I originally watched this for Bloom, but the character I fell in love with was Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. He based the character on Keith Richards, and it shows.You should refresh your memory with a quick viewing of this if you don't want to miss Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest, which is coming out soon and promises to be one of the best summer movies. However, you'll soon find yourself watching it again...and again...and again...The special features are nice, but the commentaries aren't that great. There are frequent long silences. The most interesting feature is the interactive exploration of a pirate ship. There are also some neat featurettes about the making of the movie, but none of the features are especially standout good. The main event is definitely the movie itself.Drink up, me hearties yo ho!	5.0	The funniest thing ever to come out of a theme park	2006-05-06	2	1	1

The cursed crew wreaks mayhem on the Caribbean in this quest.I then heard about the cast - especially Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush, two actors that only seek interesting parts.  And that best describes the film: a dull story raised well above its genre by the quality of the performances.  To wit: It is a standard pirate story containing shipboard swashbuckling and a damsel in distress.  There is also a potentially corny Jane Austinesque love triangle where the girl must decide between the noble and safe match in marriage over the poor boy she actually loves.  There is some novelty in the scale and quality of the special effects, but Erol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks have already amply covered this territory.Depp especially, and also Rush descend on this plot with reckless abandon.  Rush chews up the scenery as the captain of the cursed pirates.  He had previously taken over the ship from its former captain, played by Depp.  As is common knowledge now, Depp somehow channels the personality of quirky, slightly effeminate rock stars (such as Keith Richards) in a way that he crafts a memorable and not out-of-place main character around which the film can support itself.  None of the action can be absurd because Depp himself is so absurd that this Caribbean is like a parallel universe.  Everything then follows from this performance - we can enjoy Rush's over-the-top performance, we can enjoy the absurd curse plot, etc.Ironically, the best performance after Depp's might actually be Orlando Bloom's as the town's earnest and upright blacksmith.  He is in the unenviable position of needing to be the foil for Depp as the Depp walks off with all the best lines and action.  He wisely avoids trying to compete, or to try and create his own over-the-top characterisation.  Because of this choice, the film has a core of sanity to contrast and offset the performances of Depp and Rush.  The combination works extremely well, helped by the lesser characters, such as the naval commodore entrusted with hunting the pirates.This DVD edition is quite good.  It's got the usual commentaries and deleted scenes, but also a very interesting making-of featurette suite, including a video diary of the captain of the Lady Washington (the ship that ""played"" the British frigate Interceptor in the film) and that ship's voyage from its home port in California through the Panama Canal.  There is also some information on real pirates - their lives and biographies of some notable examples.  Finally, Disney wisely managed to restrain itself from including a full-blown promotion for its theme parks."	4.0	A mediocre idea raised to a higher level by the quality of the performances	2005-09-12	6	4	2
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	What a fun movie!  Honestly, I expected little from this movie.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The visual effects are very good.  But you knew that from the previews.  What I didn't know was how quirky the plot is.  There are a lot of fun twists.  When you think you know what to expect, you find you were wrong.  And it is very funny.  I laughed a lot.But it is exciting as well.  My 12 and 10 year olds found this to be a heart-pounding thriller.  At a couple of points they were so scared they said they found it hard to watch the screen.  Not from horror, but because they found the suspense hard to bear.  But they couldn't turn away.  Afterwards, they raved about the movie.I personally loved the way the character of Captain Jack Sparrow moves through the movie almost apart from it, but deeply involved in every aspect of both sides of the issues.  He is after his own objectives and all his alliances are temporary and his methods brilliant.  Johnny Depp is superb in this role as is Geoffry Rush as the villain Barbossa.  Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom bring energy and verve to their roles and a fun to watch.  The whole cast enlivens this movie with the spirit of fun no matter how tense things get in the plot.There are many many extras offered with this movie.  They are of varying quality and interest, but none are as fun as the movie itself.  For me, this was a surprising delight.	4.0	A Surprising Delight	2004-01-09	2	2	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AIC7J32QZY2KF	Craig Moller	What happens when Johnny Depp stars in pirates of the caribbean, well simple the movie becomes a blockbuster hit and very successful in the box office. Director Gore Verbinski (Mouse Hunt) gives the audience a refreshing new type of movie which has become extremely popular worldwide (has been translated into more than fifty different languages). Just goes to show how good of a director he is.Here Johnny Depp gives the performance of his career as Jack Sparrow, followed by a great scrip which is witty, slick and a refreshment in the movie industry followed by a great soundtrack. He is backed up with the handsome blacksmith, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the beautiful governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Australia's very own Geoffrey Rush who plays the cursed Captain Barbossa. All the main characters were excellent. Once the movie begins it doesn't let up until the credits roll. The sword duels, special effects were fantastic, ship battle and even the romance between Will and Elizabeth is sweet.Since this movie was based on a theme park ride at Disneyworld I thought little of it at the time, until I went to see it at the cinema. I was completely blown away and to me it became an instant classic, how refreshing. I say well done Gore for creating a masterpiece in the industry. Yet another movie added to my collection.	5.0	""" I'm Captain Jack Sparrow"""	2007-07-24	0	0	0

The plot line is fun and imaginative, the writing well done, the special effects are wonderful, but the real reason this film works is the casting. Every actor does a fine job with his/her role, in particular Geoffrey Rush, but the instant Johnny Depp sails on screen, you're hooked into it. His swaggering performance was over-the-top, campy, and just absolutely perfect for the film. He was truly the heart and soul of the picture, and just may have given the best performance of his career. The only thing wrong with the movie to me, the climactic sword fight between Barbossa and Capt. Sparrow seemed a bit long and drawn out, but that's a minor quibble in an otherwise fine film. Is it the best film of the year? No. Is it memorable? Certainly. It's fun to think that pirate movies, once the heart of Hollywood action long dead, are now back in favor and more are planned. Get this fine film and enjoy a fine Hollywood throwback thrill-ride!	5.0	Drink Up, Me Hearties, Yo-Ho!	2005-01-12	3	3	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A21B2TJBWCSK1R	Cubist	The Pirates of the Caribbean is one of those wonderful surprises that comes out of left field. It is a rare oddity--a big budget studio film that actually is able to balance style and content. The DVD set does much the same thing. While there is not as much substance in the extras, there is enough material to keep fans busy and it does keep with the look and mood of the movie.The first DVD features not one but three audio commentaries. The first (and best) one is with director Gore Verbinski and actor Johnny Depp. This is a relaxed, conversational track as the two men joke around and hint at a very chaotic shoot with Verbinski admitting that he was hesitant to sign on to a film based on a Disney ride-would it have an actual story or just be a two-hour ad?The second audio commentary is split between actors Jack Davenport and Keira Knightley and an interview with producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Their commentaries are for selected scenes, which cuts down on the dead air. The actors' track is filled with dry, self-deprecating humour but it feels like Knightley is trying too hard to be &quot;on&quot; and comes off as annoying. Bruckheimer's track is the epitome of business-like but is actually quite engaging because it is so informative.Lastly, the film's screenwriters contribute a commentary. Subtitles that identified who was speaking at any given time would've been a nice option.The second DVD contains a treasure trove of supplemental material. One of the highlights is &quot;An Epic at Sea,&quot; a 37-minute documentary on various elements that make up the movie, from casting to visual effects to the world premiere. While a bit on the fluffy side, it does convey the huge scope of the production and the challenges inherit with such an endeavour.&quot;Diaries&quot; is another stand-out extra that looks at the production from three different points of view. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is an avid photographer who loves to take pictures on the sets of his movies and he talks rather eloquently over a montage of them. Actor Lee Arenberg, who played one of the cursed Black Pearl pirates, presents a fun snapshot of his experiences working on the film. Lastly, there is a so-so look at the life of the one real ship that was used in the film.On a more educational note, is the surprisingly good &quot;Below Deck,&quot; a virtual reality tour of a pirate ship that allows one to click on various parts for informative factoids of the time period and aspects of pirate life by a historian.There are many more extras to look through but these were the highlights for me.

Geoffry Rush, Orlando Bloom(Lord of The Rings) Johnny Depp, and Kira Knightley. She's in Love Actually, and I would watch her anytime. She's a good young actress also very beautiful. Listen to the commentaries, and you'll hear about (pout 1, pout 2, and pout 3,). She has a sense of humor people. The extras on the Dvd are an added bonus.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	One of those movies I've been chomping at the bit to review since it's release, `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is what a top notch Hollywood blockbuster looks like; both visually stunning and completely entertaining, with a plot and characters we can care about coupled with special effects to put Spielberg to shame and humor that'll keep the entire family rolling with laughter.  `Pirates' may in fact be that all around perfect film, one that everyone can enjoy with absolutely no reservations.  It's about time Hollywood gave us something this complete.As Captain Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp worked hard for that Oscar nod without every really working at all.  His performance I guaranty you was not one he was campaigning for an Oscar, it's far too natural for that, and that's why I feel so overjoyed about his nomination.  It's not a performance that the Academy all too often notices for it has nothing they look for yet it proved to be everything they needed to award.  Becoming completely absorbed in his character he's almost unrecognizable here, and that what sets Depp apart from most of the pack in the first place, dire dedication and devotion to a role.The plot here revolves around a group of undead pirates trying to break the curse that binds them in their `undead' state.  The leader of this group is Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who now commands The Black Pearl, a ship once belonging to Jack Sparrow.  In an attempt to reverse this curse they kidnap the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) and this leaves her father, Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), up in arms.  Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the blacksmith who secretly pines for Elizabeth's attention, is determined to find her and so he enlists the help of Sparrow (who's determined solely to regain command of his ship) in order to track down the undead and rescue his love.As I said, this film has everything you could wish for in a motion picture.  It has the action and adventure, plenty of eye candy (I personally prefer the gorgeous Keira Knightly but my wife is a major fan of Depp here), one liners and general hilarious scenes and did I mention those brilliantly slick special effects.  All the performances are great, Depp the standout as well as Rush who is splendidly iconic, but it was probably the biggest booster for young talent Keira Knightly who I'm sure was instantly noticed, not just for her beauty but also her dynamic chemistry with the screen.  A must see adventure for any fan of pirates, swashbuckling or just plain fun!	5.0	A pirates life for EVERYONE!	2006-12-15	4	4	0

The ONE thing I didn't like about it is the inside of the jacket has white ash and smells as though the owner smoked a pipe. The smell is now gone since it's been here a few days at least. I love how the movie has at least a fair amount of humor and a good story. I loved this series as a kid, even though I didn't really understand the movies at the time. I just don't like how green screens become more obvious the second time you watch a movie you really enjoy, though. And I do wish they had more humor though, I mean it's Johnny Depp for crying out loud! There shouldn't be one seen he's in that something funny doesn't happen, which I believe every seen he's in he does or says something idiotic or witty. So an awesome movie. I mean, some of the dialect I do not understand, but all in all a wonderful series.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1R8AO9XASQ15C	Daniel A. Marsh	&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; is nowhere near as good as its box office tally might indicate, but it does make an enjoyable evening's entertainment.I've never taken the ride itself, so I can't compare the movie to its so-called &quot;source material&quot; (what's next, a movie based on the back of a cereal box?). And I am no fan of Jerry Bruckheimer, whose &quot;Bad Boys&quot; movies and &quot;Armageddon,&quot; among other cinematic debacles, were repulsive.But &quot;Pirates&quot; succeeds largely on the strength of its acting. Johnny Depp turns in the first &quot;subtly hammy&quot; performance I've ever seen as Capt. Jack Sparrow, truly a memorable character. Orlando Bloom has that whole Errol Flynn thing going on, and Geoffrey Rush is in fine form as the dread pirate Barbossa.The special effects are sometimes admirable, though the CGI sometimes feels lifted from &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (that's not a compliment). I dunno, the whole &quot;pirates who are actually dead guys (well, they're sorta dead) who turn to skeletons in the moonlight&quot; thing smacks of cheese, but then I thought &quot;Gladiator&quot; was just a bad B-movie, so I'm sure there will be plenty who disagree.Gore Verbinski's passionate, energetic direction is another saving grace. On the whole, &quot;Pirates&quot; looks a lot better than some of Steven Spielberg's more recent work. The cinematography, set design, sound effects and art direction are stunning. Not &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; level, but quite good, nonetheless.I'm not a big fan of this movie, but it's sort of a guilty pleasure, sort of like &quot;Waterworld.&quot; Three stars and that's it.	3.0	The acting carries the movie	2003-12-28	3	2	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A169I83JL8QJGN	Daniel A Moir	I'm pretty excited about the movies that have come out this year. It's been a great year, and Pirates of the Caribbean was the icing on the cake for me for a year filled with all kinds of goodies. Perhaps my pre-conceived notion that a movie based upon a ride at Disneyland couldn't possibly be good, but it was! Not only that, but it was great! While I wasn't impressed with the movie as a special effects film the acting and dialogue of this film were simply enchanting. Johnny Depp was simply amazing showing off his brilliance as an actor capable of many different kind of rolls, its little wonder he has so many fans across both genders, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I can be counted among them! Orlando Bloom did amazing as well; proving there is life for him after Lord of the Rings, and Kierra Knightly.... was she really only 17 when the film was made? She acts with a maturity well beyond her years, possessing both elegant beauty, and extreme talent. Such amazing talent, and such effort was put into this film that it was more than apparent that the movie was a labor of love for the crew. The only problem with the film that I have is a political side note, in that I am an advocate of anti-piracy efforts, the &quot;moral of the story&quot; at the end of the film was kinda poorly worded. I know the idea was to have the law decide to overlook the &quot;crime&quot; because the end result was good, however the film writers seemed to inadvertently endorse piracy which is a huge problem costing several entertainment and software industries billions (software companies loose a total of just under 12 billion every year alone). It makes me wonder how many pirated copies of this film are out there, or if the writers would have written the final scenes if they understood how dire the situation has really gotten. I'm okay with making pirates the heroes, this movie was simply put wonderful, I enjoyed it immensely, but the ending seemed a bit like a pro-piracy lecture to an extent. Politics aside, I am eagerly awaiting the sequel, and keeping my fingers crossed for the return of Johnny Depp in his amazing role in this film.	4.0	I wonder how many pirated copies of this movie there are...?	2004-01-30	2	0	2

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	"When Elizabeth, the daughter of Port Royal's governor is kidnapped by the crew of The Black Pearl, a legendary ship whose crew are demonic and invincible, blacksmith William Turner, who has a crush on Elizabeth, but can't express it due to his class standing, is forced to turn to Jack Sparrow, an imprisoned pirate waiting for the gallows, for help.  Sparrow promises to take him to the Pearl and ""his bonnie lass"" in exchange for springing him out.  Johnny Depp singlehandedly carries this movie as Jack Sparrow, giving an eccentric, slightly manic, fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants attitude.The reason for Elizabeth's kidnapping becomes apparent.  Seems that she holds the key to removing a curse the pirates of the Black Pearl are all under.  She seems to manage herself pretty well from the time of her capture.  Not only does she boldly dictate the rules of parley of two goofy pirates with bad teeth, one with a glass eye, but she does stand up to the menacing Captain Barbosa, the leader of the pirate crew, played by Geoffrey Rush.  Keira Knightley (Elizabeth) has a busy year, appearing as Jules in Bend It Like Beckham and also appearing in Love Actually.  Apart from Depp, she's the only other performer who shines out.Sparrow is quite a colourful character to the bland Turner.  He's a good swordfighter, clever with words and ploys, and helps Turner become more seaworthy and pirate savvy.  He's also a bit of a cad, what with the women who slap him, to which remarks on whether or not he deserved that slap.  With an impish manic gleam in his eye, he is a bit of a clown.  Tanned from his years as a pirate, that's not all that sets him aside from the lily-white British.  His long black hair is in dreads of a sort, decked with beads, even his goatee is split in three.  He's styled as quite the dandy like Errol Flynn, but I doubt if the latter wore eye makeup.Another theme that comes through is the code the pirates have among themselves.  Apart from the rule of parley, where hostilities are ceased to make way for negotiations, there's also the rule that if a pirate doesn't return within a certain time, he's left behind.  What differentiates this code from the standard rules of British society is that the codes are just a guideline, which can be good or bad, but it shows how more flexible and freer pirates are, depending on, again, how good or bad they are.The realization of the ghoulish pirates are a special effects triumph, grotesque as they are.  That aside, the action sequences are nothing special, and the scenes of constant escapes and recaptures are a bit much.  Other debits in this movie include the padding that contributes to its overlength.  Certain adventure movies utilize that extra to enhance this film and this isn't one of them.  And the characters of Elizabeth's father and the commodore are cardboard cut-outs embodying the hierarchical mindset of Britain's upper crust society and military elite, and as such, their only purpose seems to serve as a direct contrast to outsiders such as Sparrow and his associates.Put something strong in your rum and then maybe it'll merit a four star rating."	3.0	Depp and Kneightley are the only treasures in so-so movie.	2003-11-25	13	1	12

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1EFS5PV3HOFDI	"Danielle Muller ""Shulamith"""	"This was the first movie that I had ever watched of Johnny Depp, and I must admit it was not to be my last. There is just something so energetic and sauve about him.Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie not to be missed from the moment you strap onto this thrill ride until the very end. It is a movie that faithfully follows the pirate monopoly during that time period, all the while making fun of it in the worst way! Who would have thought that a mere ride of Disney's could have spawned such a movie! Certanly not the average person.Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly and Geoffry Rush follow closely on the heels of Johnny Depp playing the dapper, swaggering Jack Sparrow. A man who a few years hence had been marooned on a desert island when a mutiny led by his first mate erupted. Jack recieved a pistol with one bullet, ""To end his misery."" Fortunatly for us, there was no need for Sparrow to have such use for his Pistol.He escapes and ends up on a british ruled island whose commander is dead set on routing out all pirates from the southern seas. And he does not take kindly to the untimely appearence of Jack. Enter Orlando Bloom, who is a lovesick apprentice and is swooning over the governers daughter. Keira Knightly. Bloom and Depp meet and from that moment forth you have the movie layed out for you. What occures and transpires will leave you laughing and gasping for breath. As the trills and humor come thick and fast. The music is awesome, and the CGI is pretty cool. Although I don't think the Black pearl was a CGI, it was still pretty awesome. Anyhow, don't wait to rent this movie, just buy it. There is absolutely no way that you could go wrong."	5.0	Who would have thunk it?	2005-04-13	2	1	1

The characterizations are a wonderful blend of light-comedy and earnest genre work.  Depp and Rush keep the mood light enough so the other principles can play it mostly straight.  At times it really reminded me of ""The Princess Bride"" in its style and feel - witty but well-made.The film does run a bit too long, not that it can't sustain the humor and action, but parts seem extraneous.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1HX00DL0SZM1G	"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer"""	Let me first of all address one of the things that is misleading in the list of special features. Fans of Keira Knightley and Jack Davenport who may be excited to listen to a full-length feature commentary by the two English stars will be disappointed. Much like the DVD `The Girl Next Door' which promises an audio commentary from Elisha Cuthbert  and Emile Hirsch, what we have here instead is several scenes in which the two actors comment - though at least with Pirates of the Caribbean the two actors were obviously recorded together and the selection of scenes is more extensive.Okay, now onto discussion of the movie itself - and what a fun ride it is (unlike the rather ho-hum DisneyWorld ride from which it takes its name and reportedly inspiration). Stealing the show and dominating every scene in which they appear is Johnny Depp as Capt. Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, what we have is possibly the best pirate movie since such productions were in their heyday with such fun filled swashbucklers as `The Crimson Pirate.' Forget more recent pretenders such as `Cutthroat Island' and the truly terrible Matthau vehicle `Pirates', this movie shows that Hollywood can still assemble a good cast and spin a pirate yarn that is both enjoyable, thrilling and well written.The plot concerns the effort by Depp's character to recapture his former ship The Black Pearl from his former shipmate and mutineer Capt. Barbossa. The curse of the title involves Barbossa and his crew being in a perpetual state of undead (cue some pretty nifty special effects) and new meaning to the term `skeleton crew.' Barbossa seems understandably anxious to rid himself of the curse (though why I am not so sure since it certainly gives him and his crew an edge in battle) and searches for a doubloon necklace that hangs around the neck of the beautiful Governors daughter Elizabeth Swann (Knightley).One thing that did surprise me is that Depp does not play the romantic lead in this movie, deferring that part instead to Orlando Bloom as blacksmith Will Turner who vies for Elizabeth's affection with the Jack Davenports snobbish Cmdr. Norrington. Of course there are no prizes for guessing who will win out in the end.One reviewer commented on the movie playing out like a wild Halloween party on the high seas. While this is true of many of the scenes in this movie there are some quiet moments and more traditional action movie moments to imbue this flick with a comfortable sense of familiarity for any of those who grew up watching the pirate adventures of yesteryear on Saturday afternoon television. It's a great ride and wonderful news that a sequel is currently in the works.Although a three-disc edition of this movie is upcoming in November I opted for this 2-disc set and was mightily impressed by the special features. Aside from the slight disappointment noted at the beginning of this review, I relished the extensive background into the history of pirates. As a person longtime fascinated with the role of these high seas rogues I found the information both fascinating and enjoyable.I also quite liked the 40-minute making of... documentary that included interviews with most of the principal actors (yes including Knightley) and a look at how many of the visual effects and computer effects were created. Together with a selection of deleted and extended scenes and blooper reel, the decision on if to purchase this or wait for the 3-disc set is purely a judgement call on how many features you want. But I can vouch that this 2-disc set will leave you truly satisfied - aside from the Knightley/Davenport commentary.	5.0	Flick that delivers high seas adventure after long absence	2004-10-29	12	9	3

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ADVX0P3EIKWBK	Darth Wader	The first Pirates of the Caribbean proved that Disney still has the ability to make high quality live action movies.  And the reasons are this: great actors/characters and a great storyline.  Sounds simple but too often we see actors that are miscast in movies.  Not in this case.  Johnny Depp IS Jack Sparrow, and after this great performance (he's like Keith Richards, ha!), you would not want to see it any other way.  He has the walk and talk down on a great character and his ensemble shines as well.  Orlando Bloom proves that he is more than just a LOTR elf and this was the first movie I saw with the gorgeous Kiera Knightley (not counting her playing the body double of Natalie Portman in Star Wars Episode One).  Both Orlando and Kiera are excellent and help Johnny Depp carry the movie.  My only complaint is the movie seemed VERY, VERY long, but it was very enjoyable.  A lot of good special effects although various crew members can be seen throughout!  Although Disney execs were scared at how well Depp's performance would go over, I would say they are now laughing all the way to the bank!  Risk equals reward!	4.0	First Introduction to Kiera Knightley makes this more than worth the price of the DVD!	2006-07-10	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2MW0RYIXMEYGS	Dave	"Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, hubba hubba) is a blacksmith in the town of Port Royal. He and the governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) share a mutual love, but in the classic story setup, a more ideal husband, a Captain in the Navy, also has his eye on her. Enter Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who is just about guaranteed to hit you with a stroke of laughter from his first appearance, and keeps it up for the rest of the movie. He's a pirate and a scalawag, but proves he's not all bad when Elizabeth passes out because of an over-tight corset and plummets into the ocean. Sparrow dives to the Depps (sorry, I mean depths) to rescue her, but since he's a pirate, he is met with hostility from the Captain, Governor and their British troops nonetheless. Sparrow then uses Swann as a hostage to escape, and dodging the ensuing manhunt, he ducks inside Will Turner's blacksmith shop. Turner and Sparrow have a duel but the soldiers catch up with Sparrow, and take him to prison. That night, a dark ship sails into harbor, bearing murderous pirates that pillage and plunder the town. Their point of interest, however, is the governor's mansion, specifically the gold medallion that Elizabeth wears around her neck. The gold calls to the pirates (shades of The One Ring here), being the last piece of an ancient treasure. They capture Elizabeth and take her on board their ship, The Black Pearl. Will wants to go after the ship, but everyone else knows it's a suicide errand. Will springs Depp in exchange for his help, and the two of them set sail to rescue Elizabeth.BAD: One might expect that, with cutlasses, parrots and pirates, this would be a film no worse than Lord of the Rings. However, despite having been warned from previews, the scenes with the cursed skeletal crew belong more in a horror flick than in a Disney action movie. There are several moments where the shock attempts are obvious, but effective. A disembodied skeletal hand, severed from its owner, crawls after a man. One pirate continually fiddles with a glass eyeball, which he drops, rolls around, pulls in and out, and even gets a fork impaled in at one point. The skeleton crew often appear in their human form, then step into moonlight which morphs them into undead. Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) in his skeletal form guzzles wine, which leaks down his skeletal throat before our very eyes, drenching his ribs and spine and pelvis and legs before spilling on the deck. Elizabeth stabs Barbosa in his human form with a knife, which he looks at half-interestedly before yanking it out of his chest. Directly after that is the most graphic scene of the pirates, all in skeletal form, as Elizabeth is pushed out among them is pushed around. Definitely destined to cause some nightmares if your little buccaneers are allowed to watch. The violence comes in the form of generally non-bloody stabbings etc. The pirates invade a town and kill and rampage at will  -- and at Will! Will throws a tomahawk at one pirate, which appears to kill him, but Will later encounters the same pirate. We see Elizabeth get slapped brutally by a rather orc-like pirate, and later we see her hand sliced and the slightly bloody result. We see someone get shot with a pistol, and a close-up of the hole in the shirt from which blood quickly seeps out. There's no immorality, but there are a few suggestive phrases. The pirates threaten that unless Elizabeth dines with the captain privately, then she'll dine with the whole crew and she will be naked. (She dines with the captain) A few women in revealing dresses slap Jack when he arrives on the pirate haven of Tortuga. There are some swear words as well, but most of them were muttered so that I failed to catch them.GOOD: Will is truly a hero, a handsome young fellow (a fact which won't escape most teenage female viewers) who works hard at an honest trade. He displays a hatred for pirates, and attempts to fight for his city. When he learns Elizabeth was  kidnapped, he is daringly goes after the dreaded Black Pearl to save her, telling Jack he is willing to die for her. He fights heroically, and sacrificially to save Elizabeth. Jack is of course, a scoundrel, but as I said, he demonstrates his quality by saving Elizabeth,  proving he does have a good side to him. And of course, he'll keep the laughs rolling throughout the film as well.THOUGHTS:  You don't have to have ridden Disney World's Pirates of the Caribbean ride to enjoy this movie, but if you have, you'll recognize a few elements. While trying to escape from prison by coaxing a key-holding dog, prisoners are chided by Jack, saying ""that dog is never going to move"", a reference to the Disney ride. Surprisingly, the attraction's main theme, A Pirate's Life for Me doesn't make but a brief mention in the film, when Jack sings a few snatches of the tune and pledges to teach his whole crew to sing it, ""and then we'll sing it all the time.""As for whether or not the movie is worth buying ... well, I'm hoping that the sequel might perhaps be a little more worth it to see than this. I like the action, and swashbuckler adventure, but it comes with all the ghoulish thrills of the Haunted Mansion, which is just a little too high of a cost. There's a reason a lot of folks don't like Halloween or horror flicks, and I look with regret at the fact that I soaked up the spooks along with the fun. For those families concerned about how wholesome a film is, I would regrettably recommend you probably shouldn't watch this. At the very least, not with the kids."	3.0	A pirate movie?

Depp doing a high budget, Jerry Bruckhiemer produced, Disney inspired ride movie? However all my worries desserted me when I saw the film. It was a great movie with a dynamite cast and a good enough script to go along with it. Depp was so convincing as Captain Jack Sparrow that it didn't even look like he was acting at all. This movie made me feel like a kid again. Just the way &quot;The Goonies&quot; does whenever I see it. After watching the film I went to Disneyland a few weeks later. Usually when I go on the ride the line is 10 minutes. However this time I had to wait 2 hours, and I had a fast pass. There was something about the ride that was different, but in a good way. The movie made me enjoy the ride 10 times more than I had ever before. I was hoping that Captain Jack Sparrow would be in the attraction. Now there will be a sequel, that is undeniable considering this movie made $300 million plus at the box office. But I just hope that it at least is half as good as this one.	5.0	A Pirates Life For Me	2004-02-14	4	4	0

Its unique theme keeps its audiences entertained the entire time.  Its plot was written wonderfully.  Its combination of comedy, romance, and action blend as one movie brilliantly.  Few other movies have mastered this difficult task.  The fights between the good pirates and the bad pirates never lose the action edge.  The romance theme adds more intensity to the action portions.  The characters' survival are more crutial due to the love.Johnny Depp, especially, wonderfully offers his own humor into this movie.  His unforgettable behavior alone gives this movie the unforgettable comedy experience.  All the other actors also perform their roles wonderfully: Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush.  Their personalities heighten the movie's genre characteristics wonderfully.  Without them, this experience wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable.The special effects look realistic.  The ships sailing, the gun shooting scenes, and many others could be easily mistaken for a real pirate war.  The characters' switch from human flesh to only skeleton never faulters.  No special effect is ever cheated, even the minor ones.""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is highly enjoyable for those of all ages.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"This film despite it's astronomical box office grosses is an average picture.  It's not a bad picture just not a particularly great one.  What redeems this film is the acting of the principle performances particularly Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.  Depp is one of those rare performers who can appear in an average vehicle and make it seem more than average.  The swagger and comic nuances of his character make it obvious as to why he FINALLY received an Oscar nomination.  Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush also give stand-out performances here.  Orlando Bloom is the only principle actor who does not leave an impression.  It leads one to believe that essentially he's just this month's pretty boy who is fortunate enough to appear in some high-profile films (""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""Troy).  Why do I say this film is just average?  The story is mundane.  The special effects are nice but if they don't enhance the story, so what?  Basically, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is the flavor of the month.  If you don't believe me, see how this film ranks in the public's subconscious in about five years.

Vasser	Pirates is the best film of 2003 thus far, since LOTR-ROTK isn't out at this writing.  Johnny Depp owns the character Jack Sparrow now and forever.  No one could ever could do a better job with that role.  Mr. Depp delivered an absolutely stunning performance that will for generations stand as one of the most memorable movie characters ever.  I've never underestimated Mr. Depp, but I was caught completely off guard opening day and left in awe that any actor could be that good, that real, that genuine.  If Mr. Depp does not win an Oscar, there simply is no justice on Earth.  Depp is astonishing every second he is on screen, which is most of the film.  Orlando Bloom's &quot;Will Turner&quot; is more or less just a comic foil for Captain Sparrow than anything else.  Turner is a pirate wannabe with a heart of gold.  Many could have played that part and I'm glad that Mr. Bloom got the chance to prove he could do more than just look cool in a white wig with a bow and arrow in the LOTR films.  Keira Knightly displays exceptional grace and emotional talent as the poor little rich girl.  Don't overlook the other standout performance from the great Geoffrey Rush, whose Barbossa character is the most stereotypical pirate of the bunch.  Barbossa is a more than worthy villain who relentlessly taunts all three heros.  Barobossa will give younger children many nightmares.  Tight script, flawless sets, authentic costumes, just right music and great location work add to the top notch quality.  The surprise ending at the conclusion of the credits was sheer genius.  An instant classic you can watch a dozen times.

Eastwood	As a happy-ending adventure comedy, this is one of the cleverest and funniest I have seen. Rather than comment on the whole film, I'll limit myself to one character in one scene. Johnny Depp, of course, steals the movie from his co-stars (as the cover pic on the DVD acknowledges). His entrance into the harbor was well worth the price of admission to the theater, where I first saw the film. We get TWO side-spitting sight-gags in the scene, even before Depp speaks to a living soul. The beauty of watching this film on DVD is that you can replay that scene and any others to your heart's content (including slow motion). AND you can switch on the subtitles in case you don't hear some dialogue for whatever reasons. The DVD set includes a whole array of extras: historical stuff about real pirates, deleted scenes, out-takes (bloopers), comments by cast members, and info about how dozens of things were planned and achieved, including the sea battles, the actors' make-up and costumes, the elaborate sets, the fencing scenes, and of course the wonderful digital special effects. Granting that a 5-star rating for an adventure comedy is LESS than a 5-star rating for a serious film (but more than a 5-star rating for a goofy Leslie Nielsen parody), it is a strong recommendation for people who are in the mood for that sort of entertainment. A lot of care and thought went into the making of this film, and all who made it have every right to be proud of the result!	5.0	The Best Thing to Come from Disney in Decades	2003-12-21	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3Q80Q6YFP5W6Q	David Roy	"Johnny Depp is a god.  Geoffrey Rush is the same but in a different way.  Put them on screen together in an action picture based on a Disney ride, and you get a lot more than you would normally bargain for.  Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the result of this dangerous combination.  Get ready for a wonderful ride, though, because this movie is a blast.  It succeeds on every level it tries to achieve.The plot can actually get a little convoluted as the movie goes on.  Twists and turns, changing loyalties and double (or even triple!) crosses abound.  Basically, young Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly), daughter of the governor of Port Royal (Jonathan Pryce), helps rescue a boy adrift at sea.  She finds a medallion that indicates he's a pirate, but she hides it from her father and the Navy for fear of the boy being hung.  Years later, that boy has grown into Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith who is besotted with her.  Captain Jack Sparrow (Johhny Depp) comes to port in order to steal a ship, having been marooned by his crew on a deserted island.  The Black Pearl, now captained by his former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), attacks Port Royal, in search of the medallion.  It seems the medallion is the key to a curse that's affecting the Black Pearl, one that Barbossa is determined to end, even if it means spilling the blood of a beautiful English woman.  Will and Jack have to chase them down and stop them before it's too late.That's just an introduction to the plot, but I don't want to spoil anything further.  I found the details of the curse even more horrible because I hadn't heard about it.  If you really want to know, many other reviewers (even Ebert) have said that much.  It's not a complicated plot, but it does move along at a fast pace.  I have seen several people ask questions that are (to me) quite obviously answered in the movie but were easily missed.  You don't need to think deeply about it, but you do need to pay attention.This, however, is an action flick, so the action is the key that makes up for a few logical inconsistencies.  And what glorious action it is!  Swashbuckling swordfights, explosions, creatures from beyond the grave, it's all here in abundance.  Some of the fights go on a bit too long (especially the climactic fight), but it's certainly never boring.  The choreography (especially in the fight between Bloom and Depp) is simply wonderful.  The special effects are fabulous, but they don't drown out the actual movie.  They are incorporated into the plot seamlessly, dazzling you but not distracting you.  The CGI with the skeletons (especially when they dance in and out of the moonlight) is breathtaking, and I certainly didn't notice any little mistakes there.  The ship to ship action (both firing on each other and grappling) make you feel like you are there.  The picture is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, so you know it's going to be loud.  You won't be disappointed.  It is quite loud.  If you find that a bad thing, you may want to skip this.The acting is simply marvelous from the main characters.  Knightly is suitably aristocratic as the governor's daughter, and she warms quite nicely into an action heroine as the movie goes on.  Bloom is very good as well in his second major role since Lord of the Rings.  I hope he doesn't get typecast into action movies, though.  However, Depp and Rush just run away with everything in this movie.  They play it perfectly, as only skilled actors can do.  If they play it over the top, it would destroy the movie and make it a parody.  If they play it too straight, the movie would be laughable in its earnest seriousness.  Instead, they combine the too, adding some outlandish humour but keeping it just this side of camp.  Depp is hilarious as Captain Sparrow, who English Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) wrongly calls ""one of the worst pirates I've ever seen."" He has said in interviews that he based the character on a combination of Keith Richards homage and Pepe Le Pew.  I can definitely see it.  He has many laugh-out-loud moments.  Rush is perfect as the villainous Captain Barbossa.  He's dedicated to his men and to foiling the curse that they've been under.  He's not evil incarnate, and Rush does give him some depth, mainly through facial expressions and how he says things.  He's desperate to feel human again, and he's determined to do what it takes, no matter what the consequences.While I love Jonathan Pryce, I don't think his character was fleshed out enough, and he had a couple of moments that just didn't seem to work.  It's not that Pryce overdid it, but it's the writing of the character that I thought was off.  When rescued from the pirates attacking his ship, he taunts them happily with hand gestures and words that just seemed out of character for him.  While Pryce did a strong job, I thought his character was the weakest of the main ones, followed closely by Norrington.Overall, I have to give Pirates a full five stars.  While there are a couple of inconsistencies or things not explained (how did Gibbs become a pirate when he was serving on a British ship 7 years earlier?), the movie quickly makes you forget that so you can enjoy the ride.  Most movies made from Disney attractions look very bland and boring, but this one raises the bar high for upcoming pictures.  And you know there will be some. In the meantime, enjoy this one.  Forget the Disney roots and revel in what is probably the funnest movie of the summer(...)"	5.0	A disney ride.  A good movie?  How can this be?	2003-09-02	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A12S8U5RHMIFRE	Dawn Aiello	"Yes, this movie was based on a ride at Disneyland, but that PARTICULAR ride was never one that I really considered as a ""thrill ride""--did you?  However, the MOVIE is a different story--it is INDEED a thrill ride!! When I first took my teenage children to see the movie (who loved it, also), I admit that I was expecting the movie to be ""good"", but not necessarily ""GREAT"".  Well, I was PLEASANTLY proven wrong!  This movie IS great!!  It was FUN, and it was FUNNY; it was a spectacular work of cinematography--the special effects are top notch; and even though it dragged just a little bit in the middle, and was just a little bit too long, it ended up being one of the few movies that, when I left the theatre, I had a smile on my face and felt as if I had TRULY gotten my money's worth.  This movie was all-around enjoyable, and it was a ton of fun, to boot!  Indeed--it was a THRILL RIDE!  For those of us that remember ""E Tickets"" at Disneyland, this movie definitely would require such a ticket! *smile*  I simply can not wait for the DVD to come out.

This film was the best of the summer. Johnny Depp should get an Oscar for his performance, well at least a Golden Globe. Johnny was fantastic. Orlando and Keira are the newest tag team in a wave of a &quot;British Invasion.&quot; Orlando with the Lord of the Rings films and Keira with Bend it like Beckham and Love Actually, these two actors' stars are rising fast with the talent to back their box office lurability. Not to mention Orlando is handsome and Keira is beautiful. Last but not least, Geoffrey Rush is the best villain on the high seas. AHRRrrgh! Apple anyone?Of course, I will be watching this DVD with several not-to-be-missed extras including 19 deleted or altered scenes, a blooper reel, and a script scanner until the next adventure is released. Read along the movie and see what lines were changed or omitted. The extras are great and easy to use for instance: Audio Commentaries from Cast and Film Makers. Change your appearance with the Special Effects Studio.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A30W676OPUAPC	"""day24"""	Now this film I really love. The story is superb, even though I had not expected it from a film adaptation of a theme-park ride. The special effects are amazing, the acting is fabulous, an overall thrill ride which takes you back to all the films you grew up with, repeated again and again. This is a pirate film with a twist, but still quite reminiscent of the Errol Flynn movies.The two stand-out performances of this film are undoubtedly Johny Depp, who has made it a career of selecting roles for himself which are not only very suitable, but in which he shines and steals the show. This time, however, he has heavy competition in that department. Orlando Bloom, known for his role as Legolas in the Lord of the Ring movies, dazzles the movie-goer with his acting capabilities, looks and fighting skills. It seems a romantic hero is born in this movie...lets hope Mr. Bloom can keep shining and outperforming his co-stars.The verdict? The only reason I wouldn't give this movie 5 stars is that I have seen a few better movies, in terms of story and other things. However, it is certainly one of the best movies I have seen this year! And well, as you can oly give full stars on Amazon, I'll give it all five...as I did truly love it...	5.0	Amazing!	2003-11-09	109	89	20

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AFG6W0IEZSABZ	D. Cronin	"POTC is definatly the best movie I have ever seen with stunning preformances by Johnny Depp (Capn' Jack Sparrow), Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) Geoffry Rush (Capn' Barbossa)and Kiera Knightly (Elizabeth Swann) along with some amazing special effects. I was amazed at how Gore Verbinski turned one of my all time favorite Disney rides into a major hit. I have already seen this movie twice and am planning on seeing it many more times in the future. Despite the classical portrayal of pirates in the film, the one thing that made the whole film worthwhile were the actors.Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was turned into the witty, rum loving pirate you can't help but love. His hillarious enter to the movie was the perfect starter for Jack, a pirate who ten years ago was left to die on a ""...God forsaken peice of land..."" is thrown into the gallows by Norrington (the rides portrayal of the pirates in the gallows tempting the dog with the keys in it's mouth is incorporated here)and later sprung out by blacksmith Will Turner after promising ""...on the pain of death..."" that he would take Will to the Black Pearl and his Bonnie Lass.Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is the more serious  blacksmith who when finding that Elizabeth Swann, his crush, has been kidnapped he enlists Jack's help to track down the black pearl, only to find out something about himself along the way.Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightly)is the beautiful governors daughter who is kidnapped by the dreaded Capn' Barbossa. Once on the Black Pearl she finds out that the crew is cursed by Aztec medallions causing them to be the living dead in a manner of speaking, the moonlight shows them for what they really are, living skeletons.Capn' Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) portrays the ""captain so evil that hell itself spat 'im back out"" who was formerly the first mate of Jack. Capn' Barbossa led the mutiny of Jack, was promoted to captain and led the crew on to the cursed treasure of Cortez.You must see this movie, it deserves no less then four stars and will have you going back to see it again and again.

Gore Verbinski (Director of the film) leads a great pack of actors which includes the underrated Johnny Depp playing the infamous pirate Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner the young Craftsman turned hero, the blosseming Keira Knightley as the governor's daughter & a very good performance by Geoffrey Rush as Capitan Barbosa doesnt hurt the cast much either...This film is not stop fun, the action is very apperent throughout and the same can be said about the comedy. I was 100% involved for the entire 143 minutes that it was playing. Johnny Depp's performance is astounding and should have been more seriously considered for the best actor award at the Oscars ... but I really dont think that it is Jack's Charactor is not the only thing that made the film so good. The collection of all of the witty comedy, non-stop suspense & action as well as some stunning special effects is what made the film so great. The film had great direction, a clever script and about as good of a cast as it could have hoped for ...Gore Verbinski is one director that I think deserves a little bit more credit. He made a very funny film in ""Mouse Hunt"", a very creepy movie in ""The Ring"" and an all around good job in the film at hand ...""Pirates of the Carribean"" will go down in history as being one of the great summer hits, the same can be said about Johnny Depp's wonderful performance playing Jack Sparrow..The second film is good but not as good as this one, though it is still very much entertaning ... the next few should be a blast, I cant wait!"	4.0	"""Yo-Ho Yo-Ho a Pirates life for me!"""	2006-07-24	5	3	2

Desantis ""djnj99"""	I have seen this movie twice and found it even funnier the second time around.  I am sure that had to do with the fact that the first time, I didn't realize Jack Sparrow's character was based loosely on Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones.  Johnny Depp does an amazing job.  I think because of his good looks, no one gives him the credit he deserves as an actor.  He's so smooth in this.  He didn't even have to speak to make the film funny.  He was Jack Sparrow.  Should he get the oscar?  It's hard to say because I haven't seen the other movies to compare. He should definetely get acknowledged in some way because his take on Jack Sparrow and his acting, were phenonmenal.  On another note, the filming was incredible.  It was such a beautiful mood piece.  It took you back to another time and place.  Coming from Disney, I was impressed.  Very enjoyable.	4.0	Performances are over the top!!!!!!	2004-02-06	5	3	2

The beginning was quite boring but a key point in the movie... It picked up very fast with comedy, drama, and action. The movie really picked up with Johnny came into view, he brought the movie to life. His acting in this film was the best I have seen (and I'm a BIG Johnny fan) If you just look at him talking to the other person he's ""in your face"" comedic ways bring laughter and make you want more and more.The acting from all the actors and yes actresses was fantastic, Orlando wasn't half bad either, comes to show that he will make it in films.The movie plot worked out well, filled with action and it had it's semi-scary scenes with the skeleton pirates. A few loopholes where in there but enough details to still keep you informed.The script worked out pretty well, even though long ( 2 hours 15 minutes) it was still worth it, the ending was eh sort of dissapointing but it left you happy because the action continued. I recommend this film to anyone, adult, kids, teens. Especially to a big Johnny Fan and yeah even the Orlando fans...I'm still at awe with this film and very pleased with the results.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AFEOC3D8WKN1D	Deirdre	"Many many years ago, the stories of pirates died in Hollywood, the interest and freshness just left it, and the name of swashbuckling piracy gathered dust in a box on a shelf in the back of a closet. Then, in 2003, Jerry Bruckheimer found the old box, dusted it off and said to himself ""Hey I could use this!"" And use it, he did.With an all-star cast and the best crew in town, Jerry set out to do the unthinkable, resurrect the pirate name. Many people, upon seeing the footage-less teaser trailer thought the film would be so bad it would be a joke, but the director, Gore Verbinki proved them all wrong.Through jolly musical themes, a suprisingly creepy plot, a fantastic cast, and awesome bits of nothing-but-fun action, Pirates of the Caribbean succesfully leaves the veiwer stunned, and wanting more (which, they brought, twice).If you liked Transformers, Night at the Musiem you will probably like this movie.8.5/10"	4.0	Where's all the rum gone?	2007-09-22	2	0	2

It does an outstanding job of creating the scenery and ambiance of what, in my mind, the real pirates would be like.  Of course it is a bit picturesque, but that is exactly what the ride is like and the movie, as a spin off from the ride at Disney, achieves its aim well.Depp is very good as Jack Sparrow, the shipless captain.  Depp plays a rocker type pirate, kind of a modern version of what a true good hearted pirate would be like.  On the other side, the cursed crew of the Black Pearl ship, which were condemned to eternal damnation in search of a stolen treasure.  Nevermind the usual good vs evil clich&eacute;s, but Depp is smart and convincing as the good pirate, while Geoffrey Rush is very good as the evil Capt Barbossa.  The special effects are also a highlight, especially of the undead pirates' images.Overall it is a fun movie, especially for the scenes that resemble (sometimes exactly trace) the images from the ride at Disney.  For example, there is a scene of Depp in prison trying to lure a dog to give him the key to his cell for a bone.  I recommend it as a light fun movie, with a feel good positive message in the end.	4.0	VERY PLEASANT SURPRISE, DEPP IS OUTSTANDING	2004-01-23	2	2	0

All I need is this DVD and someplace to watch it. I saw this in theaters 6 times because it was so good and I have been anxiously awaiting the DVD. People say women like this movie because of Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, and I say true, but I love their performance, not their looks (Although they are both attractive gentlemen). Johnny is at his comedic finest and you will not stop laughing and Orlando makes you root for the good guy even harder then normal and laugh at his comments that compliment Johnny's &quot;uniqueness&quot;. Geoffery Rush is phenomenal and so is the actor (I am blanking on his name, sorry sir, you were still awesome) who plays Commodore Norrington (he needs way more publicity, he was phenomenal as well)...This is by far the best movie of the year and without a doubt deserves awards for both content and actor performance. Knowing the Oscars, it will get overlooked, not enough &quot;big names&quot; in some over the top boring movie, so my vote goes to them by buying the DVD and encouraging others to buy it as well. Nothing says &quot;In your face&quot; to those who keep getting reconized for less then deserving work then getting surpassed in sales by &quot;box office poison&quot; Johnny Depp and his 'mates.	5.0	No plane needed, enjoy the ride at home,	2004-04-12	3	3	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AWN071NYAXUQ9	Devon	This movie is a comedy/adventure/action/romance all rolled into one. Johnny Depp is so hilarious and lets just say the makeup artist did a great job on that eyeliner!! Orlando Bloom did excellent also with the sword fighting and romance parts. Keira Knightley was so lucky to be able to work on this movie with them, and she did excellent also playing the helpless maiden at first and then beginning to do the action scenes. The movie had me giggling all the way through. Captain Barbosa was my favorite kind of villian the scary yet funny type. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was the funniest character I've seen in any movie! Will Turner (Bloom) was trying to rescue his love Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) and the plot was just the greatest!	5.0	Best Pirate Movie Ever	2003-08-17	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2LUJINJYU5G9E	Dextra L. Suggs	I think Johnny Depp is one of the most courageous performers working today. To go out on a limb (modeling the character after Keith Richards) without the complete blessing of the studio took guts. As with most Depp creations he leaves an unforgettable impression on the audience. When you team him up with a cast of talent that includes Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush well you can guess the rest. Bloom is developing into a convincing performer, Knightley, despite her beauty, is a surprisingly talented and unselfish actress and I think Geoffrey Rush is incapable of delivering a poor performance. And although her appearance was brief, whoever cast Thandie Newton as a pirate was a genius. The story was great and the special effects were even better. Get yourself a big bag of popcorn and an eye patch, sit back with the kids and enjoy because this movie delivers!	4.0	I'm Jack Sparrow, savvy!	2007-05-18	2	2	0

Hartley	Johnny Depp is in top form as the U-Boat commander in this seafaring classic. Russell Crowe is equally stunning (although a bit foppish, which I found to be an interesting acting choice) in his depiction of Lt. Christian. Although I found the subplot about the love affair between Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslett a bit distracting, the film was redeemed by its massive restaging of the Battle Of Midway, with a memorable cameo by Ben Affleck as a kooky yet dedicated Kamikaze pilot (look fast to catch Ben before he bursts into a ball of flames!). DVD notes: The Def Jam documentary about the influence that the &quot;Pirates Of The Caribbean&quot; ride at Disneyland has had on the hip-hop community is fascinating. The extra feature about the making of the product tie-in deal with the fast food chains really adds some extra quality time sitting in front of your T.V.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3EJYJC25OJVKK	"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer"""	"I was so blown away when I finished seeing the movie ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl"" even with the high expectations from hearing all of the excellent reviews that this movie got and let me tell you, this movie deserves every great review that it gets. This is one of the best movies of 2003 and this DVD is a must-have. In so many ways ""Pirates"" is a major sweeping epic adventure that I have never seen before. I generally have not been a major fan of pirate movies until I saw this movie and you should not miss this DVD with all of the awesome extras on here.In a lot of ways, I view this movie as almost like two or three sub-plots all bound together into one amazing movie. I don't know about you but I sense that there were three small plots all in one movie but they all fit very well together on this sweeping epic adventure.The story unfolds where a British navy ship discovers a young boy named Will Turner barely alive in the ocean during the 1800s in the Caribbean Sea, and a young girl named Elizabeth Swann helps to rescue him from death after his ship was destroyed by unknown assailants. Elizabeth Swann is kidnapped by a fleet of rogue pirates and popular citizen, Will Turner, now a young man, partners up with a very unlikely ally named Jack Sparrow, a rogue menacing but friendly pirate named Jack Sparrow to save Elizabeth from the evil pirates. However, they soon realize that they are up against much worse enemies when it is discovered that the evil pirates are in an undead state, stuck between life and death and take the form of skeletons when exposed to the moonlight.Teaming up with Jack Sparrow, Will Turner fights against the evil undead pirate monsters to rescue Elizabeth Swann from their evil undead captain named Barbossa. Barbossa along with his evil fleet is seeking for a special artifact called ""The Black Pearl"" to bring him, and his pirate crew back to normal life as normal human beings and reclaim their power over the Caribbean. It is said that he is so evil that even Hell spit him right back out! Jack Sparrow on a personal note is also at war with Captain Barbossa to regain his long lost ship that was stolen from him many years ago.With all of these things, it is a long, dangerous but fun adventure as they aim to rescue Elizabeth Swann from Barbossa and prevent him from gaining a hold of the ""Black Pearl"".This movie succeeds on so many levels. TO me, this was one of the most unlikely success stories in movie history in recent years. Everyone involved in this project deserves the utmost praise that they have gotten. Although only in a relatively limited role, I thought that Jonathan Pryce was really funny as the bumbling Governor Swann and is a nice departure from the more traditionally villainous roles in his movies. Orlando Bloom also makes a nice departure away from the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise and is absolutely fabulous as the brave-hearted Will Turner. I thought that Elizabeth Swann was the best damsel in distress character that I've seen in many years.The twosome rival duo Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush though really stole the two halves of the spotlight on here. I really thought that Geoffrey Rush was absolutely fantastic as the vicious undead pirate Barbossa and Rush really brought the evil character to life on the big screen. It's so cool seeing Barbossa's eyes wide open when he's being cunning and planning his ambitious schemes. Johnny Depp was the absolute perfect choice for the role of the mentally twisted Captain Jack Sparrow. He really brings the oddball, twisted, demented, yet charming personality of Sparrow to life on the big screen. I felt that these two characters were what made this movie so much fun.Any remaining cast members I didn't mention also brought a lot of personalities into their character roles in this movie.The best thing I think that really made this movie so successful is that it takes the darkness of pirate movies but gives it a more comedic undertone to make it more fun and adventurous without robbing any of the personalities away from them. I felt that this is one of the rare cases where a movie blends adventure, comedy, and epic fun and results in a highly intelligent and strongly thought-out masterpiece! I felt that comedy in general has gone through a decline in recent years but this movie though gives comedy a much-needed facelift. The directing is amazing too and the sceneries are also spellbinding especially with the underwater scenes in some places. I think that they really put a lot of time into making this and really made a strong script out of it.The DVD edition is something that is NOT to be missed. The movie itself is a real masterpiece but disc two also contains some really cool features. My favorites are the ""Blooper Reel"" and the part that goes into the part that involves the films making. Some of the sets were absolutely amazing and one set for a particular scene in the movie particular really blew me away at its grand scale and size. There are many other features that are not to be missed on this DVD edition but these sections I felt were worth mentioning but everything else I didn't mention here with this review deserves a look as well.Whatever you do, do whatever you can to get a hold on this DVD. Forget the VHS. VHS's offer little of anything anymore these days and get damaged too easily. The DVD edition has lots of treats on it and should be included in any movie-goers collection. This is a really amazing movie and an awesome DVD to go along with it."	5.0	&quot;Pirates of The Caribbean&quot; is a 5 star masterpiece!	2004-03-10	0	0	0

No marketeer will ever label their movie as 'A mediocre not quite epic but you should see it anyway'.Pirates of the Caribean has been hyped but that does not make it a good or bad movie, I went to see it and came out smiling.The script isn't oscar material and the bad guys are clich&eacute; pirates to the bone (pun intended). There are some glitches in the story and not all characters have been developed well. Having said that, I loved the photography, Had a ball watching Johnny Depp turning Jack Sparrow into a character to remember, laughed at the (sometimes corny) jokes and found the busy ships fascinating.This is a pirate movie pur-sang, don't expect a phylosophical plot about good or bad, it doesn't really matter here.This is entertainment.Bottomline, this is a fun movie with beautifull scenes, a great role for Johnny Depp and a Disney feelgood ending.	4.0	See it - it is fun	2003-11-25	5	4	1

From the very beginning of this movie it is obvious that anyone with a penchant for silliness will absolutely love this film.  Johnny Depp's entrance is so ridiculously memorable I find myself smiling while writing about it.  I remember giggling uncontrollably when he finally pulls into port.  I won't ruin the scene for those who haven't seen it yet, but it is easily one of the funniest moments on film in 2003.  The production value of this film is top-notch.  From the costuming to the music, to the fight-scene choreography, this film completely shines.  There is the obligatory ""love interest"" that is classic Disney.  You know the plot: the blacksmith's apprentice falls madly in love with the princess (or in this case, an unattainable rich-man's daughter).  That minor predictability aside, this movie glows with great special effects and a career-making performance by Johnny Depp (aka ""The Sexiest Man Alive"").

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	Memo to Disney Studios:  If you're going to try to create a &quot;lovable rogue&quot; for an action/adventure movie, at least make him look like he's not on his way to a Revlon commercial.  In watching Johnny Depp prance and frolic through PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN I wasn't sure if I was watching a swashbuckler or the next segment of &quot;Martha Stewart Living.&quot;  I didn't know if the next sword fight would devolve into another rendition of Rocky Horror's &quot;Let's Do the Time Warp Again,&quot; or if Depp's character would magically morph into the latest manifestation of Divine (with braided goatee, of course).Yes, this movie has action, special effects, witty barbs, but to what end?  The characters are as one-dimensional as the robots on the Disney ride of the same name, and after the first fifteen minutes or so the mayhem and disarray become tiring.  And yes, Virginia, there is a plot, but it's as invisible as the air we breathe.PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN also stars a wooden Orlando Bloom (sans the Legolas blonde hair) and a nefarious Geoffrey Rush.  The makeup sure looked better on Keira Knightley than it did on Depp, but what's a silly pirate boy to do?&quot;Yo ho, yo ho, a blush of rouge for me!&quot;--D.

How wrong I was!

Johnny Depp is just plain wild, and he displays real comic genius in this film.  Also topping my list of favorite characters was the mutineer captain of the Black Pearl, whose name escapes me but whose bizarre character traits remain branded in my memory.

I thought it would go the way of most hyped-up summer blockbusters and be full of special effects but have absolutely zero story. However, I also expected nothing less than yet another brilliant performance from Johnny Depp.I guess I was half right. Depp was outstanding and has added yet another memorable character of Captain Jack Sparrow to a long list of other distinguished characters such as Ed Wood, Ichabod Crane, Gilbert Grape, and Hunter S. Thompson.Also excellent was Geoffrey Rush as Depp's nemesis. I think these two actors alone are responsible for taking what would have been a decent movie and making it a thoroughly enjoyable experience.And for those of you craving action, this movie delivers and then some! While this movie clocked in at just under 2 1/2 hours, I never once felt like it was dragging.Also worth checking out is the making-of documentary on the bonus disc. It is really fun and interesting to see exactly how much went into the making of this epic film, not to mention the entire crew's passion and overall enjoyment in participating in this project.If you are one of the few people out there that has not yet seen this film, you owe it to yourself to see what all the talk is about!	4.0	Exceeded My Expectations	2003-12-09	7	7	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ALF2MVINR0W20	Donna England	I just can't understand people complaining about this Film.Theres one thing I want to point out - I've read more than once that it has major 'Flaws' in it and things that don't make sense. Please someone tell me what because I see nothing? I think the problem is most people don't get why Jack Sparrow isn't a skeleton the entire way through, which means they can't have been watching it close enough when he picks up a coin half way through which turns him into one. Its not hard to figure when you think that hes going to fight Barbosa in a moment and doesn't want to die.Aside from the people who don't get it, I think its a great Film and I can't find anything wrong with it. People speaking badly about the 'English' woman in it annoys me like mad, I think Keira Knightley is better than ANY Hollywood Actress, shes got a natural charm about her and is stunning. I think she played the English rose portrayal beautifully. I think Orlando Bloom has improved and gone from strength to strength and as for Johnny Depp -I'm going to give him an entire paragraph. I think Johnny Depp made Jack Sparrow his own character, he completely got into it and its believable. To the people wondering what was going on and why he acted that way - Heres why. He always been different and this is his way of breaking away from what could have been a boring stereotypical Pirate. I think that the quirky style hes chosen is great, its a bit daring and slightly naughty but isn't that what Johnny Depp is so great at doing?Fantastic Film, its just fantastic and I can't say a bad thing about it.	5.0	Some people talk rubbish.	2004-05-03	3	1	2

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AW7MRR4CMF81N	Douglas VanderMeulen	This is a good, fun movie.  Though there is alot of special effects, unlike many modern movies, the story does not stand or fall on them.  There is a lot of great acting.  Depp got a best actor nomination and Rush certainly could have had best supporting actor nomination as well.  Depp just doesn't develop a character, but creates one.  His eyes, mannerisms and lines are wonderful.  If you like old Erroll Flynn movies, great music and wonderful special effects you won't want to miss this.  It is full of all sorts of rememberable lines that you will find yourself repeating.  Don't be fooled, there is a lot going on that you won't see until the second showing.  Plots, twists and story line are much more complex and the more you watch the more you will see.  This is a keeper.	5.0	Ol' Erroll Flynn meets high tech.	2004-06-21	6	5	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2EE77WXW35W0A	douglas w brumfield	If your a kid who likes pirates, this is your movie. Plenty of action and adventure on the high seas. If your a guy, youll like Keira Knightley. ( very pretty AND a good actress) If your a lady, well its Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. If your a real pirate, think again. The bonus features offer 10 , yes 10 , hours of extras including bios of real histoical pirates and a behind the scenes look at how they made the ships, costumes and characters as accurate as possible. Johhny Depp deserves the most praise as the sometimes inept pirate Jack Sparrow. A very interesting portrail of a pirate. If you like Johnny in this , also try From Hell or Sleepy Hollow. I didnt really think Mr. Depp was a very good actor, but I was VERY wrong. Sorry about that Captain Jack, please dont make me walk the plank.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1BCVPSEZ5NSXK	Doulos	".Warning: NOT FOR THE VERY YOUNG!!!.Summary:An enjoyable, interesting and fun pirate adventure with lots of good humor, great scenery, solid script supported by excellent acting all around.WARNING :ONLY for older kids and possibly teenagers and not too squeamish adults.  The ""Living Dead"" pirates (shown 2/3's of the way through the film) can bother more sensitive viewers!!With that said, my young son - the pirate lover -  was able to differentiate between the story's realism and the ""Living Dead"" make believe - but, his older sister was not able to.Review:Fun movie with a great script, great filming, great editing, great special effects, great story, great acting, good humor, great scenery, lot's great story evolution, of fun. (this review is just too easy).But, too scary for some people and not appropriate for the very young.  I really wish this had not been so well pursued, because I think this would otherwise be a fun movie for my young son.Story:Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is an affected pirate Captain in port in search of a ship in the 18th century Caribbean who finds the ""leverage"" (blacksmith and expert swordsman Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom) to re-acquire ""his"" ""Black Pearl"" ship that was taken from him by his mutinous crew and the infamous Captain Barbossa (expertly played by Geoffrey Rush).  Sparrow and Turner's adventure is propelled forward by Turner's love for Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley - in a very talented role as the Governor's daughter) who has been kidnaped by Captain Barbossa by mistake in her identity.DVD's Extra'sCommentary is good, not great.  I wished for more.  Other DVD extra's are plentiful and excellent:  like making of the film, deleted scenes, etc. and well worth the time and investment for the DVD."	4.0	A Fun Pirate and Ghost Adventure	2005-05-23	0	0	0

Special mention for Geoffrey Rush who does his finest Worzel Gummidge impression as Captain Barbosa!

Anyways....WOW when I saw this in theaters, I could not believe how much I loved this movie!!!  And all day on December 1st, I was just beside myself with anticipation over the fact that at midnight, I would be able to go get my copy of the DVD (our WalMart is 24 hours)!!!!  And that's exactly what we did, and I stayed up until 3:30 am watching it.  I watched it again the next day with my children, who also love this movie.  I tell you, I cannot get enough of this movie, and I hope the sequel is just as good, although since Johnny Depp's in that one too, I don't see how it can possibly be bad!!!  I can't say enough good about this movie, and I probably watch it more than any other DVD in my collection (and my collection is quite large)!  If any of you out there have not seen this wonderful wonderful movie yet, then you have absolutely no excuse not to at least rent it.  shame on you.  But my guess is that there aren't many of you out there.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1GDQ2QVPW8DBR	dreadful light	"'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' had the potential to be very, very good, or very, very bad. Movies based on theme park rides seem like a flimsy idea at best (despite how much fun the actual ride itself is), but Director Gore Verbinski managed to create an action-filled pirate extravaganza, full of great atmosphere, and reminiscent of the ride--just not in a hokey sort of way.Blacksmith Will Turner (played by the very divine Orlando Bloom) enlists the help of pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in order to rescue his love, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) from the cursed crew of the Black Pearl. A seemingly straightforward plot, until the two discover that Captain Barboosa accidentally kidnapped the wrong person, and it is actually Will's blood that the pirates need to reverse the curse. Oh, and did I mention that Jack seems not to have Will's best interest in mind, either?Johnny Depp turns what could have been just an average action movie into a high-spirited good one. I've always felt that Depp is a better actor when playing slightly-off characters, and his flamboyant Captain Jack Sparrow is just another example of this. Orlando Bloom is perfect as earnest, straight-and-narrow Will Turner, and Keira Knightly gives the role of Elizabeth Swan a much needed zing.Go see this movie, if only to watch Johnny Depp sashaying drunkenly, yet oddly majestically, through beautiful nautical sets that makes even the most reticient of us want to say, ""arrgghh."""	4.0	Fun Summer Movie	2003-07-16	4	4	0

Surine ""Stanley"""	"Please note, this review is for the contents of the blu ray edition, not the movie itself.Many movies transferred to blu ray will have a very similar quality to the DVD version.  I've even seen some movies that appear to be worse on blu ray then their DVD counterpart.  This blu ray is of AMAZING quality.  To compare, I used the scene of Jack and Elizabeth stranded on the island (the famous ""Why is the rum gone?"" scene).  I never realized how fuzzy the picture in the DVD was.  The sand, waters, and detail of the clothing is all muddled.  The sound is decent, but compressed.  On the blu ray version, the sand is crisp, the waves of the waters are very detailed, you can even see the individual strands of hair on Jack's beard.  The sound is powerful and the bass sounds of the explosions comes through crystal clear.The special features include everything that you got with the DVD version as well as a ""Scoundrels at sea"" feature that plays during the movie.  Turn on this feature and the pop ups appear during the film and you can select these pop ups for additional informational movies.  The main menu has also been changed from the medallion theme to a talking skull.  The skull is pretty cool looking, but can be annoying since you will make your selection, and he still wants to talk to you.Bottom line, even if you have the DVD version of this movie, this is one that's worth the upgrade.

Johnny Depp, in particular, gives a great performance that won my admiration and respect.  On the other hand, I think Orlando Bloom did a less than adequate job and I ended up not being able to relate to his character very much, which is rather unfortunate, but this only detracts from the enjoyment of the movie slightly. I've seen enough Disney movies to know that they're capable of glossing over some major flaws and turning a pretty crappy idea into a watchable movie, but this movie is flawless.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; may be the start of a new movie trend: Cheesy movies based on amusement park rides (as opposed to cheesy movies based on comics, books, or other movies). Cheesy and more than a  dumb at times, it nevertheless might the most amusing major movie released so far this summer.The notorious pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives in a British colony in the Caribbean, and is apprehended by the local militia after rescuing the governer's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) from drowning. He escapes, has a run-in with a brash young blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) named Will Turner, and is imprisoned, to be hung at dawn for piracy.But things don't quite work out that way: a golden pirate medallion that Elizabeth once took from Will sends out a siren call to the Black Pearl, a legendary pirate ship. The crew ransacks the town and captures Elizabeth, then leaves. Will is determined to save her -- so determined that he breaks Jack out of prison and helps him &quot;commandeer&quot; one of the Navy's ships. They learn that a curse is holding the crew of the Black Pearl in a perpetual state of rotted undeath... and that both Will and Jack have mysteries in their pasts that bind them to the Pearl's fate.If &quot;Pirates&quot; had taken itself seriously, this movie would have been a complete disaster. I mean, a cursed treasure, zombie pirates, blood sacrifices and a big looming dark ship with tattered sails -- it's the stuff of parody, and well does Verbenski know it. So he intersperses the serious stuff with plenty of comedy -- some in the script (&quot;We named the monkey Jack&quot; and Will's overenthusiastic &quot;Avast!&quot;) and some physical (the walking rowboat and several people getting hit on the head). Even the battle scenes are leavened with humor, such as a pirate chasing his fake eye across a deck as everyone else fights.The action scenes are pretty tight, especially the ship-to-ship fights. The script is spotty in places -- Will has some some real groaners (&quot;We must save her!&quot;) and in times it runs ashore into patches of monotony (the rum scene). And the CGI is, for the most part, good. Most of the shots of skeletons (walking, drinking, attacking Naval officers) are convincing, but the sight of them scurrying up a ship's side is pretty fake-looking.Johnny Depp expertly plays Jack Sparrow as a very offbeat pirate from his first scene onward. His slip-away movements, weird walk and ingratiating gold-flecked smile make him look slightly drunk, but he snaps into razor-sharpness once he has to. Orlando Bloom is excellent as naive blacksmith Will Turner, a simple guy with a thing for Elizabeth and a deep dislike of pirates. Knightley is both strong and vulnerable as the not-so-helpless Elizabeth, and Geoffrey Rush sneers and snarls as Captain Barbarossa.&quot;Pirates&quot; is hard-to-classify brain candy, with some action, romance, horror and comedy. A movie that could have been a complete disaster. It's not perfect, and if you go in with any expectations of brilliance you'll be disapppointed. But the end result is: &quot;Yo ho ho, a pirate's life for me...&quot;	4.0	&quot;Bloody pirates!&quot;	2003-07-13	29	20	9

This is a great popcorn flick that has really put the Swash back into BucklingThis action/ adventure/comedy is loosely based on the ride at Disneyland. Although the similarities are somewhat few and far between this is probably a good thing as it escapes the Disney marketing attempt feel.The extremely well chosen cast could never be better with Johnny Depp brilliantly playing the light-hearted mostly-drunk pirate Jack Sparrow (sorry Captain Jack Sparrow). He provides most of the comedy in his one-liners, lucky escapes and defiant bragging. The romance is between the kidnapped Governors daughter Elizabeth Swann, (Kiera Knightly) and Will Turner (played wonderfully by man-of-the-moment Orlando Bloom) who comes to her rescue. The typical cursed pirate, Captain Barbossa of the titular `Black Pearl'  (played by Geoffery Rush) is the all round bad guy shouting traditional pirate phrases.The CG (done by Industrial Light and Magic) is literally ground breaking with cursed pirates turning from skeletal to flesh as they battle in and out of moonlight. This gives both an eerie and astonishing effect.To round off there are action scenes galore with numerous sword fights and canon fire which are amazing and really keep the film up to speed.THE EXTRASNo DVD is complete nowadays without extras. With a full extra disc there is quite a lot to keep one amused for hours. There are three commentaries, which really depend on what you want to get out of a commentary the first is with Gore Verbinski (director) and Johnny Depp, which is surprisingly quite dull mainly thanking various people for hard work. If you are looking for trivia then the partial commentary with Jerry Bruckheimer (producer) or commentary with scriptwriters is for you, but the one I found the best is the commentary with actors Kiera Knightly and Jack Davenport (who plays Commodore Norrington) This commentary is also partial but is the funniest. The partial commentary is something I have never come across before but is quite an advantage, as you don't have to watch the whole film again and listen to people drone on about scenes that weren't really important to them.The downfall I felt to this DVD is the interactive menus which if you just want to get the film to play means time is lost waiting for menus to load.Back to positive and the second disc holds loads of good stuff. The first I checked out was the blooper real with the actors messing up, which you don't quite often get to see. The bad thing about this is that it was only 3mins. There are 19 deleted scenes, which I didn't really feel were very interesting so it just as well they stayed deleted.There are many different featurettes on this disc. The ones I'm liking the most is the Epic at Sea, Diary of a Pirate and Fly on the set which are all on the set interviewing actors etc.  which prove very interesting and in depth. There is also ""Walt Disney Wonderful World of Color"" which shows a bit about the ride for all who haven't been on it.The last line is I think this is a wonderful movie and the DVD really compliments it well."	5.0	Blockbuster of the Summer DVD of the Winter	2003-12-04	1	1	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AKZMP6OOE89GV	Elite14	I know most critics and fans love this movie. I enjoyed it myself, but I didn't think it was as good as most people have told me it is. Maybe it's because of my hatred of Disney for screwing up Pearl Harbor. I have never really liked Disney live-action movies. I am a huge fan of Beauty &amp; The Beast, Little Mermaid, Lion King, etc. I just can't think of one Disney film that I have liked that has NOT been animated. Now, I know that Armageddon &amp; Pearl Harbor were produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, but Disney was pulling the strings. I liked Armageddon quite a bit. I would rather be thrown into a pool of acid than watch Pearl Harbor again. But, those were not looked at as 'Disney' movies. This one is, however.The plot is realtively simple......a pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) loses his ship, The Black Pearl,  when he is overthrown by his mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and he is left for dead on an island. Later he ends up in Port Royal when it happens to be attacked by Barbossa using the Black Pearl. Along the way, Jack meets a blacksmith named Will (Orlando Bloom) who also happens to be quite gifted with a blade. He is in love with the Govenor's daughter, Elizabeth (the HOT Keira Knightly), and wants to marry her. Barbossa's goons then kidnap Elizabeth and a quest is on. Jack Sparrow wants his ship back and Will is coming along to rescue Elizabeth.It's not a deep story, but it's well done. Johnny Depp steals the movie. His portrayl of Jack Sparrow is amazing. He acts like he is drunk the whole film, and has all the good lines. His presence on-screen is obvious and he is one of my two favorite actors (Edward Norton being the other). I haven't seen Keira Knightly in anything before this movie, but I certainly hope I see more of her. Yes she is unbelivably hot, but she is a pretty good actress too. While her performance here is not oscar-worthy, it hopefully will lead to more dramatic roles. Orlando Bloom does NOT shoot one arrow this whole flick. Now that I got that out of the way, he plays off Depp perfectly. He is the nice, heroic figure that this kind of film needs. He doesn't get the humorous lines that Depp or Rush receive, but he holds his own. Geoffrey Rush looks like he is having a blast with this role. While being a villian, he never really becomes hateable. He has that 'Disney-like' villian quality, but adding his own twist. Don't go expecting Dustin Hoffman from Hook. Which is a good thing.This is also the first film I have seen that Gore Verbinski has directed. I must say, it's refreshing to see a Bruckhemier film that is not directed by Michael Bay. That is not a knock on Bay, it's just that you don't need a severe case of ADD to watch this movie. Verbinski doesn't really do anything that stands out, in my mind, but he takes what could have been a HUGE flop and made is a HUGE summer hit.A sequal is already being discussed. All summer I had to hear about this movie, and now I know why. It's a good movie, but it's not the best of the summer. X-Men 2 &amp; Termintor 3 were much better 'summer blockbuster' films, in my opinion. I thought this flick would suck, but it actually ended up surprising me. I would definately recommend checking it out.This DVD is loaded with special features. I won't go into all of them, since you can just scroll up and look at it. Here is an overall look though....deleted scenes, blooper reel, commentaries, documantaries, featurettes, trailers and more. If you take away 'The Two Towers' extended edition DVD, this is the most packed one of the year.	3.0	A movie that was a bit overrated........	2004-01-18	4	1	3

I was really intrigued by the ads, and Orlando Bloom is hot! This movie was soooo much more than i expected. The acting was awesome, and even though you actually have to think to understand the plot, it is incredibly developed. The movie may have been long, but it draws you so deeply into its world that you barely even notice it. And although the fight scenes are a little lengthy, they're not superflous like in some other movies: there is a clear-cut reason each battle is fought, and it actually advances the plot. Johnny Depp brings the comedy, Orlando Bloom brings the romance and the action, and the end result was a truly incredible film.	5.0	THE BEST MOVIE	2003-07-11	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3O1AZ5AQB8WPD	Emma	"There's not that much to say about this film accept for its pretty darn good. The plot's as silly and nonsensical as they come, there's no blood and gore (its Disney after all) but its still a proper sweeping, swashbuckling rollercoaster, with appropriate roushing score, well placed CGI and good acting.Oralndo Bloom (as blacksmith Will Turner) and Keira Knightley (playing Jonathan Pryce's daughter Elizabeth Swan) are well played, as are the lesser characters (such as Geoffrey Rush as a wickedly hammed up evil pirate Captain Barbossa and Jack Davenport as the wrong guy for the heroine).But as I'm sure you've grasped Jonny Depp is pretty special. Previously I had only seen Depp in a handfull of films, including the abismal Sleepy Hollow, Blow and From Hell. He was never on my ""stand out"" actor list - not bad, just not that good. Boy did I get a wake up call. Here playing the swaying, camp, intellegent-but-bizarre Captain Jack Sparrow, Depp carries the film. His character gets all the jokes and gestures but they are made ten times more funny and relevant by his delivery. His slurring British accent barely falters and Captain Jack really comes across as a rock and roll star of the Caribbean Seas (its wishful thanking but in terms of acting quality-not character quality, Sparrow is hardly realistic-Depp deserves an Oscar-if there's any merit left in the award).Yes, you know how the love triangle is going to work out, that there will be a happy ending and all will turn up Disney but I deny anyone who's seen this film to tell me they didn't enjoy it. Pirates' is genuinely funny and well paced and unlike so many of this years blockbusters (Hulk, T3 etc...) the film is not built around Special Effects (computer imagery is sensibly used). See the film, you know you want to. And then you'll want to see it again."	5.0	"""and really bad eggs""........""a pirates life for me!"""	2003-08-26	8	5	3

However, this series has exceeded all expectations. It's a funny, swashbuckling adventure.  The plot is basically an excuse to give the pirates as much screentime as possible, but it works well enough and has enough suspense to keep viewers entertained.  Johnny Depp really carries the movies as Captain Jack Sparrow, the witty, amoral pirate captain. Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly are also good, and the supporting actors (including the monkey) have some funny scenes. This movie is easily the best of the three.

In slight contradiction to the other reviewers here, Mr. Depp did not merely act his role extremely well, he completely submersed his personality into Capt'n Jack Sparrow and made him come alive as a real person.  When I looked at the screen I did not think that Johnny Depp makes a great pirate, I thought, ""Now HE'S a pirate I can like!  Wish there had been some like him back then."" [Edward England came close, but his career as a pirate came to an abrupt end when his crew marooned him for being too lenient to captives.]  To borrow words from Harrison Ford, ""I thought the POINT of acting was that you looked at the screen and thought --now THAT'S a [pirate]!""  Mr. Depp succeeds in this.As to the rather churlish comments of one picayune person who thought it was stupid for the English to keep fighting foes they couldn't kill -- it's called SELF-DEFENSE!  The undead pirates were attacking them and fighting back was better than, ""We can't kill them so we'll lie down and die....""Finally, a note for everyone who wondered about Sparrow's eye-liner and/or suggested sexual ambiguity:  Sailors, especially ones who had sailed in the vicinity of the East India Company(origin of Sparrow's pirate brand) and thus areas where use of kohl was common, used said kohl to cut the glare of the sun reflecting off the ocean.  Much like football players use that black stuff under their eyes, but are in no way sexually ambiguous.Drink up me 'earties, YO HO!!!!"	5.0	More effusive praise & a few asides.	2003-09-23	3	3	0

If you have seen Treasure Island or any other pirate-themed film, you have seen Pirates of the Caribbean.  The special effects are hokey and unbelievable, the plot is thin and disjointed.  A full 45-minutes could have easily been cut from this film, which would only have made the tortured plot more quickly and mercifully forgetten.The only gem in this mess if Johnny Depp.  He has to have been the best actor to be Oscar nominated for the worst film.  He is his normal witty, charming persona, and he is clearly having fun making the best of a bad situation.  I would not have watched this film to the end if it weren't for him.  He turns in one of his best performances in a career of outstanding roles.Whether Johnny Depp is enough to save this film is up to you.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3L2U581LL17EB	Eric	I saw the movie in the hoopla of all the hype, when most people I knew were proclaiming this one of the summer's best films. Not unexpectedly, I walked into this one with high expectations, hoping for perhaps another Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or even The Mummy (I'd never seen the other Indy flicks in theaters). Walking out of the theater a very long two-and-a-half hours later (actually, more like 2 hours 50 minutes, given the previews and the final scene after the credits) (this movie has way too many double crosses and false climaxes), I'm not even sure if this is better than The Mummy Returns.Based off an amusement park theme ride, a lack of solid plot isn't a surprise. Orlando Bloom stars as Will Turner, a dashing blacksmith who's in madly in love with the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, a Natalie Portman look-a-like, except she's much prettier and appears to be a better actress). But when she's kidnapped by a group of ghostly pirates (led by Geoffrey Rush), Turner enlists the help of pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who appears a few cards short of a complete deck. Dark secrets are unearthed and it is revealed the undead pirates need to make a blood sacrifice to become human again.It's not that Pirates' premise doesn't hold any potential, the movie does, after all, give us the prospect of an oceanbound adventure, the kind of movies you don't see too often. But Indiana Jones on water, this is not, for it lacks all of that trilogy's infectious sense of fun and thrilling ventures into the unknown (not to mention the smart dialogue and rousing John Williams' score). If not for Johnny Depp's performance and Keira Knightley's beauty and strong screen presence, Pirates might very well have lulled me into sleep.The movie's biggest problem is its generic action sequences. Most of the swordfights are routine, directed without much flair or energy, and their bloodless presentation is just too juvenile-oriented for me. In fact, they all start to look the same after a while, so a little variety would have been appreciated. The film's one semi-creative fight, between Turner and Sparrow, is ineffective since you realize neither are in danger, and the climactic battle, pitting dozens of the undead pirates against the living, doesn't work since the fighting is done by characters I didn't give a damn about.I like the actual concept of fighting undead pirates, but most of the villains are so goofy (especially the one keeps that fake eye), it's hard to see them as an actual menace. And when they are played for laughs, they're not very funny, either (how many times can we see an eye pop out before it stops being funny?). Also, making them former mates of Sparrow's sort of demystifies them (as if their goofy behavior didn't do so already).  Because Sparrow knows all the men, it makes their backstories less intriguing and mysterious.As a pure adventure, Pirates is fraught with a lot of problems. It's repetitive, the characters keep going back and forth between the same islands and boats, sneaking in and out. The most successful adventures usually get the charaters going from A to B to C, rather than A to C, then B, and then back to C, then B, and then back to C (and in this case, even back to A!). I got sick of seeing that island cavern over and over in ten minutes.But Pirates is not without merit. Its singular savior is Johnny Depp, whose introductory scene is so hilarious, I was afraid I'd choke on my laughter. Sure, some of his scenes don't work so well (like when he tries to get those two guards to distract themselves), but he's more often a blast to watch than not, and most of the scenes he's in are pretty enjoyable. I also liked Keira Knightley (almost easily the movie's best piece of eye candy when you compare her good looks with some of the goofy visual effects), who displays genuine fire and feistiness even when she's mostly played as a damsel in distress. Both performers make the best of their parts, elevating the material quite significantly (if Depp and Knightley weren't present, the movie would have gone from middling to bad in a heartbeat).Klaus Badelt's score sounds almost exactly like Hans Zimmer's work in The Rock given a period flavor. It's distracting, I spent too much time wondering in what ways Badelt would rip-off scores from Jerry Bruckheimer films.

I know, I know....I am just now watching this movie for the first time.  I have to be honest, i thought this movie would be a bit childish, what with the Disney name on it and all that goes along with that.  I picked up the DVD because my kids wanted to see it and i was truely amazed at how great this movie was.  I thought i would see cheesy pirates and tinkerbell somewhere in the mix but WOW, i loved this film.  I think this may have become my favorite movie.If you love drama, action, adventure or love stories then you will enjoy this book. Johnny Depp plays an awesome character, and Keira Knightley is simply gorgeous.  The ghost/cursed scenes weren't even clost to cheesy, i love the way they pulled this off.If you have not seen this movie, check it out.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	"There's a reason why the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films are so popular . . . the action and adventures are endless! It's not just the unforgettable cast (Depp and Rush definitely steal the show as Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa), it's also the kick@$$ action sequences. The many battles in the Caribbean get the good ol' adrenaline pumping when they occur on screen. The music makes it even better: although I'm not a big fan of Hanz Zimmer, he really does know how to make some suspenseful Hollywood music. Humor has a wide range here: it's a Disney film, so there's bound to be comedic sidekicks and silly slapstick. I don't really care much for Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley, but they do add some nice touches.This isn't for those who are in search of political or social implications. This is a high-octane action-adventure film that I'm sure a majority of the inhabitants on this planet enjoy watching.Grade: A"	5.0	The beginning of an action-packed series	2009-04-07	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1VK1A6AXC3MIC	Erin Marisa	This movie was amazing. I saw it yesterday, and i was blown away. It was absolutly well put together. The dead pirates were sooo cool looking. They looked real.Now, before I went to see the movie, I asked my bestest friend in the whole world if she wanted to come. She declined my offer. Too bad. She missed a great movie.The plot was perfectly interwoven with twists and turns. Especially Jack Sparrow played by Jonny Depp. He was cunningly perfect. Jonny Depp is undenilable handsome, but put him in a pirate outfit, and watch out. He is a half drunk, pirate hottie. Depp is a good actor, as we know by Chocolat. But with POTC, he has transformed him self into a great actor. This could be the turning point for him.Orlando Bloom. I could talk about him all day. As Willam Turner, he portrays a pirate's son. Although he doesn't find that out until in the movie. It is a break from Lord of the Rings. He has a bit more freedom. Plus, he doesn't have to wear a long white wig and try to sword fight. And of course, he's definitly hot...In a movie such as this, you need the damsel in distress. Keira Knightly. She was brillant in Bend It Like Beckham. And was even more stunning here. She plays Elizabeth Swann, the governers daughter. And she is brillant at it. She is not the damsel in distress, well, not all the time anyway.Considering that fact that this movie is based on the ride in Disney Land/World (not sure which one), the movie was really good. No, better than good. Excellent. Superb.But before the movie, they showed a trailer for Hauted Mansion (another movie based on ride). It might be a good movie without Eddie Murphy. He just seems to think that this will be a comedy. But it looks like a horror movie. And I want to see it! The set looked amazing for this movie.Overall, go see this movie. Take the kids. Take the whole family. And the best part is, not Disney logo with the castle at the beggining.	5.0	The best movie of the year!	2003-08-08	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2YEEPV81E73PX	"""erinsp"""	When I first saw the commercials for this movie, I just laughed. My first instinct was to think that Disney had become truly desperate if they were resorting to making a movie about one of their rides. Then one of my friends said she wanted me to go with her to see the movie because she felt stupid going to see it alone. I only gave in when she offered to pay my way (not that it's much, but come on, free popcorn and drinks!) and I sat down to get ready for a long bore. Well, the movie certainly is long, but not boring in the least. The beginning set a creepy tone to get us in the right mood, then once we saw Jack we had the perfect set-up: action, drama, humor, and a love story that was unfortunately a little too far pushed to the back burner.The only movie I'd ever seen Johnny Depp in before was Sleepy Hollow, so I wouldn't have recognized him if it wasn't for the fact that the commercials told me who he was. The fact that he could play a virtually always-drunk pirate so well cracked me up. I will never forget &quot;But why is the rum gone?&quot; That's the first quote from the movie that pops out of my mouth every time. Basically, I loved his entire performance, I just wish there was a little less eyeliner on the poor man. Then we have Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, who make a dream couple not only in looks, but also in their roles as a governor's daughter and a blacksmith. The rich and the poor, it's always the ultimate love story. Sure, Will Turner is a slightly stiff character, but he loosened up considerably by the end. Then Geoffrey Rush, I'm not sure anything I say could do him justice. Right along with Johnny Depp, he was the most perfect for his character.Now we throw in the incredible special effects, fight scenes, and plot, and we have one of the best films of the year. The only thing I have to add is that I felt a little bad for Norrington by the end of the film. The poor guy needs a girl that likes him, he deserves it. Jack Davenport did a wonderful job with him.	5.0	Certainly wasn't expecting it	2004-01-02	1	1	0

(No Spoilers Included)The open-ended one sentence summary: Some cursed pirates kidnap Miss Swann, and her would-be lover teams up with a cool pirate to rescue her. Following so far?Content Inappropriate for All Ages: Some pirate-like bad language, creepy zombie-things, blood, a few indirect references to prostitutes, (hey, they're PIRATES!), lots of drinking, violence of many kinds, and explosions.Characters: 4 of 5 stars. Very likeable characters. As I'm sure everybody knows, Johnny Depp is a standout. Everbody else conveys their characters well (One of the better Keira Knightley movies). I have heard it said that the movie lacks romantic spark, and I agree that it could use a little more heat, but all in all, it's good. (They just kind of stumble around each other)Plot: 3 of 5 stars. It's just a little too thick in here sometimes, but you can tell that they tried really hard. It's just pretty involved and kind of hectic. If you think too hard, you might frustrate yourself. Weaving in and out of this ""oh boy"" plot are brillant lines and classic scenes. (Jack Sparrow is a riot!)Cinematography: 4 of 5 stars. First of all, the staging is very good, and the choregraphy is very nice also. Second, MOST of the special effects are believeable, except there's one or two little parts that wreck it for me every time. Locations and sets: superb.Music: 5 of 5 stars. Hans Zimmer does the usual great job and provides a swashbuckling score with a memorable and popular theme. The ""scary music"" really heightens the scary parts.Impact: 3 of 5 stars. After all that praise, why the low rating? Though the movie is quotable and charismatic, nice to look at and funny, I sincerely believe that it is 20 minutes overlong. I ALWAYS lose interest in the last half hour, I'm just pushed to the limits of my attention. If not for that critical flaw, I'd like this movie alot more.All in all, 3 of 5 stars."	3.0	Review: Pirates of the Caribbean - Curse of the Black Pearl	2006-07-07	11	5	6

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3T7G9RD6LNB96	E. T. Young	I admit, I was intensely skeptical about this summer's crop of movies, particularly following the Matrix fiasco, and I probably would not have gone to see Pirates had it not been for friends informing it was worth the current outrageous ticket prices.Am I ever glad I listened to them.Plot-wise, the movie isn't anything jaw-droppingly amazing, but it's strong enough to allow the other elements of the movie to soar. And soar they do! The cast is spectacular, the computer graphics are great, the sets and costumes work perfectly. There was obviously a great attention to detail: towards the beginning, when Knightley's character pulls the pirate medallion out of the desk, there's a faded imprint of the medallion, a touch of pure genius as far as sets are concerned, and there are dozens of other such details throughout the movie.The cg pirates are suitably convincing. Though there are one or two times the cg is noticeable, it was otherwise seamless. No small feat, given the magnitude of the cg involved.And, of course, the actors. It's been said a million times by now, but I'll say it again: Depp's performance absolutely stole the show. This could have been a serious problem, since it could have overwhelmed the other characters, but Bloom, Rush, Knightley, and others also gave strong performances and created an overall balance. The other characters are a bit forgettable compared to Jack Sparrow, but they're not totally lost thanks to the cast's considerable acumen.Lastly, a large nod to Gore Verbinski. He's an incredibly versatile director with mastery of a number of genres. I can't wait to see what he'll direct next.If you've been having any doubts about going to see Pirates, erase them and head to the theatres now. It's an intensely enjoyable film, and one I'll be adding to my DVD collection and enjoying for years to come.	5.0	Spectacular Summer Flick	2003-07-20	2	2	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2BKLS4NIYL1PP	E. Van Dyke	I am a huge Johnny Depp fan.  He is great in every movie he's in, even if the movie itself is not that good.  He's great in this movie as well and it is good.  The plot may be fairly thin (was it really a shock to find out that Barbossa was the traitorous first mate?) but this is an action/adventure movie, not a drama, so the hell with the plot.  Geoffrey Rush shows why he has an Oscar.  The man can play a great villain.  Orlando Bloom is beginning to show signs of typecasting (although he's not an elf in this movie, he is an action-oriented character like Legolas) but he's a decent action star, so maybe he should run with that.  Certainly is a better actor then that lump of uncharasmatic mud, Vin Diesel.  Jonathan Pryce is one of my favorite character actors and he is great in this film as well.  My only complaint is the talentless Keira Knightley.  Her only claim to fame was looking enough like Natalie Portman to be cast as her double in Star Wars Episode I.  Why the filmmakers decided that her limited screen time in that movie deserved to be turned into an extensive film career I have NO idea.  I was hoping her character would die during the movie to nix any chance of her appearing in a sequel, but alas, it was not to be.  Is it just me or does the up and coming crop of actors and actresses look just absolutely pathetic?  We went from Charlie Chaplin, to Orson Welles, to Marlon Brando, to Jack Nicholson, to Harrison Ford, to Johnny Depp, to......Ashton Kutcher.

When my sister dragged me along to the cinema, I was steeling myself for two hours of absolute hell!Now, I consider myself as having a relatively wide taste in movies (music as well), but one thing I couldn't stand before this was pirate movies, mainly because there's been a larger ratio of crap pirate movies to good pirate movies compared to other genres. I was expecting to have to sit through two hours of shabby plot, cheap sets and american actors doing crap British accents (being a Brit myself this REALLY grates).But I was shocked. The first scene was, to be honest, pretty unpromising because it contained all the worst actors (Jack Davenport and young Elizabeth), but as the movie started to get on I began to like it more and more. By the time it had got to the pirates marching underwater I was loving every bit of it. The acting was (with two exceptions) superb, the plotting very well done, the action secenes stunning and the whole film generally brilliant.The highlight, as I guess you're probably sick of hearing by now, was Johnny Depp's fantastic Jack Sparrow. Close second was Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. They were both absolutely fantastic, ironic seeing as it was the non-British actors I was dreading the most.Even more ironic was the fact that by far the worst actor was one of the British ones. Orlando Bloom was, to be honest, awful. Wooden, dull and distinctly unlikeable, he is the one reason that this film has recieved four stars rather than five.Apart from that, absolutely fantastic.	4.0	Surprise, surprise!	2003-12-17	2	2	0

The sword play action was exciting, the special effects of the skeleton pirates were impressive, and Johnny Depp was fantastic as captain Jack Sparrow.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AYWAY5MKLAITN	Film Noir Fedora	Firstly, lets bare in mind that there hasn't been a good pirate movie in a while. And that's just too long to go without one. Pirates Of The Carribean: The curse of the black pearl all starts out with a legend. A legend of cursed aztec gold. Anyone who touches or steals it is cursed to live the rest of his/her days as a walking bag of bones, unable to enjoy drinks, food, or touch. A lost boy on a wrecked ship holds the gold around his neck. A young girl retrieves it and holds on to it while they both grow up. After seeing what their grown up selves look like, we get a taste of the sea air and . . .in sails Captain Jack Sparrow. The real Hero of the story, in my opnion.From the moment we meet him, we are already curious and slowly dipping into giddy excitement as he says his first lines and sounds remarkably like a drunken pirate who really leaves his mark.He takes on the kind of personality of Buggs Bunny/Groucho Marx/Keith richards persona. But, like all pirates, he's always looking for a way out, a way in, or just a way to a good angle.Throughout the adventures of Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Jack, we are steady as she goes and just begging for more and more and get delivered more and more excitement followed by endless laughs.The jokes are well-executed, the special effects are good and not overally done, the plot is solid, the amount of settings is vast and beautiful, and the choreography of the sword fights is amazing.All the way you'll be rooting for Captain Jack Sparrow and glued to your seat with rambunctious delight.You'll love it. A sure-fire winner. Believe me, people, there was a reason why this little beauty of a movie racked in 600 million dollars worldwide.Hope you have a good time watching the movie, mates. Don't forget your rum. Arrrgggghhh.The dvd features a mammoth size of special features showing documenteries as wells as visual and conceptual desgins, followed by three audio comentaries.

Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best Disney movies to come out in recent years. Like many of you, watching this movie reminded me of going on the theme ride at Disneyland.This movie is fun enough for everyone. The plot, while not deeply complex, is good enough to keep the adults satisfied. The younger audience who sees the movie will love fighting and battle scenes between the pirates and skeletons. While there is some action adventure violence, it is nothing that the usual PG 13 movie will have.Johnny Depp does a commendable job as Captain Jack Sparrow, using his wit and cleverness to gain the confidence of the governor's daughter. Together they, along with another, played by Orlando Bloom, go on a mission to try to take over The Black Pearl.The disc set has many extras as well. Behind the scene footage along with other nifty pieces of info make this a good buy if you like a good pirate adventure tale.	4.0	Swashbuckling Disney	2005-06-04	1	0	1

Johnny Depp's pirate outfit looked ridculous and I just don't care for pirate movies.  Boy, was I wrong.  Two of my kids wanted to go so I went along.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.  Johnny Depp was pure genius (I have always appreciated his talent) and played Jack Sparrow with so many nuances that it kept you guessing as to his true character.  The plot moved along quickly with many twists and turns and the scenery and actors were a treat to behold!  The whole theater was laughing and enjoying the movie along with us.  It's about time we got our [moneys] worth at the theater and I honestly say I would pay it again, which I never do (view a movie twice).  I recommend it to everyone, even those who think they don't like pirate movies.  Awesome until the end. (PS: Kids 13 and 9 enjoyed it immensely)	5.0	Pirates of the Carribean an extremely pleasant surprise!	2003-08-08	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1FD8LITJZE48V	"Frank Ponce ""Movie Mavin"""	&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; was one of the most celebrated films of 2003. It was a huge blockbuster and rised everybody's expectations due to the fun-filled adventure, swash-buckling action and the amazing peformance by Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp is unbelievable and funny as well. His humor and his drunken-like swagger gives the audience a sense of fun.&quot;Pirates&quot;, based on the Disney attraction, is fun throughout. There's great production values, special effects and exciting characters. To be honest, when I saw the film the first day it came out, I didn't have high hopes for it. But I was surprised what a grand spectacle &quot;Pirates&quot; was. I enjoyed it so much I saw it again the next day.But Depp was 50% percent of the film's success. His performance was so enjoyable, I wasn't surprised he got nominated for an Oscar. The cast is fine as well. Kiera Knightly as Elizabeth is a rising star, and Orlando Bloom is sure to be a leading man in movies some day.The thing that stopped me from giving &quot;Pirates&quot; 5 stars, was the length of running time. It was a half an hour too long. But no need to be nick picky, &quot;Pirates&quot; is sure to be one of the most talked about films of the decade. The DVD is pretty nice as well.	4.0	Yo ho ho ho!

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3BTL4FV6ODKAT	"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain..."	This has to be the stupidest idea for movie in all of history.  A movie based on an amusement park ride?  A pirate movie?  A cursed pirate movie?  A cursed undead pirate movie?  This couldn't have worked.  This SHOULDN'T have worked!  But somehow, it did.Start with the cast.  Johnny Depp flat out steals the movie with a Captain Jack Sparrow that is partly Keith Richards and partly Pepe Le Pew, but Geoffrey Rush gives him quite a run for his treasure as the evil incarnate, Captain Barbossa.  Orlando Bloom as the earnestly heroic Will Turner and Keira Knightly as the spunky Elizabeth Swann round out the four great stars, but even the supporting cast members give memorable performances.  Jonathan Pryce is amazing as the cowardly, weaselly Governor Swann, and Jack Davenport is the very model of terminal stiff upper lip disease as the ramrod Lieutenant/Commodore Norrington.  Kevin McNally gives a fine turn as Mr. Gibbs.  There are also a couple of classic comic pairings: pirates Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook) and soldiers (marines?) Murtogg and Mullroy (Giles New and Angus Barnett).If you listen to the screenwriters' commentary track, you'll be even more amazed because beyond the basic concept of cursed undead pirates returning treasure rather than stealing it, everything else about the plot was constantly in flux.  So why does it work?  Well, beyond great performances, the key is the proper balance of drama and humor.  Like costumed superheroes before them it was almost impossible to imagine anyone doing pirates well; there had been too many embarrassing failures swinging wildly between camp and straight (Roman Polanski'sPiratesand Renny Harlin'sCutthroat Islandcome to mind).  POTC works because although the characters often say funny things and do funny things, they are deadly serious all the while: Sparrow is ever after his ship; Elizabeth is trying to save Will; Will is trying to save Elizabeth; the cursed pirates are trying to lift the curse; and Norrington is trying to lift the pirates... onto a gallows.  All these conflicting interests guarantee plenty of sparks.  The fact that the special effects are downright stunning doesn't hurt.The question that cannot be answered yet is whether the creators understand why it worked.  With two back-to-back sequels in the works will this be anotherBack to the Future, with two marvelous sequels or anotherThe Matrix, with two terrible sequels that leave you convinced the first movie was just a fluke?  We'll know soon.Note: your choice betweenPirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)orPirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl (Three-Disc Special Edition)depends on how much you like this movie and how much you like behind the scenes featurettes.  The most significant disk 3 feature is probably the history of the ride documentary that was previously available only as a PC computer feature.  The rest are interesting but not something you are likely to watch more than once.	5.0	Worst Idea for a Movie Ever	2005-12-22	3	3	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1WU8KTQIXA1U8	"""funky511"""	"Bursting with wit and constantly poking fun at itself, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is the surprise hit of the summer!!! The cast is to die for.The plot concerns a bunch of cursed pirates led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) who are looking to undo their curse, which has made them undead, and therefor unable to enjoy food, water, or anything to do with the senses. To undo the curse, they believe they have to capture the governer's daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) and use her special possesion of an ancient peice of gold she recieved when she was young (can't give too much of the plot away. The young Blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is in love with Elizabeth uses the help of the legendary Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to help him find her. Captian Sparrow however, has other motives which unfold in the plot later on.Geoffrey Rush makes a fantastic pirate. You can tell he is having loads of fun and masters every line he is given. You almost feel sorry for his ruthless villian at one point.There was alot of hype about young Keira Knightly before this movie came out. She is supposed to be the new ""It"" girl in hollywood. Quite frankly, I found I was a bit dissapointed. Sure she does look nice in a corset, but I never felt for her character, and in fact, whenever she was on screen I wished the story would jump back to Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom's section of the story.Orlando Bloom was not given as juicy a part as the rest. He had to deal with playing the sort of square romantic lead, but handled it admirably. I am looking forward to what he will do in the future with more gritty material. He is incredibly charming and you can't help but love him.Now then, to the Holy Grail of the movie and one of the most originally played recent movie roles in cinema...Captian Jack Sparrow. He is constantly drunk (or just loony), you get the feeling from his various slaps in the face that he does not treat women with great amounts of respect...but you fall for him instantly. Johnny Depp is the best actor of his generation, period. I heard from several sources that the character in the script was not written the way he performed it. Johnny Depp took it upon himself to create this outstanding 17th century rock-star fellow. Sparrow just oozes with this strange feline presence and an even stranger sex-appeal.The only complaint people have about the movie is that it runs a tad bit long, which is true. 2 hours and 15 minutes is a bit long for a pirate movie, but then again, this isnt your average pirate movie.Rated PG-13 for some scary moments and fight scenes.There is no bothersome blood or gore, this movie would really be fine for most children (none ofthe children in the theaters were bothered). Lots of skeletons, but thats about it."	5.0	yo-ho-ho and buckets of fun!!!!!	2003-09-07	2	2	0

The second it started, I knew I was going to like it for some reason. This movie is by the Disney company, and some scenes are pretty violent and scary, but this is a movie a lot of kids love because of it's lighthearted humor and sense of adventure. The skeleton pirates are really cool, and the film is just really fun to watch.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1QD88A7WSFMGL	Gabi	I'll admit, when I first saw the trailer for this film, I thought, &quot;Well, AHAHA. Another Pirate (based on a ride no less!) film to sink in the box office. Nice job, Disney.&quot; But, being a huge Lord of the Rings fan, I had to see for the sole purpose of the beauty that is Orlando Bloom.And, what do you know? 'Pirates' ended up being my favourite film of the year! Johnny Depp is absolutely hysterical as Captain Jack Sparrow, an ubsurd yet charmingly insane pirate who wants nothing more than to get his ship back from the betraying Barbossa, played to perfection by Jeffrey Rush. When Barbossa kidnaps the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly), Jack teams up with Elizabeth's childhood sweetheart Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). All the while, stiff anti-pirate Commodor Norrington (Jack Davenport) brings up the rear in his own attempts to rescue Elizabeth. As previous reviewers have noted, this film would've sunk without Johnny Depp, who suprised many first-time-fans with his unconventionally comical skills. Bloom, Knightly, Rush and Davenport were also perfectly cast and give devoted performances. This film shows what diverse actors Depp and Rush are, and certainly converted me :)The plot is oh so perfectly Disney. Skeletal pirates, cheesy one-liners, happily-ever-after ending. And yet is was so much more. As Disney's first ever PG-13 film, 'Pirates' is action-packed and fast-moving, a just plain *fun* watch. When you're not drooling over the cast's good-looks or marveling at Depp's acting skills, you're caring about the characters and dreading the end.The DVD contains a film-geek's dreams. A hysterical blooper reel (&quot;Arrr, swash swash buckle buckle&quot;), documentaries, deleted/altered scenes, diaries, and so much more. The cast commentary of Keira Knightly and Jack Davenport is particularly fun (&quot;Look at my cleavage!&quot;).Overall, a fun film for kids and adults. I hear tell of a sequel with all the cast returning (with the exception of Rush and Jack the Monkey). Hopefully we'll have a Pirates 2 to look forward to next year!	5.0	Arrrr, mateys!	2003-12-06	1	1	0

Night Shyamalon documentary, and all of his other twitchy movies...you will find that the number of twitches in each one is divisible by 3)-so I suppose 3/5	3.0	Hokey.	2006-07-07	7	1	6

I almost laughed out loud in the opening scenes where the little girl was at the stern of the ship singing ""it's a pirates life for me"".  As the movie went on, we realized that we were seeing scenes re-enacted from the Orlando attraction!  Even down to the dog holding the keys to the jail in it's mouth and the jailed pirates trying to coax him over!The movie was simply fantastic.  It had enough romance to keep Grannie interested and swashbuckling for me.  When we walked out of the movie Grannie said ""that's a classic...we're going to get the DVD when it comes out!!"".Today we're babysitting the grandbabies so our kids can get off to see it.  I didn't know who this Depp fella was, but Grannie fell in love with him!  One reviewer mentioned there was very little swearing in it.  I don't recall ANY.  A Disney film like they used to be.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3UAIZBLYG8WXS	Geek Mama	Went the second day it was out and was gratified to see that they hadn't messed it up (as they did with the unfortunate Country Bears--so sad). Have been on the PotC Disneyland ride maybe thirty or forty times over the years, and it would have been distressing if they had not done it justice.No worries. The whole thing was beautifully done. It's visually stunning--costumes, sets, locations, ships bounding over the waves, not to mention some great CGI; well written, with the kind of humor that appeals to all ages and clever references to the elements of the ride; the musical score excellent.The cast was great too. Orlando Bloom, sans blond Legolas wig and elven ears, was convincingly heroic and quite amusing; Keira Knightly was a revelation, stunningly beautiful and believable as the feisty heroine; Geoffrey Rush was wickedly wonderful as Barbossa--aaarrrr! And then there's Johnny Depp. I don't think I'd seen any of his movies since, like, Don Juan de Marco, but I remembered how amazing he was to watch, and so it was in PotC. He exudes some kind of weird, irresistable charm (witness every review for this movie, even the negative ones,  in which virtually all rave about his performance). In fact, the first time I saw PotC I found it a little slow in the last half, what with waiting for him to come on screen again in various parts (the second time I saw it I felt it flowed along just fine). His creation of Captain Jack Sparrow is quite brilliant, and, in spite of the movie's excellent production values, is what brings audiences in for repeat viewings.It's obvious that everyone involved had a great time working on this film. Here's hoping they have just as much fun doing the sequel! Can't wait for the further adventures of Captain Jack & Company!	5.0	Walt would be pleased...	2003-09-16	1	1	0

I couldn't wait fot he DVD to come out.  When I finally got the DVD, I watched all the extras and this DVD is jam packed with extras.  They say there's over 10 hours of extra stuff.  I'm not sure that it's quite that much (several items are repeated, especially historical commentary), but it definitely was interesting and plentiful.My biggest disappointment though, was the DVD version of the movie.  IT WAS NOT WHAT I SAW IN THE THEATERS!!!  Quite a few of the scenes were shortened!  Most of the shortened scenes were included on the DVD in the Deleted &amp; Extended scenes section, but I wanted to see the version that I saw in the theaters.  My wife and I were both very disappointed in this little trick.Maybe the version we saw in the theaters was eventually shortened later in it's run.  I saw the movie the week after it came out.

I went home and downloaded wallpaper and the trailer. last night I took my 11 year old daughter to see it and she loved it, because she wasnt scared like she thought she would be.  I am seeing it again tomorrow with my 16 year old son and my daughter.  Johnny Depp is awesome as Jack Sparrow.  My daughter did not believe it was the same guy from the astronaunts wife.  The efforts, and the monkey were incredible.  I will totally buy the DVD as soon as its available and I probably will see it a few more times on the big screen.	5.0	Awesome	2003-07-14	0	0	0

The pirates trilogy is wonderful fun. Part cliffhanger serial, part pastiche, it works on every level. To not see it complete is sad, to not own all three is a tradgedy.

Excelent actors, the special FX don't overshadow the story, plenty of sword fighting and swashbuckling, and eye-candy. The jokes are actualy funny, and if you pay attention you can catch some side reffrences to Tresure Island!

He should have taken home an Oscar for this preformance. As Jack Sparrow he is fun and believable! The story is great and the action is awesome. I am a huge fan of Walt Disney world and have ridden the ride which this movie is based and have to say it was very cute to see some of the exact scenes come to life in the movie (like the part where Jack, in his prison cell, is trying to get the dog holding the keys to his cell to bring them over to him, which is at the end of the disney ride)... The story centers around Depp's character and his adventures on the ghost ship the Black Pearl. The movie has stunning graphics and amazing costumes.

It is wonderful family fare for all but the littlest, as the pirates turn to scary skeletons in the moonlight, and there is a fair amount of violence.  They are, after all, pirates!Our children enjoyed linking the scenes in the movie to the various aspects of the DisneyWorld ride.  They are easily recognizable, and quite funny.Johnny Depp kept the character of Captain Jack Sparrow from being a sterotypical, ""avast me hearty"" type of pirate.  His portrayal showed Captain Jack as dark, humorous, selfish, loyal,dispicable, lovable and more...  Johnny Depp is a master of creating memorable characters.  Captain Jack stands well with Edward Scissorhands, Don Juan DeMarco, Ed Wood, Gilbert Grape.This is Disney's summer between ""Nemo"" and ""Pirates.""

Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom capture the whole sprit of the Pirate life.  It makes you want to just start swahbuckling along with the characters. I was a bit skeptical of this film at first. Movies that seem to be inspired from rides, board games or video games can seem like dodgy business, but Disney and Gore Verbinski did a great job cooking up a decent plot and adding a little supernatural element to the whole story.You have hand it to Johnny Depp.  He definitely stole the show playing the quirkiest pirate that existed on screen who still exhibited warmth, wit and charm.  If you think back on the Pirate movies you've seen, name the one whose personality stands out like Captain Jack Sparrow.Adventure seekers can identify with this.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AQJQVZJCAS9HU	"""gloryshod"""	Johnny Depp thoroughly captivates as the swashbuckling Captain Jack Sparrow, with exploits that border on, nay, plunge over the edge, into the stuff that legends are made of.  Geoffrey Rush is endearingly dashing as William Turner, the misguided hero rushing off to save his love and finding himself in the midst of it all.  The filmography is stunning, with legend and reality mixing readily at the thrust of a sword or the light of the moon.  Some of the premises laid down to facilitate the story line defy logic, but this does not detract from the true fun of watching this movie.  I was exhilarated the first time I watched it, laughing out loud in the theater, applauding swordsmanship & articulation alike.  The one-liners are exquisite, providing a wealth of script for the soon-to-appear Black Pearl cult, in the tradition of Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I have been to the theater twice already to watch this movie, plan on taking my whole family, and will be buying it once it becomes available.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A17JB33WWOX2B0	G.M	O.K. Now I know I'm gonna get alot of stick for writing this review, but to be honest, that's the reason that I'm writing it.When this film was first released I was on holiday abroad. Once returned from the sunny skys of Budapest and dropped straight in to the miserable cold weather of London, the thought of this film was all I had to make me feel glad about being home.To be honest, I just missed it. The movie was no longer main stream when I got back but I was determined to see it in the cinema because of all the great things that I'd heard about it.Eventually it came by to a cinema near me that always gets films a few months after thier scheduled release.So that was it. The hype had hit me full on, and I couldn't wait. I sat in that row during the trailers expecting to see the next best thing since Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.Well, that's not what I got. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, and had thier not been so much hype around it I probobaly would have enjoyed it alot more, but I really can't see what all the fuss is about.Yes, Jhonny Depp as always is excellent. The problem though is that he is really the only good thing about it.Scratch that.He is the only good thing about it. Every other character is pretty boring and the story was lacking in every respect.This film is about Pirates. It should have been an adventure.Example, they could have crashed on to a deserted island (Which they did) and found some underground tunnels with booby traps and cool interesting stuff like that. It should have had more imagination and tension. Kind of like The Goonies.Anywy, that's my opinion. I was dissapointed, but I blame myself really. There's really no point getting worked up over a Bruckheimer film.Especially a Disney one.	2.0	G.M	2004-04-09	11	4	7

The thing about this movie is that it's truly awful, really, and I do mean that in all sincerity despite the fact that I recommend it and think it's just plain terrific fun. As anyone will tell you, Johnny Depp is worth the price of admission and the movie deserves some credit, if only because it allows Depp the improbable yet workable platform to take the logic defying leap he does with his character Captain Jack Sparrow. It's hard to recall another character so singularly engaging...perhaps Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka? Aside from Depp, there's not much else left. Keira Knightly is hardly the toothsome heroine men would go chasing vengeful undead pirates to save and Orlando Bloom, playing the gallant suitor, is as dry and crusty as week old bread (it's difficult to discern if this dry and crustiness is the fault of the script or the actor).The movie is silly and pleasing. Think Indiana Jones meets the Goonies, minus Stephen Spielberg's expert direction. I'll sum up this movie in two words: Johnny Depp.	4.0	To sum up: Johnny Depp	2004-02-04	2	2	0

It is hard to pinpoint all of the reasons I loved this movie, but I think THE most important reason is Johny Depp's performance! He was the best thing to happen to this movie. Another key element, was the visual effects. It was really refreshing to see special effects do more than just blow things up or have flying karate fights!

I did go in to the theatre hoping to have fun. I was not disappointed, I was actually incredibly surprised. I was blown away by the performance of Johnny Depp, pleasantly thrilled by the character played by Orlando Bloom, and enjoyed the swordplay immensely.The movie started out a bit slow, providing the background in a dream or a memory by Elizabeth Swann and then progressing to the present and illustrating something of the characters in the present of the movie. Thereafter the appearance of Captain Jack Sparrow starts the ride that leads through humor and high seas adventure reminiscent of the swashbuckling movies in the past.Most of the action took place in melee as there was little cannon play. The melee was fun to watch and easily took over the screen. Most of the main characters had reasonable backgrounds and motivations.I enjoyed the cinematography, as well as the soundtrack. There was no ""pop"" music that tried to push the movie, or to take it out of the time it was set in. Overall I enjoyed every aspect of the movie. It easily took me back to the era of the movies Captain Blood or Treasure Island, but surpassed them in all categories.When we came out of the theatre, my wife and I could not stop talking about it. I ordered the DVD from Amazon as soon as I had the opportunity, and schemed for a way to get back to the theatres to see it a second time. I was not disappointed. I have enjoyed the DVD as well.If you enjoy fun movies with action and character, this is a must have.

When you feel the need to escape to the land of your youth, this a good choice and one that is a pleasure to see more than once. Johnny Depp is his usual charismatic self and Keira Knightley is anything but difficult to look at--and a charming character she plays as well. It's lots of fun for its inherent silliness.

But I was wrong.""Pirates"" is a fun trip through the high seas led by Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom.There are great performances in this film, Depp is absolutely wonderful as Captain Jack Sparrow, the half insane, just plain goofy pirate. He's easily endeared to the audience, and he's fun to watch.The most surprise I had came with Bloom's performance. I loved him in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but I didn't know if he'd be able to carry a film like ""Pirates."" He doesn't carry it, Depp does, but Bloom holds his own in comedy and earnestness. The duo have good timing with each other, I hope to see them in another film together.Geoffrey Rush also delivers a marvelous performance. I couldn't even recognize him, and he gets so lost in his character he is almost indistinguishable. Definitely another notch in his belt; he's a wonderful actor, and he gives it all in the film.The script is pretty good although the plot is taken from about 5 other stories and combined (but that's ok, because it really works)The effects are great (much better than ""The Hulk"")- It's fun to watch the pirates become skeletons.I'm not going to say anything about the plot, because it's too much fun to have it ruined.

That's a Hollywood movie with an old recipe making profits easily.Yes, kind of you already know everything in the first minutes that there will be a happy ending, a love story and heroism everywhere.The only thing I will say it's Pirate doesn't create anything new. Many Pirate movies have been made in the past with the same kind of story. Okay it's maybe funnier but well with all the money they had, they could have found a better story where the plot and the final are not so foreseeable and better told.I found some incoherences here and there showing the weakness of the screenplay.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2NSDLHSG4YBHV	Gwen A Orel	"I've only been to Disneland once (and Disneyworld once) and I'm not sure if I even went on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. so I'll be one of the people becoming more interested in the amusement park after seeing the film...I'd heard people say this was a really fun film-- and I'm in theatre with friends who are sometimes a little bit snobbish about pop culture-- so I did expect a fun, lighthearted, well-paced movie.This was all that but so much more. First, it was extremely well cast, with characters who never sink into cliche. The British sitcom ""Coupling's"" Jack Davenport plays the Commodore who wants to marry Keira Knightly, the lovely daughter of the governor. In the wrong hands (and apparently, according to the commentary, in an earlier draft) it would be so easy to make him a jealous, swinish brute (a la Titanic). Instead he is a true antagonist with his own complex emotions and an overall nobility.Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner, the blacksmith's apprentice found in a shipwreck by Keira Knightly and her father (played smartly by Jonathan Pryce). Geoffrey Rush as the sinister Captain Barbossa (whose mutiny gained him the ship The Black Pearl) is likable, an Irish rogue with style.But Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow completely overwhelmed me and stole the show. Basing his somewhat effeminate, androgynous characterization on Keith Richards with a little Pepe Le Pew and a little Bugs Bunny, his pirate captain is sexy, funny, tricky and brave. He's a marvelous protagonist/antihero-- you always trust that he'll get out of danger, and that where his actions may seem treacherous, he has a larger purpose. At one point it even looked like he and Knightly would hook up! though it was probably a better choice to keep the young ingenue and leading man together. But I was bowled over-- had no idea Depp was that creative and accomplished.But leave aside the cast, and there's still a dynamite story with an unexpected twist-- the pirates are cursed and are seeking to restore treasure, not to get it and spend it. This allows fantastic special effects (they turn into skeletons by moonlight) and a little bit of pathos (they can't taste or feel, because they're dead). But the movie keeps its silliness and light sense of humor-- the pirates are pretty stupid thugs and that makes them endearing.The ships, forts and battles are magnificent. the DVD extras show just how much work and planning went into them and it really is impressive.The movie is also greatly helped by one of the best action-picture scores since Star Wars. No strike that-- it IS the best score since Star Wars (the original).This has all the joy and derring-do of any Errol Flynn, with the special effects of the 21st century.Like the best ride at an amusement park, when it's over you just want to line up and see it again!"	5.0	Exhilerating ride!	2004-08-30	4	2	2

Muiz ""sppartacus"""	I'd like to make clear that four stars, to me, means a really good movie. A lot of people have said a lot bad things about this movie, but the truth is that the movie has: great acting, a very entertaining plot (and credible, considering the type of movie), amazing visual effects, decent direction...what else? Of course, they did a wonderful job reproducing some of disney's ride scenes...oh yea, and great score. In synthesis, it is a very good movie, very entertaining, funny (and for moments even dramatic), and I believe it'll become a classic in the future.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2GPN2VKS8E77C	HAMLET	"Based on the popular ride of the same name at Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (""The Rock"" ""Con Air"", ""Top Gun"", ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Remember The Titans"", TV's ""CSI"", ""CSI: Miami"", ""CSI: New York"", etc) who knows a thing or two about making a kids film with plenty of action, suspense and special effects. This movie is no exception. With a strong script written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (""Aladdin"", ""Godzilla"", ""The Mask Of Zorro"", etc.), this film is PACKED with action, romance and adventure. GREAT film. Keira Knightley (""Bend It Like Beckham"", ""King Arthur"" [also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer], etc.) dazzles as Elizabeth Swann, the woman loved by William Turner, a young blacksmith with a mysterious past (an excellent Orlando Bloom, ""Troy"", ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy, etc.) and Commodore Norrington (a terrific Jack Davenport). Excellent music by Klaus Badelt (""Catwoman"", etc), star peformances by all and awesome special effects. Why'd the MPAA rate this excellent adventure movie PG-13? Only reason I can think of is so that it'll attract teenagers like myself. Adding 5.1 DTS Surround Sound was an inspired choice, because you can experience the picture in all its original theatrical glory (the movie grossed about $601 million; not bad for a Disney film). Disney is at the top of their game in this movie. Hope work on ""Pirates Of The Caribbean 2"" starts soon, 'cause I'm lookin' forward to a sequel to this adventure on the high seas. This is a movie for the whole family, though some images MAY prove frightening for children as young as 2. Directed by Gore Verbanski. Rated PG for violence."	5.0	Heart-Pounding Action, Awesome SFX!!

I didn't keep my hopes up because I figured that the movie wouldn't be really good. I mean, Disney was so desperate for an idea that they used a theme park ride for inspiration. It might not be worthwhile, right? WRONG! I loved the movie. It begins with a 12-year old Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and a governor's daughter named Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) when they first met out at sea. Elizabeth notices that Will is wearing a pirates Aztec gold piece around his neck and takes it so that no one accuses him of being a pirate. Then time takes them to the present (at least for them it is). A hilariously funny pirate by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow comes to their town and stirs up some trouble. When the cursed pirates of the Black Pearl arrive for that Aztec gold the adventure begins. I don't want to give away the whole story so I'll stop there. Anyway, I guess you could say that it's a typical unanimated (is that a word?) Disney movie. But don't let that stop you. This is a great movie and I recommend it to anyone who wants to give it a try.	5.0	One of the best movies this year!	2003-11-08	1	0	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A39LOCOS6YYP0A	"Hazel West ""highlandwriter15 (Author of 'Free..."	So I wrote these for my blog originally, but I decided to put them up here as well. If you liked this, read the others because they're meant to play off each other.Pirates of the Caribbean I: Curse of the Black PearlThis is the best movie out of all of them, I will admit, and I liked this one for a lot longer than the others. But yet, there are still lots of flaws in it. First of all, I would like to put forward my opinion on Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. Did this guy ever play a normal roll? I can't figure out why Jack Sparrow is everyone's favorite character. He's filthy (Not like Aragorn from Lord of the Rings filthy--he who can wear grease very well--but stand-five-miles-away filthy), he's a very bad pirate, and why do all the girls like him because he's not even good looking? Yes, real pirates and seamen were dirty, but Jack Sparrow would never have survived in real life as a pirate. He understands little to nothing about tactics, he seems to play everything by chance, and he's not a character anyone can particularly sympathize with. Your main character cannot be the comic relief. It does not work that way. You can't sympathize with him because he's a huge daftie who is more than a little crazy, and he doesn't even really have a redeemable character. So what is the point in making a character like this, espicially one you're supposed to root for?Moving on to the other characters in the movie: Elizabeth. I will say something for this series and that is that they NEVER ONCE succeeded in creating a likable female character. Elizabeth is just the kind of female protagonist that I CANNOT stand. She's so gaga in love, but yet she can't decide who she should actually be in love with. Commodore Norrington? Will Turner the blacksmith? or, yes, even smelly Jack Sparrow the pirate who saved her because she fell into the water when her corset was too tight. We obviously see she and Will are going to end up together, why bother with this insane love triangle (or rather, love square)? She's not even smart, and she assumes she can do everything. And where exactly did she learn to fight with a sword? it just magically happens all of a sudden. She's such a predictable, typical female character that always shows up in movies like this that it's just boring!Now, Will Turner wasn't so bad, though he was a bit of a static character because he really didn't change at all through the whole series, and if he had been really smart he would have just left Elizabeth alone and found a better girl because she had a serious track record of getting men killed and she wasn't even worth it. This isn't my favorite role for Orlando Bloom, I thought he did much better as Legolas and way way better as Buckingham in The Three Musketeers, but I don't really have anything against him. He does okay in the role of swashbuckling hero but yet his character's nothing really special. I think this is mainly because everyone gets overshadowed by Jack Sparrow who should really be the comic relief side-kick instead of the main character.Now the two characters I liked were Barbosa and Commodore Norrington. Barbosa was a great pirate and if he had been the main pirate in this series instead of Jack Sparrow I probably would have enjoyed these movies a lot more. He had that classic swashbuckler Errol Flynn feel to him, and I love that. He had all the best lines as well, and frankly, he was the only person who ever did anything (besides Will) in the whole movie! Now Norrington on the other hand, was a great character, though I might be biased because I love the British Navy (mainly because of Horatio Hornblower). I think Norrington had a lot of potential to be great... if he had been cast as a character in a Hornblower or Jack Aubrey type movie. He didn't need to be stuck with all this supernatural junk and it ended up being the death of him, literally. Oh wait, that was actually Elizabeth...but I get ahead of myself.Which brings me to the main problem I had with this series. This first one was not quite as bad as the others. I could get the Aztec gold and how it was cursed and the bone pirates weren't too bad either. Still a little weird for a classical swashbuckler, but not as bad as it gets in the later movies. The plot line in this movie was definitely more understandable than the ones to follow. At least there were no moments where you had to sit and stare at the TV going...wait, what just happened?This movie seems to have a happy Princess Bride ending to it. Will get his (air-headed) girl, Jack gets his ship. Norrington...well, he gets the shaft, poor dear, but you know what? He didn't have to get stuck with Elizabeth! He should have been happy!But, unfortunately, despite appearances, this was in fact not the ending, it was a start of another one of those really long and utterly tiring movie series that by the fourth or (heaven help us) the fifth everyone starts groaning and writing reviews like this... *shifty eyes*But moving on...	3.0	My POTC Reviews Part I	2012-05-19	2	0	2
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A28ILXH590CMRJ	Hazen B Markoe	"When Disney films first announced that their classic theme-park ride, ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" would be made into a movie, you could practically hear the amazed laughter from the nation's critics.  After all, wasn't their last attempt at basing a movie on something so trivial, THE COUNTRY BEARS, a dismal flop?  It also didn't help that pirate-themed movies hadn't done well at the box office for almost 20 years.  Imagine everyone's pleasant surprise when THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL turned out to be the surprise hit of the summer!!!!  In the tradition of such recent films, THE MASK OF ZORRO and THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, this flick took a seeming classic genre and reinvigorated it in a huge way.  Director Gore Virbinski and his excellent cast pull out all the stops in creating a fast-paced swashbuckler that pulls the viewer in from start to finish.  The plot covers the attempts of the raffish Capt. Jack Sparrow (a wickedly funny Johnny Depp) to reclaim his old ship, the cursed Black Pearl, from his former first mate, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush).  Along the way, Sparrow must help a love-struck blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) rescue his love (Keira Knightley) from Barbossa's clutches.  With his sun-addled manner and sly looks, Depp is an absolute hoot as the crafty Sparrow.  Like the pirate he plays, he practically steals the film with his comic performance.  Orlando Bloom, best known as Legolas from THE LORD OF THE RINGS flicks, gets to show off at his dashing best as the romantic lead.  Keira Knightley, who was only around 18 years old when she filmed this, shows a savvy range beyond her years as the feisty heroine.  Geoffrey Rush is a perfectly nasty Barbossa, while Jonathan Pryce is amusingly stuffy as Knightley's father.  At 2 and half hours, the film can use a little cutting, mainly in some of the over long mass fighting scenes....but that is merely a minor criticism of an otherwise wonderful movie.  PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN:  THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is a delightful escapist adventure and a film that I highly recommend."	5.0	Excellent PIRATES Continues Swashbuckler Revival	2003-09-09	3	2	1

Baldwin	I found Pirates of the Caribbean_The Curse of the Black Pearl a wonderfully fun movie.  I love the wonderful characterization that Johnny Dep does of Captain Jack Sparrow.  Know for odd-ball roles, he is finally found one where he has hit star status, which has been long overdue.  Keira Knightley is wonderful to see in action and is going to be a big star quickly as she, for her youth, is quite an accomplished actress.  Orlando, whom was wonderful as the elf, Legolas, in the Lord of the Rings, whose carreer as an actor actually go its take off in that trilogy, likewise is great as the young love interest and heroe that is trying to save the Governor' (played with a properly tongue in cheek aplumb by Jonathan Price, who tickled my funny bone) daughter, Keira's character.  Orlando really learned a lot from LOR stint and is growing into being as great an actor as Leonardo Decaprio.  Look out Leo, you got competition coming up.  Jeffrey Rush as Barbosa was a wonderfully devious and sinister yet farcicle Captain of the Black Pearl.  The effects are superb and they really worked flawlessly with the movie.I found the behind the scenes extras very informative and fun to watch, as much as the movie itself.I enjoyed the whole package and can't wait for all the others to be added to my collection.  And to think that this was inspired by a Disneyland ride/ attraction.	5.0	Pirate's Delight	2007-05-06	1	1	0

I mean, come on, a movie based on a ride? That pretty much suggests that Disney is out of ideas. But upon seeing this film and learning that Johnny Depp was in it totally changed my opinion. It was awesome. Yes, Orlando was a bit cheesy as the blacksmith desperately in love with Keira Knightly but all in all the movie was highly entertaining. Seriously, it doesn't matter who you are, you will enjoy this movie (unless you are a bitter old man in which case you probably don't like anything.) So, to sum up: Johnny Depp is the hottest 40 year old I know, and Orlando ain't too bad looking either. Yarrr.	5.0	It's all about Johnny	2003-11-04	2	1	1

Depp told them that they could fire him if he couldn't portray the character as he saw fit.I would actually rate the extra features higher than the actual movie.

The pirate movie be back and, blimey, if it be keelhaulin' the scurvy-ridden bilge that be marooned in yon summer theaters.Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl is a big, sprawling adventure.  The kind you don't see anymore and it's a damn shame.  The script is smart.  It allows the characters to figure things out.  It keeps you in the film.  Yeah, it may be a tad too long at its two hour and twenty-four minute run time, but it flies by a good portion of the time.The acting is superb with not a single person acting in any self-conscious way that would reveal they are in a pirate movie.  Geoffrey Rush is great as Captain Barbossa with his pirate-like growl.  He even utters ""Arrrr"" much to the delight of the audience.  Casting off his turn as an elf, Orlando Bloom takes on the unlikely hero role with vigor enough to prove his acting chops.Of course, the real star here is Johnny Depp as the fey pirate, Jack Sparrow, a pirate captain without a ship.  In fact, Depp gets the best movie entrance this summer in a leaky, sinking dinghy.  His character he claims is based on Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones and it shows.  He is half-crazed and swishes around delivering the best lines in the film.  Yet, he is completely believable and never goes (dare I say it?) overboard.  I say it's about damn time the Academy stood and noticed one of our generation's most versatile and creative actors, but that's just me.Pirates is one of those adventure films that will have you grinning with pleasure through most of its high-spirited hijinks and is right behind Finding Nemo for pure summer fun.

Give that man an oscar! :-)Orlando played his part well too. I swooned over his love for Elizabeth (though it should have been directed at me.. sigh) Anyway he was so sweet and so perfect.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AU8TZKV2M0K5R	"Illya Kuryakin ""illya_kuryakin"""	In this very entertaining film Walt Disney shows Steven Speilberg that you can have attractive young actors and still make a good film. I've never been a Johnny Depp fan, but in the role of Jack Sparrow, pirate captain, Depp's bizarre, over the top acting style fits perfectly and brings the film to life. He is fantastic, and I actually found myself hoping he would win when he was nominated for the academy award (he lost). Orlando Bloom - who made his name as the Legolas the teenage heart-throb, extreme sports elf in The Lord of the Rings - is another pretty face who does his role justice. His job is easier - playing the straight-man daring young hero - but he does it admirably. Too bad Spielberg didn't cast Bloom or Depp in Catch me If You Can, it would have been a much better movie. Another real treat in Pirates of The Caribbean is Keri Knightly, who I had never heard of and have never seen since. She is an absolute stunner and she gives a strong performance too boot. Overall a very fun, entertaining movie. It has a good pace, it isn't too predictable (even if it is a pirate move based on a Walt Disney ride) and some of the characters will break formula and surprise you from time to time. One note to parents, we bought the movie on the advice of our neighbors who have a three-year-old girl who loves it. Our son Elias, also three, watched the movie incessantly for about a month then suddenly decided one of the scenes was too scary to watch (explaining its appearance in our lending library).

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3USRUCHAOC3MT	"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff"""	"Let me get to the point.  This is a movie that is filled with adventure and thrills, and is fun at the same time.  Want to stick around for a more in depth look?Picture being an eight-year boy living near Anaheim when Disneyland opened their new ride ""The Pirates Of The Caribbean"".  I was that eight year old boy.  I left singing ""Yo ho, Yo ho, a pirate's life for me.""Fast forward a little past four decades, when I finally popped in the DVD of the first of a trilogy of movies ""based on a theme park ride"" (as critics say).  Actually, there are a few scenes in common with the ride (including my favorite, of the dog with keys in his mouth as imprisoned pirates are trying to get the dog in reach to snatch the keys).  There were times I was wondering if I would hear the talking skull and crossbones.  There was a scene when some of the characters were taking a boat into a cave, and I expected them to descend down a waterfall like on the ride.  But they only sang the song a couple of times, and not complete in either case.This is a summer special effects adventure.  There was one scene that made me think about an Indiana Jones movie.  Let me repeat that line:  There was ONE SCENE that made me THINK about an Indiana Jones movie.  This is a compliment.  It is not a bad thing for an adventure movie to remind one of Indiana Jones; there have been so many adventure movies, it is inevitable for parts of it to have been done before.  The Indiana Jones series is adventure at its best, and it made me THINK of that series, not LONG for it.  There's also a scene that will make you think of Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, and again it is a similar event in both stories.The story telling is excellent.  It gives you bits and pieces that you will remember as the movie progresses, though it does call for a large dose of suspension of unbelief.  There are lots of twists and turns, and while I guessed one climatic action, most of the movie kept me guessing.One thing this movie does better than Indiana Jones and ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" -- it is much more fun.  There are movies that have such good all around cast chemistry that it seems like the actors are enjoying their job, which helps me enjoy the movie.  No, this movie didn't earn any Oscar nominations, but the characters are memorable, and even the villains were enjoyable and fun to watch.This movie is PG-13.  I think that if a parent watches this with a nine or ten year old and talks to them about it, it would be okay.  (Those who know me know I believe that parents should always be with their children when they watch a movie, even a G-rated one.)This movie is well done, but don't anticipate my watching the other two movies in the series any time soon.  You can say part of it is having watched a movie recently that I regretted, which was a sequel (""Addams Family Values""), so I'm not sure the sequels are as good as the original.  And while I enjoyed it, I did not love it.  It was an entertaining waste of time.  But if you have two and a half hours to spare and want an exciting fun movie, this is a good choice."	5.0	A Thrilling Two And A Half Hour Ride, But Do I Want Another Trip?	2009-02-02	0	0	0

He played his role flawlessly and I doubt anyone could have played his role as a thief and a pirate better. He does an amazing accent as well.Aside from him, the movie keeps you attentive at all times - you are never bored, always entertained... and the humor is very tongue in cheek, which is nice if you like a little intellectual humor from a boat thief.The computer graphics of the ghosts and zombies was VERY realistic. You could see a lot of time was put into making this movie. Nothing was left untouched. I have great respect for everything in this -- simply because in every scene your eyes are wandering all over the screen to just inhale everything you are watching.

He's a bit swishy, a lot irreverent, and very very funny. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is also a scene stealer and Orlando Bloom and Jack Davenport counter with great stick-up-their-butts characterizations.  While I wasn't that impressed with newcomer Keira Knightly, (her voice and diction aren't the greatest, and the little singing she did with Jack on the island was like nails on a chalk board), she did have great chemistry with the other castmembers.The movie is huge, and I had wondered how well it would translate from big screen to television, especially during the epic galleon-to-galleon sea battles, but it does very well indeed. The sword fighting and stunts are exciting and believable and the entire look and feel of the film have both the kids and the adults shrieking with delight.  This is a *pirate* movie, after all, a swashbuckling, derring-do, romantic, sweeping movie.  I know it's supposed to be based on the Disney attraction, but anyone who hasn't been on the ride need not worry.  Anyone will be able to appreciate it.The bonus features of the dvd are great, and there's a lot of them, plenty of interviews and behind the scenes features.  My favorites are the diaries, especially the one for the ship, the Lady Washington, which was sailed from Long Beach, CA., to the Carribean where the they needed her for filming.  She was overhauled and revamped to look like the military vessels of the time, and she plays the Dauntless in the film. I also liked the blooper reel.  I suspected that everyone who had a hand creating and making the movie had the time of their lives doing it, and this confirms it for me.I love the music too!  Very invigorating and exciting.

The acting, the beautiful camera shots, the plotline, the comedy, the action - all were great.However, these be dangerous waters for parents.  I decided to not let my kids watch the movie until they are much older. My qualms were not just with the occasional gore and scary skeletons.  In addition, the movie actually recommended piracy (stealing, remember?) in some cases!  They state frequently that the rules are just guidelines.  Plot spoiler: Keira at the end says to Orlando, ""You're not just a blacksmith, you're a pirate"" as if that is a good thing, and that is why he won her heart.  Disney could have skipped that final applause for piracy, and I would have been much happier with the film.  These are the hero and heroine of the show.

I saw it the first evening it hit the big screen, and if I told how many more times since, you'd think I was completely off my onion.Despite a few historical errors and oversights, I found this movie quite riveting for it's own sake, not because of some gorgeously tipsy pirate captain or childlike glee. In my opinion I think Disney did a great thing when they decided on a project as different for them as this. It has a delightful mix of comedy, thrills, romance and drama to satisfy a widespread variety of ages and cinematic preference.Geoffery Rush was wonderful in Les Miserables, and he gave the perfect image of the type of pirate villian we all know and love. Move over Captain Hook! Kiera Knightly gave a promising performance as a fairly new actress, which left me pleasantly surprised. Orlando Bloom gave us a cutie character to grow attached to, however, I don't think this was a role for him. Shows of buccaneers and bravado just aren't his speed.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AMG88KV31ZIIO	Jack Crane	I thought this movie was alright as a college student. Watching it a second time years later, it's boring. It's just a kid's movie, with way too much fluff. The director just wanted to make a 2 hour and 30 minute movie out of sheer pretentious. It's an element that effected the two similarly long-winded sequels. It's quite a shocker that the 4th was actually pretty good, given that the new director managed to efficiently tell a story without ridiculously requiring the film last almost 3 hours!The movie did remind me of all the times I was required in school to write 10 page papers on subjects that only required a few.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2AOBK3UTVL3NA	Jackie	By far, this movie is the best movie I've seen all year!  It's humorous(thanks to Johnny Depp), visually extraordinary (thanks to stunning computer graphics, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley-- did anyone else think she looked like from Star Wars the Episodes?), and an interesting surprising plot.I usually do not buy DVD's but I believe that Pirates of the Caribbean is a must have!  If you intend on buying a VHS, get a DVD player... now!  There are a ton of extra goodies that come with this DVD.  At least 10 hours of bonus material!  I am not sure if there is a full screen version, but the widescreen (almost always is) the best version because the edges aren't cut off and you get to see the director's vision, stunning scenery, and cream of the crop computer graphic imaging.Ok, enough of this cheerleading.  If you didn't like what I wrote so far, let me tell you this- you won't regret buying this DVD!  Enjoy... I know I will over and over again!p.s.

There was supposed to be evil pirates, Jack Sparrow has to stop them. The commercials blatantly lied. What we have instead is common criminal pirates who are cursed. All they freakin want is to get the curse lifted from them. What's so evil about that? Jack Sparrow runs around in circles and acts like a fruit, managing to get caught all the time. Nothing they said in the commercials was true. After watching it once at the movie theatre I don't think I could stand to watch it again.If you like Disney family fare, this is for you.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	That film is a gem of humor and action, though at times a little bit slow. It is a lacework of entertwined patterns that give the films a rich dynamism and imaginary broad perspective. Romeo and Juliet : Elizabeth and Bill, the daughter of the Governor and the son of a pirate turned blacksmith. And it succeeds because the Commodore gives way and yields in front of real love. The phantom pirate ship and the phantom pirate crew, the Flying Hollander demultiplied. And the curse is lifted giving victory to the rejected pirate captain and to the commodore. The South American treasure lost on some island, in some dark cave, and that is a curse for the pirates but can also be the treasure chest of all those who will survive the curse and there is only one. Perfect resolution of the dilemma : be cursed and be immortal, or lift the curse and die. Brilliant colors and costumes. Brilliant action full of humor.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3MDEYI0URIF50	James Cunningham	This movie is great if you want to go and have a good time at the theater. Everybody in it does a great job but Johnny Depp realy steals the show.This movie had many of the things I look for in a movie, and some things I just hope for.  For example, action, adventure, comedy, ghosts, an enjoyable story, and some good wholesome violence!Perhapse what made this movie most enjoyable for me was the lack of any major child role in the movie. Considering that this movie was made by disney, quite frankly surprises me.In fact I was unable to find any anoying character inserted for the comedy relief which so often destroys a potentialy good movie. Their were no Jar Jar Binks, their was no screaming Asian kid as in the second indian jones movie, thier was not that goofy back stabber from The Mummy that you just wanted to see dead, none of that, just good people that fit good characters.This may not be for everybody, and if you are looking for some extreamly complicated plot look elsewhere. This is just a good action/adventure involving pirates, wrapped up in a ghost story, with some great acting thrown in for good measure.If you liked Big Trouble in Little China, you should like this flick, check it out!...if you enjyoed Chocolate! stay at home and rent the English Patcient, which is potentialy even worse.	5.0	lots of fun	2003-07-21	0	0	0

I have to say I had just as much fun the second time around.  Johnny Depp just may have his signature role in Captain Jack Sparrow. Not that he hasn't had many other memorable roles, but he plays the rangy captain with such irony and wit, making him one of the more gracious pirates of the silver screen.  Geoffrey Rush, as Capt. Barbossa, wasn't half bad either, as he led a motley crew of zombie Pirates in a quest to regain their lost humanity.  Sort of anyway.  The romance between Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley was carried to absurdist lengths, but nicely resolved in the end.  Jonathon Pryce is priceless as Keira's doting dad, willing to go to any lengths to please his darling daughter.  But of course Bloom has to fend off a challenge from another suitor of higher station.  The whole thing is just a barrel of fun, never losing its mad cap momentum, even when the scenes seemed totally preposterous.  A bit scary for the little ones perhaps, but not without a little parental guidance.	5.0	Shiver me timbers, matey!	2006-07-10	2	2	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A34CVPZ30BA4GD	James Robert Dator	'Pirates of the Caribbean' may have been one of the more awaited films for the 2003 summer. When the first teaser trailers were released one could here comments from the audience ranging from 'Dude, we gotta see that!' to 'Huh?? Johnny Depp's in it'. The film is a well drawn, classy pirate film. It's nice to see that even though top grossing film has aliens or expensive cars, a Disney pirate film can top the box office list. So what makes 'Pirates of the Caribbean' so attractive as a film?To answer this question one must look at all the components of the film. To see the idea on paper would make one cringe. It's a film based on a Disney theme park ride where pirates fight skeletons. Not necessarily the most original idea ever created, though what makes 'Pirates of the Caribbean' an original film is the performances which serve their purposes brilliantly, I will elucidate on this further later in this review. The story centers around Elizabeth Swan, the daughter of a high ranking official in the British navy who is living on base in the Caribbean. On their original voyage she meets a shipwrecked Will Turner. It is clear from this first meeting the two will be inextricably linked. From here the story jumps ten years where Elizabeth (aptly played by newcomer Kiera Knightly) and Will (Orlando Bloom) are still good friends, though coming from different social backgrounds makes them 'star-crossed lovers'. When Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives at the colony a chain of events are set in motion bringing the mysterious ship 'The Black Pearl' to the island. From here the film is a 2 hour action/adventure feast with amazing effects and fantastic swordfights.It is truly the deft direction by Gore Verbinski coupled with the brilliance of the cast which makes 'Pirates of the Caribbean' shine. As with all pirate films suspension of belief must be donned upon entering the theater and all preconceptions abandoned. Johnny Depp is brilliant as always as Jack Sparrow. A mix between Errol Flynn and a punch drunk boxer his performance serves it's purpose perfectly, he's really not a nice character, but is so darn charming you have to forgive him. Orlando Bloom plays the competent all around good guy, which is less fun to watch; but is needed to drive the story. Kiera Knightly does a great job of eluding the 'damsel in distress' stereotype by being a very gutsy female lead. Proving that this newcomer can hole her own with Depp and Rush equally. With all great films a good antagonist is at the heart of any action film. Geoffrey Rush plays the horrible Captain Barbarossa, who is again a charming individual that would be the near perfect adversary if he wasn't a skeleton. Verbinski manages to keep the films levity throughout. If 'Pirates of the Caribbean' was designed to be a serious expos&eacute; on pirate life it would be a 2 hour yawn fest. He manages to keep the film fun, something that is always needed. Whenever you can look at an audience and see people smiling at what they're seeing you know you're doing a good job.Sound and special effects are amazing. Disney aren't slouches when it comes to the time and effort spent on effects and they are never obtrusive, so the audience feels overwhelmed as many films achieve. The score is a brilliant mixture of sea shanties and swashbuckling adventure music. A perfect mix for a film that is set hundreds of years ago but is still as interesting now as ever.The overall impression of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' is it being a film made for fun. Something that an audience member can sit back and for over two hours be thoroughly entertained and captivated by not only a fantastic storyline, but a brilliant cast, great screenplay and wonderful direction. This film will most definitely be one of the biggest blockbusters of the 2003 summer, and it's easy to see why. A fantastic pirate film and a great adventure film at a time we all need one.	5.0	A Film to see for some pure, swashbuckling fun	2003-07-16	1	1	0

'Pirates' moves right along with scene after scene of excitement and enchantment.  To put it simply, this movie puts you in another world.  It is just incredible entertainment, so rare to see such a well done movie these days.The score is flawless!  It fits the movie perfectly and keeps you enticed all throughout.  The best part about this movie is that it never gets boring.  And I mean that.  Every scene is something new and intriguing.  It can also be watched over and over and over, you won't get bored I promise.This movie is also done tastefully.  It is not overly violent or overly sugar coated.  Noramlly in Disney movies if characters fight they resolve it quickly.  The fight scene is very minimal in violence and no one ever dies.  This movie does kill a few off but it's not a gore fest.

(In fact, there's now a skip in it. Any suggestions?) She knows every line and has played the music from the score (which, by the way, is excellent) in her middle-school band. I have been sucked into the movie several times, each time amazed at the depth of layer of character Johnny Depp has given to CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom is eye candy, although the part could have been played by any number of today's young actors. The locations are beautiful, and the special features are quite funny and informative. I am incredibly impressed by the computer-generated graphics, especially the scene of the crew of The Black Pearl at nighttime. (If you haven't seen it, I won't give it away.)

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3MRX7LB965Y0T	Janet Seagrave	"The ever-brilliant Johnny Depp has listed his influences for creating the much beloved Captain Jack Sparrow: Keith Richards, Pepe Le Pew and, as TIME magazine just informed us, the mechanical pirates at Disneyland. I see another. El Gallo, the Spanish gypsy in Broadway's longest-running musical ""The Fantasticks."" Certainly Captain Jack looks more like El Gallo than the sketches Disney drew of him and we know Johnny helped create his character's look. El Gallo was first played on Broadway by ""Law & Order,"" ""Dirty Dancing, and Broadway star Jerry Orbach, who died last year.

I could go on that ride for days and never get tired of it, it is so much fun! So, when I heard Disney was releasing a feature length film based on my favorite Disneyland attraction, I was very curious to see how they were going to pull this off. Boy, was I blown away by this movie! I love the references to the ride throughout the movie, it shows the filmmakers were fans of the attraction as well. They even had the world premier of the movie at Disneyland, which I thought was brilliant. But what makes this film so much more than just a tribute to the ride is the performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow-without a doubt, one of the most unique and fun characters to ever grace the big screen! The cursed crew of the Black Pearl is awesome too, the special effects work on this literal ""skeleton crew"" was incredible, and the character of Captain Barbossa is the perfect pirate nemesis too!When I think of pirates, I think of my favorite attraction at Disneyland, and when I think of pirate movies, I think of this film!

And here be a truly wonderful cinematic experience! Johnny Depp, wow, what more can I say, the man is absolutely marvellous. He is without doubt one hell of a package. Besides being very handsome he can also act, and act well! He is the heart and soul of &quot;Pirates&quot;. Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), former captain of &quot;The Black Pearl&quot; is out for revenge and Captain Barbossa is the target! Barbossa , his mutinous first mate, is played perfectly by supertalented Geoffrey Rush. His witty dialogue and pirate brogue add a wonderful touch to this adventure. Barbossa and his crew of &quot;msicreants&quot; are cursed as a result of stealing treasure that has a sordid history. They need to lift the curse by finding the gold coins of Cortez that doomed them to an eternity of living death and wash the curse clean in the blood of &quot;Bootstrap&quot; Bill Turner father of &quot;Will&quot; Turner, played by Orlando Bloom. The significance of Bill's blood is not really developed but that is not necessary in keeping the movie on course. Ms Swan (Keira Knightley), her father(Jonathan Pryce) and her admirer, Commodore Norrington(Jack Davenport) all play significant roles and the acting throughout is suberb. Without giving too much away, Will and Jack embark on a duel purpose adventure to rescue Ms Swan and seek revenge on Barbossa respectively. The result is a swashbuckling, rip-roaring pirate adventure set in breathtaking locations and non-stop action. This, along with another notable adventure concerning hobbits, happen to be my best pics of the year.

Pirates of the Caribbean deserves its popularity. The highlights of the entire film are the uses of computor technology. Another addition that saves this flick is the stylish acting of Johnny Depp. He is simply hilarious as Captain Sparrow, and steals the entire show. Geoffrey Rush also delivers a haunting performance as Captain Barbosa. Orlando Bloom is our true hero, and saves the &quot;damsel in destress.&quot; (Kera Knightly)There is no straightforward plot to this, as it focuses on the talents of Depp and Bloom. Background characters do not have as much depth. as usual.This is an enjoyable flick for most people. However, it may not appeal to people who want a smooth, downbeat story.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2X5FCG9AUP9VP	jcphoenix	Most of the time, I am a sucker for the smaller, twisty mysteries and thrillers ala Mulholland Dr., Memento, Brazil, Identity and Vertigo. I love extraordinarily complicated plot twists, and quirky films. That said, Pirates of the Caribbean may well be the most surprising choice for me to make as the early contender for the best film of the year.Pirates is an adventure film in the spirit of the Indiana Jones trilogy - it is lovingly crafted, and a whole lot of fun. Johnny Depp is one of the most surprising choices for a lead actor in a summer Bruckheimer movie, but is he ever perfect in Pirates. The dialogue is witty to begin with, but Depp invigorates every line with an entirely fresh interpretation. All others acquit themselves nicely (Bloom on his way to becoming the next Brad Pitt? and Rush and Knightley putting in stellar performances), but Depp is without a doubt the star of this show.The curse (the pirates turn into skeletons in the moonlight) is a nice twist on the normal pirate movie, giving this enough originality to leap out from the rest of the genre. The fight scenes are well done, but also startlingly original. Typical fight scenes are usually rather straightforward, but in the case of Pirates, sometimes it almost feels like a Jackie Chan movie in that they make use of many things in the fights. Not only that but often, the fight scenes are laced with humor, and, surprisingly, originality.It's hard to pinpoint what exactly makes Pirates work so well, but perhaps the best way to put it is that it simply has everything I come to expect or want from a movie these days. It has its eerie moments, its funny moments, adventurous moments, sad moments - it has romance, adventure, mystery, horror...the movie is easily accessible to anyone between the ages of, well, 5 to 95. And contrary to the seemingly popular opinion, this movie went by like a breeze for me. In fact, the only problem I could think of for this film is the horrificly lengthy title.I know that almost everyone will enjoy this film at the very least, but this is for me the epitome of great movie making. For me it even surpasses such stellar mindtwist movies like Mulholland Dr., Memento, and Brazil. Why, you ask? The three mentioned are fantastically original, but sometimes that's not enough. I love those three to death, but Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the single most entertaining movie I've ever seen. No, the storyline isn't the most creative ever but boy, that dialogue sure is smart and witty. They make magic on that screen for the full two hours and a half running time, and that is what going to the cinema is all about. I'll be watching this one for many years to come, and perhaps that's the single best compliment I could ever give a movie.p.s. to the reviewer who said that (s)he was disappointed about it being only widescreen - well in case you didn't know, 99% of films today ARE FILMED IN WIDESCREEN and are meant to be watched like that! FULLSCREEN MOVIES are almost all the time PAN &amp; SCAN which means they just cut off the left and right sides of the picture and expand it so it fits your tv, so you get in many cases over 50% loss in picture. The black bars are NOT blocking off any picture or anything, it's when u have fullscreen that you're losing picture. If you don't want to watch a film the way the director intended it to be filmed, then don't buy it. PLAIN and SIMPLE. I'm glad that more films are being released on dvd for only widescreen now slowly but surely, as half the people in the world still seem to be so ignorant of the fact that PAN &amp; SCAN/FULLSCREEN is not the way the director intended the movie to be. (the only exception is movies made around the 1950s i believe and before...those were originally filmed in fullscreen and are meant to be seen that way)	5.0	Pirates is amazing!

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AOVJYIUATQKR5	JediMack	The whole family enjoyed this action-adventure-romantic comedy.  Sometimes it is hard to write a script that combines those 4 elements into a coherent story but it all works here.  There is no nudity or simulated sex or fowl language.The special effects are above average, with an occasion WOW!  The battle scenes when the bad pirates attack Port Royal is awesomely shot and visually very realistic.  You will see scenes with sets that you will recognize from the Walt Disney World attraction.Even those who do not care for Depp (because he has said he hates the USA and has moved to France) will agree he does an excellent job playing Capt Jack Sparrow.For my son, there are two things that make a movie great.  Swords or Litesabers and Sword-Litesaber fights.  This one has plenty of excellent sword fights.  Early in the movie Capt Jack Sparrow and Will have a very inventive sword fight that combines this movies hallmark, action with comedy.  The hugh sword in the end of the movie is marvelous fun, reminding one of the great fight at the end of THE MUMMY with Branden Fraser.Jack and Will end up teaming up to rescue the fair damsel.  There is sufficient romantic tension in the film to keep my daughters interest.  The movie moves along at an excellent pace keeping everyones attention all the way.I couldn't give this 5 stars, because there are other swashbucklers I like a little better, but it is a strong 4 star movie you will want to buy and own.	4.0	Above average Swashbuckler, visually superb!	2003-12-06	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2V3P1XE33NYC3	Jeffrey Leach	"If someone told me six months ago I would soon watch a film based on a Disney amusement park ride, I would have kicked him or her in the shin. Heck, if someone told me I would watch a Disney film six months ago I would have kicked them on the other shin and called it a day. I avoid Disney films like the plague--with a few notable exceptions mostly involving some of their older animated features--because I think the quality of their cinematic endeavors has dropped markedly over the last couple of decades. Yet I can now say I've watched ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."" I didn't willingly seek this movie out at first, however. I heard so many good things about it, mostly focusing on Johnny Depp's character, that I felt I should give it a look. Too, my girlfriend raved about the movie after seeing it in the theater with her sister. And we all know what happens when the significant other loves something: he or she insists on inflicting said object on the other individual in the relationship. Looking back on the experience, things could have been much worse; I could have ended up watching the latest Jennifer Lopez or Meg Ryan flick.""Pirates of the Caribbean"" begins by introducing us to Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) and his daughter Elizabeth (played as an older girl later by Keira Knightley). The two are sailing from England to Port Royal, one of the country's Caribbean possessions, when the ship they are on comes across some wreckage in the water. They find a young boy, Will Turner (later played by Orlando Bloom) clinging to a piece of debris. Suspecting pirates are to blame for the destruction of this vessel, it's no surprise that we catch a glimpse of an ominous ship sailing off into the fog. We soon learn that this boat is likely the legendary Black Pearl, a cursed pirate craft that supposedly ran into trouble with some stolen treasure a few years back. Or something like that. Anyway, Turner comes aboard and the boat continues its journey to the island. Flash forward a bunch of years as Governor Weatherby Swann and his now teenage daughter plan her impending marriage to Commander Norrington (Jack Davenport). Will Turner stayed on at Port Royal as an apprentice to the island's blacksmith and, predictably, carries a burning torch in his heart for the divine Elizabeth. Of course, Elizabeth really loves him but class concerns prevent such a union.Then the movie throws a wrench into this unfolding romantic drama as Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives on the island in glorious fashion. He's a pirate by trade and disposition, no doubt about that, but he's also this film's salvation. He struts about in gaudy clothing, drenched in mascara, and spouts off the most irreverent dialogue. In no time at all the authorities take him into custody and prepare to hang him. He escapes, of course, just in time to witness the arrival of the Black Pearl and the destruction of Port Royal. Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), the Pearl's commanding officer, came to Port Royal to find the one thing that can remove the curse from him and his crew. What that is I leave for you to discover, but the search for this item leads to lots of sailing, battles full of clanging swords, and plenty of comedic moments. Turner soon becomes involved, of course, as he and Sparrow team up to defeat the nefarious Barbossa and rescue the beautiful Elizabeth in the process. As for the curse, it turns out that all of the pirates onboard the Black Pearl suffer a curious affliction involving rotting flesh and gleaming bone. They're dead, in short, but kept alive to roam the high seas for all eternity unless they can lift the curse.""Pirates of the Caribbean"" languishes under what I consider one serious flaw, namely the length of the film. Good god this is a long movie! I don't mind watching lengthy films, but give me a break! This sucker rolls on forever, far longer than is necessary to get the job done. Worse, I kept hearing cues that seemed to hint that the movie was winding down only to hear the music launch into another series of soaring crescendos followed by more scenes. I threatened to break my watch if time didn't start moving faster. I'm extraordinarily pleased to see other people complaining about the runtime since I suspected I was the only one who thought the film needed some serious editing. Aside from the totally unnecessary two plus hours of high seas hijinks, most everything else worked well. The set pieces looked convincing, the acting was quite good, and the effects showing the crew of the Black Pearl morphing into their true undead forms very nearly redeems the overabundant use of CGI in most films today. Without Johnny Depp's totally outrageous Jack Sparrow, however, the movie would have foundered. He truly is as awesome as you've heard. The filmmakers are nuts if they don't greatly expand his role in the upcoming sequels. I won't watch them unless Depp gets more face time.If you thought the movie was long, wait until you start watching the DVD supplements. The sheer number of extras included on the second disc boggles the mind. The commentary tracks alone, three of them, will keep you up so long you'll need to take a nap in Davey Jones's locker to recover. I say give ""Pirates"" a whirl if you haven't seen it if for no other reason than Johnny Depp. If you've got a short attention span, however, this movie may prove daunting in the extreme."	4.0	Is there an editor in the house?	2005-04-27	1	0	1

You cannot help but watch his every move, wondering what he would do next.Orlando Bloom plays the idealistic blacksmith as Geoffrey Rush plays the evil pirate in control of the Black Pearl.

Keira Knightly is gorgeous as well as tough and Orlando Bloom gets to use some of the sword fighting skills he learned in Lord of the Rings.  The story centers on a ghost ship, The Black Pearl, which is full of cursed pirates.  Jack Sparrow is the rightful Captian and is looking to get his ship back.  The current Captian, played by Geoffrey Rush, is only intrested in removing the curse and doesn't care who or what gets in the way.  Knightly plays the girl who doesn't want to marry the stuffy commander that her father has betrothed her to, but finds something in Blooms character that drives him to her rescue after she is kidnapped by the Pirates.  The adventures take us all over the Caribbean, to seedy ports and hidden caves.  Broadsides and sword fights ensue as the everyone wants something different, whether be a ship, the last of a set of cursed gold coins, or the woman you love.	4.0	A Pirates Life for Me...	2003-12-24	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1MEF49W2J0YSH	jem	i honestly didnt expect this film to be up to much. i mean, it was based on a disney theme park ride which didnt exactly 'float my boat'. however i was pleasantly surprised when i went to see it at the cinema. the characters were well cast,t he script was smooth, and the fight scenes were impressive. it has to be one of my top movies of the year. i had expected it to sink at the cinema, but with a cast containing orlando bloom and johnny deep, this is definately one film that will easily sail into my top ten when it is released.	5.0	pirates of the carribean	2003-11-14	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2LPN3K8LTSYOY	Jenna	I am not kidding when I say that this movie ranks as one of my most favorite movies of all time! It ranks in the top 3 and maybe even grabs that top spot! Its close to it!!! I enjoyed the movie from front to back and could not think of having any more fun in the movie theaters than I had with this movie. It has everything from action, to comedy, to romance...it truly is a well put together film! Now lets skip all the technical stuff and get to the goods: the one thing that kept this movie together and kept me going to see it a second time and most likely a third time is the ever so charming Johnny Depp. His performance was unforgettable and one for the ages. Johnny Depp was born to play the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. No one and I mean NO ONE could ever play that role as well as he did. He deserves an Oscar for that performance! It was unbelievable! And Orlando Bloom now has a new fan in me! What a cutie pie! Don't believe anything the critics say! They must have been watching a different movie because the one i saw (twice) was not too long and did not outstay its welcome! I'm sorry if i have a brain capacity that can withold a 2 hour and 30 minute movie! Apparently critics dont! Take it from me, its a truly enjoyable experience watching this movie! I cannot wait for it to come out on Dvd!	5.0	Truly Brilliant!!!	2003-07-16	3	3	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3TKGM2JJJC1I3	"Jennifer B. Barton ""Beth Barton"""	Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a pirate captain without a ship ... or a crew. However, he seems to keep finding both as he helps solve the mystery of the ghost ship the Black Pearl and its cursed crew, helps one man discover the pirate within him and helps the beautiful Governor's daughter affirm her love for pirates. This is a very good swashbuckler with no anachronistic details to deter you from a good time (except for the obvious caste difference in the romance department). Swashbucklers and historical sticklers will like this universally.The DVD also has lots and lots of bonus features that are great. Be sure to watch the deleted scenes.  There are tons of them and some really should have been left in.  The bloopers are also good.  It is hard to believe that this is the same Johnny Depp that was in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.  I believe that he has gotten younger and his mannerisms ... you'll just have to see it for yourself.	4.0	Amazing Cinematography, Lots of DVD Bonuses	2004-01-24	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A31HGIGKNKCC2C	Jennifer Black	"To start off, I'll say that there are two things I hate, hate-hate reviewing. Classic novels and blockbuster films. Pirates about tops it on the blockbuster list. Okay, maybe Titanic surpasses it... but that's a review for another time.So anyway... I liked it. Duh. Everyone likes Pirates. But I have to admit... I liked it for the characters more than the plot or even the fantastic special effects. Because as supernatural and contrived as this ragtag group of buccaneers seem at first glance, they're just... fun!  Jack Sparrow... who doesn't love Jack Sparrow? I mean seriously. Orlando Bloom is hot. Oh, wait, the character, right. I like Will. The stereotypical hero-turned bad boy.  And Keira Knightley, also, is hot, I have to admit. And quite a good actress -- as I understand it, this was her breakout role. It actually makes me curious to see Pride and Prejudice -- it says something about her acting if I actually have DESIRE to go within thirty nine and a half feet of something related to Jane Austen. But I digress.I will also mention that I saw this movie for the first time before I ever watched BBC (I think it was BBC) series Ultraviolet, starring ""Norrington"" actor Jack Davenport. I'll say, after paying more attention to the character on the second watching -- he's a great actor. The character's... nuanced in ways I didn't pay attention to before.I'm not going to rehash the plot, because if you haven't already seen it, I don't want to spoil it. But it seems to me it could have used one more... twist. The only ""major"" setback for the villains the audience is anticipating, and everything ends ""as it should"". But again, not spoiling anything...If you haven't seen it, go rent or buy it. And then get the sequel. And the third film."	4.0	Good fun and entertainment	2008-01-30	1	0	1

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	This film is a pirate movie in true Monkey Island style. In case you've never played that game it means lot of fun, crazy pirates, a beautiful lady and a bunch of zombie like pirates. I must congratulate the people who did this film. To make a movie based on a theme park ride is pretty risky. And the fact that it is positively excellent amazes me, and credit is due to the filmmakers. I'm impressed.This film is a thrill ride, an action adventure of the classic formula; a dumb plot, good actors, good action, good laughs and just good fun. It's the closest thing to ROTLA I've ever seen. Gags, laughs, cheers, action, great-acting, swordplay, gun-play, adventurous score, even some mystery/twists and great pace: all here. All good.The score for the film is perfect. It's adventurous and definitely has a Caribbean sound to it. It always works. It helps get your pulse pounding. It's eerie at times as well. The visuals are as well stunning. The underwater shots look awesome and the Caribbean is great in landscape and detail. The effects of the undead look simply great.The actors have all been perfectly cast. Orlando Bloom is believably innocent; just the blacksmith, the unexpected hero. Kiera Knightley is not so much the damsel-in-distress, but can take care of herself. Geofory Rush is a terrific villain. He gets the part nailed down perfect. He delivers every line without cheesy flare, and with believability. He's excellent. But Johnny Depp absolutely steals the entire picture. He's extremely entertaining and funny, but also a very clever man, who knows what he's doing. His actions all match his character, and he's always great to watch.The story may be cheesy, but it's greatly presented in terms of pace and excitement. It even has some mystery to it, and suspense that comes well together.  Filled with high-sea action including ship battles, and fancy swashbuckling goodness. Supported by its excellent cast, it's a great fun film ride.	4.0	"Have you ever played ""Monkey Island?"""	2006-07-18	5	5	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AWO4PGPM9ZAW7	Jen Wintzinger	I dont know if anyone really cares about the opinion of a 16 year old obsessor of Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp but in this movie, they are absolutely AMAZING. Along with Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley of course. The whole cast of this movie was WONDERFUL. So wonderful, in fact, i went back to see it 4 more times. This movie is a PERFECT blend of action, drama, comedy, and romance. I was constantly laughing at the amazing character that Johnny Depp put together, and at the same time swooning at the beauty and bravosity of Orlando Bloom. Though the DVD is not out yet, i anticipate its coming and know it will not disappoint me. What more could a john and orlando lover WANT with BLOOPERS, and DELETED SCENES to see more of the men i so openly desire.In this movie, I thought keira knightley did an exellent job as elizabeth. At first i was soo green with envy that she got to KISS orlando and dance drunkedly around a fire with johnny, but she was so good at playing the governors daughter who isnt your ordinary damsel in distress -- i had to admire her. It is her idea to go back and save the man that she truly loves from the undead pirates of the caribbean. She was an exellent addition to this film.I also think geoffrey rush was the IDEAL man for the part of captain barbossa. He was so good at bringing out the essential evilness of the pirate that even hell couldnt handle. He as well brought a fair share of comedy to the movie, and i really enjoyed the swordfight between him and johnny depp.I would recommend this movie to ANYONE without a second thought. Its a wonderful piece of art that deserves many, many awards. I hope everyone that gets this DVD is as pleased and as overjoyed as i will be... a side note .. this is the first review ive ever done .. so if its like totally not what im supposed to do .. uhh .. im really sorry.

Johnny Depp's character Jack Sparrow is a comedian in himself. The way he talks, acts, his expressions, it was priceless. It left me leaving the theatre wanting more and wanting to be a pirate myself(haha). Johnny did an extroadinary job with really bringing out his character, he says and I quote ""I kind of thought pirates of the 18th century were really the rock 'n' roll stars of that era"". Interesting isn't it? Johnny definately rocks up the film! I greatly recommend this movie.Orlando Bloom also has done another spectacular job.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3R78JZG5N6E3Z	Jessica	Personally, I hated the Pirates ride at Disneyland, and until I saw this movie, I thought that the pirate genre in general was rather uncouth and not anything that I wanted to find out more about.  I only went to see the movie because my whole family was going and because I thought that Orlando Bloom was attractive, in an earnest 20-year-old kind of way.However, after seeing this movie, I was disappointed with Bloom's performance.  I was also disappointed with Keira Knightly's and Geoffrey Rush's performances.  This is not to say that they were bad; all three of them were actually quite good.  However, the show was undoubtedly stolen by the incredible performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.  Having once portrayed a drunk man onstage, I can tell you that it is one the most challenging things that I have ever done.  Throughout most of the movie, Depp appeared to be both slightly drunk and slightly off his rocker, which made an interesting combination.  Now, I've read many reviews that lauded Depp's performance, and left it at that.  By the end of the movie, though, I was wondering what I ever saw in Orlando Bloom, as Depp was quite the more attractive character, in the physical sense.  Bloom was cute and sincere, but cute and sincere gets dull.  Depp,however, came off as mysterious and unpredictable, which to me is far more appealing.The plot itself isn't exactly complex and the scriptwriting certainly won't get any Oscars, but Pirates is more than worth the [cost of] the ticket, at least once.

Better yet when I originally went to see the movie in the theater, there were quite a few kids filling the seats...so it's a good movie to watch with children. (Good babysitter material.) I think Depp truly embraced the character of Captain Jack Sparrow, and Orlando Bloom was great as well.

It could've been terrible if it wasn't done right. It was done right though, has a great cast, good direction, nice special effects and great action. The script is just a little weak though. With lesser actors this movie might not have worked. I do see that's it's a little silly to have sword fight after sword fight with pirates that can't be killed though. I guess they think if they cut off enough limbs they won't be able to fight back anymore.Johny Depp is so much fun that it's easy to over-look that it's silly to fight un-dead pirates. His character and performance could've made even Cuthroat Island a good movie. Hell maybe even Muppet Treasure Island lol. His character is odd and totally original. He's an excellent actor don't know he has never been nominated. He adds much needed wit to the movie as does Geoffrey Rush as the cursed villain. Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) and  Keira Knightley play it straight but are still strong in their roles. Orlanda Bloom is well on his way to being a big action star. Too bad he wasn't around in 1991 because he would've made a better Robin Hood than Kevin Costner. I hear their might be sequels, as long as Johny Depp comes back as Captain Jack Sparrow...I say bring them on. As for making more movies based on Disney rides.

The special features and out-takes are great.  Although I am not a big Johnny Depp or Orlando Bloom fan, they were both FANTASTIC!  Captain Jack Sparrow and his antics were some of the most entertaining bits I've seen in quite some time.  Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa is unbeatable and I only hope they can resurrect him for the sequel.  One of the best parts of the movie is the crew.  Every pirate had a personality and trait that made them unique and not just an extra.  This movie is an absolute must have!	5.0	Should Have Won The Oscar!	2004-08-17	4	4	0

The guy has played everything from a freak (Edward Scissorhands) to an outcast (What's Eating Gilbert Grape) and now a pirate.  The man oozes talent.  I was taken with him the first minute his face graced my screen.  He isn't pretty is this film, he's not even cute, he's just THAT good.  I became disappointed every time we left him to go visit another character.  Although, the other characters were entertaining.  They just weren't as much FUN!  I hate pirate/ship/ghost ship movies, but this one broke through my tough critical skin.  I laughed out loud and thoroughly enjoyed the ride. I thought it a bit bizarre to write a movie based on a Disney theme ride, but the filmakers did an outstanding job.  Witty, brilliantly acted and even a little frightful, this movie has everything.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2AM2A4GZQ0NTY	J. Leong	I can't help but be a bit bias about this movie.  A movie with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom is just so appealing to me, it hardly matters what the movie is about.  But, even though I say that, I actually really did enjoy the plot.  It was a bit cheesy, I can admit - especially when Elizabeth says &quot;You like pain?  Try wearing a corset&quot;.  That was beyond corney.  But you've got to take into account that this movie has to appeal to children as well as adults, as it is a children's movie.  So I suppose corniness was just for the children's enjoyment.  Other than that, this movie has it all: action, romance, humour, suspence and much more.  And has the power to make you sit on the edge of your seat.  Enjoy.	4.0	Ain't that right, Savvy?	2004-03-19	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A8F2AZWB20X1H	JLind555	I'm not a big fan of action/adventure movies, especially movies based on theme park rides, but this one brought so much hype with it, I figured I'd check it out.  I should have trusted my instincts.  As adventure movies go, it's fairly pedestrian; a lot of action and noise, mega-zillion-dollar special effects; we've seen it all before.  But a good cast helps make the movie watchable.  Keira Knightly makes a sweet-sassy heroine; Orlando Bloom is winning and likeable as her young hero; and Geoffrey Rush is suitably malicious as the evil pirate captain, sneering and leering through a mouthful of teeth that never saw a dentist.  In fact, all the pirates are excellent; nothing romantic about this lot -- they look and act like the dregs of humanity they are supposed to represent.  But without Johnny Depp, the film would be eminently forgettable.  Depp is a knockout hamming it up as the hapless Captain Jack Sparrow, raccoon eyes smoldering and flashing inside rings of black eye shadow; he's a marvelous comedy actor and gives the movie a dimension it would never have had without him.  In fact, he's the main reason I was able to sit through this film.  Aside from its length, the movie doesn't demand anything of us, you just take it or leave it, however you're so inclined.  I can leave a lot of movies of this genre; but I can definitely take more of Johnny Depp.	3.0	Depp hoists it	2003-12-25	0	0	0

It's just not the type of films I usually enjoy, but after all the hype I had to see it. I absolutely loved it. Johnny Depp makes this film. He is so funny and likeable creating one of the best characters in recent movie history. Keira Knightly also does a great job. She turns in a sexy, fiery, and fun performance as Elizabeth. Orlando Bloom makes the most of his supporting role, but it's Johnny who steals the show from everyone. The special effects are nothing like I have ever seen. Brilliant! When the pirates turn into walking skeletons, it will amaze you. Pay special attention to the final fight scene between Johhny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. I was amazed at how well the effects came across and did not look fake at all. I highly recommend seeing this film. It does not disappoint and lives up to all the hype.	5.0	Wow!	2003-12-07	1	0	1

So I wasn't that keen on seeing this. Plus the fact it is a Disney movie, that added another mark against it. When I heard Johnny Depp was playing a pirate and modelling his character on Keith Richards, I became intrigued. Depp is one of, if not the, premier actors around. As Jack Sparrow, he steals the show. The rest of the cast do excellent jobs also. The movie has a good pace, has some humour and some great effects.

It is fun, interesting and keeps the attention. It may not be great dramatic art but it is a lot of fun.The story concerns the pirate captain, Jack Sparrow, played by Depp, and his quest to avenge himself of a mutinous crew and a stolen ship. What complicates matters immensely is that the crew and the ship are now under a curse and cannot be killed. Those same crewmen will do virtually anything to rid themselves of their curse and the ""cure"" involves an act of human sacrifice. Not just any human will do, it has to be the last living descendant of another pirate. That is where the love story comes in.The movie is both macabre and funny. The naval scenes are laughable in terms of accuracy but enjoyable just the same. I just love old ships. Depp plays his character with gusto. He is vain, self-centered, crafty, dry of wit and hilarious.  This one is not to be taken seriously but it should be taken.Something to consider is the DVD itself.

All the people giving 5 stars and saying it's the best movie ever are like 11 and 12 years old so don't listen to them becaue they are not old enough to go see any good movies anyway. Johnny Depp delivers the greatest performance of his career. He perfectly portrays the half insane, half drunk Captain Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush also delivers a great performance as captain Barbarossa. Orlando Bloom is on the melodramatic side I think he is in this movie just because he looks like a pirate. He gives a better performance in Lord of the Rings. Kiera Knightley, why is she even in this movie. Her acting skills are at very best mediocre and it seems like the only reason she likes will is because her father doesn't want her to. Overall it is a good movie, it looks great and I love the special effects especially when Jack and Barbarossa are fighting and they change from flesh to skeleton and back again. Jack Sparrow has great lines and Johnny Depp was awesome. Go see it.	3.0	remember this as the day you almost caught CapnJack Sparrrow	2003-08-14	2	0	2

Lots of sword-fighting. What I saw really motivates me to get the dvd. I saw this on USA & they seem compelled to show advertisements every 12-15 minutes, mostly promoting their own shows, over & over & over. This is a rather long movie at 143 minutes. You cannot fit that into a three hour time slot with all those STUPID ADS. Anyway, I never paid much attention to Johnny Depp before. He is delightful as Capt. Jack Sparrow flitting from scene to scene. There's a slight love story. He doesn't get the girl, but really doesn't care. His ship, the Black Pearl is haunted & he wants it back. Elizabeth is Keira Knight the eye candy & only female in the cast. She of course gets kidnapped. She is quite a good comedic actress. Very promising. I can't wait to see the other half of this movie with the sequel coming in dvd very soon I'd imagine. It's a clean movie, fantasy scenes & very kid friendly from what I saw.	4.0	Errol Flynn never was this much fun.	2006-09-26	2	2	0

I have never ridden the ride, but the movie is a blast.  Johnny Depp is a comic actor of force and his stage presence is incredible.  Every scene he is in is marvelous.  The ingenue is gorgeous and the action is fast, furious and believable.  For there to be humor I was told by a teacher long ago there must be believable risk, and you must care about what happens to the characters.  I do not remember why he said it, but I think it is true.One of the best parts of the movie is the sword play.  These people have been to school.  The sword fights do not look like creative camera work, they looks real.  I wonder how long it takes to learn to fence?The characters are not cardboard in the end.  They all grow and believably change as a result of the action.  It is a wonderful flic and I cannot recommend it more highly	5.0	Pirates are interesting	2004-01-02	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	&quot;Pirates of The Caribbean&quot; is quite simply Hollywood's best pirate film in ages; a funny, rollicking swashbuckler that pays homage to the great films of the 1930's and 1940's featuring the likes of Errol Flynn, Charles Laughton, among others. The script is witty and not nearly as cliched as I had dreaded originally, thinking that this would be a lame remake of a great Hollywood swashbuckler. Johnny Depp offers the performance of his career playing the over the top manic pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom takes on the Errol Flynn role as the blacksmith Will Turner, offering a less flamboyant, but equally impressive, performance next to Depp and leading lady Keira Knightly (Elizabeth), the daughter of the resident British governor (Jonathan Pryce in yet another memorable performance which will remind long-time admirers of his work in Terry Gilliam's &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;). Geoffrey Rush is deliciously wicked as Sparrow's former first mate, Captain Barbossa, and Nick Davenport offers a restrained, dignified performance as Elizabeth's fiance, British Royal Navy Commodore Norrington.Captain Jack Sparrow arrives in the British colony town of Port Royal (presumably Jamaica, though never specified), searching for a ship so he can recapture his pirate vessel The Black Pearl. Ten years before he was marooned on a desert island by after a mutiny led by Barbossa and the crew, soon after they found a mysterious treasure chest containing Aztec gold with a terrible curse instore for those who find it. One of the crewmates was Will's father, who sends his son a piece of gold, allowing the curse to endure. Now the Black Pearl sails the seas, a haunted ship, searching frantically for every bit of the Aztec gold. Soon Captain Sparrow will join forces with young Will Turner to find the ship, missing gold, and Elizabeth, a prisoner of Captain Barbossa and his crew.	5.0	Best Film Of The Summer	2003-09-03	38	33	5

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1R3IBEJZB0WOZ	John Newman	This movie's premise is fairly good.  A group of pirates stole 882 peices of cursed Aztec gold, spent it and found that the curse made them unable to be killed, yet also unable to experience life.  To end the curse the pirates must gather all 882 pieces and for some unexplained reason douse them with the blood of William Turner (a deceased pirate) or his descendant.  The special effects, sets and settings are terrific but some of the acting is just too over the top.  Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom is totally unbelievable, Jack Sparrow played by an over eye-lined Johnny Depp is frankly annoying and Commander Norrington is just too inept.  Probably the most annoying part of the movie was the comic relief provided by a pair of British Redcoats and a pair of cursed pirates.  Every time either one of these pairs appeared on screen I cringed.  Johnny Depp has maybe five amusing lines, but for the most part his mincing, overblown portrayal of a pirate captain left me nearly retching.  If this is the best modern filmakers can do making a pirate movie, I see why its a genre whose time is gone.Enjoyable if you are a kid or have an IQ of less than 60, otherwise I'd pass.	2.0	Too over the top	2003-12-31	8	4	4

This was a fantastic movie!  I have seen it three times and I WILL buy it on DVD!  I am not easily satisfied when it comes to movies but this one really did it for me!  I won't talk about what I think about the characters since everybody pretty much speaks for me; they were all terrific.  No complaints.However, I did find one small flaw with the story line.  And, if anyone can point out that I'm wrong, please do so.  I would like to think that it is totally perfect, which it pretty much it is anyway.How old was Jack Sparrow when he lost his ship to his first mate?  The final piece of the Aztec (which was mailed to Wil Turner by his now deceased father) was with Wil when he was saved after his ship was attacked.  When Wil was saved he only looked about 12 or 13 years old.  When Will and Jack met during the fight scene in the blacksmith shop the age gap didn't look that big, infact they looked almost the same age.  Could the Famous Captain Jack Sparrow possibly have had his own ship at the age of 13?  This is my only question about this movie.  I still rate this picture very high and will buy it when it comes to DVD.  Please help if you have any insight about this possible flaw.	5.0	Only One Small Flaw.............Other Than That?

I had a few observations to share that i haven't seen in the other 100+ reviews (well, the ones I read anyway):BARRING THE GHOST STUFF, there was an awful lot of realism and historical accuracy in this movie, with the geography and names of places and times and what not.  Just adds to the enjoyment for me.Though this has been said to some extent, here's my angle.  I was very impressed with the overall production relating plot, humor, action, scenery, and romance.  I was shocked by how good the plot was.  The romance was pleasantly kept to a minimum, and the costumes, scenery, and humor were top shelf.  The use of each of these factors was in perfect proportion to each other; you can't do it better than this movie did it-period.Another way of stating it:  My wife's favorite movies are You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, Father of the Bride I & II, Baby Boom, A League of Their Own...you see where this is going, right?  She sat through all 135 minutes of throat cutting, dirt-under-fingernails, Johnny Depp (whom she can't stand), freaky ghost skeletons walking around, guns and sword fighting pirate flick and LOVED it.Go see Pirates of the Caribbean.

What a nice summer night that was.  The movie, however, I thought was mediocre.  I figured the first movie would have to be better, and it definitely was.Disney's Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl (2003) is everything a pirate movie should be.  It has action, adventure, fighting, treasure hunting, great daytime and nighttime atmosphere, everything you can think of when it comes to pirates sailing the Caribbean Sea.  This movie was based on the Disney ride of the same name.  Johnny Depp delivers a great performance, as does the nice looking Keira Knightley.The special effects are truly awesome.  Sure, some CGI was used, but it wasn't overdone, in my opinion.  This movie really captures the feel and atmosphere and look of the Caribbean and pirate ships.  It was actually filmed in the Caribbean, not in California or some similar place.The second DVD features over 10 hours (that's right) of extras.  Everything from how the movie was made to deleted and alternate scenes, audio commentary, blooper reels, a history of pirates, an image gallery, and so much more.  It'll keep you entertained for, well, over 10 hours.If you like pirates, then you should see this movie.  Entertaining and visually stunning, I highly recommended this movie.	5.0	Everything a pirate movie should be	2010-09-05	3	3	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1N0TKOD1H1HB8	"Jonah Napoli ""spyderfingerz"""	This film is truly a piece of cinematic gold.  From Johnny Depp's flawless portrail of Captain Jack Sparrow, (who is quite possibly the greatest Disney character ever created), to that of the newest hot faces to find Hollywood, those of Orlando Bloom & Kiera Knightley, Pirates has something for everyone.The story is that of young Elizabeth Turner, (Knightley) the stunning daughter of Port Royal's Governor, and her run in with the crew of the Black Pearl, a hoard of treasure-seeking pirates.  With help from the local blacksmith (Bloom) and the bumbling former-captain of the Black Pearl, Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), the three must put to end to the curse haunting the crew of Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and reclaim the Pearl for Cap'n Jack.Definately an experience not to be avoided, despite the film being based on, of all things, an amusement park ride.  Clearly the crowd favorite, Captain Jack always knows what he's doing, despite outward appearances.  As a media critic, I highly suggest this film for anyone looking for action, romance, humor, and if nothing else, some of the prettiest faces ever to hit the big screen.	5.0	But Why Is The Rum Gone?!?!	2003-11-12	13	9	4
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A33CLVW2K7SL1P	Jonathan Appleseed	"Today movies find inspiration from video games, comic books, old television shows - everywhere! Still, it's surprising that a movie was made based on an amusement park ride. I don't know if I'm being silly, but that fact just astonishes me. This will end up, with the release of the third movie, as one of the most successful series of all time, and it's based on a ride!This was a very fun movie to watch, and whenever Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) was on the screen, it was even more so. Keira Knightly is terrific, Orlando Bloom is, well, Orlando Bloom - he was easy on the eyes, and his acting was fine, if not good. Geoffrey Rush as Depp's foil was perfect.The plot was simple and straightforward: there's a curse on some gold that the crew of The Black Pearl stole, and they need to return it to lift the curse. Not much to go on, one would think, but somehow Disney did a terrific job and churned out an entertaining two and a half hour film that didn't feel like one. This was my first time watching the movie, and I'm excited, now, to seePirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest- it was the third film to crack the one billion dollar mark worldwide, behindThe Lord of the Rings - The Return of the KingandTitanic.Obviously I'm catching up with the phenomenon, preparing for ""At World's End"".3 1/2 stars, rounded up to four for the enjoyment factor and Johnny Depp's brilliant Jack Sparrow."	4.0	A fun and entertaining romp for all EXCEPT those who hate Disney films	2007-04-24	2	1	1

He made this movie one of the most entertaining I've seen in a while. Even if you're not remotely interested in the premise see it for his performance. Anyone who does see this movie, though, will have an enjoyable experience. From the special effects to the supporting cast of Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom this movie was a delightful experience. The story draws the audience in from the comical entrance of Jack Sparrow right up until the end. All in all, this movie is one of the best out there this summer, so don't waste your money on the billions of sequels out there which have become monotonous and boring, instead see this movie!	5.0	Bloody Brilliant!	2003-07-09	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AWHLCGP5WW5AU	Jordyn	"One of the rare movies that comes along once in a while that you enjoy so much you want to go back and see it. There was nothing wrong with the whole film. The graphics were great, the fight scenes were breathtaking, and the music was enjoyable. Pirates of the Caribbean is acted out by so many wonderful actors and actresses, Johnny Depp, Geoffery Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley...even those that acted as the pirates were so wonderful that you felt as if they were not acting, but actually real.I have often been asked if it is a scary film, a film that youngsters should skip for awhile. I personally know a young boy in the elementary ages (4th-5th grade) that saw the movie, and begged his parents to go see it again. There are scary moments, but there is also a lot of comedy wrapped into each scene that makes light of a grim situation. Johnny Depp performed wonderfully as the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, who gave us the most laughs. You can tell from the first moments of the movie that he was really into his part.Orlando Bloom played Will (iam) Turner, a heroic blacksmith that deserves a better position than blacksmith, and who is in love with Elisabeth Swan (played by Keira Knightley) so much that when she is captured, he decides to rescue her...but this rescue operation turns into a whole different adventure than he planned. Keira Knightley is the tough and lovely Elisabeth Swan, who ""doesn't believe in ghost stories"" but finds herself in one when she is taken aboard the Black Pearl, lead by the captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush).To keep this already lengthy review shorter than it would be, Pirates of the Caribbean is a rare movie that catches the viewer's eyes and makes them forget the popcorn and gummy bears sitting on their lap. It is full of twists and turns and laughs and action...the plot is one of the best I have ever seen. Once you see it, you will want to sea it again."	5.0	Sea it once...Sea it again.	2003-08-06	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2DSXA1E02C86D	Joseph Haschka	Aargh, matey! Thar never be such a cap'n as this!PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is too long and illogical, but will prove, perhaps, to be one of the most entertaining films of 2003. The reason - Johnny Depp's brilliant performance as Captain Jack Sparrow.As the film opens, legendary buccaneer Sparrow is on the prowl for a ship and crew with which to sail forth and recapture his previous vessel, the Black Pearl, from which he was cast off onto a deserted island after a mutiny led by his First Mate, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Captain Barbossa has been doing his own share of killing and plundering ever since, including capturing a chest of gold coins created from melted-down Aztec gold. Unfortunately, the gold was cursed - a fact not realized by Barbossa and his men until all the coins were spent on wine, women and song. The curse condemns them to an eternal limbo between being dead and alive - they appear as normal men in the day, but as skeletons in the moonlight. To rid themselves of the curse, they must recover all the coins and offer a blood sacrifice. As it so happens, there's but one coin left, that held by Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the son of an original Black Pearl crewmember. Turner, a swordsmith, is in love with Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of the British colonial governor of Port Royal in the Caribbean. Since a Damsel-In-Distress is de rigueur, Swann finds herself abducted by Barbossa and his band of un-dead scoundrels.There are really only two reasons to see PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, and I'll get to those shortly. Otherwise, at roughly 140 minutes, it's way too drawn out, particularly since much of the time is spent by troops of His Majesty's colonial garrison in pitched battle with Barbossa's pirate scum, a pointless exercise since the rascals can't be permanently killed until the curse is lifted. Rush is reasonably effective as the villainous Barbossa, but wouldn't be able to carry the film by himself. Both Bloom and Knightley are young and attractive actors, but their characters aren't much more than animated props to advance the plot. And there's virtually no romantic chemistry between the two.The least of the two reasons to see PIRATES is the special FX that immediately transform the body of a cursed pirate into a raggedly attired skeleton as he steps into moonlight. The transition is seamless. One wonders when such cinematic magic will cease to amaze. The paramount reason is the performance of Depp. I don't know if his interpretation of Sparrow was his own idea, or incorporated into the script by the writers. Either way, it's inspired, and Depp pulls it off with insouciant panache. With eyes heavily lined with black mascara, and mannerisms and deportment seasoned with an hilarious dash of swish, Captain Jack is a swashbuckler of a type you've never seen before, and which will have Errol Flynn rolling over in his grave.I've heard the rumor that there's to be a sequel. I fear that a reprise by Depp of the Sparrow role might get old. But, as a one-time appearance, it's not to be missed.	4.0	Should be JOHNNY DEPP OF THE CARIBBEAN	2003-07-24	6	2	4

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3GKPMHV4U64IY	Joshua Koppel	Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives at Port Royal things begin to happen.  The story concerns Captain Sparrow, the Governor, his daughter, the daughter's intended (a Commodore), and the local blacksmith who owes his life and heart to the Governor's daughter.  Jack manages to save the life of the Governor's daughter, but that is not enough to save him from jail.  Then she is kidnaped by a band of pirates sailing the Black Pearl.  This prompts the blacksmith to team up with Sparrow to go and rescue her.  This they set out to do after embarrassing the Navy.Captain Sparrow used to be captain of the Black Pearl until a mutiny removed him.  The crew, under a new captain, managed to become cursed and are now seeking a way to end the curse.  Apparently they need the Governor's daughter in order  to succeed.  The plot goes through some interesting convolutions as each of the interested parties tries to get what they want.  How each of these plot threads gets resolved will have to wait until you watch the film.The characters are interesting and the plot well-conceived.  Ad some real swashbuckling to modern special effects and you get a pirate tale no studio could have pulled off too long ago.  I was particularly surprised at the integrity of some of the so-called bad guys in the film (there are bad guys and villains).  The ending also worked well without pulling out some cute solution.  This is supposed to be the first in a trilogy but I doubt the other films can equal this one in its better respects (although they will probably outdo the special effects).  A fun film with good acting, solid plotting, and great action.  Check it out.	4.0	Quest for the Pearl	2006-10-18	4	2	2

However, although nothing more than a painfully obvious big scale corporate ploy to increase sales of overpriced theme park admission tickets, souvenirs, concessions and brand name recognition in the fast food, stripmalling bland landscape that has become our contemporary American culture, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is simply the first summer film rich enough to thoroughly deserve multiple viewings. It is the first film in a long time that inspired heartfelt and hearty applause from the audience.Using colorful costume and set design, a fine music score, a surprisingly witty script, gorgeous cinematography evoking both Howard Pyle&#65533;s THE BOOK OF PIRATES and NC Wyeth, director Gore Verbinsky deftly allows his cast to become his greatest special effect.Lustily channeling the robust spirits of Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn and a tinge of the young Peter O&#65533;Toole, Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom create a pair of vivid and dashing heroes who put the swash back in the buckle. Both appear natural born cutlass and dagger men. Geoffery Rush makes a delightfully roguish villain while resurrecting the delectable scenery chewing of Claude Rains, Basil Rathbone and the great god of overacting Robert Newton.Escapist films should play like amusement park rides and PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN does that (as it has for almost fifty years).Simply and purely fun, this is the summer film to savor and celebrate.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2NBOL825B93OM	J R Zullo	"It seems Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is in trouble. Once the captain of the fastest ship of the Caribbean, the Black Pearl, now he's a nobody, shipless and moneyless. He vows revenge on his former immediate, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his former crew, who left him alone on a desert island with only a gun and a bullet. To help him, enter the scene Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), a blacksmith and the daughter of the british governor of Jamaica.Just another pirate story, huh? Think again. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" may not be the most original movie in the world, but if you put together the special effects, the acting provided and a subtle humor, this may well be the most interesting and captivating film of the year.The special effects are very well done and extremely effective. To watch real characters become skeletons and then become real characters again several times in the same scene was very funny and, at least to me, unexpected.The humor contained in the movie is subtle - not the in-your-face kind of humor, but gentle and also unexpected. Not childish humor either, even if the main target of this movie are the children.The actors all do competent jobs. Two of them, though, come to mind to be mentioned in this review. Jonathan Pryce, as the Governor, has one hilarious scene, a pity he was given so little time on screen. And then we come to Johnny Depp. He may be the most talented post-Hanks-generation Hollywood actor. To create his Jack Sparrow he was inspired by Warner Bros. cartoon character Pepe Le Pew. If you didn't know that, watch the movie again, or at least remember Depp's scenes with this in mind. He's perfect, he's THE Pepe Le Pew in human form, from the make-up to the way he talks. Always gesticulating, obnoxious, irritating, and at the same time completely captivating and likeable. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" orbits around Depp's acting, and he's in top form.Top entertainment, watch with no regrets.Grade 9.2/10"	5.0	The curse of Pepe Le Pew	2003-09-13	3	3	0

Kaminski ""j_s_k"""	Pirates of the Caribbean is a decent flick with lots of action and humor. Johnny Depp, as Captain Jack Sparrow, is at his usual best, and the special effects are excellent. The movie is a bit long at 2:20, and seems to drag a bit, but overall it is good fun. Some comic relief (mostly by Depp) helps it along to a satisfying conclusion.

Great cast in this movie, Jonny Depp is a talented actor, although it can be hard to believe when the only reason the girls go to see him is because of his looks, but whatever, that's not the point.  The point is that this movie was by far the best of the summer &amp; you should check it out if you haven't seen it yet.  You don't know what your missing.

I couldn't believe the hype over Johnny Depp in this. Yes, he is a talented actor. Did he steal the show? No. I'm positive why children went to see this, it would be amazing seeing it through a child's eyes. But I saw this film through adult eyes, and I can't say I loved it. Sure it was an O.K. movie, but so was ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"". They should've put more time into the script."	3.0	Pirates of the Caribbean	2003-12-03	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2EMP366TTS6E1	Judith Miller	PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is a well-done action film. Johnny Depp as the off-the-wall Captain Jack Sparrow, dominates the movie and steals the show from the other characters. His performance is terrific! The premise of the story is for Captain Sparrow to recapture his lost ship, the Black Pearl.  The movie is colorful and the special effects are excellent!I'll bet, for children, this film is like an interactive trip to the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride at Disney World. Primarily, the movie is aimed at children. Although, I believe that it might be too scary for children under the age of five or six.	5.0	--Very Entertaining--	2004-02-10	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1H07AEFGBB5OS	Julia	Pirates of the caribbean has got to be the best movie i have ever seen.  If you have not seen it yet i definetly highly recommend it. If you think the commercials are dumb, which they aren't, don't pay any attention to them! I wanted to see this movie ever since i found out Disney was making it and i never expected it to be this good. The movie is very well cast. Keira Knightly was absolutely stunning and perfect for the role of Miss. Swan, i truly wish i was her in that movie...loved by a handsome Orlando Bloom, and stuck on an island with the most gorgeous man alive ( Johnny Depp). Johnny Depp was absolutley made for this part. He did incredible research in his character and made Capt. Jack Sparrow the whole movie, his inspiration for the role of Capt.Jack Sparrow was keith richards and pepe le pew( skunk from looney tunes). Johnny Depp is the best actor i have ever seen, his unpredictableness was so sexy and his humor was off the wall hilarious, and his charm ooohhhh dont even get me started..im so in love with johnny depp. Orlando Bloom was terrific as well, his acting really made u hate the bad guyz and made the girls wishing that there was someone as caring as him out there for us. Capt. boubousa  couldnt have been better!!! Perfect cast, Perfect Plot, Perfect Movie! Disney you have outdone yourself!! the only bad thing about this movie would be if there wasnt going to be a second one!	5.0	Most entertaining film of all time!	2003-08-02	1	0	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1BBM6YT09406G	Julian	"When I first saw the trailer for ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" it looked like a silly kid's movie.  I have never been a big fan of comedies.  I find most of them to be unintelligent and unimaginative.  When I went to see ""Pirates"", I was expecting an overdone comedy, where the actors try too hard and it shows.  That is what I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised (perhaps ""shocked"" is more fitting).Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow was amazing.  The role is an hilarious one; Sparrow is cracking jokes throughout the film.  However, Depp takes the performance very seriously.  The comedy never seems to be contrived for the amuzement of the viewers; instead, we get the impression that the characters aren't aware that they're acting in a movie.I had never really thought much about Johnny Depp before seeing ""Pirates.""  I had seen him in one or two other films, but I never really realized who he was.  This film has placed him as my favorite actor.  I am anxious to go out and rent all of his other movies.  If they are even half as good as ""Pirates,"" I won't be dissappointed."	5.0	"""Pirates"" not what you'd expect"	2003-08-05	0	0	0

I own this DVD and have watched it countless times. Personally, I find the movie quite entertaining. Depp and Rush's performances were very good. They made the movie for me. Other actors I wasn't so pleased with. The film itself is nice with it's graphics,costumes,and sets. The plot was alright but a bit redundant. Also, 2 and a half hours was a bit much. Could have been shorter. I give it between 2 1/2 - 3 stars because I did enjoy it even with its shortcomings. Especially the extras on this DVD. If you haven't seen this film, I suggest you rent it and see if you like it before purchasing. It's a hate it or love it kind of thing.

Thus, when he says something that angers someone, he does not apologize- UNLESS, what he said was grossly misquoted. He does not APOLOGIZE for things he says, when it is properly quoted. His statement to Stern, the German magazine, which is Germany's equivilent of the USA's National Enquirer and other disreputable rag's, was horribly taken out of context. No surprise considering the source.Johnny's rebutle, above, was issued, not as an apology, but as a correction.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A10G4BPT5MGBHY	Julie Neal	"Whether you're new to Blu-ray DVDs or already have quite a collection, this one is a must-buy. Simply put, it has the best video and audio of any Blu-ray title released to date. With its mix of bright and dark scenes, its boatload of special effects and its rollicking layered soundtrack, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a perfect showcase for Blu-ray technology, and Disney has taken full advantage of it.VIDEOThough its contrast is sharp and bold, the near-perfect digital transfer reveals hitherto-unseen details and textures throughout its range. In nearly every scene there seems to be something new -- from the lace on young Elizabeth's dress, to the braids that hold the beads in the beard of Captain Jack, to the rotting, clinging skin on the pirates' moonlit skulls.The colors, always good, are now simply great. Pure and vivid, they show off every brilliant yellow and orange in the film's Caribbean days; every spooky blue in its moonlight nights. Flesh tones couldn't be better.The transfer has no grain, even in the darkest scenes, and there are no compression artifacts, so even the largest patch of color stays one solid hue. This, in turn, reveals even more minute detail. Have you ever noticed that the redhead's curls match the pattern on her dress? Or that the skeleton monkey has mangy fur? I hadn't, until now.AUDIOAs you would guess, the uncompressed 5.1 soundtrack delivers amazing audio quality, with great imaging between its channels for a full 360-degree field of sound. But what's really cool is, again, all the detail. There's just so much sound here. You hear the wooden ships creak and moan as they sail. You hear individual instruments in the score. You can even make out every word -- well, most every word -- of Captain Jack's often slurred, sun-baked mumble.BONUS FEATURESThe two-disc set contains all the low-res bonuses of the earlier standard release, as well as a nifty new one. Activate ""Scoundrels at Sea"" and, as you watch the movie, a prompt pops up every few minutes that lets you view a short clip about pirate history. You can skip it, watch it immediately, or build up a library of clips to view at the film's end.To sum up, this is the best Blu-ray title out there. It's a great way to experience that big-bucks home theater system, and a treasure trove of entertainment fun."	5.0	The new Blu-ray benchmark	2007-05-21	64	61	3

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"I wonder who at Disney Studios came up with the idea of making movies based on some of their theme park attractions? In my opinion, the idea should have sounded ludicrous, basing a feature length film on a 5-10 minute long ride, impossible. Apparently someone at Disney thought the idea had some merit, though why is beyond me. Especially when the first attempt was the incredibly lame Disney film ""The Country Bears"", it is mind boggling that even after such a failure that some executive still said ok to another movie based on a theme park attraction. But, thank God for that executive that gave the idea the green light, because had they not we never would have been treated to what is absolutely the best pirate movie ever created, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"".""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" centers on a legendary pirate crew that stole a treasure trove of Aztec gold, that unbeknownst to them carried a dark curse. The curse was that if anyone stole the gold and then separated any of the pieces from the rest of the loot then that person would become the undead. In daylight they would look normal and would never know the curse was upon them, but when moonlight shone they would appear in their cursed form. Now, the undead pirates of the Black Pearl are in search of all the gold pieces they had stolen and spent on various items, a search that has led them far and wide. With only one piece left to retrieve they come to a British settlement in search of the final piece that will lift the curse. The regional governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) is in possession of the final piece and is taken when she invokes an ancient pirate code of parlay, which demands that she be taken to the pirate captain for negotiation. However, the negotiation doesn't quite go as planned and Elizabeth becomes prisoner of the undead pirates. With Elizabeth missing, a local blacksmith, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who happens to be in love with her, embarks on a quest to rescue his damsel in distress. To succeed in this endeavor Will must ally himself with that which he hates the most, a pirate. Assisting Will in his endeavor is the pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow (a hilarious Johnny Depp), who just so happens to know where the Black Pearl and its crew of the undead call home. For once upon a time, Jack was the captain of the Black Pearl, until he was overthrown in a mutiny led by his traitorous first mate Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush). Now this unlikely pair of heroes set off on their quest, one who is willing to risk it all for the love of his life and the other who simply wants vengeance and to reclaim what was once his.Though the idea of adapting a theme park ride into a blockbuster movie must have sounded ridiculous (and still does), it's obvious that someone at Disney knew what he or she were doing and the gamble paid off big time. In my opinion the gamble wouldn't have been as successful if not for producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""The Rock"" and ""Con Air""). I wonder if Bruckheimer had any idea just how massive of a hit he had on his hands when he signed on to produce this film, who knows, but the choice was definitely a wise one.All of the actors delivered outstanding performances, especially Johnny Depp (""Sleepy Hollow"") as the outrageous Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom (`Lord of the Rings' trilogy) and Keira Knightley (""King Arthur"") were perfectly cast as the other two leads in the film, lending a more normal tone to the picture to balance out Jack's quirky characteristics. Geoffrey Rush was probably one of the biggest surprises for me as Captain Barbosa, I had never seen him in a blockbuster type of film, but he handled the part with ease. Rush played the traitorous Barbosa with a deliciously evil streak who took great joy in the knowledge that he could not be killed, yet there was a hint of sadness at the thought of an eternity cursed and a yearning to be human again.Assisting the cast, especially the cursed pirates were the visual effects wizards at George Lucas' ILM (Industrial Light and Magic). This group has always done outstanding work on all of their various projects, but the effects they've created here are by far their best ever. The scenes where the cursed pirates switch from human to skeleton form are absolutely flawless, outstanding work from a highly talented organization.With all that being said, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is proof that sometimes a risk, no matter how foolish it may appear to be, can pay off many times over. All you need is an entertaining and solid script, with wonderful acting from the entire cast, and incredibly realistic CGI effects and you may just have yourself a summer blockbuster that audiences will come back to time and time again.""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is rated PG-13 for violence and mild language."	5.0	A Pirate's Life For Me...	2005-07-21	1	1	0

It's Johnny Depp being awesome; with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley standing around being hot with occasional spurts of acting. Geoffrey Rush plays the main antagonist and puts out a great performance.This is one of the coolest adventure films to come out in years. If you like movies like The Mummy and Indiana Jones, or just have an abiding love for kinda corny pirate flicks, then this is right up your alley.As far as the presentation of the DVD, it's clean and the packaging isn't annoying.

Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightly and the rest of the cast are perfect, never striking a false note.  This is an extremely difficult film to do in this day and age, where attention spans are short and action sequences only involve CGI.  But this film manages to combine action, romance, drama, humor and even a touch of the supernatural, bringing back the swashbuckler with the thrill of one-on-one combat.

The writing is amazingly good, and while some of it is cliche, they spun it in a way that made it seem fresh and new.  It was the perfect mix of drama and comedy that has you captivated the entire time you're in the theater.  I liked it so much I went back the next day and saw it again.  I already have the DVD pre-ordered too!  I admit I was disappointed to see that they are making a sequel, knowing Disney they'll screw it up!

I had obviously never seen it, but they saw it twice in theaters and once the DVD came out they had most of the lines memorized.  So, last night, they sat me down and told me to watch it.  Literally it happened as &quot;Oh my God!  This is, like, the best movie ever!  You will, like, love it!&quot;  Keep in mind we are 15 years old haha.  The first 45 minutes weren't that bad, but then it just dragged on and on.  Johnny Depp slurred all of his lines and I could not understand much of what he was saying.  The fight scenes were so long and it was the same thing over and over.  Orlando Bloom, in my opinion, was very boring and lifeless.  Maybe his character was supposed to be that way, but still.  I kept staring at the DVD box when an hour and 30 minutes had gone by, hoping the movie would end soon. I still had another 45 minutes. Eventually, my two friends were so enraptured with the film (and Orlando Bloom) that I let myself fell asleep for the last 20 minutes, something I wanted to do after the first 45 minutes of the movie. As a first time viewer, I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone.	1.0	Very overrated	2003-12-19	32	11	21

Fun.This movie is fun from the beginning to the end, and doesn't pretend to be more than it is.  They could have completely ruined this movie and tried to make it a serious film, but they didn't and it isn't.

Never have these traits been better embodied than in Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp's performance is scintillatingly brilliant! Sparrow may be rum-soaked and sun-baked, but he's ten steps ahead of everyone else. From his grandstand docking to his loving caress of his beloved Black Pearl, this movie allows you to escape in the truest sense of the word!

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1JAZVQ0RD3RAX	Katie	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, was an absolutly awesome movie. If you enjoy fantasy of any sort, action, drama, historical, or romance, this movie is one which you must view this summer. In my opinion, Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley stole the show, and Orlando Bloom was amazing to boot. Depp was the life of the movie- hilarious, sarcastic, and kept the plot from becoming over dragging or boring. Knightley gave the story the impetuous nature that kept the viewers guessing. And Bloom was the reliable factor that kept the movie from getting out of hand, and showed the determined spirit the audience loved.As telling the entire story would completely ruin it, I will only briefly paraphrase the beginning, although it is well explained in the movie. Though the plot twists can be guessed by a canny observer, the action sequences- superb, really- and the spontaneous events spurned by Knightley and Depp made it an enjoyable experience. Knightley and Bloom- the romantic side of the story- met on a passage from England to America. Knightley is the lovely Elizabeth Swann, daughter of a governor. Bloom is Will Turner, one rescued from a ship wreck spotted by the 8 year old Elizabeth. She entertains an intrest in pirates, and when she is given charge of Will by her father, finds a pendent about his neck. Clearly the sign of a pirate, she takes it.Years later- perhaps 8 or more, the exact age is not said- we meet Will and Elizabeth again, with an encounter with Depp, as Captain Jack Sparrow- a pirate. Saving Elizabeth from drowning, Jack is unceremoniously taken by Elizabeth's suitor- reluctant as she is- and sentenced to hanging for his crimes as a pirate. Does he escape?Of course he does. The movie could not happen without Jack. How he does, you must see..but then he is captured again, and held in prison. Then the infamous Black Pearl, a ship uncaught by the Royal British Navy, one crewed and captained by the undead, makes its appearence, searching for a trinket, held by a member of the town in which Elizabeth and Will reside....Elizabeth is taken by the pirates- showing her stubborn, intelligent, and defiant nature when doing so- and is taken aboard the Pearl. Will attempts to save her, but is thwarted by an unplanned nap in the middle of a street. Will obviously has intrests in Elizabeth, and wants to rescue her at all costs. Even with his distaste for pirates, he springs Jack from jail on a promise Jack will lead him to the Black Pearl- which only Jack can do. And so off they set to rescue Elizabeth- and there is your basis for this wondrous movie.I give it 5 stars. The music is wonderful, the special effects amazing, the acting so real you can sense the evil of the Captain Barabossa, played by Geoffrey Rush, who has earned Jack's undying hatred, the clever Elizabeth, the schemes of Jack, and the determination of Will. The only flaw? Hmmm... -Taps chin in thought- Ummm....ahhh....eeerrr....nope, can't think of one. Except that the some of the fight scenes are a bit long winded, but no matter. A terrific movie, fully deserving of the 5 stars. I think I'll go see it again....and again...and again...	5.0	Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse That Awed	2003-07-16	0	0	0

Fullscreen belongs on VHS and if Joe 6 Packs want their Fullscreen, they should buy the VHS version.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3MOW35OXADMNA	Keith L	This movie has sparked quite a lot of controversy, hailed by some critics and assaulted by others. I think this movie is a lot of fun. There are a couple of not-so-good parts, but the rest is a joy to watch.This comic swashbuckler was quite surprising for me. Seeing as it was named after a theme park ride, why watch it? Probably a load of crap from unimaginative screenwriters, right? Wrong.This movie's plot revolves around the cursed pirates of the Black Pearl, doomed to sail the seas til doomsday and never to enjoy drink nor food unless they could break the curse. How to break the curse? Find over 800 pieces of Aztec gold and stain it with the blood of one single man. So let's find us the man and the gold and finish it.The last piece of Aztec gold is held by Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), daughter of the governor of Port Royal. One dark night, she is kidnapped by the Black Pearl's crew and taken to the ship. &quot;What be your name, missis?&quot; asked the captain, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Thinking that if she turned out not to be the governor's daughter, the pirates would leave her, she replies, &quot;Elizabeth... Turner, sir.&quot; She is taken and locked in a room, even as the Black Pearl leaves Port Royal.Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith that loves Elizabeth, decides to try to rescue her. He forms a wary alliance with former pirate captain of the Black Pearl, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who is the only one who knows where to find the Black Pearl. It all goes downhill from there and the laughs increase and increase.Johnny Depp delivers a convincing performance as (&quot;Captain!&quot;) Jack Sparrow. He is the star of the movie, a hilarious pirate who turns out to be a (relatively) good man.This movie is a laugh parade as Jack and Will race against the clock to save Elizabeth and get away from Port Royal navy officials. This is a must-see and I will reveal no more as the movie is truly one to be experienced by one's self.	4.0	Enjoyable movie for people of all ages	2004-04-30	0	0	0

I wonder if thier gonging to make a second one, cause if they do I am so there.My all time favorite part would have to be when Jack and Will are sward fighting in the shop now that is really exciting to watch.  I for sure did not like the ending yuk the kiss, but oh well its part of the movie.  I liked alot of the parts where Will was in them cause what ever part he was in was good(besides the ending).

When I got this DVD I feared the worst but I was wrong. I loved the movie, though it is NOT one for the kids despite being made by Disney. To the people that complain about the violence, by their very nature pirates were far from nice people. The only problem I had was the accents seem to get strangely Australian rather than English by the end. There is also one point where Depp slide down a rope, a little difficult to do when your hands are chained together, he clearly throws the chain over the rope. Aside from that I loved it but then I prefer the darker movies. Buy it but do not buy it for kids! It's the same people complaining that thought taking the kids to see Jurassic Park a good idea...

But Pirates of the Caribbean is a delight from start to finish.  It's epic, it's simple, you cheer the good guys you hiss the bad guys and you end up with a warm feeling in your stomach. And it's not just the rum...It's nice to see Johnny Depp pick up a SAG award for his performance here - he truly is the glue that holds the movie together. He's immensely watchable, with the swaying and the weaving and the fleeting looks of puzzlement that scurry across his face.  Fans of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas might perhaps notice certain similarities with the way he played Raoul Duke in that movie, but perhaps as hedonistic reprobates the characters are closer than they might at first appear.  Geoffrey Rush is also damn good, and Jack Davenport hasn't been this convincing since &quot;This Life&quot; premiered.  Don't worry Hollywood, you can still find Brits to be bad guys after all these years.  Also fantastic is Mackenzie Crook, Gareth from the brilliant BBC series &quot;The Office&quot; (He was the one with the &quot;independent&quot; eye...).  Playing with seamen in the Caribbean must be along way from Slough, but he handles it magnificently and, I have to say, made me quite proud.I thought the plot bounced along rather well, the visuals and the special effects were awesome but not distracting, and I'd recommend the movie to anyone and everyone.The DVD set is also really good, with a whole host of outtakes, deleted scenes, how-did-they-do-that? specials and even a video diary from one of the pirates.Top notch!	5.0	&quot;I probably deserved that...&quot;	2004-03-03	1	1	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1OBJ2263JCK5	Kenneth M. Gelwasser	In the last thirty years any film, that had almost anything to do with 'pirates' could pretty much be labeled as a &quot;bomb&quot; among both critics and movie audiences alike. Couple that fact, with the ideal from the folks at Disney to make movies based on their theme park amusement rides and you have a recipe for a 'High Concept' disaster...right? Well, I hate to admit it, but &quot;Pirates of the &quot;Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; is one Summer, popcorn munching film, that I totally loved!! As the title suggests the story takes place among the 18th century Caribbean islands and the open seas. A somewhat loopey pirate, Capt. Jack Sparrow (a brilliant Johnny Depp) is searching for his former ship,'the Black Pearl' and the evil pirate crew, that now helms it. Now, under the leadership of the villainous, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), the pirates have a problem of their own. Apparently, in the past, they had stolen ancient Aztec gold treasure and now they are &quot;cursed&quot; with a hellish existance of being neither &quot;alive or dead&quot;. The only way to remove the curse is to collect up and return all the treasure, while spilling the blood of a descendant of a now dead crew mate, 'Boots Strap Turner'. They believe this comes in the form of a beautiful young women named Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley), who they have gone to great lengths to kidnap. This convoluted tale sounds like something out of a comic book or bad pulp novel. But does it work? You Betcha!! This is a fast moving story that keeps you constantly guessing and is filled with witty, quotable dialogue (&quot;You better start believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner because... your in one!&quot;). Director, Gore Verbinski has created an immensly enjoyable film. The movie steals all those old pirate cliches from every old Erol Flynn film you've ever seen and somehow turns it into a fresh and exciting piece of action entertainment. It combines adventure, humor, suspense and even a bit of horror. The closest thing I can compare it to is Speilberg's &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film series. Everything is done just right in this movie. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is both ominous and beautiful. The wonderful music score by Klaus Bedelt gives the film an almost majestic feeling, that adds to the adventure. The sword fights and the stunt work are great &quot;show stoppers&quot; and can only be rivaled by the work in Richard Lester's 'Three Musketeer' movies. The special effects are totally eye popping (love those skeleton pirates!) without overwhelming the story. But the thing that really makes this film special is the perfect casting and top notch acting performances. Johnny Depp (in an Oscar nominated performance) really holds this film together with his comical portrayl of Capt. Jack Sparrow. In subsequent interviews he has admitted that he based the character on modern day pirate & rock star, Keith Richards!! Not to be out done, Actor, Geoffrey Rush really chews on the scenery and gives us a great over the top performance as the Black Pearl's evil, Captain Barbossa. He can really scare the boots off you! Finally their is Actress Keira Knightley, who gives a 'star in the making performance' as Elizabeth a 'damsel in distress', who turns out can hold her own against the villainous pirates.I love the spunk and determination, that her character shows. The DVD to this film is crisp & clear in both picture and sound. The two disc set is loaded with tons of extras on the 'making of the film'. If you are in the mood for some plain old fun, film entertainment, then I would highly recommend &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;!	5.0	Aarrggghh! Shiver Me Timbers!

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3P98J5DZ00A75	"Ken Roberts ""social historian"""	I am going to try to dispell some of the misconceptions of the other reviews of this movie.First off, it's fantasy. It's not real. Like so many action adventure movies out there, it's meant purely for entertainment.Second, yes, I DO consider this family entertainment, although maybe some from the younger set might want to shut their eyes during some of the skeletal parts, or when the town is being ravaged by the pirates. All four of my children (from age 3 to 15) watched this and didn't have to turn their heads once.Third - where does this movie drag? I've read several reviews where reviewers claim the movie drags in the middle. Really? I haven't found that to be the case at all. It held my attention throughout, even the necessary dramatic scenes.Fourth - I like epic movies. Give me a Braveheart, a Gods and Generals, or a Lord of the Ring - movies with length and substance that grab and pull you in (lots of drama as well as adventure) over simpleton flicks like virually every Arnold Schwarzenegger (or other movies of his ilk) anytime.It's worth your money and your time if you like adventure movies. Although this one's a bit off center (how can it not be with Johnny Depp? But he gives it that charm that's missing from so many movies similar to this), from the beginning til the end you'll be riveted to your seat.	5.0	A Swashbuckling Adventure	2004-01-03	2	1	1

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	&quot;Pirates&quot; is a fun romp of a film.  It has to be considering it is based on the amusement park ride of the same name.  Johnny Depp does a good job as Captain Jack Sparrow.  He seems to be about one swig of rum away from oblivion throughout the whole film.  Although most folks applaud Depp as the standout performer in this movie, the entire cast is deserving of accolades.  Although most of the characters are pretty stock, it's how they are played that makes this film so wonderful.  The acting is intentionally over-the-top.  Geoffrey Rush plays Barbossa, the greedy, mutiness pirate captain who commandeers the Black Pearl from Depp.  Rush brings something to the character that makes him more appealing than say, a Captain Hook.  The rest of the pirates are just as greedy and just as mutiness, but their stereotypical behaviors are set off by some brilliant acting.  Their are dumb pirates, mean pirates and, of course, one bad monkey.I won't go into a synopsis of the film.  Instead, I want to speak about the overall production and quality of this flick.  The special effects are dead on(no pun intended).  The way the pirates dance in and out of the moonlight, changing from living beings to rotting corpses, is fun to watch.  The battle between the Pearl and the Interceptor is classic, excessive Hollywood fun.  Even the sounds of this film are played to perfection.  This is one of those movies that makes you wish you had surround sound if you are so not blessed.So, if you like fun, bold adventure with just a little silliness, &quot;Pirates&quot; is definitely a fun movie to watch.  It'll have you wanting to go eat at Long John Silver's and scream &quot;Aargh&quot; all the way back home.  A fun, modern pirate movie in the classic pirate movie vein.	4.0	Ahoy, mateys.

Ghost pirates are seeking the one person who can make them human again...and that's how everyone gets thrown together. I should start by saying, I didn't really want to see this movie initially.  A lot of the reviews said this movie was about 40 minutes too long.  I'd disagree on the whole.  But I did just tune out for the duration of Scene 11 (the 2 ships attacking each other)after relentless action, piled ontop of more action, with booming music to amplify the action.  Anyway, the story was unique and the acting was great.  Especially Johnny Depp in another great role and Lord of the Rings co-star, Orlando Bloom (who for some reason reminded me of Joaquin Phoenix in this role).  And newcomer Keira Knightley just completed a year of three hit movies (Bend it like Beckham, Pirates, and recently Love Actually).  She and Orlando really have a lot of potential and Johnny is finally getting the recognition he deserves as a truly versatile and dedicated young actor (a successful gen X-er).  I'd definately recommend this movie.  Not to mention the DVD is LOADED with extras; including commentaries with the cast and writers, deleted scenes, lots of cool featurettes, documentaries, and more.	4.0	Arrr...where's me flesh matey?	2003-12-14	3	3	0

On blu-ray, it's visually stunning (except in some dark areas where the skin color and shadows look a little grainy).  I do not know what is wrong with the audio but it was very very soft and I had to crank up the sound.  So sound-wise, I am dissapointed.  Another thing that really annoyed me was the framing was totally off.  I heard about this issue and thought Disney had fixed the issue.  I jumped on this and the second one because of the Buy 1 Get 1 free.  But as soon as I started watching it, parts of the heads were cut off in some scenes.  It really annoyed me.  Overall: Great video quality, soft audio, great story line, bad transfer.  Hope Disney will fix the issue and exchange it.	3.0	Great Movie, ruined by bad transfer with framing	2007-10-26	11	8	3

The Black Pearl is commanded by the ruthless Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) who kidnaps Ms. Swann and takes her medallion.  However, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is in love with Ms. Swann is attempting to rescue her, but he needs help from someone who knows something about sailing and pirates.  Thus, he seeks help from ex-Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to aid him on the quest to save his love.  Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a modern swashbuckling tale with CGI that makes the adventure a rather amazing experience.  The performances by the many actors in the film, especially from Rush and Depp, enhance the cinematic experience.

The landscape and scenery is absolutely spectacular!  Completely lifelike and breathtaking ocean views.  And who can resist Capt. Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp.  His black eyeliner and the spunky, flirtatious attitude kept my eyes glued and mouth drooping throughout the entire movie.

Keira Knightley did a beautiful job of playing the part for Elizabeth Swan.  She is a wonderfull actor and I can't waiat to see her roles in upcoming blockbusters.

He plays the role to perfection, from the outrageous swagger and exaggerated facial expressions to some really unforgettable lines. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, both promising young actors, are quite good, and Geoffrey Rush seems to be enjoying himself in his role as the Black Pearl's treacherous captain.

Well, let me tell you, my friends:  There is NOTHING disappointing in this movie.  It is pure fun and rollicking adventure with Johnny Depp's piratey antics.  Thankfully, this film makes no attempt to take itself seriously.  It is silly, and that is what makes it so pleasurable to watch.

I like to quote a bunch of the jokes in the movie (they're still funny!), and still laugh about some of the things he did- it's very fun to watch!The plot is interesting- it goes straight from one thing to another, and it's never obvious what's going to happen next.

All I could think is &quot;Oh great, Disney Corp. can't think of anything new to do so they are making films of the rides...Walt must be spinning in his grave!&quot; I grew up in California, and the first time we went to Disneyland was in 1963 or around there, and then we went back about another 6 times. The Pirates of the Carribean Ride was probably my favorite, and I was loathe to see it done badly.This movie was NOT done badly. Johnny Depp was an absolute scream in this movie. I knew he was weird, but I didn't know he was capable of the type of humor he showed in this movie. The movie was actually a bit of a return to some of the old slapstick/one-liner movies of the past that no one seems to be able to do well any more. Every time Depp came on, I laughed until I cried. His mannerisms, his sarcasm, the rolling eyes, etc. made for a great movie to lighten my day. I really needed that. No stupid gross-out movies, no idiots like Adam Sandler whose language has to be a bad word every two sentences in order to garner humor, no SNL people trying to make comebacks. Just a very funny person doing a very funny role.The plot is light, but it doesn't hurt to have Orlando Bloom in there also. He plays the straight man to Depp's funiness, but I agree with my daughters, Bloom is a good-looker (though I prefer his long blonde locks in Lord of the Rings).Actually, I thought the plot was rather interesting. Since our family tree has it's own pirate in it, I know that cursing was rather rampant in those days. The thought that the pirates had to return the stuff they stole in order to regain their human forms, and the major fiascos that occurred in order for those same pirates to be defeated (since they could not die again) made for a pretty interesting plot).But again, Depp was just amazing in this. A thoroughly enjoyable romp with lots of snickers and out-loud laughs. Some great sword fighting also.Karen Sadler	5.0	Hilarious movie with just a shade of a reminder of the ride!	2003-12-27	1	1	0

I am an avid pirate movie fan, so I might be a bit biased.  I will try to keep myself under control.  First I have read quite a few reviews and if you are not into pirates, think that a movie can't be a good movie without blood, gore, or curse words, you will either be shocked by this movie or bored senseless.The special effects were great.  I didn't see any discrepancies of the special effects.  As I said earlier there is not much gore, very little blood, and no curse words (YEAH!!!).  The backgrounds were beautiful; they make me want to travel to the Caribbean.As for the cast, Johnny Depp was amazing.  He really made his character come to life in a very unique way.  He stole all of the scenes he was in.  Orlando Bloom did a great job as the conquering hero.  All of his fans will be swooning in the aisles.  Geoffrey Rush did a wonderful job as the villain.  There were times that he made me just sit back amazed at his character.  Keira Knightley was a good heroine.  She was not too weak, she didn't simper too much, and she was smart and witty enough to make me feel like cheering a couple of times.  The supporting cast is fun.  There are a couple of pirates that definitely give some comic relief.  Plus if you like monkeys there is a rather creepy monkey in this movie that will amuse.Oh, btw, make sure when you watch it you take a look at the end of the credits.  There is some film at the very end.This is a great film for a hot summer day (or any day in my opinion) when you just want to enjoy a FUN movie.  I will be buying this the second it comes out on dvd!	5.0	Great Pirate Movie	2003-07-14	2	2	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A15NOKND77A9I0	"""k_m_kim"""	At first, I had thought this movie was just so-so from the trailers.  After I watched it, I became an instant fanatic.  Printouts from the movie are like wallpaper in my room at the moment.  Seeing it in the theaters 3 or 4 times, I waited for the DVD and as soon as stores opened I bought it, then watched it a total of 29 times thus far. (It would've been about 700 by now if it hadn't been for school and homework) This is a movie you can never tire of and is suitable for all ages.  Captain Jack Sparrow is BY FAR the most stunning character ever brought to life.  Johnny Depp is an amazing actor.  The humor, the wit, the charm...He's got it all.  You can't walk away from this movie without remembering that pirate. Back to the movie, its just awesome.

Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, the pirate we all want to hate but really admire.  Orlando Bloom as Will Turner the son of a pirate who swears he'll never become a pirate yet he longs for adventure.  Then, throw in the pretty girl... Kiera Knightley as Elizabeth.  As far as I'm concerned she loves them both.This one was scary but very exciting.  Loved the undersea creatures. Buy the DVD for Christmas --you won't be disappointed.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AGKPTMTR3UX1R	"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here"""	"It's difficult to imagine that a movie inspired by an amusement park ride could be as good as this is, but it is. Much of the excellence of this film is due to some inspired performances turned in by some very gifted actors.The eccentric Johnny Depp is the sheet anchor of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN as Captain Jack Sparrow, the roguish, charming, unkempt former Master of the ship ""Black Pearl."" Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of the Royal Governor of Jamaica, and teen heartthrob Orlando Bloom plays her love interest, blacksmith-turned-pirate Will Turner. Geoffrey Rush plays mutineer-turned-pirate Captain Barbosa, who is dedicated to recovering the last of a hoard of Aztec treasure that carries a curse upon it.Unfortunately for Elizabeth Swann besides her corset, she is unknowingly wearing the last of the cursed coins as a medallion, making her the target of Barbosa and crew's depredations. Luckily, Captain Jack Sparrow has a score to settle with Barbosa, who'd left him castaway on a deserted island after stealing the ""Black Pearl"". Together with Bloom, he fights to protect Elizabeth and recover his ship. The Aztec treasure at the heart of it all is cursed; the holders of the treasure are damned to eternal unlife: Captain Barbosa and crew are naught more than living skeletons.The very young (17) Knightley is full of spunk, and Bloom's Turner is evolving from a rather stickish boy into a swashbuckling man. But it is Depp who drives this picture with his portrayal of Captain Sparrow, ""a mix of Keith Richards and Pepe LePew."" Depp's love-starved stoner pirate staggers, rolls, swaggers and dances through every scene, giving the viewer a perfectly realized characterization, probably the one that will be the most memorable of his career.PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is helped immeasurably by a classical and archetypal storyline, the fact that is is the first of its genre in many years, it's whimsical sampling of old Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn movies (one scene is lifted straight out of THE CRIMSON PIRATE with Burt Lancaster), and not least of all by truly incredible sets and special effects. No expense has been spared and no detail overlooked. With it's mix of high adventure, comedy, and good old fashioned romance, this movie can't miss. Whether it's two sequels can measure up still remains to be seen as of this writing.The dual-disc Special Edition DVD does suffer from overinclusiveness. In trying to fill the second DVD, Buena Vista Pictures has graced us with some surprisingly boring commentaries by Director Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp, (it sounds as if they are falling asleep), and a host of other features of uneven quality. Far better are the usual ""Making Of"" documentaries and the commentary by Keira Knightley and Jack Davenport (who plays the Commodore, hopelessly in love with Knightley's character). Knightley and Davenport deliver their commentary with genetically English barbed wit.A fun film that will stand the test of time, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN never falls off before the wind."	5.0	A Dollop of Keith Richards and a Dash of Pepe LePew	2006-07-08	8	8	0

I like pirates though, so my family talked me into seeing this movie last Sunday.  As of last night, I have now seen it 4 times!From Sparrow's humorous and unconventional entrance onto the silver screen, until his final scene singing his favorite pirate ditty on his beloved Black Pearl, his performance kept me entranced.  I have never seen a better characterization in movies that I can recall - he IS Jack Sparrow and I can think of no one who could play it better.  His sense of humor, timing, facial expressions, physical gestures - all perfection.  I KNOW this is a Disney flick, I know it's not a 'serious' film (a la the boring Hours or any of those other self-righteous critical favorites)  But for sheer entertainment and outstanding acting, I hope the Hollywood crowd finally makes us all happy and gives this man an Oscar for the most enjoyable movie character many of us have ever seen!  After all, isn't that what Hollywood is supposed to be about - entertainment and 'carrying us away' from it all?Long live ye, Jack Sparrow, the BEST pirate we have ever seen!	5.0	More fun than I've had in years!

But when I actually saw the movie, I got taken aback by the overall quality of the film! The effects were awesome, sword fights very action-packed, and the actors did a mighty fine job. Captain Jack Sparrow,played by Johnny Depp, is a pirate who thinks highly of himself- and while he may not have the best ship in the beginning, he surely takes over something better in the end. Thats because hes so darn good!Orlando Bloom plays William Turner, a blacksmith who is in love with a lovely young lady(played by Knightley) and aids Capt Jack in rescuing her.Overall this film is great--I cant wait for the dvd to come out!	5.0	Best movie this year	2003-09-04	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2RREERBYRT32T	Krista Butler	For the longest time I never had a favorite movie. This movie has quickly become my all-time favorite. I've seen it 6 times in the theater, and will most likely continue to go see it until it comes out December 2nd. It's still in theaters here (which tells you the movie did extremely well). So anyways, the casting was excellent, the music you will never forget! Even the directing, screenwriting, and production were unbelievable! The more times you see this movie the more interesting things you notice.To make a long review significantly shorter, go buy this movie the second it comes out because I can gaurantee it will be sold out the first day! Then you'll have to wait for the next shipment batch to come in, lol!Oh yeah, and they didn't make Norrington out to be a 'selfish-have to get the girl-no matter what-bad guy' which was great!

Vaske	"Okay, maybe I'm going a bit far on the complimenting, but this is just pure fun and entertainment.  There are really no other movies out there that have a character like Jack Sparrow, or are about just good, clean fun.  Star Wars was a bit like that and a lot of the older movies that have been made were too.Okay Acting:  Fabulous, grand, great, cool.  I mean Johnny Depp is amazing, Geoffry Rush is perfect as Barbossa, Keira Knightley is great, and Orlando is passable, BUT its really about Depp's performance.The Directing is good, ya know you don't really need to direct someone like Depp, but the effects are great and the story never lags or anything.  That was one thing that was stupid.  Some critcs complained this was too long.  What?  I would have been content to sit there for three and a half hours watching it.Overall this is a fabulous film, but you might ask:  ""How can this, based on a Disney ride be good?""The answer is, ""When is the last time you had a great time watching a movie?  Not a comedy.  Just a great time at the movies...for the older people(I'm not one of them, missed all the classics right)it would probably be Indiana Jones or Star Wars and thats my point....they don't make movies like this anymore, see it.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A16X61RLY1YJL7	"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid"""	As the lead line says, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; is an enormously fun movie to watch!  I made the mistake of not catching this one when it was in the theaters but have quite happily made up for it with this wonderful DVD.  For those in my age bracket, like myself, this should bring you back to the good old days on ABC and the plethora of wonderful Disney movies that were shown on Sunday evenings.This grandiose movie also brings to mind the wonder and skill of script writers and movie producers who could take a look at a ride at a Disney theme park and come up with such a wonderful script and full scale production such as this highly enjoyable movie.  I believe it was Jerry Bruckheimer that said in one of the special features that Hollywood had moved away from big pirate movies because they became too expensive to make but with the advent of the CGI it became a lot more feasible.  That being said, it's great that they've done so and hopefully we'll see more, great pirate movies down the road, because as a general rule, they're very fun movies to watch.High praise goes to Johnny Depp for his performance in this wonderful film.  We already knew that he had a great range of acting skills to draw from but his rendition of Captain Jack Sparrow is utterly magnificent.  I believe this is the first film I've seen Geoffrey Rush in and he does an outstanding job in this film.  On to Orlando Bloom, where some may have thought his performance in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films might've have been the highlight of his career, think again, his performance in this film is just as outstanding and this incredible young actor can definitely be counted upon to fulfill the lead role in many a film to come!  Keira Knightley, what a beautiful and talented young actress she is, she performs quite well in this film and it will be great to see where she goes from here.Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Gore Verbinski, both of which are responsible for some very influential films in the past; &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; was more or less destined to do well in the theaters and on the DVD sales racks with people such as these leading the way.  The score for the film is outright perfect, bringing one back to the many pirate movies of old yet being updated and greatly enhancing this wonderful film.The Premise:A young girl is on a Royal Navy ship with her father, the Governor of one of the British colonies in the Caribbean when, in the fog, she spots a young boy floating on wreckage in the water.  The sailors soon recover the child from the water and they soon also discover a ship that is in the process of sinking.  As she is looking after the young boy, she discovers a pirate's pendant on him and as she stands up and looks around she sees a torn and tattered ships sailing away...What follows from there is most certainly a wonderful pirate movie that is fun for the whole family to watch!  I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of pirate movies or more succinctly, fans of well written and performed, entertaining movies!  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-19 Deleted and Alternate Scenes-Multiple Audio Commentaries-&quot;An Epic at Sea&quot; The Making of Pirates-&quot;Below Deck&quot; An Interactive History of Pirates-&quot;Fly on the Set&quot; Featurettes-Diary of a Pirate-Diary of a Ship-Producer's Photo Diary with Jerry Bruckheimer-Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color-&quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot; Scene Progression-Image Galleries&amp;Several Enhanced DVD Computer Features that also link you to the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; website for those that just can't get enough of this wonderful movie!	5.0	Pirates of the Caribbean - An absolutely fun movie!	2004-01-15	3	2	1

He is definetly the [bset looking] pirate I've ever seen.  You cannot keep your eyes off him when he is on the screen.  Kiera Knightly plays her character well, too.  It is nice to see that she is not a whimp and can stand her ground while surrounded by pirates.  Orlando Bloom plays the hero, which is many times hard to play because it is sometimes a very limited roll to expand on, but he really does take charge of his roll and does not let the audience down.  This movie is just fun and wonderful.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A33OK2ATVRDGKK	"LaGibson ""mad_pirate_effie"""	Yes, most girls out there originally intended to see this movie because Orlando Bloom is in it. I adored this movie and I will be the first to say that yes, Johnny Depp completely stole the movie. He had all the laughs, he had the best character and he's all around an amazing actor and in my opinion, he deserves an Oscar for his role. The first scene in this movie is my least favorite, I don't like the girl who plays little Elizabeth, I just...I didn't like that scene. The special effects are amazing, yada yada yada. GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW.On the subject of Orlando Bloom, I think it is a bit extreme to say that he brought none of his acting abilities to the movie and that he could have ruined this and that but oh, oh it was Johnny Depp who saved him. Is Johnny a better actor than Orlando? Yes. Easily. But here's my argument on the behalf of Orlando. He is playing the straight man (generally the less glorified role) next to Johnny Depp's comic genius. Johnny is a seasoned actor, he's been doing this for years, and Captain Jack Sparrow is by far the more interesting character. Personally, I think part of the problem was the script...I mean, most of it was great, but I think when they wrote Will's lines, they...made it too sappy, cheesy, whatever. You can't blame Orlando for that. But also, Orlando is trained as a stage actor. He went to Guildhall and has participated in other programs as a THEATRE actor, not a film actor and so many people don't realize that there is a huge difference between them. He went from doing stage acting immediately into film with no transitional training in there. That's why some of his acting is over the top and very staged-looking...because he's a stage actor and hasn't really had any film training. Lord of the Rings wouldn't help with training the subtleties of film because LOTR is a huge-scale fantasy, and thus everything is huge and over the top and otherwordly. Orlando DOES have talent. As an actor and someone who's seen enough good actors as well as bad actors, I can tell you that yes, he does have talent. He'll probably never be Johnny Depp...he may never win an Academy Award or be awarded some Lifetime Achievement Award...but he does have talent and I don't think we've had a decent enough chance to really see him shine. He was good in this movie, not great, but good. Very few people could have held their own next to Johnny Depp, but he did. But no one can steal the show when Johnny Depp's in the same movie.	5.0	Wait a second there bud...	2003-10-04	6	3	3

(A movie which should be released on DVD by the way)  And so I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean with expectations of a story that would be very entertaining, to say the least.  What I got was more than I could have ever expected and with every thought I have of this movie an incredible thrill comes over me that is hard to describe.  It brings back all of the fantasy and wonder that filled my imagination when I was young and commanded my sense of adventure so that I felt like I was along for the ride.  I was completely enraptured with this movie and with the amazing performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2ZVD2FQSTZ7VQ	langleybcguy	When I heard that this was being made, and knowing that it was based on the beloved Disneyland ride, I was skeptical of its success. I never saw it until this year when I was encouraged to get it by a friend. Even when I bought it I was preparing for disappointment despite the recommendations. I could not have been more wrong!The storyline is believable; it is set in the 1700s during the days of the British colonies in the Caribbean. A pirate captain named Sparrow (Depp) has had his ship - the Black Pearl - stolen by another pirate, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). When Sparrow sails into Port Royal, he is incarcerated to await hanging. However, while he is in prison, Barbossa attacks Port Royal and kidnaps the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Knightley). Knowing this, a young man named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) suggests the governor release Sparrow to track down Barbossa & his men. Sparrow & Turner hastily put a crew together to go after the Black Pearl & Elizabeth. What neither one knows is that Barbossa and his crew have been cursed by an Aztec treasure that they stole, and to which Elizabeth is carrying the last missing piece. The curse laid on Barbossa & his men sentences them to eternal life - as the living dead; a ghastly group of skeletons & ghosts walking the decks of the Black Pearl. Until the last piece of treasure is returned - 'and the blood repaid' - Barbossa & his men will remain cursed. The blood to be repaid? Elizabeth's! Sparrow, Turner & their makeshift pirate crew hastily hijack a ship to go after the wily Barbossa & get the Black Pearl - and Elizabeth - back in one piece.This movie deserved Academy Awards for cinematography & score. It also had solid acting, especially Geoffrey Rush & Johnny Depp. Some of the scenes are a bit frightening and may not be suitable for the littlest ones. I still would highly recommend this film - absolutely spectacular!	4.0	Surprisingly....this one is EXCELLENT!	2006-01-25	1	1	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1LRFOQ0SSIBRW	Larry Mease	I think that Johnny Depp has hit upon his best role ever as an actor.  There is never any time in the movie where it gets stale or slows down, a mixture of comedic wit and sarcasm and last but hardly not least, the special effects are stupendous.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone.On the other hand, Geoffrey Rush also plays perhaps the defining role so far in his career.  The makeup, scars and of course, those rotten teeth, really places him in the movie, a pirate captain, cursed for eternity.

It seems they've been trying to make movies of some of their attractions in their theme parks (Country Bears and the upcoming Haunted Mansion).  I was a little wary after Country Bears wasn't all I'd thought it'd be.  Was I wrong?  Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is in search of a vessel to get his beloved Black Pearl back from Captain Barbosa, the man who left him to die on a deserted island years before. Helping Captain Jack in his quest is Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly.  As Captain Barbosa sets out to reverse the curse that has beset him and his crew, Captain Jack is looking to re-capture his Black Pearl and the movie really takes off.  The special effects are excellent and even though it's a Disney film, keep mind of the PG-13 rating.	4.0	ONE OF DISNEY'S FINEST	2003-08-19	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1PNVCXP4DA6P8	Laura	If you've ever been to Disneyworld, you've probably been on the ride Pirates of the Caribbean because this ride is one of the most popular rides in Disneyworld.  And one of the most popular movies out now is based on this ride, The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.  Its twisted plot, excellent actors, and awesome special effects will keep you watching, and then rewind it to watch it again.In the movie, a famous pirate, Jack Sparrow (played by Johnny Depp) travels around trying to get his ship, the Black Pearl, back but he runs into some trouble along the way.  The Black Pearl has been taken over by some haunted pirates, who are stuck between the living and the dead.  They need to collect all of the blood of the pirates and the Aztec gold coins to break their curse.  Elizabeth Swann (played by Kiera Knightley) is the owner of this last coin; she took it from William Turner when they rescued him from the ocean when they were only children.  The pirates have come to invade Elizabeth's town, and captured her to get the coin back.  Will and Jack team up with Jacks inexperienced crew, to rescue her and the ship.  They have to find the ship and battle against the pirates to get the ship back and save Elizabeth.  Will they succeed?The actors in the movie do a great job of depicting their characters.  Johnny Depp does an excellent job of depicting his character, acting as a drunken pirate throughout the movie.  He definitely does a good job in adding some humor to this action movie.  Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly also do a great job acting in the movie also.  Orlando has some awesome fighting scenes with swords, and skilled maneuvering.  All the actors in this movie seem so real, like they were living in the same era as the pirates were.The special effects and costumes were part of the reason why the movie was such a hit.  Johnny Depp looked like a real pirate because of his great costumes, hair, and makeup throughout the movie.  Also, Kiera Knighltey and Orland Bloom had interesting costumes to make them look like they were really in that era.  Besides the costume and makeup, the special effects is another reason why this movie was so realistic and made it such a big hit.  There are a lot of computerized effects in this movie, like the pirates that look like skeletons, or some of the fight scenes that were computerized.  There are so much unrealistic things in this movie that get your attention and make this movie a fun movie to watch.This, in my opinion, is one of the greatest movies of the whole year.  I loved watching it because it caught my attention throughout the whole movie.  The movie had many famous actors in it, like Johhny Depp, Kiera Knightley, and Orlando Bloom.  Johhny Depp was a great actor throughout the whole movie, and I couldn't get over how realistic he seemed.  He was like a real pirate, without a care in the world.  I also loved the special effects, its part of what keeps your attention to the movie.  If you're in for an action packed movie, with a comedic flair to it, I suggest that you go see Pirates of the Caribbean.  Your eyes will be glued to the screen the whole time.	5.0	Pirates of the Caribean	2004-10-11	1	0	1

Orlando Bloom was just as talented with his swordfighting skills and pure emotion in every single line. Keira Knightley is an extraordinary actress who lit up the screen with her astonishing talent.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	Even before &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; began one of the previews was for &quot;The Haunted Mansion,&quot; which clearly indicates that Disney will be making feature length movies on every one of the rides at Disneyland and Disneyworld (Last year's film &quot;The Country Bears&quot; was clearly just the opening salvo).  However, it will be interesting to see if Disney comes up with a better film from this font of inspiration than this one.  I would be willing to bet big money they will not come up with a longer one.Once upon a time a young girl sailing on a ship to a Caribbean island where her father will be governor spots a young boy on the raft.  Apparently he was on a ship attacked by pirates and while he is unconscious the young girl takes from around his neck a golden medallion.  The next thing we know, both the girl, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) and the boy, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), are all grown up, clearly taken with each other, but separated by their different stations in life.  However, Elizabeth still has that medallion and adventure awaits them, specifically in the form of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a real live pirate.The adjective is important here because Jack has returned from being marooned on an island after his crew on &quot;The Black Pearl&quot; mutinied against him.  After they parted ways the ship and its crew fell under a curse, which is why it is now a ship of ghosts (as opposed to a ghost ship).  Jack, Will, and Elizabeth proceed to have a series of swashbuckling adventures and they match both swords and wits with Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and the pirates of &quot;The Black Pearl.&quot;&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; is a lot of fun for the most part and you can tell what members of the audience have been on the theme park ride because there are bursts of laughter when scenes from the ride (e.g., a group of pirates in a jail cell trying to entice a dog with the key in its mouth to come close enough for them to grab it).  The film provides both humor and action, often at the same times.  The cursed pirates appear as skeletons under the moonlight and the film takes advantage of this during a couple of battle scenes as characters morph back and forth between forms.  I also realized while watching &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; that there is a growing tradition of great sword fighting scenes between people who are not going to kill each other but become friends (e.g., &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot;), to which we can add the scene here between Jack and Will in the blacksmith's shop.This movie runs 134 minutes, which ends up being too long, especially since the happy ending comes about as a result of quick contrivances rather than a truly spectacular finale.  Rush is an old hand at milking a role for everything it is worth, but Depp proves himself to be equally adept (older viewers will have to decide if he is doing some sort of weird little homage to Marlon Brando's Fletcher Christian).  Bloom is not quite as good with a sword as he is with a bow, but that is to be expected, and Knightly is the plucky heroine who ends up rescuing the boys more often than they rescue her.  The result is fun and pretty good fun at that.  At least we know that Gore Verbinski is not going to be offering us a director's cut of this film because there cannot be anything left on the cutting room floor.	4.0	A lot more fun than a ride at Disneyworld, that is for sure	2003-07-20	8	6	2

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1L43KWWR05PCS	Lawyeraau	I originally went to see this film most reluctantly. In fact, the only reason I went to see it at all was because my sister wanted to see it, and it was her birthday. So, how could I not? Well, am I ever glad I did! It was a most enjoyable experience. While the film is long, running nearly two and a half hours, it did not seem so, as it is a fun filled, action packed delight that is sure to entertain people of all ages.The story revolves around pirates with Johnny Depp in the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. He is a pirate who has lost his ship, The Black Pearl, to his arch enemy, the wily Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who led a mutiny against Sparrow. Unfortunately for Captain Barbossa, he and the mutineering crew commandeered some valuable booty that carried with it a curse that turned the ship and all aboard into a ghost ship, damned for all eternity, unless the booty is returned in its entirety to its rightful place. Therein, lies the tale.Captain Sparrow, desperate to recover his ship, ends up on an island where his antics bring him in contact with the Governor's beautiful daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), and the local blacksmith, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who is in love with the delectable Ms. Swan. Before you know it, they all end up together in a rollicking adventure on the high seas.Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley turn in smart, top of the line performances, as does Jonathan Pryce, as the island Governor. Orlando Bloom also gives an excellent performance, though I found him decidedly unattractive in this film, thin lipped and sallow. It is Johnny Depp, however, who steals the show, a drolly funny and totally delightful scamp. Notwithstanding the fact that he has the best lines, Depp infuses the film with an infectiousness that is hard to resist. He literally makes the film.The special effects are spectacular and the film provides fun for the whole family, though given the special effects, it is probably wise to leave those who are five and under at home. Everyone else is sure to enjoy this fun filled, fast paced film. It has something for everyone with just enough action, romance, and humor to keep viewers entertained.	4.0	YO HO HO AND A BOTTLE OF RUM...	2006-06-03	0	0	0

I had very high hopes because of the actors involved, but this movie has no character development, no clarity of plot -- it is merely an action movie, that's it.  Two hours of fighting.  And if you want that, there are plenty of other movies you can watch that are far superior to this one.  Also -- what was Johnny Depp THINKING?  He slurs his words so much in this film that I couldn't understand most of them!  This movie was just plain SAD.

The crew of the Black Pearl has been cursed and each memeber of the crew turns into a skeletal type figure during the full moon. This was due to their stealing the gold coins of Cortes. To escape this curse they must return all the Cortes gold coins that they stole together with the drop of blood of an ex crew member, Bootsrap Bill Turner. However, Bill Turner is now dead and Captain Barbossa must find his child.Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is found by the Royal Navy with one of coins strapped around his neck. The Governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) takes the coin from Will thinking that he's a pirate, so that he is not arrested. Elizabeth keeps the coins for 8 years, until one day she is kidnapped by Captain Barbossa. Will Turner who is now a blacksmith and in love with Elizabeth hires Captain Jack Sparrow to find Elizabeth and they commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy and set sail to find Elizabeth.This was a fun film to watch with lots of swashbuckling sword fights and chases. The plot keeps the film ticking along at a fast pace. The actors are brilliant especially Johnny Depp whose character is larger than life. I did find his &quot;Keith Richards&quot; accent a bit annoying and it sounded too modern for the film. The scenery of the high seas and the great sailing boats are impressive. The special effect creating the skeletal like figures are very real and you can imagine them fighting the Royal Navy. An action adventure packed film highly recommended.Lealing	5.0	Swashbuckling adventure	2004-05-25	0	0	0

I've seen the movie 5 times and there is 4 weeks untill the DVD comes out..I'm very excited.Johnny Depp. He was absolutley amazing, I really admire him as an actor even more than I did before. He was absolutley hilarious. Orlando Bloom was very good too, I suppose. But I'm not one of those teenage girls who scream every time I hear the words Orlando Bloom. Geofferey Rush is stunning as Barbossa- he has had a very good movie year- both Finding Nemo and Pirates.Keira Knightley was very good too, and I've seen more of her films and she is now one of my favorite actresses.The characters are brilliant, ranging from the scene stealing-devishlyhandsome-funny Captain Jack Sparrow, to the uptight Commodore Norrington. The special effects are amazing, and I would not be surprised to see Pirates get nominated for an award in that area- as well as acting and everything else.This was an amazing movie and if you haven't seen it yet, unfortunatley it's just gone out of theatres in my town. But it's coming out on DVD in 4 weeks, 4 days! (I'm counting.)	5.0	Best movie of all time. Period.	2003-10-31	5	5	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1N643TZ48RPG7	Leonard Snerdley	As pirate movies go,I suppose &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; is a quality movie.  I'm certainly no expert on that.  However, I am an expert on &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;, the ride at Disney Land.  Usually, I will ride it 6-7 times when I'm visiting the park.  So, you can understand how I was more than a little excited that my favorite ride was becoming a movie.Sadly, what I got was little more than a meager bone thrown my way.  Director Gore Vidal has taken a stunning experience, and added useless new characters and plot, showing situations that were never in the original ride.  What's more, the classic &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; song is hardly heard at all here.  It's heard throughout the ENTIRE ride, Gore.If you're in the mood for a pirate movie, I guess this is the place to come (although don't overlook the underrated &quot;Pirate Movie&quot; from the early 80s).  If you're looking for the ride captured on film, better just save your money and buy a ticket to Disney Land.  (or World)	2.0	Slightly disappointed	2004-07-15	4	1	3

Johnny Depp took a character and made him unforgettable. a lot of people thought this was going to be a serious movie, but it wasn't. sure, it had it's serious parts, but it was also a comedy, romance, action/adventure mixed with a little bit of horror. if you haven't seen this film i beg you to see it. it's like a redifined Arrol Flynn movie.	5.0	one of the best films of the year	2003-11-26	1	1	0

While they were interesting, I expected more. LOTR spoiled me!  It would have been great to get Johnny Depp's perspective on his character and how he got involved in the project in the first place, and there wasn't much on Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightly either. As for the deleted scenes, some of them should have been in the movie - it would have helped to explain things more. It would also have been interesting to find out how the story came together from a writers perspective. I don't think they expected this movie to be such a success!

I have read reviews from film critics and quite frankly I don't think they know what they are talking about. Pirates of the Caribbean is by far much better than any rating the critics gave. Johnny Depp is right on target as Captain Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner (who was also fantastic in Lord of the Rings by the way). I have already seen Pirates 5 times and would love to see it again. I have also purchased the soundtrack. The music for this movie is so awesome.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A28NL0CPL3FRFB	Linda Borland	Johnny Dep was wonderful, as always, in his crazy, off-beat, unpredictable way.  He saves a film that has little else to offer except special effects and memorable references to the ride.  I must say that Jeffrey Rush also does a marvelous acting job.  However, the plot has lots of holes that make the film poorly conceived.  Captain Jack Sparrow looks far too young to have ever led this aged crew.  He would have been a boy, the same as Will Turner at the time the gold was stolen, so how could he have been the captain.  Also being in Davey Jones Locker wouldn't have ended the life of Turner's father who was as immortally damned as the others, and why was his blood necessary anyway? Couldn't have been part of the Aztec curse, he wasn't around then.  I kept expecting him to show up and throw a new twist into the plot, but he never did.  I thought the love triangle at the base of the storyline was rather pathetic and contrived.  It would have been much more interesting with Depp as the rival suitor (good boy VS the rogue ala Luke Skywalker, Hans Solo, Princess Leah), but then this is Disney and everything has to be totally predictable from the start.	3.0	A little thin on plot, but great special effects.	2003-07-14	11	1	10

The film is stunning, and from the hilarious affability and antics of Captain Jack Sparrow (excellently portrayed by Johnny Depp), to the mysterious Black Pearl, to the shocking curse that hangs over it's doomed crew, it's definitely a pleasing adventure that both teenagers and adults will enjoy.

I decided I would see it only because of Johnny Depp. It was honestly the BEST action/comedy/pirate movie I have seen in a while. Johnny Depp is absolutey fabulous as Captain Jack Sparrow, and Orlando Bloom is equally great as Will Turner. Geoffrey Rush also played a wonderful Captain Barbosa. I'd have to say though, Johnny Depp carried the movie! He was hilarious with his crazy body movements, great facial expressions, and his acting - which is phenomenal as always.AND - even as a pirate with long braided hair and gold capped teeth he is SO gorgeous!

One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! Its about a Pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) Barboosa (Geoffrey Rush)The movie starts out showing Elizibeth Swan and Will Turner as younge chrildren then is shows them as adults, and Elizebth falls off a balcony and Jack sparrows come to the rescue, but they find out he is a pirate and are going to hang him, so he exscapes but is captured again and put in prison. And the Pirates come in on there ship The Black Pearl, and Kiddnap Elizabeth thinking she is the daugther of Capt Bootstraps Turner, they kidnaped her b/c the need the blood of a Turner to cure the curse put upon them.... A curse that in the moonlight They turn to skelatons. But Will Turner sees them take her and frees Jack Sparrows from the prison without permission of the guards and makes a deal w/ him to lead him to the Black Pearl. They finally reach the Black Pearl And The Pirates find out that Elizabeth is not a Turner, so Will Turner makes a deal w/ the Pirates that he lets go Elizabeth and Jack and he will not shoot himself (Knowing They need his blood and if he is killed the curse will remain forever W/ there not being another Turner) So they free Jack and Elizabeth on a deserted Island. Jack and Elizabeth are rescued. And they go after Will. They find him and then Jack reveals a secret.... (That the curse is on him too.) So the Pirates nor Jack Sparrows can be killed, then there is a fight seen and Will cuts himself and puts his blood on a coin and so the curse is broken and Barboosa is killed. Then they return home and Capt. Jack Sparrows is to be hung... Do you think he can get out of this one? Well you'll just have to see the movie and find out.... All in all this is a great movie. You must see it, I thought it was going to be a stuped movie and didn't want to see it except every one kept telling be it was a good movie, so I seen it and now it is one of my favorite movies! :)	5.0	Go see the Pirates!	2003-10-12	8	1	7

The cast is superb.  Johnny Depp is hilarious as the over-the-top rouge pirate, Jack Sparrow.  Orlando Bloom, probably cast for the ladies ;-), is very handsome and makes a great blacksmith-turned-pirate, Will Turner.  Newcomer Keira Knightney is a beautiful and talented girl (only 17 years old at the time of shooting) who will go far in her career.  Her protrayal of governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann was wonderfully fiesty underneath her upright exterior.  Geoffrey Rush was delightfully frightening as evil pirate Captain Barbossa.  This movie had wonderful visual effects, the best being during a swordfight in a moonlit cave.

They showed parts of the actual ride in the film so all of us could relate. I liked the creative touch of making the pirates into ghosts under a curse. This was a really good movie, the plot was easy to follow but the director made this into an extravangaza. He also directed The Ring, and made that movie into a real scary treat.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3NZVCL9N8CLHB	"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True"""	Pirates of the Caribean was not a movie I was really dying to see. Being Im not an 8 yr old girl, I wasnt very interested in anything produced by disney, I was much more interested in seeing Terminator 3, The Hulk, or one of many dramas that were out at the time. I ended up seeing it at the theater however due to my girlfriend's persistence. As it turned out the movie was nothing like I expected it to be, and I really enjoyed it.The movie is loosley based (inspired would be a better word) around the ride that bears the same name at disney land. The time frame for the movie is nicely depicted throughout as being authentic enough to not cause any noticable historical inacuracies. The historical setting however is really just a convenient backdrop to tell an adventure story based on pirates. johnny Depp is the star, and does a pretty good job playing his role as a good guy pirate. Of course there is plenty of reference to treasure, ghost stories, and other good stuff.The movie successfully combines various levels of enjoyment into one cohesive experience suitable for the whole family. Part ghost story, part adventure movie, part fairy tale, and part comedy - this one really does have something to apeal to almost anyone in one way or another. The director succeeded in keeping a light hearted note throughout the movie while adding in some slightly darker elements. I actually believe the moive was the first disney movie to get a PG13 rating, though it's completely harmless in my oppinion. It reminds me much of the indiana jones trilogy (whick actually INVENTED PG13, as temple of doom was considered too &quot;dark&quot; to get a PG rating, but not close to warranting an R rating). The goal was obviously to apeal to both kids, teens, and parents a like and create something that everyone could enjoy.The blending of action/adventure and humor is superb and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments. The action sequences are also well done and the special effects are top notch. This movie has a little of everything, and really is an excelent experience from begining to end. It's mature enough for adults to thuroughly enjoy, but it's suitable enough for even the youngest kids in my oppinion.All in all, Pirates of the Caribean was one of the biggest surprises I've had at the movies in a long time. I never enjoyed a movie i thought I was going to hate so much. If you're loking for an upbeat, adventure movie with lots of humour that somehow manages not to cross the &quot;stupidly silly&quot; line, this is it. I would call it the &quot;Indiana Jones of the year 2003&quot;.	5.0	Shiver me timbers	2004-01-11	2	2	0

Johnny Depp is a somewhat less dashing and romantic figure than Errol Flynn, but he plays a pirate with a wonderful flair for style, humor and a touch of drama. Orlando Bloom as Will Turner takes the romantic lead, primarily with beautiful Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce).We are quickly introduced to Captain Jack Sparrow, a notorious pirate. We also quickly learn that Captain Jack must be one of the luckiest men alive as he escapes from one catastrophe after another. We soon encounter Will Turner and learn that he has been making swords and practicing with them for three hours a day. Of course, we saw him in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and we can attest to his apparent excellence with blades of steel. We also meet Elizabeth Swann early in this movie, and what a beautiful woman she is, perfect for being a central character from the beginning of this movie to the end.The last central character we meet is the pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). We soon learn that Barbossa and the crew of the pirate ship Black Pearl have been cursed; a curse which can only be broken by gathering together of a chest of gold and spilling the blood of a certain person. Since the time of the curse Barbossa has been seeking a single piece of gold and a relative of a man named Turner.The action continues briskly from the beginning to the end, with the often bumbling pirates seeming to keep the upper hand from the beginning to nearly the end of the movie. Of course, once we learn that the pirates are dead we understand better that they can not be defeated. I leave the end for the viewer to discover.This movie is based loosely on the Disney ride. There are scenes in the movie that are based on scenes from the ride. Those scenes tend to be some of the funnier scenes. However, other than being inspired by the ride and having a few scenes based on the ride, the movie departs quite far from the ride itself, and the departure is all to the good.There have been a few attempts at making swashbuckler movies in the last several decades. A few have done reasonably well. However, this movie is a nice throwback to the eras of Errol Flynn and Burt Lancaster. There are quite a number of nice stunts, and the ships are beautiful. The movie contains a number of moderately scary moments, and the violence is pervasive, so the PG-13 rating is justified, and should probably cause parents to consider what age should be permitted to watch this movie. However, for fans of action movies and pirate swashbucklers in general, this one is a winner."	5.0	Yo, ho, ho and a Bottle of Rum!	2005-06-19	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1TX18RM7CJRUV	"Lord Frugal ""Lord Frugal"""	"I'll have to admit that I'm substance over style when it comes to movies.  In fact, I didn't even hesitate refusing this one in theaters for two reasons:1) It's a Disney flick, so there's always the threat of syrupy goodness through morals, bubbly yet not funny gags (which were prevalent in the previews that also made the movie seem a bit unoriginal), and characters who have a better chance of being remembered by infants, who have imaginations so vivid that poor CGI and a weak story is a stroke of genius(if you take into account Disney's other works that came out around this time, then you'd know that this reason is true, except Pixar, b-cuz those movies are Pixar productions through Disney distribution and therefore don't count).2)Actors starring in POTC provoked suspicion: Johnny Depp= chick magnet/acceptable by males b-cuz they most likely haven't watched that teen-soap he starred in, but has seen his other performances that has earned him a cool actor pass (the coolness right below Deniro, Pacino, Hopkins, etc...) Orlando Bloom= chick magnet/unacceptable by males because he really hasn't paid any dues as far as showing any real talent and is only in this movie because he's a chick magnet before being a 1/3rd decent actor.So I guess it's fair to say that my reasons are only from the outside looking in rather than looking into it and judging when I get outside.It wasn't until I stumbled upon it while my relentlessly renting father rented a bunch of new movies and I caught him watching it.  After watching it halfway through to the end, then watching from the beginning to the end, then watching it all over again, I realized I was almost a closed-minded fool.  I won't be rushing to the next Johnny Depp/Orlando Bloom colaboration or anything, but if they're recurring the roles for another POTC, then I'm definitely down for it! This movie was a good peice of work.  Screw the fact that this was ""historically inaccurate and that pirates raped, killed, and stood as a symbol of selfishness"" (which, in fact, isn't really historically accurate to all pirates, but that's another discussion)...this was a highly entertaining movie.  It's an adventure as big as Indiana Jones with lush environments, situational action sequences and gags that are inventive, and small intriguing plot twists that both make sense and save a character at the same time. If that's not enough, Geoffrey Rush (probably the only reason I would see the movie, but wasn't enough to make me risk a night of debauchery to watch it) is the antagonist who retains that brash arrogance yet animalistic flair that makes him cool to watch.  Orlando Bloom, while a chick magnet, is likeable in that he is treated like a newbie (synonymous with my statement of his acting experience) and is hazed, or punked, pretty regularly by Depp, who (here's the interesting part) uses a coherent variation of his character in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which is infectious and captivating to the point where you forget about who plays the character and you instantly think he's a good antihero.  It's also at a good length.  I've always considered good movies at 120 minutes +, a decent expenditure. So yes, this movie is worth buying as long as you can accept that it's meant to be an excerise in entertaining everyone, then even the most hardcore of masculine movie-buffs will enjoy this as a guilty pleasure.  I gave it four stars because, like I said, it attempts and succeeds to entertain everybody. So there is love and hope and rare sappy one-liners that are sooo not the reason why I enjoyed it that I'm sure any self-respecting man would be hesitant to suggest it as a viable selection to those among his brethren who haven't seen it without proving that he's borderline gay."	4.0	Review for Males: Highly Entertaining...that's what you want, right?	2006-07-10	8	1	7

The story and script are clever, the special effects are creative and convincing, and the scenery and atmosphere are spectacular. And let's not forget the actors!! Johnny Depp, as Captain Jack Sparrow, (almost) steals the movie with one the most bizarre and original characters in movie history!! I smiled every time he walked on screen! Geoffrey Rush was wonderfully evil as the villain; Orlando Bloom suitably dashing as the noble hero of humble origins; and Keira Knightley was great as the energetic and independent Elizabeth Swann. In a side note, I will confess that I think Keira Knightley is one of the most mesmerizing and heart-breakingly beautiful women I have EVER seen!!!

Quido ""quidrock"""	"What might have otherwise been an above average Disney film is made into a 5 star effort by the performance given by Johnny Depp, as Jack Sparrow - pirate captain and general scalawag.  By virtue of his performance, Depp makes everyone else in the movie play to him, enhancing their own roles.  Geoffrey Rush shines (again!) as his arch-enemy, who mutinied against Sparrow and took his ship.Sparrow aligns himself with a mismatched young couple (Knightley and Bloom) and leads them into pirate adventure.  Depp's makeup and costume, and his affectations draw the camera like a magnet.  Disney added wondrous locations, beautiful props and costumes and a soaring, perfectly matched musical score.  The ""cameo shots"" from Disney's theme park ride are a nice bit of whimsy...Without a doubt the most entertaining movie of the summer, ""Pirates"" is first-rate.  Depp will deserve nominations from all the major awards shows, but is unlikely to be recognized.  Like Jack Nicholson, however, he remains truly one of our greatest character actors, and his memory will remain long after others' Oscars have tarnished.Don't postpone seeing it until the DVD!

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1O8J5VBMPG098	Luke Edwards	"When writing the play THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE in 1879, English playwright W.S. Gilbert wrote the words ""It is, it is a glorious thing, to be a Pirate King."" And if these words have any grain of truth whatsoever, then Johnny Depp would own the whole beach. The throne of Pirate King is rightfully his, as far as I'm concerned. The crown fits him well. In fact, if it were down to me, I wouldn't think twice about giving him an Oscar for his totally mesmerizing performance in this film.For one thing, the true sign of a good actor is versatility. And Johnny Depp is definitely one of the most versatile performers Hollywood has seen since the Golden Era, if not THE most. For every role he plays, he brings something completely new to the character. He changes his voice. He changes his appearance. The way he walks, moves... his every mannerism and facial expression are altered to fit whatever character he's playing. In ED WOOD he delightfully and hilariously parodied the atypical 1950s film star. In FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS he showed us how good he is at observing human behavior and imitating it by impersonating gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. And in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (based on a popular theme-park ride at Disneyland) he dazzles us with his performance as Capt. Jack Sparrow - a despicable, sleazy, drunken pirate who speaks in slurred, confused incomprehensibles but inevitably wins us over with his roguish charm.The story is simple: basically, there's this gold medallion. It's clearly a pirate thing. And it's currently in the hands of the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) who lives on a British military installation called Fort Royal, a picturesque little island slap-bang in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. But the medallion isn't hers. It actually used to belong to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a young boy who was found floating on the surface of the ocean during Elizabeth's transatlantic journey to the island eight years ago. When his unconscious body was dragged aboard the ship, the 12-year-old Elizabeth found the gold medallion fastened round his neck and, fearing for his life, she took it from him and kept it for herself.Since then, Will has grown up into a dashing young blacksmith (sporting a little Errol Flynn-style moustache) and he makes lots of swords for a living (""You need to get yourself a girl, mate!""). It becomes obvious that both Will and Elizabeth are romantically interested in each other. But there's a big social divide between them so we know for a fact they're not gonna get together. (Yeah... right!). It's at this moment that Johnny arrives on the scene. Or, if you prefer, Capt. Jack Sparrow does. With a mane of greasy dreadlocks and a goatie with multi-colored beads braided to it, you know there's going to be trouble. And you'd be right. It's not long before Jack is arrested and thrown behind bars. Some pirate, huh? Then, that very night, Fort Royal is attacked by a ship with black sails called The Black Pearl, and Elizabeth is kidnapped for being in possession of the gold medallion. Her unreqieted lover Will is now forced to take action. Knowing that Captain Jack Sparrow is privy to knowledge of all that is piracy, Will helps him break free from jail on the condition that he aid him on his quest to find The Black Pearl and save his beloved Elizabeth.Believe me, there is a lot more to it than that. I mean, did I even mention the fact that the The Black Pearl is crewed by a bunch of immortal pirates who turn into skeletons when the moonlight hits them? Or that Jack's sworn enemy, Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), stole the ship off Jack ages ago and abandoned him on a desert island with only a pistol and a bottle of rum for company? And did I let slip that the reason they need the gold medallion (which is one of many Aztec coins, incidentally) is to undo the curse of immortality that was wrought upon them by the heathen gods? No, I didn't tell you any of those things. I suppose you'll just have to watch the damn movie and find it all out for yourself.The film is not without flaws, however. Location-wise, the story tends to jump around a little too much, and at 2 hours 23 minutes long it does tend to drag on its hind legs a bit. But the action sequences are spectactularly explosive (as you'd expect from a movie produced by action movie maestro Jerry Bruckheimer), Gore Verbinski's direction is crisp and efficient, and the script written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (SHREK, THE MASK OF ZORRO) is sharp, exciting and funny (if occasionally clich&eacute;d). By the way, if there's anyone who wants to look deeply into this film (as I tend to do), take note of the mythical undercurrent with the references to Hernan Cortes (a real-life Spanish explorer who was mistaken for a god by the Aztecs). Historically, the cursed treasure idea kinda makes sense. And by including these supernatural elements in a pirate movie, they have succeeded in doing something very new and highly original. So I applaud them for that.I really enjoyed this movie. It has restored my faith in the Hollywood blockbuster after far too many disappointments. But it only gets 4 stars because there are a number of holes in the plot that could have been embellished upon. Such as: Why was Bootstrap Bill's blood so important? Why him, of all people? Still, I can't deny this is ripping entertainment. And very fun to watch. I'll recommend it to anyone. And I truly believe that Johnny Depp steals every single frame. To be fair, this is HIS movie. His performance is a real stroke of genius. So if you're seeing this movie for the very first time, you're in for a real treat. Don't miss out."	4.0	ARISE, SIR JOHNNY, THE PIRATE KING!	2004-02-08	1	1	0

His character, Jack Sparrow, is a funny down on his luck pirate preceeded by legends of his life that are mostly untrue. He does seem a bit....off from his past adventures, but it only adds to the hilarity of the movie.Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner, the aprentice to the blacksmith. Will was found in the middle of the ocean as a child by Miss Swan as he calls her.

The special FX are great, Johnny Depp is WONDERFUL and the storyline is pretty good.  At points in the movie (Sparrow in the bar convincing the older pirate that Turner is indeed a treasure) were a little stiff.  It seemed as if the plotline took a backseat to the FX and to the characters themselves.  Depp, as Captain Jack Sparrow, is quirky and eccentric and the antithesis of the classic pirate.  He blows a breath of fresh air into this movie.  Orlando Bloom is totally believable as a slightly uptight orphan.  Keira Knightley is fun, fun, fun as an adventure-starved lady of the manor.

A lesser actor would have failed totally and Jack Sparrow would have been just a cartoon character.Both Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush seemed to be having great fun with their roles: Geoffrey Rush looked very much at home in his part of the wily and evil Capt'n Barbossa - the man must have salt water in his blood. As a result, the two ""straight parts"" of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley seemed a bit bland in comparison.The action starts revving up right from the first few minutes and keeps growing. My only criticism is that the fight at the end was maybe a little too long, but that's only a small point. It's one of the few films I've gone to see two days in a row.The special effects are great without overshadowing the story  and the whole film gives the long-neglected genre of pirate movies a good name once again.Just stick me on a desert island with Captain Sparrow and I'll be quite happy, thank you very much!"	5.0	I'd share a bottle of rum any time, Capt Sparrow!	2003-11-26	3	3	0

Let's face it, we were going to see Orlando Bloom (aka Legalos) and the movie is based on an amusement park ride; how much story could there be?  Well, let me tell you, I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised if I'd won free tickets to DisneyWorld itself!  It is a wonderful story, filled with the Disney comedy we've come to expect and love.  The acting was good.  It was all the way around a great family flick.  Now if you have younger children, you might consider waiting a year or two.  Of course, being pirates, they raid and burn towns so thats a little violent.  And the pirates can be alittle unsettling.  But if you have boys like mine who thrive on sword play, you'll love it. Not mention a girl who enjoys Orlando (big sigh!).

It's gripping, interesting, funny, scary, has great fighting, great acting and some of the most flawless CGI FX anyone has ever see- so why three stars out of five? Simply because I doomed myself. I hate this movie now, the only thing that keeps me from giving it one star is the memory of how delightful it really is. Why can't I stand it when I used to adore it you ask? It's easy, it happens to everybody one day or another: You have a movie you can't get enough of, you watch it so many times that soon you've memorized the movie- but you just keep watching it anyway! Soon you become tired of it and while everyone else is still in love with it you can't bear the mere mention of it.

Though the beautiful Keira Knightley (Bend It Like Beckham) and Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) play very good parts, alongside Geoffrey Rush, this is a movie that Depp steals from the moment he appears on it.Though I enjoyed his performances in ""Blow,"" ""Chocolat,"" ""Before Night Falls"" and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" his impersonation of Captain Jack Sparrow was simply brilliant and deeply enjoyable all the way. With a very intentional and sometimes unintelligible accent that makes him sound like a drunk Australian with twist, Depp's brilliance resides in his infusion of Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards' traits into his character, something that will make you laugh every single time he even moves. In fact, at times he doesn't even have to talk to deliver: his character transmits a mix of madness, recklessness, goofyness and sense of adventure through all means that he has at hand.Five stars to a great performance and one of the most entertaining movies of the summer to now come out on DVD just in time for the Holidays."	5.0	Johnny Depp is too much: he IS the movie	2003-12-01	3	2	1

Lots of flair, sword fights, big ships, special effects, costumes, the works. Makes for great disney rides.However, although all these movies have amazing entertainment value, their scripts and storytelling SUCK in a way no movie has managed to suck.There is zero cohesion, closure, and at least half of all the subplots you're introduced to vanish in the story without making any sense. Regardless, these movies are so full of action, customes, jokes, and adventure, that you really wouldn't care about the bad storytelling. After all, it's still a pirate movie.

It pulls you right in from the start and gives you a sense of being a part of the action as if you were in each scene observing the characters. The cinematography, casting,acting, directing, costuming, screenplay, etc...were all near perfect. After seeing Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, I was not able to envision another person cast in that role. He did such a wonderful job and made the movie so fun that I believe all the other characters could have been sub-par and the film would have still stood strong. This, however, was not the case.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	"Ok, ok, I admit it.  I was a skeptic.  How in the world could they turn a ride from Disneyland into a good movie?  But, being the Disney fiend that I am, I went to see this movie when it came out, and I immediately fell in love.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is needing a new ship, so he sails into Port Royal.  Being a pirate, he fully intends to steal one.  He doesn't quite get away with it, however, and winds up in jail.That night, more pirates attack Port Royal.  But, instead of trying to free Captain Jack, they kill, pillage, and kidnap the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley).  Seems she has something they want.This doesn't sit well with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom).  He and Elizabeth have been friends since they were kids and he secretly loves her.  Despite his hatred of pirates, he makes a deal with Captain Jack to hunt down the Black Pearl and free Elizabeth.What Will and Elizabeth don't realize is there is a very real curse on the crew of the Black Pearl.  They believe Elizabeth is their only hope of lifting it, so they will stop at nothing to do just that.This movie works on every level.  While the story starts a little slowly, once the port is attacked, things pick up and the pace never lags.  The climax is a tad too long, but that's being nit picky.  Along the way we get some great swordplay, a couple double crosses, a few twists, and plenty of action.Johnny Depp as Captain Jack completely steals the show.  Not only is he given the best lines, but he delivers them so well.  Every scene he is in guarantees at least one laugh.That's not to diminish the work the other actors do.  Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are also fantastic and do get their own share of memorable lines.  Geoffrey Rush makes a great villain with his portrayal of Captain Barbossa.  The supporting cast is fine as well.The movie doesn't forget its roots.  There are loads of references to the famous ride including the song ""A Pirates Life for Me,"" and the line ""Dead men tell no tales.""  My favorite was the prisoners trying to attract the attention of the dog holding the key.  (Jack's line ""That dog is never going to move"" absolutely slays me.)  While they are fun for those familiar with the ride to spot, familiarity with the ride isn't essential to understanding the movie.  These bits add to the fun, but the story doesn't hinge on them.And I must mention the special effects.  There are lots of living skeletons in this film, and they look great.  A little dated looking already three years later, but again it's being nit picky.  This film could not have been made any earlier and had the same level of effectiveness.  The special effects blend seamlessly into the film.  And, most importantly, they support the story being told, not the other way around.While based on a Disney ride, this film is a rather scary ghost story with lots of violence.  Take the PG-13 rating seriously and view it to make sure your kids will enjoy it before you let them see it.Having said that, this is a wonderful film for teens and adults.  It's got adventure, humor, and romance all rolled into one."	5.0	"""You best start believing in ghost stories. You're in one."""	2006-06-20	2	2	0

"Disney went on a new marketing binge a few years ago and decided to commission feature films loosely based on attractions at their amusement parks.  There were a couple made based on the Haunted Mansion and the Country Bear Jamboree that were not well-received, but Pirates of the Caribbean hit a lot of people in their ""lets-have-fun-at-the-movies"" bones and won Johnny Depp a well-deserved Oscar nomination as a pirate captain named Jack Sparrow who teeters constantly at the edge of over-the-top.  He staggers and slurs - he has said that he patterned his performance after friend Keith Richards as he figures his character has the personna of a modern-day rock star.  I'm not sure what Mr. Richards thinks of this. There's a scene where Captain Jack gets drunk as a skunk on rum on a deserted island, and his personna really doesn't change at all.  Captain Jack has lost his beloved pirate ship, The Black Pearl, to his rival Captain Barbossa, played in an equally fun and over-the-top performance by Geoffrey Rush.  Barbossa is the yang to Sparrows ying and he gets absolutely fantastic lines like ""I'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request - that means NO!""Barbossa and the remainder of the Black Pearl crew are also inflicted with a curse that makes them undead, and when hit with moonlight they turn into skeletons - which makes for some fun and convincing special effects.  Keira Knightly plays the beautiful governor's daughter in the damsel-in-distress role and Orlando Bloom is rather bland as her intended.As long as you can accept pirate curses and fighting skeletons - suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride.... er movie.

The humorous  trait's of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) lends a unique twist to an old tale regarding pirates.This movie is pure, old-fashioned popcorn entertainment and it stands to become one of the finest films this year. This film is full of action & adventure and doesn't carry so much of an ounce of worthless drama that tends to drag good quality movies down with it. With the current glut of science fiction film, Pirates brings the failing genre up with a unique twist of swahsbuckling antics that is sure carry over into the sequel, Pirates of the Carribean 2.The DVD also contains deleted and extended scenes for those of you who really did enjoy this film. There is literally a ton of bonus features sure set to entertain after you've watched the main feature including how they were able to make the pirates teeth look rotten in the film. Disk 2 is a wonderful look behind the scenes of this wonderful film. It sure gives the Star Wars prequels a run for its money and the story is a lot better as well.	5.0	Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl	2003-12-04	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2DAHERP7HYJGO	Mark Turner	PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL gives movie fanatics something they haven't enjoyed for some time now. A pirate movie that does not condescend to the viewer and shows an admiration for those classic films of the past. With little to cheer about since the days of Captain Blood and The Crimson Pirate, its about time one was made.Based on the Disney ride of the same name, the movie doesn't just talk about a ride or go near the theme park. Instead, we are given an in depth plot with twists and turns that maneuver the viewer around until the final reel.Taking place in the Caribbean (hey, didn't you read the title?) the story revolves around a young woman, the daughter of the Governor, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Fascinated by pirates and all things around them, she helps a young shipwrecked victim named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) on her journey to her new home, taking from his neck a medallion so that he won't be tossed overboard as a pirate.Years later, now grown, the two are in love but can never show it. She is of the aristocracy and he is a mere blacksmith. But adventure enters their lives and changes things for good.A run in with a real life pirate named Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a curse that was placed on the medallion and the entrance of a ghost ship called the Black Pearl result in the capture of Elizabeth. Bound and determined to rescue the woman he loves, Turner sides with Jack and the pair steal a ship, find a crew in Tortuga and set to sea to find the Black Pearl and her crew.But the captain of the Black Pearl, a pirate known as Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) has plans of his own. It seems that the ship and its crew are cursed. And the only way for them to return to the real world is by collecting the last coin that they stole from an Aztec treasure. That coin is the medallion that Elizabeth wears around her neck. And blood of the person wearing it will be the second item needed for their release.The action and adventure move along from there as Turner and Sparrow must rescue the fair maiden from the clutches of the evil pirate. But there is more going on beneath the obvious. To find out what, you'll have to see the film.The action quotient of this movie is over the top. The sets, the costume, the writing, the direction are all up to par for a film of this sort. Johnny Depp turns in one of his most over the top (yes as much as ED WOOD) performances and it suits his character to a T.The biggest plus for this one though is its special effects. You had to have seen them in the numerous previews already. The pirates are revealed as they truly are under the light of a full moon. Thus we have walking corpses and skeletons setting out to capture the coin and sail a ship to its final destination. These scenes have to be seen to be believed.If you're looking for something that will beat the summer heat, swash your buckle and hoist your sails, then this movie is the one for you. Entertaining from beginning to end.	5.0	SHIVER  ME TIMBERS!!!	2008-03-15	2	0	2

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1HFIKNWLABJIN	"mark ""weeping_guitar"""	"Pirate films are few and far between these days and a truly great one is a day dream away. When the phrases of ""based off Disneyland ride"" and ""produced by Jerry Bruckheimer"" are thrown about to describe a 2003 summer mega-budget blockbuster we're right to be quite worried. Let the mocking begin. This could never work, or can it? Well, it couldn't without Johnny Depp who as Capn' Jack Sparrow not only steals the show, but the whole summer. His Keith Richards meets Long John Silver act is so engrossing and entertaining that the rest of the film's elements need to be passable at best to make it work, and they do that and more.Director Gore Verbinski does exactly what a summer film should do and that is to be fun, witty, and flashy without selling it's audience short. The film does have tremendous special effects and action, but the characters triumph over them all with a terrific cast performing from a script from the people behind Shrek that makes the pirate genre look like a treasure chest of gold once again. Every pirate clich&eacute; is here it all it's glory and Verbinski embraces them all to make an fantastically fun picture. There is plenty of sword fights, towns pillaged, secret treasures, parrots, and pirate talk that are all utilized with a limited cringe factor.As the historic Mr. Sparrow (Johnny Depp) makes his most memorable entrance he's set on stealing a ship, but instead saves the governor's daughter from the deep sea and gets a thank you trip to the gallows. As he awaits his fate the ship Black Pearl, which Sparrow once captained until mutiny did him in, lays into the Governor's harbor town, kidnapping Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightly), the governor's daughter. Lucky for Jack is that local blacksmith Will Turner is quite taken with Elizabeth and breaks Sparrow out and in return the good Cap'n will assist in Miss Swan's rescue. The duo will have to track down the Pearl under the leadership of Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) who, along with his crew, suffers the curse of the Black Pearl in which they're men by day, but the moonlight shows them for their true immortal skeletons selves.It cannot be underestimated what a joy it is to watch Depp transform this film into something special. He speaks with a drunken slur ala Keith Richards and has an androgynous look that he plays up with use of flailing arms and flamboyancy at every turn. He's a legend no doubt with the swashbuckling pirates and if there truly is a small line between madness and genius Depp portrays it with perfection. The other main players do their job well with Orlando Bloom playing the straight man to Depp's wavy while Knightly's beauty and spirit fill out her damsel in not so much distress character. Geoffrey Rush is a treat as the sea-faring menace who led the mutiny against Sparrow."	4.0	Shiver Me Timbers, We've Got a Hit!	2003-07-11	4	4	0

Camp	I am almost ashamed to tell you that I have seen this movie 9 times in the theatre and can't wait to own it on DVD - almost, I say, but not quite - Johnny Depp had proven once again that he is a national treasure - this movie literally belongs to him, from the opening scene to the last shot in the film - he plays Jack Sparrow with tongue held firmly in cheek, the only way to play this role - his supporting cast is excellent, especially Geoffrey Rush, as his nemesis - this is not just the best pirate movie ever made, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen, PERIOD  -  It has run away with the summer box office receipts and deservedly so - I sincerely hope that Johnny Depp gets an Academy Award nomination for his sly and knowing performance - I don't care if he doesn't win, but not to niminate him would be a crime.	5.0	Easily the best pirate movie ever made.	2003-09-27	2	2	0

The movie also features one of the hottest new rising stars (the elf from Lord of the Rings) Orlando Bloom.The story is amazing and original and if you're not into adventure movies you have to see this movie for very awesome special effects.There's love, passion, crime, adventure, revenge, lots of pirates plus Johnny and Orlando.A great Disney movie for the whole family.I wish I could give this movie more than 5 stars.	5.0	Johnny, oh Johnny	2004-01-07	2	2	0

It's Fantastic!  I was reading some of the other reviews and I have to say that I was surprise at one saying it was too long.  I saw it three days ago.  I'm not a clock-watcher, but I was amazed to read that it was a 2 1/2 hour movie!  I had no idea I was in there for that long - it totaly took me out of time for the duration.Johnny Depp is fantastic.  I've always liked him, but this was extra fabulous.  Orlando even has us 40 year olds drooling - good looking and a great performance to boot.I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I will definitely buy it on DVD.  I don't think I will take the kids (8 and 11) to see it at the theater because even though overall it's not a horror film, there are some scenes that in the dark of the theater, on the big screen and with the loud surround sound going on would probably terrify them, but they will LOVE it on DVD, I'm sure.	5.0	Wow! does not even begin to express it!	2003-08-06	0	0	0

Although the story line is comic book simple (yes, straight from the ride in Disneyland), and the sets and special effects are grand, it was the acting that kept my interest.  Never afraid to look foolish (and thereby, they rarely do), the actors jump into their roles with wonderful relish.  Orlando Bloom repeats his swordsmanship from ""Lord of the Rings"" with expert craft and Geoffrey Rush skillfully convinces us that he is just as mad as he was in the ""Marquis de Sade"", but now seems to be having more fun.  The standout, with no surprise, is Johnny Depp's swishy pirate revival.  His androgynous swagger, expressive eyes and talent of delivering a witful line is pure mastery.  It should be no surprise that he was nominated for best actor, especially regarding his less than pro-Hollywood views.  This film is pure family entertainment with no thinking required.The extra features are especially rewarding with much more than most DVD's.  The commentaries can be a tad self-rewarding and the CD-ROM feature could have been better, but the bloopers, deleted scenes and `behind the scenes' portions are great fun."	4.0	Mindless Family Fun!	2004-02-26	3	3	0

I was very dissapointed.I am a big Disney fan so this review is not anti-Disney.Much like movies based upon video games, movies based upon theme park rides just don't work. Or haven't worked yet. This movie had everything you could ask for. Major Stars, Major Director, Major Producer but NO PLOT. That is not fair of course it had a plot, just not a good one. And the plot that they did have has so many holes in it that as the end I was left asking myself &quot;did I really just see what I thought I did?&quot;Special effects were great, but once again studios don't care about the writing. How can you have a good movie without a good script?But it all comes down to box office and since this one made millions, there will be more like it and the Hulk and Dare Devil and the list could go on forever.Save your time and money.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2SAACJP0XRK3	Matthew Comegys	"I saw this for the first time on DVD upon its release, so I have a relatively fresh view of the movie.  I missed it this summer because I was living on an island and sailing, so the nautical theme really appealed to me.  In fact the lack of theatres made me a bit annoyed.In terms of story and direction, this is just an average (not bad) summer Hollywood popcorn flick.  It has all the set pieces to put you on the edge of your seat, and plenty of bang for your buck.  The undead pirates becoming skeletons as they walk though beams of moonlight was a particularly inspired touch.  What puts this over the top to become a great summer flick, however, is the acting.  Kira Knightly and Orlando Bloom put on fine performances, but as many have already noted Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush own this picture.  If the Oscars gave awards for spectacularly over-the-top performances, these guys would be in like flint.Rush just oozes with the amusing sort of evil; the kind of evil that you don't take too seriously, but adds that needed element of danger to the movie.  It really is a long way from ""Shine.""Johnny Depp apparently found a great mass outlet for his surreal character acting style (as a friend of mine noted, he's sort of a charater actor in a leading man's body).  He's supposedly channeling Keith Richards, and it shows.  I also detected some residual elements left over from Depp's mindbogglingly good portrayal of Hunter S. Thompson a few years back.  Check out some of Captain Jack Sparrow's hand motions and running stances if you need some proof.  Depp also gets some great one-liners, and gives them the best delivery this side of Bill Murray.The disc is technically superior too.  If the picture isn't what the film geeks (so I'm one too; just not a particularly technical-minded one) call ""reference quality,"" I don't know what is.  I played the DTS track and it was going wild in all of the speakers of my living room.As far as extras go, the 1968 special about the opening of the Pirates ride is particularly amusing.  Walt himself makes an appearance, and the female hosts come across as ther Stepford Wives.  Very creepy.  The featurette give the audience a run through of the ride itself too.  I remember totally digging it as a kid at Disney World, but I think the room full of animatronics would be a bit creepy these days (imagine being theguy or gal that has to clean them at night after the park is closed... spooky!).  There is a documentary on real life pirates present on the disc too.  It's geared towards a younger audience (well, at least attention span wise), but still manages to get some good information across.This is the sort of film that puts brainless entertainment in the best possible light, and threatens to make a good name for it.  A solid movie and a solid DVD.  And if you're of age, I would heartily recommend taking in this movie with a bottle of Carribean rum.  It'll get you screaming along with all of the ""Ahrrrs!"""	4.0	More Like Improbable	2003-12-05	2	2	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A13TO1ZFAH9SVN	Matthew Edmundson	Pirates of the Caribbean is the best movie to come out this year. I had to admit I was skeptic about a movie based off a ride, but I was so wrong.I'm not going to tell you much about the story line. I'm going to say a little bit about it and then what I liked. I don't like to tell much of the story, because I think it takes away from the experience of seeing the movie.Pirates is a pirate movie. The good guys most stop the pirates, save the girl, and the end the curse.Johnny Depp is outstanding. There is nothing he did wrong with the movie. He brought great charm to it, and was so sarcastic. He really does steal the show, and has made himself into what will be one of the most beloved characters in movie history. He really is that great.Orlando Bloom was good as well. A lot of people have knocked him for what he did in the movie and have accused him of being a bad actor. While Bloom was brought in to bring the ladies to the theatar, he plays a great action hero. I thought he played the role as Will Turner to perfection, and I just can't see what people had against him.Keira Knightly was awesome. I think she is incredibly hot and will be a big hollywood star one day. She plays Elizabeth well for what they gave her to work with.The special effects are the other reason to go. They were done by Industrial Light & Magic. The pirates look great when you see the curse in action on them. It's some of the best of the year, and will probaly draw Oscar nominations.Like I said, Pirates is the best movie of the year so far. Depp should find some kind of academy consideration for his role as should the movie for best picture. It's fun for the whole the family, and is a must for any movie fan.	5.0	Excellent Movie	2003-10-06	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A6DMQ1ZU7YS9O	"Matthew Higdon ""California Chariot"""	"Unlike some films ('The Musketeer,' 'Godzilla,' 'Solaris,' etc.) from not so long ago, Walt Disney's PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is not a disappointment to the expectations of its genre. Quite the contrary; it is a high-sea swashbuckling spectacle that truly entertains.A vessel of Her Majesty's Royal Navy - navigating through murky waters near South America - stumbles upon a boy (William Turner) with a mysterious medallion. Nothing is made of that, until eight years later, when a pirate ship ventures into the harbor of Port Royal, an island outpost in the Caribbean Sea. Its crew disembarks and blasts its way into town, shooting, knifing, searching. Repossessing the medallion leads to kidnapping the governor's daughter Elizabeth (who has kept secret charge of it since its discovery) . . . and the now-grown Will Turner joins forces with swaggering pirate ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow to rescue the girl ... and settle an old score.Johnny Depp pulls down a distinguished performance (for which he received an Academy Award nomination) as the comedic Jack Sparrow, a conveniently-underestimated pirate and victim of a mutiny led by his former first mate, Barbosa. Sparrow's only real cinematic flaw is an overreliance on mascara. The people and story assert that the pirate code consists more of `guidelines' than rules to be followed; we are left to wonder why Barbosa's offscreen mutiny is appealed to as some kind of actual wrong (""it wasn't right with the code"") when that code only sets out guidelines. Though not a major set-back, one might imagine that the response of the British officers toward certain persons' actions (toward the movie's end) feels a bit unrealistic, almost as though the filmmakers felt pushed by the need to wrap things up in light of the encroaching 150-minute mark and so force the persons in question to behave and react contrary to character. If the film has any further moviemaking weakness, it is (as perhaps hinted above) that it feels slightly drawn out, and is somewhat lacking in the kind of heart that made THE MASK OF ZORRO and THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO notably `passionate' presentations. In those respects, PIRATES doesn't seem great enough to qualify for epic status; though it is a much further cry from the disaster that some were expecting.That this is a `family' film seems disputable. While Disney has long been known as a manufacturer of family entertainment, here the violence - while not actually gory - may be a little too severe and explicit for very young children. Carousing fills in the context of a scene or two. Also, due to a deadly curse, a crew of pirates is cast as a company of unsightly decomposing (and nonetheless `living') skeletons in the pale moonlight. To visualize the movie as another regular PG-13 action-adventure flick would impart a more accurate understanding.With clashes of swordfighting, commandeering, blossoming romance, piracy and heroism, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN takes you on an enjoyable ride.DVD features are pluriform: nearly 20 alternate and deleted scenes, blooper reel, audio commentary, featurettes, an interactive history of pirates, diaries, image galleries, storyboards, and more."	4.0	A Pirate's Life For Me	2004-12-27	7	5	2
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	"The idea of making a movie based on an amusement park ride -in this case, The Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disney World - seems risky to me. This be the formula for making The Biggest Dumb Movie of the Year. But somewhere in the moviemaking process, Disney found some of its magic at work. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" may not be the greatest film released in 2003, but it is, in my eyes, the most fun. Ironically, it has much in common with the thrill ride which inspired it because, ditzy and illogical as it may be, it is so wildly imaginative, you want to turn around and experience it again.The story takes place a few hundred years ago in and around a Caribbean island owned by the British. Elizabeth [Keira Knightley] is the beautiful young daughter of the island's governor. She seems destined to be married off to a priggish British Naval officer, though her heart belongs to Will [Orlando Bloom], a handsome blacksmith's apprentice whose life she saved years ago during a pirate attack.The love story is a good setup for the action that follows. Enter Jack Swallow [Johnny Depp], a `mad as a hatter' pirate in need of a ship. Enter the Black Pearl, the fastest ship in the Caribbean, and its cursed crew. The Black Pearl's captain, Barbossa [Geoffrey Rush], is the one who marooned Jack, the former captain, on a small island. After this dastardly act, Barbossa and his mates tried to steal some Aztec gold. Turns out the gold had a curse on it. Unless they retrieve a medallion now worn by Elizabeth, they are doomed to being half dead and half alive zombies. Can Elizabeth help to save the day? Can Will accept his true origins, including the real story of the medallion? Can the dazed and confused Jack Sparrow come through?I don't think Depp has ever not taken a role seriously, and here he creates one his most memorable characters - his Sparrow is one of the most unlikely heroes you will ever see onscreen. His decision to play Sparrow as a cross between a lunatic and a drag queen was a stroke of genius and adds immeasurably to the movie's success. It may be that his performance inspired the other actors - all good ones to begin with - to rise to the challenge. Or perhaps director Gore Verbinski [""The Ring"", ""The Mexican'] just has a way with actors. Whatever the reason, the acting here is way above average for a movie of this type.""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is highly recommended."	5.0	An exceptional adventure	2003-12-24	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AKZ1Q9S0Z3G6V	"Matthew Perri ""Matthew Perri"""	"Prancin' pirates and a plot that doesn't know where it's going.There's a lot going on...too much going on. That said, here's the long and the short of it:The movie begins with a flashback of sorts. A young girl on her father's navy ship finds a broken-up boat in the middle of the ocean along with a boy, floating on top of a piece of the boat's hull. The boy is wearing a medallion and the girl takes it from him after his rescue. The girl's father suspects pirates...not just any pirates...the ones who make their home aboard the Black Pearl.Cut to about ten years or so later.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a pirate who has come into port of a Caribbean-shore town in search of a ship that will take him back to his old ship, the Black Pearl. In this town, the girl (played by the beautiful Keira Knightly) wears the medallion around her neck after dreaming of the day she found the boy, (now played by Orlando Bloom). He's the town's expert blacksmith now and he dreams of one day marrying Elizabeth.Sparrow attempts to make off with a navy-ship to find his old one and Elizabeth ends up fainting and falling into the ocean after attempting to wear a bodice given to her by her father as a gift. This is one of the biggest pushes in the entire film. While in the drink, the medallion around her neck sends a shockwave throughout the sea, ""calling"" to the crew aboard the Black Pearl. Sparrow is identified as a pirate and is arrested, even after rescuing Elizabeth from drowning.His first escape-attempt leads him to William, the blacksmith boy, who engages in sword-to-sword combat in attempt to keep Sparrow in one place until the troops arrive. Sparrow ends up in jail...of course, it isn't long before the Black Pearl ends up attacking the town, rapin', pillagin', and plunderin'. They grab Elizabeth because they need the medallion...and that's where I stop.Everyone in this film is fun to watch, has their own personality (including the pirates) and you'll have jolly good fun taking in the atmosphere, the mood, and the piratin'...the only problem with it is most of it seems to be padded out. Scenes that should climax with a battle or a fight end up in long-winded discussions on pirate-policies and rules and regs. This is what brings on the doldrums and unneccessary scenes of conversation. It goes on too long. You have a dinner-scene with the captain, a fight with a dismembered forearm, Sparrow and Elizabeth stranded, Sparrow facing death at the end, and his subsequent rescue, all which could have been tightened up or otherwise forgotten. We STILL have no idea HOW Sparrow got off the island to find his old ship in the first place! The story also forks off a little more than it needs to and you can't really root for Sparrow because him and William don't get along and Sparrow constantly turns his back on William and his friends. And so the movie sails on and on much longer than it needs to sail. Not that it's no fun to watch. It most certainly is that, but it's just not solid. Director Gore Verbinski (THE RING, THE MEXICAN) MUST have received final cut in his contract when he signed on because there is NO cutting at all. I must have counted at least six to eight scenes that should have hit the cutting room floor. But they're all here. Verbinski just doesn't seem to grasp the concept of the DVD.As for the acting, Depp looks and acts great as a pirate who has gone a little nutty but still knows how to wheel and deal to get his way. Think of him as Han Solo's great-great-grand-ancestor and you've got the idea. Geoffrey Rush is wonderful as the Captain of the Black Pearl and really makes a great villian. Orlando Bloom, the invincible elf in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy plays a handsome hero/sometimes-sidekick to Jack Sparrow and he's fine.The best part of this film is the atmosphere and the visuals. You feel like you're with the pirates, you can feel the sea, smell it, you can inhale the mustiness of the jail cells...and if you keep a sharp eye, catch some of the nods to original ride at Disneyland and Disney World.All-in-all, it's a trip worth taking."	3.0	Yo-ho, yo-ho, please trim this film some more...	2003-07-10	23	6	17
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2689A2EVQSEJJ	"Matthew T. Shelley ""sanctuary_thirteen"""	I really must give two separate reviews.  The first, and easiest.This is a fun movie.  A dark end sinister villain plagues ports, a valiant and noble hero, with a entertaining yet effective keith richards sidekick.  Johnny depp as always is enamouring, and the eye shadow really works for him.  Its a movie you can sit down, have some fun, and really just be entertained.  But because of the Vastness of the production, I had higher expectations in certain departments.  The classic &quot;marry me even though im a stuffy jerk&quot; line has been used to death, even by Disney.  And our hero is basically a bumbling Legolas.  While I honestly like orlando bloom, I think maybe he should have finished acting school.  Elves are one thing, they dont show emotion.as far as overall nautical realism, its a joke.  a crew of a half dozen can keep a ship afloat for months?  unlikely.  and ripped sails generally means no moving.  but of course, thats not what this film is about.  if thats what we wanted, then a flying mustang would have put bruckheimer on the butcher block.  realism on the sea calls for master and commander: far side of the world.  This calls for you to stop and rethink its purpose.  its a fun family action film that just happens to pull you in, unlike most others films that simply present you with a scene and expect you to accept it.  Verbinski truly has a knack for creating a 3D environment.  you not only feel what you see is real, you feel what is behind you is real too.  you feel the sun, you smell the salt, and most of all, you can smell those pirates.this movie should have come out 20 years ago when i was a kid.  I would have been so thankful.  but im thankful that it came out, even though i dont want to be a pirate anymore...this makes me feel i still could.excellent.	4.0	A fun interjection	2003-12-20	0	0	0

The script does lead well to his strengths.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1VTFWNYYCJMG0	"MBA ""MBA"""	Having heard terrifc word of mouth over the summer, I was excited to see &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; on DVD.  I really wanted to like this movie.  Unfortunately, the film never quite lived up to all the hype.Here's what I liked:1.  Decent cinemetography and good choice of outdoor shooting locations.2.  The actors seemed to be enjoying themselves.  No one took their performances too seriously.  None of that &quot;I can't believe I went to Julliard for this!&quot; subtext.Here's what I did not like:1.  Johnny Depp.  Yes, I know everyone has praised his performance.  For me, Johnny was merely adequate as the happy-go-lucky Jack Sparrow.  Over the top?  Certainly!  Brilliant, no.  There's no great skill to hamming it up.  In fact, he comes off as a bit mannered.2.  Running jokes that sink like lead balloons.  How many times do we have to endure the same jokes over and over again about &quot;Jack Sparrow&quot; being the worst / best pirate ever?  Other jokes repeated so frequently that they lose any freshness they might have once had.3.  Slow pacing.  It took over an hour of exposition to set up the primary conflict between Jack and the Pirates of the Carribean.  The movie totals over 2 hours.  You would think they could have picked up the pace and edited out some of the klunkier exposition.4.  That annoying soundtrack.  Did the soundtrack sound familiar to you despite the tinny orchestra?  There's a reason why . . . They recycled most of it from music by Hans Zimmer for Gladiator.  Just check the credits . . .5.  Cheesy special effects.  I know that George Lucas' Industrial Lights and Magic did the special effects for the movie.  Unfortunately, the CGI magic didn't quite work here.  I couldn't suspend disblief . . . everything looked very &quot;digital.&quot;	2.0	Arrgh, matey!  Pirates sinks under weight of clunky script!	2003-12-03	39	11	28
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3LWA5BX43AP8D	"M. Bigg ""Mal"""	No review is really needed for this movie - almost everyone has seen it & knows how they feel about it and if box-office is anything to go by everyone loved it, For me it was a little overrated.  Depp went too far with his characterization, though I generally love his work. Special effects were good but standard for the time.  I loved the nods to the original ride (which I never went on but saw Disney video of) for example the drunk on the wine barrel among others. So I'd say the movie is a great ride but I won't be going on it again too soon.	3.0	One for the Blu ray collection only - I've got kids.	2013-08-20	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AESY8NCX6VS6O	M. Burns	"There are some movies that need to be more than two hours long: ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Gladiator,"" ""Magnolia."" This summer's blockbuster ""Pirates of the Carribean"" is DEFINITELY not one that falls into that category, and its main flaw happens to be its drastically overlong running time (two and one half hours). Not only could the editor of the film have spent some more time doing some snipping, but the movie's sugary-sweet submental-script is embarrasingly spare. Its screenwriters MUST have spent a lot of time describing people getting hit in the head with various metal objects (a drinking game could be created with that overdone aspect of the film), for that seems to be a crutch on which the movie unfortunately leans. Yes, I'll agree with most of the rest of the movie-going public and say that Johnny Depp is fantastic in this film - he almost redeems it...almost. Sadly, the movie just goes on and on and on and on, jumping from ship to ship, and ""Pirates"" never seems to reach solid ground. Depp's performance becomes the only good thing about this movie, and it goes without saying that filmmaker Gore Verbinski (""The Ring"") should have just stayed on shore. Is the movie fun? Occasionally...but fun can only last for so long. Maybe DVD is a better medium for ""Pirates"" after all, though, because I sure could have used a fast-forward button in the theater."	2.0	Vastly overrated summer-movie fluff...	2003-10-01	16	2	14

"Sure, the trailer for this film looks good. And I fancied seeing it. And I finally got to see it. And did I like it? Not in the slightest. There's nothing remotely scary about it and cos it's aimed at the kids, and it's only a 12, there's not enough scariness in it to even terrify an adult.I'm not an Orlando Bloom girl. He's too much of a pretty boy for my liking. Now Johnny Depp may be approaching 40, but he's much more my type. I like older men! In this film, he's pure comic genius. Not since Benny & Joon has he been so funny! The simple expressions on his face kept making me choke on whatever I was drinking at the time. I would buy this film purely for him. But not just now, and I don't think I'd be tempted to watch it for any other reason than Johnny Depp. The best thing about Johnny is he hasn't been stereotyped like most Hollywood actors (see Hugh Grant). He prefers to star in low budget films, or appears in these box office successes. And he appears only eight minutes into the film, whereas I was expecting him to appear much later on.Keira Knightly is becoming a great actress in her own right, after becoming successful after Bend It Like Beckham. She manages to play the role of Elizabeth Swan perfectly. She's seen near the beginning of the film being forced into a corset, and then comes out with the classic, funny line near the end of the film: ""Like pain . . . try wearing a corset"".OK, Orlando Bloom is a good actor. I'll give him that. I just don't see the appeal and why all the women seem to be going ga-ga over him since he hit the big time.This film may appeal to the little ones. All the special effects (which is frankly nothing new), and the storybook quality might blow them away. But it's not for me. I was determined to watch the film right to the end (you never know, it could have got better), but I needed a stiff drink to watch it right through."	3.0	"""Like pain . . . try wearing a corset!"""	2004-01-03	2	1	1

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2OIG88PG8K4M3	"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado"""	"Literally. More things get blown and/or broken to bits in this film than in the last three I've seen combined. However, this isn't a bad thing, as the action makes for some of the most spectacular scenes in my recent memory.The film starts out promisingly, and sets itself up fairly quickly. Elizabeth Swann (played irritatingly feministic by Keira Knightley), on her way to the Caribbean with her father, the governor of one of the islands, saves the life of a young lad floating amidst the wreckage of a - what else? - pirate ship. He wears about his neck a gold coin, which curious Elizabeth can't help but filch. (She later explains that it was to save young Will Turner from being branded a pirate, but that failed to convince me that she wasn't just being sticky-fingered. She is a pirate wanna-be, after all.)Flash-forward eight years. (At least, that is how long the film says it is, although the two protagonists seem to have aged more than that.) Elizabeth is now a beautiful socialite (with an impassioned hatred of corsets) who spends her days warding off unwelcomed advances. Will is a less-than-brawny blacksmith (who is, I must add, very nicely toned, just not as bulky as I expected of a blacksmith) who never seems to get any credit for all his work and practises three hours a day with swords. (Jack Sparrow suggests this implies Will needs to get a girl.) Will does have one, though she's the classic maiden-adored-from-afar-off: he's been smitten with Elizabeth since he set eyes on her. She, it seems, harbours an affection for him that she will not quite admit to.Into this mix comes (or rather, floats) Jack Sparrow (sorry, that's CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow), the ""best pirate I've ever seen."" His entrance into the film is absolutely brilliant comedy, so I won't spoil it for the dozen or so people who haven't seen the film yet. Johnny Depp handles this role so well, makes Jack Sparrow so hysterically outlandish, that he makes you completely forget that pirates are indeed very nasty things instead of incredible comics with freaky eye-makeup and braided beards. (This is more than made up for by Geoffrey Rush, who as Captain Barbossa convinced me that he was indeed a very, very nasty thing.)Capt. Jack manages to get captured - and escape - several times before the ""real"" action begins. These scenes are hilarious; I laughed aloud so often it was good I had the theatre to myself. He runs into Will Turner, who defends Elizabeth from a perceived offence in a swordmatch that is absolutely breathtaking. I have never, ever seen swordplay so fast, so clever, and so funny all at once. Some have called Orlando Bloom the next Errol Flynn, and I heartily agree: he handles himself well in his roles, and his polished good looks and lightning-fast moves look splendid onscreen. He's got just enough ""darkness"" to him - those smoldering brown eyes, that dark, slightly uncontrollable hair - to make him believable. (And this comes from a woman who doesn't even profess to be a Screaming Fan-Girl.)As with most action flicks, the plot is disposable, but not too stupid; if you are going to see a Pirate Film, you're likely not expecting a deeply insightful social commentary anyway. As it's not at all necessary to the enjoyment of seeing the film, I shan't bother summarising it at all.The screenplay itself sizzles with wit, especially from Jack (who has all the best lines in the film), and the stunts and lavish costumes are enough to keep one thorougly enjoying oneself. (Who can object to slightly tight silk trousers and flowy shirts open to the waist, exposing tanned, toned bodies? Not me!) The locations are absolutely gorgeous - I wouldn't be surprised if the Caribbean cruise lines are booked solid after people see some of the places in this film!There's not much in the movie to warrant a PG-13 rating - some doe-eyed looks, hand-holding, and one kiss at the very end are the limit of the onscreen romance - but I think this was more for caution than content. Some children might find the undead crew turning to skeletons in the light of the moon rather frightening (my mother did, but she has never been one for zombies). This is really handled fairly well, though, as the macabre effect is lightened by a quirky sense of humour. (The idea of a disembodied arm having a fight with a person is hilarious to me.)There really is only one minor quibble I have with this film: I could have done without Elizabeth. (I don't know that Will Turner would have appreciated this much, but he could always have had me instead...) In her day she'd have been locked up in a convent for her conduct; it simply wasn't acceptable. Strong-willed, smart-aleck heroines may work in modern-day films, but I found her distractingly anachronistic in a ""period"" piece. (For instance, trouser-wearing is completely out of the question.) Playing her slightly more demurely girl-like would have suited me much better.All in all, it's no stirring insightful piece, but that's not what we go to the movies for. It is, however, a rollicking good time, one of the best experiences I've had in the theatre for years. See it, and be sure to bring a handkerchief - you WILL laugh yourself to tears.~ Megan Stoner"	5.0	Smashing!!!	2003-08-24	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A5OCFZ2KE8LLH	Meghan Freed	Pirates of the Caribbean has struck gold!  Johnny Depp stars as the hilarious Cpt. Jack Sparrow, who is a drunk pirate, but will get you laughing for the rest of the movie.  He makes you laught like you have never laughed before.  After being marroned, he arrives in Port Royal and is almost nearly killed by the British. There he meets the blacksmith Will Turner, played by hottie Orlando Bloom, and is thrown in jail.  One night, Sparrow's former ship, the Black Pearl, which is the fastest ship in the Caribbean, attacks Port Royal and kidnaps the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann, played by Keira Knightley. Will decides to free Jack from jail only to save his childhood crush.  While on the Black Pearl, Elizabeth realizes that the crew on the ship is cursed and are between dead and alive.  They are normal during the day, but become skeletons in the moonlight.  In order to break the curse, they must take the blood of a pirate and put it on pure Aztec gold. But Will has the one coin that stops them from breaking the curse because his father was a former Black Pearl crewmate.  I won't tell the rest because you have to see the movie to see what happen's in the end.  Overall, the movie is a bit long, (2 and a half hours), but has you begging for more. I must say that Orlando Bloom is HOT and Johnny Depp with black mascara and make-up has you guessing what he looks like without all of that hair and make-up.  Another reason to see it is the special effects.  They are out of this world, especially with the skeletons.  I hope this review helped and GO SEE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN!

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A35GE8E8K2D86B	Melanie	Pirates of the Caribbean is an amazing combination of action and adventure that just about everyone enjoys. It has a superb plot, and enough action sequences to keep the audience interested.We first meet Elizabeth as a young girl aboard a ship heading to the Caribbean. We also get a chance to see a bit of  Norrington's character as well. The action starts quickly after Elizabeth finds Will floating in the water. After that, the plot picks up even more as we are introduced to the characters as they will be throughout the rest of the movie.But what about Johnny Depp? Of course he makes an appearance near the beginning of the movie as Cap'n Jack Sparrow, and he is hysterical. While the rest of the main characters are at a promotion for Norrington, Jack tries to steal a ship. Here, the plots collide when Jack has to rescue Elizabeth. (It's a long story why, you'll just have to watch the movie) Next comes the best action sequences (in my opinion) of the movie. Jack and Will have an awesome swordfight scene, all the while keeping up a great dialogue. The rest of the movie follows that same kind of pattern.Elizabeth gets kidnapped by the Black Pearl, where she learns something very interesting about the pirates and their curse. (Chances are you already know what this is, but in case you don't, I won't say it) Of course, Will, trying to be the &quot;knight in shining armor&quot; tries to rescue Elizabeth, but doesn't know where to start looking, so he has to team up with Jack. Humor follows Jack all the way through the movie, so of course simply getting out of Port Royal was hysterical.As for the rest of the movie, it is filled with great action and funny scenes. The plot does seem to move slowly at times, but usually you don't honestly care too much about it. This is a great movie to watch on a rainy day, when you have plenty of time to really watch it.The DVD features are definitely worth the cost. The deleted scenes, especially the scene with Jack and Elizabeth marrooned on the island, are spectacular, and they really help you to undersatnd the film better. The blooper reel is great, and probably the best special feature on the disc. Another great thing about this DVD is the commentaries. One of the commentaries is only selected scenes from the movie, so the entire thing only takes about half an hour. This is great because you don't have to sit through the entire movie again. There are other extras, like a tour around a ship of the era and a few documentaries, all of which are worth watching.All in all, this is a great movie well worth the cost and time.	5.0	A spectacular ride the whole way through	2004-02-17	0	0	0

But when I saw that Johnny Depp appeared, his careless and casual way attracted everyone to him. He was witty and funny-looking, making me one of the millions of the fans obsessed with Johnny Depp. On the other side Orlando was an expert swordsman and later he and Johnny Depp made the perfect pirate pair. Also Orlando Bloom has wonderful love with the heroine. I have to talk some about the skeletons because they are so powerful. They got cursed from the missing coins, so they must find the coins and correct them; otherwise they would never die, so they gave lots troubles to Johnny and Orlando. So it made the story became more interesting. Formerly I never liked a role so quickly and so profoundly as Johnny Depp's role. So it's a recommended movie for anyone who likes action, humor and adventure, and it's a good entertaining movie. I hope you will enjoy it.	5.0	"My Favorite ""Pirate"""	2005-05-20	2	1	1

But when I saw it, I was blown away! I could not believe how wonderful this movie is! Johnyy Depp(Captain Jack Sparrow) helped lighten the movie with his strange ways. I have never been a Depp fan until now. Orlando Bloom(Will Turner) was amazing, even though this was his very first role in which he is a huge character.There were so many diverse ages in the theater. They ranked from age 5, all the way past 80. Everyone in that entire theater was laughing. If you have not seen this movie, I recommend you do so before it isn't playing in theaters anymore. It is definately money well spent. I already have room on my shelf for the DVD release. I have seen the movie ten times! It is the best movie of the summer!	5.0	Ahoy! Pirate Lovers!	2003-08-19	1	1	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	In 2003, Walt Disney Pictures (along with First Mate Productions and Jerry Bruckheimer Films) produced what is probably one of the best pirate films of the past two decades.  Under the direction of Gore Verbinski (who directed &quot;The Ring&quot; in 2002), &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; is a very entertaining and engaging film in large due to the wonderful acting of Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom (who played &quot;Legolas Greenleaf&quot; in all three &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films between 2001 and 2003), Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley, as well as superb special effects, good cinematography and good writing.  The principle writers for the film, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, have previously collaborated their writing skills on such films as &quot;Little Monsters&quot; (1989), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992) and the highly successful &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001), to name a few.  Two other writers who helped to write this film are Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert.The story, which was probably inspired by a ride of a similar name at the Disneyland amusement park in California, follows the life of a woman, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), from when she is child (played by Lucinda Dryzek) while she and her father, Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), are en route to Port Royal.  After successfully fending off a pirate attack, a boy named William Turner (Dylan Smith) escapes from the pirate ship and travels to Port Royal with Elizabeth and her father.  As a memento of the attack, Elizabeth keeps a gold coin that she finds in Will's clutched hand.  As an adult, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) works as a blacksmith.  Enter the enigmatic pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who is not particularly welcome at Port Royal.  He is imprisoned by Gov. Swann, but escapes when Port Royal is attacked by the pirate ship named the Black Pearl, which is commanded by Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush).  Jack wants the Black Pearl, Elizabeth is kidnapped and the nature of the curse is revealed.Memorable scenes in the film include the pirate attack during Elizabeth's childhood, Jack's arrival at Port Royal, Jack meeting Will, the attack upon the port, Elizabeth onboard the Black Pearl, Will and Jack leaving the port, and the scenes at the Isla de Muerta.  Other memorable characters include Mr. Gibbs (Kevin McNally), Koehler (Treva Etienne), Norrington (Jack Davenport), Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook), Pintel (Lee Arenberg), Mullroy (Angus Barnett) and Murtogg (Giles New).At 2 hours &amp; 23 minutes, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; is sure to entertain both adults and children alike.  Overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars.  It would not be surprising if the film receives several Oscar nominations, which may include Best Special Effects, Best Art/Set Decoration, Best Costumes and possibly Johnny Depp for Best Actor.	4.0	&quot;Pirate or not this man saved my life.&quot;	2004-01-05	4	4	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1TJPMB7N776WS	MICHAEL ACUNA	"Johnny Depp never ceases to amaze. And he goes way, way over the top in his portrayal of Jack Sparrow in ""The Pirates of the Caribbean."" Dressed and coiffed like the love child of Bob Marley and Madonna and chewing, swallowing and spitting out all the scenery in a performance that reminds me of a bugged out John Barrymore at his twitchy best, he is a marvel to behold. Depp is the antithesis of what any sane person would think of as a normal (whatever that is, by the way) Jean Lafitte type pirate: he prances, he minces about, he's down-an-out, he pouts yet he is a superb fencer and one-on-one fighter and prodigiously physically adept. He's not a wimp by any means just a conflicted man with lots of issues.Orlando Bloom, who seems to be getting the teenage heartthrob marketing build up and is light and photographed as lovingly as Keira Knightley our damsel-in-distress, is effective as Will Turner, the blacksmith with a secret.The only problem with this roller coaster ride of a movie is that it is too long. Gore Verbinski should have known better particularly after his taut directing of last year's ""The Ring.""

Kraeuter ""dolfin1"""	In a summer riddled with sequels here is a movie that brings a fresh breath of sea air to the summer movie screen.  Pirates of the Caribbean meshes a fun script with great acting, well performed action sequences, and the perfect dash of special effects to create something totally original.This script is truly a fantasy and the writers have done a wonderful job creating their own believable legend for us.  They have mixed the the right amount of believability with the unbelievable along with some great one liners and jokes, and the must have love triangle to make this wonderfully fun script.No matter how great the script, if you do not have great actors to put it all together it wouldn't work.  Johnny Depp (Capt. Jack Sparrow) was great to watch on the screen.  He is such a great actor with such great range.  He got you rooting for the infamous pirates who are supposed to be the scourge of the seven seas, the perfect bad/good guy.  His partner in crime, Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) was great, the chemistry between Depp as well as his lady love Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann) was great!  Keira not only filled out her corset well, but she filled her part extremely well.The action scenes where very well done, keeping you on the edge of your seat, but one thing that took this movie to the next level was the great special effects which really filled out the entire story or the curse.It is very hard to put this movie into words, but if I had to describe the movie in one sentence I would have to say; Pirates of the Caribbean is just a fun, wild romp...ahhhhh just go see it for yourself.  Trust me you will like it, so go see it...	5.0	Take a seat and get ready to set sail!	2003-12-13	4	3	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A82LIVYSX6WZ9	Michael Bolts	Pirates Of The Caribbean gives us a high soaring, action adventure in which Johnny Depp (Finding Neverland,Secret Window) in one of his best roles along with Sleepy Hollow since Ed Wood. Depp plays drunken pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlano Bloom (Ned Kelly, Lord Of The Rings Trilogy) plays Will Turner..a blacksmith who has to team up with crazy eyed Depp in order to save his one true love..Elizabeth, played by Kiera Knightley (Love Actually, Bend It Like Beckham), from the hands of the menacing Captain Barbosa..a standout performance for Geoffrey Rush (Ned Kelly, Intolerable Cruelty). Barbosa sails with his crew on the Black Pearl..a ghost pirate ship in which Jack Sparrow was once captain and Barbosa was a part of his crew until Barbosa stranded Sparrow on an island alone..ironically with a little shelter bunker full of bottles of rum. Depp somehow escaped tied seaturtles together using hair from his back (funny). Barbosa is after a legendary treasure chest full of gold, why is because Barbosa and his crew are actually cursed and when the moon touches them they turn into skeletons and the only thing to stop it is if blood is drew from an ancestor of old pirate Bootstrap Turner (lost in Davy Jones' locker) and Will Turner, Bootstraps son is the only key. A extremly well done tale directed by Gore Verbinski (The Mexican, The Ring). Depp brilliantly channels Jack Sparrow with energy to spare for a couple sequels in the making. Also starring Jonathan Pryce (Ronin, Tomorrow Never Dies).	4.0	"""I'm Captain Jack Sparrow!""...Savvy!!!"	2004-11-27	4	2	2
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ALFRWP174NQ73	"Michael Butts ""as i see it"""	One of this year's most talked about and applauded movies, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is a visual wonder, and has some truly outstanding moments, and some quirky performances.  My only problem with it was its length.  It seems to sag in the last half, particularly in the scenes involving the blooding of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom.  By this time, I wanted the movie to speed up and get to the resolution.  The extended swordfight between Geoffrey Rush and Depp, while a marvel of some fine special FX, seemed trite and anticlimactic.  The moonlight transitions were incredibly done, and provided the film's eeriest moments.  There were some great comedic relief scenes, and overall the movie is very, very entertaining.Performance wise, yes, Johnny Depp did add some unexpected foppish flare to his role as Jack Sparrow.  At times, his transition to a more serious character, as on the island with Knightley, were touching.  However, by the time the movie was gearing down, Depp's performance got redundant and tiresome; but Depp proves how diverse an entertainer he can be; his lack of inhibitions in flauncing his role is commendable.Sadly overlooked by many, however, are Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport.  Pryce plays Knightley's austere father with the usual priggishness, but underneath is a happy man who wants his daughter to be happy, too; Davenport plays Knightley's intended, Commandore Norrington, with a true sense of valor, righteousness, and an unexpected sensitivity and regard for not only his love, but his men.  Davenport's is the performance that I feel most Oscar-worthy.  Geoffrey Rush overacts; Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are beautiful, and give solid, if non-sensational, performances.A great movie for entertaining; a point though that sometimes less is more.RECOMMENDED.	4.0	QUITE A RIDE, BUT.....	2003-12-28	1	1	0

Suffice to say that it left this 29 year old quite entertained and engaged throughout its' two-hour plus run.Johnny Depp was amazing.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ	Michael K. Smith	I knew, in a vague sort of way, that this flick had its genesis in one of the rides at Disney World, but since I've never been there, I paid no attention to that. Taken by itself, though, it's a pretty good hour and twenty minutes' entertainment. Johnny Depp, as Capt. Jack Sparrow, a not very prepossessing pirate, chews the scenery heroically. In fact, the Will Turner character, played in the best Errol Flynn fashion by Orlando Bloom, even remarks at one point on Capt. Jack's overacting. And Keira Knightley is a generally believable point of competition among the guys. Of course, if you know anything about ships and sailing (or about Caribbean history, or about British military and naval uniforms, or about pirates . . .), you'll have to put all your objections on hold and view this yarn the way you would a Roadrunner cartoon. I.e., it don't have to make sense, it only has to appeal to adolescent viewers. The swordfighting is well staged, the humor is frequently tongue-in-cheek (I loved Jack's very timely arrival at the dock in the first scene), and the supernatural element is properly hair-turning.	4.0	A fun romp (but hold your accuracy complaints)	2004-08-10	4	3	1

If you don't like Johnny Depp, well you'll still like it! Perfectly loveable and hilarious. The story is about Elizabeth (Keira Knightly), the Governor's daughter, who, when she is ten, finds a boy in the water Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) with some pirate gold around his neck. When he faints she takes it. BIG MISTAKE! That gold happened to be the last of the Aztec gold needed to life the curse of the pirates. The curse basically allows them never to die. Sounds good? Well, not really if you're skeletons at night. Eight years later, when Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), a ruthless pirate - that owns the Black Pearl, that isn't even his ship - finds out, he kidnaps Elizabeth and it's up to Will and Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to save her. Johnny is an adorable, half-mad drunken pirate who appears to be stupid, but he's actually very very clever and witty. He is the rightful owner of the Black Pearl! This is a very funny, film that appears to be simple, but is really clever and well thought out. The graphics are fantastic, and the costumes are breathtaking. Has a very cheesy ending: Elizabeth marries Will, Barbossa dies, and Jack gets his ship back. Aww! One complaint: It had to end! :P	5.0	"""I love weddings!

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	The Walt Disney Company, best known for being one of the premier family-oriented entertainment companies in the world, has experienced a slow-down at the box office with their animated films beginning to lose their edge and their live action fare failing to capture attention for more then one weekend. They have not been as fortunate as other studios as to attach themselves to successful franchises like Warner Brothers has with the Harry Potter series or New Line with The Lord of the Rings. They have become so desperate for a hit as of late that they begun digging through their archives and making some of their more classic live actions features such as Freaky Friday and The Shaggy Dog. But another ploy, that many analysts have taken as a sign of their limited ideas, they have taken up is transforming several of their famous Disneyland attractions into full-length feature films. The company?s first attempt to make the cross-over from tourist packing attraction to box office success story, The Country Bears, was an absolute embarrassment for all those involved. Barely (no pun intended) pulling in $16 million, on a production of $20 million, the film flopped with both the public and the critics. Hoping to bounce back, the second attraction-based feature out of the gate is Pirates of the Caribbean. Pirates is helmed by Gore Verbinski, director of the horror hit The Ring, and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Not only that but it stars Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp with special effects created by Industrial Light and Magic. How could it fail? Quite easily. The pirate genre seems to have been labeled as much a poison to the box office as Al Gore and Michael Moore are to any political figure that gets near them. The latest example comes in the form of Disney last animated flop, Treasure Planet, which failed to recoup even half of its excessive $140 million production budget. And with a production budget just as large, Pirates is yet another big gamble for Disney, only this time they hope to get some luck going for themselves.The story follows the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who seems to be low on his luck. It started nearly ten years prior to where the film starts off when Sparrow?s crew enacted mutiny on his ship and left him deserted on an island in the middle of the Caribbean with only a shotgun and one bullet. Ever since then he?s been moving from one location to the next in search of his stolen ship, the Black Pearl. It is by mere luck (something he desperately needs) that he happens to be captured on the same island where the last piece of cursed treasure resides. What cursed treasure? The treasure of Cortez that was stolen by Sparrow?s mutinous crew, lead by the menacing Captain Barbossa. Unbeknownst to them, the treasure was cursed and unless the treasure is returned, these men will remain the living dead. Though they look human during the day, at night (and in the light of the moon) they turn into grotesque living skeletons. They will be unable to eat, drink, sleep, or even feel until the curse is broken. Will Turner, the skilled blacksmith of the Caribbean town, joins with Captain Jack Sparrow in chasing down Barbossa and his crew who has kidnapped his true love, Elizabeth Turner, the daughter of the town?s governor. But there are far more mysterious reasons for Captain Jack Sparrow to team up with the young Turner that go beyond rescuing Elizabeth. The story for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, even with its consistent lapses in logic and holes in its storyline, is one of the most exciting movies of the year. Considering this is a Jerry Bruckheimer production and his films are not known for their serious conformity, holes in this feature?s storyline should not come as a surprise to anyone. As with such other cult-classic action flicks as The Rock or Armageddon, it is best to ignore these simple misgivings and just enjoy a fantastically well executed action film.The cast of Pirates of the Caribbean has to be one of the most impressive groups of actors and actresses assembled for a Walt Disney Pictures production in the last few years, not only for their star power but the fact that several members have an extensive list of creditable films attached to them which can only help a film of this nature. Johnny Depp, best known for his outlandish performances in Edward Scissorhands and Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, continues his streak of surprising, and more importantly entertaining, roles with his Keith Richards-inspired Captain Jack Sparrow. Though it is rare to say that any picture?s success based on entertainment value relies solely on one performance, Depp?s Captain Jack Sparrow is the definitive highlight of the entire picture. The comedic timing and erratic motions of the character are so perfectly in sync with the entire the picture, while at the same time not distracting attention away from the film?s plot, that no one but Johnny Depp could have pulled off a character like Captain Jack Sparrow as successfully as he does. Orlando Bloom, best known for his role in the Lord of the Rings series, does wonderful job in the role of William Turner. Though there are several prominent questions about the character left unanswered at the end of this film, it is to be understood that they will undoubtedly be revealed in any upcoming sequels that are to follow this film?s success and therefore can be forgiven for the time being. Geoffrey Rush, a well known perform in Australia, is absolutely devilish in the role of Captain Barbossa. He presents both a creepy yet bit charming character that works tremendously well in this film. Keira Knightly, who?s break out performance in the independent flick, Bend It Like Beckham, has garnered the film even more attention, performs well in the role of Elizabeth Swann, the governor?s daughter who isn?t the ordinary ?maiden in distress?, a welcome change from past action flicks of this genre. The only performance in the entire film that seemed out of place was that of Jonathan Pryce?s Governor Swann. Its not that his performance is absolutely unnecessary, its just that he is given little to actually do and fails to really move things along. In fact, he seems to be more of annoyance and should have been scripted better then what was presented in the film.Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is without a doubt one of the best action films of the summer and one of the biggest surprises of the year. Despite lapses in the film?s premise and certain sword fights that don?t go anywhere, Pirates is one of the rare theatrical spectacles that every member of the family can find something about it to enjoy. Those special effect savvy individuals will be astounded by the creative and detailed CGI effects created by Industrial Light and Magic, most notably involving the grotesque skeletons presented throughout the film. The musical score, which, at the last minute, was conducted by Klaus Baldelt, and overproduced by Hans Zimmer, works perfectly with the actions on the screen and truly sets the mood for many of the key scenes. The nearly flawless production, as in the area of entertainment value, does have one outstanding problem which its two hour and twenty minute time length, which makes it seem in the minds of the movie-goers that the filmmakers may be overdoing things a bit.  But based on the children ? if they can stand watching Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets for a longer period of time then this, Pirates? time length should be no problem. Even a squabble here and there, Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the few this summer that be truly, and rightfully, labeled a must-see. Judging by reaction so far to the film, this could easily go down as one of the greatest cult-classic or guilty pleasure films of the year, quite possibly of all-time.	4.0	The Moose Hole - A Pirate's Life for Me!	2003-12-28	1	1	0

THE SCENES MOVE AT A FAST PACE AND THERE IS EVEN A LOVE STORY WOVEN INTO THE FABRIC OF THIS SWASHBUCKLING TAPESTRY.  (KEIRA KNIGHTLY) IS A RAVING BEAUTY WHO PLAYS THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER IN THE MOVIE.  HER LOVE INTEREST IS (ORLANDO BLOOM) A BLACKSMITH WHO JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE PIRATE BLOOD RUNNING THROUGH HIS VEINS.  A FACT THAT EXCITES AND INVITES (KNIGHTLY) TO SEIZE THE MOMENT!

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	"A movie based on a theme park ride??? That's the same question I had (complete with triple question marks) when I heard about ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" but the movie turned out to be far more exciting, charming and fun than any mere carnival attraction could ever hope to be. The story, though of course 100-percent pulp, is involving, and--this being a Disney picture--the special effects are absolutely state-of-the-art. (Without giving away too much of the plot, this movie gives new meaning to the phrase, ""skeleton crew."") Yet as much fun as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is, it would be just another above-average popcorn flick if it weren't for the performance of Johnny Depp as the brazenly witty pirate Jack Sparrow. As played by Depp, Sparrow is made up of equal parts Errol Flynn, David Bowie and Inspector Clouseau; during the course of the movie, other characters call him both ""the worst pirate I've ever seen"" and ""the best pirate I've ever seen,"" and both opinions are eminently defensible. Depp's performance is robust, hilarious, yet delicately nuanced; he gives ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" something you never in a million years would imagine it would have: emotional resonance. Everyone is saying that Depp couldn't possibly score an Oscar nomination for ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" because his is a comic performance in a summer movie. If enough people say it, maybe the Academy will get the message, and nominate him. Beyond Depp's glorious performance, Geoffrey Rush makes a joyous feast of the scenery as Jack Sparrow's archenemy, the black-hearted Captain Barbosa. None of the other actors make a fraction of the impression Depp and Rush do, though Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are appealingly plucky as the young lovers, and it's always nice to see such underrated British thespians as Jonathan Pryce, Jack Davenport and Kevin McNally. Fast-moving despite its 135-minute length and polished to the sheen of a gold doubloon, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a treasure chest of summer movie fun."	5.0	Shiver me timbers!

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1XH3UYZC8DEY5	Milkman	Disney spent millions of dollars producing a movie that looks amazing.  The Caribbean is shown in all its glory... looks so good it could be a travel video.  The costumes are done to a &quot;t.&quot;  The ships look like proper pirate ships.  The battles between the ships are intense and authentic looking.  The special effects are really top drawer.  Skeletal pirates move and fight very convincingly.  Special effects show these skeletons walking across the ocean floor to board their enemies' ship.But after all the millions of dollars spent on the outstanding special effects, the costumes, the ships, and the scenery, you will remember one thing about this movie...How Johnny Depp stole the whole show.He is absolutely fantastic as Captain Jack Sparrow, the quintessential rogue pirate.  Depp played the part like a druken, drug-addled Keith Richards (he even said Richards was his inspiration), and he is hilarious to watch as you realize you can't take your eyes off him.Without Depp this movie would be a three star affair in my book, but with the way Depp soared in this movie I give it a 4.5 out of five.	4.0	Millions of $ spent cannot equal Depp	2003-12-11	14	13	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	When pirates attack the Caribbean town of Port Royal and make off with the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), the young blacksmith who loves her, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom),  enlists the help of an eccentric pirate named Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in tracking them down. The two men set off in pursuit of the dreaded pirate ship The  Black Pearl, captained by a cutthroat named Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). But Jack Sparrow hasn't been entirely candid with his plan to capture the Pearl and save the young lady.Instead of being based on a book or an entirely original screenplay, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; has the unusual distinction of being inspired by the ride at Walt Disneyland. I have to admit, the movie is better than I would have expected a film based on an amusement park attraction to be. Gore Verbinski directs this energetic, fanciful tale of 17th century pirates who terrorize Caribbean seaports. The tall masted ships look good, but the underwater visuals look fake in the extreme. There are lots of battle scenes but very little blood. The story is silly. But the film's great cast keeps us entertained for nearly two and a half hours. Johnny Depp's hilarious histrionic performance as Jack Sparrow alone makes &quot;Pirates&quot; worth seeing. Sparrow's coiffure resembles that of the infamous Blackbeard, but his good-natured humor departs from reality in uproarious fashion. Geoffrey Rush is another heavyweight thespian who has a lot of fun with his villainous character. Orlando Bloom is charming as the earnest and dashing, but unfortunately socially disadvantaged, young heartthrob Will. &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; isn't about anything but frivolous fun, but in that the film accomplishes its mission.I recently read a book about the Golden Age of Piracy: &quot;Under the Black Flag&quot; by David Cordingly. If &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; has piqued your interest in pirate culture, Cordingly's book is an excellent overview of real-life 17th-century pirates, including those in the Caribbean. It includes history of many subjects alluded to in the film: the real town of Port Royal, which catered to pirates, Cort&eacute;s' Aztec gold, the island populations of buccaneers, famous Caribbean pirates, and the general life, times and downfall of the pirates of that era.	4.0	A Swashbucklin' Good Time.	2004-03-10	2	2	0

I loved all of it from the CGI to the sword battles between all the players to the happy ending. Even the booms of cannons and the destruction was all done well.As for Julieta from Boston, pirates were cruel and evil.

Seems ridiculous.  That's partly why Disneys' and Jerry Bruckheimers' $125 million-plus extravaganza ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is such a fun and engaging movie: it comes from something you'd never expect.  Thank goodness though, Disney employed ""Shreks'"" scribes for the screenplay, which is something they had to conjure out of a ride that had no story at all.  But the story they do come up is ripe with creativity, wit and lots of wry and campy humor.  Most of the humor is supplied by the terrific Johnny Depp, who play Captain Jack Sparrow with such, well, wry and campy brilliance.  He, the screenwriters, director Gore Verbinski are what keep the film interesting over its Two and a half hour running time.The plot involves a love story between a blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and a governors' daughter Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly) that plays itself out to another tale of cursed pirates who are searching for the pieces of condemned gold that they looted and and sold.  The pirates kidnap Elizabeth in hopes of lifting the curse, and Will and Jack hijack a British naval warship to find them.  This is where the screenwriters shine.  They fill the script with witty dialouge and easily accessible in-jokes that keep things swashbuckling throughout the whole movie (most of it from the delivery and body languange of Johnny Depp, Bloom and Geoffery Rush as the wicked Captain Barbosa) even when the condemned Pirates come out for a little moonlight and show their true, rotting selves.What also keeps the movie piping along, is director Gore Verbinski.  He keeps the high-flying action-adventure gripping with one impessive action setpiece after another, though not quite as fluently as a Spielberg or a Peter Jackson, but he stills perform exceptionally well.  With a bloated budget like the one he has at his fingertips, what else do you expect?  And how many moves with a huge budget are as fun to watch as ""Pirates of Caribbean?

But their gamble paid off handsomely, and this is due to the collective effort from all involved..Gore Verbinksi with The Ring,The Mexican and Mousehunt to his name, manages to show a very impressive command of this epic (nearly two and a half hours),and give us a very solid and confident direction.Jerry Bruckheimer is a veteran producer who knows a thing or two about the entertaining value of movies.Ted Elliott and  Terry Rossio, succeed in writing a script that is loaded with humour, action and well developed characters, slightly cliched but thoroughly involving. And the humour is relentless, from the 'Evil Dead'-ish skeletons, to the pairing of Mackensie Crook and Lee Arenberg as two hapless pirates.The cast made up of largely British actors, are wonderful, Johnny Depp one of the best American actors today, the great Geoffrey Rush, the smart and classically beautiful Keira Knightley, and of course the scion of British actors, and one of my all time favorites, Jonathan Pryce.The editing contributed a lot to the success of the brilliantly choreographed action scenes.The make up, costumes and locations were well researched and it is obvious that a lot of hard work has been done to achieve this.In short, everyone working on this film contributed their talent and effort to make it the success that it turned out to be.A sequel with the same team is already announced for 2005!!!So Pirates of the Carribean is a thrilling, entertaining and very funny movie,the like of which you rarely see these days..I was not bored and my concentration did not lapse even for a mere second!So fasten your seat belts and buy this movie now, for you will be taken on exciting ride, a much needed escapism full of romance,adventure and humour.	5.0	Fasten Your Seat Belt..and Enjoy The Ride	2003-12-02	5	5	0

Depp's performance is classic (he got an Oscar nomination which is unheard of for this kind of role) and with the next two sequels centered around his character, Jack Sparrow may be his career defining role.

Besides that, this movie combines everything we go to the movies for: romance, adventure, comedy, special effects, a stunningly beautiful young woman and a beautiful pair of men.Which brings me to my second reason for writing this: Johnny Depp. First off I must say that his character (Capt. Jack Sparrow) could have been a bit funny but overall flat, and Mr. Depp brings to life a witty, perfectly crafted, staggering seadog whose charm is impossible to resist. Even the black eyeliner and gold teeth compliment his good looks and it's impossible to resist the devilish twinkle in his eye! Ladies, see it for Johnny!And for those who prefer a more clean shaven version, there is the serious, love driven character of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who will stop at nothing to retrieve his ""bonnie lass"" from the cursed Black Pearl and it's ghastly immortal crew, led by the deliciously evil Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). And of course the fresh, adorable Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) will have every adolescent boy squirming.Overall, this movie combines humor that will have adults and children laughing alike, and although a bit ghostly at times, is not too scary for younger kids. I love Pirates and can't WAIT for the upcoming sequel which is being filmed right now. Happy watching!"	5.0	Pirates of the Carribean	2003-07-26	30	26	4

I watched hers twice before I decided I had to have my own copy. I've watched it several times and I'm still not tired of it. Captain Jack Sparrow as played by Johnny Depp is one of the best characters ever created. No one could have done it better. All the actors were incredible, except for Miss KK. She was quite annoying at times and I think someone else could have given her character more depth.

KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK"""	"I am a big fan of 'Dark Rides' and when I heard they were doing a movie based on one of my favorite attractions at Disney World, I was ecstatic. I didn't see this film in theaters and I must confess I fell asleep on it the first time I viewed it in my home on a 36"" screen TV. I have since built a theater in my basement with a 10' screen and that is where all the ""Pirate"" movies should be viewed!......on a big screen.I watched this film for the second time when 'Dead Man's Chest became available on DVD. I really liked both of these films but, I do not like films that can not be viewed as a whole by themselves. That is the biggest problem with all of these Pirate movies! It's just too much to take in. I watch movies because I want to be entertained for a few hours not rack my brain trying to keep up with a story line that grows bigger and more confusing with each installment.Now that I have watched the third and not likely the last installment I am more confused than ever. I am rating this movie 4 stars because on it's own ""The Black Pearl"" is a fun,rich looking movie dripping with atmosphere. Johnny Depp doing a cool Keith Richards impersonation is at his comedic best! The rest of the cast including Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom are first rate and Keira Knightley is mesmerizing and beautiful.  The 2 disc set is full of goodies and well worth owning. Just remember you have to have a Pirate marathon to really enjoy the whole experience. I will be reviewing all three films as long as my fingers hold up!"	4.0	ENTERTAINING BUT, CURSED!

Though rated PG-13, the movie honestly seems to be rated a bit harshly perhaps in fears that parents would forever link the Disney name with a bit more adult oriented plot.POTC serves up a nice blend of action, adventure and a suprising amount of comedy. Johhny Depp steals the show by submerging himself completely in his character of Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp displays a very comedic sense and yet manages to maintain his believability as a veteran of the seas.POTC should please older audiences with its subtle references to the theme park ride, while displaying enough excitement for the playstation generation. Though the movie is a bit long, it often flows rather well and seldom seems drawn out.POTC is a solid choice for a good summer movie that can be enjoyed by a variety of audiences. While not a candidate for an academy award, it features good acting, a variety of special effects and an mystique not seen in too many action/adventure films since Indiana Jones put the genre back on the map.	5.0	From Someone who has Actually seen the movie	2003-07-09	10	7	3

Starring Johnny Depp as the pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom as Will, the young blacksmith and Keira Knightly as Elizabeth, the governor's daughter, this movie couldn't fail.The story is a simple one. There is a ship, the Black Pearl, formerly owned by Captain Sparrow and now led by an evil captain (Simon Callow) and crewed by pirates cursed never to die until a final piece of stolen gold is returned to its rightful place. Elizabeth has been in possession of this missing gold since she was a girl but never known its significance. When the Black Pearl discovers the whereabouts of this missing treasure they set forth to Elizabeth's home and kidnap her. Soon Will and Jack are in hot pursuit, Will because he loves Elizabeth and Jack because he wants revenge on the pirates who stole his beloved ship from him.Johnny Depp is brilliant as the camp, funny Captain Sparrow (whom he based on Keith Richards of Rolling Stones fame) and he certainly steals the show in spite of worthy performances from the rest of the cast. This, alongside excellent special effects and a myriad of extras (some hidden) on disc 2 make this a DVD well worth purchasing.	5.0	Brilliant family entertainment	2005-05-20	2	2	0

Brando got to do the same in ""The Freshman,"" and Pacino most certainly did ""Dick Tracy.""  Johnny Depp definitely steals center stage as Captain Jack Sparrow as he tries to regain his piratical prominence commanding the Pearl.

It's one of those movies that you wish went on longer, even if it's nearly three hours long. The lack of quiet moments is incredibly refreshing. Even The Fellowship of the Ring dragged a little, and that is one of my favorite movies. It is an incredible risk to make a nearly three hours long movie. Reason #1: People will need more time to see it. (Thereby making them angry if they disliked it. Humans can suffer through an hour and a half of bad jokes and shoddy plots. They cannot stand two hours and fifty-eight minutes of said material.) Reason #2: The quiet moments stick out more. If there are too many of them, the film slows down incredibly. An epic is not an epic without epic battle scenes.Pirates delivers what its premise and hype promise. You are blown out of the water. An engaging pirate movie and Errol Flynn is still dead! Incredible!The DVD seems a good buy because the making of clips in circulation are incredibly encouraging. The potential for hysterical outtakes in this movie is incredible. Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp are constantly perched on outcroppings of one kind or another. They had to fall off sometime. I'd also love to hear a director and screenwriter commentary. There are all these little nods to the ride at Disney World (that I have never seen) and inside nods to how large production companies treat their employees. (Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is a blacksmith's apprentice and makes beautiful swords, yet his often drunken master gets credit for his work.)Johnny Depp is brilliant and enchanting. Even if you've never seen him before, you'll be laughing at his antics and observations.Buy this DVD, but see it in theaters first.

Well, it was a good film indeed, although I have to say the major downfall was Bloom's character.  I won't dispute his acting talent, but the character he played was the same old cliche Disney romantic bumbling bonehead with silly lines and a really comical composition.  Depp's performance was darn good; to play a character who was so out-there, and to do it with style, that takes skills.  Geoffrey Rush makes a great villain, even though the film doesn't do a whole lot to antagonize his character.  And then there's Keira Knightley... she may be the most beautiful girl alive, but she also has acting talent, and unlike many of her colleagues, she doesn't need to rely on her looks to gain her glory.  The less important actors came out with mixed results, but the Commodore and the governor were, sorry to say, not very good.  The music was pretty good, but I think it could've been stronger.  I could just imagine them using the intro to Dimmu Borgir's &quot;Progenies of the Great Apocalypse&quot; (which was done with an orchestra) in the battle scenes!  Anyway, although they had to make Orlando Bloom's character a typical Disney bozo, it really is a pretty good film.

Afterall, Johnny Dep was wearing make-up and looked quite feminine! Did I really want to see this? The answer is a resounding &quot;YES!&quot; Johnny Dep is masterful and creative in the role of Jack Sparrow. Dep created his own style of pirate that made Disney very worried at first. However, those who trusted Dep's genius talked the rest of the Disney crew into letting Dep Jack Sparrow his own way and it was well worth it! Who wants to see another rendition of a boring &quot;Argh matey&quot; pirate? I would far prefer to see the staggering, slurring, yet incredibly agile and ingenius pirate that Dep created.Of course, another draw to the movie is Dep's co-star, Orlando Bloom (Legolas in The Lord of the Rings) as Will Turner. Orlando performs as Dep's straight man, but has comedic lines as well. Bloom does a great job as Will Turner - and looks great as well!Finally, the special effects were top rate - what with pirates turning into skeletons every time the moon's rays hit them.

I really didnt think I would enjoy it at all. I wasn't a fan of Johnny Depp or Orlando Bloom. I'm not someone who generally likes Disney movies. I find them a little predictable and much too moral and pointless. I am also not a great fan of pirate movies.My friend did drag me to the cinema purely because she wanted to see Orlando Bloom. I sat down and laughed from the opening scene to the final cedits.It was an incredable movie.Cap'n Jack Sparrow, the lovable rogue, was hysterical.Orlando Bloom was good in his role as Will Turner, blacksith and pirates son, however I found his character much to righteous, ethical and typically Disney.I believe that casting Johnny Depp in th role of Cap'n Jack Sparrow saved this movie from be just another archetypal Disney movie.

He adds an almost rock star quality to his character of Captain Jack Sparrow.  Just think Keith Richards only younger.  Depp is sarcastic, witty, calm, playful and comical.

A ghost ship the Black Pearl's crew is seeking the last piece of gold and the son of a late pirate in order to reverse the curse they brought upon themselves and one that brings new meaning to the term ""skeleton crew"".

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	An engaging spectacle of mainstream storytelling and action that everyone can enjoy, Pirates of the Caribbean is a real treat.  Based on Disney's theme park ride of the same name, director Gore Verbinski (who helmed the dismal yet surprisingly sucessful The Ring) laces the film with enough action packed scenes to satisfy any action fan, but the true highlight of Pirates of the Caribbean is the standout performance by the always excellent Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, and Depp's performance is worth seeing the film for alone.  Geoffrey Rush's scenery chewing performance as the undead evil Captain Barbosa is a highlight as well, along with lively roles for Orlando Bloom, the comely Kiera Knightley, and Jonathan Pryce.  The swashbuckling stuntwork and superb special effects nicely round out the film, but while Pirates of the Caribbean isn't without it's share of flaws (it is a bit too long for it's own good), it never fails to entertain, and is undoubtadly one of the best films to be released during the summer.  The DVD itself is a work of art, with plenty of extras and features that will please fans of the film.	5.0	Shiver me timbers!!!!	2003-12-16	1	1	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	"Starting in the late 1990's, Disney's theatrical releases gradually lost the popularity and stature they once held.  Outside of Pixar, Disney could not come up with the big blockbusters that they used to produce on an annual basis.  Then came 2003 and the Pirates of the Caribbean.  Coming out around the 4th of July weekend, this movie combines all the essential elements needed for a great movie: good acting, a setting few can ever experience, grand action scenes, unique dialog, hair raising adventure, engaging music and an original story-line.  This movie has it all.First the acting.  Johnny Depp filled this role like no other actor could.  It could probably be said that only he could have played Jack Sparrow, just like only Robin Williams could have played Popeye, or Eddie Murphy played the Nutty Professor.  Rumor has it that Depp modeled the role after Keith Richards of the Rolling Stone.  True or not, Depp also revealed in an interview that some inspiration came from a little-known book ""Sodomy and the Pirate Tradition"".  The cursed pirates of the black pearl provide an entire crew of villains that range from fierce to ridiculous, led by the charismatic and word-wise Barbosa.  And of course we have the romance between Will and Elizabeth.Second is the setting.  Pirate movies are set in America's equivalent of a back yard pool; the Caribbean Sea.  The sets and settings of this movie show of the beauty of the tropical seas and tropical islands.  Whether it be the shipwrecks patrolled by hammerhead sharks of the Isla de Muerta, or the coasts of Port Royal, the vistas in this movie are wonderful.Third is the action scenes.  We have swordfights, chase scenes and great cannon duels.  Of course these have all been done before; i.e. Cutthroat Island.  But computer graphics sure help.  Then there is the storyline.  Loosely based of the Disney ride; the story isn't the regular story of X marks the treasure.  No, the pirates know where the treasure is; returning it all is the goal, along with the blood of an important person.  This makes a combination of pirate lore with great imagination.  Last is the music.  Composed by the same individuals that worked on the music of ""Gladiator"", one can discern similarities between the two soundtracks.  But this is definitely better, and one of the better ones by Disney.  Exciting and rousing, the soundtrack for this movie was probably the 2nd best of 2003 after Return of the King.All in all, a great movie that deserves 5 out of 5 stars.  But the DVD was not as good as it could be.  Specifically, the extra and deleted scenes on the second disc are fully fleshed out; yet they are not included in the movie itself.  For this I give this product 4 out of 5 stars."	4.0	Adventures in the absurd	2006-10-22	5	3	2

Also, there's Geoffrey Rush is THE Pirate. (I even heard him say ARRR!), and the plain badass.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AMNX4BNJMESVM	Nikkiya	"This movie was too well cast to be any less of a rating. Jack Sparrow, er, excuse me, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a down-on-his-luck, fast thinking pirate out to reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl. He bumps aground (or adock?) a Caribbean island where a British colony resides including childhood friends, Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). As children, Elizabeth helped rescue Will from the ocean but she swiped a medallion he wore around his neck in the process. The medallion, unbeknownst to Elizabeth holds many secrets for which a group of pirates will stop at nothing to own it. These just happen to be the same pirates in control of the Black Pearl under Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Rush makes the crucial element to the movie -- a good BAD GUY -- ""I decline to acquiesce to your request... means NOOO.""It's a true ""swashbuckling"" adventure with plenty of good lines, plot twists, and high sea battles between good and bad. The special effects are terrific as is the acting. The movie is definitely reminescent of the Disneyland ride for those wondering (if you haven't seen one or the other). Some critics did not like this movie but not all good things come in perfect, neat packages. Being a clever pirate doesn't typically fall into that category, and I enjoyed not being able to predict how the movie was going to end."	5.0	Arrrrgh, Pirates!	2004-08-31	2	1	1

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	Oh, pardon me...but I remember a time when Disney films used to inspire Disneyland theme park attractions - NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND! &quot;The Pirates of the Carribean&quot; is a convoluted tale with Johnny Depp at its helm. It's based (loosely) on the Disney theme park attraction that's been around since the mid-1950's. It's basically a sea epic, with a ton of digital effects and some good bits of comedy (again - directly gleaned from the Disneyland ride; the bit with the pirates in prison, trying to con a dog with the keys to their cell, is just one of the direct rip offs from the ride)but over all - and this must be said - &quot;The Pirates of the Carribean&quot; lacks in originality and the swell of overwhelming good fun that 'classic Disney adventures'- like &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; had.TRANSFER: There's good news here. A rich, solid DVD picture with bold colors, fine detail throughout, excellent contrast and shadow levels and minimal digital distractions - all add up to a really fine visual presentation. The digital effects are 'obviously' digital but hey, I seem to be the odd ball this way; I prefer a more real-looking film experience to something that looks like it came from a comic book. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced.EXTRAS: A making of, some junket stuff, the theatrical trailer and some interviews.BOTTOM LINE: I didn't like the film. The transfer, however, is stunning...and hey, in light of the fact that Eddie Murphy is currently starring in another Disney theme park rip off - &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot;, can &quot;It's A Small World&quot; be coming to a theater near us soon?	4.0	NOT SURE I LIKE THE DIRECTION DISNEY'S GOING IN!	2003-12-25	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A33TBHM3O9AY17	No one of consequence	"I admit I was a little skeptical when I was first considering whether to watch this movie, but watch it I did ... and was amazed!  This one easily ranks among the best movies I have ever seen, mainly because it blends a wide range of elements in a way that appeals to nearly every conceivable sector of the viewing public -- and does so without seeming strained or contrived.  Quite the opposite is true, in fact.  There is a smooth flow to the storyline and character development, although admittedly neither is especially deep.The story centers on the quest of the cursed pirates of the ship ""The Black Pearl"" to recover a treasure that caused their curse.  They need to restore it to its resting place, accompanied by a blood sacrifice (the ""girl"" in the story) to lift the curse.  Meanwhile our hero, the pirate Jack Sparrow (um, that's ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow, if you please), wants both The Black Pearl and the treasure, but for his own reasons (not the least of which is revenge against the Pearl's crew for marooning him).  Against this basic backdrop, the story will lead the viewer on a merry chase around the Caribbean, with many great twists and turns along the way.The film combines action, comedy (dare I say even a tiny dash of slapstick?), romance, history, suspense, and even some creepy supernatural stuff.  At the same time, it manages to leave out things like strong language, sexual content, or excessive violence and gore.  Although some of the scenes include some violence and blood, neither is likely to be objectionable to most viewers.  I felt perfectly comfortable letting my kids (ages 11 and 7) watch this with me -- in short, a family-friendly affair.But of course, the best part of the movie was Johnny Depp in the lead role as Jack Sparrow.  This is absolutely a masterful performance, as Johnny plays this foppish rogue who is at once witty, charming, irksome, comical, and seemingly innocuous but in fact rather dangerous to those who cross him.  His speech is colorful and even a little flowery, but always with a slight slur that makes you wonder if he hasn't been lingering over the rum a little too long.  And Johnny Depp pulls off every bit of this role in a way that I think very few others could -- you can't help but love this character.In short, this is a wildly entertaining movie for just about anyone who wants to be entertained.  It has something for everyone and is, in a word, just plain fun.  There's a good reason this one's a bestseller.  I urge you to find out for yourself.  I'll be adding this movie to my personal library very soon."	5.0	This movie has it all.  Johnny Depp at his best!	2003-12-02	1	1	0

I was really surprised at how true Disney kept the story to the Disney World ride - while still keeping it a great movie.Jerry Bruckheimer is the producer of this action-packed-hilarious movie starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly.The story:When the daughter of the Govenor, Elizabeth, is kidnapped by cursed pirates of the infamous Black Pearl ship, it is up to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) the blacksmith, son of a pirate who is in love with Elizabeth, and Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) the quirky and eccentrically charming pirate with a grudge, to save her. What none of them know, however, is that the Black Pearl and the entire crew are cursed forever as the undead (they look like regular people during the day, but are revealed as skeletons by the moonlight - and they can not be killed) and the only thing that can break the curse is the blood of the son of the man who bestowed the curse upon them - the blood of Will Turner.The effects in this movie are amazing! I was blown away! The action scenes and sword fighting is superb, never a dull moment. The acting is spectacular!! Especially by johnny Depp - Captain Jack Sparrow. His blend of Keith Richards and Pepe La Pue are absolutely hilarious and mesmorizing! You can not take your eyes off of him!!This is a movie that is great for the whole family - adults and kids (although I don't recommend for very young children who might find some scenes scary, and some are slightly violent)there are over 10 hours of special features on this DVD:19 Deleted and Alternate scenesBlooper ReelAudio Commmentary with Gore Verbinski and Johhy Depp and with Jerry Bruckheimer and Keira Knightley and Jack DavenportAn Interactive history of pirates&quot;Diary Of a Pirate&quot;&quot;Diary of a ship&quot;Producers photo diary with Jerry BruckheimerWalt Disney's Wonderful World of Color&quot;Fly On The Set&quot; FeaturettesMoonlight Serenade Scene ProgressionImage GalleriesENHANCED COMPUTER FEATUREs:Moonlight Becomes Ye effects studioDisneyland Pirates Virtual reality viewerDead Men Tell No Tales - The History of the attractionPirates of The Caribbean attraction image galleryScriptscannerStoryboard viewerSpecifications:DTS 5.1 Digital Surround SoundTHX-Certified with THX OptimizerDolby Digital 5.1 Surround SoundWidescreen (2.35:1) - Enhanced for 16x9 Tv'sFrench language track and subtitlesRated: PG-13Approx. 143 minutesHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!	5.0	The BEST movie of 2003!	2003-12-23	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3E0MSKBIWMU6F	obryanstars	I recently saw Pirates of the Carribean, and while its no Lord of the Rings, it was definantly worth the [$] dollars I paid to see it.  Here's what I thought of Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl, starring Orlando Bloom.1) Story: Excellent!  The movie had an excellent plot.  The story revolves around a cursed ship called the Black Pearl, and it's crew of Pirates, bent on finding every last piece of Aztec Gold!The story begins with a young girl named Elizabeth Swan, who has a powerful father (the governor of England).  They live a life of luxery, under the protection of the British Navy.  She is young, beautiful, and weary of someone to love her.  Yet the only person she really cares for is a young Blacksmith, Will Turner (played by Orlando Bloom).  A few days later, the island is raided by the legendary Pirates, aboard the Black Pearl.  Yet they are after only one thing: the last piece of Aztec Gold, and the blood of the one who has it!  They take Elizabeth (the one who had it), and head away to end the horrible curse.  Will, knowing that Elizabeth's life depends on his actions, decides to go after her!  Yet the only person who knows where the Black Pearl is headed, and is skilled enough to catch it, is the heroic Jack Sparrow.  Together, these 2 unlikely people are paired together, to save Elizabeth, get some gold, and live the life we've all dreamed of...to live a Pirates Life at Sea!Belive me, the story gets much more complicated as you head in, and to go any deeper would give away the plot.  Excellent story!2) Acting: The Acting is done to perfection, with the griddy and crude Pirates, the Proud Military, and the true love shared by Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan.  And there is no one like Jack Sparrow, as Johny Depp plays the role to perfection.  A crazy, yet heroic Pirate, who has his own reasons for going after the Black Pearl.  Orlando Bloom plays another incredible role as Will Turner, as he is once again the quiet, kind, and caring hero that was played so well in Lord of the Rings (Legolas the Elf in case you've been under a rock).Great acting, great story, great movie!3) Scenary: Perfect!  What can I say, Disney did incredible.  You really got the feeling of a sixteenth century world, the freedom, the danger, and the true wild sense of life.  Everything was great, the scenary included.  The costumes were excellent, the ship was better than average, and the towns were done about as well as you could think possible.  A great movie, nothing holding back here.Overall, this was an excellent movie.  It had a great plot, acting, scenary, and overall depth that you don't see in most movies.  It was believable, funny, and really drew you in to this world.  It had an excellent plot, it had you cheering and caring about the characters, and like so few movies ever do, you really felt like the characters were living breathing people, and that a real sword battle could be going on somewhere in the Carribean as you were watching.Great movie, definatly worth you six bucks at the Theater.  If you like action-packed romance (example: Spider-man), this is a must-see movie.  This film grossed over Two-hundred Million Dollars for a reason.  It was funny, action packed, and really drew you in.  5 stars! Definantly reccomended*Thx!	5.0	A Very Good Movie! Romance, humor, and a TON of action!	2003-08-17	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1YFV69R44MJP4	"Paige Souza ""degobasystem"""	"It thoroughly surprises that so many critics disliked this movie. Rolling Stone gave it only 2 stars, Roger Ebert said that it outstayed it welcome and had pointless fight scenes. After seeing all these bad reviews I had to wonder, did they watch the same movie that I did?Pirates of the Caribbean was a great movie. It had everything an engaging, fun, summer movie should have. It had action, suspense, humor, drama, a little bit of romance (not so much that it would make you sick) and even a bit of horror and mystery. I have to agree that it was a long film, but it was engaging from beginning to end. I never felt bored at any point.The main reason why this film was so wonderful was because Gore Verbinski combined a great story with great actors, thus displaying some great acting. Mr. Rush portraying the character of Captain Barbosa displays the polished skills of a prominent, talented actor. He embodied the character completely and his performance draws you into the setting making you feel as if you are a part of the story. Johnny Depp is absolutely hilarious and gives us some of the more memorable scenes of the movie. I believe this might be his best performance yet. Both Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are good in their roles as well. But don't take my word for it, go out and see it for yourselves. Don't listen to the critics because in reality, it is just one person's opinion. You all have a mind of your own, don't rely on someone else's. See it just for all the scenes that are related to the ride or see it for the pirate dialogue that is spoken flawlessly from Depp and Rush, to some of the minor supporting characters.So what is all the criticism about, I still really haven't figured that out. One reviewer in Rolling Stone online said that everyone should go out to a bar and get drunk instead of seeing this movie because it would achieve the same effect. To this comment I have to reply, ""I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request. Means no."" Savvy?"	5.0	So much criticism for such a great movie	2003-08-05	2	0	2

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A25BGV46BKHIX8	"Pamela R. Heath ""writer"""	"Let me just say one thing up front. I didn't want to see this film.  I don't like pirate movies.  I wasn't particularly a fan of Johnny Depp.  However, a friend insisted that I see ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" and I went, moaning, groaning, and dragging my feet all the way.  So, the moral of the story is (for all you people who are skeptical and haven't yet seen this wonderful film) to keep an open mind.This movie blew me away. First of all, Johnny Depp was amazing. I've never seen a performance that could equal his. You can't take your eyes off of Depp to even appreciate the other fine acting in the film unless you've watched the movie several times! Secondly, I liked the plot twists. It is rare that I watch a film and miss any of what is going on. I did with this film, and had to watch it several times in the theatre to understand precisely what was happening, and just how incredibly clever Captain Sparrow was.  Furthermore, watch the subtle shifts in Depp's performance when he's with people or alone. There's a clear difference.  Sparrow is far more focused, thoughtful, and decisive alone.  He's putting on a hypnotic act when in front of others.  It's a one man acting tour de force, awesome to watch.  Third, I was on my college fencing team and have always been really picky about the swordplay in a movie. There have been some great sword fights in the past, most recently in ""The Princess Bride,"" but the consistency and quality of the sword play in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was highly impressive.  Some critics complained about too many sword fights, but I loved each and every one of them. They were terrific. Finally, the music and cinematography were wonderful, adding greatly to the overall impact of the film.  I consider it this year's best movie par none so far.It's hard to come up with enough superlatives to describe this movie.  I predict that this film will become one of the true family classics, like ""The Princess Bride"" was. It is equally enjoyable for children and adults, and is entertaining no matter how many times you've seen it. The commentary (including Depp), bloopers, and deleted scenes make this DVD a clear must-have.  My only wish is that, like ""The Lord of the Rings"" DVDs, they would come out with an extended version of the movie."	5.0	An absolute classic	2003-09-12	0	0	0

It was only when I recently bought it on DVD however that I remembered exactly how much I loved it. I have owned it for about a week or so and I have watched it every single day. I never do this with movies. Ever. I get bored easily. The reason for this madness? Reason has nothing to do with it.Firstly, the script isn't just beginning, middle, end. Each character has a background and story to them, even if you don't find out that much about it. This makes it more...well, not real, but as close as you can get in a movie like this. You could make a movie on each character. That said, the actual plot is genius, with twists and turns and I still can't believe it's two hours long. The time flies when you watch it.Ah the characters. Johnny Depp steals the show, no question. I've loved JD since I saw Edward Sissorhands and I think this Captain Jack Sparrow is the best character he has ever played. Kiera Knightly, Geoffery Rush and Orlando Bloom are all equally excellent, each playing their part to the hilt. Even the cast extras are pure gold.Action, Adventure, Romance, Comedy, Eyecandy, Great soundtrack, great graphics...It is everything a movie should be and more. I can't find enough words to share my enthusiasm.On a DVD exras note: This is well worth the extra dinero. There is a feast of bonus stuff that will keep you amused for hours. There's even a bit where it takes you through the original ride.Buy it. Spread the Pirate-y goodness. This movie is a thing of beauty.	5.0	What Obsession feels like	2003-12-16	2	2	0

He suggested ""Pirates"".From the very beginning, this was a movie that drew me in. I genuinely wanted to see what came next and how the characters were going to get out of each situation.Although, I was immediately distracted by Keira Knightley's facial expressions. Whether she was laying in bed or fighting pirates, she looked like she had a ""dip"" tucked away in her bottom lip. I really found this to be very very distracting.Otherwise, I won't go into great detail because there are some very thorough reviews on the board already, but I would say that this movie did for me what few movies do.. it made me forget about time and life and the outside world completely. When I walked out of the theater I was surprised that it was still daylight and felt a bit dazed. Pirates had taken me on a 2.5 hour ride and had kept my full attention the entire time.Johnny Depp does a great job. I think this is his best role ever. My thought is that he is so used to playing pretty boy parts that sometimes they come out a little shallow.. but in Pirates he is definitely not a pretty boy and seems to have totally let go and just played the role from his heart (and his funny bone). I wonder how much of it was ad libbed and how much was actually in the script. I found him to be completely witty and charming.As it turns out this was a perfect movie for me and my son to watch together. The movie included romance without making me uncomfortable or giving me things to have to explain later.

The plot is secondary to Depp's vamping and camping around the place, but still, it's a good plot: an adventure quest to recapture the good ship Black Pearl, a ghost ship taken over by Geoffrey Rush (he plays his part exceptionally well, too; but no one can compete with Depp, who completely and unashamedly steals the show), a mutineer who is desperately seeking Susan - no, that's another movie...desperately seeking to reverse an ancient curse that has reduced him and his mangy crew to live as skeletons in the nether world of the eternally undead.

First off, Keira Knightly was NOT a saving grace to this movie. There is no need for a saving grace, as this is one of the best movies to come out, EVER! Boring, dumb? Yeah if you are a loser who is so badly into special effects like the Matrix that you are so close-minded about every other movie. Matrix is a great movie btw, but anyways...to be totally ignorant would be to say that the acting and writing sucks. What kind of movie-goer are you? You have no place to say in the matter, as your taste in movies is total garbage. Orlando Bloom is a great actor in this movie but Johnny Depp steals the show.People go to watch this movie simply because they are intelligent movie-goers unlike n bruce. they have good taste in movies. oh yeah you can just assume that people only like it because there are hot characters and that's it. You don't KNOW a thing, you only think you do. Frankly YOU are the one that is a shallow poop head. And a hypocrite as well, I know for a fact that you believe Kiera is the only good one simply because you believe she is hot (and true, she definitely is) People went to see this movie because it's a great movie, so deal with that fact like a man.You just do not seem to get it through your thick brainless skull, n bruce, that this movie DOES have substance no matter what you say. Yeah and you say people who like this movie are dumb, that's a definite example of the pot calling the kettle black. You should take a look in the mirror yourself but it would probably crack from the overloading waves of utter stupidity.If you are a complete moronic waste of movie-goer space like n bruce you will not like this movie and create reviews about it when your opinion isn't really worth beans to begin with. People like n bruce do not deserve to go to movies, or to procreate either.In short, get a life n bruce, shut the hell up, and go back to watching your precious Gigli.	5.0	Great movie no matter what any dumbarse says	2004-12-23	3	1	2

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3V61K0EF38GP4	Philip Scholz	No matter how many Pirates of the Caribbean movies have come out and no matter how many everr will come out, this one will always be the best.  I often find myself wondering if the idea for at least the original trilogy had already been in place when this film was being made or if it was concieved after this film's success at the box office.  Sadly, I'm leaning in favor of the latter scenerio.  But again, this film was awsome and deserves all the praise and sequels it can get.  As anyone can probably guess, Johny Dep's Jack Sparrow stole the show, even when he wasn't in a scene.  Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom were also great, though I think Ms. Knightley was more lively...maybe that's because she plays second fiddle to Jack Sparrow, knows it, and wants to live up to the honor.  Well Ms. Knightley, your effort paid off.  I have never heard of Geoffrey Rush before (sorry to admit that), but his performance as the villainous Hector Barbossa was another effort that paid off.  Mr. Rush, I happily place you up among the likes of Anthony Hopkins and Heeth Ledger...well done, Sir, well done.  Overall, this film did not make a single mistake when it came to casting.  Furthermore, the set pieces were thenominal, putting us right in that time period.  You'll just about forget you're simply watching a movie.  I don't know if this film will ever be released in a 3-D version, but I don't care.  This film has plenty of realism and 3-D for me.  Enjoy.	5.0	It Will Always Be The Best!	2014-03-06	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3FXDPAGCL931G	Pierre Gouin	In a Disney all-family film were no skin (but lots of bones!) is ever shown - which is rather ludicrous in a tropical setting - Jack Sparrow seems to be as jolly and gay as they come. While he battles with young and cute Will Turner, he shows the greatest interest in the youth and takes great care not to wound him, making the encounter last much longer than needed. Before, Jack had not the slightest interest in Elizabeth, the beautiful young girl he just saved from the waters. Later, standing alone on a lost island with that georgous girl, Jack seems attracted only to bottles of rhum. In fact, every few times he meets a woman he knows, she slaps him violently on the face, apparently for unknown manly promesses he did not properly fulfill.Cap'tain Sparrow has a detached way of dealing with people (except his curteous sympathy for the handsome Will) and things, which he shows by his swaying way of walking and precious sharp-tongued talking which makes him the undisputed Queen of the Carribean. Jack actually appears wearing a crown at the end of the film!Although Orlando Bloom is utterly handsome and sympathetic (however less inspiring than in his Legolas character), Johnny Depp - who has a long story of complex and outcast characters - easily steals the show. He is absolutely perfect in showing in every way, humour, looks, clothing, heavy mascara, rings and a pronounced taste for jewels, the ambiguous and androgynous personality of unforgettable Jack Sparrow.This DVD looks absolutely stunning on a 16:9 widescreen TV, however this film is worth seeing mostly for Johnny Depp's performance. Happily enough the clever and handsome actor appears almost in every scene. Bravo Johnny!	4.0	Jack, Queen of the Carribean	2004-01-11	1	1	0

Not only it has created two sequels (the third one is not out yet) but there are loyal funs of the series and it has made DisneyWorld convert their pirate ride into a Johnny Dep inspired ride.The movie itself is benefited by a superb plot, great visual effects and great acting. What is even more important the actors seem to actually enjot themselves and they do not take thamselves too seriously which adds to our entertainment.

But it turns out, unfortunately, that this is a typical Disney movie, with the typical Disney humor.  Complete with the two stupid bad guys, the dumb British old guy plus (new & improved!) the dumb British young guy, flawlessly beautiful, haughty heroine, and Orlando Bloom as the hero.  I couldn't help laughing aloud to see that scrawny Bloom playing the part of a blacksmith's apprentice - !  The fact that the heroine gets stranded on a deserted island with a drunk pirate captain and presumably manages to avoid being raped also bothered me.  It seems to me that the movie makers were most interested in the horror aspect of the film, which was interesting but totally sensational and, I thought, redundant.Johnny Depp's performance was great, of course, but it couldn't save the movie.  The soundtrack is very enjoyable.  I'd rather listen to it than watch the movie.	1.0	Typical Disney work	2005-04-21	26	6	20

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ACMAUJEBY6GJF	Pl Amundsen	"...(and already a classic it seems) is the special effects, the THX-sound, and acting of Johnny Depp bringing life to a highly peculiar pirate (and well done so). The story has its' moments I admit, but personally I don't get the hype here. Opinions can be many, I realize, and it's a visually well-functioning adventure-movie with several of Hollywoods' ""hot"" act/ors/tresses (and with Johnny Depp on top I guess), but I think Orlando Bloom is the worst action-actor ever (he was ok in his feminine elf-suit when he played ballerina in the ""Lord of the Rings""-triology), but he gives overacting an entirely new meaning. And I find him simply annoying. He does not deserve to play lead next to the legendary Johnny Depp. Not that I am in awe with him and all his work (Depps' I mean), but the man certainly knows how to act and was the only joy to watch in ""Pirates..."". Him and G.Rush perhaps. The camera-work and special-effects iare indeed appealing, and the story has its' moments as mentioned -but it's not that amazing. People call this a masterpiece, and the most fantastic adventure-movie ever -but having seen it twice, and getting a bit bored the second -well, I have to say I disagree. ""Pirates..."" is ok. Average big-budget movie that does not inspire. The story is a bit too ""modern"", it's like ""Lethal Weapon"" on waves. Orlando Bloom should have been used as shark-bait, and I expected it to be funnier -of course Depp is the clown of the show here, but too much dialogue is wasted on things we've heard thousands of times before. Like the scene where those guards starts to argue over two ships and forget they are dealing with a pirate (the Depp-character in the beginning of the movie when he has just arrived the place where later the ghost ship attacks). That scene was just embarrasing, but on the other hand -it is Disney and ment for the children too...This is simply a reaction of yet another overrated movie, no big deal of course -and people certainly have a right to've enjoyed it."	3.0	The best things about this movie...	2005-08-29	3	0	3

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ATXEWSQJC2LVT	"P. M. Mccaffrey ""PM-24-7"""	"I thought that this movie could stand on it's own (even though it was based on the Disney rides). It seemed like the Disney people gave the creators free reign in making the movie and just requested that a few key elements be added...(ie-scenes like the pirates whistling at the dog from the inside of a jail cell in an attempt to coax the dog to give them the key and placement of the songs from the ride). At times the placement of these key scenes and songs made you cringe because they seemed to take away from the movie, but, atleast the you can understand how they were trying to tie things together.The comic relief provided by Depp's character (Captain Jack Sparrow) was what kept the movie going and helped to keep pessimistic viewer interested.Is it worth seeing in the theater- YesWould I see it in the theater again- No...the movie did seem to drag on and the near 2-1/2 hours spent in the theater makes a return visit unlikely.The movie was a nice surprise. The hype behind the movie was justified because, aside from the ride tie-ins it seemed like Disney kept their ""perfect world"" editing hands off of the film and let the pirates stay true to their nature."	4.0	Doesn't disappoint, but doesn't blow you away either.	2003-07-11	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1TAWJ2PA3USVX	"P. M Simon ""El Simon Asombroso"""	"`Pirates of the Caribbean' is a mixed-bag of a film.  If you just want some fun and don't mind a moronic plot and some mediocre performances, this might be a great film.  In fact, it is possible that the silly plot and too-relaxed performances are genius.  They might be director's style.  After two watchings, I haven't yet decided.  Johnny Depp is certainly the main character, as Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow.  He plays a Kieth Richards knock-off; androgynous and with too much kohl under the eyes, he goes around like a man on a triple Quaalude overdose. Since he has all the good lines, this is actually probably deathly witty, rather than deathly dull.Yes, the film is based on a Disneyland ride, so did you expect a Shakespearean plot?  No, and at least the silly plot has great effects.  Geoffrey Rush is also likeable as the pirate Barbossa, complete with all his clich&eacute;s including the animal familiar and the ""arrr, arr, arr"" stuff.  Truth be told, he sounds like the old salt on 'The Simpsons.'On the other hand, Orlando Bloom is so low-key as to be genuinely dull as the too-sincere young man who needs to discover his pirate roots.  And Jonathan Pryce, one of the greatest actors alive, is wasted in a smallish, poorly-played role as the British Colonial Governor.So, a mixed review and a gut feeling that this is probably a film you need to see for yourself.  If you don't like the film, at least the ""making of"" feature on the extra disc is uproariously funny!"	3.0	You'll Either Love it or Hate It	2005-09-02	4	2	2
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AB1UMC7SB9D7Z	"PolarisDiB ""dibness"""	"Everybody likes pirates! (Well, not the music industry, but whatever...)Johnny Depp shines as Captain Jack Sparrow, a cleverly klutzy pirate who is in search for the Black Pearl and the crew that mutinied it from him.  Leader of the mutineers is Captain Barbossa, a mean dirty pirate with a curse that sends him searching for the pieces of some ancient Aztec gold... and the blood of a good pirate's son.It also involves a side story about that young son (Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom) and the love of his life (Elizabeth Swann, played by Keira Knightley), but nobody cares.Honestly, Johnny Depp MADE the movie.  His perfect characterization of a quirky swashbuckler is both funny and memorable.  His personality and charisma shines from screen to screen as he tries to figure out how to get what he wants when everybody else seems to be against him.Depp by himself, though, would have made for a strained and bad movie indeed.  Even a good actor with a good character can be dire and silly in a movie that doesn't compliment them.  Thus we have Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa, the driven evil that compliments Depp's Sparrow well.  Rush obviously had a lot of fun with the role and it's a real joy to see him, especially when working off of Depp.It also has some pretty good dialog, stuff to make you laugh in between action moments.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2CMYX10636NG2	Portia	"I went to this movie for the rare treat of spending 2 and 1/2 hours (a LONG time for a Disney movie, huh?!) ogling BOTH Johnny Depp AND Orlando Bloom (what more could a girl ask for?!) and came out impressed with how fabulous this movie was all by itself!Of course, it would be greatly diminished without the hilarious and screen-stealing performance of Depp as a quirky caricature of a pirate and gorgeous Orlando Bloom as a kind-hearted blacksmith who is the son of a famous pirate himself. Keira Knightly, who still looks exactly like Natalie Portman no matter what else she's done since The Phantom Menace, is an excellent damsel-not-in-distress (and is a much better actress than Portman...obviously).The special effects are, well, mind blowing. The guys turning into skeletons in the moonlight was awesome. I didn't know we could DO that! I'm sure the effects will be outdated by the time this film is released on DVD, but they're subtle enough to not distract from the rest of the movie's charm. The whimsical set and Disneyish tendancy to play up all of the traditional stereotypes for pirates (missing eyes, gold teeth, parrots, affinity for saying ""aaraarrrr!"", etc) keeps the feel of the film very lighthearted and slightly ""spoofy"". This movie knows that it's fantasy, AND, above all, is based on an amusement park ride. It is here to amuse.Lots of EXCELLENT fight scenes and some great humor, especially from Depp's character. Of course, the bad guys are all good guys at heart and the pirates win at the end. (OOps, here's a spoiler!!): Knightly naturally chooses sexy piratey Bloom over stiff red-coat boyfriend officer-guy (I mean, who WOULDN'T?!)... but the violence isn't too gruesome and the scary bits won't scare anyone over 10 or 12 I shouldn't think.Also, the surprising length (2 1/2 hrs!!) isn't too long at all...

Yes, I was going just for him, even if the movie bombed. What can you expect? I'm only 13! (A good thing for the movie, however, as boytoys from both generations were pulling in the female audience.) I mean, whom else did I know, or care, who were in it? Johnny Depp was alien to me, being as he was in his peak of fame before I could speak, maybe even before I was born. Geoffry Rush was just another name. I couldn't see why they were anything special.But wow, `Pirates of the Caribbean' was a blast. My friend told me, beforehand, that it had everything, and I responded, `Whatever. It has Orli.' I can see what she meant though.Action- the sword-fighting, defense against the ghosts, and their sweet getaway from right under the commadore's nose. It has a lot, but this is a pirate movie, and I doubt anyone is going to act as if the massive amount of action/violence is a surprise.Romance- Will and Elizabeth... you know they're going to hook up, after all, this IS Disney, home of happy endings. But, hmm, might as well throw Jack slightly coming onto her to add a little disturbance in the destined relationship. (Remember his departure, where he's `sorry lass. It would have never worked out' between them?) [I like commenting on everything, and I just would like to say, before they inevitably kiss at the end, Will is wearing this really ornate hat, and to those who can't stand end-of-the-movie kissing, it's a little funny to see how he was going to kiss her with that huge hat on!  I said to my best friend: 'He's going to knock her into the ocean with that hat, or poke her eye out.' Then she takes it off. 'Ooooh...' :-D Just a quirk.]Humor- (This is a major topic.) An omnipresent element that MUST be there if you're bringing the kids. Lucky for us, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow serves it straight to us, humor even the kiddlers would enjoy. (A conversation while dueling, which, in itself, is funny: `I practice... with them... 3 hours... a day!' `Lad, you need a woman') Even the slightest facial expression or body movement is pure hilarity with Depp. Sometimes it could be his comments, the fact that he cares about the little things when he could be killed, as shown when the executioner leaves out the `Captain', or when his beloved Black Pearl is getting bombed. Whatever it is, it's laughter-laced with it shining through at the most unlikely situations. It's like the best Belgium chocolate with a side of a Starbucks.Suspense- There's just a slight salt's shake of suspense, but enough. Will he, or will he not, be captured by pirates and killed? What happens to Elizabeth? Poor blasted Black Pearl, how will Jack sail it now?Special FX: Wow. The way the crew of the undead changed between fleshy to skeleton is awesome, also when Barbossa and Jack are having their face-off, literally, their faces, plus every other flesh and ligament on them, comes off. But really, more than that, it was an asset that made the movie so more worthwhile.Mystery- Why exactly do they need Elizabeth? This is addressed half way through the not TOO long movie, but I don't know if I've spoiled enough already! Now more of the mystery is something you'll have to uncover yourself!The plot was that a crew of cursed pirates needed the last coin and pirate blood (they can't bleed, see?) to be put in a gold chest and make them human again. They capture Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly), who they believe to be the person they need the blood from. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) seeks help from Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who replies, (this is my favorite line) `If you spring me from this cell, I shall TAKE ye to yer bonnielass.' I must congratulate Depp for being such a convincing pirate; appearance, attitude, accent and all. Moving on; Jack wants the Black Pearl, his old ship, but it's been captured by Barbossa (Geoffry Rush) and crew, so by helping Will, he's also helping himself reclaim his baby. See how it all comes together? `Pirates' is bound to give you an ache for more, if you allow yourself to be taken by the movie magic. Yay for sequels then! Though I hadn't seen the trailer for it, I definitely will be back with an even larger group of friends.	5.0	An awesome mix of every crucial movie element, plus more	2003-07-24	0	0	0

Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow is iconic and will go down in movie history as a classic role.  Orlando Bloom is suitably dashing as Will Turner (interesting pun of a name) and Keira Knightly gives a starmaking turn as the lovely, tough as nails Elizabeth Swann.  No less formidible are the acting chops of Geoffrey Rush as the creepy, hideous, evil, and somehow charming pirate Barbossa. Director Gore Verbinski has a great eye for scenery and a wonderful instinct for giving actors room.  The movie is paced perfectly, and hits all the high notes at all the right moments.  Surprising, refreshing, and altogether witty, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is excellent family entertainment, but has enough of an edge to avoid the ""nerdy"" tag so feared by teens. (Honestly, I'm not sure why it earned the PG-13 rating, rather than PG.) The DVD package is excellent with many interesting and worthwhile extras that provide some fun insights into this project."	5.0	Perfect performances, perfect tone	2004-08-21	6	4	2

Who says that Pirate movies Stink??? this one banishes that theory and then some :)Orlando Bloom is AWESOME - endearing and sweet as the goldsmith, and swashbuckling at it's best!! WOW!! 1st Bow and Arrows and now Sword fighting.. had me cheering throughout the movie.Johnny Depp - had a major flashback of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", but very comical he is so hilarious as Captain Jack Sparrow such a well rounded actor I continue to enjoy his performances.Geoffrey Rush - Excellent in his portrayal of Barbossa I could go on for days let's just say it was well worth the money.The plot is woven so well that by the time the end comes you have no unanswered questions. Special Effects of the ghost/skeletons (in the moonlight) to living humans are FANTASTIC!! I was on the edge of my seat during some of the scenes and cheered when the girls got to kick butt too! The music was cool the costumes looked ""just right"", location was Beautiful (St. Vincent here I come) this movie was everything you would expect from a good Disney flick it kind of reminded me of ""Hook"" *BUT MUCH BETTER* had the witty humor, enough smart sword fights to keep you engaged ahhh what a fun movie!! I would say it does have some scary moments but I think the majority of the movie is so light hearted and fun that most kids can distinguish that it's just a movie.

Johnny Depp is awesome and extremely hilarious as Captain Jack Sparrow, who arrives at Port Royal to steal a ship, and find the Black Pearl. He sees a woman named Elizabeth Swann fall into the water, and rescues her. He is soon arrested for piracy, but gets away, only to have a sword fight with Will Turner, who is in love with Elizabeth. Years ago, Elizabeth found a piece of cursed Aztec gold on Will, and now the cursed crew of the Pearl come to take it back. When Elizabeth is kidnapped, Will needs Jack's help to save her.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1F71K91R8GUGB	Rando	I chose a four-star rating because this is a generally great movie. To me, it's the perfect blend of action, comedy, horror, and mystery. I would recommend this to any tween, because although it's rated PG-13, it's not as bad as they say it is. (Movie ratings are always exceedingly cautious.) This movie is epic, because it tells the story of the amazingly talented negotiator, Jack Sparrow, the natural beauty and leader Elizabeth Swan, and the sword fighter Will Turner. While Will sets out to rescue Elizabeth from the wily pirates on the &#34;Black Pearl&#34;, Jack Sparrow sets a goal to get back his beloved ship, so the cursed men on the ship can't keep it any longer. It's a rather interesting storyline, and I highly recommend this movie to a tween who is looking for a unique, entertaining movie. *Please note that this movie has a few sexual-related sentences and scary images that may not be appropriate for young kids.	4.0	A 12 Year Old's Review	2013-12-22	0	0	0

The effects are not that great. The way they are used is what's so special.2.  The way they treat violence and sex. How can a PG-13 movie be a family movie? When the subject matter is treated with . . . discretion. For example, we aren't treated to the blood spurting decapitation scenes, even though the primary weapon is the sword. But we know that plenty of blood is being spilled.3.  Johnny Depp continues to be an actor first, not a model. Ditto for Orlando Bloom.

It seems that some pirates stole Cortez's gold, but there's a curse. For the pirates to break the curse, they have to get all of the gold back and offer up blood with it.  I know that's a fast review, but that's the core of the movie.The characters are fantastic!! I love Jack Sparrow! When I think of the word ""pirate"" he comes to mind. Depp portrayed Sparrow in a fantastic way! He brought so much life, wit, humor, charm and personality to Sparrow. Sparrow adds to much to the movie.  All of the characters play off Sparrow so well it gives the movie depth.  The other characters, Will, Elisabeth, the commander, Barbasossa and the pirates are fantastic!This movie has so many plot twists that will keep the viewer glued to the very end, and wanting more. I know I did.The transfer to blu ray is the best transfer I've ever seen! I was honestly blow away.  The sound is fantastic! You really hear the explosions and the waves at the ships sail through the water.  The sound is amazing! I just couldn't believe what I was hearing. It honestly was that good!  The image transfer was outstanding! The images were so crisp, clear and sharp it adds a wonderful aspect to the movie. As I said, this was the BEST movie transfer to Blu Ray that I've ever seen.

Borrowing some of its verve, not to mention stealing some elements outright, from another great pirate movie The Crimson Pirate with Burt Lancaster, this is a fun, well made film.  The acting is much above normal with an largerly British cast.  Johnny Depp's Captian Jack Sparrow is off-beat, quirky, and a bit over the top, but an interesting turn for a surprisingly good actor.  Handsome Orlando Bloom plays the upright Will Turner who slowly takes to Jack and his flexible moral code with believable charm.  Geffory Rush is a fine villan as Pirate Captain Barbossa and Jonathan Pryce does a nice turn as the foppish Governor Swann of Port Royal, father of Elizabeth, the love interest and female lead.  The Special effects have equal billing, but don't overwhelm the actors as is so often the case.  The script is light, but interesting enough for adults and violence kept at typical Disney levels.  Better than most films of the genre and with lots of very funny throw away lines.  Get your popcorn and have a good oldfashioned saturday afternoon movie.	5.0	Good pirate fun	2004-02-06	3	3	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A33M8TTTYDDHLZ	Rebecca Carter	No matter what Captain Jack Sparrow says, he could sail to Tortuga on his onesies, because Johnny Depp makes the film. Heck, they should have just called it 'The Adventures Of Captain Jack Sparrow.' He really looked like a pirate to me, and his walk proved that he must have felt much more at ease on the water than on the land.  He has many quotable lines which have had people talking since the movie came out (I cant sail this ship to Tortuga on me onesies, savvy...Yo ho yo ho and really bad eggs...human hair-from my back...welcome to the Caribbean love) and he still manages to look extremely gorgeous for a dirty pirate with dreadlocked hair.  The years must have served him well, because his acting is just amazing.  I saw the film and had to see it again.  Its just one of those characters that everyone can find something to like about.Orlando Bloom was equally as good looking, and his acting seems to have improved greatly since his days at Guilhall School of Music and Drama. My best friend's mum personally knew him. Not that that matters.  He truly played the role of a love struck blacksmith to a tea, willing to die for his lady and go to any lengths to save her.Geoffrey Rush plays his part spectacularly, with a great accent (have you heard his accent in Finding Nemo? Very different) and a great portrayal of a mutinous first mate.  I wonder if it was a good part to play?  Somehow, you can't really hate his character.  He plays it so well that you can see his motives for doing what he does, and some of his lines are quite funny.Keira Knightly, worth millions and she is only 18. What a wonderful actress she is already!  Although occasionally her performance was a bit bland, most of the time she shone on screen, and i could really connect with her character.It was great to watch the swordfighting scenes, they looked totally real and all of the sets were amazingly true to life.  The scoundrel pirates were hilarious to watch, and you could really see where they were coming from...well, theyre pirates, they are allowed to create havoc...or as Jack Sparrow would say, pillage plunder and pilfer their weasley black guts out.Buy the video, the DVD, the merchandise...this film is the best Ive seen all year, with an ifectious soundtrack and some interesting characters.

I went since my daughter is a fan of Orlando Bloom & he is not hard on the eyes for me either. The movie, itself, was very entertaining. Johnny Depp was hilarious & I am not a huge fan of his, since his films are so inconsitent, in my mind. My only complaint would be the soundtrack @ times overwhelmed but in home you can always turn it down. My other complaint is that @ times there was too much going on on screen. It could have used more close-up then cut to action (like LOTR) as in fight scenes but that was minimal.

Geoffrey Rush seems to have channeled every actor to play ""Long John Silver"" but he embodies his ""Capt. Barbosa"" with a villainy that is distinctly his. Jonathan Pryce's ""Governor Swann"" is a doting and befuddled father and he pulls off the role nicely. Jack Davenport is well cast as enamored suitor and a ""loyal to the Crown"" naval officer.Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook are hilarious as bumbling Black Pearl crewmembers.Finally, one comes to further praise Johnny Depp. Only Val Kilmer is more chameleon-like. Depp brings a ""swagger"" to Jack Sparrow that is unlike any other cinematic pirate captain. The glances, the pauses, the strides all combine to make this one of the year's most memorable ""feat accomplis"".Oscar SHOULD look kindly on Depp but it's doubtful. Because of the bias against fantasy/adventure, the film (and Depp's performance) will probably be overlooked come Academy Award time.Hey, but the actor will be in great company.Richard Burton and Sir Alfred never won an Oscar, either.For that matter, never did Errol."	5.0	An Instant Adventure Classic!	2003-07-29	5	4	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ASRM8TBH9096S	Reia Whitehead	At first, I had no interest in seeing this movie. The reviews I  read weren't exactly shining. But when you're at the theatre with a bunch of people who can't decide on what to see and two of them can't even get in to a R rated movie, somtimes you just make the sacrafice. And you know what? It was worth it. I've always liked Johnny Depp, and honestly, this is one of his best performances. The movie was constantly making me laugh, usually because of Depp. Really, it's like they wrote the movie around him, then threw in some other people and a few more story twists. And there is the major (although not too major) fault of the movie. When Depp isn't on screen, you kind of stop caring about the movie and where the story is going. It's a good thing he's on screen a lot, or I might have fallen asleep. It's not that the acting is bad, it's just that none of the other characters have the charisma or the comedy like Depp's character. But hey, you can't complain. In the end, there is enough to keep you interested, and thankfully Depp's Jack Sparrow keeps delivering until the credits roll. It's worth a rental, and definetly a buy for those who like a fun, none-too-serious story.	4.0	A lot funnier than you'd think	2004-02-04	1	1	0

I'm a big fan of Johnny Depp and this movie is one of his greatest movie that he's ever done.Their makeup was extremely well done because I couldn't tell if it was really Johnny Depp or not.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2591BUPXCS705	Renee Pearison	This is a wonderful movie for anyone to watch. I was especially pleased with the absence of profanity (only 2 or 3 instances the entire movie).  Captain Jack Sparrow is a pirate who passes himself off to be incredible stupid, but who in reality is the smartest pirate you will ever see. It was very interesting to me to watch his thought process throughout the movie.  In addition, to Sparrow's antics there is the romance between Will and Elizabeth which is complicated by both Commodore Norington and Captain Barbossa.Of all the supporting characters, my personal favorite is Panchetti who gives an eye-popping performance. He is fun to watch with all of his antics and they are just the right amount to enhance the story line but not detract from it.I love the 2nd DVD that comes with this package.  It has a wide variety of items that include Jerry Bruckheimer's still shots taken from the set, historical background information, deleted scenes (3 of which I think should have made it to the film), interactive areas if you can watch the DVD on your PC, and the original Disney special of the opening of the ride.  I found it very interesting to watch the Disney special after watching the movie and seeing what all made it to the movie.I have talked to people in all stages of life that love this movie: pre-teens, teens, young adults, adults and even senior citizens. If you are looking for something to appeal to a lot of people, this is it.So, hang onto your bootstraps and be prepared for a thrill ride when you watch this movie.	5.0	Swashbuckling Fun	2004-01-15	1	1	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A30YJHZM1PRZUM	Requiem for Muse	This is a very good movie.  Let's get one thing straight, if you see this movie and do not like Johnny Depp's character, you most likely will really hate this movie.  I give it 5 stars because I personally like all elements of this movie.  It does have somewhat weak acting, and a pretty solid plot.  But Captain Jack Sparrow is enough for me to give it 5 stars alone.  If you don't like pirates don't see this movie.  If you don't like half drunk people, don't see this movie.  If you're looking for the best movie with the best plot, don't see this movie, because you will be disappointed and stupidly write a bad review about a great movie.  It's a movie for good times, not to be taken seriously.  Disney has produced another good title.  It's not aimed to please only adults, so if you're looking to rip on the childish elements of the movie, you'll find them.  So don't see it and shut up.And to whoever is mad about this only being in wide screen edition, screw you.  You don't have to have a damn wide screen t.v. to enjoy widescreen movies.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2VMLRWA004CZC	reviewer	"This movie is full of great scenes, great laughs, and very great acting.  I agree with everyone who says Johnny deserves an Oscar, he has set the bar so high that most actors can't even see it.  I am not sure that the Academy can be shaken loose from its stagnant state, but if anyone can do it, it is a character by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow.Geoffrey Rush's performance was also remarkable just for the fact that you also notice it, even when Johnny is stealing scenes.  Somehow he managed to be evil and cartoonish at the same time, and there was something very ""Disney"" about his character.PoTC supposedly has a scene that pays homage to the movie ""Groundhog Day"", but after many viewings, I have not figured that one out yet.  But I've enjoyed trying - it has given me more opportunties to see a greatly entertaining movie.Congratulations Disney, PoTC is already a modern classic.Confidential to the reviewer from Michigan: don't forget to check out ""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape"" to see more fantastic Depp work (with a bonus way-beyond-oscar-calibre performance by Leonardo DiCaprio)."	5.0	The bar has moved way up	2003-10-07	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AZVTZVW7RJX48	"RHC ""TemporaryOne-1"""	Johnny Depp is stunningly outlandish as the swaggering, happy-go-lucky Captain Jack Sparrow. From the ornamental decorations of his dread-locked hair, right down to his dancing footsteps, Depp offers his fans a tremendous performance in this children's film of majestic proportions. The screen is filled with splashes of colors: the deep serpentine blues of the ocean, the lead grays & ebony blacks of the pirate costumes, and the noble red & gold cloaks of the Governors' soldiers. The pirates are delectably crass, and all the characters are imbued with a jocular wit that will keep the audience laughing throughout.Children and adults alike will be enthralled by the swash-buckling sword scene between Sparrow & Will (played by the dashing Orlando Bloom), with the swords clicking to the rhythm of Klaus Badelt's magnetic, glitteringly pulsating soundtrack.Alongside the incontestably illuminous Johnny Depp, who is magnificent in his interpretation of a whimsical, woe-be-gone pirate, are Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swan (who's delicate doe-like features belie her tough tenacity), Orlando Bloom as Wil Turner (who's refined, princely features complement Depp's sultry, dark, handsome, gypsy features), Jack Davenport as Elzabeth's noble fiance, and Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's father, the weak-kneed governor.Rounding out the cast is Geoffrey Rush as the mutinous pirate Barbossa. Rush is fervent, booming, extravagantly malicious, and even humanly poignant in his portrayal of a misguided man, (made immortal) who pines redemption.The special effects are dazzling, the music is sparklingly refreshing, and the acting - especially that of Johnny Depp -are memorable.This film is a must-see for anyone who wants to watch a wholesome movie filled with action & romance.	5.0	Colourful!

The other commentaries are much more interesting and entertaining. Gore and Johnny mostly comment on whom they know in the film rather than how they did it. &quot;Hey look! It's so-and-so!&quot; &amp; &quot;so-and-so is a beautiful beautiful person.&quot; was typical throughout. Boring!&lt;Commentary by producer Jerry Bruckheimer and Stars Keira Knightley And Jack Davenport&gt;This was in fact the most entertaining of the commentaries! I don't really even like Keira Knightley very much but she was so funny in the commentary. I don't remember hearing Jerry Bruckheimer AT ALL in this commentary. As I recall it was only Jack Davenport and Keira. Jack is a very funny man and loved making fun of his character throughout. You can tell that he and Keira get along very well and had a good time with the film.&lt;Commentary by writers Stuart Beattie, Ted Elliot &amp; Terry Rossio and Jay Wolpert&gt;This commentary track was very interesting. I thought it would be more boring than the ones with the cast but it wasn't. They talked about the writing process and what was in the various drafts of the film. They also point out many of the more subtle nods to the ride.&lt;An Epic At Sea: The Making of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl&quot;&gt;Typical &quot;making of&quot; featurette with all you expect from them.&lt;19 Deleted and Alternate Scenes&gt;Most of these were really &quot;alternate&quot; scenes and not completely new. There were more nods to the ride that I really wish made the final cut of the film. An interesting change they made was to the scene when Jack meets with Mr. Gibbs in the bar. Orlando's character was standing by a pole waiting for them to talk in private and an ugly fat woman comes up to him and he finds her repulsive. Well, in the alternate version it was an attractive woman instead. And there were more cuts to Orlando and his reactions.&lt;&quot;Moonlight&quot; Scene Progression&gt;Showed a bit on how much work went into the special effects. They had to film each scene (that contained skeletal pirates) three times: once with all actors, once with only the uncursed (humans) and once with motion-control for the pirate actors so they could copy their moves into the computer for the skeletal reproductions.When Keira did her scene where the skeletons throw her around it was only her alone with nobody else on set. The skeletons were all added later (obviously).&lt;&quot;Below Deck&quot; - An Interactive History Of Pirates&gt;LOADS of information and facts about real pirates. It's basically an interview with a knowledgable professor-historian-expert dude, but it's chopped into pieces and categorized so you can only watch the parts that interest you instead of watching a lengthy interview. The downside is they removed the possibility to rewind or fast-forward so if you miss something, you have to start the clip over.&lt;&quot;Fly on the Set&quot; Featurette&gt;Interesting footage of some of the action sequences uncut and before the cgi.&lt;&quot;Diary of a Pirate&quot; - Behind-the-Scenes look with cast member Lee Arenberg&gt;This is DV footage by the very funny actor who played Pintel (the shorter, stockier pirate who was sidekick to the tall, lanky one with the wooden eye).&lt;&quot;Diary of a Ship&quot; Video Journal&gt;A journey that the ship (used as the Commodore) took getting to the island where they needed it for filming. The crew on the ship went through quite a lot in getting the ship there - storms, passing through the panama canal, dolphins and more.&lt;&quot;Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color&quot; - Archival TV Program&gt;This is an AWESOME look back in time to when the Pirates of the Caribbean ride was first &quot;unveiled&quot; at Disneyland. Hosted by Walt Disney himself (from the early 60's), it shows us the entire process in planning, designing and building the ride. It also takes us on a tour through most of the ride so we can see direct comparisons of some of the scenes from the film. It's been a few years since I was last at Disneyland so I had forgotten some of the features of this ride. Watching this I found at least 4 or 5 more &quot;nods&quot; from the movie.&lt;Producer's Diary Featurette With Jerry Bruckheimer&gt;I didn't know Jerry was such a good photographer. I thought this would be boring, but it's really great! It's basically a slideshow of several pictures Jerry took while filming. He does a great commentary throughout the &quot;slideshow&quot;.&lt;Blooper Reel&gt;This was HILLAREUS! Nearly all the outtakes included Johnny Depp. He is a very funny man! My favorite was the part when the pirates catch him in the cave and he tries to remember the word &quot;Parlay&quot;. Except in the outtake, he and Lee Arenberg (Pintel) adlibbed a long section where Johnny went into a Indian accent (something about curry) and then on to French foods (something about Mayonnaise). A total riot!I don't have a DVD-Rom so I can't speak for those features.Hope this helps a bit! :)Johnny Depp really makes this movie!

This sudden, terrifying revelation could've made a much bigger impact on the audience (and they shouldn't have wasted this scene in previews either). As it is, we first learn of the curse when Captain Jack is in jail and one of the Black Pearl pirates grabs his neck in the moonlight, his arm turning skeletal. But, as we learn later, Jack should've turned skeletal in that scene as well.A minor complaint, as the film is still a huge load of fun.(WHAAA! WHAAA!

The action was incredible, the acting superb, and the effects were phenomenal. Johnny Depp turned in an Oscar-caliber performance and created a memorable, quirky, and lovable Jack Sparrow. The story was gripping and a lot of fun to watch, though there were a couple plot holes that one needs to overlook. The effects, however, make up for any other lapses in the movie. When the sailors turn into the undead, the transformation is unbelievable. The integration of the actors and the computer-generated creatures is seamless. And if you like to see how it's all done, the DVD shows how they pulled it together.

Add pirates, amazing special effects, ships, skeletons and a bottle of rum, well-- you've got yerslef a winner!While the rest of the cast is exceptional, this is Johnny Depp's movie.  He steals every scene as the scheming, dirty, witty pirate Cap'n Jack Sparrow.  He adds hilarious facial charecteristics and just a bit of well, himself, into his charecter.  It's amazing what the guy can do.  He is just SO funny!  Just watching him walk makes me burst out laughing.  I love this guy!The basic summary is: Elizabeth Swann is the governer's daughter.  She gets kidnapped by pirates, and the man secretly in love with her, Will Turner, invests in the aid of Jack Sparrow, a pirate, to save her.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AMKZHBOK7VMQR	R. J. Marsella	Adventure, romance, comedy and a bit of horror thrown in, yet this film brings all of those elements together in a highly entertaining package. Johnny Depp is outrageous as Capt. Jack Sparrow an audacious and skilled pirate who has the most bizarre mannerisms. His performance pretty much steals the show although the rest of the cast are all very strong. The scenery and the costumes are wonderful and some of the scenes replicate the Disneyland ride in a very amusing way.The biggest risk the film takes is with respect to plot.Trying to create a story from the premise of a 10 minute ride was probably quite a challenge. However the writers pull it off and the story keeps us interested until the very end.This is a great family entertainment that offers something for everyone. One of the best Disney films overall.	5.0	This movie's got it all.	2004-05-22	3	2	1

Surprising part was the underlying humor and how the scenes from the Disney ride popped up. I almost shouted to my wife several times---&quot;hey remember that scene, its in the ride!!&quot;Excellent performances, decent plot, but the spectacular special effects really, really, are the icing on a tasty cake. the scenes as the skeletons move from moonlight to people in the dark are very well done.I look forward to the 2nd disk of extras for tomorrow night's diversion, if they have anything on how the SFX were accomplished or pieces of them actually doing it, i would watch as carefully as i did the movie.I'm surprised it went to dvd so fast, i hadn't even had the chance to see it in our local cheapseats movie.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1LE79HKL5G9C6	Rob6965	I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best action-adventure movies of all time. Director Gore Verbinski has found a winning formula with this combination of great acting, stellar special effects, and outstanding original music to tie up the package.The story begins when Captain Jack Sparrow, played fabulously by Johnny Depp, sails into Port Royal, Jamaica, a British stronghold in the Caribbean. Soon, however, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) sails into port with his notorious crew of pirates on board the Black Pearl. The crew attacks the town and kidnaps Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), who has a medallion of very special value to the Black Pearl's crew. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), decides to set off after the Pearl with the help of Sparrow. Soon however, the characters discover that Barbossa and his crew aren't what they appear...All plot summary aside, the real question is: why should you see this movie?First off, the film is worth seeing if only for Depp's performance as Sparrow. Instead of the common idea of pirates as sinister, Sparrow is a slightly insane, yet hilarious pirate who always comes through with classic one-liners. Depp's portrayal of Sparrow is what makes the film an action-comedy, and lightens up the normally dark nature of pirates. From his wardrobe to his off-kilter movements, Sparrow is an unforgettable character who has to be seen.Also, the action sequences are outstanding. From frantic sword fights to tense naval battles, the special effects and interesting twists on classic formulas make the action sequences awesome. The special effects in Pirates are very well done and believable. They are most notable in portraying what happens to the crew of The Black Pearl in the moonlight (without giving too much away). The well-written plot realizes that an action movie  hinges upon its action sequences, and moves hastily through locations to keep the viewer from getting bored.So, I highly recommend seeing this movie. It puts a piraty twist on the classic adventure movie formula and is very watchable. Between great acting and great action sequences, what else could you want from an action movie?	5.0	Welcome Aboard the Black Pearl	2007-01-25	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3QGUMI8OB4CCJ	Robert A. Keeler	We rented this flick with high hopes - Depp being one of our favorite actors. And he delivered! Always amusing, clever, couldn't take our eyes off him. HOWEVER. The movie itself was frequently incomprehensible. It was hard for us to figure out just who was doing what and to whom, and why. For comprehensive plot description, we had to read these other reviews! Not the best way to enjoy a movie.	3.0	Depp To The Rescue	2005-03-05	8	4	4
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A38XHXKPDKHP8N	Robert Anderson	Great movie and Great extra features in the 2-DVD set!  If you're considering buying this DVD you've probably already seen the movie so I won't rant on about how great it is other than saying it's an awesome swashbuckling adventure and Johnnie Depp puts a wonderful spin on the pirate role.  Also, the extra features (2 DVD set) are great and go well beyond the usual paltry stuff that you get on most DVDs.However, be ye warned that this DVD ONLY PLAYS IN WIDESCREEN ratio - there is no option to format it for a TV with normal dimensions (Why?! - Your guess is as good as mine, - but that's why I only gave this 4 stars instead of five).  So, if you are one of the 98% of us who don't have a widescreen TV, you're going to watch it with those annoying blank areas above and below the picture.  This little fact isn't mentioned on the packaging - except for a little ambiguous snippet in small print under the specifications section on the back.So, if you'd rather have all of the extra features (which are good) get the DVD set.  But if it's more important to you to see the movie take up your entire TV screen then I suggest you get the video (I'm going to return mine and get the video instead).	4.0	Argh!

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	"Disney didn't do so bad by creating a movie out of an already established theme park attraction(theirs of course)and came up with a successful trilogy that has so far put around $3 billion into that empires coffers;an amazing feat by any measure.It also re-invented the pirate genre and whether you're a fan of it or not,this movie appealed to people across the board with its' universal themes of good against evil and love lost and found.It also couldn't have been accomplished in quite the fashion it had if not for a certain Mr.Depp.Totally ""a-depp-t"" at playing off beat characters Depp imbued his character with a certain je ne sais quoi;an off beat combination of drunkenness,delirium and effeminacy.One has to see the performance to appreciate it but it is,in my opinion,why ""Pirates"" did the business it did in the first place and garnered the wide appeal it otherwise wouldn't have had.Pirates of the Caribbean-The curse of the Black Pearl""(released July/03)involves the story of one pirate by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow(Depp).Jack arrives via a sinking boat.It is a Buster Keaton gag in reverse(you will recall Depps Keaton-like portrayal in ""Benny and Joon"" and his self professed interest in same).Instead of in Keatons ""The Boat"" with the vessel launching and sinking totally into the water,here we have Sparrow arriving into Port Royal as the boat sinks and he steps daintily onto the jetty without getting his feet wet.Sparrow has arrived to commandeer one of His Majesty's ships to find and regain control of the Black Pearl taken away from him by another pirate Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush).At this time a local naval Capt.Norrington(Jack Davenport)is being promoted to Commodore and just after the ceremony he is standing with the governor's daughter Elizabeth(Keira Knightley)on the forts parapet and proposing to her .With a too tight corset binding her waist she suddenly faints and falls into the water.Capt.Sparrow sees the fall and jumps in and saves her life.When they are reunited with dry land Sparrow gets arrested for the pirate he is,but before they can put him in irons he leads them all on a merry chase.One hiding place leads him into a blacksmith shop co-run by one Will Turner(Orlando Bloom).Sword play ensues until Jack is cornered and is finally taken prisoner.While in jail his ship The Black Pearl arrives into the harbour and sets about with some severe mayhem and destruction.They were drawn there by a medallion of Mayan gold which hangs around the neck of Elizabeth who is taken prisoner by Capt.Barbossa,who knows she holds an important key to undoing the curse which is upon him and his crew.The crew and he are cursed as half alive and half dead men because they stole the Mayan gold and spent it.They have spent years collecting it all and Elizabeth holds one of the last important pieces.The ship nows heads to the Island of the Dead to return all the stolen pieces of gold;with Sparrow and blacksmith Will Turner(Elizabeth's true love) in pursuit.Barbossa believing Elizabeth's lie that she is the daughter of a former Black Pearl crewman by the name of Bootstrap Bill Turner,returns her gold coin and offers up some of her blood to dispel the curse.Of course this doesn't work and Sparrow is on hand to battle Barbossa.However Will knocks Jack out and steals off with Elizabeth.When Jack comes to he barters with Barbossa and agrees to lead him to the real descendant of Bootstrap Bill.Barbossa charges after Turner and the ship is sunk and so are Jacks bargaining chip.He and Elizabeth are stranded on a desert island together.Elizabeth lights a giant bonfire which attracts the attentions of a passing British ship commanded by Commodore Norrington.They proceed to the Island of the Dead in order to capture the pirates.They plan an ambush but in the meantime Jack persuades Barbossa to capture the British ship sitting out in the harbour.Barbossa's  crew indeed infiltrates the ship and in the meantime Elizabeth frees the Black Pearl crew who instead of helping sail off.Elizabeth returns to the island and frees Will.Will and Jack(who also has a piece of gold) throw them into the chest and the curse is finally lifted.As it does Jack fires a shot into Barbossa thus killing him and his crew fighting to overtake the British ship surrenders now that they are mortal.Back at Port Royal Jack and Will are scheduled to be executed but Elizabeth stands up for them both.Will is pardoned while Jack escapes by jumping into the bay and is rescued by the Black Pearl crew.When asked for directions Jack consults his wonky compass and they sail away to new adventures.However the film ends at the Island of the Dead as a monkey of Barbossa's grabs one of the gold pieces from the chest and the curse is re-instated.This film is a typical Bruckheimer venture with lots and lots of non stop action and SFX mixed together with a good sense of humour throughout.The picture contains a wonderful cast from Knightly and Bloom as the love interests,Jonathan Pryce as the doting but sometimes misguided father/Governor of Jamaica,Rush does a great stereo-typical pirate,several actors do funny turns as crew members both for the pirates and the British,etc.But the numero uno and top dog throughout the entire proceedings is Johnny Depp.He devours the scenery every time he is on screen and completely dominates the picture.His turn as Capt.Jack Sparrow is a marvelous piece of acting as he creates before our eyes a very eccentric character that you can't help but empathize with.It is no wonder this film was the hit it was with such talent on hand.Technically this two disc set has been transferred wonderfully in both the sight and sound departments.It is presented in its widescreen format and is viewable with DTS 5.1 or Dolby 5.1 sound.Extras include:deleted and alternate scenes,blooper reels,audio commentaries,featurettes:the making of,history of pirates,""diary of a pirate"" and""diary of a ship"",producers photo gallery,image galleries,scene progression for the underwater ""dead' sequence and many extras for viewing on a computer.All in all a highly recommended film/DVD set that will appeal across a wide spectrum of age groups.It is full of high seas action,adventure and fun courtesy of a highly talented pack of actors;especially one talented Mr.Johnny Depp."	4.0	4 1/2 stars for the film that re-invented the pirate genre on film!	2010-06-06	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1YSI93GVIVPPT	Robert Fernandez	I've been awaiting this film since I first heard it was being produced last summer. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland was one of my favorites, so the wait for the movie seemed much longer for me. Gore Verbinski did a great job at directing this film; it didn't follow the Disney formula of blatantly moralizing the movie for the parents and the kids. Then again, this IS Disney's first movie to get a PG-13 rating, so maybe they're lightening up a bit. Anyways, the movie is about a gang of cursed pirates who cannot enjoy life in general because of the curse they're under, and the only way to reverse the curse is by taking the blood of the certain person they're looking for. Orlando Bloom was good as the blacksmith, Will Turner, and his swordfighting skills didn't look fake at all. Johnny Depp was very comical and eccentric at times, but is crucial to the storyline, and not JUST there for comedy relief. Geoffrey Rush did a vicously good job as the menacing Captain Barbossa, who, like his crew, becomes a frightening skeletal figure in the moonlight.The film borrows MANY scenes from the ride: The attack on the port town, the skeletons, the cave of the cursed treasure, the town that's overrun by drunken pirates, and of course, the song 'Yo Ho Yo Ho A Pirates' Life For Me!', which is sung over 4 times throughout the film. The storyline has a few twists and startling revelations, and its filled with lots of action. The number of deaths in the film is staggering, and the skeletal pirates are very frightening and relentless; they gave no mercy to their enemies when they killed them. There's also a few scenes where you see people's hands get sliced, so those who are squeemish should beware. The special effects by ILM were spectacular; some of their best work yet. And the music was okay, but don't expect nothing memorable like Star Wars or Back to the Future or Jurassic Park's theme music.And finally,stay after the end credits. If you wait for all the ending credits to roll by, you'll get treated to a creepy little scene that possibly hints at a sequel. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is easily one of this summer's best movies. Now I can barely wait for Disney's next ride-to-movie conversion: The Haunted Mansion.	5.0	One of the best movies of the summer.	2003-07-12	5	4	1

Crawford	This is OK as time-wasting fodder:  you get fights, very good character development, and mysterious ghosts.  However, it just plods on in the most silly and predictable of plots, really a Hollywood formula thang.  I have seen this a few times, now with my kids, and while I enjoy the beginning, once I get thru about 5 battles I really don't want to see any more.  So much slashing it gets kind of boring and does little to advance the plot.  What saves this is the acting.  Nonetheless, I find it hard to believe that this is Disney's highest grossing flick of all time.  You really don't need to see this more than once - it doesn't meet the test of multiple viewings.	3.0	with such good actors, it is a pity the plot is so lame	2007-03-27	7	2	5

It seems that the just wanted to be able to say they have 10 hours worth of extras and they just picked up all the crap on the editing room floor and called it an extras.I won't nock off a star for it since I am really just rating the movie.	5.0	Very good movie	2004-04-24	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	Having thoroughly enjoyed the ride at Disneyland on numerous occasions, I expected to have a great time seeing this movie and was not disappointed...except by its length which is about 15-20 minutes too long. Otherwise, great entertainment. Faithful to the pirate tradition, Depp almost immediately steals this film and clutches it to his heart until the final scene. Credit Rush with a formidable challenge to Depp's idiosyncratic performance. Having already stolen Jack Sparrow's ship (what else? The Black Pearl), his Captain Barbossa almost steals center stage as well. Almost. Director Gore Verbinski generally keeps the plot moving along. The special effects are outstanding. All members of the cast seem to be in perfect alignment with the whimsical tone. Credit Jonathan Pryce (Governor Swann) with keeping a straight face throughout all the nonsense. As with the Monty Python and Naked Gun films, it is imperative for everyone involved to sustain, indeed nourish a sense of gravitas. Of course the plot is highly contrived and relentlessly implausible. Of course there is a happy ending. Relax, suspend all presumption of rationality, and enjoy. We need much more such carefully crafted nonsense and should be grateful whenever we encounter it.	5.0	Pure Entertainment	2003-11-25	40	31	9

OH MY GOD, HURT ME!!!!!

Anyway, the whole movie is fantastic, the sets are amazing, the action will keep you awake for the whole 2 hours & 14 minutes, the musical score is unparalleled, and, AGAIN, the Jack Sparrow character is so fun, wonderful & different from anything I've seen before that even if I hadn't already loved pirates, I'd have wanted to become one after seeing this!

I was dragged kicking and screaming to the video store and only grudgingly rented it at the insistence of my daughter. I thought it was going to be juvenile and silly. Yes, it was juvenile and silly, but I really enjoyed this film. Johnny Depp reminds us again why he is such a good actor. Cast as pirate captain Jack Sparrow Depp delivers a superb performance.The opening scene was hilarious, portending what the rest of the movie was going to be like. This was one funny movie. The humor was unexpected, it just did not go where you thought it would. The continued reference to the pirates code being just one example of the off-beat humor.Of course, the special effects were stunning. The evil pirate crew, cursed by Cortezs treasure are the evil undead. Without giving anything away, I sat in utter amazement how they were able to so seamlessly weave together these effects.Not a film for the wee ones. The violence and the evil undead would give them nightmares for a month. But for the rest of us, it is an enjoyable evenings entertainment.	4.0	This is one funny film	2004-01-03	1	1	0

Depp and Rush, in particular, are so over-the-top you just can't help but smile at their virtuoso performances. And director Gore Verbinski just lets them have their fun.The feel of the movie is somewhere in the realm between ""The Princess Bride"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"", with plenty of comedy, action, magic, and creepy evil skeleton pirates. Just the right pacing, plus an incredible score, keeps the movie going. My only concern is that the children viewing this might be confused by the nature of the actual ""curse"", as it is not spelled out very clearly. Still, the kids will have plenty of fun with the thrills and action. Just watching Johnny Depp stumble around and gesticulating like someone in the throes of a mild acid trip is hilarious enough.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"**1/2God bless Johnny Depp, for without him ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" would be just another empty big budget studio extravaganza - juvenile, bloated and over-reliant on stunt work and special effects.  But thanks to Depp's brave and witty performance, the film rises above its own inherent weaknesses to become at least a halfway entertaining picture.  He is the real treasure here.""Inspired"" - if one dares use so lofty a term - by the Disney theme park attraction of the same name, ""Pirates"" takes us to the never-never land of swashbuckling heroes and shiver-me-timbers foolishness.  Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who was left for dead on an island by his mutinous crew.  Sparrow, captain of the legendary Black Pearl, a ship with the reputation for possessing evil, unearthly powers, has now returned from his exile and is ready to exact revenge on the mates who abandoned him.  There's really no point in thrashing out the complicated but essentially simpleminded plot here.  Suffice it to say that it involves a diabolical curse, a literal ghost ship with a literal skeleton crew, a feisty damsel-in-distress and enough repetitive swordplay and ""avast me, hardy"" dialogue to keep the action adventure crowd purring with contentment.For all the care that has gone into the look of the film - the costumes, set design and computer-generated special effects - ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" would sink pretty quickly were it not for Depp giving his all to keep it afloat.  His lisping, flamboyant, over-the-top approach to the character is exactly what this stale little tale needs to lift it above the ordinary.  One has only to see Depp mincing around - where anyone else in the part would have been swaggering - to verify what we have known all along about Depp as an actor, which is that he is willing to take risks and explore different avenues when tackling a role, even one as lightweight and insubstantial as this one.  He turns what could have been a mere walk-through, check-cashing part into an inspired comic turn.  One can only imagine what a boring movie this would have been without him.  For, indeed, the story itself is silly and the other characters (except for Geoffrey Rush`s evil Captain Barbossa) stiff, dull and uninteresting.  But Depp is the real deal, and all I can say is that I hope he received a large percentage of the film`s phenomenal box office booty.  Like any good pirate, he deserves it."	2.0	Depp is the only real treasure here	2005-02-22	27	23	4
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2Z6MYSG1W0MEV	"Roller blade ""Amy"""	"""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is the kind of movie that most people enjoy for different reasons, but that never really amounts to anything substantial. The script was altogether bad, so commenting on the individual performances of the actors seems to be the most logical thing to do. Needless to say, my focus was almost entirely on Johnny Depp the first time I saw this movie. He gives a good performance, and makes you want to watch him throughout the whole movie, and never pay attention to anyone else. However, seeing the movie a second time, I realized that Rush's performance was as good, if not better than Depp's. Orlando Bloom did an average job playing an average, slightly stupid character. Kiera Knightly was possibly the worst actor in this movie; she seemed fake and inconsistent throughout most of her performance. The only character worse than Elizabeth (who's lines, by the way, were most obnoxious and unrealistic) was the random female pirate, whom we meet when we hear a high-pitched squeal of ""You stole my ship!!"". Pirate movies are not made to impress obsessive feminists, okay? This actor, whoever she was, obviously didn't put an ounce of effort into developing her character. Commodor Noringtton wasn't too bad, except his change in the end seemed completely random, and not character-driven at all. Also, the music was terrible, especially for the half-dead pirates (good special effects), but maybe it was supposed to be bad?All in all, however, this was a fun movie to watch. I could go on complaining about it forever, and thinking of ways it could have been better, but, as much as I sometimes hate to admit it, I really enjoy watching this movie. Pirate movies are fun, and this one really wasn't meant to be any more than entertaining."	3.0	ANOTHER BAD PIRATE MOVIE	2005-10-13	10	1	9

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"The plucky daughter of a British governor and a local blacksmith take on the blackest of black-hearted pirates in this Disney action flick that's inspired by (and riffs on) the famous Disney ride.  William Turner (Orlando Bloom) is just a boy when he's fished out of the sea, his ship blown to pieces after an attack by the cruel crew of the accursed ""Black Pearl"".  Thought an innocent victim when first spotted that day by young Elizabeth Swann (eventually played by Keira Knightley), Turner wears a curious pendant - a skull-marked dubloon.  Elizabeth hides the dubloon, sure that the officious Captain Norrington will hang the boy as a pirate if the coin is found on his neck.  Years later, Elizabeth is beautiful young woman still obsessed with piracy, while Turner has become a blacksmith on the tropical royal colony they both call home.  As a lowly blacksmith, Turner can only pine silently for Elizabeth and work his frustrations out by practicing swordplay (3 hours daily).  Then the pirates, led by the thoroughly evil Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) appear.  They sack Port Royale, fixated on Turner's dubloon, and carry away both it and Elizabeth.  As the Royal Navy prepares a rescue mission, Elizabeth learns the dark secret of the Black Pearl's crew - how it was cursed by its plunder of Aztec gold to an existence of life-in-death (gorily rendered in CGI).At this point, this sounds like another lame-brained idea for a Disney movie, or a misfire attempt to reinvigorate the swashbuckler movie thought lost at sea after two film adaptations of ""Pirates of Penzance"" in the early 1980's, a Roman Polanski flick from 1986, and ""Cutthroat Island"" all flopped.  Instead, the script tosses in Jack Sparrow - a sun-fried pirate driven slightly loopy after being marooned on a remote island years earlier by Barbossa.  Played by Johnny Depp (wearing more eye-shadow than Boy George), Sparrow is a wonder - part hero, part comic relief.  We never know what he's going to do next (neither does he), nor whether he will prove to be the worst pirate you've ever seen or the greatest pirate you ever will know.  Depp gives Sparrow some great mannerisms and a vicious accent (like Mr. Scott from Star Trek after one-too many Saurian Brandies) to go with his fun lines.  The joke is that his tropical-madness makes him the clearest-minded character in the whole movie.  Also great is Rush who makes Barbossa both formidable and laughable at the same time.BUT IS IT FOR KIDS?  My 6 year-older was dying to see it, though it's borderline appropriate.  There's a heavy atmosphere of violence (reaching heights during several action sequences spaced throughout the movie).  The CGI that turns the crew of the Pearl into spectral wraiths is scary - though a fast and deft scene in which Elizabeth first sees them in their moonlit glory is actually quite funny (and reminds you of the movie's roots as a ride).  The overt violence (slashing and strangling) actually happens off the edge of the screen (just like in ""Holes"") though kids will know what's going on.  (The producers were probably afraid that they were verging into territory of the ""A-Team"" and figured that they needed to make a point that vicious pirates actually hurt people.)  That aside, this was a rollicking good film, and a reminder for his fans that there's less and less that Depp can't do."	4.0	Dead man tell great takes	2004-02-02	2	2	0

Pirates is actually a really good time and one that you might not shelling out for again and again, damn him!On a Summer Movie Scale of 1 to 10, Pirates of the Caribbean pirates a 9. Three factors have led me to make this declaration. First, yagotta have excitement and Pirates delivers with swashbuckling verve. Second, the visuals and dialogue contain references that might even make your 85-year-old grandmother chuckle. Third: the presence of Johnny Depp, possibly the most talented, expressive movie actor working today. How can you not love the man who based his character on Keith Richards? (There is an obvious fourth reason that you'd probably mention first if you were a 10 to 80-year-old girl. His name is Orlando Bloom and he's our token hot sun-kissed boy).Depp is pirate Jack Sparrow, formerly captain of the ill-famed monster ship the Black Pearl. After being ousted from power by a gang of mutant mutineers led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Sparrow escapes from his island exile to Port Royal in the hopes of ""commandeeringa new vessel. Not much later, the aforementioned mutineers attack Port Royal. Their objective is to find the last piece to a puzzle that would liberate them from a vile curse (a curse which makes them flesh by day and rotted corpses by moonlight). Who possesses this puzzle piece? None other than gorgeous Port Royal citizen Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) and the hot patootie she stole it from, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Long story much shorter: she is kidnapped, he enlists Sparrow's help to rescue her and the rest is Yo ho yo ho, a pirate's fight for three.This pirate flick is fun for everyone. Even film academicians and intellectuals will have a good time despite themselves.

First, you have people who are expecting deep, meaningful dialogue and acting. Let me say to them: It's a movie about Pirates, for Christ's sake. And, made by Disney, nonetheless. I wouldn't expect Casablanca from them, nor would I expect it from a movie about Pirates. Second, I have seen people comment on the ""historical"" facts of Pirates. It's fiction, don't take it seriously. Never does it even imply that the events were real, nor based on real events. And third are people who like to dissect the Pirates themselves, since they were, at least historically, raping, plundering, and pillaging scumbags. But, look, again I say: It came from Disney. If you were looking for non-stop bloodshed and rape, I don't know where you get the idea of Disney putting that out. The movie is oriented towards families, not history scholars or film buffs. If you didn't like it, too bad. However, I did enjoy it."	5.0	I laugh at reviews....	2006-07-15	15	11	4

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A26WVK274IA7DN	Sarah Bellum	"I cannot help but think that this film could have been much better in more capable hands. As others have noted, it runs way too long. Roger Ebert rather astutely observed that somewhere in this 143 minute movie could be a decent 90 minute movie; perhaps he is correct, though we might never know. Gore Verbinski should re-edit this movie for a director's cut and leave out about forty-five minutes; perhaps that would help resolve at least some of its shortcomings. The acting is nothing special, which is to be expected given the way the film plays like a combination of a slapstick comedy and a children's movie. Johnny Depp is a very good, serious actor, as evidenced in ""Blow,"" ""Ed Wood,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" ""Finding Neverland,"" etc., though I didn't really like his performance in this film. He does much as much can be expected to develop his character, though I cannot help but wonder if he (along with the rest of the cast) considered this from the onset as simply a paycheck because it appears many of the actors didn't take it seriously and merely phoned in their performances. It doesn't help that they didn't have much with which to work, either. I'm not certain why the principle leads would sign on for two more entries to this series, though money would again be the prime suspect. Action-adventure movies can be fun and entertaining without being shallow and resorting to clich&eacute;d tactics as this movie does; the recent Harry Potter and Spider-man movies are good examples of movies that successfully combine entertainment and action with competent, intelligent scripting. Furthermore, it seems to me the makers of this movie could not decide what the target audience for this movie would be, and the result is that it appears to be intended for children, yet is entirely too long to retain their attention and contains entirely too much violence and too many gruesome effects for children. This seems to be a problematic trademark for Verbinski, whose ""Mousehunt"" (1997) seemed to be clearly intended for children, yet contained some decidedly adult humor. I cannot really recommend a movie that has me wishing it would end halfway through it, which this one did. That is not to say it is bad or that it is dull because it is undoubtedly ambitious and there are moments throughout the film, until the last frames, which show undeniable sparks of energy. Some of the scenes work well and the action is more than adequate. Also, we don't see very many pirate movies any more, so it does have that going for it, you know, which is nice. Ultimately, however, the film meanders about, loses focus and is simply not good enough to warrant a viewing. With two more movies on the way, perhaps there was enough material among this trilogy that would have warranted making 1.5 or even 2 movies from the first the one. I received the DVD as a present, watched it once and must say I am not in a hurry to sit through it again. (However, I might skip to the scenes with Keira Knightley, whose radiance is enough to lift any film)"	3.0	Not bad, but not really all that great	2006-09-06	18	3	15

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1Y3V5OZDLK76J	sarahzuidema	This was a great movie. It had action, drama, suspense, and some scary aspects. I think when a movie can keep the attention of the viewer for the entire length of the movie it is definitly a great flick. Even the kids in the theater didn't make a disruptive sound the whole time this means a lot because i went to a sold out show where there were tons of little kids. Overall I think this is one of Johnny Depps best rolls. Definitly worth the money to go see it.	5.0	Pirates of the carribean: the curse of the black pearl	2003-07-15	2	1	1

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A302HEZ30DAKOU	Saska Albright	PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is that rare gem in a genre film - a new concept that pays homage to the classics in the genre without depending on them for success.  Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have written often for this genre (including TREASURE PLANET and THE MASK OF ZORRO), and prove here that writing really can elevate a genre piece to greatness.  The story is tight, the dialogue devoid of exposition (so you'd best be paying attention - bathroom breaks will ruin the movie for you!) unless it's in character for the character to make a speech, and the plot twists and turns so often it's actually better on repeat viewings.  This is one of the strangest and most intriguing qualities of the film: just like the theme park ride on which it is loosely based, it makes you want to get back in line and go around again.Much has been said of Johnny Depp's brilliant creation, Captain Jack Sparrow.  He takes lines that could have easily been delivered with Errol Flynn-like panache and instead crafts a performance in which we, like his counterparts in the film, are constantly wondering if he's mad or genius.  No doubt, he carries the movie.More often overlooked is the equally brilliant performance of Geoffrey Rush as the evil Captain Barbossa.  He alone is equal to Depp when they share the screen, and when they don't, no one else holds a candle to him.  He obviously relishes the role of the villain, and holds back nothing to deliver a chilling, amusing and captivating performance.  Look for him in the Supporting Actor nominations this year.With an enormous cast of well-developed supporting characters, all of whom contribute necessary developments to the plot, this has the feel of an old Hollywood film where the ensemble mattered as much as the marquee stars.  What elevates it is the seamless application of CGI to create effects that never seem gratuitous and are a true joy to watch.  Bruckheimer's pairing with Gore Verbinski gives us the Bruckheimer action film punch with Verbinski's purist directing sensibilities, and has raised my opinion of Bruckheimer's potential considerably.Despite its PG-13 rating, I found it appropriate for nearly all ages, since the horror aspect of the cursed pirates is always mitigated by humor and a sense that all will be right in the end.I never expected to find a good movie hidden inside the summer blockbuster season, but here it is - and this notoriously harsh film critic encourages you all to sit back, enjoy the ride, and brave the line a second time.	5.0	Completely unique despite its honages to the genre.	2003-08-23	2	2	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2NH4Z77A64LP	"S. Brown ""tinkkytone"""	Pirates of the Caribbean is a great movie based off a famous attraction at the California based DisneyLand.I remember being intrigued by this attraction as a kid, but the movie held me entralled. There were some slow parts and some elements of the movie could have been expounded upon. But, as it is, the feature is a little over two hours long. Had they gone into depth on everything then we would have never left the theater.The story begins with the finding of a young boy, floating amongst some ruble in the ocean. He is found by the daughter of the current governor of an English Province located somewhere in the Caribbean.Will Turner can remember nothing of his rescue, but he does remember the face of Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Over the years, his fascination grows to love. Yet, as a poor Blacksmith he knows that there will never be fruition to his desire. That is until the Black Pearl comes to coast causing death and destruction. Along this perilous journey, you meet a very drunken, and extremely hilarious, pirate by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp. Who also recieved an Oscar nomination for the role.The pirate ship, the Black Pearl, is hell bent, and the crew seem almost unholy in their power. What comes next is raucous, rolling adventure produced by Jerry Buckheimer. If you are familiar with the name then you should know what to expect.Purchase this movie as entertainment for the whole family. You will not be disappointed.	4.0	Very Good	2004-05-26	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3NPJ2XY3LXUOP	sc_demandred	Pirates of the Caribbean simply exceeded every expectation I had.  As a fan of pirate history and stories, I knew I would go see the movie.  However, I'm not a fan of marketing tie-ins, and figured that a movie based on a Disney ride would lack in all aspects other than Pirate Ships Shooting Cannons.Instead, I (and all viewers) were treated to a rollicking, humorous, and unapologetically fun film.  Johnny Depp is the rock around which this movie is crafted.  His captain Jack Sparrow is a loony buccaneer down on his luck, looking to steal a ship and go after his former crew.  Meanwhile, blacksmith's apprentice Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) crafts swords, practices with them, and burns with love for the daughter of the Governor of Port Royal (Keira Knightley).  When an ancient curse calls the legendary pirate vessel the Black Pearl to come and sack Port Royal, the adventures are underway.I'll say no more than that about the plot; if you haven't seen it, you deserve to enjoy the movie spoiler-free.  Johnny Depp really makes the film with his quirky staggering and wide-eyed mania, slurring and smirking his way through gleefully cheesy piratical dialogue.  Bloom and Knightley are excellent counterpoints, being both virtuous and yet intrigued by piracy.The DVD is stacked with extra features, including deleted scenes, featurettes, blooper reels, and more.  One of the more enjoyable bits is a documentary of sorts filmed by &quot;Pintel&quot; actor Lee Arenburg.  Arenburg takes a hand-held camera with him on set, and gives the viewer a neat look at both the filming of the movie and the cast and crew at play on location.The &quot;Fly on the set&quot; featurette is fun, too, as it lets the viewer watch from the side as certain scenes are slowly crafted from initial blocking up to and including pyro and falling sets.The special features add even more to what was already a movie worth owning.  If you like action, adventure, and humor all wrapped up in a package that almost all ages can appreciate, get this DVD.	5.0	As fun a movie as you'll see this year	2004-01-12	3	3	0

There are no unnecessary sexual scenes or f-bombs dropped here. Exactly what a good action film should be.Don't be fooled by the ride at Disney World. This isn't a bunch of animatronic pirates singing (though the famous ""yo ho"" song does make an appearance) and throwing water out at crowds. This is serious action and is highly recommended for anyone who likes a family-friendly movie with a good mix of special effects and drama.

Probably 95% of the population does not have widescreen TV, and yet the studios continue to force widescreen DVD's on us. Bless the few studios that put both versions(one on each side).  I, for one, refuse to buy widescreen DVD's.  And I will not buy VHS...get it Disney?  I don't buy your movie.  I rent the VHS and make a copy...now I've got the MPAA mad, and you could so easily make everyone happy, and yourself millions more to boot.  Now for the movie...Depp is incredible in the swashbuckler role, being funny, cute, debonair, and just an incredible actor.  The movie will keep you entertained throughout, and isn't that why we like movies to begin with.  Highly reccomend for those who buy VHS and those with widescreens...for everyone else(90%)of America, hold out till they realize they are missing the big picture(FULL SCREEN RELEASES!!!)FORGET THE ABOVE REVIEW!

Apparently it didn't have to get better, because it only got worse.  I won't say that it was the worst movie ever.

I had read several reviews and some said it was Great and some said it was poor.  I agree with the first review this movie is so well done.The movie opens with an eerie prolouge, then jumps right into the swashbuckling, and mystery of the plot.  Johnny Depp is great in his role of the not so loved Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow.  He is hilarious.  Orlando Bloom ( From The Lord of the Rings Movies) is wonderful as the black smith Will Turner who joins Jack Sparrow (Depp) in the epic journey to capture The Black Pearl to rescue  Elizabeth Swan the governers Daughter played brilliantly by Kiera Knightly.  The Captain of The Black Pearl is  Captain Barbossa who is played  by Geoffrey Rush.  Rush is evil comedic and the perfect fit.Overall this movie sweeps you off your feet and transports you into the epic jouney of action adeventure and comedy.The only possibly down point of the movie is the running time, running at an approximate 143 Minutes.Now to the Special Features.  The 2nd disc is full of fun facts and a 45 minute making of the movie.  There are around 7 Hours of entertaining  special features.

I always wanted to see a movie with pirates because I always wondered how it was to live in an time when they ruled all waters. And this movie was right on my order and it covers the fear of pirates and how they lived to enrich themselves.

I recommend buying this DVD simply because Johnny Depp does such an amazing job of portraying Capt. Jack Sparrow.  His voice, his mannerisms, and the way he handles each scene make him such a delightful on-screen presence.  This was definitely one of the more entertaining and fun movies of the summer and one any action movie lover should own.

I saw this in theaters 6 times because it was so good and I have been anxiously awaiting the DVD.  People say women like this movie because of Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, and I say true, but I love their performance, not their looks (Although they are both attractive gentlemen).  Johnny is at his comedic finest and you will not stop laughing and Orlando makes you root for the good guy even harder then normal and laugh at his comments that compliment Johnny's ""uniqueness"".  Geoffery Rush is phenomenal and so is the actor (I am blanking on his name, sorry sir, you were still awesome) who plays Commodore Norrington (he needs way more publicity, he was phenomenal as well)...This is by far the best movie of the year and without a doubt deserves awards for both content and actor performance.  Knowing the Oscars, it will get overlooked, not enough ""big names"" in some over the top boring movie, so my vote goes to them by buying the DVD and encouraging others to buy it as well.

Considering this i will use my knowledge of the culture to review the movie.Few people know this but Pirates of the Caribbean is based on a true story. My great grandfathers charactor is represented in the movie but I will not reveal it to avoid any legal trouble in the family. The movie is a fairly good representation of the pirate way of life, but not an exact documentary. To be percise pirates are drunk 94% of their lives, this is not shown in the film. Also pirates have a lot more sex than is shown. The director sliped in the scene where the ghost pirates kill all of the british soliders, though a ghost pirate can not be killed he can be defeated by an expert swordsman. A major downfall of the movie is the fact that the ghost pirates can not eat or drink successfully. A real pirate carries his ability to drink alcohol into the afterlife, therefore a real ghost pirate can (and will) get drunk. There are a few other misrepresentations of the pirate culture but overall this is a very good movie.	5.0	From one Pirate to the next.	2005-09-27	7	0	7

It's funny Disney almost gave him the axe for the way he portrayed the Captin, but  mostly it's his preformance that everybody loves. You got the felling her was one of thoes people who were so smart it makes them crazy.That and he's been living in his own little world far to long.  He was just so funny and hot. 2. Orlando Bloom.

But, most people who see it say it is for all ages and stuff. But, it is not!! The violence is way to menacing, the skelatons way to scary, there is to much blood, throat slittings, there is a scene when Barbossa is shot and they do a closeup of the wound while blood pours out, Barbossa also takes a knife while a closeup of Keira's hand is in view and cuits her hand open, and it is to confusing for children. Take my word for it, take your teens and yourself, but leave out the kiddies. Great movie though all in all.

His crew mutinied on him, dumped him on a deserted island, and now he is left with no ship, no crew, and no prospects...until he sees that his crew really is cursed.  Turns out his crew found the gold without him and now were like the living dead.  When Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) frees Sparrow so that they can rescue the fair Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) from the pirates, Sparrow realizes that the pirates need Turner's blood to lift the curse.  But Will is not about to let Sparrow use him as a bargaining chip and starts playing the game his own way...I was excited to see this movie from the moment that I heard about it, but I must admit that I was a little worried that it would be a weak adaptation like the Country Bears a while back.  Needless to say, I was blown away by this movie and was so pleased that Disney put out such a great movie!  The special effects are superb, with the pirates moving seamlessly between flesh and blood and skeletons in the streams of moonlight that they walk through.  The actors are also wonderful - especially Johnny Depp who was laugh out loud hilarious in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow.  The humor is not at all slapstick, though, it is very subtle and this makes it that much better.  Orlando Bloom did a very good job as the reliable blacksmith, Geoffrey Rush was the epitome of a bloodthirsty pirate and the British soldiers were a very nice casting addition.  In short, this movie has it all - great cast, wonderful effects, thrilling stunts and swordfights, humor, a love story, perfect sets and costumes, a lovely score - don't miss it!	5.0	A Pirates Life For Me!	2003-09-16	2	2	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2QQHIY23PL7H3	Simon	"Pirates of the Caribbean was the smash hit no one expected, making a blockbuster out of a long-forgotten genre, unlikely action leads, and a theme park ride as influence. Undead pirates have come to Port Royal to kidnap the governor's daughter (Keira Knightley) under the belief that she can free them from a curse placed by a chest of Aztec gold coins. A blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) enlists Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to rescue her. Depp's performance is now legendary, and the story is packed with good action set pieces that mix practical effects, stunts, and computer generated wonders. The film runs a little long, but is evenly paced so that it never becomes boring.Disney did a great job with this 2-disc set, which has commentaries, deleted scenes, and numerous featurettes on both the movie production and the theme park ride its based on. Some editions come bundled with a 3rd ""lost disc,"" but the best bonus material is already here.A great way to enjoy this adventure film, and worth viewing again as a primer before Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest."	5.0	Great crowd pleaser, great 2-disc set	2006-07-11	5	5	0

The film was much to long at 143mins. Few films justify being over 2 hours, and this film provided ample evidence of that.A waste of Johnny Depps undoubted talent.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A17QYA34K7OKUG	"""skc_33"""	"After seeing ""Pirates"" in the theaters three times this summer, my husband and I eagerly awaited the DVD release and the chance to have the movie all to ourselves.  The movie itself was widely recognized as one of the most entertaining films of the year, after most people expected it to be typical brainless summer blockbuster fare.  Fantastically over-the-top performances by Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp bring depth and meaning to what might have been an otherwise unspectacular action flick.  Depp's impeccable comic timing makes all of his scenes enjoyable, while Rush's insatiable Barbossa is both creepy and poignant.But on to the DVD extras:Keira Knightley and Jack Davenport give hilarious commentary on selected scenes; I wished their commentary existed for every scene in the movie, as it was preferable to the commentary from Johnny Depp and Gore Verbinski.  Verbinski rambles on about the writing of the movie (superfluous, since the writers' commentary is also available) and Depp seems more interested in watching the movie than giving any insight into his character or the experience of filming.  You feel as though he wishes Verbinski would shut up for a few minutes.The writers' commentary is definitely the most informative.  For example: The phrase at the end of the Tortuga pub scene between Sparrow and Gibbs (""Take what you can, give nothing back!"") is a phrase that was used by the actual sailors on the Lady Washington (the movie's ""Interceptor""). The writers also talk about what each actor brings to his or her role, how they adapted their characters, where the story comes from and what dialogue was improvised.  They also give hints about the eventual sequel.Some of the other extras are entertaining, but I would most recommend:Deleted and Alternate ScenesBlooper Reel (though not as extensive as one would hope)Diary of a PirateWalt Disney Archival material (you can see the original ride and its conception in the 50s!)Moonlight Scene Progression [*Hidden material on this page: press the down arrow until the pirate skeleton's tooth is highlighted, then press enter for a brief interview with the man who was Johnny Depp's inspiration for Captain Jack.]Disney comes through on this DVD with a closer look at the technology involved in the movie and the background and inspiration of the story.

That being said, he completely saved this film.  Had anyone else taken the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, this movie would have been unwatchable.  The plot is cookie cutter, and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, while very hot, is laughable.  It's pretty obvious that Will Turner is not supposed to be the guy we think rocks.  At least, I hope he isn't, cause he was pretty dumb.  In any case, Johnny Depp could deliver something written by Robert Jordan and make it seem like pure genius, and so the film wins out.  The cinematography is beautiful and the skeletons are pretty damn cool.  Geoffrey Rush does great as the pirate villain, and has his ""arrgs"" down perfectly.  This film is worth a viewing.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2Y70AOI3NG37J	"S. Koropeckyj ""Romi Panchir"""	Every now and then a movie comes out that when first watching it you may be entralled excited and in suspensful, and then at the end you ask; What happened to the movie? This is pretty much how I felt after seeing this film. I did not hate it nor did I really like it. I respect the opinions of all those people who did enjoy this film and will not attempt to put them down.The plot is most likely apparent to everyone thus I will not go into detail about it.The first major problem with this movie was simple; Disney was the company that produced this film. Thus many scenes like those in the pub or on the island could have beniffited from an R rating. Because this film was produced by Disney, it was obvious that there would be a happy ending. I am not really saying that all happy endings are bad, but the ending to this movie was simply much too sugary.This movie had far too many repetitions that were irratating by the end of the movie such as the 'parler' rule in the Pirate Code or the 'They are more like guidelines' phrase. I found all of these repetitions to be horribly irratating and put into the movie to provide a comic backdrop.Possibly the worst things about this movie were the gaping plotholes. Some other reviewers said that this film was nothing but a few action scenes put together and plot was just the afterthought, I would not be suprised if the actual movie was made like this. Amongst these plotholes and errors in logic was the Black Pearl's crew's ability to change into skelatal sepulchars. In their first appearence in the movie, which was at night, they were not skelatons but then other times when it was needed to scare the heroine they were. Furthermore in the big fight between them and the English army by the end of the scene there was not one British corpse even though the crewmembers of the Black Pearl were clearly winning the battle. And of course the movie had to include a battle scene between two people who could not die.Johnny Depp's acting was very good and his flamboyant character was in my opinion very funny and well constructed but the good characters end there. Orlando Bloom's character was horribly boring and uninteresting. And the pirate comic releif was nothing short of terrible.Aside from all of these problems the movie was fairly enjoyable on the first sitting.	3.0	For a Disney Film...	2004-04-14	4	3	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	"You've got to hand it to Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. They are a winning team of writers with a pretty good resume of flicks that they've combined on. Amongst others, they did the first two Pirates movies and are together again for 2007's upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End.And all of the key characters from Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) are back in Dead Man's Chest played by the same actors...with the same director (Gore Verbinski). That's usually the most important ingredient to a successful sequel. The main addition to Dead Man's Chest is Davy Jones played superbly by Bill Nighy (Nighy plays a great monster; I loved him as the vampire Viktor in the Underworld movie series).And all of the key players will be back for a quick return in 2007 with World's End. Can't wait.The effects in Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead Man's Chest are great. The movies are visually spectacular from CGI ghosts & sea monsters to at sea adventure to make up effects.There's lots of silliness in the Pirates movies, but it's deliberate. There's slapstick. There are death-defying feats. There's Johhny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrow) doing his best imitation of Keith Richards (true factoid, he has publicly commented that Richards is his Jack Sparrow character inspiration). But it all mostly works. After all, this is indeed supposed to be a movie for kids too, no?It's must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that this Disney theme park ride turned billion dollar movie franchise is getting PG-13 treatment. Kids 13 and under can see more violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Pirates. How is it that National Treasure (2004) gets PG and Pirates doesn't? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to ""protect"" our youth.I will indeed finish by saying that the first two of the Pirates series have grossed over $1,000,000,000 (that's a BILLION dollars) because they're good movies that kids can watch too. They're certainly not the best two movies in the world; in fact, Dead Man's Chest is probably more between a 3 and 4 star rating than the solid 4 star that Curse of the Black Pearl would earn alone. But numbers don't lie. People are drawn to this franchise. I am drawn to this franchise.As Davy Jones says, ""One soul is not equal to another."" So describes my view of the MPAA rating system to the next guy's, and so analogizes my opinion of Curse of the Black Pearl versus Dead Man's Chest. Bottom line: both movies offer a total of more than 4 hours of time that can be spent nuzzling up with your kids. Hence, my recommendation: add the Pirates series to your cart."	4.0	One Soul Is Not Equal To Another	2006-12-11	4	3	1

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A36PMFGBCBTBWI	Som3on3	"I seriously wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did. A pirate movie??? There's a lot of potential for lameness there. Like a lot of people, I decided that I wanted to see it because of Orlando Bloom (who definitely didn't disappoint!), but when the credits rolled I found myself with a new appreciation for Johnny Depp. I've liked a lot of his movies (Edward Scissorhands and What's Eating Gilbert Grape to name a few), but I've never really thought of him as one of my favorite actors. After seeing his witty, inventive portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, how could I not include him on my list of favorites? From the moment he sails onscreen in his leaky, sinking boat (an image hilariously juxtaposed with dramatic, majestic music), Johnny Depp owns this movie. Savvy???Anyway, enough about Johnny. I mean, I really can't say enough about the entire cast. Orlando Bloom (looking as handsome as ever!) plays Will Turner, a blacksmith who is somewhat reluctant to accept his pirate heritage. As the movie progresses, he does learn to accept it, which ultimately allows him to become the film's hero. Will lusts after the Governor's sophisticated yet spunky daughter, Elizabeth Swann (played by the gorgeous Keira Knightley). When Elizabeth is kidnapped by the cursed pirate crew (led by Geoffrey Rush as Capt. Barbossa) of the Black Pearl, Will has no choice but to team up with Jack Sparrow in order to find the Black Pearl and rescue Elizabeth. As you can imagine, much witty banter and swashbuckling action ensues. Yay! :)I got this DVD for Christmas, and I'm so glad I did! There are all kinds of cool extras, like video footage from the making of the movie, pirate facts and trivia, a blooper reel, deleted and alternate scenes, a few ""Easter eggs"", and insightful commentaries from both Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp. If your computer has a DVD-ROM drive, you can also pop in the discs to get access to more bonus material, including storyboards and the movie's script. Another kind of neat little feature is the ""Moonlight Becomes Ye"" effects studio, in which you can take a scanned photo of yourself and find out what you'd look like if you were a cursed pirate.Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl is really a must-see film. If for no other reason, see it for Johnny Depp's amazing performance, which was without a doubt one of the best of 2003."	5.0	The Curse of the Black Pearl	2006-07-01	2	2	0

It's got action, romance, and suspence all wrapped up in one ultimate, complete, rockin' extrvaganza! Johnny Depp was really funny and mezmorizing. So much he got an Oscar nod for it(sadly losing to Sean Penn for ""Mystic River"").They should have given some other nods for their acting like Best Supporting Actor for either Gefforey Rush or Orlando Bloom(but he'll probably get the Best Actor nod for the upcoming ""Kingdom of Heaven"" if it does well), or Keria Knightley for Best Supporting Actress(mabye she'll get a nod for ""The Jacket"").I was actually scared before I saw this movie(because of the skeletons), but when I first saw it, I actually had to admit that I liked it. So much, I saw it three times before getting the dvd. I recommend this to any one who love pirates in general and to any one who just wants a sense of adventure.And to the comment that they're making a second, I'm totally pumped!""Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl: See it!

Papagiannis ""djqwake"""	I have to say, this is one movie I could not find a single flaw with.  Excellent execution, and the film had a magical atmosphere.  This was especially apparent in the beautiful soundscapes, sweeping visual effects, and good storytelling with intriguing characters.  This was mainly a film of visual intrigue.  Port Royal (I beleive it's called) is just beautiful... both magical yet authentic in design, and I can see that care was taken in achieving authenticity of the time period in all aspects of the film.  Aethetics held up superblyRegardless of what anybody says, Johnny Depp IS Capt Jack Sparrow...it's in his blood.  Very comical yet serious and sometimes delusional, and brave yet a coward at times... perfect execution of the role down to the &quot;T&quot;.  Keira Knightley also very talented and well fitting for her role.... very beautiful I might add, almost enchating in a way like Johnny Depp's character.  Orlando Bloom's dialogue seemed a bit stale and reminiscent of his Legolas role, however he was well-suited for his role as Will Turner as well.  Geoffrey Rush is just one perfectly casted pirate hehe.Very good!  I highly recommend!!	5.0	Very awesome	2004-07-11	4	3	1

The special effects are critic-proof cheesy --- when they look bad, they're just right for the tone of the film. When they look good, they look good. (The ships, in particular, look great.) The other actors do a predictable but entertaining job as they talk about love and death and the importance of treasure. It's fun because it's so loose, but there isn't a moment when you think &quot;I'm watching a classic here.&quot; This is a modern day B movie.But Johnny Depp raises it to another level. His slurred speech, make-up, and costume are so over-the-top, he seems to be satirizing pirates while playing one. Depp is having fun, not taking one bit of this seriously, and the audience is in on the joke. If you ever want to make a point to someone about the importance of casting, just mention this movie. Without Johnny Depp, it would have sunk at the box office. With Johnny Depp, it became an accidental blockbuster, and with good reason: it's genuinely fun.	3.0	A surprise hit	2003-12-05	11	7	4

Johnny Depp as the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow is delightful and funny. The computer graphics are fantastic. There is plenty of action and romance without cursing or nudity. Small children may have nightmares from the skeletons but, after all, that is why it is rated PG-13. This movie encourages reading and history research.

Peg-legs, parrots, hidden treasure, plank-walking and plunging necklines... Now, that's what a pirate movie is about! It's all here, plus a good dash of ghostly horror, in the epic new adventure DVD release from Disney, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The $125 million supernatural swashbuckler is indeed loosely based upon the Disneyland ride we all know and love, but it's more of an homage than an adaptation. Director Gore Verbinski, with the help of his talented crew, got the look and feel of the ride just right... I could practically smell the fake fog and the phony gunpowder.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2W08HDAOZ9AG	Stephanie	I admit, like a lot of people, the main reason I went to see this movie was to see Orlando Bloom. I know I know, that's a bad reason to want to see something, but to tell you the truth, his part wasn't all that great.  He did a wonderful job with what he was given, but honestly I could think of a dozen actors that could have done his part, but I don't think a lot of actors can carry out that British innocence and strength that coincides so well with Bloom.Of course, the best performance was Johnny Depp.  It is one of the best performances of his career.  I used to hate Johnny Depp before I saw this film, but I have an entire new respect for him.  Geoffrey Rush I think was great.  He was a great villain.  I almost didn't want him to die in the end.  The only thing he felt in a long time was coldness and death.  Rush did a great job, some very amusing lines as well.Keira Knightly also did a very good job.  Her and Bloom are by far the years hottest stars, with some great films for both of them (Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King-Bloom, and Bend it Like Beckham-Knightly)I was pleasantly surprised by this film and now a big fan.  What surprises me is how many films I enjoy seem to all fit together.  For example, I believe that if you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings films, maybe even the Harry Potter books/movies, you will throughly enjoy this great summer movie.	5.0	Summer's Splash Hit	2003-10-02	0	0	0

Then I saw the finished product, and was amazed! The casting of the film was perfect, from Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow to Orlando Bloom's Will Turner. The action sequences, now a trademark of Jeryy Bruckheimer Films, are incredible, and ILM's horrid and disqusting dead pirate effects are brilliant.

My family, in anticipation of Pirates 3, decided to sit through a night of Pirates 1 and 2.  I had never sat down to write a review for either film as I only started writing these reviews since October 2006.  So here goes . . .I wish I can explain how much I enjoyed this film as adequate words escape me, but I have to try.  This film is great in that the performances were all top-notch.  Depp has a way about his style wherein you accept whatever he's doing even when you know he's giving you a playful wink, and I have to mention that he probably has the best entrance in a film that any leading actor could ask for from the writers.  All the other actors carry their roles with equal skill, charm, and charisma.  Well, maybe not exactly equal to Depp, but gosh darn close.In addition to the wonderful acting job the music supervised by Hans Zimmer is one of the best I have ever heard and captures the spirit of this film and genre wonderfully.  The script is well-written without any over-the-top slapstick elements that could have easily been injected into this film and would have sank the whole thing.  In addition, the special effects are mind-boggling and only enhance a great script, not attempt to replace it.  Again, that would have weighed this film down unnecessarily.With all that could have gone wrong with Pirates, it instead soars with brisk confidence which never loses direction and sails into first place for me as far as the enjoyment factor goes.  The director, Gore Verbinski, deserves much credit for steering this film into celluloid history.  A truly outstanding piece of entertainment for the whole family.  Well, almost ""all"", real little ones could be very frightened by the dead pirates.  In any event, this film is a true masterpiece and I'm still fuming over Depp not winning Best Actor at the Academy Awards that year as this was one difficult role to get right and he was simply perfect!"	5.0	"""Pirates"" Sails into History as One of the Best Films Ever Made!"	2007-05-21	2	2	0

Johnny Depp plays pirate captain Jack Sparrow in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, and he's a wonder to behold.  It's hard to tell whether he's doing a fey take on Keith Richards or he's imitating John Belushi imitating Joe Cocker, but whatever it is he steals this one.  Honorable mention should be paid to Geoffrey Rush, who plays Barbossa, Swallow's mutinous ex-first mate and current captain of the cursed Black Pearl with great panache and brio without playing up the camp elements.I really enjoyed PIRATES up until the time when the governor's daughter (Keira Knightley) is captured by the mutinous crew.  Maybe it was the CG animation of the skeleton crew in the moonlight that made me lose interest, but my attention took a long walk off a short gangplank right about then.  The interminable fight and heroine-in-peril scenes that followed didn't help any, either.I kind of doubt I was the intended audience for this one, and I imagine most people are going to enjoy the last half of PIRATES a lot more than I did.	3.0	Shiver me timbers	2004-05-25	3	1	2

Yes, it's true, no one gets hit in the crotch  and yet it's still a DISNEY movie. Absolutely shocking. Believe me and the other 1000 reviewers who said this is a great film. Buy it. You won't regret this one.	5.0	A Surprisingly Good Movie From Disney	2004-06-28	6	4	2
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1TW2JBAFXBZOK	Steven Meyers	My 15 year old told me to watch this.  I said OK to please her.  I was transfixed.  This is a tremedous viewing experience.  The story holds your attention the whole time and it is very creative.  Like a mystery that surprises at every turn.  Johnny Depp is absolutely charming.  I can't say enough about his performance.  He should win an award for this.  People should buy this just to watch him.  One of the best, absolutely best , perfomances by an actor I have ever seen.  The effects are astonishing, but tasteful.  The effects added to the story, not just effects for shock value.  The acting is first rate.  Children can see this movie, because there isn't one word or situation that is offensive to children.  A great movie without the usual dirt.  What a gift.  The whole family can see this.  However, it isn't a kids movie.  The story is very intricate and I never moved from the TV.  I will repeat.  I never said a word or looked away from the screen.  My daughter asked me if I was alright. That is how still and fascinated I was.  Buy this right now!!!!!!!!	5.0	STUPENDOUS - DESERVES AN ACADEMY AWARD	2004-01-21	5	4	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3A15B52GLZZK3	Steven Sloan	The Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best movies I have seen yet.  This movie keeps you entertained throughout it's entire duration.  From the witty comments and brain teasers that are given by Jack Sparrow, otherwise known as johnny Depp, to the exciting fight scenes, you are completely enthrawled in this movie.  Even if you are not satisfied with the film, you still can find a couple of key parts that are entertaining for you.The first scene is very catchy for the viewers.  The way they started it out, with the little girl finding the medallion on the boy, and then seeing the destruction of the pirates and their ship sailing away.  It makes you yearn for the rest of the movie, to be able to know what else is to become of the children and also for when you will see that ghostly ship of the pirates once more.  Then they cut strait to Jack Sparrow riding in on his sinking ship.  The look of confidence and strong will made me excited to watch the every move of his character and film work.Throughout the rest of the movie you are taken through many emotional, personal, and physical battles.  All the action keeps your eyes moving and your brain focused on what is happening.  You never get bored during this film because after every scene, you are left waiting eagerly for the next one and wondering what daft Jack Sparrow will do next.  The different ventures and quarrels are so exciting that you know you can always expect something great is to come.The ending is probably the most amazing part of the entire movie.  The fight scene, the plot and plan of Jack Sparrow that unravels through out the movie.  It throws you off guard when you see it.  You find out that some pirates can actually be great men and good people.  You see friendships made and rules bent.  You see fights and quarrels of long times brought to an end.  The ending makes you want more as you watch it come to the movies end.In conclusion, if you haven't seen this movie or think that you would not like it, you should see it anyways.  The colors and different artistic things catch your eye.  You are entertained during the movie, no matter what.  I saw this movie twice in theaters and twice since it has been released on DVD.  I can almost gaurantee that you will be satisfied.	5.0	Savy?	2003-12-05	4	4	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3U56M0Y8LYO6J	"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict"""	"Gore Verbinski's ""Pirates of the Caribbean:  The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a wonder of production design.  The props, sets, and costumes all look wonderful.  However, the film sinks because of uninspired directing and logic errors in the story that annoyingly grate on your mind.  In the end, this production stands exposed for what it really is - a shallow marketing tool created for the sole purpose of attracting more people to the Disney theme parks.A bitter rivalry between Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is re-ignited when the two men cross paths once again.  Barbossa is desperately trying to lift an ancient curse that has condemned him and his crew to continue living as undead pirates.  He has discovered that the key to ending the curse is a young man named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), but naturally Sparrow does not want to make matters easy for Barbossa so he decides to aid the youth.  A grand battle then erupts when the Royal Navy, in search of the missing Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), engages the cursed crew while Sparrow and Barbossa face-off for the last time.""Pirates of the Caribbean:  The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is another example of a film that is a slave to its special effects.  Its visuals look spectacular and lush on the big screen.  Especially impressive are all of the moments in which the cursed crew come into contact with moonlight.  Yet, there is only a skeleton of a story to connect all the big special effects-laden sequences together.  One gets the feeling that all of the action scenes in this film were storyboarded first and plot elements to link them together were added after the fact.  Depp and Rush perform admirably in their roles and are the only two performers who are able to do anything with the material given to them.  Less memorable are Bloom who is wooden from beginning to end and Knightley who exudes very little charisma in an underwritten part.  Furthermore, the characters played by Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport are one-dimensional caricatures and totally unnecessary.  Too bad the creative staff behind ""Pirates of the Caribbean:  The Curse of the Black Pearl"" couldn't loot a better director and a better script from elsewhere."	2.0	"""You seem somewhat familiar.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ALC40DW3Q5GEA	Stillsberry	"POTC: Curse of the Black Pearl was released in the summer of 2003. Like the first ""Spiderman"" it represented an optimistic attitude following the September 11th attacks. When released in theaters, I underestimated ""Pirates"" like most. But when I watched I was instantly taken by the fun flowing story and Johnny Depp's Comedic timing as Captain Jack Sparrow. The story is set into motion when Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) falls off a cliff into the water below. She wears an aztec gold coin around her neck and once it hits the water it calls out to pirates who need it to reverse a terrible curse on their lives. When they come to retrieve the coin Elizabeth is kidnapped. This event begins the plot to which Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) seeks to rescue her with the help of Jack Sparrow. While we wonder exactly who Jack is fighting for Will discovers his life is not always what he thought it was.The most common complaint of POTC 1 is it's too long. Maybe, but for me the length is justified. The action, including many sword fights, is creative and non repetitious. The story and how realistically grimy the people are should have made this tale too dark. But the genius of Johnny Depp not turning his role into something too serious; made Captain Jack Sparrow join the ranks of Han SolPirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl (Piano Solo Songbook)o."	5.0	Light Entertainment at the Dawn of Darkness	2010-07-09	1	1	0

His character also slips into his next movie - ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico.""My only annoyance comes with Keira Knightley.

And of course as always, he is nothing hard to look at on screen ;-).Geoffrey Rush was a good villian even if his role wasn't huge.  He had some good lines as well.Overall, the reason to go see this movie can be summed up in two words: Johnny Depp.  His performance alone is worth the 10 bucks you pay to get into the movie, savvy?"	5.0	a movie to be remembered	2003-08-04	11	11	0

Johnny Depp creates a character with such goofy charm that we don't even mind the Luke Skywalker-edness of Orlando Bloom.One of the interesting things about the film is the perception that the sets are real, that the boats are real, and that the explosions and stunts are real. The use of computer graphics seems to have been kept to a minimum, the important exception probably being the view of the ghouls preparing for attack by marching the ocean floor - a cool scene indeed. The other ghoul effects are also very cool - when moonlight touches the pirates their ghoul selves are revealed. This is done in a very spectacular cinematographic way, such as when Barbossa steps into the moonlight, uncorks a bottle of wine, and you see it flow through him. No wonder he looks on so enviously as Elizabeth tucks in to some real food, and Jack eats an apple."	5.0	Take what you can, give nothing back	2013-06-24	0	0	0

They weren't trying to dance around adult language by substituting in stuff that would keep it from getting an R rating...The movie just didn't need it.2) The special effects were amazing!

Finally, someone has produced an up-to-date pirate movie.I think this may be Johnny Depp's best performance, and to think that he actually had to convince Disney, who was about to have him replaced, to trust his instincts on how to portray Cap'n Jack Sparrow. I also liked Orlando Bloom's portrayal of Will Turner, the seemingly well-bred son of &quot;Bootstrap Bill&quot;, the notorious pirate.The story line is also fresh for a pirate movie - not just a lot of plundering, pillaging and swashbuckling. I won't give it all away, but the whole &quot;crew of the damned ship&quot; concept really worked for me.The DVD also has some pretty nice featurettes, including interesting material about the CGIs for the haunted ship and crew, and the ships that were used in the movie.The best thing of all - my kids love it. They watched it over and over for about a week and spent their time in-between viewings talking about it.I strongly recommend this movie for its fresh portrayal of pirates, good humor, action, and fine acting.

Johnny Depp is even more fabulous than ever (is that really possible!!!) and Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom make a smooth back-up and support for Depp's hilarious antics.  Orlando Bloom has several difficult moments throughout the film, acting wise, but he pulls through, which is pretty good considering his costars.  Keira Knightly makes a stunning debut, looking more beautiful and period appropriate than any hollywood starlet today.  The story is very entertaining and exciting, even if it's not the most brilliant film of the year, and the musical score is absoluetly perfect.  I reccomend this movie to anyone who is looking for a night of facinating and fabulous entertainment.  Even you self-proclaimed disney-haters will love this movie, because it is a excellent example of the magic that a good movie can bring.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2OO070GDF6ED4	Tarlie and Kristin	I viewed this film along with my two cousins (it was their second time). By the end of the movie, not only had we not realized that any time had passed, but also both Johnny Depp who played the adventurous Captain Jack Sparrow, and Orlando Bloom, the romance-seeking Will Turner, had captured all three of our hearts. For weeks after we searched for anything that had to do with the movie or these wonderful actors. If you saw three girls laying in the middle of a grocery store frantically picking through all magazines it was probably us! The plot had a lot of unexpected twists and kept us constantly on the edge of our seats, the actors were amazing (Johnny Depp's facial expressions are priceless!), and the special effects were fantastic!

Johnny Depp gives and EXCELLENT performance as Capt. Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush's character, Captain Barbossa, is and excellent villian in the flesh and as a skeleton. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly also give very strong performances.This is a must see film that has something for every member of the family.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1NHQFECVVL590	"""tennisgal018"""	"I have to admit it. When I first heard that Pirates of the Caribbean was going to be made into a movie, I brushed it aside as one of the ""B"" movies that come out during the summer purely for entertainment value. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!The story follows Capt. Jack Sparrow (Depp), Will Turner (Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) as they get caught up with Capt. Barbossa (Rush) and his ""skeleton"" crew while Barbossa is trying to lift the eternal curse that was placed upon his crew and himself. Of course there is much more to the storyline then that, but I don't want to give anything away for those who are going to go see it!Let me just say that Depp is simply hilarious and marvelous as Sparrow, and really adds a lot to the movie, and Bloom gives an excellent portrayl of Will Turner, a ""simple"" blacksmith apprentice who, surprise! makes elegant swords and ""pratices with them 3 hours a day"". Bloom's character goes through changes throughout the movie, making Turner a very intriguing role. You end up rooting for the characters by the end of the movie and will be delighted with all of the twists and turns the story really takes.The movie itself is also truly breath-taking. I believe that special effects are truly done well when you can't even notice them and this film really pulls it all off! I would HIGHLY recommend that you see this film on the big screen, as the effects would simply not be the same on a smaller TV or screen. I would kind of relate it to seeing Star Wars on a movie screen versus a TV screen. I believe it would be that big of a change, so see this movie while it is still in theaters!Finally, for all of you Disney-land goers out there, don't forget to look for scenes from the ride itself all throughout the movie. You have to look for some of them, but it is SO fun to spot things you can recognize from your childhood (or recent trip). :-)I would give this movie five stars and would like to applaud the filmmakers who brought it to life. It is truly a blend of action, drama, suspense, comedy, and romance (for the women out there), making it easily one of the best, if not THE best, movies of the summer."	5.0	Stunning	2003-07-11	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2HW4GC6H0L2LR	"T. George ""anne-with-an-e"""	When people talked about Pirates of the Caribbean, I was glad that a Lord of the Rings actor (Orlando Bloom/Legalos) was getting a chance to do another film.  HOWEVER, as the movie was to be based off a ride - A RIDE - I wondered whether the script writers of the film industry had lost it.  Are there not enough good books left out there?  Are people no longer creating worthwhile scripts?Protest aside, when some friends suggested we go, I went along with the crowd to see it.  I was expecting to be bored by an overly simplistic plot compensated by special effects and humorous but shallow dialogue.  Thus, I was in for a great surprise.  I absolutely loved it!  It is true that there isn't a whole lot of depth for the movie...but they scraped together enough to make one decent film.For those who don't know, the premise is that the blacksmith in an English port, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is &quot;secretly&quot; in love with the govenor's daughter, Elizabeth. She, in turn, is in love with him - they fell in love way back when Will, as a child, was saved from the wreckage of a burning ship.  This love may have laid dormant forever except for 2 things - the arrival of the pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Elizabeth's accidental summoning of the pirate ship The Black Pearl.  (Sparrow did not come with this ghostly ship, as they had mutineed against him, as it were.)From this explosive start begins a fairly fantastic adventure to save Elizabeth, to regain Sparrow's ship, and to make things right for everyone - including the pirates.  If it weren't for Sparrow's character, this may have just become boring and numbing.  However, Sparrow's character is so many steps ahead of everyone &amp; is playing everyone off each other to such an extent that you stay engaged as you try to figure what he's up to.  It isn't until the very end that you truly know which side he was working for.In fact, as has already been said, Depp really made this movie worthwhile.  Not only was his character well-written, but he brought this whole movie to life.  Everything about his character is perfect - the posture, the accent, the facial movements, his gait, his timing, his understated way of going about things.  You begin to realize that this whole plot hinges on him, but you're never really sure that you can trust him to bring it through.As for actors, Depp is one of the few I've found in the &quot;younger&quot; generation that can truly act - rather than just take type-cast roles.  To see him alone is worth it.  However, everyone else in the movie does their part well enough to allow for a very enjoyable time.The next question is...is there enough material to make a second movie from...?	4.0	Can A Movie Based Off a RIDE Be Good???	2003-12-31	1	1	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3KKPVZ2EQQLAB	The archduke	This is not a movie that will change your life, nor is it a film that will have you sitting around a coffee shop discussing the vast intellectual ideas presented to you on the screen. But it is fun, entertaining and witty, something that so many Hollywood blockbusters have been missing over the past few years. This is an adventure movie on the high seas and the beautiful locales of the Carribean islands, that will keep you thoroughly entertained right through until the end.The casting in this movie is excellent, and Johnny Depp really steals the show with his Keith Richards-esque pirate. Geoffrey Rush is always good, Orlando Bloom is a fast rising star, as is the beautiful Keira Knightley, who will surely be appearing on more of our local screens with her string of success including &quot;Bend it like Beckham&quot;, &quot;Pirates&quot;, and &quot;Love Actually&quot;.The DVD offers alot of good behind the scenes vignettes, enough to keep the lovers of this movie busy for quite some time. I believe this movie will continue to entertain for many years to come, so it is a worthwhile purchase for those who like adventure flicks.	4.0	Hollywood can still be fun	2003-12-06	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3P7ERFJUWNXVN	The Birdman	When i hear the name Disney, i usually think &quot;DISmal kid's noise&quot; or &quot;DIS movie will remain in my memory for about three seconds&quot;. The bottom line is, without Pixar to save it's face every year it releases a movie, Disney would be lying dead in a pool of it's own Mickey Mouse.That is, of course, until they bankrolled this, their best live action film ever. which, co-incidentally, is also the best pirate movie ever and the funniest film of the past year.Pirates of the Carribean is long, no question, but it's entire girth is thrust full of humour, cool action, art direction to make you bow down and worship it, and the kinds of performances to make it unforgettable.Written by the people who wrote the script for Shrek, the dialogue is fresh, edgy, but intelligent and damn funny. Gore Verbinski directs the affair with panache and aplomb, lending each scene a kind of exotic beauty, and making great use of the aforementioned art direction, and the Hans Zimmer/Klaus Badelt score (Badelt also scored Equilibrium, trivia fans).But the heart and soul of this film is it's cast. Johnny Depp cements his status as the greatest modern actor of the US, while Orlando Bloom continues his love affair with period (this and Lord of the Rings), he is ably supported by the ham flavoured stylings of Geoffrey Rush as the &quot;A-HAR!&quot; villain, Keira Knightley as the requisite love interest, and some other fine British talent who deserve to be in more movies.Again, the action is too much of a good thing, but it is grandiose, epic, and doesn't lose humour in place of explosions like other movies, making you laugh and gasp by turns.So, drink up me heartys, and set this one out to sea for one of the best times you will ever have with a Disney movie.	5.0	The best pirate movie i've ever heard of.	2004-04-28	2	0	2

Johnny Depp has broken a new threshold in on screen performance. Keira Knightley is a fresh breath on the big screen with her charms, beauty, and excellent performance.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2I29YY8T7PVLZ	the_frog	Pirates of the Caribbean is regrettably based on a Disney ride. Okay, we got that out of the way. The good news is that the movei features immensely enjoyable work from Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, as the usually-protagonist Caption Jack Sparrow, and the evil Captain Barbossa, respectively. Depp's Keith Richards inspired pirate steals the show, in spite of frequent darkly funny lines from Barbossa. Also appearing in the film are the beautfiul and talented Keira Knightley, the too-talented-to-be-in-this-small-a-role Jonathon Pryce, the solid Jack Davenport, and the wooden but physically gifted (and hot, I am told) Orlando Bloom.Recoginizing where the fun the movie lies, Director Verbinski focuses on the antagonism between Barbossa and Sparrow, and Sparrow's good-natured ribbing of everyone else. The movie does a good job of not letting too much times pass between swordfights, and staying light on its feet, and stays enjoyable throughout. By no means a great movie, it is an enjoyable way to spend the afternoon, and something you will want to again, to catch some of the more subtle jokes.This transfer is gorgeous, with rich colors and clean lines. The three commentary tracks are okay, not great. The other features are numerous, though middling in quality. By the way, does any non-Pixar movie have a good blooper reel? This doesn't, and the deleted scenes should remains so.Buy this DVD for the movie, not the special features.	4.0	An enjoyable, if lightweight, few hours.	2004-01-03	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A27MOT4ZIUAKIW	The Jaundiced Eye	"Enough has been said already about Johnny Depp's incredibly original performance....he both steals and makes the movie. If he had played the character straight, it would have been safer but a lot less enjoyable. I've got to wonder what everyone on the set must have thought when he showed up on the first day of shooting...$125 million on the line and your high-dollar, sexy, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. leading man shows up with catfish whiskers, impersonating Keith Richard in drag. The producers probably fainted....but thank god they had sense enough to let him proceed.Geoffrey Rush (Capt. Barbossa) gives him a run for his money in some scenes, but Johnny rules the roost when it comes to creating bizarre characters.I thought the movie seemed a bit long, with some redundant situations, but must admit that it was generally entertaining and amusing throughout, with some really great moments and dialog.I was, however, somewhat distracted by Keira Knightley's lips....collagen OD??....and her incessant pouting. Someone must have told her that this would make her sexy and irresistable....they lied. Maybe she felt that since ""Keith Richard"" was going over so well, she would throw in a little Mick Jagger. Fortunately, the drunken beach party with Captain Jack restored her to my good graces, but for god's sake, Keira, lay off the collagen.Buy, rent, borrow, or steal the DVD...it is a truly clever and entertaining 143 minutes. This, like the pirate's code, is not an inflexible demand....it is simply a ""guideline""."	5.0	Superb Movie !!!  Keith and Mick steal the show !!!	2005-07-17	2	2	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A5TZXWU8AALIC	The JuRK	I'm amazed that Hollywood finally made a decent pirate movie.When I was a kid, SWASHBUCKLER (1976) was a major disaster.  Robert Shaw, riding high after the biggest summer blockbuster ever, JAWS, starred in a pirate movie that killed any hope of this genre setting sea ever again.  I can't remember when Roman Polanski directed PIRATES but it also sank into the abyss.When I'd heard that a movie was coming out based on the Disney ride...I had doubts.  But then Johnny Depp was starring, so I figured there would have to be something interesting to attract him.It's a fun summer movie.  The story is constructed like an amusement park ride, more for effect than any real thought.  The special effects are top-notch and there's enough humor to keep things sailing along.	4.0	The First and the Best	2009-03-18	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	APRZ2IVM8JTLV	The Mysterious Traveler	PIRATES OF THE CARRIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL Directed by Gore Verbinski. Script by four writers(always a bad sign. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, Jonathan Pryce and Geoffrey Rush.An overproduced overly complicated far too long Pirate horror film in which a pirate, a hero and a heroine encounter a pirate ship crewed by the living dead who need the blood of their betrayer(or his sons) and a final coin to free themselves from a terrible curse.After beginning reasonably well, the film opens fire with an endless barrage of constant stuff that finally becomes boring. Every scene has to be a high point. Every line of dialogue exceddingly clever and witty and everything in the picture eventually turns out to have some signifigance giving the whole thing a terribly contrived and preassembled feel. The action sequences...especially the duels are uninspired and dreary(compare same with, for example, SHANGHAI KNIGHTS) and go on and on and on. The plot occaisionally makes no sense.......but after a point the viewer ceases to care. The performances from Depps one note repetative imitation of Keith Richards to Blooms is dull as dishwater hero and Knightlys annoying in that modern feminist heroine way........and is a dull heroine singularly uninteresting or likable. Rush is okay but he is doing a Robert Newton impersonation.This would have been a much better film with, at least, a half hour--if not an hour chopped from it but at nearly 2 and 30, it is too long by far. The kind of film Universal-International used to make in their sleep in the 50s with Tony Curtis and Maureen OHara but now modern Hollywood can't even manage awake.Not bad. Not good.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A10VNTUCKHAAIH	"T. Henderson ""filmphan"""	"I was let down by this movie. Why? Because I figured that Gore Verbinski, fresh off the fantastically creepy ""The Ring,"" would attack this film like a full-fledged horror film. At least that's what the teaser trailers lead me to believe. Instead, the film is more a mixture of action movie and comedy. But then, the movie is based on a ride at Disneyworld; so, really, how scary could it be? Regardless of my letdown, I was entertained by what I had seen. This film is definitely the first 'adult' film of the summer to feel easily accesable to all who went to see it. I didn't have to explain to my friends a whole bunch of background info going into the movie, like who the Hulk was, or why Morpheus speaks like my Logic teacher from college, or why Arnold is continually sent back through time to save some loser. The movie's fresh ideas are quite nice in a summer of sequels. I have always had a soft spot for the swashbuckling epics, and although this isn't one, it satisfied me nonetheless. The main reason had to be because Johnny Depp is one of the better actors around, and that he can steal every scene from even the most so-so pirate movie, and turn it into a highly entertaining popcorn flick. Depp's performance, as with ALL his movies, is worth the price of admission alone. Just turn off your brain, you don't need to think too hard to get the obvious jokes and one-liners, but you will have fun...that I can assure you. Even with its flaws, and lack of horror, I will be anxious to see Depp do a sequel to this film as his character is one of the most loveable movie pirates since Han Solo. Despite the violence, this is one of the better family films of the summer. YARRRR!!!"	3.0	Not An Epic, But Fun To Watch	2003-07-16	11	1	10

The black pearl is cursed with the crew eternally between life and death.

I really do mean ""fun"".  Most movies just don't have that ""pure fun feel"" to them - they either get too serious or too stupid at times.  Pirates remains constant throughout the entire film with hilarious scenes from Johnny Depp and tons of action sequences.  But Johnny Deep steals the show.  His character, Jack Sparrow, is so much fun to watch and extremely hilarious.One or two cheesy scenes are thrown into the movie and the 2 hour and 15 minute total time may seem a bit long, but the plot shifts often enough to keep you entertained.  Another cool part of the movie is when the skeletons are revealed in the moonlight from the pirates - its a really cool effect.This is the only movie other than Harry Potter that I have gone a second time to see, and I had a better time watching it than the first time.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2M597GCCE1N2S	"the one and only ""david"""	Pirates of the Carribean was a great, action/comedy movie back in 2003. Johnny Depp proves why he is one of the greatest actors in movies today, and shines in this movie as Captain Jack Sparrow, considered one of the worst pirates that ever lived in this story.The story itself is very intriguing, and throws in little twists here and there that keep the movie moving at a great pace and leads up to a great action ending. But I am getting ahead of myself. Orlando Bloom also stars as Will Turner, a young man who was found years ago when he was a boy in a shipwreck by Elizabeth Swan, Keria Knightley. Now years later, he is an ironsmith apprentice, who secretly loves Elizabeth, but cant come to say it out loud.When a ship called the Black Pearl, considered by many to be just a myth, attacks the port that Elizabeth lives in, Elizabeth takes it to herself to demand the pirates leave. To do this she realizes the only way for the pirates to leave is to give them a mysterious gold coin that they seem to so desperately want. She gets her wish, but is also taken aboard the Black Pearl and cant escape. Will teams up with Jack Sparrow, who was in prison at the time of the attack, and they set off to rescue the lovely Elizabeth.It turns out the pirates are actually skeletons! Cursed to wander the earth until they can return all the pieces of Aztec gold they stole years ago. That was where the gold coin comes in. Teamed up with a ragtag group of pirate friends, the two lead characters follow close behind.The movie is great and the scenery really does look like it has come out of the ride at Disneyland. There are a lot of jokes and funny moments that never get dull. The fight scenes are great, and all three main characters have their moments in this movie. Add in some touching moments between Will and Elizabeth, and a great ending, and you get the best movie of 2003!	5.0	Best pirate movie ever made!	2004-09-04	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1NSUJJCG73IRF	"The Tweeder ""tweeder16"""	"Director: Gore VerbinskiCast:  Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook.Running Time:  143 minutesRated PG-13 for action/adventure violence and brief language.Despite being rife with technical blunders such as the longest full moon in history, Disney's first non-PG film is proving to be a financial boon while at the same time collecting reviews from critics that run from tepid to red hot. I am in complete agreement with Roger Ebert on one point: Somewhere in this 143 minute tour de force there lurks a very good ninety-minute film.  Other than Johnny Depp, who fashioned his character's personality (and eye makeup?) after observations of his good friend Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, the cast of 'Pirates' reads like a Who's Who of English film actors, including Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport and Mackenzie Crook.  When screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio originally pitched the movie to the Disney executives in the early '90s, Disney rejected it. It makes one wonder just who is running the Disney Empire. Universal Studios have been combining action/adventure movies with theme park rides for over two decades (""E.T."", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Jaws"", and ""Back to the Future"" to name a few) only in reverse order-first the film, then the ride. This combination has worked well for Universal, and it seems almost absurd that Disney has taken so long to pick up on the obvious.Situated in the British, Caribbean colony of Port Royal, Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) wishes to live the life of a pirate and not a governor's daughter, while her admirer, the impoverished blacksmith, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), wishes to deny his own pirate roots. Then, a once mischievous Captain Jack Sparrow (played brilliantly by Johnny Depp) enters the town with his agenda of rounding up a crew, stealing a British naval ship and retrieving his rights as captain of the Black Pearl pirate ship, havoc ensues.  The entrance of the damned Black Pearl's crew into Port Royal is quickly summoned by the last missing piece of treasure, which calls them when Swann falls into the water with it (a gold coin) wrapped around her neck. The pirates sac the town, stealing Swann and headed to return the treasure and break their curse. The chase is on, once Turner springs Sparrow from jail, for the ship and its desired possessions. The hero's luck runs out, but just when all hope is lost, Sparrow devises a plan to save his ship, get Will his girl and escape the grips of both the cursed pirates and dim-witted British navy.Filled with an excellent cast and first-rate special effects, ""Pirates"" makes it easy to truthfully accept the unbelievably fantastical events of the film including sword fights, pirate ships on the open seas, cannon warfare, and caves of treasure. Director Gore Verbinski brings out the best of his actors, who enable the sometimes-cheesy script to flow smoothly and as convincing dialogue. Depp's typical ability to create a quirky and enchanting character is again fulfilled in his drunken pirate role. He illustrates the character's bad luck but determined nature, making him the admirable good/bad guy. Depp's humorous line delivery and outstanding timing nicely accompany his scruff appearance, adorned with eyeliner, a bead-embellished wig, and braided goatee.  Rush also performs his role of the evil pirate convincingly and with his usual gifted acting talent. Bloom slips nicely into his usual typecast role as the love-driven romantic young lad, and his opposite, then seventeen-year-old, British actress, Knightley brings the adventurous, bold, and beautiful identity of Swann to life.  Though none of these characters exist in the Disney adventure ride, there are two similar scenes that lovers of the ride will recognize, one being the stop at pirate infested Tortuga Island. The storyline does become a bit boring and redundant, as the minutes turn to hours, creating the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Yet, the scheming scoundrel Jack Sparrow saves the day, and the audience's attention only to sacrifice himself to capture by the Royal Navy. Don't worry, though, it all ends well as a good Disney movie should.  Splendid, superb Hollywood fun."	4.0	The Pirates of the Caribbean:  The Curse of the Black Pearl  (2003)	2006-04-01	3	2	1

Johnson	To be honset I was never really too keen on watching Pirate movies especially one made by Disney. But I have to say this is the best pirate movie I've ever seen, It has action, great fight scenes, great story, great sets and great actors.  Johnny Depp is so funny as Captain Jack Sparrow, he had me laughing throughout the entire movie.  Orlando Bloom proved that he can be more than just a pretty elf with an arrow, He was wonderful!  Keira Knightly was fantastic!  Everyone was!  The dead pirates weren't too creepy but then again it's Disney.  But there is some creep factor in watching them on the ship and later on in the movie.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1V51M8M216Y69	"T. Hooper ""thdizzy"""	Pirates of the Carribean is a real treat for people of all ages.  It's been a long time since Hollywood has made a pirate movie worth watching, and this one is a visual feast.  It's filled with all the sword fighting, ship boarding action you could ask for.  It has a very authentic feel and it's not at all childish as you would expect of a movie based on a Disney attraction.What makes this movie really stand out is the performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.  He is inspired in the rile and really makes it his own.  Without Depp, this movie wouln't be as good as it is.  He really steals every scene he is in.Another point that makes this great is the attention to detail.  Whether it's Port Royale, or a pirate's ship, you just have to be amazed at the quality of the production.  You can really imagine you're there.  In particular, the scenes of ship to ship battle, with cannons blazing, are some of the most exciting scenes in the movies today.  If you love action or adventure, this is a must have for your DVD library.	5.0	Thrilling	2004-01-03	1	1	0

My friends often laugh at me and said that I liked this movie mainly becuase I love Johnny Depp (Jack Sparrow) and Orlando Bloom (Will Turner.) It's true *drool*. However, their skills as actors also deserve an standing ovation.In the movie, Depp plays a rogue pirate and his actions and his banters with other characters are just hilarious. Bloom, as a blacksmith in the movie, stood steadily for justice and law, yet he displayed a strong faith in love and most importantly - friendship. The villan, Captain Barbosa, played by the accomplished actor Geoffery Rush was another plus to the movie.Another complement for the director is the life-like computer animations and graphics. Because the pirates of the Black Pearl is under a curse fo the Aztec Gold, they turn into skeletons under the moonlight. The computer crew did a wonderful job to manipulate the movement of the bones of the pirate skeletons. It's great!Have you ever been on the Disney pirates ride?

It's not a kids movie although it's perfectly fine for kids as well.It's a nice throwback to the kind of swashbuckling pirate movies of the 40's.  Johnny Depp is fanatastic in his over the top performance of the slightly foppish and drunk, Captain Jack Sparrow.  Jack is trying to get his ship back from a rival pirate played by Geoffrey Rush.Orlando Bloom is along and actually does most of the swashbuckling as he tries to rescue his love from Rush and joins forces with Depp.Maybe slighly scarey for very young kids as Rush's crew turns to skeletons in the moonlight due to a curse which they are trying to lift.Great battle sequences with the vintage ships and strong swordfights.  Romance and comedy thrown in to boot.  A rousing adventure.The DVD has many very good extras including multiple commentaries, deleted scenes, making of feature, pirates history, and more.	4.0	EXCELLENT PIRATE TALE	2003-12-19	0	0	0

Though the violence could be kept down a little more...it's still a fun family movie. Every family likes humor and this movie has lots of it, you just have to listen for it.

What people don't understand is that just because there are good actors in a film, doesn't mean that the film will necessarily be good. I think that the movie has gained lots of hype partially due to the fact that Orlando Bloom is in it. Excuse me, but just because he may be attractive(I, personally, like men like Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean, big tough guys who don't run around and prance in forests), doesn't mean that this movie will be great.

We have all seen just how bad video games translate, so I figured this wouldn't be any different.  I was dead wrong.  I can rarely watch something with my kids that I actually LIKE as well.  This was an excellent movie with a great plot.  It was more &quot;fun&quot; than anything.  I wasn't moved to tears or made to think, but man did I have a good time.  So did my kids.

This is without a doubt not only the best movie of the year, but probably the best movie I've ever seen. I first saw the promos for it on TV, and I didn't hold high hopes for a pirate movie based on a ride in Disney World. I WAS SO WRONG. I have lost track of how many times I have seen this movie, mostly thanks to Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp's performance is unique, hilarious, and endlessly entertaining. I love it. Because of this movie he has a new fan, and I would have to guess I'm not the only one. His charater, Jack Sparrow, is my favorite movie character ever. Orlando Bloom portrays the role of Will Turner marvelously, and you can literally watch him transform as his character makes a switch from humble blacksmith to pirate. Keira Knightley is a wonderful actress, she plays the role of Elizabeth almost flawlessly. Also, this movie has the best fight scene ever, a sword fight between Jack Sparrow and Will Turner in the blacksmith shop. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. Johhny Depp's performance will have you laughing the whole movie, the action will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the plotline will have you guessing until the end.

Johnny Depp is absolutely awesome in this fun pirate flick, with his wonderfully OTT performance as the sexy (and weird) Cap'n Jack Sparrow.  This is a hugely fun film, the kind that unfortunately seems to be made very seldomly these days (not ""serious"" enough..).  Fantastic that Johnny won awards for this part (and was even nominated for an oscar!)  Also starrring Geoffrey Rush as a demented (and ghostly!) pirate captain, Sparrow's nemesis.  Orlando Bloom returns from MIddle Earth to do a tad of sword fighting - where's that bow & arrow, ""Leggie""?  Keira Knightly, who first came to notice in Bend it Like Beckham is one of the very few females in the film and is accordingly quite lovely - at least the fellas have one pretty girl to look at...

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A5CWLQF6QO3CN	"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B..."	Haven't thought of pirates movie would be able make it back again in the modern days, especially when we are talking about we are in the age of Si-fi and fantasy movies that rely heaps on state-of-the-arts computer special effects. Nontheless Pirates of the Caribbean made a good return of the genre to the audience.Frankly, judging from the dodgy and lengthy title, there was not much hope about it being either entertaining or creative. However, with Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom as the leading cast, the attraction of the movie rocketed immediately. Johnny Depp, playing the weird ex-pirate head who got dumped on an isolated island in the middle of nowhere provided a lot of essential credits to the movie. His performance is stunning and spectacular and managed to turn this old jerk into a half-weighted hero. His gestures and all the small movements he created for the character did add a lot of spice to make the character jump out of the script. Johnny Depp once again proved that he could transform any roles into a real character that could last in people's mind.Geoffrey Rush as the cursed power and wealth hungry pirate provided a lot of dynamics to the movie, especially when he was working with Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley. The whole movement of the story just came in and pushed the plot forward. Although working will strong actors like Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, the two young cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were not worse off in performance. They showed great integrity in their characters and were able to match with their strong counterparts perfectly. Orlando Bloom still needs time to shake his Legolas image off, but everything needs to have a start and it seems that this is a good start for him. Keira Knightley showed huge difference when compared to her role in Bend it Like Beckam. Both of them should have good chance in the acting career should they be able to choose their roles carefully in the future.The special effects of the movie concentrated on the transformation of the cursed sailor crew at different occasions and they were well done. It provides a creepy feeling in certain scenes and at other scenes created a haunting effect for the audience.The story itself is a bit simple but in all is a very entertainment movie for just sit back and relax.	4.0	A pleasant surprise	2003-10-28	1	0	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"Our memory is still fresh about ill-fated ""Tresure Planet.""  It seems nobody wanted to see pirate movies these days, even animations.  Did someone go  to see not-so-bad-but-just-ok ""Cutthroat Island"" back in 1995?  Then, Jerry Bruckheimer thought about making one, casting Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Geoffrey Rush.  The result is, surprise! very entertaining family picture.It is Johhny Depp as Jack Sparrow, quite a 'unique' pirate walking and talking like heavily drunk rock musician, who is the real power of the film.  Jack and serious and sober citizen Orlando Bloom's Will Turner join force to hunt down the cursed ship Black Pearl, whose captain Barbossa kidnapped Elizabeth Swann, beautiful daughter of the admiral, with whom, of course, Will is desperately in love.The writing team of ""Shrek"" provides a story which is pretty  unpredictable -- see how Depp enters the story -- so, many familiar rules of pirate moviers are preserved, but the use of them is often surprisingly fresh.  The film is peppered with tongue-in-cheek acting of Depp and Rush, and director Gore Verbinski does his job quite well, knowing that this is originally a Disney amusement park attraction.Fighting scenes are well-crafted, but tend to look too long and drawn-out sometimes, and the film's 144 minutes are slightly overlong (Mr. Verbinski's habit, I am afraid).  But the final result is quite satisfactory, good enough to erase the bad name of pirates in movie industry in Hollywood that goes back to the 1980s.  And Ms. Knightley is very charming (though I prefer her in ""Bend it Like Beckham"").Actors like Jonathan Price appear, but basically this is Johnny Depp's film.  And most of all, this is a great entertainment only Hollywood can make (and don't miss the true ending after the end credit).  They should do more films like this."	5.0	Great Fun; Exciting Actions and Fantastic Cast	2003-09-09	4	3	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AVGGEAI1YGSAP	Tucker Andersen	This movie captures just the right mix of action, adventure, romance and comedy. Johnnny Depp is marvelous as Captain Jack Sparrow, who arrives in Port Royal aboard a sinking boat after being left to die on a desert island by his mutinous crew.  He is looking for a way to regain his ship, The Black Pearl, from Captain Barbossa , the leader of the mutiny who is played wonderfully by Geoffrey Rush. Sparrow rescues Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) from drowning in a hilarious scene, but is recognized as a pirate and sentenced to be executed. However, Barbossa and his crew (who are unaware that Jack Sparrow has survived) invade Port Royal in search of an Aztec gold piece that is the key to their future and kidnap Elizabeth for reasons that become clear  as the story unfolds. While Elizabeth's father, the island's governor (Jonathan Pryce) and her apparent fiancee, Commander Norrington (Jack Davenport) debate what to do, Jack is freed from prison in the confusion following the attack. He joins forces with blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth's friend since the time when as a young boy he was spotted at sea by Elizabeth floating on a raft and rescued following a pirate attack. (As you can surmise, the love triangle between Elizabeth, Will, and Norrington forms the crucial romantic element of the story.)Will wants to save Elizabeth, Jack Sparrow wants to regain the Black Pearl, Norrington wants to capture Jack and hang him, the Governor wants his daughter safely back home, and Barbossa and his men want to escape from the curse which has been placed upon them.  This curse turns them into skeltons in the moonlight, which is wonderfully done through computer generated special effects (CGE's) and is the basis for both many of the great action scenes and also in some cases the comedic aspects of the film. (The story line also deviates somewhat from standard pirate fare in that it is also tough to fight opponents who in effect can't be killed.)Director Gore Verbinsky plays the story for action and fun, it is very stylized and makes no attempt to appear realistic. There are also several great scenes with some of the minor characters that add to the fun. After all, you would expect pirates to be a little eccentric on occasion. In addition, the CGE's allow this film to build on the pirate movies of decades ago rather than simply imitate them. There are a few scenes that might startle or frighten a young child (one scene with the monkey made me jump in my seat), but in general the violence is just old fashioned pirate scenes much less threatening than most video games. The only problem that I had with the movie was that there were so many elements to the plot that it runs approximately two and a quarter hours. This was the reason that I did not give it five stars but it was a close call. (The length bothered my wife more than it did me.) I want to emphasize strongly that none of that time is boring. However, some of the battles might have been edited a little more tightly. In conclusion, if you want to enjoy yourself, go see PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN  and find out if Jack Sparrow can outwit Barbossa and regain The Black Pearl while  reuniting Will and Elizabeth.	4.0	(4+) LOTS OF SWASHBUCKLING FUN AND ADVENTURE	2003-07-21	1	1	0

A humorous, action-packed pirate movie that had everything work out just fine. And Johnny Depp... is there anything he can't do? The man's a gifted actor and this movie only adds more credibility under his name. Orlando Bloom's acting wasn't too shabby as well, although I thought of his character as a bit annoying. The lovely Keira Knightley has since then become famous due to this movie. Job well done for her, although her character came off a bit annoying as well. And let's not forget Geoffrey Rush, yet another talented actor. I wonder how he landed this role... no matter, because the man also did a fine job.The special-effects reminded me of how both recent ""Mummy"" movies were. And acting with no characters around isn't anything new. Remember when Brendan Fraser did that in the first ""Mummy"" movie? The pirates' CGI desings also looked similar to the mummies. And of course, the pirates' silly personalitites are seemingly similar to the mummies. Unfortunately, the pirates triumphed over the mummies.Looking at ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" now, I now noticed how similar the movie was to ""The Mummy"" or for that matter, ""The Mummy Returns."" The heroes in both flicks are kinda silly but still good-looking men for girls to drool over. The heroes in both movies have to rescue a ""damsel in distress,"" thwart evil and rotting henchmen, and put an end to a curse. The only difference? A small love triangle that formed for a while in ""Pirates,"" but seems unnoticable to most viewers.But does anyone give a care? Heck no! ""Pirates"" was better than one expected it to be. Though it may seem a bit too long, ""Pirates"" is a movie that you'll sit through and keep you entertained.The DVDs features are also for those hardcore DVD enthusiasts. Cast and crew interviews, behind-the-scenes, etc., etc. All there to keep one interested in how ""Pirates"" came to be.So sit back with a bottle of rum (or some other substitute drink) and enjoy the hit blockbuster ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."""	5.0	A Silly Pirate Movie That's Enjoyable	2004-11-23	5	2	3

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AWRGM17GTMND8	"Tyler S. ""Super-Review"""	I've always had great feelings when watching this film.  For its time it was so original and longed for in an age where everything felt replicated and copied.  Thankfully they have quickly released the trilogy on Blu-ray without shortchanging us in quality or features.So you probably already know by now how much you like this film, but you're wondering whether to get it on blu-ray.  I'll tell you then quality is fantastic and I couldn't spot any defects.  The special features carried over and most of those are pretty fun.  The sound is stellar to compliment the picture.  And last but not least, it just looks good in your collection with the matching sleeves and set up.  I'll be getting the other two films in the series in the near future.The only complaint I would have, is that some of the features are a little over the top.  Anyone who watches special features most likely won't like little games and treasure hunts.  We just want segments of behind the scenes and one commentary.  On this Blu-ray we have three commentaries(two too much) and a bunch of useless special features aside from the good ones.  That is my only shrug about this release.#1 in the franchise will always be the best.  Even if you did not like the other two, I see Curse of the Black Pearl essential to any Blu-ray collection.	5.0	Pirates in Blu Makes for a Swashbuckling Good Time	2010-05-17	4	3	1
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2UCFKHDPSEZC6	"""ugluk_the_great"""	&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; is genius. Really. Unlike Lord of the Rings, which attempted to be a serious movie, but really wasn't, &quot;Pirates&quot; go through the whole story with laughter, originality, and best of all - Johnny Depp. It's not a movie that's good because it's made good by an actor. No. It's just that Johnny Depp performs so well and blends into the story that he makes the story. I can't imagine &quot;Pirates&quot; without Depp.But even without Depp, it's impressive. The movie is just lovable. And it isn't really because of the action (personally, I hate movies that are &quot;good&quot; because of the action and graphics - Matrix, for example), the movie is good because of the plot and the words and it's very capturing.Can't really say too much about this movie. Just go and watch it. I watched it like 5 times already and I'm definitely gonna see it a few more times. Go and watch it, you won't regret it.	5.0	Best movie of the new millenium	2004-02-04	2	1	1

I happened to see this film in German first, and even in German it's fantastic, which is saying a lot, since I hate watching dubbed movies.The previews/trailers were a bit misleading as to what kind of good-guy Depp's pirate is. Thankfully in the movie itself he's irresponsible, unreliable, backhanded ... and therefore very funny. The actors are all great, the stunts are fun, and the effects largely convincing. Despite this being a Bruckheimer Production, I was pleased that the film wasn't pretentious.The running time of over 2 hours was a bit long though, and there were some scenes that I found to being terribly boring: when two un-dead characters fight eachother despite knowing neither can win.The DVD: All the bells and whistles one comes to expect of huge blockbusters. The outtakes are fun, and some of the featurettes are also good. I don't always like watching all the extras, but with Pirates of the Caribbean you will want to see how the movie was put together.All in all an excellent DVD to own. I give the DVD 4 stars because it's also one of very few in its genre at the moment, making it all the more refreshing to add to your library.	4.0	Walking the plank and take the plunge	2004-01-02	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AXZWROI9KA7LD	Velvet Elvis	I have seen so many films,old and new, that it is hard for me to find one that is refreshing and original.  I am so often disappointed.  Being a cynic's cynic, I thought to myself, &quot;How could a Disney film--yea a film based on a Disney theme park ride--possibly be that good?&quot;  Yet I was compelled to watch it.  Unlike so many times before, I have no regrets.  Despite its source of inspiration, this was a very inspired film--very well done.  The story had a sense of originality and the acting was terrific.  Johnny Depp's character stole the show, of course.  It is funny that the editorial review says &quot;Depp gets all the good lines.&quot;  That was exactly how I described the film to friends, &quot;Johnny Depp has the best lines.&quot;  The dialogue was terrific.  This was one of the things that appealed to me most about &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo.&quot;  Depp's Character Captain Jack Sparrow was one of the strangest, most eccentric and cool characters on film in some time.  His acting--I think you would define it method acting--was over-the-top without being cheesy.  Orlando Bloom was great as the idealistic hero.  I can't help but like this actor, too.  I loved his portrayal of Legolas in LOTR.  As I mentioned before, I am usually pretty cynical about such films and half-expected another mindless blockbuster ready-made to spoon-feed to the mindless masses (Independence Day comes to mind).  This movie, however, was a fun, but still intelligently made actioner--great special effects, but not relying on them to carry the film.  I plan to add this one to my collection.  I doubt you will be disappointed.	5.0	Surprisingly good	2003-12-18	2	2	0

Johnny Depp as the charming yet unwashed Jack Sparrow was great;he really became his character and it almost makes you wish that Jack was real. Geoffrey Rush ( Captain Barbossa) was excellent, and he did a fine job being the ruthless and bloodthirsty pirate he was supposed to be. Keira Knightley ( Elizabeth) and Orlando Bloom ( Will) were SO CUTE together;their on-screen chemistry was phenomenal. Too bad they're not a real couple... he's with Kate Bosworth. Blaaaa =(.Overall the scenery and special effects looked like a lot of work was put into them...but it took me a while to figure out where the movie took place ( guess the accents threw me off). The director, Gore Verbinski, has my highest compliments. You too, Mr. Bruckheimer, I've never been a huge fan of your movies, props to you on this one.The only real problems that bothered me were the references to the Pirate's Code--what the heck?!--that was never fully explained, the corset gag that got a bit tired after a while, and in a place or two the movie dragged.The battle and fight scenes (especially the one between Will and Jack in the blacksmith shop) were very well-done without feeling too watered down. But let us remember that this is a Disney movie. I'm glad that it wasn't too violent and there was very little, if any, bad language.And what Disney movie is complete without a killer soundtrack?The music really fits the movie and compliments its goings-on. For every scene there is a great song playing in the background; it adds to the mood. The CD soundtrack disappointed me by being only 43 minutes long...but that's a whole nother review!!Conclusion: See this movie! If you haven't seen it, you've got problems! If you have, see it again...I've seen it at least 15 times and it's still not old.	4.0	Why &quot;Pirates&quot; Rocked!!!	2004-01-27	2	1	1

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A7QYHLIRZLMLQ	"viagrafalls ""Peter Schmitz"""	Har har matey! Aye, Jim me lad. Swab the decks, ya scurvy lubbers.Sorry. Got a bit carried away there. I've always been a sucker for pirate stories. Treasure Island was one of my favourite books when I was a kid, the above mentioned 'Long John Silver Impersonators vs Bournemouth Gynaecologists' is in my opinion one of the most brilliant Monty Python sketches ever, and I still think the 'Monkey Island' series from LucasArts are some of the greatest games ever made.One can imagine I was rather excited when I first saw announcements for this flick being made. More so, it starred Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. Depp has been an actor I've lately grown a greater and greater appreciation for, and Bloom was simply amazing in LOTR, so I was rather curious to see how he'd hold up.Finally. Once more a REAL pirate movie, unlike the miserably failed 'Ghost Ship'. Tough sea-hardened swashbucklers. The trailers confirmed this, and it was a definate must-see for me.The story kicks off when little Elizabeth Swan, daughter of the governor, rescues the boy Will Turner out of the sea. Around his neck she discovers a medallion that proves he's a pirate. Not wanting the boy to get hurt, she takes and hides it.Several years later, a group of cursed ghost pirates kidnap her because of the medallion, and Will Turner sets out to rescue her, along with the untrustworthy (or is he?) Captain Jack Sparrow, who almost got caught, and then almost got away.So. The movie's got everything a good pirate movie needs: A band of bad guys, some good guys, a treasure (even though 'not all treasure is silver or gold, mate'), a damsel in distress, swordfights, and explosions (Trust Jerry Bruckheimer to blow stuff up any time of the day).What blew my mind though was the humour included in the movie. From the very first moment the viewer meets Captain Jack sparrow, it's hard to not stiffle a laugh. Great little bits of dialogue, cleverly combined with visual humour. If you ever saw 'The Princess Bride', you'll know the type I mean.The CGI in the movie was allright. Nothing we haven't seen before, but still it shows a great lot of detail was put into it.The cast was excellent, though it seems as if particularly Depp and Bloom were typecast for their earlier performances in 'Fear and Loathing Las Vegas', and 'Lord of the Rings' respectively. However, they managed to give it enough of a twist to not have the viewer get the feeling he's seen it before. Geoffrey Rush plays a wonderful michievously dastard. The gorgeous Keira Knightley makes for a great damsel, and you can tell there's definatly a spark between her and Bloom. For fans of 'Allo, 'Allo, pay close attention, and you might recognise the harbourmaster as 'Leftenant Gruber'!All in all, this movie's got something for everyone. There's fights, there's pirates, there's explosions, there's action, humour, the occassional backstab, and a gorgeous woman.Go see :)	5.0	Long John Silver Impersonators	2003-09-12	4	4	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A38TC59GM2WW1X	"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts"""	"Okay, this review is going to make me extremely unpopular, but some dissenting opinion of this film is required, I feel.  Back when ""Pirates"" was in theatres, the trailors gave me no compulsion to watch the film.  However, so many of my (female) friends insisted that this was the greatest movie ever.  So eventually I went to see it, and was quite disappointed.If one looks at other movies I've reviewed for amazon, you would see that I'm generally a very generous and easy-to-please moviewatcher.  However, I was not overly impressed by ""Pirates"".  The movie was not terrible; I had an ""okay"" time watching it.  However, I really didn't see what set it apart from the next piece of action-packed, cheesy special effect-ridden Hollywood fluff like ""Hulk"" or ""Daredevil"".  I left the theatre thinking, ""that was it?  What was so great about it?""  Some girl is going to bash me on the head and yell, ""Johnny Depp, you fool!""  True, I admit that Depp's performance was mildly amusing at times, but oscar-worth stuff it ain't.  I find it to be around the same calibre as something from Jack Black, but no one is nominating Jack for an oscar.The plot of the movie was...absurd at best.  The special effects weren't anything groundbreaking, and added with the plot, it produced a very cheesy movie, the kind you watch once and forget about.  Personally I felt that, despite the movie offically being a comedy, it took its childish and ridiculous premise way too seriously.My feeling is that this film attained its level of popularity primarily due to the ""sex appeal"" of the film, particularly for the female audience.  My female friends insist that Johnny Depp is some kind of irresistible sex machine, and the addition Orlando Bloom is just icing on the Depp cake.  However, being a heterosexual male, the antics of Depp and Bloom do dreadfully little for me.  Keira Knightly, although objectively a pretty girl, is really not my type, and furthermore did not create a distinguishing and memorable character for me.  All she seemed to do was to get kidnapped, then do some obligatory ""girl power"" fighting towards the end.  So basically, there was really just nothing for me.In the end the only character I really liked was that very honourable commodore who didn't get the girl and gracefully stepped aside to allow Bloom and Knightly's characters to be together.  That guy earns my respect.In my opinion, this film was standard Saturday-night faire, not terrible to watch, but well-described by words like ""forgettable"" and ""undistinguishing"".  And now I must hide myself as many girls will seek my death for such ""blasphemy"" against the sex-god Johnny Depp's movie."	2.0	Don't see what the hype was about.  2.5 stars	2004-01-31	13	9	4

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A24Z39OUBG69OR	"Victor M. Castillo ""malvito"""	I love this movie, and the DVD is its own treasure, with all of the extras.  So why the pain?  Because, in order to get the Lost Disc, you have to purchase the entire thing all over again, which is an unnecessary expense to the many who already have the 2-Disc Collectors Edition.  I'm not sure if the good folks at Buena Vista considered how this will result in many of the original 2-Discers ending up in a lot of Used DVD bins.  Normally, that would be fine, but the people who are going to want the 2-Discer (as opposed to the Single Disc, Just-The-Movie edition) are going to be the obsessive extras collectors who will therefore want the Lost Disc.The Lost Disc extras are great, but would it not have been at least a bit more convenient to put out the Lost Disc as a single component?	4.0	Pleasure and Pain	2004-11-03	5	4	1

Maybe men like this film for Keira Knightley.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AFE9RSMXII4B9	V. Nguyen	"It seemed to me the movie was written in two halves. The first 45 minutes I thought was cleverly written and witty. It was fast paced and the action was not that absurd. But the last half of the movie was just a complete turn around. The story was going at slow paced filled with nothing but unnecessarily long fights. The only reason I actually watched it was for Depp's performance. The ending was predictable and fizzled. It clashed the wonderful movie I saw in the first half.The plot is so-so. It starts out with the girl, Elizabeth, (Knightley), sailing to America where she meets William Turner (Bloom) when his ship is attacked by pirates. He is taken onboard and she takes his gold coin because she thinks that he was a pirate and doesn't want to see him killed. It jumps to her and she is around what 18. She is going to the Commodore where he is most likely going to propose. Capitan Jack Sparrow (Depp) comes to town on a sinking ship and is trying to steal another ship. When Elizabeth falls from a tower and he saves her. They, the British, try to hang him but he escapes. Sparrow meets Turner where they have a long fight. He is captured and goes to jail. The black pearl attacks. Elizabeth is captured. Turner, in love with Elizabeth, asks Sparrow to go and find her. He agrees. Turner frees Sparrow and they ingeniously steal a ship. The story then goes to somewhere where they find a crew. We then find out that the Black Pearl's crew is cursed and can't die or feel the pleasures of life. They stole the curse gold of the Aztecs and have to return it all and they can be freed. They think Elizabeth is the Turner they need. They try to use her blood, only a small cut from her hand, but it doesn't work. Then Turner saves her, but not before knocking Sparrow unconscious.  But then the Black Pearl run after them and........I already fear I have give out too much of the plot. I'm sure you can guess the rest.The Pros: The performances of Rush as the Captain of the Black Pearl and Deep as Captain Jack Sparrow are what really save the movie. Otherwise it would have been a disaster. Especially Deep's performance, his mixture of a suave drunk rock star pirate could not be duplicated by any other actor. It wasn't overly done like other things in the movie. The special effects are what you would imagine the magic of Disney would come up. It was well done.The Cons:  It didn't really care for Blooms or Knightley's performance. He tried to act tough and heroic and denies his pirate heritage, but instead it seemed a bit too pushed. She also tries to play the girl-powered heroine, but that seems a bit contrived. There characters were the weakest part of the movie and so was there ""love"". There was no chemistry between them at all. It was more like they were friends than lovers. The plot was tolerable. The movie would have done better if it was Deep who performance should have been elevated to star instead of co-star. Bloom could not have carried the movie like Deep. The sword fights were well choreographed but it was too long and dull. The movie would have done well if they spent more time with plot development than sword fights.Overall:  See it for a wonderful performance of Deep and Rush. Not for the plot."	4.0	I wanted to love this movie. I really did.	2004-01-10	2	1	1

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A12B2L6ZHT5SS4	Wade Winningham	This is one of the best movies I've seen all this year so far. It was made just a little bit better because it made me remember some of the scenes from the actual Disney ride, like the dog with the jail keys in his mouth with all the pirates trying to lure him over to them. A scene straight out of the ride. Johnny Depp is awesome as Captain Jack Sparrow and makes one of the most memorable entrances into a movie you're likely to have seen.The crew of the Black Pearl stole some cursed Aztec gold. It has left them without the ability to feel the ocean breeze, taste food or get drunk off rum. They kidnap Elizabeth, who they think is a key to unlock the curse and the local blacksmith, who's always been in love with her enlists the aid of Captain Jack Sparrow to rescue her.I've heard people say that the movie was a bit long, but even though it is two and a half hours, I didn't quite feel that way. A really fun movie.	5.0	Best movie of the summer	2003-08-03	1	0	1

Tell that to Disney because their ride ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has spawned one of the best film franchises ever and it all started here. ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was a hit in 2003 and to this day, I watch it all the time. It's fun, funny, action packed, and enthralling and never leaves you bored.

I miss those days. The 1st disc features the main movie. The 2nd disc features everything you could ever want. The ""Epic At Sea"" feature gives you everything you could ever want to know about the making of the movie.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	The Pirate film was quite dead. There have been many disasterous attempts to revive the genre but it took  Jerry Bruckheimer (known for his less than subtle action films) and director Gore Verbinski (The Ring) to bring the genre back to life. Luckily, they had a galant cast (Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom with Jonathan Price)and a fairly strong script to support their efforts.Depp plays Captian Jack Sparrow a rogue who is as clumsy as he is brave. He's actually quite a good swordsman and, despite a couple of miscalculated stunts, physically adept. Sparrow is in search of a new ship, crew and the gold that was stolen from him.Geoffrey Rush does a great turn as the villan of the piece as the Captain Barbossa a pirate's pirate. He's in search of a gold medalion that provides the key to his long search for salvation. Barbossa doesn't take into account Sparrow's bravery nor his noblity in helping Will Turner recover girl he loves (Keira Knightly)who has possession of the medalion.Pirates is a rollicking good time with strong visual effects and well choregraphed swordplay. My kids and I sat capitivated by the action sequences and the humor. It's an enjoyable film that could be the surprising break out film of the summer. While it is less than subtle, it's a heck of a lot of fun for the family. Be warned, though, that there is violence, a number of killings during the fight (though none really graphic)and a frightening conclusion to the film.Sail along for the ride and enjoy Pirates; it's a rare thing these days; a surprise hit that deserves its success. Oh, and yes, Depp clearly was channeling Keith Richard as Sparrow. That's part of the fun of the film as well--spotting the turn of the phrase borrowed and the mock heroic poses as Depp plays the character.	4.0	Fun popcorn movie revives Pirate films after failed attempts	2003-07-12	0	0	0

I have seen Geofrrey Rush in all his films, and he never fails to turn in a blockbuster performance, as he does this time around. Since everybody else has already critiqued the film and the acting and the plot, I will confine my comments to why I love this film:The humor is perfect. The writing is perfect. The music is perfect. The photography is perfect. The acting is superb. The directing is perfect. Um...did I say I love this film?The extras are more than normally interesting, especially the deleted scenes. I found myself agreeing almost every time that this scene or that should have been deleted.

Despite Johnny Depps attractive looks, his character as the charming Captain Jack Sparrow stole the film. Orlando Bloom's romantic character as a blacksmith stole my heart as well as Miss Elizabeth Swann. I give this fantastic and thrilling film 5 stars without question and I give one hundred percent credit to all of the actors and actresses (Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Kiera Knightly) No matter if you were the main character or an extra, each person in the film added that perfect touch that Pirates needed.

""Pirates"" is truly a swashbuckling adventure, if ever the word ""swashbuckling"" applied to a movie. The cinematography is terrific; the story, while not of Pulitzer vintage, is rollicking, frolicsome, and exciting; the acting is extremely good; and the music is awesome.Johnny Depp does an amazing job as Captain Jack Sparrow. His character provides the tragicomic relief needed throughout the movie to keep this film from taking itself too seriously. But he is also at times pithy or even philosophical. Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa is the main villain, but a likable, logical one. Keira Knightley is a charming young Elizabeth Swann who challenges some of her father's perspectives and demonstrates quite a bit of spunk. Orlando Bloom does an excellent job as young Will Turner, hopelessly in love with Elizabeth and with to-be-revealed ties with pirates. Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport offer excellent roles as Governor Swann and Commodore Norrington, respectively. Davenport, in particular, gives an ultimately touching rendition of the classical, stiff-upper-lip British gentleman.I was especially impressed by the movie's music by Hans Zimmer and Klaus Badelt. The soundtrack, available on CD, will test your sound system's bass response.This movie is a lot of fun! You may even wish to see it several times, as my whole family has. There were initial reviews complaining about the length of the movie; but I found that, at the end, I could have watched more. There has been some concern voiced by some reviewers about the scariness of the scenes of the ghostly accursed pirates under the full moon, but these vary from person to person: my 11-year old was slightly scared, but they did not phase my 8-year old.In an evening spent with this movie, Captain Jack will indeed get you joyfully high!

Pirates of the Carribean has it all: Good acting, good script, great plot, and wonderful directing. It even has the right amount of action and violence vs. character interaction and dialogue, and the perfect amount of humor (most of which is found in Johnny Depp's wonderfully acted character, Captain Jack Sparrow).At fact value, it's a typical &quot;girl gets taken, guy hooks up with unlikely ally and gets girl back&quot; film, like many we've all seen. However, taken further, it's a story about the bonds of friendship, what is moral and just vs. what is legal, birthright, revenge and not judging a book by its cover. We see in Captain Jack an unlikely hero - he seems like a typical ruthless pirate. However, as the story develops we learn that he's actually a pretty nice guy, and that's even why he lost his old ship, The Black Pearl, to begin with. Until the end, though, he keeps us guessing as to his real motives. He always seems like he's going to do anything to help himself, everyone else be damned, but in the end, he comes through and keeps to his word and helps &quot;the good guys win.&quot;	5.0	Disney is back on top.	2004-01-07	1	1	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1V2VPA84SNHO1	"""wipeoutdoll"""	Being Disney's first above-PG rated movie, I was a little worried about how it was going to be...  Disney and PG-13/R just don't mix. (And believe me, there IS a reason it's PG-13!)  So I was just going to see Orli Bloom and *fanfare* Johnny Depp.  I figured they at least would be good.  I was NOT disappointed!  Depp was particularly great as Captain Jack Sparrow - hilarious!  Bloom was good too, though not quite as great as Depp.  Geoffry Rush was also great as the villain (whose name I can't spell for the life of me...).The movie itself was also great.  It has a good, original plot, wonderful special effects, and well-choreographed fight sequences.  Some of the fights and effects might be a bit too gruesome for younger kids, but that's why it's PG-13.  Really, my only complaints are that some of the fight scenes lasted a tad too long, and the actress who played Elizabeth Swann (I can't remember her name) was a bit bland.  It's not that she did badly, she just seemed rather dull when onscreen with some of the others.  She just didn't shine quite as brightly.All in all, the movie was great, my friend and I both left the theatre with huge grins on our faces (which is somewhat normal for me, but rare for her).  We plan on seeing it again this weekend, and I highly recommend that others see it too.	5.0	Wonderful!	2003-07-11	0	0	0

Plus a running commentary of quips and asides that keep the alert listener laughing out loud.The characters are all good. There's the stuffy Commodore, all spit, polish, and rules. There's the evil pirate crew, grubby, growling, and direly in need of dentistry. We have not one but two pairs of thickwits for comic relief. We also have an Earnest Young Lad (Orlando Bloom), silently pining for The Maiden (Keira Knightley), who silently pines for The Lad, too, despite their different stations in life. Then there's the undefinable character who ties all the threads together, Jack - sorry, Captain Jack Sparrow.Of course, Depp (as Sparrow) makes his character truly memorable. He's either a mad scourge of the seven seas, or a wobbly, mascaraed clown, or maybe both. Depp brings his unique versatility to the part, but the part also contributes to the breadth of Depp's career. Sparrow is one more in Depp's incredible spectrum of characters.OK, we're not talking about anyone's epic masterpiece here. It's a summer movie, with adventure, goofiness, and people keeping their clothes on, mostly. Some days, that's just what I want.Enjoy!//wiredweird	4.0	Swashbuckling and silly	2005-07-18	0	0	0
B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A38N7SFDOB3MR3	Wisconsin Dad	I wanted to like the Pirates of the Carribean. I settled down with a pizza and a Mountain Dew, anxiously awaiting 2+ hours of great entertainment. But I am sorry to say that after one hour I wanted the movie to be over.Generally I am fairly easy going when it comes to liking a movie. If it entertains me, if it gives me a story, if the acting is at least average, then I am happy. While the acting in the Pirates of the Carribean was more than passable with Depp and Bloom adding much to the film, the story put me to sleep. I don't generally find stories to be so utterly predictable that they are dull, but for me this story moved like molasses in January. (it was slow and I knew exactly where it was headed)Also, I found myself not really caring what happens to the characters and story. My brain kept wanting to daydream, and my remote control finger was itching to hit the stop button. I didn't, hoping the story would pick up. It didn't.This is a movie many may like. For me, it just wasn't happening. Maybe it was the endless scenes with pirates transforming back and forth between humans and skeletons? For about an hour it seemed as if the only point of the film was to feature this special effect.Anywho, I recommend seeing this movie, but be prepared to be underwhelmed. Then again, you may like it.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AO70FY3RAK1QM	WMarie	"""I am interested in entertaining people, in bringing pleasure, particularly laughter, to others, rather than being concerned with 'expressing' myself with obscure creative impressions,"" stated Walt Disney.  This movie definitely does exactly what Disney wanted.  It is entertaining for people of all ages.  ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has been with Disney for many years, but it was finally made into a movie.  They hit the jackpot with Pirates of the Caribbean.  Every detail is flawless, which makes this movie the great success it is now.There is nothing like all the special effects in this movie.  With every cursed pirate, the animators had to make sure that each one was just bones in the moon light.  Having around fifty or more people to create a skeleton body for was a major task in itself.  Even the boats are magnificent because all the little details to make it look like the time setting.  The tattered Black Pearl ship was even a great task because you never see a ""dead"" ship.  All of the fight scenes were well choreographed. I never expected them to be that great.  Even the one secret cloud that the director put in one fight scene made a smile come to my face because I did not expect it.Not only were the effects great, but the characters made it so interesting.  There is the heroic boy that is in love with a lady out of his rank.  The damsel in distress is sweet and girly but she can and will fight, which makes it, feel good to know that women did fight back at the time.  And there is always the humorous hero of the story, which I never wanted his scenes to end.  By having such interesting characters already, the director had to pick the right people to play the parts and he did.  Orlando Bloom brings so much passion to every character he plays, but this one, I think, was his greatest role so far in his young career.  Bloom's performance almost convinced me that he was in love with Keira Knightley.  Knightley was an excellent damsel in distress, but her passion in the fight scenes she was in, made her a much greater distressed damsel.  Fighting back not only put her on the top of my list, but she would actually do everything, and made it funny at the same time.  How can anyone forget Johnny Depp.  He brings so much life and humor to this story that you can not believe.  His drunken walk and presence already gets you laughing from the first time he appears on the screen, but every line that Depp must say makes his character an unforgettable one.  He brings his character and everyone else's character to life and makes it all seem like it is a true story.  The whole cast was incredible and will do great in the sequel.The plot of Pirates of the Caribbean had so many twists that it keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end.  Every new twist makes the movie move faster, even if you don't want it to end.  However, by the end of the movie every little twist comes together to make a great storyline and movie.All in all, this movie was one of the greatest I have seen in a long time.  I will be sharing it with my kids when I have a family.  No one should miss an opportunity to see this excellent movie.  It is pleasing for all ages and has everything from romance to horror in the movie.  This is an old tale that has been turned into something so great.  Pirates of the Caribbean is probably one of the greatest movies of our time."	5.0	Don't miss this movie	2004-09-29	4	1	3

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A36DSCVRYRPZA1	wolverine librarian	I too have never been on the ride at Disneyland and almost didn't watch the movie because it was made by Disney! Johnny Depp is at his best! We were watching the DVD wondering what combination of characteristics Depp came up with to develop his character. Orlando Bloom whether by design or whatnot is disappointing as Will Turner his character doesn't have much more emotion than Legolas in the Lord of the Rings. Much more of this and I'm going draw the conclusion that the man can't act! Depp steals the show.As for the DVD, some people may have problems with the second DVD. There's very fine print on the back of the box that says not all features are available on all players. And the blooper reel is a bit of a disappointment. The producers did a sort of blooper montage and it seemed too short.	4.0	Ripping good fun!!	2003-12-08	4	1	3

Then... I saw the trailer, and was a little less wary.  I must say, when I saw it, I was shocked.It's a fantastic (dare I say it) thrill ride, with plenty of action, humor, and brilliant performances by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush.

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3O536E2YOKK4Y	Wuchak	"I don't go to the theater that often. A film really has to light my fire to get me to actually go out and see it. Well, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" got me interested enough to go see it when it was released in the summer of 2003. Why was I so interested? Probably because I occasionally enjoy fun adventure films in the manner of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) or ""The Mummy"" (1999). ""Black Pearl"" is a film of this ilk.WHAT WORKS: The film looks and sounds great, which includes the actors, costuming, cinematography, locations and score. Johnny Depp as pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow is a notable character; Sparrow comes off as a young Keith Richards gone Pirate. Keira Knightley is beautiful as Elizabeth Swann; and Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom & Lee Arenberg are all fabulous in their roles.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: When I first saw it in 2003 the film struck me as too long for such lightweight fare (2 hours and 23 minutes). It also struck me as boring and forgettable. I decided to see it again recently and came away feeling the same way. What makes it boring and forgettable? I don't know, it's hard to pinpoint. Maybe because it's too drawn-out; light fare like this works best at around 80-95 minutes. Maybe it's because many of the characters are unable to die because of the curse, which naturally creates a lack of suspense. Mostly it's because the story and characters, although fun, are absurd and superficial. I suppose it's too much to expect to glean some morsel of depth or truth from a film like this.CONCLUSION: ""Black Pearl"" is a fun, goofy pirate adventure; it's okay but far from great like, say, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or even the 1999 version of ""The Mummy."" It's overlong, overly light, kinda boring and ultimately forgettable. I know I'm in the minority here, but I'm not a fan and can't recommend it, except maybe to kids. But if it trips your trigger that's great.GRADE: C+"	3.0	Okay, goofy pirate adventure, but kinda boring and forgettable	2007-12-05	2	1	1

I mean common you knew that Elizabeth would be captured. It's only natural...she is the damsel in distress after all. You know that her lover will follow to save her life and you know who Elizabeth will end up with......oh but I still have hope for my boy Norrington! But I have to say the CGI was amazing and the acting was very good. At times I forgot that Depp was playing Jack because his performance was so good. Along with adventure there is comedy, action and romance.It's a great escape movie and I strongly recommend it.I'm looking forward to the sequels!	5.0	I Didn't Think it Could be This Good.........	2006-03-09	0	0	0

B00005JM5E	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AJD9EA658HCFW	zck7592	"Films with pirates have been around since the creation of Peter-Pan. When different directors portray their own version of Peter-Pan, they tend to focus on Peter-Pan and then his archrival Hook. However, this was the case until 1991, when director Steven Spielberg released ""Hook"". Instead of being Peter-Pan for Halloween, kids were dressing up as Captain Hook and pirates. This trend lasted until 2003, when Disney released ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"".""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is about a group of cursed pirates who are searching for one last piece of Gold they need in order for the curse to be broken. In Port Royal, the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) has the last piece, and is clueless to its value. She found it on an almost dead William Turner (Orlando Bloom).During a ceremony in Port Royal, Ms. Swan faints into the ocean, where Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) rescues her. While in the water, Ms. Swan had the Gold piece, which sent out a signal when it hit water to the pirates in pursuit.Later that night, the pirates find her and take her. This upsets young William Turner and he requests that he be on the expedition to rescue her. When he is turned down, William decides to ask prisoner Captain Jack Sparrow if he knows where the pearl (their ship) makes birth. Being that Sparrow used to be the Captain of ""the pearl"" he knows all of the information William needs to know, William decides to break Sparrow out with the agreement that he will lead him to ""the pearl"".What makes this film as great as it is, is the acting of Johnny Depp. He truly does do an incredible job playing the role of a pirate and single-handedly changes the way a pirate is perceived.Also, ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" is very family friendly. Teenagers, Young-Teenagers and even adults will enjoy this film, as there is action, romance and drama."	5.0	From Captain James Hook to Captain Jack Sparrow	2011-06-10	2	1	1

Parts of the movie gave the feeling of being claustrophobic and missing out on some of the action going on around the primary characters.
