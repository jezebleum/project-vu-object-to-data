Started off a little boring but kept me on the seat through out the whole movie. What I definitely liked about it, is the stroy line. It was full of information. No such thing as short plot and enough of adventures as well. Great balance I must say. 1hour and 45 minutes of great story line is what it is. Sure I'm looking forward for ''the incredibles 2''	5.0	Looking forward for ''the Incredibles 2''	2011-04-24	2	0	2

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2LNR55TM67AU4	&#34;Gimpy&#34; Peach Johnson	"Of all the Disney/Pixar films, this is by far my favorite. From the previews, I had low expectations for this film: I typically don't like ""James Bond"" type spy stories featuring a hero armed with far-fetched gadgets; in addition the whole ""superhero"" theme just didn't appeal to me. Still, I liked the other Disney/Pixar films, so I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.Ignoring other complaints that this movie ""ripped off"" several others, I'll only say that taken by itself, it works wonderfully. Despite being computer animated, the characters are completely believeable and more importantly, likeable. Too many movies have been spoiled by uninteresting characters that fail to capture the viewer's attention or emotions. The story is exciting and fast-paced, admirably blending action and humor. This film is perhaps the longest animated feature I have ever seen, yet the minutes just fly by. The animation is absolutely stunning. Some here have wondered ""why bother to animate this movie--why not shoot it in live action?"" To me, the animation is what makes it work, and what sets it apart from the James Bond movies I dislike. I find the Bond films simply too unbelieveable, his unending supply of rediculous high-tech devices and his ability to weasel out of every situation simply pushes my suspension of disbelief too far. Somehow, when the characters are animated, my suspension of disbelief is kicked up several notches and I'm able to enjoy the gadgets and narrow escapes without always sarcastically thinking to myself ""yeah, right!"" The music is very fitting, and the voices superb. Brad Bird as Edna Mode just steals the show.I'm no videophile, but I found this widescreen 2-DVD set to be just fine. The image quality looks great to me, and the sound is fantastic. I enjoyed the several ""making of"" documentaries and the added ""Jack-Jack Attack"" cartoon short as well. I normally don't spend too much time browsing around a DVD's extras, and I found plenty here to keep me entertained for a couple evenings.Overall, this is a fun, fast-paced film. I saw this twice in the theatre, then bought the DVD and have seen it several times since then. It doesn't get stale, and I'm sure I will continue to enjoy this for many years to come. Highly recommended!"	5.0	Loved it!	2005-12-09	4	3	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3N26CT3Z7WA6K	A &#34;Billy T.&#34;	Toy Story was groundbreaking.  Finding Nemo and Monster's, Inc. were heartwarming. Cars was nothing short of Amazing.  The best Pixar movie, in my opinion, was The Incredibles, particularly for adults.  The film follows the misadventures of a superhero family who is trying (or not trying, as the case may be) to live a normal life.  The storytelling is brisk, strikes the right balance between dark/light and child/adult themes, and hits on superhero themes that would be familiar to both older and younger generations.  The characters are relatable individual and as a family, and maybe more than any other of the Pixar films, would be thoroughly enjoyable by teens and adults. The &#34;Jack-Jack Attack&#34; short is a real hoot, and a very apropos special feature.I purchased the film on DVD (before HDTV and Blu-Ray) and the picture was amazing.  You can clearly see the advances in digital animation compared to earlier Pixar movies, particularly in the volcano scenes.  With upscaling and LED and all the wonderful modern technologies, it looks even more (OK, wait for it...) incredible.  At some point, I'll be purchasing the Blu-Ray version of the movie and enjoying it even more.	5.0	THE BEST PIXAR MOVIE EVER	2014-02-25	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1VQBHHXIKHIGS	A Customer	If you saw this, imagine it without the music. It'd lose a lot. We have a cartoon family of superheroes doing what superheroes do. Damn impressive cartoon technology, but so what? They're never going to be as convincing as human actors. So what do we do with this technology? Move it to the fringes where acting isn't so important, like talking animals, science fiction, fantasy, superhero stuff. TERMINATOR II was an awesome use of the technology, but what else is it good for? This movie is good if you're too exhausted to do anything constructive, like thinking, but I doubt any adult will sit through it twice.	2.0	The Incredibles	2006-08-28	21	2	19
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A15GZ75XHWR6Y4	A Customer	The Incredibles was a horrible film for young viewers. With references to suicide, infedelity, and traumatized lifes, this is not the kind of thing I would want kids to see. I have to admit the animation is extraordinary, the story is not appropriate for Disney.It's basically a story about a superhero being stripped of his super identity after saving a man who attempts suicide. As years pass, this ex-hero works at a job he hates (and beats up his boss), constantly fights with his wife, and doesn't involve himself in any of his three disturbed children's lives.I would warn any parent of this movie. It's not as wholesome as Finding Nemo. Disney/Pixar must have created a bad example for children.	1.0	TERRIBLE MOVIE FOR KIDS!!! DISTURBING & DEPRESSING	2005-05-31	73	4	69
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A18BD98SU49UB7	"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H."""	The Incredibles tells a terrific story, which follows the lives of fallen hero's always itching to get back in the action.I went in to the theatre expecting a few laughs, but also carried in a little grain of salt. It would be so easy for Pixar and Disney to take a mis-step and release a quick money grabbing kid charmer, but fortunately my mind was quickly set to ease. The action, the imagination, and the downright quirkiness of the incredibles makes it a near perfect, ambitious flick.The animators must have been going nuts through production. The details are astounding, and even with all their strength's the hero's retain a sincere, flawed humanity. Any other way, and it would have lost my vote.See the Incredibles, it's original, that in itself is a virtue.	4.0	Why should you see the Incredibles?	2004-11-10	0	0	0

Subtle little touches or blatant scenes that only the older viewers will get make this movie tolerable when playing so frequently.

I was disappointed.It looked really nice, and it had some interesting ideas and some funny moments, but the story and characters didn't grab you as much as they did in toy story,finding nemo, and Monsters Inc. The plot seemed much to much like a re-hash of the spy kids movies too. Hopefully, Pixar's next outing will be more enjoyable.	3.0	disappointing.	2004-11-30	29	5	24
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"This was an impressive film.  I have not had the best of luck with PIXAR films lately.  I didn't really see the creativity in Monsters, Inc and Finding Nemo literally gave me the sweats when I watched it, so there was some hesitancy to see what PIXAR could do to topple their past mega-hits.  Well, what they crafted was something so out of left field that even I, the movie kinda guy, never saw it coming.  They made a very witty, intelligently clever, powerfully smart adult cartoon.  While there were elements throughout the film that I felt children would enjoy, I did feel as if 92% of this film was invested with the intelligent adult in mind.  There is great respect paid to the superheroes of my father's generation as well as a specific intent to downplay the ""cute"" element and keep us glued to our seats with action, suspense, and some of the most ingenious animation to be seen this side of the Mississippi.From beginning to end, this film reeked perfection in a way that other films only aspire to smell like.  It not only gave us this huge pre-story about what was happening in the world of superheroes (a concept that seemed taboo in the past), but it also gave us this enormous family dynamic that allowed each character to be built from the floor up.  Each of our characters has their own dilemma, their own style, and their own hurdles that they need to cross, and Brad Bird gives them each their moment to shine.  While he does focus heavily on our ""head of family"" Mr. Incredible, he gives so much attention to detailing the rest of the characters and scenes that you never feel this uneven balance.  This is a story about family, about realizing that you are ""super"", and that powers are not needed to realize this.  These are huge issues to cover in a animated film, but Bird succeeds in these three ways:First, he gives the film the time that it deserves.  This is not some mere 89 minute film that never develops anything, never takes a chance, nor allows our characters to shine, but instead a very hefty 121 minutes of sheer pleasure.  This is also why I think Bird had adults in mind while creating this visual feast, I know of very few children's films that are that extensive, normally you loose the child too quickly, but perhaps Bird wasn't aiming towards that audience.  At least, that is what I witnessed.Second, Bird gives us this huge world that is not surrounded by animated boundaries.  We do not stay in just one city, we do not loiter around the superhero's house all day, and we do not get pulled into normal animated clich&eacute;s like the man saves the day and gets himself that woman he has always wanted.  The Incredibles went in a completely new, fresh, and somewhat tangent direction that gave it the power to grow before our eyes.  That is what I completely enjoyed about this film was the fact that I could not forsee the future, meaning that there were no building clich&eacute;s that gave me a direct path to the end.  I had to guess, consider all possibilities, and reason with new ones that were unfolding before me.  It was an adventure, not just a simple piece of cinema.Third, and this is huge, was the main worry that I had with this film was the possible ""baby"" moments.  I was so worried that we would find ourselves wasting time watching, listening, or gasp laughing at the ""cute"" baby factor.  I thought that this was a path that Bird was going to travel towards, and would have ultimately caused this review to be a bit more tilted.  But, this wasn't a film for a child was it?  So, Bird left out most of the scenes dealing with the child and thus forced us to see the adults dealing with very mature themes and scenarios.  This factor was huge in indicating that perhaps Bird had a separate audience in mind.Overall, this was an amazing film to watch, experience, and enjoy.  The bold use of colors complimented the sensation of the characters that carried with them similar attributes.  Brad Bird skillfully crafted this film that had every possibility of being clich&eacute;d and overbearingly geared towards children, but instead he took a higher road and gave us this film that will last the test of time due greatly in part to giving us, the adults in the world, an opportunity to indulge and enjoy the power of animated cinema.  In every attempt not to sound redundant, this film was ""incredible"".  The characters were beautiful, the story was solid, and the powerful voice acting allowed this film to rank among the top of my PIXAR favorites.  I highly recommend this film to anyone that is an avid superhero fan or simply is looking for an adventurous ride into the future of our movie business.  WOW.  That is all I can say ...

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A29YRP7D3559RT	"AJR ""cynical"""	This is my favourite Pixar title, and they really gave it the treatment it deserves in this package: two Bluray discs (movie on one, extras on the other) and two DVDs (movie on one, digital copy on the other). All four discs fit inside a regular Bluray-sized case, so it doesn't take up extra room on the shelf.This is the story of a family who actually care about one another. Their life is complicated by the fact that they all have super-powers: the father is super-strong, the mother is super-stretchy, the daughter can turn invisible and cast force-fields, and the son can run super-fast. Almost like the Fantastic Four (but with The Flash instead of The Torch). To make things even more complicated, superheroes are currently forced to live in hiding. Dad has to make a living as an insurance claims handling clerk, and he hates the job. Then one day he gets a strange communication...My favourite character is Edna, the fashion designer who makes super-hero costumes. She looks like a tribute to the famous Edith Head (winner of 8 Oscars for costume design).This is a rare adventure, suitable for children and thoroughly enjoyable for adults.	5.0	A great film gets a great Bluray	2011-05-08	2	2	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AP8JRCGYOFRKS	AK Joe	"This movie is great on many levels.A family or child can sit down and watch this movie and take something positive from it. Parents can rest easy knowing that this is not a ""new age"" cartoon that pushes the line with jokes, themes, or concepts, but instead actually harkens back to a ""simpler time."" All while keeping very fresh and relevant with questions of today.Early on when this movie first came out, there was a suggestion that it somehow was a modern day ""Atlas Shrugged"" or ""Fountainhead."" Although one can draw similarities, it is NOT a remake or adaptation. IT does however deal with many of the same concepts that Ayn Rand dealt with in her books, but it does it in a new and interesting way.Overall this movies teaches the lesson that in today's world we sometimes destroy the important things or tear down the traditions we have held dear for so long simply to quell the fears of a few detractors. Politically correctness has always stood on the ground of inclusion and safety, a way of putting ""ALL AT EASE"" but this movie shows that sometimes this can be harmful in the long run.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1LBMDHBZJGJ44	Alberto Diaz	The Incredibles is just one of the most incredible movie if you don't mind the stupid redundancy.I had good hopes for it, and after Finding Nemo, it was very hard for The Incredibles to follow a film that would ignite such expectations. But, this really was beyond me.The film is brilliant, it's a remarkable achievement, and I'm not talking about the animation or the technology, I'm talking about the extreme maturity and intelligence with which the film is narrated, as Nemo, Incredibles has above average character development, it surpases many regular films, and within the genre, it surpases Spider Man. Now, I'm probably going to get based, but Spider Man is no where near the brilliance of The Incredibles, it is an extremely entertaining film, with lot's of depth, in both story and character, the film is perfect, it fullfills all of it's aspirations and surpases them.Now, some have bashed the movie on the basis that the film takes heavy cues off Fantastic Four and Spy Kids, the answer, yes the film does have strong foundations from those two, but, neither of them on their better moments amount to what Incredibles has achieved, and besides, the whole point of the movie is that works within that genre, what GREAT genre movies do is they take a overdone and weary genre, give it a fresh, innovative and clever spin and turn it into a new level(similar to what Scorsese did with GoodFellas, don't get me wrong, I'm not comparing GoodFellas with Incredibles, I'm comparing the look towards the individual genres each films takes.)The Incredibles as all Pixar films cover all demographics, Incredibles has something for everyone, and those who don't find it funny, and find it too slow, well, Pixar never set out to do Airplane funny, and making fun of other stuff like Shrek is way too easy, Incredibles has it's share of laughs. And it's not too slow, it only takes it's time to build the characters, so that when the film takes a fast pace, it's not juts for the kicks, important things are at stake, characters are important. It's stupid to bash a film because it takes it'ts time to build it's characters, which seems a forgotten art in Hollywood this days(particularly action/adventure). The film not only is concerned on being exiting, explosive and entertaining, but that it has a logical and interesting story, with clearly defined characters.To sum up, the film to my opinion raises the bar in not just animated cinema, but cinema all together.On an extra note, the film has a superb use of music, remenisant to James Bond soundtracks, very catchy, and used with incredible skill.	5.0	The title doesn't do it justice	2004-12-20	10	8	2

Nice cloth and hair and fluids simulation, nice use of lighting, very believable animation that realy brings the character to life. The plot is very original. The incredibles borders on the edge of satire, but they balance it out by showing the human side of the super heroes, something you rarely see in comic books. Although they are incredible, they don't pretend to be omnipotent like other super heroes. The dialogue, the action, the humor, the unfolding of the story... it's all brilliantly presented.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3FR2L0OZJUNJV	Alexander Scott	"As a new father, I have given new thought to the kind of movies I watch.  I simply can't leave titles like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and BLAIR WITCH PROJECT lying around.  Even movies like THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy are too dark for little ones to watch.  And while I like the Disney Classics, I don't find them so engaging anymore.  So what to watch with my 1 year old son?THE INCREDIBLES is the perfect family movie.  It's great on two levels - kid friendly  and interesting to adults.  First, there is no inappropriate language and no sexual innuendo.  I am stunned as an adult at much these two are present in cartoons and children's shows.  I'm not against these two things, but that's not what ""G"" is for.  There's no bathroom humor and the kids are respectful of their parents (the kids still fight and misbehave but not in rebellious ways).  And while there is a lot of cartoon violence (punches, kicks, and throws), the mother warns her children ""This is not like Saturday-morning cartoons.  These people will kill you if given the chance, so don't give them that chance.""  Very sobering.  Also, Mr. Incredible finds the skeleton of a murdered superhero; that scene carries a lot of weight.All of these points may sound like a boring movie, but it just means that THE INCREDIBLES has to EARN your interest rather than rely on gags.In terms of carrying adult interest, I was amazed at how deftly the producers sidestepped standard cliches but still wove in a lot of cultural references.  For instance, what is it that blocks the use of the superheroes' powers and renders them ineffectual?  Lawsuits and the American legal system.  The ""wrongful-life"" suit was hilarious as was the villain's consciousness of the super-hero genre (""Whoa, you almost caught me monologuing there"").  Some very fresh stuff.  Also, I expected to sit through standard cliches like the good-for-nothing husband, the housewife who needs to be empowered by outside work, and the kids saving the day.  Ha!  None of these occurred - the characters had their own flaws and realistic ways of dealing with them.  Besides a setting that seemed pulled from a Marvel universe, I also enjoyed some of the elements lifted from non-superhero sources, particularly STAR WARS and the JAMES BOND franchise.  I was amused that my wife said ""This reminds me of Austin Powers""; yes, it might, if you have no idea who James Bond (!!!) is.Seriously, this is good stuff.  I cannot think of anyone too young or too old to enjoy this movie.  It relies on fresh writing and an authentic portrayal of family life.  One caveat - you ABSOLUTELY have to have had a new baby to appreciate the scene with Jack-Jack at the end.  I thought ROTFL was a figure of speech until I had to pick my wife off the floor when she saw the end.  Good stuff indeed."	5.0	Genuine Family Fare	2006-02-11	3	2	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A14N5L5T089VX3	"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader"""	"Brad Bird's ""The Incredibles"" is, I think, the best film ever produced by Pixar, and ranks tight up there with the greatest animated films ever produced or distributed by Pixar's partner, Disney.  It is a standard by which all other past, present and future animated films will be measured.Not only is it superb in terms of its technical quality, but the story it tells is rich, compelling, and interesting: a real heartwarming tale about the challenges, importance and dynamics of being in a family, wrapped up in an action packed superhero story that is - lets face it - really fun to watch!  It is a story filled with humor that children and their parents will appreciate on many different levels, with life lessons clearly being taught, but presented in a way that is not too pushy, and which the almost nonstop action is not allowed to obscure.I could go on and fill in the story's details, as many of my predecessors have done here (in other reviews), but I think all that really needs to be said is that if you're looking for a modern CGI-based animated film that the whole family will love, and which works as well as (or better than) even the greatest of the classic animated Disney films, this is it.Much of the Bonus DVD material is fun, even hilarious, and gives valuable insight into the film's storyline and themes, as well as making it clear how much care was put into its production.  Even so, I was a little bit disappointed in a couple of spots: being left with a feeling of ""isn't there more?""  It also seems that some of the bonus material was put there just to fill space, included without the care and careful consideration that went into the movie itself.One disappointment was Brad Bird's comment in one interview, where he discusses the scene where Mr. Incredible sneaks onto the grounds of Syndrome's secret Island base at night, then conks a guard with a well thrown coconut.  When first conceived, the CGI artist who did the scene initially presented it in several alternative versions.  Mr. Bird says all of the alternatives were wonderful, creative, and funny, and that he hoped they would be included as extra material when the DVD came out.  Those alternatives are missing from the bonus DVD, which leaves me a little miffed, but not enough to reconsider the 5 star rating I'm giving this DVD - since I'd give it a 5 star rating even if the bonus material were not present!All in all, a wonderful movie, with a companion DVD that, despite some minor disappointments, really helped me appreciate the film even more than I did to begin with!"	5.0	A Standard-Setter among Animated Films	2007-11-08	1	1	0

The Incredibles (2004)A clever and fast paced script & good dialoge propel this brilliantly animated feature about a family of superheros under cover posing as normal sedate suburbanites.Mom & Dad (voiced by Craig T. Nelson & Holly Hunter) have passed their superpowers on to their kids - a girl who can make herself invisible & can create force fields and a son who has super speed and is pissed that he has to keep his power a secret. As you can probably guess, the ruse eventually crumbles and the family must leap into action to save the day. This winner from Pixar is their first to deal with humanoid characters as  past efforts have been about toys, fish and avuncular monsters.	5.0	Well Done, Pixar!	2009-03-26	0	0	0

The concept, a jaded superhero working as an insurance broker, longing for the glory days, hooked me from the beginning. The movie is visually stunning as well; it's truly a testament to the animation team that this film looks so phenomenal today despite being a decade old. Overall, the movie has a tremendous amount to offer to both adults and children, and truly is a wonderful experience for the whole family.	5.0	A Decade On, Still Super	2014-05-02	0	0	0

The antics of this super hero clan can tickle youre funny bone, especially when they are trying their best to blend in with their society.  Mr Incredible's attempts to keep his hand in the game, and also his attempts to keep his actions from his wife, make for some great comic moments.  The maturing of their kids is heartwarming.  The parents try to keep their super powers under wraps, but their kids won't be held down.  The ending is about as family friendly as one can get, it looks like this bunch is in serious marital trouble.  But mom and dad pull it together, and love and the good guys win the day.

Not only is the look gorgeous (at once modern and retro), but it has one of the most emotionally complex storylines of any ""kids"" movie I've seen - dealing with mortality, family dynamics, and more. The filmmakers get a lot of mileage out of an extraordinary family having to deal with ordinary situations, and some of the dialogue to that effect is truly thought-provoking. In addition, for comic book geeks, there are some great bits poking fun at the habits of superheroes and supervillians. All in all, a brilliant, touching, and hilarious movie that most everyone can enjoy on many different levels, though it's not a film I'd recommend for very young kids."	5.0	Among my favorites, animated OR live-action.	2007-05-21	0	0	0

I don't really watch superhero movies, but after watching Finding Nemo, I though, that the animators totally rock, and I wanted to know how they have developed, so I went to watch this movie, and I am not disappointed.The story line in this movie is not at all kidy, I mean, I didn't think that it is Barney at all, and I am fifteen. The beginning of the movie gives me the feeling that they are trying to find something to do, but then when they get to the middle and to the end of it, it totally rocks.After forcing to retire, one of the greatest superhero, Mr. Incredibles is tired of trying to be normal, when he is not (he's power is strength). He's wife, Elastic Girl, one of the superhero's, helped him along to be normal, when their own childrens also have superpowers. Violet, who can be invisible and can block things. Her younger brother Dash, who can run as fast as tornado. Together, they join forces to safe their father, Mr. Incredibles, after he felled into a trap. Throughout the film, they all learned how to be theirselves and proud to be who they are.This movie is a gotta see, and so you should own it on DVD!	5.0	Best Superhero Movie!	2004-12-22	6	3	3

Another huge hit, this genre just keeps getting better and better.The script and story line were great, the action non stop and the story original enough to not be totally transparent or predictable.If you enjoyed Ice Age, Shrek, Nemo, Toy Story I & II, Monsters Inc., Lilo and Stitch, and other similar titles, you'll want this one in your library, no questions asked.These are all stories and films that are engaging enough for adults and still highly entertaining for kids.I don't feel that anything here was inappropriate for my daughter (who is nearly four) and I'd much rather have her watch this kind of film, than say, commerical television (which is one of the many reason I don't have cable in my home).  I say this because I know some parents objected to this as well as films like Nemo, because they have subject matter that is also aimed at adults.I just don't agree that this kind of film has any harm, at least not for most kids (some, obviously are special cases) and certainly would think that any not allowing the kids to see this but allowing them to watch commerical television are totally lost.But that's all just my opinion, and I digress from what I really wanted to say, and that is that is dvd is way cool and highly recommended.	5.0	Totally awesome	2005-04-05	2	1	1

But look how many folks really did love this movie -- so it must have something, right?  What I did think was very well done was the outstanding voice characterizations.  Craig Nelson, et al, did a fine job.  I especially enjoyed both the art and voice (along with the writing) re Edna Mode.  Also, I thought Syndrome was well done.  So, yes, there were many good things about this movie (fabric and hair were perfect, too).  But it wasn't the great movie I had hoped for.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	This movie can be summed up in four words: BEST ANIMATED MOVIE EVER!!!  This is the first animated film (that wasn't a sequel) to actually get me hyped in years, and fortunately, I was not only not let down, I was amazed and happy with the quality of the animation, the story, and the dialogue.The Incredibles takes place in a world where superheroes are common.  Its kind of like X-Men, where some people are born with special powers, and while some use them for good, others use them for evil.  A few of these supers (as they are called) include Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), who is endowed with superstrength, his girlfriend/wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), who can stretch her body and create a variety of shapes, and their friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), who can freeze any water in the area, including moisture in the air.  For a while, things are great for them until a bunch of lawsuits against superheroes begin to be filed by people who either did not want to be saved or who were injured while being saved.  In order to help the supers out, the government created a Superhero Relocation Program.  Lucious Best, Bob Parr, and Helen Parr (the true identities of the three aforementioned heroes) were forced to move to suburbia and live out their lives like normal citizens.15 years later, the Parrs have a daughter, Violet (Sarah Vowell), who can turn invisible and create energy barriers, and two sons.  One of them is Dash (Spencer Fox), who can travel at super speeds, and the other one is baby Jack Jack, who doesn't have any powers (they think).  The Parr family suffers from most of the traditional family problems; Dash is a bit of a troublemaker at school, while Violet is a maladjust who often feels invisible (both physically and mentally).  Bob is stuck in a crappy insurance job, and he constantly incurs the wrath of his boss (voiced by Wallace Shawn) for helping customers too much.  Bob and Helen's marriage is on the rocks because Bob wants to relive his glory days as Mr. Incredible despite the risk of lawsuits, while Helen knows that the past must be put behind them.  Things only get worse when a mysterious fellow super named Mirage (Elizabeth Pena) offers a job to Bob that requires him to become Mr. Incredible again.  Originally, the biggest problem is that Helen thinks that Bob is having an affair, but things get much worse when Mr. Incredible realizes that Mirage tricked him; he was brought out of retirement by Syndrome (Jason Lee), a man that idolized Mr. Incredible as a youth.  The young Syndrome (then calling himself Incredi-boy) always tried to tag along with Mr. Incredible, but due to a lack of powers, Mr. Incredible always dismissed him.  However, Syndrome is a mechanical genius, and he built numerous weapons to sell and use against supers.  The rest of the Parr family is forced to suit up to rescue the missing patriarch.This movie is incredibly funny.  There is no shortage of jokes, whether they are sight gags or spoken.  There were many points were the dialogue was drowned out by all the laughing going on (but I didn't see it in a theater; I saw it in a classroom/auditorium at an advance screening at my university).  A plus for older people is that many of the jokes exist on two levels, however, there were a few that I'm surprised made it into a kids movie, but I'm glad they were included as they were extremely funny (like the line about taking shots).  Also, the character of Edna Mode (the writer/director Brad Bird) just stole the show despite only being in the film for about 10-15 minutes.  Edna is a fashion designer who did a lot of work for supers back in the day, and her mansion and mannerisms are priceless.the visuals of this film are stunning.  I can remember one scene above the ocean, and the water was the most realistic that I've ever seen.This is definitely the darkest/most grown up Pixar film yet (the first to earn a PG instead of a G rating).  One of the first shots (after the hilarious interview opening) involves someone loading a sub-machine gun.  The film deals with affairs, teenage angst (Violet), jealousy, and (in)equality.This is definitely a must-see for, well just about anyone!  If you liked the previous Pixar films (and who hasn't) I guarantee you will like this.  Even if you haven't seen/liked the previous films, you should definitely give this one a try.	5.0	Absolutely Incredible	2004-10-26	12	9	3

And with a smart, funny script that dares to explore a world of superheroes who can't fit in -- but who must fit in (so there's a hint of sweet sadness to the movie, too).The look and feel are now-and-then -- modern, with a dash of retro, and everyone will find something to identify with. The soundtrack is perfect -- a jazzy, fun, cool-as-champagne pseudo-James-Bond score, to complement the fantastic voice talent. The little touches are wonderful -- the way Mr. Incredible barely fits into his tiny car, as if all his dreams are shrinking -- the way Violet just peeks out from under her curtain of hair into an uncertain world, the way Mrs. Incredible's hips are just a little wide (she's still ElastiGirl, but it's awesome that she's still a little hippy), as if to remind us that yes, even superheroes do housework.It's a great  movie, and a DVD you will want to watch more than once.  The extras are equally superb, complementing the movie action to show us what Jack-Jack did on his day at home, along with a hilarious bad-on-purpose 2D cartooon narrated by Mr. Incredible and Frozone (laugh-out-loud funny).

What I didn't like was the hedonism, which is unfortunately quite prevalent these days, in such an entertaining medium.  Very good at suckering one into the mindset without realizing they've gone there. Case in point: if the baby had not become a demon at the end to escape the misguided nemesis, I might not have had as much of a problem with the film.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1UXMT6XQFZLA1	"Anthony G Pizza ""trivialtony"""	"Its angular drawings, earth-tone shading (deep greens and crimsons) blinking editing and modicum of laughs place ""The Incredibles"" closer to Japanese anime than the gentler tone of classic Pixar/Disney fare. Moreover, few films aimed at children (especially Disney films) focus as keenly on adult relationships until the action-packed ending.But each Pixar/Disney film has used its groundbreaking, still dazzling animation to tell stories reaching back to open-eyed childhood wonder and idealism, how quickly it fades and sometimes sours. Whether Woody and Buzz's culture clash in 1995's first ""Toy Story"" film or this title family dealing with changing bodies and lives, Pixar films are often about what happens when you wistfully want your glory days back.The story tells of a crime-fighting couple, muscle and duty-bound Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) and dextrous Elastigirl (a nuanced, sexy Holly Hunter) who can balance a family as well as she can hold up a kitchen table. Changing times and even lawsuits relegate them to the Superhero protection program where they work menial jobs (including scathing satire of the insurance industry) assimilate their children (with their own ""super"" gifts) into daily school life, and yearn for the service and glory of the old days. Samuel L. Jackson is underused here as a superhero colleague, and appears early in wistful, accurate dialogue with Mr. Incredible listening wishfully to the police scanner.The film allows a middle-aged, pudgier Mr. Incredible to restore former glory by visiting a deserted, dense (and beautifully detailed) island. He  tackles a robot monster formed by Syndrome (voiced by Jason Lee), a scorned would-be sidekick turned nemesis who eventually captures him. Mr. Incredible's dual struggles with a fan and family he each rejected and disappointed in his own way make for growing internal suspense even as the film moves toward its Disney-fied bombastic conclusion. (without spoiling the ending, suffice it to say the family who flays together, stays together.)Little visual moments and asides abound in ""The Incredibles."" Elastigirl wonders if she looks fat in her skin tight costume (redesigned by Edna, a hilarious tailor/gadgetmaster voiced by  writer/director director Brad Bird). Jackson's Frotone searches for his superhero suit while arguing with his wife. Scenes where Edna explains to Mr.Incredible why his suit can have no cape are hilarious in a film with (for Pixar) few of them.Overall, ""The Incredibles"" is yet another success for a company and partnership who rewrote the rules of children's entertainment. Like the recent ""Spiderman"" films, ""The Incredibles"" finely walks between action audiences demand and the character study making the heroes intriguing, all in what remains the standard for lifelike animation and depth. Regardless of whether Pixar continues to release films under the Disney banner, you hope at least one more ""Incredible"" adventure awaits.

Disc 2 had great special features the Jack-Jack cartoon was hilarious, I liked the Boundin' cartoon as well, the bloopers weren't as funny as Toy Story's but I still thought they were funny, the deleted scenes weren't that interesting I really don't think that kids would like them because they are done in storyboard format but adults might find it interesting, the top secret files were so boring, there is also a ""Making of"" which is like a half an hour long.  All in all this was a great dvd and I am so glad that I bought it my whole family loved it.  I hope that Disney does a sequel even though they aren't with Pixar anymore.

I've watched it a number of times in the 4+ years since then, but when I watched it last night I was struck by a few things.First of all, this movie is incredibly entertaining.  The storyline is fantastic, the action and suspense smack of realism, and the characters are endearing.  The characters' voices are great, as is each person's role in the film, all the way down to the clueless babysitter.  I know that all sounds trite, but when I watched the DVD last night I found myself laughing out loud a number of different times.The animation and scene editing are masterfully done.  While Pixar has produced several top-notch films, it's possible that this is their best (so far).Imagine being a ""super"" (someone born with super powers), but being unable to use those powers because of political and social pressure, then being put in a situation where those super powers are not only called on the save others, but to save themselves!Of course there are good guys and bad guys, and an evil scientist in the mix.I encourage you to come along and enjoy the ride.

Those who think it was OK, and those who think it is brilliant. Few dislike it.My thoughts here are strong -- Brilliant, and then some.""The Incredibles"" is the beginning of a new era of superhero movies. It pokes at the genre, and it tells a fantastic story in the process. More than a parody, it has a rich pro-family flavor, folded into a drama about relationships, yet never taking itself too seriously.The PlotTake a couple with superpowers, move them into a federal protection program after superheroes are sued, give them three kids who aren't allowed to use their powers, and wait. Prod them occasionally with anxiety and restlessness to keep them in minor trouble. Soon, a powerful, intelligent enemy bent on becoming a self-made messiah will come along.Will the retired and in-hiding superheroes don the uniforms and save the day? Can they after all these years? Who is this amazing arch enemy?Does my version of the plot tell as well as it works in the movie? Probably not, because what is missing is the funny sight gags, situation humor, and spectacular animation. You also don't hear the swift one-liners, allusions to classic comic books or sarcasm about society.The movie soars farther than the average superhero movie because, like Spiderman, it looks into the reality of the kind of personal life a superhero would have. If a world with superheroes existed, what would it be like? While the X-Men movies have attempted to address this, the concept of Charles Xavier's mansion is not easy to believe. Thinking that after Mr. Incredible unretired, he would have a beer gut is believable. These superheroes are just like us, after all, only ""super.""The art and design of ""The Incredibles"" is not the usual either. Calling it art may seem too much, and I don't want to suggest that this is an animated version of the Louvre. However, ""The Incredibles"" angles beyond comic book art, and into art deco, and pop art akin to a more sophisticated, moving Andy Warhol.The messages in the movie encourage us to be ourselves, be humble, do the right thing, and, in the case of peril, be courageous.I fully recommend ""The Incredibles.""

It's the story of a family of superheroes who are forced into retirement (and a superhero protection program) when litigation makes it tough to be a superhero.  This story takes place when the family is forced out of retirement because a particularly bad guy decides to start making trouble.  The story of the Incredible children discovering their talents is a very nice one.Personally this is not my favorite Pixar film.  Though the animation still makes it appealing for little kids and tempting for parents, I thought it was a bit too violent for the youngest children.  The Incredible children are shot at and attacked and threatened repeatedly, and I REALLY didn't like it when Mrs. Incredible told her children that the bad guys ""are not like in the movies ... They WILL kill you"".  Yikes.  That said, the rest of my family adores it, it is great for the older kids and adults, and the special features are amazing, so I am giving it 5 stars anyway.Special features are on Disk Two and include:  three very good cartoons; two commentary tracks; bloopers; deleted scenes; many featurettes, including a making-of; an hysterical video journal with Sarah Vowell, who does the voice of Violet and has written several books, most recently one about presidential assassinations.Subtitles are available in English."	5.0	incredible film and special features	2005-04-06	5	2	3

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3OLP2A09TCFU9	Autumn Witch	I love superhero films and when people ask me what my favourite Fantastic Four film is I always say &#34;The Incredibles&#34; because we all know this film is &#34;really&#34; the Fantastic Four made by Pixar. Mind you I am one of the few people who actually really liked the actual real live action Fantastic Four by 20th Century Fox but that being said, even though this film is not technically the FF it is how those films should have been made.If you are old enough to remember the FF cartoons that came out in the 60's, The Incredibles is very similar to them in a few ways. They both share the usage of the high energy cool jazz that is hard to define but is about the coolest music in all of existence. Second, the actual sound effects are similar as well. Also, they both use that stylized art-deco design style. It's hard to explain but its what the 50's thought the future would be like but in an ultra-cool artsy way AND in a way we all hoped it would be but never was.Another thing that The Incredibles brings to mind is James Bond believe it not. The usage of cool gadgets, fast futuristic cars and planes and beautiful women. The mood music, especially on the Island was very James Bond-ish.But above everything else The Incredibles is a wonderful, fun film that hits all the right marks. I think that in this genre I'm not sure if there was been a better film made. As far as I am concerned its perfect.Basically due to certain political and legal reasons superheroes have had to give up being superheroes. But as you can imagine super villains have not given up the cause and for many superheroes walking away from their lives of adventure and &#34;do gooding&#34; is difficult at best. Imagine Superman being forced to covertly live the life of a used cars salesman and you might understand how hard it is on the supes.The story basically focuses on a family of supes that are trying to live a &#34;normal&#34; life but the dad/husband &#34;Mr. Incredible&#34; is having a sad time trying to give up the old days of adventure and saving lives by living as a home insurance salesman for a crooked boss but his wife is happy to &#34;play house&#34; and live normally. The conflict arises when Mr Incredible loses his job and has an opportunity to make a living (or so he thinks) as being his old superhero alter ego. he doesn't realize that a super villain is actually manipulating him and tries to eventually kill him.What I love about this is how this film addresses something way more serious than one might think. The conflict between Mr Incredible having to give up basically his whole sense of self worth and taking a very, unfulfilling, boring tedious life that does not in anyway challenge him or bring him a bit if happiness. Contrary to his wife who has had three children by this time and is deliriously happy living a life fulfilled life of motherhood and wife. One thing that I have to say (and I am a woman) I do think that it is unfair of his wife to basically force him to be somebody he hates. The problem is, is when they first got married, she was perfectly happy being married to a superhero but when they had to stop being superheroes she was even more content living the life of a home maker and mother and just assumed that her husband would feel the same with his role. This is synonymous with the conflict we see today where men are living a carefree happy life of doing whatever they do to make themselves happy but are just supposed to happily give that up when they get married and focus their whole being on being a husband and eventually a father. And we wonder why in our society there are less and less marriages every year? There needs to be a middle ground and this film actually tries to address this point which I highly respect.The film eventually tries to come to a happy ending by everyone in question compromising so that every at least gets some of what they want. Of course the actual superheroes vs the bad guys story is really fun and enticing and you will love it I promise!	5.0	"""Fantastic"" Film, Ten out of Ten."	2013-10-13	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2YWDUK0GFFPS9	A Webmaster	"On the basis of the high number of positive reviews, and the reputation of Pixar I bought this for both myself and my 3-year-old son. I was very disappointed.The Incredibles is not a kids movie. It has nowhere near the class, simplicity, humor, and sophistication of Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc. It is an adult animated movie, that deals with adult topics. As some readers have pointed out some story topics that are difficult for children such as deaths, suicide and infidelity.But those could be forgiven if the script was charming or amusing. It isn't. Instead, The Incredibles is one of the most whiny and neurotic movies I have seen.Much of the dialog is tedious explanations. The scenes go on forever with a large amount of unecessary and unfunny dialog. A lot of the words are simply too difficult for kids to understand. ""You caught me monologuing"" is but one example. Difficult to follwo accesnts don't help. And why on earth do they have a character that speaks French (with subtitles). Kids can't read that.Mr Incredible seems to shout at his wife a lot. In fact, he seems to shout at everyone a lot. I had no sympathy for him at all. Another big problem with the film is that the main character does not learn anything or really change. He is still a whiny, grumpy, super-hero at the end.The big fight sequences against the robots are repetitive. The one with the kids against the flying saucers is far too long and is just like a video game. Many scenes seem to have been taken (non-ironically) from other movies (particlarly James Bond). In fact I don't think there is any innovation in the story of this movie at all. The non-superhero characters are really ugly. The bad guy is a whiny jerk.Finally, the way the bad guy gets it in the end is really not suitable for children.And it just goes on and on. It's so long. So much talking, talking, talking. I can't see kids watching this over and over like other Pixar offerings."	1.0	Whiny, tedious, boring	2005-06-23	120	23	97

I was fortunate enough to see this movie a few weeks prior to release, actually at the Pixar studios in Emeryville CA, where I proudly live.  So I got to see it and hear it exactally as Brad Bird et al. did whilst making the final edits, and believe me it was a WOW experience.I particularly enjoyed the little references to Emeryville in the film.  Remember the opening car chase sequence on San Pablo Ave., well the map on Mr I's in-car GPS is an actual map of Emeryville where you can see the Pixar studios and even my house &#60;grin&#62;.  I guess this latest Pixar triumph really does put Emeryville on the map!  See if you can spot the other references.I can't wait for this one to come out on DVD, but until then there is always the XBoX game, which has bunches of scenes from the movie and is a very fun game indeed, if a little short.The only down side is that now we have to wait another year before Pixar's final picture with Disney &#34;Cars&#34; hits the screen.  I was also treated to a teaser reel of &#34;Cars&#34; whilst at Pixar, and I'm sure it will be just as fantastic as this movie, but maybe not as Incredable!	5.0	This movie Rocks!	2004-11-10	3	2	1

She is describing a sequence made specifically as the first teaser for ""The Incredibles"", never intended as part of the actual story. In fact, the scene would make no sense in the movie's timeline, since Mr. Incredible has already gotten into relative shape by the time he first dons his new, red, ""family"" costume. This teaser can be watched in the Publicity section of the second disc. So please disregard any claims of Disney ""duping the buyer.""And in case it needs repeating after so many positive reviews, Incredibles is among the best superhero films made and one more beautiful addition to Brad Bird's flawless animation record.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	Billy Hollis	"A rollicking good time from a movie that is well worth getting on DVD, because you'll want to watch it several times. It's tight, with no wasted scenes, and moves along an action story quickly while interjecting some of the funniest scenes in animation history.The voices are well-nigh perfect. Among Pixar's underrated strengths is the ability to get voices just right. The Incredibles family, especially Holly Hunter, all sound like someone you might have as a next door neighbor. Jason Lee as Syndrome deftly bounces back and forth between being the over-the-top Bond villian type and being the creepy guy you knew in high school that nobody wanted to be around.And, of course, there's Edna Mode - the funniest animated character to be invented in forty years. The filmmaker himself, Brad Bird, takes on that voice, and based on these results he's got a second career voicing animated characters if he decides to go that way. Edna creates superhero costumes (didn't you ever wonder where superheros get their costumes?). While discussing a new costume for one of the Incredibles, watch for Edna's insistence on ""No capes!"" along with a video litany of superheroes whose capes got tangled in propellers, snagged on rockets, or something similar that caused their demise. I always thought capes were kind of stupid for superheroes, and obviously the film's creator Brad Bird shares that assessment.Being a fan of the old Flash DC comic, I liked the son Dash. Other characters are obviously inspired by comics such as the Fantastic Four. But this movie is a send up of all those influences.The spirit of the movie is captured best in one scene, in which the villian Syndrome starts a solioquey outlining his plan for world domination exactly the way every hackneyed Bond villian has ever done, and then pulls up and says, ""I can't believe it! You got me monologging!"" This movie never takes itself too seriously, and that gives it the ability to combine action with comedy."	5.0	"""No capes!""

The animation is astounding and the script is very well written. The movie starts out with Mr Incredible saving the world and then he is sued by the people that he tried to save. This means that the Incredibles are put under witness protection act so that they can live ""normal"" lives. I love the music and it reminds me a lot of the music used for movies such as Superman, Batman and other super hero movies.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3AF8P0GINFADV	Black Barbie	'The Incredibles' is the latest blockbuster to spring forth from the Pixar Animation Studio's bulging brain of crazy and undeniably original ideas.The plot of the film centres around an unconventional 'normal' family called the Parrs and their real identities as a superhero family, the Incredibles. Sounds like your average comic-book inspired flick? Not in the slightest. The way in which the characters are humanised with feelings, humour and surprising reality is brilliant - you feel as if you are not only watching a family blessed with supernatural powers but a family with insecurities of their own such as teenage anxieties and mid-life crises. Yet, the villain of the film is the nemesis of anything 'super' so their sparrings are not only entertaining but acts of genius.It's so tempting to pick at all the great factors of the film from the characters such as the baby of the family to Edna and not forgetting Samuel L. Jackson's character, of course not ignoring the ridiculously wicked animation but then, upon seeing the feature, you'll do the same.For me the best part of the film was the undertones of adult humour and realism. 'Syndrome'/'Incrediboy' is synonymous for an ignored child, Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible, a loved up but frustrated couple with their demoted position. There are symbols and subtleties in this film that are great to notice and dissect.Review Rambling has ended.

But what makes this animated feature stand out above others is that the storyline has finally got...uh...humanized. No talking animals, no life-like inanimate objects, just ordinary family problems as seen through the eyes of a family that's anything but ordinary.They're (should I say it?) Incredible.Gone are the talking fish and donkey, replaced by superhumans with superproblems; after devastating litigious events strike the superheroes, they go into hiding with the aid of our government. But some of them just can't let go. Enter Mr. Incredible and his family (Elastigirl, his wife, and their special children). Mr Incredible listens to the police scanner, hoping that something bad will happen nearby, thus allowing him to sneak in and thwart a robbery or save victims from a burning building.Life, as an ordinary human, is killing Mr. Incredible slowly. So when an offer comes in to eliminate a menacing robot on a distant island, Mr. Incredible sneaks off to do the good deed. But it's a trap, and now his family (who've been in hiding all this time, trying to be the typical nuclear family) must ""dash"" to his rescue. The dysfunction is palpable as the brother and sister constantly quibble, Mother has to keep them separate and keep their powers under control, and Dad (Mr. Incredible) has to try and save his family from a dastardly villain.This was a truly enjoyable story for an animated film; it has characters approaching depression, while others worry about marital infidelity.

The plot is straightforward.  The superheroes of the world have been forced into anonymity and refusing to use their powers by lawsuits and a feeling of fear on the part of non-supers.  The opening lawsuit is from a man who sues Mr. Incredible for injuring him while saving him from his suicide attempt (careful with young kids here!).  The ambulance chasers see their opening and soon the supers, with the government's not-so-subtle assistance and coercion, are forced to go underground.  Mr. Incredible and a friend from the old days still save lives, but they have to do it while running from the police and hiding their identities.  Mr. Incredible finds it nearly impossible to settle into the life.  He has a family now, his wife (the former hero Elasticgirl) and their 3 kids (a superspeeder boy and an invisible girl teen and....).  The superheroes are all easily recognizable tributes to famous marvel and DC characters (Mr. Fantastic, Flash/Quicksilver, Invisible Girl, The Thing, Ice-man, etc.).  The story is a fun adventure story, but does have adult themes.  There is martial infidelity concern (nothing worse than happened on a bunch of Flintstones episodes!), the previously mentioned suicide attempt, some violence.  The most adult theme, though, is the struggling of the supers to live in the world that forces them to not use their, let's be honest, superior abilities.  In the name of fitting in, they have to conform to mediocrity.  While some reviewers have questioned Mr. Incredible's intelligence, it was he who questioned the ""graduation"" from 4th to 5th grade.  Are we really rewarding accomplishment, or just trying to find ways to make it seem so?  The underlying theme is stated explicitly: ""when everyone is special, no one is.""  The final plot of the super-villian is based on a similar theme that Rand would have loved.  All in all, a fun movie.

An adult, not just a parent, can actually sit through this movie and be entertained.  I feel the movie had more to it then other computer generated films have.  For one, people are the main characters, not animals or toys.  Second, it has a different style to the story and plot.  Granted it has your textbook happy ending, but lets face it, its a pixar film.  But, the story itself had more to it.  It wasn't just one of the characters being separated from the group and finding them.  It had more depth.  It involved struggles and hardships from hiding ones identity, twists and turns in the plot, and an actual villain.

He loves to land punches on evil robots, break through walls to save people from fires, snag suicide victims with flying leaps, stop train wrecks, and save cats from trees. He has friends who are superheroes; he shouts greetings to them as they chase helicopters, goes bowling with them after work. He is basically my dad, only with super strength.This movie is full of gem moments. Bob trying to recieve a top-secret assignment while being called by his wife to dinner. Throwing his back out during a fight. Trying to stop his kids from fighting with force-fields at the table. Ejecting an obnoxious fan-club kid from his passenger seat. We laugh because it is true-- Bob, and his family of superheroes, are human. Even the villian in this movie has quirks and character that we appreciate.Bob's central motivation is that he loves hero work. His central dilemma is that society does not allow him to do it, so he works at an insurance agency with a vacant stare. When the opportunity to relive the glory days presents itself, he dons his old costume (with protruding gut) and jumps at the chance. Through the movie, Bob cries at loss, laughs in anticipation, beams with bride, glistens with love, and grins in adventure. He is Mr. Incredible for that reason.Pixar continues its tradition of technical, artistic, and positive thematic innovation. This is its sixth straight back-to-back hit.

I'm actually surprised that kids stayed with this film long enough to enjoy the fast-paced non-stop action of its second half; the film's early scenes are a quite funny commentary on bland, middle-class suburban America and the insidiousness of mediocrity that it encourages, obviously aimed more at its adult audience than it is at the kiddy crowd.My only complaint is that Pixar animation always looks slightly creepy when applied to human characters. The actors and animators do as much as they can to infuse the characters with warmth and to make them engaging, but they can't completely get around the fact that there's a plastic, lifeless quality inherent in digital animation that doesn't exist in its hand-drawn counterpart. But that's not a huge detriment here and doesn't prevent this film from being a lot of fun.Grade: A"	4.0	Pixar Does It Again	2005-06-06	0	0	0

This movie is longer than a TV show.  You should watch it on the weekends.  I give it 5-stars.  The Incredibles is cooler than Despicable Me 2 because it doesn't have cool battles.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A6WZVL0SRQAPY	Brian Driver	"Never has a movies been more aptly named.If you've never seen THE INCREDIBLES, do so immediately. If you're thinking, ""Aah, it's just a family-friendly CGI movie...it's just anotherToy Story(which is, actually, another wonderful movie). I don't need to see a kids' film.""Well, you're wrong. Rent or even buy this movie, sight unseen...it's that good. It's James Bond mixed withMarvel's The Avengers [HD]. It's an adventure, a thriller, a comedy, and a super-hero action movie all wrapped in one. It's simply, well....incredible.Writer and director Brad Bird's second film (after the also terrificThe Iron Giant), it tells the story of a family of superheroes who - like other once-great super-powered men and women forced to hang up their capes due to legal quagmires resulting from their battles - have been living in anonymity, working in boring white collar jobs.Yet, anonymous or not, someone has been killing them off one by one, and the last hope of saving them has fallen to Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson), the former Mr. Incredible, who stumbles onto this plot when he barely escapes his own near assassination. Bob has been working without the knowledge of his wife Helen (Holly Hunter), the former Elastigirl, yet his frequent absences have made her believe he is cheating on her. Soon, however, she and their two children join up with Mr. Incredible and in no time they're united in battling the evil Syndrome, who hopes to kill them off too, making him the only superhero left on earth. (Samuel L, Jackson's here, too - as part of his secret quest to be in every major movie in Modern Cinema).What is so wonderful about this film falls into four categories:1. The story is absolutely splendid: it's everything you could hope for in any adventure movie out there: be it Bond, or Indiana Jones or whatever else you throw up against it. I can guarantee that there will come a time during your watching of this film when you'll sit back and say, ""Wow! This really IS an amazing movie!""2. It's simply beautiful to watch: the CGI is as faultless today as it was when it was released a decade ago. The graphics are terrific, full of brilliant colors and well conceived sets and amazing action scenes.3. There is an abundance of clever humor throughout; sight gags and clever puns and intelligent comic moments...as prevalent in the action scenes as they are in the quiet ones. The makers of this film pull out all the stops when it comes to making this adventure film thrill you as much as it will humor you. A lot is there for adults, too, that will sail over children's heads.  It's as hilarious as it is exciting.4. There are lots of great themes at play here: how we dumb ourselves down to please others and force ourselves to accept mediocrity to fit in with others...I'm sure girls on a date have never had to do such a thing to keep the guy's ego unbruised...or an employee with the boss, or any other appropriate situation.THE INCREDIBLES is truth in packaging...it's an incredible film from beginning to end."	5.0	One of the Best Films You'll Ever See...Animated or Not	2013-07-05	1	1	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3H2CKTFZ3B3GD	Brian Hawkinson	Pixar continually amazes me, always performing well. This, a unique superhero slant, has done just as well as the other Pixar movies, if not better. With five movies, they are five for five. The characters are fun to watch as the story unfolds, leaving watching and enjoying every minute.One huge extra that is included with the two disc set is small extra called Boundin'. The lyrics, the animation, everything, is just wonderful. As an adult I love watching it and don't mind watching it over and over again. As a child my niece loves it. And my nephew, as a 6 month year old baby, is captivated by it, even laughing out loud at times. No matter your age, I would recommend buying just for this little clip.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	Nominated for four Academy Awards, and winner of Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, The Incredibles is one of the best animated films ever produced. A cross between Toy Story, Superman, and Office Space, it provides an endless array of action sequences, visual creativity, and well-delivered humor. Director Brad Bird (who's directed a few episodes of The Simpsons) not only creates a memorable film, but also voices one of the star characters of The Incredibles, Edna Mode. And following in the rich tradition of animated classics such Bambi (1942), Beauty and the Beast (1991), and The Lion King (1994), Walt Disney Pictures teams up once again with Pixar Animation Studios (with whom it collaborated on Finding Nemo) to produce a film both children and adults will love with equal verve and passion...The Incredibles is set in the fictional cartoon township of Metroville (a hybrid of Superman's two homes, Metropolis and Smallville). Metroville is home to a number of miraculous superheroes who do everything from hunting down evil murderers to saving cats stuck in trees. Foremost among the superheroes is Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) who resembles Superman in both strength and style. Shortly after Mr. Incredible's marriage to the vivacious Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), a surge in civil lawsuits and other unwarranted torts are brought against the superheroes by the people they save, who cite numerous damages to their person as a result of being saved. The rash of legal action, and the strain it places on the local governmental budget, turns the tide of public opinion against the superheroes and forces them underground.Harbored by the government witness protection program, Mr. Incredible has assumed a new identity - that of Bob Parr, an ordinary middle-class suburbanite who works as an Insurance Claims Specialist. Cowering in his cubicle, Bob Parr must deal with the typical travails of a 9-to-5 job, a boss he hates, and regulations he feels are immoral and hurtful to the company's clients. Meanwhile, Elastigirl is now known as Helen Parr, and she's grown comfortable in her new role as a housewife rearing the couple's three suppressed-superhero children - Violet (a shy girl with the ability to turn invisible), Dash (a cocky boy with the ability to run super fast), and Jack Jack (a baby with no as-of-yet-known super powers). All goes well until Mr. Incredible, anxious to return to life of helping people, is approached by a super secret government organization hoping to enlist his aid. When it turns out to be part of an elaborate conspiracy hatched by the evil Syndrome (Jason Lee), a former Mr. Incredible sycophant turned bad, Elastigirl and the entire Parr family must risk blowing their cover in order to save Mr. Incredible, and the world, from certain doom...The Incredibles deserves a spot on anyone's list of the Top 100 films ever made. It really is that good. The musical score, composed by Michael Giacchino (know for his work on Alias), sneers at today's digital multi-track recording in favor of the old-school analog recordings of the 1960s in its effort to recreate the jazz-orchestra ambience often associated with the golden age of comic books. This attention to the form and detail of the story sets the tone for The Incredibles. And that's why the film is an absolute must-see. Its meticulous blend of sound and visuals, coupled with an utterly hilarious - if not ingenious script - makes The Incredibles a solid contender for the best film of 2004...The DVD Report	5.0	Loads of family fun; one of the best animated films in years...	2005-07-19	3	2	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2MMXY0BZF2N44	Bryan	Pixar takes a different route from their past releases for The Incredibles. They took a cliche story about a retired superhero family, and turned it into an action-packed, fun, yet original movie. It has a touching story line and has a good message to say by the end. However, The Incredibles seems to be aimed at an older audience. Children I have talked to said it was 'okay' while older people said it was great. Children may not understand much of what is going on or the dialogue. The film is also quite violent and contains many deaths. The film sports a great screenplay, score, stunning animation, and some brilliant voice acting, especially by Oscar winner Holly Hunter. I highly recommend teens to see this and for adults to take their kids.	5.0	A Highly Entertaining Ride	2004-11-21	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A17OZMMI6Q12QK	"B. Schlein ""Ben"""	"As others have mentioned, this is a welcome respite from the traditional formulaic children's films that are being churned out on a regular basis (summer and winter) like cookies from a cookie cutter. For starters the score to the film is a perfect fit and free of the annoying pop music numbers so common in films of this and similar age groups these days. The score in my opinion ranks right up there with those of Trevor Rabin (Remember the Titans and National Treasure just to name a few) and Kennedy Center Honoree John Williams. All the voice actors/actresses fit there characters personalities perfectly, especially ""E""dna Mode who is a riot as it is but is made even funnier due to the combination of her personality and physical height. Interesting fact, the voice of ""E"" is actually done by the film's director Brad Bird. Also the quality of the images in the animation, especially of thing like the hair reacting to the various movements of the characters and environments. I highly recommend this film. However,  it is my opinion that Disney is making a big mistake by cutting off their contract with Pixar after the release of Car's next year. Though they ended the deal due to there refusal to accept Pixar's contract terms, Disney will probably end up with the short end of the stick. Pixar has already commenced work on its post Disney contract films."	5.0	Now this is what an Animated Film should be.	2005-03-23	3	2	1

You have a film that supports your values of family and team-work and all things you are trying to teach your munchkins.  It is the perfect family and also is good for adults too.Some of the action may be too intense for younger kids-after all, it is a PG movie and not a G one. The violence is about what you see on the Japanese cartoons, or the Superman or Teen Titans cartoos. Some of the themes are heavy, such as Elastigirl thinking her husband is cheating on her, or the death of so many heroes that is alluded to.  There is also a skeleton of the X-Man Cyclopes in the movie.  So moms, be aware!I haven't seen such a pro-family film in a long time.  It reminds me of the old ""Lost In Pace"" TV show, and the cartoon ""The Bionic Six.""

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3N6GAJTEOF4MO	Caleb Williams	"Another Disney/Pixar collaboration that gives us a genuinely funny movie that teaches us some very important values about family life. The Incredibles are a family of ""Supers"" forced to enter into the Superhero protection program and go into hiding after a series of unfortunate events that leads to a ton of super hero's finding themselves being sued by the very people they saved.  The build-up to what becomes to core story of the film is superb as it allows Brad Bird (Writer/Director) to give us a real depiction of family life whilst adding the superhero element to the mix. The characters are something unique and The Incredibles presents a platform in which to give each unique character their own equal spotlight. Before going further into the movie I will give a quick rundown of each character to give you a good perspective of how the chemistry of the characters plays out on screen.Bob Parr/Mr Incredible: He's a man who's stuck in the past, after the initial opening of the movie we're given the view of his life in the present. He works for a faceless insurance company and although he was forced by the government to go into hiding, he can't resist but be the hero he was in the past. He and his friend Lucius Best/Frozone sit in the car listening to the police scanner to pick out crimes to solve or robberies to stop. Played by Craig T. NelsonHelen Parr/Elastigirl: She's the typical housewife who's forced to juggle an entire family of superhero's and the daily household chores. Played by Holly HunterViolet Parr: She's the typical shy teenage girl who has the ability to turn herself invisible and create forcefields using only her mind. Played by Sarah VowellDash Parr: The name says it all as Dash has the ability to be super fast. He's the typical mischievous young boy who's always getting in trouble with school using his super speed to play pranks on his teachers. Dash is also very competitive and wants nothing more but to take part in the school sporting events, because they're in hiding he simply isn't allowed to. Played by Spencer FoxLucius Best/Frozone: This is the best friend of Mr. Incredible and has been since the original super days, he's a man who has the ability to use ice as a weapon or as a way of getting around. Played by Samuel L. JacksonBuddy Pine/Syndrome: He was once Mr. Incredibles biggest fan but after an incident that left him getting handed to the police by Mr. Incredible, he developed into a mastermind inventor and the arch nemesis of Mr. Incredible and called himself Syndrome. Played by Jason LeeDuring an equally tough day in work Bob Parr ends up assaulting his boss and getting himself fired, and the government are forced to pay off the company to keep them quiet. Bob doesn't tell Helen about him being fired as he receives an envelope with a secret message offering him a chance to become a hero again. All he has to do is fly to a deserted island and destroy the most intelligent and most destructive machine ever created. After a successful first mission, Bob is given many more missions that pay very well, he tells Helen he's received a promotion at work but after becoming suspicious of Bob, Helen manages to find out that Bob had been fired a long time ago. On the Island Bob discovers there's more to his job than just destroying intelligent robots when he's attacked by Syndrome, his arch nemesis who used to be Mr. Incredibles biggest fan, Buddy.This is the typical Disney movie that endeavours to teach us something good about the average family life, with the involvement of Brad Bird it manages to do this without it being too corny. The comedy is something great too as there are parts that the adults can relate to and may, at times find themselves laughing hysterically to. There are also parts that will make the kids laugh which is something that genuinely makes this movie unique, it has a way of making all members of the family laugh in very different ways. Brilliant film and is something that should be watched by the entire family together."	5.0	An Amazing Movie That Gives An Honest Reflection Of Average Family Life.	2008-06-21	5	3	2
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1GHUN5HXMHZ89	"C. A. Luster ""The Rook"""	Fans of Pixar and Disney should love this one. Just a fun family oriented movie. The animation is great, and the story and music will keep you watching. I didn't catch this at the theater but I based my purchase on the trailers, and I am glad I did. My wife and I watched it and we loved it. I'm sure all ages will get a kick out of it. It mainly centers on the father Mr. Incredible, but has plenty of input from Elastigirl/Mrs. Incredible and their kids as well. Frozone didn't get as much action as I would have liked, but still plenty of action and a good story as usual. It seems like a cross between a James Bond movie and Spiderman, but with a whole family of superheroes.The Pixar animation is excellent. I loved the way they developed the nemesis of Mr. Incredible from his biggest fan. When Elastigirl realizes Mr. Incredible has been gone to long she suspects foul play and goes looking for him. Mrs. Incredible finds assistance in tracking him down from their funny and unusual clothing designer. Little do they know that many heroes have been destroyed by the nemesis of Mr. Incredible and he plans to send the robot that destroyed them to invade the city. Time is of the essence as they rush to save Mr. Incredible and stop the maniac that will destroy anyone that stands in his way to be the only hero.

I'd seen the commercials, read the reviews, and listened to my friends rave about how great the movie was.  So, when I actually got to watch ""The Incredibles"", I was very disappointed.  I was expecting a fast-paced, funny spoof on other super-hero movies.  What I got was a boring, dark, and violent movie that did not hold my attention.  There were a few good lines in the movie, such as the ""mediocrity"" comment and Dash's remark that when you make everyone is special, then no one is special.  But for the most part, it was not the least bit entertaining.  I really don't know why most people liked this movie so much.  It seems like critics, reviewers, and other ""movie experts"" heralded ""The Incredibles"" as witty and intelligent, and the majority of the movie-going public decided to embrace it so they would not appear doltish or unsophisticated, ala ""The Emperor's New Clothes.""

Sure, Toy Story was the first, but as an overall package (writing, character depth, plot, lack of childishness and sterotypes, etc.) Mr. Incredible blows Woody out of the universe.Congratulations to Bary Bird for having the guts to break the mold.  We are gratefully spared so many aspects that, for whatever reason, just needed to be in every previous animated film. There is no montage with a sappy song in the background when a leading character comes to grip that life isn't what he/she thought (think Buzz Light Year when he learned he was a toy, or Jessie the Cow Girl when she found out her owner didn't lover her any more).  There are no talking side-kick pets (think every Disney film ever made).  There is no celebrity doing the main theme song (Disney again).Instead there is just a great story with characters which, except for their super powers, are just like you and me. We can relate to them!  Even the bad guy Syndrome breaks the mold.  He isn't the creepy, gross, disgusting bad guy we all love to hate that is in all the Disney movies (think Jafar and Uncle Scar).  He's more of a ""revenge of the little guy"" character who just didn't quit understand, and even though he's bad, we still find ourselves liking him just a little.Our leading family of supers, at all outward appearances, is a very normal family.  Dad hates his job, mom worries about the kids, the teenage daughter is insecure, the son is a troublemaker, and as a family they are loving but also slightly dysfunctional.  The story really kicks into high gear when Syndrome arrives on the scene and the family must bond together to defeat him.The only complaint I might have is that with a running time of almost two hours it's a tad long, but that's easily overlooked as it holds your attention throughout.Good job, Pixar, and keep up the good work."	5.0	A refreshing and new kind of animated feature	2005-04-02	1	0	1

I thought the movie was cute and it was funny.  But, I didn't feel it captivated me like the other Pixar movies did.  I would never discourage anyone from seeing this movie, because the people I went with loved it.

There is some action for action lovers, a great story, and great special features! I don't think that kids would get scared when they watched it because the violence isn't bad! There is just a little bit of fighting! It doesn't matter if you get full screen or wide screen because they are both the same and it is still a great movie! It has some funny parts and some parts where you are shocked because you had no idea that that was going to happen! There are so many great things on the special features disc too! There are 2 short films, Jack-Jack Attack and Boundin'! Jack-Jack attack is about what Jack-Jack did when his family was gone and Boundin' is about a sheep and a jackolope. I give both of the short films 5 stars too! You can also look up the superhero profiles and read about them and you can hear what they have to say. You can watch an old tv show about Mr. Incredible and you can do a lot more! I give the whole special features disc 5 stars! The Incredibles is about a superhero family. One of my favorite characters in the movie was Edna Mode, who was really the voice of the director, Brad Bird. It is an incredible movie and there is something in it for everyone! I would really recommend this movie for all ages! Don't listen to the crazy people that gave it bad reviews!

While I believe Finding Nemo and even Toy Story were better than this movie, it still had some hilarious moments and great characters, namely Holly Hunter. I will say, however, that this is the most stunning computer animated movie I've ever seen. It's INCREDIBLE! Hahaha, sorry. I would have liked to have seen Samuel Jackson in more of the movie, and I think they could have made their characters a bit more quirky, honestly. Why was Finding Nemo so good? Because of a little fish named Dori. One character can make a movie (Toy Story had  a number of them that made it), and I guess to me, this movie was just lacking in any incredible characters.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1IIUCG9TJFUWS	Charles Senescall	"This movie has Ayn Rand written all over it -- the scene where Mr. Incredible lifts the sphere-shaped robot is straight off the cover of Atlas Shrugged. The Ayn Rand references strung through the film are almost too numerous to mention.When Mr. Incredible is asked to attend his son's graduation, he fumes, ""He's only going from 4th to 5th grade!"" Mr. Incredible adds, ""They're constantly finding ways to celebrate mediocrity -- while someone who is truly incredible..."" he says, ""is asked to go away and hide.""This is vintage, raw, pure Ayn Rand.The villain, ""Syndrome,"" threatens to release the technology to make everyone on Earth incredible. Because, he says, ""when everyone is incredible..."" -- Mr. Incredible then interrupts, and finishes the line: ""...then NOBODY will be."" When I saw this, I instantly thought of Rand's line from The Fountainhead, ""...don't set out to raze all shrines. Enshrine mediocrity, and the shrines are razed.""Did you notice the villain's great evil plot? His great evil plot was to release an evil robot into society, which would then start destroying the city. The villain would then step in and stop the robot, in front of the entire world, and get great approval from the masses. ""They don't want to BE great,"" Ayn Rand wrote, ""they want to be THOUGHT great. They get their self-esteem second-hand.""If you are an Ayn Rand fan, you'll see more Randian refernces throughout this film than you can perhaps count.It's a wonderful effort.And I do believe that Ms. Rand would not only have approved of this film; she could have, in fact -- with the exception of a few lines of dialogue -- written the script. If you've enjoyed The Fountainhead and/or Atlas Shrugged, you'll find great value in this wonderful little gem of a movie.Very, VERY much worthy of your time."	4.0	Incredibles Has Ayn Rand Written All Over It	2005-03-24	7	3	4

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A33IZJVCKFKDPU	Chris	"I want to know what the people at Pixar are taking?  They constantly keep releasing amazing visual and smart written movies.  Plus they keep doing movie that are themed around ideas that have never been done.  Toy Story contained talking toys in their own little world.  Monsters Inc. was about a company that hires monsters to scare children at night.  Then theres The Incredibles.  A movie about a family of retired superheros that have to save the world again, fifteen years into their retirement.  And with this entry, Pixar have made their best movie yet.The movie is about superheros, of course, that are forced into hiding when constant law suits are filed against them from people who either don't want to be saved or have suffer heavy financial loss from damaged personal property on behalf of the superheros.  So Bob Parr, a.k.a. Mr. Incredible, is forced to go work for an insurance company, working in a cubicle that is almost the same size as him (I could sense the reference to Office Space).  He is bored with his life and always thinks about the glory days when he was fighting crime and saving the day.  He goes home every night to his family: His wife Helen, Mrs. Elastic, his son Dash, who can run super fast, his daughter Violet, who can make herself invisible and can create a unbreakable force-field, and his son Jak-Jak, who is the only ""normal"" one in the family.  Occasionally Bob will sneak out with his friend Frozone (voiced brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson) to go listen to police radio to try to stop a crime.  One day Bob receives a mysterious invitation to go stop an out-of-control robot and a job offer to be a persons personal superhero.  He gets captured by his hirer, Buddy.  Buddy was the president of Mr. Incredible's fan club when he was a kid, and was always ignored by Mr. Incredible.  Now Buddy wants to be a superhero himself, Syndrome.  So Mr. Incredible's family has to send out on a rescue mission to find him and stop Buddy's evil plan.First of all, the graphics in this movie are amazing.  Pizar keeps outdoing themselves with every release.  This movie was by far their best.  The voice talents were very good and believable.  I especially like Jackson as Frozone and Craig T. Nelson's booming voice made for a good Mr. Incredible.  The storyline in this movie was a little more advanced than previous Pixar movies.  This one involved marital problems between Bob and Helen.  The kids were having problems fitting in with the other kids at school.  And of course, a villian trying to take over the world.  Also people died in this movie, which is unprecedented for Pixar.  So maybe this movie leaned a little more to the older kid demographic.Overall this movie was the best I've seen this year.  This movie may even be the best superhero movie that I have ever seen.  Everything is just beautifully meshed together to create an almost perfect movie.  It is visually stunning, voiced powerfully and very smartly written.  I guess my one word review for The Incredibles would be...well, INCREDIBLE."	5.0	The Best Movie Of The Year...So Far	2004-11-05	3	1	2
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1I03J1DD8CC19	Chris	I was disappointed that there was too little comedy and too much violence.  I bought the DVD unseen for my 6 year old and assumed that the PG rating was basically for slight violence and maybe a curse or two.  There are scenes of fiery and very violent deaths!  For example, one character is sucked to his death in an airplane turbine.  Now, I can deal with death in a family-oriented movie, but there are countless violent deaths in this movie.  Also, the baby morphs into a fiery, devil-like creature at one point and it's very disturbing-even to me.  Maybe I was wrong to assume that this movie would be basically the same as Finding Nemo or Shrek, but that's what I wanted from Disney and Pixar.  Many others are praising the movie for being different from Nemo and Shrek, but I've come to trust Disney/Pixar for family-oriented movies of that style and I'm disappointed. I didn't find it terribly entertaining myself.  I thought the villain was annoying and I wasn't impressed by the plot at all.  I gave this movie three stars because I was impressed by the computer animation and I think I may have assumed too much to give it a poor rating.  Overall, I think this movie is too violent for a family-oriented movie and not funny enough to hold my (or my daughter's) attention.	3.0	Not what I expected...	2005-03-25	12	2	10

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1O834DDK5QNKE	"Christopher Beard ""I...review...huh?"""	"I really enjoyed The Incredibles. It was a well done animated film. I must say this movie was entertaining. It was not a laugh out loud movie though. There was several points where I gave a smile or said to myself ""clever,"" but the only part where we all actually laughed out loud was a part not really meant to be heard. It's actually quite funny, when the city is being attacked there are bad guys watching on the news and drinking and one says, ""hey I've got it, each time they run we take a shot"". We barely caught that one and applauded the writers of the movie for slipping in a drinking joke in a kid's movie.I must comment, I don't know how watchable this movie is, by watchable I mean, I think it can only be watched a few times before the surprises are gone and it loses its fun, unless of course you are a kid, then this is a movie you could grow up on. This is pretty typical to most of the animated films these days, give 'em a few good watches, get all the jokes memorized, and on the shelf they sit to be watched all too sparsely. Not that they're bad, but for some reason they really lose their zeal.I could deffinitely enjoy this one a few more times before it goes away to sit, I like it a lot. I commend the writers and animators. They've done some clever things here and this movie deserves some recognition."	4.0	The Incredibles is entertaining	2005-04-14	3	1	2
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A36UOQOMFUTPH	Christopher B. Kornman	One of the most gratifying experiences in a theater is the ability to go to an early evening screening, surrounded by screaming toddlers and distracted parents, sit through an hour and a half of paint and graphics, and emerge with a good opinion of the movie.  The increasing sophistication in children's films in the past years is the continuation of a theme: an attempt to appeal not only to the children the film will entertain, but the parents for whom it is acting as a baby-sitter.The Incredibles is just such a film.  After five beautiful and hilarious films, one would expect little less from Pixar Animation Studios.  The tradition of compelling story lines, groundbreaking animation, and moments of sheer comic pleasure have been their trademark since Toy Story.And of course, The Incredibles deliver.  Gorgeous background animation precisely toned to set the mood, whether it's the Art Deco retro or the action packed comic book capers over city skylines and tropical islands, the attention to even the minutia of a backdrop flawlessly compliments the stylized characters.  Pixar knows their strengths: when it is impossible to completely and accurately animate human features, they stick with what they know.  The result is toy-like action figures with exaggerated proportions working through the perils, not only of the universe, but of their daily lives.The Incredibles, while billed as a super hero film, succeeds because it is a super family film.  The plot can be summarized as a bunch of has-been comic book cutouts getting their collective groove back.  But the point of The Incredibles is that the true super hero story is a domestic one.These themes of family, working together, and discovery of self were all a significant part of Pixar's last release, Finding Nemo.  However, Nemo suffered from frantic pacing and the over-stretching of a rather thin story.The Incredibles, on the other hand, takes time to relax from the excitement of the broad, universal quests to remind us that it is a personal movie, about people.  It works within the basic plot outline, yet from within the broader framework of saving the world, focuses on saving a domestic cause.  Mr. and Mrs. Incredibles' struggle in daily suburbia through work, marriage, and children somehow trumps the importance of being worldwide saviors.  By the climax of the movie, the audience find themselves more concerned with saving the family that is jeopardy than the world at large.By the time the final, penultimate battle between the forces of good and evil takes the screen, the conflict has already been won.  We know that the domestic troubles have been conquered and therefore the good guys must win.  No matter the danger, no matter the peril, the greatest fears have already been assuaged.With all this drama, it may be easy to suspect The Incredibles of having been shortchanged in the comedy department.  But if you think for just a moment about overweight, out of shape super heroes fighting for humanity, you will realize that Pixar can and will exploit the humor of those potentially awkward and embarrassing moments to the utmost.Ultimately, good comedy takes a common experience and twists it into something a little extraordinary, like stretching the proportions of a normal looking human into a cartoon character.  The Incredibles stretches the normalcy of everyday life into a new level, super charging it with a family of super heroes.  And at the same time, it takes the comic book hero movie down to an accessible level, making it abundantly clear that they are people too, even if they are animated.This is why the Incredibles will stand out, not only among other pseudo-children's films this year, but from even other creations of Pixar Studios.  This, the first Pixar film starring primarily human beings, has a currently unsurpassed human element to it... Incredible.	5.0	Those Incredible Men and Their Drawing Machines	2004-11-09	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2KGCK3Q4VARC8	Christopher Greffin	The Incredibles is an incredibly original story of superheroes in a world that has come to reject them. Mr. Incredible with his family are in hinding, but his inner erge to be the superhero he used to be gets the best of him. Elastagirl, his superhero wife, prefers the life of not being as super in the world. They have two kids both which have powers. Mr Incredible gets in trouble and his family is left to save him. To give anything more away would be too much. It's entertaining, unique, beautiful and very funny: everything we've come to expect from Pixar. In my opinion it's their best effort yet. In using human characters they've done a remarkable job devoping looks and personalities that fit just right. Rare for an animated feature it runs over 2 hours, and is PG for some darker material than in previous Disney-Pixar films. If you don't love this film than you just don't love movies.	5.0	The best of Pixar yet.	2006-01-24	3	2	1

I thought that the Incredibles would finally be the one movie that redeemed the stuido.  Boy was I wrong.  The film is too dark for kids, yet to childish for adults.  The plot is incredibly bad and poorly written, and there isn't even that match humor, unlike films such as Toy Story.  It's pretty much for the most part just mindless violence throughout the entire flick.  If that's what Brad Bird thinks that's what makes a good movie, then he's wrong.	1.0	Only incredible thing is how awful this film is.	2005-02-28	178	13	165

It was funny, entertaining, interesting, dramatic, etc.  I was totally shocked at the plot, and found myself totally engrossed in what was happening.  The characters were fantastic, and the good superhero/bad superhero plot was great.  While I don't have kids, I think older kids (maybe 8 and up) will enjoy this.  Just the right mix of fun, excitement, but nothing really too violent.  It's a great a family movie.

However, I do not think it matches up to the most recent Pixar blockbuster for the following:1.  A little too adult at times.  Kids get a little creeped out by some parts.2.  Pacing.  Slows down a little too much on parts then speeds along on others.3.  Long term repeat watching.  The superhero jokes just seem to get old.However, this is a lot better then most of the garbage out there, particularly with all the me-too cartoon CG movies.Worth a watch.	4.0	Very good, but not Finding Nemo	2005-11-24	4	0	4

This past weekend he finally said he wanted to see it.I must say I am really surprised by this movie, I already expected the kid to like it but I really liked it as well.  The graphics and animation in this movie were very well done; some scenes looked like the real thing particularly the water and overhead view of the forest.  Every detail was taken care of and it is obvious that a lot of work was put into this movie.  Heck even the broccoli on Dash's plate looked good enough to eat.The movie also sounded very good coming out of my out of date but pretty good home theatre system.  The sound effects were crisp and the speech was easily understood and was not drowned out at all by the sound effects.The actual plot was very good as well and the movie was very well written.  At some parts of the movie I even forget it was actually an animated kids movie.  It is certainly a movie both kids and adults should love.  Its about 2 hours long, but it is able to keep youngins entertained long enough before they get up and start running around.Highly Recommended.	5.0	Very fun and entertaining movie.	2006-08-14	7	6	1

The show opens with Mr. Incredible, Craig T. Nelson, saving the world again.  Of course, something terrible happens which leads to a ton of misfortunes.  And, Mr. Incredible is fired along with the rest of the superhero population.  Now the Incredibles return to their lives, but not for long.  Mr.  Incredible is once again called to face another terror.  His wife, aka Elastigirl, voiced Holly Hunter, knows nothing of this.  But, something happens turning it into a family outing. You can pretty much guess the rest.  But, this ordeal could not be accomplished without the help of the hilarious Edna `E' Mode, the costume designer.  Its people like her that remind us that you don't have to be the main character to be a star.  She does indeed steal the show.  This was a pretty good movie.  Pixar seems to be getting more sophisticated with each one it makes.  You have an interesting story, good plot, fun characters, not a bad show.  This deserves at least a one time showing.  If you're not doing anything you should consider seeing this one.  You won't be disappointed.	4.0	Incredible family fun!	2004-11-17	0	0	0

While the young audience will be pleased with the action sequences and sound, the story strikes a deep chord with the middle aged Moms and Dads.This is the comic version of Parenthood, Desperate Housewives, Cosby Show, Eight is Enough all mixed together. Every few minutes, real family issues come up and make The Incredibles family so genuinely human. 2 scenes particularly appealed to me - (1)Dad landed on a luscious green island to rescue the world. He wanted to flex his superhero muscles and make a sprint, only to find his body failed him.  (2)Mom and the 2 kids, nearly drowned in the sea, pulled themselves together and speeded to the island to save Dad.As entertaining as you can get, this is definitely a must-watch family movie. What's more, it is a piece of art and chicken soup for the adults. The bonus features contain alternate opening scenes, story boards and what a feat the production team had pulled off!

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"At a time where a lot of comic book movies are coming out based on actual comic books, in comes the Incredibles to show the other filmmakers how it's done. Constantine was really disappointing, Elektra was funny but not in a good way and Daredevil just didn't feel right. In comes Brad Bird, well known for the vastly underrated Iron Giant, he comes and completely thrills while still having it nice enough for the kiddies.Bob Parr was at the top of his game. He was formally known as Mr. Incredible whose special powers was incredible(ugh, I wanted to go through this review without using that word) strength. He also is married to Helen, or Elastigirl in the old days. However, in typical fashion, or probably in typical American fashion, Mr. Incredible is sued for people not wanting to be saved or from suffering injuries. So in the end, all the supers are sued and are forced into hiding, masquerading as regular people.Bob, 15 years since his glory days, is now a claims worker for an insurance company while Helen is a housewife. He finds life rather mundane since he can't relive his glory days. In comes Mirage, a woman who would like to hire him and do some superhero stuff. He agrees, not telling his wife and does some superhero work with his wife none the wiser. However, he's tricked by his employer and stranded on the employer's island. So Helen and their 2 kids, Dash and Violet have to go in and help Dad.One thing I like is that it is a kids movie with animation from a company that does kid movies but yet it's got more suspense and big action sequences then the last Spiderman. One scene, the ""100 meter Dash"" has Pixar calls it, is quite a scene to watch. Even the humor is there, while not being full of witty puns like previous films, it does have it's nice moments, like when Edna, a superhero costume maker regales Helen of the superheroes whose lives were cut short just because of a cape.The voices are quite nice. Craig T. Nelson(""Coach"")has a way to be a calm presense one scene than start going off. And Holly Hunter's probably the coolest mom on screen although her explanations of why Dash can't go into sports seems a bit TOO overprotective. And Jason Lee, largely known for his roles in the Jay and Silent Bob films actually does a good job as villain Syndrome. Definite highlight is writer/director Brad Bird doing a nice job as Edna Mode, a nice little Edith Mead echo, a big costume designer from the old era.There's one thing that I'm a little disappointed in and oddly it has nothing to do with the film. It's the extras. There's a cute little short that explains why the babysitter Kari was so frantic on the phone about baby Jack-Jack. It has really weak outtakes that just looks plain silly and nowhere near what they did for previous films. And the making of is nice but it's almost kind of superflous or surface skimming. They don't even go much into detail about the voice actors or the 100 meter dash in designing. But there is a nice feature on the Character Designs, the Extra characters, the Sets but they don't go into as much detail as you'd want them too like in the Bug's Life extras.However, it is quite a film to watch and not a typical ""I'm only watching this for the kids"" movie, you'll probably find it awesome too."	5.0	It's so easy but: this movie is quite incredible	2005-03-15	1	1	0

While those two will still have a place in my popcron-laden heart, The Incredibles have overtaken those two categories.What I love most about this movie is the way it looks and feels. The CGI is flawless, but what's striking is the James Bond/superspy feel to it (especially Moonraker). It's refreshing to see a superhero-based film not primarily set in an urban area. These two points will have you forget that you're watching a superhero movie and while some might say that it's a drawback, I welcome it. Change is a good thing.The only thing wrong with this movie that I can think of is originality of the heroes, but that's obvious considering it's a superhero movie. You'll see bits and pieces of Superman, the Flash, and so on, and but that shouldn't hinder anyone from watching it. While Brad Bird didn't set out to find new mind-bending powers the Incredibles possess, he *did* find a unique way of telling an otherwise bland story into something special.While it's more violent than Finding Nemo and a little less complex than The Iron Giant, it's still a great movie. The Incredibles improves upon those movies' flaws and comes out soaring.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3FZMYI7RA7E3P	"C. Price ""Layman, Lawyer, Blogger"""	A good, but not great, DVD.  I had not seen The Incredibles in the theater so the DVD provided me with my first opportunity to review the movie.  The animation is well done, but the story drags at the beginning.  Seeing how out-of-work former super heroes cope with drab menial lives is not particularly compelling cinema.  It is necessary for setting up the story, but took too much time.Once the super villain's plan begins to unfold, then the movie finds its legs.  The action scenes are well done, the interaction of the family is humorous and even touching, and the rest of the characters entertaining.  If the first half of the film was as entertaining as the second half, I would have given this flick five stars.Among the extras, Jack-Jack Attack truly stands out.  It cleverly fills in a sequence in the movie in one of the funniest extras I have ever seen in a DVD.  Most of the rest of the extras I did not find entertaining.  There are some extra videos about the super heroes, but they were obviously not done with the same animation as the movie itself and Jack-Jack Attack.  But even setting the animation quality aside, they simply are not that funny.	3.0	Slow Start, Strong Finish, Hit or Miss Extras	2005-04-09	8	2	6

Most of the attention was on a competing animated film but this is the one that turned out to be a huge box-office success. Word of mouth helped his immensely. It's what made me check it out, as several friends recommended it. I wound up agreeing with them: it's excellent entertainment.From that point, I began checking out almost every new animated film and have usually been pleased. Animated movies have been astounding the past four years and especially now with Blu-Ray.As impressive as the visuals and sound are,  it's the story that carries this film: a solid combination of humor, drama, suspense, family ties and action.As an adult, it's not always easy to keep my attention for two hours with animation but the fact this movie does, tells you how good the story is presented.....but watching this on Blu-Ray will blow you away!

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"""The Incredibles"" is more than a fabulous animated film, it is simply a Great Movie.  It has wonderfully rich characters.  It is easy to like Bob & Helen Parr and their children Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack.  They are fun as Super Heroes with their own foibles, but seeing them try to live normal lives in the Super Hero Relocation Program is also very funny.  The parents have the normal problems of raising kids and the kids are largely normal with the usual age appropriate complaints.Bob (Mr. Incredible) and his best buddy Lucius Best (Frozone) try and get their kicks as best they can while maintaining their relocated cover.  Of course, something goes wrong and leads to a whole series of troubles that in turn leads to the fantastic confrontation and climax of the story.  The way the family gets drawn into the fray is also quite entertaining and is often full of wit and generous touches of humor.The story also lavishes attention on the wonderful Edna E. Mode who is the fashion designer of super hero costumes.  This character is voiced by Brad Bird, the director and the realization of this character in voice and animation could hardly be better.The whole cast is great.  Craig T. Nelson brings strength, energy, and still gets us to feel real sympathy for Mr. Incredible as Bob.  Holly Hunter is great as Helen Parr / Elastigirl.  It would be boring to go through each member of the cast, but I found each of them to be superb.The animation is also terrific.  Look at all the details including the finger marks in Bob's ridiculous car when he comes home from work and slips on Dash's skateboard.  The movie is full of great images both big and small.  You can pick out wonderful new things during repeated viewings.There is a whole disk of wonderful extras.  You won't want to miss the spectacular ""Jack Jack Attack"".  This is the realization of that magnificent series of voice messages Helen listens to in the limo on the way home to set up the film's denouement.  I agree that it didn't need to be in the movie, but it is a wonderful experience all on its own.Strongly Recommended.

The Incredibles is destined to become yet another Pixar classic that gets played again and again, years into the future.As the dad of my family, I appreciated The Incredibles focus on the male psyche and the pressures that modern-day dads endure.  There is more than a little bit of Mr. Incredible in all dads these days, even if we can't lift our commuter cars over our heads.  However, I also saw a lot of my wife in the character of Elastigirl, as did she (by the way, Holly Hunter does a great voiceover for Elastigirl).  Almost all kids will instantly identify with Dash, the young boy, and they will be filled with joy as Dash finally gets to use his powers to help save the day.  The only weak, unappealing main character is Invisigirl, who I felt was too much of a low self-esteem, angst-ridden, shy teenage girl.The storyline of The Incredibles is remarkably grown-up, and even has bearing on aspects of our politics and culture.  The main message is a valid one: don't accept mediocrity.  However, this means that certain aspects of the film are politically incorrect (egads, we're not all equal - and that's OK!), which is refreshing to see in a mainstream Hollywood film.  Yet the film is not preachy, and there is more than enough other material to keep even a 4 year-old riveted to her seat.The PG-rating comes from the cartoon-like violence.  If your kids have been previously exposed to this type of action, then there is nothing to fear from The Incredibles.  My whole family truly enjoyed the film, and can't wait for the next Pixar release.	5.0	Incredible fun for the whole family!	2005-01-11	2	1	1

The sound will blow you away, as the oscar for sound editing won will attest. The special features are great, my favorite being the new short feature 'Jack-Jack Attack"". This short fills in the gap made by leaving the baby with a sitter while fighting evil. Hilarious! Actually, watch the short first then the movie, you'll crack up!

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A21B2TJBWCSK1R	Cubist	"The Incredibles marks the first effort from the collaboration between Brad Bird (responsible for The Iron Giant) and Pixar. Where Warner Brothers had no idea how to market Bird's first film, Disney had no problem with promoting his new movie and it was a huge hit. The Incredibles is also the first Pixar film with human beings as the central characters, instead of relegated to the margins. Perhaps they were waiting for computer animation to progress enough to render them convincingly or maybe they were waiting for someone with the right vision to realize them. They found it with Bird who uses his cartoonish style of caricature to exaggerate a character's physical features and body gestures to make them more identifiable to the audience.As is typical with previous Pixar DVDs, The Incredibles is jam-packed with a wealth of extra material. All of the animated menus keep in flavour and tone with the look and feel of the movie, which is a really nice touch.The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Brad Bird and producer John Walker. The two men constantly praise their hard-working crew for achieving the look and feel that they strove to achieve. Bird touches upon some of the film's themes and plot points in this engaging and informative track.There is a second commentary track by several of the film's animators. They talk about some of the techniques used in the movie. The strengths of caricature vs. realistic art are discussed and it is pointed out that caricature brings out the essence of a character.The second disc starts off with ""Jack-Jack Attack,"" an animated short film created specifically for the DVD that stars the Parr's baby. It shows us what happened between Jack-Jack and the babysitter while the Incredibles were off saving the world.There are six deleted scenes in various unfinished forms (often animated storyboards) that are individually introduced by Bird who puts each one into context and explains why it was cut. He does an excellent job talking about each scene.The ""Behind the Scenes"" section includes a detailed Making of Featurette (and a collection of additional footage) that shows how much time, energy and hard work went into making The Incredibles. This featurette covers all aspects, from story to character design to music and even the customary blooper reel.""Top Secret"" features a ""vintage"" Mr. Incredible cartoon that is a spot-on parody of crudely animated cartoons from the `60s. Craig T. Nelson and Samuel L. Jackson even reprise their roles in a mock audio commentary trashing the cartoon! There are also beautifully designed profiles of all the costumed characters from the movie, even minor ones that are only briefly mentioned.""Boundin'"" is the animated short film that appeared in front of The Incredibles when it debuted in theatres.The Incredibles continues Pixar's unprecedented streak of box office and critical successes. With each film they have further advanced the art of computer animation and this film is no different. However, Bird brings his own unique vision that separates his movie from the rest of Pixar's canon. It is a refreshing new perspective that features Bird's obsession with the `50s and superheroes. The Incredibles is a near perfect blend of populist sensibilities with an engaging and entertaining story that never condescends to children or alienates adults. Like other Pixar films it will endure because it appeals to people of all ages."	5.0	It Just Doesn't Get Any Better Than This!	2005-03-16	8	5	3

The animation compares toToy Story, but nowhere as good as Ice age. In Ice age the characters seem to come off te screen into my living room.Unlike Sherk which is clearly a fairy tale, this movies characters live in a real world of insecurities about body image, and unemployment,with children that unexpectedly have adventure forced upon them.The lone Black hero finds it necesary to use language which isnot appropriate for adults to use, not to mention children under 16 to hear.	3.0	Good but not incredible.	2005-07-23	9	2	7

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A25W5Q2RSMB841	C. Wood	"This film contains action sequences that are jaw-dropping in scope, creative in execution, and as thrilling as they are beautiful. The characters are wonderful, the animation is superb, and the story is both exciting and funny. This film is a masterpiece. Toy Story and it's sequel are excellent films and I thought that there was no way Pixar could possibly continue creating that level of greatness. While A Bugs Life wasn't one of my favorites, it's still a fantastic film. Monsters Inc. continued the Pixar tradition of making a better movie. The ending line in that film is one of my favorite closing moments in cinema. It's simple, heartfelt, and provides a beautiful impression that their world will continue in a positive direction despite the end of the movie(something that kids, the target audience, need to know). Finding Nemo, like all other Pixar films, has a strong family message and it provides us with some beautiful visuals. Again, Pixar built upon it's own accomplishments and provided us with a film that will be heralded as a classic and loved by future generations. As impressed as I am with all of the other Pixar films, and as much as I love them, The Incredibles is better.I know, I know. You're thinking ""how could it POSSIBLY be better?"" Well, the story and characters have always been, in my opinion, the heart of a Pixar film. Sure, everything looks amazing and beautiful, but when the audience connects with a character things become more interesting and compelling for the audience. The Incredibles is a real drama. The characters express more realistic emotions than you might expect from a ""cartoon"". The parents and the kids have troubles and concerns that affect their lives and each other. The marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Incredible (aka Mr. and Mrs. Parr) has it's ups and downs. Their lives aren't the way they wanted them to be. Mr. Incredible hates his job. Mrs. Incredible, who is a stay at home mom, is struggling with the kids and her desire to live a normal life and keep the family strong despite their incredible past. Although they argue from time to time, and they struggle with their frustrations, they never give up. They always work to communicate with each other and with the kids. At one point the kids catch them having a very heated argument and they pause, calm themselves, and then take the time to reassure the children. They explain that their argument isn't a good way to express their frustrations, and that they love their children and each other. The kids have their troubles too. Dash, the oldest son, is frustrated that he can't use his abilities to his own advantage (he can run extremely fast). He doesn't understand why they need to hide their powers, and in addition to being fascinated with his own super-powers, he's a bit of a troublemaker and a showoff. There's a moment where his mother speaks that truth to him in love, and expresses those exact thoughts. She says it in a way that is honest and firm, but loving. The daughter, Violet, can generate forcefields that can deflect bullets or redirect light and make herself invisible. But she's having typical relationship issues that teenagers experience as they explore the minefield of social interaction. She's also a cynical, somewhat depressed person who is frustrated with the constant relocation that the family must endure to remain hidden. She's shy and insecure, which make her super-powers even more of a liability. There's a baby in the family too, but he spends almost all of the film with a babysitter. Sure, all of them have amazing abilities, but they're still people and they still have their own flaws. But they communicate with each other. They honestly express their heart in a loving way for the purpose of strengthening their family. They tackle problems together, which becomes their greatest strength when confronted with a murderous super-powered opponent consumed with envy, jealousy, and selfishness. His character is a stark contrast to the noble and loving Incredible family. The Incredibles face atypical situations that present typical family problems. But, they work together to overcome them. They are a family that faces obstacles TOGETHER! It's a beautiful thing. It presents a strong family message about love, forgiveness, self-sacrifice, devotion, honesty, compassion, and personal restraint. The story is wonderful and, as in the other Pixar films, is one of the superior elements of the movie.The visuals are amazing! The film is beautiful to behold from the expert handling of light, color, shape, and contour, to the excellent retro-designs sprinkled throughout the world of The Incredibles. I am familiar with the world of 3D modeling and design, and I have always had a clear understanding of how things were done, but there are visuals in this film that go beyond what I knew software was capable of doing. This film is an amazing visual treat because of the astonishing talent driving the technological miracles that Pixar has invented to do what they do. While they sometimes modify existing technologies they also frequently invent their own technologies as they explore new ground in visual storytelling and motion graphics. It's not just about making things look as real as possible; it's more like a new digital impressionism. The same intent that drove Monet to explore colors, shapes, textures, patterns, techniques, and concepts that he didn't see, but only ""felt"" about a scene, is being felt by the artists and designers at Pixar. This is the new impressionism. It looks real enough to touch, but reality can't look or behave that way. Everything they show us is designed to provide the audience with a certain feeling about a location and series of events. They control every aspect of the visual on the screen for the purpose of controlling the impression we take away from every set, every character, and every situation. It's impressionism in motion, and it's beautiful to look at.This film succeeds and excels on many levels and it is difficult to express any problem with this movie, however there is one thing that I think parents of small kids need to know about this movie: it is a little more violent that you may expect. This film is rated PG for good reason. It is NOT a G-rated movie, so don't take your kids expecting it to BE a G-rated movie. In this movie people die. None of the death is really shown, and there's no blood, but I was a little surprised at the number of henchmen that are killed off. Also, I referred to the villain as murderous, and there is a reason. He is a murderer and takes delight in holding that kind of power over other people. The message is never confused and you never cheer for the bad guy. They even create a well orchestrated moment where another one of the bad guys comments on how wrong the villain really is. Even still, this dark conflict and the intense emotional impact of death, murder, and hatred for others might be a bit much for smaller children to understand. It's great drama for adults and adolescents, but the littlest of tikes may have trouble with the intense action sequences and powerful dramatic undertones. Of course, I don't really count these as flaws or faults in the film. This film is made for the middle crowd, not the little crowd. So, take your family to see this movie. It's a clean, fun, exciting, thrilling, encouraging way to spend two hours with your family."	5.0	Solid Family Entertainment and beautiful to behold	2005-02-06	14	10	4

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1H18YSQPT8RRB	Daisy	This movie was great, especially the animation.  In an early interview, the producers at Pixar talked about how they avoided making humans as much as possible because of all the painstaking details.  As their first movie that is actually about people rather than animals, monsters, etc, I think they pulled off the human animation perfectly.  Try comparing Mr. Incredible to the baby in the short film, Tin Toy, and you'll see the vast improvement.Besides the animation, the movie was great all-around.  One minute, you'll be crying because you're laughing so hard and the next, you'll be at the edge of your seat in suspense.In other viewer reviews, they complain about the PG rating.  Some think it should be PG-13 instead.  This doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  First of all, this is an action movie.  It's a give-in that in an action movie, there will be, what else...Action!  Action calls for some scary situations.  If you're worried about the rating, watch it yourself before letting your kids watch it.  I'm sure there's nothing in the movie that your child hasn't seen first-hand or heard about before.	5.0	Awesome!!!	2005-07-30	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	I have to admit that I was siked about seeing this movie.  My wife and I took her 4 year old nephew to see this film and I think that we liked it more than he did.  This is so much more than a cartoon, I mean, it was dang near close to being the best film of 2004.  What I love so much about this movie is that it's more about family and charactor development than it is about superheros.  It's about raising your children and coping with job issues and dealing with marriage and they neailed it PERFECTLY!  Then again, the superhero thing is a pretty cool bonus.  So our movie is about a superhero family forced into retirment because the world has decided they don't NEED to be saved nor do they WANT to be.  Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible)is bored out of his mind, overweight and finds himself listening to police scanners with his buddy Lucius (Frozone) so he can relive the glory days by saving people on the DL.  In the 15 year stretch since heros have been in remission Bob and his wife Helen (Elastigirl) have had 3 children, Violet (she has invisable powers) Dashell (AKA Dash who is really fast) and Jack-Jack who has 'NO' powers.  So Bob gets a message that theres this government robot that escaped and has threatened to destroy this top secret government facility.  Well, he has to do something, but he can't tell his wife so he fakes a work conference to become a hero again.  Well, in the process of doing so he jeopordizes his families wellbeing at the hands of an evil, and very excentric super-villian named Syndrome (formerly Incrediboy)...this is were the real fun begins and the movie turns into an action epic that rivals SpiderMan.  Together, with his super family including his kids, The Incredibles save the day.  All I have to say is just wait until the last few frames of the movie...Jack-Jack RULES...This is a great family film, good for the kids and adults alike.  I'm not a father yet, but I can't wait until I am and can watch this movie with my kids...you know, watch something I enjoy too!	5.0	Best Cartoon Ever!	2005-07-07	2	0	2

It is a film that combines just the right mixture of action, suspense, drama, and comedy.  The animation is fantastic!  The characters are plausible and interesting.  I'd give this film six stars if that was an option.Holly Hunter plays Helen Parr, former Elastigirl, and she does a great job!  Her character made the movie so entertaining that I couldn't imagine the finished product without her.  Hunter manages to use her voice to stir emotions from the audience better than any other animated movie I have ever seen.  Kudos to Hunter for such an amazing performance!Craig T. Nelson plays Bob Parr, Mr. Incredible, and he does a great job too, though I don't think he was as good as Hunter.  He did manage to always seem like the ever struggling ""wanna-be-normal-and-super-hero-at-the-same-time-guy"" we've all seen before.  Nelson and Hunter worked well together on screen (voices that is).Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee are great voices and parts in this film also.  Their characters are fun to watch, especially bad guy ""Syndrome"" (Jason Lee).This is a movie that has just about everything: great script, great animation and editing, awesome cast, and even a great soundtrack!The Incredibles is a movie that should be in everyone's DVD collection.

The Incredibles is a movie for everyone, both old and young.  It's funny, fast paced and has great voice overs.  As always the eye-candy steals the show with amazing imagery and graphics.  The story itself is solid and well developed.  There is very little about this movie that you can attack.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3RCGRXYBRKSRC	"Danielle Greenhouse ""Author of What They Left..."	"I saw this movie at the theaters probably a week before it came out on DVD.  To tell you the truth, I only went to see it because I thought my daughter would like it.  I wasn't super impressed by the trailers, and thought the movie would be mediocre at best.  Wow!  Was I surprised!  The movie was excellent.  Not only was the computer graphics jaw droppingly amazing, but unlike many computer animated movies, it had a plot--and a very original one at that!  I left the movie feeling like the fifteen dollars for three tickets had been very well spent.Though the characters look cartoonish (though they were supposed to in this movie) the background scenery looks 99.9 percent real.  I also liked all the characters, though Violet was my personal favorite.  They all had multi-faceted personalities, and were all sympathetic in their own way, even goofy Syndrome (the villian).  There was a lot of humor, the funniest character being the eccentric designer to the superheroes, Edna Mode.  Of course, the story--of superheroes living 'underground' because of excess lawsuits and how they try to regain their superhero status again while also having a family life-- was one of a kind, and very sophisticated for a children's movie, though I think most kids would get the gist of it.  I don't think I've ever seen a superhero movie like this, though actually I've thought of it many times (as in, ""You know, if this guy--Superman, Batman, Whoever Man--did this in real life, he'd have the pants sued off him for property damage and emotional distress."")I don't own the DVD but my parents do, and they also absolutely adored the movie and love the extras.  Though they only showed ""Boundin'""--the tale of a sheep who gets sheered bald once a year and how he learns to deal with that--in the theaters, the DVD has ""Jack-Jack Attack"", what happened during the time baby Jack-Jack was left with Violet's friend Kari.  I saw ""Jack-Jack Attack"" on the DVD, and didn't think it was as funny as the ads claimed it was, I still enjoyed it.  ""Boundin'"" is very cute and kind of funny too.Overall, I would highly recommend the movie ""The Incredibles"".  It's one of the few animated movies that both kids and adults can watch and highly enjoy."	5.0	Simply Incredible	2005-04-21	2	2	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2MW0RYIXMEYGS	Dave	"As I write mere hours after seeing the movie, I'm still trying to discern what's missing. Don't get me wrong -- the movie truly is Incredible. (An adjective you're bound to see again and again as more reviews pile in) But it's also of a different cloth than we're used to from Pixar. Picky viewers/parents are the first to notice, this is Pixar's first PG movie, and with good reason. There's some far darker concepts talked about in the movie. But first things first.PLOT: Bob Parr is the alter ego of Mr. Incredible, superhero extraordinaire. The movie opens with Mr. Incredible in action, saving the world. He also (eventually) marries Elastigirl. Flash forward a dozen years or so. The Supers have been driven underground by incessant lawsuits. Mr. Incredible must now deal with everyday frustrations of daily life, but also those caused by suppressing his true identity, missing his days of superhero action, and a cranky boss. His children Dash (super-fast) and Violet (disappearing, and invincible force fields) also struggle with hiding their abilities. All this changes when an anonymous source calls Mr. Incredible back into action. Even though Bob was fired for lobbing his boss through several cubicle walls, he lies to his family and quietly returns to being a superhero. Things quickly bloom further out of control than even Mr. I can handle, and his family must try and save the day from the dastardly plans of the evil Syndrome.GOOD: A completely awesome plot, to begin with. Mixing Superman with Family Ties (essentially) is a stroke of genius; brilliant, but typical of the creative talent Pixar has conditioned us for. Bob is nothing short Incredible, and a great family man. He uses his powers for good, and works with the police. He eventually owns up to his mistakes and apologizes. The family is close-knit and admirable for their devotion to their cause, and each other. They work together as a team, and all use their powers to save the world. Obviously clear themes of good and evil, which are always a plus. My favorite remark (not to get too preachy) is when Mirage says ""Valuing life is not weakness. And NOT valuing life isn't being strong."" (Or something very similar) Great action, great music, great characters.BAD: As I said, this is simply a different stroke from Pixar than we're used to. Parents with easily-frightened kids (as my little brother with that mega-scary monster fish in Finding Nemo) should probably preview the movie first, because there are darker elements in the film. Some superheroes are shown meeting their ends in a semi-comical form (the perky costume designer Edna Mode explaining why capes are no longer ""in""), but still a little eyebrow-raising in a Pixar film. One is shown being sucked into a jet engine, which is a fate that is repeated later on. Bad guys are beat up and implied killed in various ways. Mr. Incredible pitches a rock at one villain, knocking him out and causing him to fall a great distance. Mr. I does battle with a huge Omnidroid, which is like a mechanical balrog, and batters him around a little. At one point, Helen Incredible suspects Bob is being unfaithful with his suspicious behavior, which isn`t expounded on a lot, but is still a heavy theme for a kids' movie. Mr. Incredible, in a very depressing moment, locates the antagonist's computer database and discovers each superhero of his old gang has been eliminated. (Presumably killed off) He also locates the skeletal corpse of one in a cave. Syndrome briefly tortures Mr. I with electrical charges. And worst of all, Pixar marred their film with short-tempered Edna taking God's name in vain three times.THOGHTS: I still can't figure out what is missing from this movie. I'm sure some will agree with me, and some won`t, but I still insist that there's some element of this movie that is missing which could have made it a perfect ten. The transitions seemed rather sloppy, kind of chopped up and blended. They spend a lot of the movie talking, but somehow there's not enough slow tender moments. One local reviewer complained of just the opposite -- too much talk, not enough action. Perhaps that is true to some extent because I cannot think of any particular scenes that would be prime to watch over and over again. I also don't think we got to see enough of the Supers' powers in everyday life. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the Incredibles have always had their powers, so there's not a lot of exposition and development on them, like we'd see in such movies as Spider-Man or Superman, where we watch as their powers develop. There was also surprisingly a lot fewer characters in the film. Not even very many peripheral characters. Edna, Bob, Helen, Dash, Violet, Frozone (my favorite Super, and yet we don't see him much at all!) Syndrome, Mirage, carbon-clone servant villains, and a few citizens are about it. One would expect to be allowed to explore the unique world that Pixar sets up. Remember the scene were Marlin drops Nemo off at school, and you see the ocean's diversity, and several different off-the-cuff things like fish bouncing on sponges and swimming out of their mother's mouth? Or all the monsters in Monsters Inc. displaying their unique features? Those kinds of scenes, slice-of-life exposition scenes, are classic in most Pixar films, and absent from this one. I would have killed to see a scene with an Incredibles wedding reception where all the heroes are there, mingling, displaying their powers, intentionally, or inadvertently.I can't figure out what it is that's missing. Whatever it is, it's definitely not a deal-breaker. The movie is still dazzling and spectacular, and well-worth seeing. There'd better be a sequel.Trivia: Veteran Disney animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston make cameos as two old men congratulating the Supers and sending a double-message about animation: ""That's how it SHOULD be done!"""	4.0	It's - duh - Incredible!	2004-11-05	4	2	2
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A31SYY56CR1K0J	"David Anderson ""the monkey"""	"Growing up in the 60s with a monthly does of supers in comic book form was a way of life for me. The Incredibles was a return to the superhero fantasy of that place and time without leaving the grown-up drama of this one.The originality was a step up for computer generated cinema. Sure, there were the requisite good guys and bad guys, all with human qualities and problems, but the emotion of the characters was perfect. And as an imagined super as a child, now just another middle-aged, mild-mannered cog-in-the-machine, it was as if they were asking me where the super in me had gone. It makes you want to go out and be incredible.I wish there'd been more superheros in the movie since they did such a great job with the featured few. For this reason, ""No capes"" was one of my favorite scenes in the film .The ""100 mile dash"" was another favorite. The intensity was perfect. Looking down with a laugh and that extra burst was so well executed that that simple short clip deserves an award all by itself.I can't really say enough. It's possibly the best entertainment of its genre. I wouldn't change anything except to come out with a sequel. I want more."	5.0	Good story, great computer animation!	2006-02-25	1	1	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AO51B8NJY0SEU	David Bailey	I like The Incredibles, and was glad to find it available and reasonably priced.  The product arrived in a timely manner and was as advertised.By the way, I think Amazon's review guidelines are idiotic.  It's a DVD, not my first-born child.  If all I have to say is that the seller delivered the product as promised in a timely manner, that should be sufficient.  I shouldn't need to write a @*&$!! tome about the experience.The fact that I have little feedback to provide (none of it negative) is a GOOD thing.  That's how online shopping should be.Also, a few more words, just to make sure Amazon's review-reviewer-bot is happy:Fish.Eggs.Benzine.Tomatoes.Massachusetts.Enough words now, idiots?	5.0	As advertised	2013-10-29	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"Pixar continues to amaze with each succeeding film they make.  When I saw ""The Incredibles"" in the theatre I was blown away by the films striking visuals which I thought even surpassed their amazing work in ""Finding Nemo"".  What intrigued me in a second viewing of the film was the calibre of the writing.  Why I was looking for this aspect was that it was nominated for an Academy award for it's writing.  I can say with all certainty that this film is rich in texture, deep characterization, and magnificent storytelling.  Visuals are nice but if you don't have a good story to go with them, so what.  Director-writer Brad Bird successfully marries these two elements.  The film is more than deserving of the Oscar it received for best animated feature.  Inarguably it was one of the better films of 2004.  The Academy created the animated feature category so that high quality animated films did not have to compete with live action films.  If that category hadn't been created ""The Incredibles"" would have been very competitive with it's live action counterparts."	5.0	Incredible Writing	2005-03-25	4	2	2

So I was excited to see previews for ""The Incredibles"", it looked like the perfect family movie, something I could enjoy and the kids could as well. ""The Incredibles"" lives up to the hype. Both of my kids couldn't stop talking about it and want to go again...even (gasp!) choosing to see this again over Spongebob when it comes out! The story is a lot of fun, and it's funny, how now, as a 30+ year old cubicle dweller, I can relate to Mr. Incredible and his longing for past glories. Pixar's animation is, as always, a real treat. It's amazing how Pixar's characters just come to life, and express more emotional range than a gaggle full of Keanu Reeves. And though ""The Incredibles"" is rated PG, there is nothing in the film that should keep you from taking your kids. This really is a great family film, and one that adults will be able to enjoy as much as the kids."	5.0	Just a whole boatload of fun!	2004-11-15	118	106	12
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ	David M. Lovin	"Unlike Pixar's other animated classics like Toy Story and Finding Nemo, this one is not really geared toward kids.  Several times during the film, my daughter got a little freaked out and scared at the ""cartoon violence"" on the screen.  Your older kids will love it, however, and this is perfect for the adults.  Halfway through the movie, I realized that it didn't even seem like an animated movie to me anymore.  It all seemed real because the story is complex, sharp, original, funny, and something to cheer about all at the same time.I loved the voice casting.  Craig T. Nelson is heroic sounding Bob Paar/Mr. Incredible, who never stops wanting to be a hero even when the world turns its back on him.  Holly (Turn to the right!) Hunter is one of my favorite actresses and has a great turn as Elastigirl/Mrs. Paar.  Samuel L. Jackson is somewhat underused as Frozone, Bob's friend and fellow super hero, while Jason Lee is the villain, Syndrome, who as a child idolized Mr. Incredible, but was spurned by the hero and just wants his day in the sun.  Another of my favorite small time actors, Wallace Shawn, has a tiny role of Bob's boss at the insurance company.This is probably Pixar's best offering.  I never buy DVDs sight unseen, but this had such great publicity, I took the chance.  It's awesome.  It looks great, sounds good, has a fun, interesting storyline, and even takes a shot at today's culture, including our somewhat litigious society. (The reason Mr. Incredible becomes Bob Paar is that he is forced into hiding from being sued by someone whose life he saved, but who was injured in the process).  It's really a fun popcorn film, and how many animated films can carry that title?  A grand slam home run in every sense of the word."	5.0	I bought the DVD unseen and was not disappointed	2005-03-23	6	4	2

For anyone who has seen the movie, they know how good it was, and it hadn't lost anything in the transition to DVD.  Still a great, action-packed and funny movie.The additional extras on disc 2 are also well worth a look.  For those who enjoy the process of making movies, there is a storyboard-like series on things they wanted to do with the story but did not.  The ""outtakes"", which combine some computer generated goofs like messed up hair and clothes along with intentionally created gaffes, are enjoyable.  There is a section on the superheroes of the story, and a special short about baby Jack-Jack that is too funny to describe.The Incredibles will find a place in the rotation of movies we watch often, and with the new features in a second dsic, we can only hope for a sequel."	5.0	Great movie and  plenty of extras	2005-03-22	4	3	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3MAZM138KFVOW	D. Blackdeer	"Disney-Pixar's 2004 animated feature about a super hero and his family who come out of hiding to battle a new villain.  Mr. Incredible and his wife Elastigirl live quiet normal lives as Bob and Helen Parr in suburbia under government supervision due to previous public lawsuits that put them and other superheroes out of business.  All is not well though as their superhero instincts and talents clash with mundane work and little excitement.  Elastigirl has managed to adapt, but Mr. Incredible discreetly moonlights with his pal Frozone on ""bowling night"" saving people from fires and knocking out common criminals.  Mixed in this trial are the children Dash and Violet, confused about their inherited superpowers while trying to cope with the difficult social challenges at school.  Lastly is Jack-Jack the baby brother who appears to have been spared of any super talents.Just when Mr. Incredible feels he has hit rock-bottom, he's hired by an apparent secret government organization to defeat a renegade robot at their base on a remote island.  Mr. Incredible is successful and looks forward to more exciting assignments.  It isn't long, however, before he finds out he's been duped into serving as a test bed for robots at the hands of Syndrome, an evil genius posing as a new superhero through clever gadgets.  When Elastigirl learns of her husband's whereabouts, she heads out via jet to find out what's going on.  Dash and Violet secretly follow their mom, and through a series of events, all find themselves battling Syndrome and his army of bad guys and robots.This is a gem of an animated feature.  While Pixar has ratcheted another progressive advance in animation, the characters and the story are terrific and not overshadowed by the techno-visual display.  Dash and Violet are a joy to watch as they learn how to use their superpowers in the fight against evil, especially Dash's chase sequence when he's pursued by  bad guys flying saucer hovercraft.  Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl sorting out their family problems in the midst of this excitement are humorous and all the actors who voice the characters could not have done better.  And not to be forgotten, Jack-Jack reveals his special powers near the conclusion of this feature.Obviously the ending of this movie leaves options open for a sequel, and while this looks like a promising proposition, Pixar will have to work hard to compliment this feature successfully."	5.0	The Incredibles	2005-05-28	3	2	1

THE INCREDIBLES (forgive the clich&eacute;) is just that: absolutely incredible!  The movie has something for everyone, and it's hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this movie.The idea behind the plot was truly creativity in action: a super-hero family in a government relocation program trying to fit in with normal society.  But the dad (Mr. Incredible portrayed by Craig T. Nelson) was the Superman of his day and, along with his best friend and fellow super-hero (Fro-Zone played by Samuel L. Jackson), desperately wants to relive the glory days.The film also boasts such voices as Holly Hunter and Wallace Shawn (i.e. ""Inconceivable!"" from THE PRINCESS BRIDE).  It's loaded with witty one-liners, thrills, and even a little situational comedy rarely seen in movies like this one.I'm not usually the kind of moviegoer who wants sequels to great films.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	"I was completely unprepared to like this computer-animated film.  A smart, witty script, excellent animation by Pixar, and the talented voices of Holly Hunter, Craig T. Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson, and filmmaker Brad Bird have combined to create a winner that both kids and adults will appreciate, albeit on different levels.  Mr. Incredible (Nelson) loves saving the world, even though he likens it to cleaning a room only to turn around and find it messy again.  His soon-to-be wife Elastigirl (Hunter) is just as tough in her pursuit of justice, and often comes to her beloved's rescue.  The city is full of super heroes who do the work of police and who receive thunderous applause after their life-saving exploits.  Unfortunately for the super heroes, their glory days fade in a hail of lawsuits (people don't want to be saved and others use their injuries while in peril against the super heroes), and so all those with superpowers must enter normal life in a kind of witness-protection program.  The Incredibles, now with three children, face a mundane life as Bob/Mr. Incredible supports the family with an insurance adjuster job, and Helen/Elastigirl struggles to stop sibling squabbles.  Helen and Bob have become archetypal suburban parents, arguing about the kids and chores.  Bob and his friend Frozone (Jackson) long for the good old days when they felt like real men.  When Bob blows his cover, he is recruited by the mysterious Mirage (Elizabeth Pena) for some top secret superhero work.  Of course, Helen knows nothing about it--she's too busy dealing with baby Jack Jack, risk-taking Dash, and reclusive teenager Violet.  Predictably, Bob gets into trouble, and Helen has no choice but to don her old costume.  Fashion designer Edna (Bird) gives the Incredibles both the push and the pizzazz they need to reclaim their rightful spots as superheroes.The strength of this movie is the action-packed plot coupled with witty satire about contemporary American life.  Like all aging suburbanites, the Incredibles have developed beer guts (Bob) and wide hips (Helen).  They argue about issues that couples argue about everywhere, from financial concerns to not taking asked-for advice to ignoring the needs of the other.  The young Helen is a feminist who refuses to leave saving the world ""to the men,"" but she becomes a stay-at-home mom who shuttles the kids to and from school, cooks family dinners, and finds herself responsible for almost all of the kids' upbringing.  The young Bob revels in his prowess, but in middle age he is beaten down by bureaucracy and a junky car.  Small details, such as the ""graduation"" between fourth and fifth grade and the way lawsuits twist the truth, make these otherwise extraordinary people ordinary.This sharp-witted adventure movie will delight both kids and adults.  The hilarious extra ""Jack Jack Attack"" should not be missed, especially since it fills in some details referred to in the movie itself.  Buy or rent this movie - and prepare yourself for some real entertainment."	5.0	Super Heroes Meet Suburbia	2005-06-30	54	45	9

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"While it may not be a completely original idea, ""The Incredibles"" is an action-packed, thoroughly amusing piece of computer animation, containing the vocal talents of Craig T.Nelson as Robert Parr/Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as his wife Helen/Elastagirl,  Samuel L. Jackson as the cool(in every sense of the word) Lucius Best/Frozone, and  director Brad Bird as the diminutive superhero costume designer Edna (E) Mode as the principal characters.We are introduced to the superheroes as young adults expressing their views, and in one instance, the pitfalls of being a superhero in interviews.Then we see them in action, observing Mr. Incredible's might, Elastagirl's grace and flexibility, and Frozone's lithe ability freeze things, all en route to the wedding of the first two characters. An overzealous fan named Buddy Pine hinders Mr. Incredible's ability to do his job in the process of an unwarranted audition as the superhero's sidekick. Having firmly discouraged the young boy from joining him in his crime-fighting duties in the past, he uses a more combative approach the last time around--an act that will come back to haunt him.An amusing touch of realism follows as Mr. Incredible is sued by a man injured  when the superhero saves him from a suicide attempt, and then by the survivors of an el train incident. A wave of lawsuits against superheroes by an ungrateful public forces all superheroes underground.15 years later, we find Mr. Incredible as average, everyday Bob Parr, working for an insurance company, getting his expressed wish to lead the normal life that he had sometimes wanted to lead. But his generous nature towards his clients clashes with company policy, much to the dismay of his boss (voiced by an exasperated Wallace Shawn). He and his family suffer because they are denied the right to be the extraordinary people they truly are.Meanwhile, Helen Parr has to deal with her son, Dashiell's (Spencer Fox's) disruptive behavior in school, which is largely the result of his mother's refusal to let her superfast son compete in sports.Daughter, Violet (Sarah Vowell) pines for a popular boy at school, but has a typical adolescent's  self-consciousness about being different. The only one without problems is that Parr's adorable infant son, Jack-Jack.Family tensions reach their height during a dinner session at which the family display the powers they hide from the world.Parr keeps the loss of his job a secret from Helen, and goes on under-cover work with Lucius--the only superhero friend he sees anymore--which, over time, has become riskier and riskier.  Surveillance  by the green-eyed, exotic Mirage (Elizabeth Pena), who has all the mystique of a Bond Girl, results in Bob's resumption of the hero work he loves. We see how this makes him a happier man, a more flirtatious husband, as well as a more attentive and affectionate father.In the meantime, he  visits the stylish and eccentric Edna for the refurbishing of his supersuit.As Parr travels to the location of his new assignment, Helen learns the truth about his whereabouts, and after being challenged by a learning robot that has been created for destructive purposes, Mr. Incredible discovers  who is behind his being lured to that area, and made to recall a certain incident from the past.It has been observed that many tragedies in life occur because someone wanted to feel important. The murderous and vengeful Syndrome(voiced by Jason Lee) is just such a person. Unable to fulfill his dreams of being a superhero in his youth, and still too petty to consider the legal ramifications of a superhero taking a minor on a crimefighting mission even as an adult, he proves to be  the Incredibles' great nemesis, and he still fails to make an impressive showing as a superhero even as an adult. The lesson offered by this story is that while hard work and innovativeness, such as Syndrome displays, are to be admired, natural and exceptional abilities are specially catagorized for a reason.The natural abilities of the superheroes made them privy to a certain insider's knowledge about suprhero costumes that Syndrome, the innovative outsider, isn't, which will be his undoing. Syndrome might have been a happier person if he had accepted that he wasn't meant to do what his one-time idol did, and found a better use for his own abilities.Highly reminiscent of the story line for ""Amadeus"", where a rival in a certain field tries to destroy one with a phenomenal natual ability who, in some way, has disappointed him, and pass himself off as having that natual ability,the story is, as many have noted, an animated version of James Bond, and as is often the case with modern animation, the personalities of the actors come through, and audiences can easily forget it is a computerized cartoon because the characters are so life-like. It's a fun story in which to lose onself, and a terrific piece of animation for all ages.Once again, a masterful effort from the crew of Pixar!"	5.0	Some of Us Have It, Some of Us Don't.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	"In 2004, Pixar Animated Studios would go on to unfamiliar territory and that is creating a film not based on animals or insects but to create an animated film featuring humans.With the first five animated films from Pixar Animation Studios/Walt Disney having great financial success, needless to say, there was a lot of challenges and stress that the crew had to face this time around and to spearhead the project was Brad Bird, the writer and director who has worked on ""The Simpsons"" and ""The Iron Giant"" (and would go on to direct the Pixar animated film, ""Ratatouille"".Needless to say, ""The Incredibles"", which was budgeted at $92 million became a box office success, earning over $631 million worldwide, receiving nearly positive reviews from all critics and winning two Oscars for ""Best Achievement in Sound Editing"" and ""Best Animated Feature Film of the Year"".And now this successful animated film receives its HD treatment with a new Blu-ray release in April 2011 featuring new special features.VIDEO:""The Incredibles"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:39:1).  First, let me first say that even though this animated film was released back in 2004 and within the improvement of computer animation in the last six years, the film still manages to hold up very well!  In fact, this is probably the best video version to date as the Blu-ray really shows off the vibrant colors of the film.Hair strands are much more notable, but also the detail of the fabric of the clothing is also much more present and detailed that you can see the actual stitching.  Blacks are inky and deep and the special effects absolutely look awesome.  And while I didn't see any compression artifacts or any major defects on the picture quality, I did notice very little banding.  In one scene, where Mr. Incredible shows off his new red costume, you can see a little banding but really, this is the best I have seen of ""The Incredibles"" by far.  From the debris, to the presentation of the city and jungle landscape, this film looks awesome on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Incredibles"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 2.0 DVS, French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1.  And if there was one thing that really shined for this film on Blu-ray, it was the lossless soundtrack as not only was dialogue crisp but every sound and boom, you can feel it via LFE.  I love action films that know how to use the LFE and really make you fel it and in this case, ""The Incredibles"" delivers!  Also, the surround channels are well-utilized as you can hear various ambiance from surrounding objects to little rustling that can be heard as well.  Literally, the lossless soundtrack delivers in immersive sound that really gives you a feeling of the action that is taking place!  Awesome!After watching ""The Incredibles"" so many times on DVD, the soundtrack, while very good, never made me take notice as it did with it listening to it on Blu-ray.  Not only was this lossless soundtrack magnificent, it definitely make a big difference during my viewing and enhanced my love for the film.  Audiophiles will love the lossless soundtrack!As for subtitles, they are in English, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Incredibles"" comes with the following special features:DISC 1* Director's Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by producer John Walker and director Brad Bird.

Also, included is a digital copy of the feature film which works with iTunes and Windows Media Player.JUDGMENT CALL:Pixar is known for creating a good number of wonderful films but I have to admit that ""The Incredibles"" has continued to become one of my favorites and probably is the only Pixar animated film that I have watch possibly over a dozen times and have not gotten tired of it.I remember when I first watched the film, I was just amazed not just by the animation and design but also the storyline and the relationship between Bob and Helen and just grown-up things that happen in the film that probably would fly over the head of children but make the adults smile.And I'm sure that many people own this film on DVD, it's whether or not you want to upgrade to the Blu-ray version.  And the answer to that is YES!  You do want to upgrade as it is not only jsut a better video and audio transfer but you also have new special features featuring the crew of ""The Incredibles"" really giving us fantastic insight of what went on behind-the-scenes in the creation of this film.We hear about the challenges and the long hours it takes to create an animated film but in the case of ""The Incredibles"", I never knew that a higher-up at Disney opposed the film, I never knew about the intense feelings the crew had and how morale was low at one point because of communication issues.  There was a lot of things that happened during the making of this film and you start to realize how much of a challenge these individuals, these departments at Pixar had to face when creating this film.  Definitely it was not easy but at the end of the day, the entire crew delivered another Pixar hit!Not only was it well-received, not only did it make a lot of money but it was a film that managed to hook in both young and old.  And it's important to note that at the time when Pixar Animation Studios had films based on toys, insects, animals, etc., to have an all-human based storyline that was well-planned, well-written and well-executed made ""The Incredibles"" so entertaining and fun!Peter Travers of Rolling Stone Magazine wrote that ""The Incredibles"" was #6 on his list of the best films of the decade and to tell you the truth, when I think about films that I have watched more than 3-5 times in the last decade, there are not many.  ""The Incredibles"", I have probably watched about a dozen times or even more than that.  There are not many films that deal with many realistic issues that couples face and yet putting a superhero/sci-fi twist to it, ""The Incredibles"" is an exciting film that will continue to entertain generations to come.""The Incredibles: 4-Disc Combo Pack"" is an excellent release.  A first Blu-ray disc with the movie and new special features, a second Blu-ray with new and all the classic DVD special features, a DVD and also a digital copy of the film.  This is truly a magnificent release from Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment and fans should be happy with this release, especially with how awesome this film looks on Blu-ray and its wonderful lossless soundtrack.Highly recommended!"	5.0	Blu-ray: New special features, awesome PQ & AQ - MUST BUY for those who loves this film!	2011-04-13	82	76	6

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AZXFMHSH6VSTS	DesignManiac	"This film is a masterpiece - certainly the best cartoon I have ever seen, and one of the very best films in any genre - period. The film stars a family of superheroes - the Parr's - who are forced into hiding because of a series of ridiculous lawsuits (Bob Parr: ""I saved your life!"", suicide guy: ""No, you ruined my death!""). The crazy fan ""I know all your moves"", who irritates Bob to the point of blunt rejection. The ejector seat - a spoof of the Bond Goldfinger movie. The evil madman (""Syndrome"" - a set of conditions pointing to a type of disease!) owns an island called ""no-man-is-an"", and many other jokes. It is also fun to contrast the hilarious attempts of the family to blend in (daughter Violet: ""normal - the only one in this family who's normal is Jack-Jack, and he's not even toilet trained!"") with the dangers they later face. Bob longs for the days to be a hero again, and to see him contain himself is just hilarious, and yet sympathetic at the same time. Its interesting to see them develop in confidence, and learn to use their powers in new ways. Finally, I enjoyed seeing them learn to work together as a family - transitioning from the mundane (borderline dysfunctional) to a formidable team. The ""Jack Jack Attack"" short movie on disk 2 fits in with the main film, and is also hilarious. The early Bond-style band music also suits the film perfectly - and even outdoes it. It could appeal to some kids who have the attention span to follow a story, but I think it has more appeal for adults who can admire creativity and craftsmanship. Worth multiple viewings. Worth every penny."	5.0	Excellent entertainment on many levels	2006-11-10	1	1	0

After a rescue attempt in which he is sued by the guy he saved who actually was trying to end his life, the saved guy who is injured and in great pain sues Mr. Incredible and a wave of public backlash against the superheroes of the world ensues with many superheroes all over the world being the target of numerous lawsuits. Breaking down under pressure from the public outcry, Mr. Incredible retires from the superhero business and goes into a typical life in suburbia under the name of Robert Parr. With Incredible retiring, many other superheroes are placed under government protection and are protected by hidden identities.15 years go buy during that time Parr settles down and raises a family with his wife and three children in suburbia but life is complicated as Elastigirl (Helen Parr) juggles family life with keeping superhero powers secret but then it really hits the fan when Robert Parr is forced to return to the superhero business and Parr who dons the uniform for the first time in more than a decade goes on a top secret mission to fight against a dangerous robot and is sidelined when a renegade menace named Syndrome who was actually a die-hard fan in the past plots to destroy the former Superheroes as well as his former idol.Now the whole family must go over the to island where Mr. Incredible is held prisoner at and bring an end to Syndrome's nefarious anti-superhero plot before the robot wreaks massive amounts of havoc and destruction on Metropolis.""The Incredibles"" is the fastest paced Pixar animated movie that I've ever seen and like the five Pixar movies before then, this animated feature continues the streak of unparalleled originality that only Pixar seem to generate and bring to the big screen. While not on the `wow' scale of ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Finding Nemo"", the animation is great and unparalleled.  Who knows what Pixar will come up with next. Go and see this movie today!

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2WP0GOTX13MG4	"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff"""	"'The Incredibles' tells the story of a family of 'supers.'  In this story, super heros were forced to give up a life of fighting crime and super villains by a suit crazy public.  Turns out, in this alternative to reality, the average joe is just as likely to sue a super hero that saved the world, but maybe destroyed his house in the process.  Granted amnesty by the government, the super heroes go into a version of the witness relocation program and take on everyday lives.One such hero, Mr. Incredible, voiced by Craig Nelson, is having a hard time making the adjustment.  He has married another hero, called Elastigirl, and they have raised a family, each of which is possessed of super skills.  Desperate for excitement, Mr. Incredible goes out with Frozone, voiced by Samuel Jackson, to fight a little crime undercover.  This gets them noticed, and before he knows it, Mr. Incredible has a top secret crime fighting job on the side.  Or so it would appear...This movie definitely deserved the Oscar award for best animated feature.  The animation is top of the line.  The action scenes are exciting, and despite the cartoon appearance, can be breathtaking.  There is an ample amount of good comedy as well.  The movie also has a few morales (such as be comfortable with who you are, be honest to your family, etc. etc.), but none of them get in the way of enjoying the film.The DVD extras are priceless.  Be sure to check out the ""Top Secret"" files in which is included a short animated cartoon (not with computer graphics) in which the characters Mr. Incredible and Frozone offer commentary.  Its silly without the commentary, but incredibly funny with it.  Also, the files on the various heroes are fun.  Make sure to check out the audio file that accompanies each one.This is a great movie for families.  Kids will love the super hero action and some of the silliness.  Parents will get sucked in as well.  You can't help but do so.  There are some story lines definitely geared for adults, but not inappropriate for children.  I highly recommend this movie.Overall:  5 stars."	5.0	Definitely Worth the Oscar	2005-03-20	2	2	0

Mere mortals now the Par family have assumed the life of an everyday ordinary family, until Bob Par (Mr Incredible) secretly is called back in to action.  Once one of the world's top masked crime fighter, Bob finds himself a bit out of shape but reinvigorated by the mysterious challenge.  The family consists of  Bob, Helen, and their kids Violet, Dash and baby Jack-Jack all of which have special powers.  The story like most cartoons pits good against evil however this story forces the entire family to band together to discover and/or rediscovery their true source of power. - each other.SIDE NOTE:  I don't want to ruin it for you so I will just say that idea behind the villian is a pretty cool as well.As a dad with two small kids, and after having watched many hours of video cartoons on ""movie night"" my FIRST choice when watching a DVD after the kids go to bed is NEVER a cartoon.  I must say ""The Incredibles"" has just changed my mind.  My only regret after buying it on DVD was that I wish I had seen it in the theater too!My 7 yr old daughter has already asked if we can get her the Violet costume for her birthday.  I had to pick my jaw up off the floor!  Like most 7 year girls, her first choice has ALWAYS been the Princess stuff from Disney.  This movie and character has changed everything!After watching it last night, and as a computer tech, I woke up this morning STILL thinking about the unbelievable computer graphics.  They are REALLY good - No, INCREDIBLE!!Some movies you buy just to complete the collection for the kids, this movie is a MUST have, especially if you like action adventure!!!!  Some of the action scenes at the end may be a little scary for 4 year olds and younger - so you may want to watch it with them.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1AYEI2SNFPYES	Dogville	The Incredibles is truly a visually stunning animation by the creative team at Pixar. Behind the excellent visuals is an extremely well-told superhero tale.It mixes elements from yesteryear's superhero stories that we have come to known with modern day relevance to good effect. The story talks about outlawed and middle-aged ex-superhero Mr Incredible trying to regain his former glory by taking on a secret assignment at the risk of his family's safety (though he married a superhero Elastigirl and their offsprings weld super powers too). What ensued is a series of action-packed pursuits and good-versus-evil duals.The animation also takes the opportunity to take a stab at modern society with the appearance of super-bi*ch designer Edna Mode who used to design superhero suits but has taken on the task of dressing up supermodels whom she absolutely dislikes. Her 10-minute odd appearance is simply memorable as her motor-mouth and clever wit are irresistably charming. And the surprise is that the director/writer Brad Bird himself whodid the voiceover for the character.This is a far more superior animation than the shallow Shark Tale and it all goes to show that it's possible to put together a successful animation without the need for big name voiceovers.A* entertainment for kids and adults alike.	5.0	Incredible!!!	2004-11-28	1	1	0

I hope this movie is a sign of the end of his reign of terror.  This movie does not have any leftist slants or attempts to brainwash children with his liberal way of thinking.  It is a good movie with some great action and wonderful animation.There are some rather intense battle scenes that some of the younger kids might freak out at.  I would recommend the younger children not see this if they don't like that type of quick action.  The humor element was subtle but definitely present in this movie.

I love all their films and having to pick one as your favorite is a really tough decision that has to be done with some serious thinking. They're that good. Still, as fantastic as every Pixar film is, I've always have had a softer spot for The Incredibles and I have to call it my favorite Pixar film.Since its release in 2004, TI has been one of my favorite films of all time. The story is excellent, the characters are endearing, it's action packed and has amazing animation. Brad Bird really created a masterpiece. TI resonate in so many levels because it's not only a fantastic super hero film, it's also a fantastic film about family, relationships, and a lot more. It's really a very sophisticated movie that perhaps will entertain the adults more than the children but, as with every Pixar film, TI has a wide appeal and is high quality entertainment for everyone.At long last, Disney has released the film in Blu-Ray and what a release it is!!!Video & Audio:As with every Pixar film on Blu, it's no surprise that TI comes to HD looking absolutely demo-quality. The level of sharpness and detail is mesmerizing, colors are bright and blacks are balanced. Also, compression artifacts are nowhere to be found in the print. The DVD looked great for SD but looking TI on Blu is like watching it all over again and is a joy to do it. A fantastic transfer through and through.The audio features a 5.1 DTS-HD MA that will absolutely will knock you out!!! The sound is so clear, so vibrant that you will believe the crashings and the bangings are happening in your living room. Dialogue is also crystal clear. An absolutely excellent audio.Bonus Features:The 2-Disc Collector's edition DVD has a lot of insightful material that fortunately gets carried over to this 2-disc Blu-Ray which is chocked full of bonus goodies. Aside from all the DVD features (that include galleries, a making-of feauterette, trailers, character designs and much much more), The Incredibles BD has also some new material that will enhance your viewing. First and most important is the featurette ""The Incredibles Revisited"" which is a roundtable with Brad Bird and all the collaborators who did the picture. Is an excellent reminiscing piece with great anecdotes that will increase the love for the film. Also you got a PIP commentary on the excellent short ""Jack-Jack Attack"", a new interactive program about Syndrome's Island, Pixar anecdotes and the now customary Paths to Pixar featurette that in this time features the Story Artists. Also you got two audiocommentaries and the short ""Bounding"".This two BD set will leave you exhausted because is so full of material about the film that you will become an Incredibles expert. An excellent set all around.Aside from the two BDs, this set also contain a DVD and a Digital Copy.Sneak Peeks:Only two Sneek Peaks are found in this set:Cars 2 (in theaters June 24)The Lion King: Diamond Edition (On BD and DVD this Fall)Closing thoughts:The Incredibles is another example of how good Pixar is. It's a masterpiece and this new BD set, with amazing picture & sound and hours upon hours of bonus features, it's a must-own release.

The lawsuits that put the ""Supers"" out of business is certainly a real gem and it gives Brad Bird who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"" some unexplored avenues to try, which he does and it turned out, well - - PRETTY INCREDIBLE!WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT:First we have the husband and wife superhero team that never has a chance to team up as ""Supers"" and instead turns into Mr. & Mrs. Average American after the lawsuits that ended the ""Supers"" crime fighting dynasty. Along the way they had three very different yet ""Super"" offspring! Wow, that's enough right there to keep us busy.We also have sub-plots which include each one of the 3 children's coming of age in a ""Super"" way, but as ordinary kids. The kids, like their parents, struggle all the way through the film to get to where they go and they grow in the process individually and as a family.We have Bob Parr [Mr. Incredible] going through what appears to be a mid-life crisis, and his confused wife, Helen, who just wants them all to fit in like everybody else. But, after all, how can ""Elastigirl"" be just another soccer mom? We have the return of a hostile and dysfunctional former fan [Buddy] who turns ""The Incredibles"" lives upside-down and inside-out. For the first time, the ""Supers"" are the underdogs!EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS - SATISFYING FAMILY ISSUES & MUCH MORE:After these elements are set into motion, we have EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS, and it is fascinating to see all the Incredibles' family issues worked out like any other family's, but with many interesting twists. ""The Incredibles"" is a SUPER film!ABOUT THE DVD:DVD FEATURES: Anamorphic Widescreen 2.39:1 [very widescreen] Digital to Digital Transfer is the SHARPEST I have seen yet!Lots of features and deleted scenes as well as some early concepts for different ways of introducing the characters make me grateful they made it the way they did.The ""Jack-Jack Attack"" is probably the high point of the features and illustrates what we did not see going on between ""Jack-Jack"" and the baby-sitter. I just wish it was longer. The behind the scenes ""Featurettes"" are worth watching as are the blooper scenes, though they seem a bit contrived.There are two commentary tracks, one with Brad Bird [writer/director] and John Walker [producer]. and another with the animators. I could not watch the entire movie with either track on. Maybe you can. The files about the ""Supers"" are interesting. There is lots more. If you like to go in for it, you can spend the day with the features alone.BOTTOM LINE:For me, however, there is the film. This is the best animated film, in my opinion, and is perfect for all members of the family (of all ages) to connect with in a fun-filled, family sort of way. It has all of the entertainment value of ""Toy Story"" or ""Finding Nemo"", but has more appeal for adult audiences in my view."	5.0	TERRIFIC ENTERTAINMENT AND IDEAL FOR REPEATED VIEWINGS  - - -  OFTEN	2006-01-13	3	2	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1TJIJKKN15KR9	drqshadow	The standard-bearer of excellence for the Pixar animation house has aged well in the seven years since its release, and it should be no surprise. With a clever, all-ages sense of humor, a masterfully paced storyline, wonderfully rounded characters and genuinely perfect casting, the filmmakers have left little cause for concern. Spotted throughout with nods, winks and nudges of all shapes and sizes for the dedicated comic book fans that are bound to be in the audience, the plot remains easily-accessible for those who may have never even seen a funny book. On top of that, its excellent sense of timing and regular ability to one-up itself is more than enough to ensure no eyeballs wander far from the center of the screen. The perfect family film, it's also something I have no shame over watching repeatedly by my lonesome. Looks even better than I remembered in brilliant Blu-Ray quality.	5.0	Pixar's Masterpiece Does Everything Right	2011-09-09	2	2	0

Probably one of the greatest animated films of all time, this film plays great for adults and kids.A brilliant spoof of the Super Hero and Secret Agent/Spy genres The Incredibles not only feels like a serious live action film, it surpasses the majority of them in every way. The animation is stunning and the music score and characters are pitch perfect in the super entertaining action film packed film.This is my favorite Pixar film next to WALL E. The Blu Ray carries over all important bonus features from the original 2 disc DVD set and the picture and sound receive a flawless upgrade to Blu Ray.

Great heroics, comedy, and a message- all the things a comic should be are brought out in this movie that is at once a tribute and send up of Superheroes.Sadly, the things that make Pixar movies really unique, the extra's, are just not even there.  Anyone who loved the bloopers in Bugs Life, Toy Story et al. will be dissapointed to find that the ""Bloopers"" here are simply animation flubs/computer rendering mistakes- or things that look like ""last minute additions"".  The ""Deleted Scenes"" are storyboards with slight b/w animation.  The ""Bounding"" (a shaved sheep and a Jackalope musical number) thing is just odd...nowhere near as clever as the old man playing chess with himself.  The little movie with the baby, an event that takes place during the main movie, was funny, but could have been on the end of disk 1.Really, disk 2?  Why bother, Pixar?

HARDEN ""a movie fan"""	"At first I was really upset with the makers of this story, as the Characters have powers from both Marvel and DC Comics.  But, when I finally saw the movie on cable, I had to admit, I actually liked it, a lot!  Let me lay out their powers:Mr. Incredible:1. Super strength (ala DC Comics Superman, Uncle Sam)Ms. Incredible:1. Streching ability (ala Marvel's Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, DC's Elongated Man)Violet:1. Ability to generate force fields and go invisible (ala Marvel's Sue Richards of the Fantastic Four and Jane Grey of the X-Men)Dash:1. Super Speed (ala DC's Kid Flash)Jack-Jack:1. Morphing Ability (his name escapes me, but I remember the Character ""The Element Man"" - I believe DC comics).After I got over my ""prejudice,"" I found the movie very well done...they spent a buck (or two) making this feature.  Edna's security system just cracks me up!Finally, Congress should be mandated to watch Mr. Syndrome's character and learn from his dialogue.

Day ""ENIGMA"""	If you've ever read any of my reviews, you already know that the only time I make a comment and post it, is in the event that I felt the movie an absolute terror not worthy of mention, or a simple cant miss (i don't think ill ever post a two or three start to be honest). Now, for all those who said that THE INCREDIBLES was a good movie, I must take a moment to correct such a horrid and despicable LIE. This movie was not good, IT WAS A TRIUMPH unlike many any will ever see, no matter what your age. If I could give this movie 6 stars id still feel id be cheating it. The only horror in this movie would be if a sequel weren't made. I happen to have a pretty good library of super hero movies, and in all honesty I went into this movie not wanting to like it, feeling that it might cheapen and mock the intenseness and nostalgia found in the classics of Superman, Batman,(if such a thing were possible lol) and the like. However, this movie took all that was good in such movies and made it better, and more fun to watch. Its kinda sad that many actors in today's movies play such horrid roles (and simply are such terrible actors) that you really don't care about them one way or another (live or die), yet in this movie where you know the characters aren't real, one does care. Sadly, one of the weak points of my reviews is that I don't like to play a spoiler by giving the movie away, so all ill say is this, I don't care if you are 1 or 193, rent it, buy it, (or take it from a friend) (yea I know that's wrong lol) but watch this movie whatever it takes.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"In a certain way, it's a shame that each new Pixar feature signals such an onslaught of media hype and mass merchandising that for a segment of the viewing public like myself, the film becomes anathema to our sensibilities. At least that's my excuse for waiting so long to see the 2004 entry from the state-of-the-art animation studio. Directed and written by Brad Bird, this one is indeed different from its predecessors, straying away from more kid-friendly messages and characters in favor of straight-ahead action and a decidedly adult perspective on the power of family and self-worth.  Combine a smart, heartfelt script that addresses these themes intelligently with of course, the predictably amazing animation, and the result is a startling creation that sharpens the mind as well as dazzles the senses.The plot revolves around a superhero, Mr. Incredible, whose heroic rescues have been met in the cynical early nineties with lawsuits around personal damages and privacy issues. After getting married to fellow superhero, Elastigirl, he is banished into a relocation program and forced to live solely as their secret identities. Fifteen years later, Mr. Incredible is now just Bob, a bored insurance agent raising three kids (Christina Ricci look-alike Violet, mischievous speedster Dash and baby Jack-Jack) with his wife Helen, the former Elastigirl. But he can't get his heroic nature out of his system, as he moonlights on weekly ""bowling nights"" with fellow retired superhero, Frozone, to perform feats of derring-do in order to save lives. Enter Mirage, a mysterious woman who offers Bob an opportunity to resume his former identity on a remote volcanic island. There, Mr. Incredible meets up with his nemesis, Syndrome, a techno-nerd who used to worship his now middle-aged and beer-bellied adversary and now has a dastardly plan to kill off all the superheroes. Of course this means his entire family needs to use their individual superpowers to thwart the plan before the world becomes a battlefield of destruction.How the plot twists and turns will remind you less of Pixar's previous concoctions but rather the James Bond franchise, ""Star Wars"" in all its iterations, Japanese anime and the outsider mindset of the X-Men. From the faux-archival footage at the beginning, the visual invention is continuously breathtaking all the way to the inevitable ending. Like all the Pixar films though, the vocal talent is a perfect match for the visuals - Craig T. Nelson's comically sincere baritone as Bob, Holly Hunter's unmistakably defiant twang as Helen (her cartoon counterpart even has Hunter's upper lip curl), Samuel L. Jackson's street-smart voice underutilized as Frozone, and Bird himself providing the pretentious, pseudo-Milanese voice of avant-garde clothing designer Edna. The animation of the humans is obviously stylized but remarkably convincing capturing expressions with surprising subtlety. The location animation is just as impressive.This is one DVD package brimming with worthwhile extras. First, the direct digital transfer and the Dolby Digital 5.1 EX soundtrack are phenomenal, replicating the in-theater experience as much as technologically possible. Bird and producer John Walker provide insightful commentary on an alternate track. Thirteen of the massive army of animators provide commentary on another track, and it makes for essential listening to techno-geeks interested in the meticulous preparation and execution of the animation. Disc 2 has two great shorts: ""Jack-Jack Attack"", which shows us what happened at home with the babysitter as the rest of the family was out saving the world, and ""Boundin'"", created by Bud Luckey, about a dancing sheep who learns from a jackalope how to cope with his life between shearings.There is a series of deleted scenes, most understandably excised, including an alternate opening, all in the unfinished storyboard format. Also included are two making-of documentaries, both really intriguing looks at the hugely collaborative effort involved. But the funniest piece may be the faux-ancient cartoon, ""Mr. Incredible and Pals"", which hilariously uses the old live lip-action technique of the early sixties and includes a Caucasian-ized Frozone and a sidekick bunny named Mr. Skipperdoo. Definitely listen to the scripted inanity of Nelson and especially Jackson commenting on how bad it is on an alternate track.  Faux-interviews with the cartoon characters, teaser trailers and an extensive photo gallery complete perhaps the most extensive set of extras I have seen with a movie. Great movie and a great package."	5.0	Bird's Grownup Sensibilities Inform Another Pixar Masterwork	2005-03-27	4	2	2

An over-hyped movie, with nothing but a predictable, stupid storyline.

I believe it will be seen in the dvd version as a 'deleted scene' as I honestly don't remember seeing it in that 1 1/2 hours of film time.  You heard correctly, it's a full- length feature film and just because it's animated doesn't mean it's something just for kids. I've been a Pixar fan since ""Toy Story"", and I didn't have any kids at that time.  So , I warn parents of small children - You may have yourself a tough time trying to get toddling kiddies or drooling babies to sit through this one.My son, who is almost 4, was entranced..he loved it. His ending review was in one word: Awesome.Being a fan of cartoons, superheroes(watching super friends every saturday am growing up), and the everchanging face of the animated film, I have to agree with my roving movie reviewing son.It was the idea of 'retired' superheros, who come back to save the world that struck me as a unique idea for a movie. Plus, seeing one of them get way out of shape and then whip himself back into shape is one of the funniest parts of the movie.It did drag a bit, but I felt very much entertained by most parts.

I finally got around to renting the movie. I have to say I absolutely loved the film.""The Incredibles"" revolves around Bob and Helen Parr who back in the day were known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl. Because of lawsuits, Mr.Incredible and Elastigirl are forced into retirement. They have three children Violet, Dash, and Jack. They live in a quaint suburban home. Over the years, Bob (or Mr. Incredible)becomes very restless and one night goes out to relieve his glory days as a superhero with his friend Frozone. What Bob doesn't know he is being watched by a mysterious stranger named Mirage who eventually recruits him to perform a secret mission (which leads to a series of secret missions).I have to admit I was a bit wary of this film. I thought Pixar couldn't outdo ""Finding Nemo"" (one of my top five favorite Pixar films) but the company did with ""The Incredibles"". The writing was excellent. I especially liked how they captured the teen angst that Violet was going through. What girl didn't go through that insecure stage that Violet experienced in the film? The animation was nothing short of amazing. Pixar continues to impress me with their use of computer graphics with every film they churn out.As far as animated films goes, Pixar has managed to outclass their rival Dreamworks with the excellent storywriting and impressive use of CGI.

You can tell that such care and master craftmanship went into the production of The Incredibles.  Wonder voice overs are provided by Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson. The film is about retire superheroes who have adjusted to their humdrum life and having to reluctantly (and not so reluctantly) come out of retirement and do the superhero thing all over again.  If you are an adult, this film will turn you into a kid again.  Between Dreamworks (for Shrek and Shrek2) and Pixtar (Finding Nemo, Toy Story and The Incredibles), it is now safe to take your whole family to the movies again.  For your hard earned dollars I can't think of a better film to spend your money on then this one.  So go see it for yourself.  Take your kids, take your nieces and nephews, your grandkids, your grandparents and perhaps the family dog and go see a movie that is all of that AND a bag of chips (in this case popcorn).	5.0	Pixtar ups the Ante WAY WAY UP in the sky	2004-11-05	2	1	1

Why don't they put something more creative? (Ok, The special powers is quite good) I think other Pixar's DVD is much more better than this.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A26113AWK9B7Y9	F0X H0UND	Lets start by getting this out of the way - I love animated movies. Be it a computer animated movie, claymation, hand drawn, it doesn't matter. If the characters are interesting, and the story is good, you caught my attention. On that note, I used to also sell home theater systems and blu-ray/dvd movies as a full time job with Best Buy, so I know the graphical & sound quality differences between blu-rays and dvds..With that being said, The Incredibles (in my opinion) is the best blu-ray movie released to date & would be the easiest way to convert DVD watchers to blu-rays.First of all its the perfect blend of comedy & action. Everything from Bob (aka: Mr. Incredible) saving people from the burning building or fighting the robot, to the the comedic mishaps of Dash & Violet. The movie was superbly directed, the voice acting is outstanding, the story is captivating, and quite honestly, you just need to watch it to get the full picture.With that being said, the blu-ray version of this movie is - again - outstanding. There are so many little details (like the family's strands of hair for example) that are enhanced with the abilities of blu-ray, and there are so many different vibrant colors that will simply jump off of your screen. If you own a half-way decent home theater system, the uncompressed audio of this BD disc will make you feel immersed in the movie.I bought this movie the day it came out, and I still strongly recommend anyone to buy it. It is honestly a jaw-dropping masterpiece by Pixar & Disney, and well worth every. single. penny.	5.0	worth every penny..	2011-07-18	5	4	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3JD8FDS3CO3GH	FairiesWearBoots8272	The genre of family-oriented computer animated feature film, invented and pioneered by Pixar Animation Studios, has seen a great decline in the past couple of years. Now, every other movie studio churns out another one in hopes of being the next Toy Story or Finding Nemo. In this reviewer's opinion, the formula has gotten incredibly stale. It's the same thing over and over again - Lots of humor and silliness for the kids, with some clever pop-culture references for adults, lots of talking inanimate objects voiced by recognizable and popular celebrities, a song by a bankable pop star. Wrap it all up in a bright, shiny package and advertise it on Nickelodeon and network TV and you've got a recipe for success. This formula has now been repeated ad nauseam by the movie studios yet parents, in lieu of more intelligent and creative children's entertainment, snatch it up. Just look at the crop of upcoming CG family movies slated for 2005. There are at least four, maybe five.However, if there is anything that you can depend on in the dreary world of computer animated movies, it is the name Pixar. Those five letters are quite simply synonymous with quality. They started the genre and still no one does it better. From Toy Story to Monsters, Inc. to Finding Nemo, Pixar has consistently produced astonishingly high quality films in both entertainment and artistic value. Pixar's latest, The Incredibles was written and directed by Brad Bird who gave us the wonderful 1999 film The Iron Giant. It is yet another staggering success for Pixar Animation Studios.The Incredibles is not just another fine computer animated movie, it completely reinvents and transcends its tired genre. The film boasts extremely sharp writing and plotting (rewarded with a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award nomination), excellent voice acting, extraordinary conceptual design and, most importantly, the audacity to break from the mold and do something different. This is first hinted at by the film's rating; The Incredibles is Pixar's first PG-rated movie. It is not just an assortment of jokes and pop-culture references, it is a fully-realized story focusing on human (sort of) characters and the struggle of living in a society that you don't fit in with. There are no talking fish, no talking bugs, no talking toys. It's a real movie with real heart told with extraordinary skill and style. It was well-deserving of its Best Animated Feature Academy Award, however the fact that its only competition was Shrek 2 and Shark Tale diminishes that achievement. Yes, it's also an incredibly fun story about superheroes with lots of stunts, action, giant robots, superpowers and an evil villain. I found it to be one of the most satisfying, and best, movies of 2004.Don't be deterred by the fact that it's computer animated and that it's from the makers of Finding Nemo. You don't have to be a child or a parent (I myself am neither) to love this film. It's a great movie that anyone can love and appreciate.	5.0	The Incredibles Restored My Faith in Animated Films	2005-02-28	237	209	28

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A17TDMFBT77CZJ	fastbr3ak 008	"Pixar has been producing top-quality animated features for a decade and counting now, and, come on Disney, you know you'd be in a craphole by now if it weren't for Pixar's creative effort.  ""Toy Story"" began the computer animated movement with a bang back in 1995, and its coronation needed no explanation.  However, its throne was toppled film after film: ""A Bug's Life"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monsters, Inc."".  ""Finding Nemo"" was a pleasant surprise, and Ellen DeGeneres always gives me a chuckle, but it was a little too kiddy-friendly for my tastes.  Part of what makes Pixar's movies so great is that they're crafted to appeal to just about everyone.  They got the physical comedy and the cute visuals for the kid in diapers and the smart sarcasm for the guy who sits in a cubicle, sips his coffee, and watches Homestar Runner on his computer when the boss isn't looking.  I didn't see a lot of that from ""Nemo"", but it's still head and shoulders above everything else that tries to pass for family entertainment today (""Inspector Gadget"", anyone?).  Well, I'm happy to say that Pixar has sealed its place in my moviegoing heart as the premiere animating team of the 21st century after seeing this here picture.  Hopefully, y'all will feel the same way.  ""The Incredibles"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Pixar, you've really outdone yourselves once again.  Besides providing an insightful message on nuclear family togetherness and delivering an incredibly (pun intended) sharp script chock full of satire and inspired pop culture references, ""The Incredibles"" is an action movie of the best kind, rivaling a few of the sequences in, dare I say it, ""Spider-Man 2"", also one of my favorites from 2004.  The plot centers around Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson from the shows ""The District"" and ""Coach), the superhero with unlimited strength of the fictional city of Metroville.  The opening sequence plays like an old documentary film, as he and his superhero pals are sat down and are asked to go down-to-earth by an off-camera interviewer.  It's a very clever scene, and gives the film that nostalgic retro feel.  It's also a technological breakthrough.  It's amazing to see how director Brad Bird pulled off incorporating the static from the documentary camera and enabling it to fit with the all-animated environment.  Anywho, Mr. Incredible works with cool-as-ice hero Lucius Best, aka Frozone (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) and super-flexible and super-hot Helen Parr, aka Elastigirl (voiced by Holly Hunter), whom Bob later marries.  Everything is going great, saving the day and all that good stuff, gettin' married and everything, until Mr. Incredible saves a guy who didn't want to be saved, and accidentally causes some excessive damage to Metroville's monorail.  This throws the supers' careers in jeopardy, and everyone protests against them.  The government is forced to have them all go undercover.  Fifteen years later, life is hard for Bob and Helen.  Bob is flabby and unhappily working at an insurance company and going through a midlife crisis, doing surreptitious vigilante work with Lucius on their Bowling Nights. Helen is a housewife and takes care of their three children: superfast 10-year-old Dash (voiced by Spencer Fox from some commercials or something) and shy junior high student Violet (voiced querulously by Sarah Vowell from ""This American Life"" on NPR).  She can turn invisible and make force fields.  And I can't forget their baby Jack Jack, who has no powers of which the family knows about.  Anyway, Bob is called back into action by a mysterious woman and everything gets crazy after that point.  Brad Bird, who also voices the hilarious fashion designer for the supers Edna Mode, did a fantastic job on this movie.  I can safely say the same thing for his other masterpiece ""The Iron Giant"".  Bird, who also worked as a creative consultant on ""The Simpsons"" in its glory days as well as ""King of the Hill"", knows how to do animated movies.  To him, animation is not a genre, and it shows.  While there are plenty of things to keep the kids (and adults) happy (the exciting action, the slapstick of Mr. Incredible), I think Bird intended to reach a teen/adult audience with the sharp script, the clever observations of teenage angst and suburban life, the midlife crisis, and the pop culture references.  While the characters look cartoonish, their behavior is not.  The characters are in realistic situations and are given 3-dimensional depth by the great script and cast to make their problems seem all the more believable.  These are the elements that Bird gave to ""The Simpsons Seasons 1-8"", ""KoTH Seasons 1&2"", and ""Giant"" that made them household names.  Don't get me wrong, I love zany cartoons just as much as the next guy, but to take cartoon characters and make them believable, even more so than a lot of live-action movies, breaks new ground for animation.  I've never seen a Holly Hunter movie before (I'm a 16-year-old guy, come on now), but I look forward to see more of her movies because she can really act, on or off-camera it seems.  Michael Giacchino provides the musical score.  This young, raw talent also composed music for the supercool WWII games ""Medal of Honor"" and ""Call of Duty"", as well as the TV Show ""Alias"".  The Bond-inspired, ANALOG-recorded score is brilliant and Giacchino, like Bird, is a sensational talent that everyone should look out for.  I guess Hollywood isn't completely out of ideas after all.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	"Few things in the world of DVDs are more predictable than making-of featurettes. Pixar, the 3-D animation outfit that loves to think different, does so in the making-of content for ""The Incredibles."" Energetic, visually adventurous and surprisingly edgy, the half-hour docu directed by Rick Butler distills the story behind the hit film about a family of undercover superheroes -- and unmasks the offbeat gang at Pixar that made it happen.Listen in: ""Businessmen hate the film business"" because they're gambling, not making widgets, producer John Walker says. Writer-director Brad Bird, an outsider, was ""a strong cup of coffee"" to deal with, one Pixar staffer reports with a nervous laugh. Bird says he was brought into Pixar because it really needed to be ""shaken up a bit"" -- and the Randy Newman music really had to go. Budget-minder Walker complains, ""Whoever thought of making movies this way is out of his mind."" Downright subversive by making-of standards.The docu is backed by an unusual ""more making-of"" section that tops 40 minutes, with chapters allowing viewers to pursue their interests, such as story development, lighting, sets or music.That's just the tip of Frozone's iceberg on the double-disc DVD of ""The Incredibles.""  Most of the content is worthwhile and non-repetitive. With the double commentaries mixed in, fans could kill a day taking in the extras. Or just a fulfilling half hour with the making-of.The Oscar-winning CG feature looks sensational in its pure digital-domain visuals. The letterboxed images set at an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 keep the action tight (avoid the full-screen version). The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound boasts EX encoding and has plenty of punch, but as is typical with Disney-related DVDs, the rear soundstage feels a bit underused.One must-see extra is the lengthy black-and-white animatic of Bird's original opening, considerably darker than the finished intro. Like other bits in the movie, it feels like Sean Connery-era 007.The docu crew caught Bird and producer Walker testily doing battle over finances and creative priorities, but they'd made up by the time their commentary was recorded, just before the film was released. The men speculate about reaction to ""The Incredibles,"" but, c'mon, they knew it was in the bag.A second group commentary with animators digs deep into animation theory and CG processes. Some of the illustrators Bird brought with him reflect on making the transition from traditional (""2-D"") work to 3-D. The commentary menu contains an animated Easter egg, as do most of the other menus (wait out the music; watch for little creatures).Other winning extras include a DVD-exclusive short featuring the cute-but-creepy baby and his panicked babysitter; the theatrical toon ""Boundin' "" with a fun talk from its folksy creator; a handful of segments on the way-cool retro score and its old-school recording process (actual musicians playing live, without computers!); and a faux-dated TV cartoon featuring Mr. Incredible and Frozone, who do a commentary but can't believe how stupid the episode is. Feel free to skip the character sit-downs with TV interviewers and the grating live short featuring the young woman who voices Violet Parr."	4.0	Spend a day with 'The Incredibles'	2005-03-28	5	4	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2ZWQIXVJDZGR3	Flyer Fan	When I finished watching The Incredibles with my 3 1/2 year old son and my father-in-law, the first thing that came to mind was that this had to have been the first animated movie that Disney attached it's name to in some way, shape or form that did NOT have a song in it.  THANK GOODNESS.  Trying to make The Incredibles fit into the normal family oriented animated film would not have worked, because it provides entertainment without the need for a) the smart-aleck sidekick, b) a musical tie-in, or c) the need to play cutesy with anyone.  By contrast, my oldest daughter received Mulan on DVD for Christmas, and having watched the film, I thought it paled in comparison to The Incredibles.  The two films are simply not in the same league.The basic plot has been covered by others here, but my thinking on the film is that it has a lot of the original James Bond films in them; the island/exotic feel of Dr. No, and some of the chase/escape scenes from From Russia With Love, for example.  The Femme Fatale of The Incredibles owes a lot to Pusse Galore from Goldfinger.  If you want to peg it, I've taken to describing the film as The Fantastic Four Meet Dr. No.The fact that as an adult I can connect with the film on many levels makes for an enjoyable experience, but the Pixar team has to be given a lot of kudos here as well.  Pixar does a great job with finding the right voices, the right direction, and crafting a smart story that doesn't talk down to the audience.For all the suspense, The Incredibles earned it's PG rating.  I'd say that kids 6 and up will have no problems with the film at all, and for some younger kids it's probably smarter to gauge how they can handle scary themes in movies (the scene in which the jet is under missile attack comes to mind) before letting them see the movie.  My son got scared once, and I told him to shut his eyes and it will pass, and he felt much better.  Even so, I was grateful he didn't get any nightmares that night, because for the 3 year old set, this can be simply too much movie.	5.0	Smart and Funny for both Kids and Adults	2004-12-29	5	4	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ACVNA57PI4DLV	Francois Tremblay	"Wow ! What an incredible animation movie from Pixar. It is just full of wit, superb settings and animation, an eye for detail, and works at all levels. Most of the humour in The Incredibles lampoons the ""superhero"" concept and how it would translate in real life, with the constraints of daily life, aging, social interactions, and so on. It also sends up spy movies almost as extensively. There is a sequence where Mr. Incredible distracts guards by throwing a giant rock at one of them, which is just precious.If there is one thing wrong with The Incredibles, you could say it is the ideological underpinning. Basically, the movie takes a positive attitude towards the idea that the Incredibles are ""special people"" and that trying to reproduce their powers through technology and giving them to the masses is evil. It's hard not to make an analogy with gun control and elitism of the worst kind, much like what has been leveled against Star Wars from some quarters.In the end, though, it becomes pretty irrelevant in the top-notch and inspired visuals, the jokes that almost always strike true, and just the wealth of ideas in there. Everything rings true. The only movie comparable to it is The Iron Giant, made by the same director. Now if only we could get more animation like this..."	5.0	Pixar has out-done itself !	2005-06-28	6	3	3

I had been looking forward to this for weeks, because earlier on I had read on the Internet that ""this movie was going to be a fun one"". Boy, that was a gross understatement. What an awesome movie. A two-hour rollercoaster rock'n roll funride that completely overwhelmed us both. Pixar, you are getting better each and every time. My family and me all watched and love A Bug's Life, Toy Story 1 & 2, Monsters Inc. and Finding Nemo. We own and treasure the DVD-versions of these movies. They are all kept at very close range to the DVD-player and the widescreen TV. We rerun them often. They rank well above all other animated movies we've seen, even the traditional but excellent Disney movies. But this one tops it all. How Pixar is going to surpass this one with their next movie is beyond me. And surpass it they will, trust me, because they've been doing this over the years with every new flick they produced. The sites, scenery, backgrounds, vehicles, costumes, panoramas, shooting angles are all highly original. All the characters of ""The Incredibles"" are, as always, phantastic, original, and well-developed. They stand out in your memory. I can recommend this supermovie to everybody, kids and adults alike. As far as I'm concerned, this movie deserves an Oscar nomination. Judging the movie by its artistic quality and pure entertainment value, I truly feel it matches well with academy award winning real-life movies that we've seen over the last couple of years. Way to go, Pixar. I may even return to the theater to see it a second time.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A32GGXUECOZFRC	"frfubar8 ""joe reader"""	Pixar's 'The Incredibles' is beautiful to look at.  It features the studio's signature attention to detail, character design and truly spectacular CGI animation.  It immerses the viewer completely into the world of the supers and is worth renting for that experience alone.CGI offerings from Dreamworks & other studios can look just as beautiful, but they lack the defining sense of heart and story quality that is Pixar's unique trademark.  This is the reason we care about a little clownfish finding his way back home, a monster who has a heart of gold or a cowboy doll who learns what real friendship is all about.We laugh at the antics of the CGI ogre & his donkey, but we fall in love with the performances that Pixar's characters give us in stories that remind us of ourselves as much as entertain us.  Having said that however, I have to admit that 'The Incredibles' missed the mark with me.  It was flooded with so much heart & love that what would have been a great story was drowned in a vat of maudlin sacchrinity.  The same story could have been told better with only 2 kids *one with powers & one without* or 1 kid with no powers.Rent it & enjoy the sights & sounds of a Pixar production, but save your money to BUY Toy Story I & II, Monsters Inc. & Finding Nemo.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AG8K92N37MT27	Garnet	I absolutely loved &#34;The Incredibles&#34; and it stands up to watching again and again.  The &#34;Toy Story&#34; animated movies happen to be my favorites ever (so far), but &#34;The Incredibles comes in a close second.  The animation is fabulous, the characters and their voices are perfect and the movie appeals to everyone from kids to adults.Some spoilers below:Mr Incredible is one super-powerful guy, but he has been forced to hide his super strength under a rock as he and his wife and kids are in a relocation program (all the &#34;supers&#34; have been forced to go underground due to lawsuits).  He is now living in the 'burbs, driving a tiny car, and forced to sit in a cubicle day after day watching his waistline go and pushing papers in a big insurance company.  He pines for the glory days of old when he could actually help people.Then he gets roped into working for an unknown boss right after he gets fired...he hides this from his wife (former superhero, Elastigirl), who then thinks he must be having an affair due to his secrecy.  She goes after him and the kids tag along and soon they are in a battle for their lives with the budding bad guy, Syndrome.There are some scary moments, some heartbreaking ones, but this movie is generally a good one for most ages.  The trials of raising kids with superpowers who display the same sibling issues as anyone else is brought out, as well as potential marriage issues...which makes the movie grown-up enough to appeal to adults.  Yet, there is plenty of action that kids will enjoy.  The movie pretty much keeps trucking along at a quick pace and is never boring.  The love of this family who come together to save lives, and each other, is wonderful to watch.Highly highly recommended!	5.0	One of the Best!	2014-01-29	0	0	0

Jackson and all the cast members deliver their voices with enthusiasm and get into their character!

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1FAKZ848PO3V8	GLENN WHELAN	"When the Parr family sits down for dinner a disruption occurs. Like a regular family meal, the kids are fighting, the baby is yelling and the mother cannot get any support from the father who is busy in the other room. Of course, a regular household would not have one child running around the table at sub-sonic speeds, a sister that has turned herself invisible, and a Mom whose elastic arms are practically stretched to the limits trying to retain order. But the Parr family is not ordinary. They are the ""Incredibles"", a family of Superheroes living in a world where Superheroes are no longer respected. That domestic family dinner scene encapsulates the brilliant charm of the film.When super strong Mister Incredible and the ever so flexible elastic-girl start a family, you know things can't be totally Ozzie and Harriet. In fact, their son Dashiell can run at super speeds, their daughter Violet can disappear at will and Baby Jack Jack... Well, nobody is quite sure about him yet. But when the superhuman community comes under fire from attorneys representing villains, all super suits are put away and heroes must now join the common man. But when the fate of the world is threatened, the family must work together to save us `normals'.Now, a bit about the story. It's been fifteen years since superheroes defended Metroville with their heroics. But some ambulance chasing lawyers and disgruntled people the heroes had saved, force the heroes into retirement. One time MR INCREDIBLE Bob Parr now lives a mundane life as an insurance agent. But he secretly yearns for the good old days - and his chance comes when he is approached by a agency to step back up. But when Mr. Incredible finds himself trapped, only his family will be able to save him!THE INCREDIBLES is the next wonderful film from PIXAR films, continuing a winning streak from TOY STORY, A BUG'S LIFE, TOY STORY 2, MONSTERS, INC. and FINDING NEMO. In other words, this studio is 6 for 6. But this is the first film of theirs with an all-human cast... Well, all-human of sorts.The casting is great. Craig T. Nelson (POLTERGEIST) and Holly Hunter (BROADCAST NEWS) are top drawer as the Parrs. Samuel Jackson (PULP FICTION) is hysterical as ""Frozone"". Jason Lee turns in the villainous performance, Syndrome.Writer Director Brad Bird (IRON GIANT) pays homage to many superhero films, but the Incredibles cleverly becomes more of a James Bond-esque Action Adventure. The animation is top-drawer and the musical score is a creative twist on the Bond Sound.The gorgeous DVD is loaded. Great video and sound. An entertaining running commentary as well as ""making of"" material for those interested in a look behind the magic. A funny ""Blooper"" reel and a short film called JACK-JACK ATTACK are sure to have you laughing. This is a great film and a great DVD. Out in theatres the same time as THE POLAR EXPRESS, The Incredibles proves to be more powerful than a locomotive. Awesome entertainment.""No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved! You know, for a little bit?

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3K0J9ZV3ZHAN3	G. Manino	"This is a story about what happens when individuals with special talents and abilities are cut down to size by the great mediocre masses.  It's a fantastically entertaining animated action film, but there's also a subtext about a sort of American ""Cultural Revolution,"" in which the gifted and talented are forced into menial servitude.  It also shows us why this is a bad idea.The ""super powers"" possessed by the Incredible family are just exaggerations of qualities that exist in ordinary families. The father has great strength, to protect his family; the mother (Elastigirl) is stretched in all directions by the kids; the young boy is full of high-velocity energy; the shy teenager can disappear, and build a wall around herself that (literally) nothing can penetrate, while babies are full of (scary) possibilities.  And Frozone's ice making super power is just an extension of his incredible cool.But the mistrustful mediocre hoards call upon the Forces of Evil (i.e., lawyers) to litigate the Supers out of existence, just because they happened to break a few eggs while saving the world.  Politicians get on the bandwagon and insist that ""...their secret identities should become their only identities.""  They're sent into the Superhero Relocation Program, and are forced to become ""ordinary.""Fifteen years of the non-Hero lifestyle take a toll on the Incredible family.  Mr. Incredible lives as insurance adjuster Bob Parr (par, in the sense of average), who bemoans the fact that ""... the world is constantly inventing new ways to celebrate mediocrity.""  Shy daughter (shrinking?) Violet is convinced that her special gifts make her ""abnormal.""  Dash wants to use his powers and actually be special.  ""Everyone's special,"" his mom tells him, to which Dash replies, ""That's just another way of saying no one is.""The villain Syndrome also wants to neutralize the Supers, but he takes the opposite approach.  He wants to trick people into thinking he's a real hero, and ultimately sell technology to the masses that will make everyone super.  ""When everyone's Super,"" says Syndrome, ""no one will be.""  As a boy he was Mr. Incredible's Biggest Fan, and used his budding technological skills to copy his Hero.  But Mr. Incredible's motivation was simply to help people in trouble, not to be adored by the masses.  One's motivation comes from the heart, and the other's comes from ego-driven self-interest.  Never the twain shall meet.The result of all this hero bashing is captured in a pretty chilling scene, in light of recent events.  A plane loaded with an intelligent but unfeeling robot is heading toward an American city skyline, with instructions to tear everything apart.  There's no one left in town to defend against it.  But in the end, the Incredible family combine their powers, becoming even stronger as a team than they were individually.  Disaster is averted.  The citizenry seem pleased to have them back, but whether they can officially return is still ""up to the politicians.""The ""i"" on their costumes may stand for Incredible, but it's also the personal pronoun.  The special gifts of each individual must be nurtured and celebrated, not suppressed and minimized by the jealous and insecure.I have always been surprised by the quality of Pixar films, because they seem to be created by a committee.  How do you get so many people to work together so effectively, to ""plus"" every scene, to push themselves beyond the limit so consistently?In one of the special features on the DVD, director Brad Bird and the film's creative team are looking over the shoulder of a young animator, watching a computer screen.  The animator is showing them the scene he's been working on.  Brad and the others are impressed, and they whoop and applaud.  The young animator beams.  These films aren't created by a committee, they're created by a family.  That's how you accomplish incredible things, and that's what this movie is about."	5.0	Incredible Family Values	2005-05-31	7	6	1

The combination of director Brad Bird and Pixar have created a fun excursion into the world of superheroes, complete with relevant modern-day tribulations thrown in for good measure.  Every time other film production companies feel like they are catching up to Pixar, the renowned CG animators make a great leap forward with something like ""Incredibles"", leaving the competition in the dust again.""Incredibles"" is about superheroes who have lost their relevance in a world of lawsuits and spoiled wannabes.  Our heroes been forced into mundane lives of drudgery.  The two children have inferiority complexes because they cannot show their superpowers, and dad (Mr. Incredible) has to put up with a brainless, narrow minded boss at the insurance agency.  Mom (Elastigirl) spends her life ironing and dealing with dad's frustrations at not being able to assist the helpless!  Ah, but evil still lurks in the hearts of men!  A dastardly force is about to be unleashed from an uncharted island, and Mr. Incredible and his super family are their to save the world in the nick of time!The direct-to-digital transfer is a marvel to behold.  Even on my 10-year old Toshiba 36"" CRT, the picture simply leaped off the screen.  It is clear to see just how far the CG animation envelope has been pushed beyond even the impressive work Pixar did in ""Finding Nemo"".  In point of fact, what really separates Pixar from the pack is the quality of the storytelling in their films.  One really cares about the characters and the journey they go through to reach the climactic battle with the giant robot at the end of the film.  There is real emotion here, things that anyone from 4 to 104 can relate to.5 big stars for Pixar hitting the nail on the head again with ""The Incredibles""!"	5.0	Tremendous Fun!	2005-03-19	1	1	0

Toy Story is still my ultimate favorite cg film.The movie was very long- much longer than it had to be.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3H399QDVP9FGY	Gryphon Osiris	"Plus a whole lot of ""cool"" tossed in for good measure.The Incredibles takes the classic elements of the comic book ""good vs evil"" story and adds wry humor, dashing swagger, cool bravado and a jazzy soundtrack that would be well suited for a Sean Connery Bond film. By style alone Brad Bird has obviously been worshiping at the altar of the golden age of super heroes for many years now (not to mention Bond films), and brought the elements that make them all great together while avoiding the camp that normally finds it's way into these types of films. Just when you think that they have pulled out all the stops Pixar finds a new way to keep you on the edge of your seat in the brillantly paced and rendered action sequences. The ""100 Mile Dash"" sequence alone is worth the price of the DVD, and actually resulted in the whole theater I was in to erupt into cheers on opening day.The film plays out as cleverly as a spy fiction, as fun as a family film, and as awe inspiring as the original release of Star Wars, with a hip brassy style all its own.MusicThe score is an impressive bit of retro swanky jazz that gives the film that 60's era feel. The composer, Micheal Giachinno, who has been known for doing television and video game scores captures the throaty brass themes used in 60's era film scores perfectly while keeping the tone fast and fun. Even more impressively instead of using the modern multi-channel recording system to mix the individual parts together he recorded all the musicians at once with a single microphone to give it the classic feel.The result, in a word, is Incredible. Brings back the swagger and bravado of heroes of yester-year while bringing new elements forth to make a style that is unique to itself."	5.0	Everything you loved about comic books...	2006-12-29	3	2	1

Swift ""97jedi"""	"The Incredibles is a great movie, showing the results of lawsuits driving superheroes into hiding and seclusion, forcing them to live normal lives.  But a non-powered individual's desire to become a superhero after being rejected in his attempts to become a sidekick becomes something of a megamaniacal villain, armed with technological terrors.  It falls to a few of the remaining heroes to come out of hiding (including their children) to defeat the villain's machinations and save the day.The special features are OK, the best part being the ""voice recording"" of Universal Man in the Top Secret section of disc 2.  I laughed like crazy, but to tell you why would ruin the surprise.  The one thing I would have liked in this one would be the faux outtakes that many other Pixar movies have used, but we get only some technical goofs in the special features (similar to those in the Shrek DVD).  There is a lot of production special footage that I actually liked, but non-tech geeks might not appreciate it as much as I did."	4.0	A really great movie	2005-03-25	3	2	1

We found that it's too dark and zany to watch with very young kids and the new ending spoils the experience for them. I don't understand that they didn't at least include the original ending as well so that you could choose which version to watch.Still the best Pixar movie.

Well, I totaly agree with him. Another said that ""This is a movie that has just about everything: great script, great animation and editing, awesome cast, and even a great soundtrack!"".

It's not worth your money.This movie is about a family of superheroes who aren't allowed to be superheroes. Yeah, it really is that bad.The family scenes show reality at its lowest- somewhere between realistic and fall-asleep boring, I would put it at the fall-asleep boring sections.There are about 3 good scenes in this movie and they aren't that long.The characters tend to speak in monotonous tones, especially Helen, which makes this movie easy to tune out.During action scenes, characters move fast! All their superpowers are in being exceptionally strong or fast or stretchy- no mind or brain powers.This DVD's only redeeming quality is ""Jack-Jack Attack,"" a short 4 minute sequence that is HILARIOUS and not included except on the 2-disc special edition."	2.0	Too Fast Paced	2006-02-23	11	1	10

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi"""	"AN ANIMATED FAMILY OF X-MEN -- COMPLETE WITH SPANDEX & IT ALL TURNS OUT PRETTY - - WELL - - INCREDIBLE:Pixar and Disney have made six exceptional films together, but I find myself reaching for this one almost every time.Needless to say, superhero films are no longer novelties, yet this film seems to have new angles on seemingly cliched themes. The lawsuits that put the ""Supers"" out of business is certainly a real gem and it gives Brad Bird who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"" some unexplored avenues to try, which he does and it turned out, well - - PRETTY INCREDIBLE!WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT:First we have the husband and wife superhero team that never has a chance to team up as ""Supers"" and instead turns into Mr. & Mrs. Average American after the lawsuits that ended the ""Supers"" crime fighting dynasty. Along the way they had three very different yet ""Super"" offspring! Wow, that's enough right there to keep us busy.We also have sub-plots which include each one of the 3 children's coming of age in a ""Super"" way, but as ordinary kids. The kids, like their parents, struggle all the way through the film to get to where they go and they grow in the process individually and as a family.We have Bob Parr [Mr. Incredible] going through what appears to be a mid-life crisis, and his confused wife, Helen, who just wants them all to fit in like everybody else. But, after all, how can ""Elastigirl"" be just another soccer mom? We have the return of a hostile and dysfunctional former fan [Buddy] who turns ""The Incredibles"" lives upside-down and inside-out. For the first time, the ""Supers"" are the underdogs!EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS - SATISFYING FAMILY ISSUES & MUCH MORE:After these elements are set into motion, we have EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS, and it is fascinating to see all the Incredibles' family issues worked out like any other family's, but with many interesting twists. ""The Incredibles"" is a SUPER film!DVD FEATURES: Anamorphic Widescreen 2.39:1 [very widescreen] Digital to Digital Transfer is the sharpest I have seen yet!Lots of features and deleted scenes as well as some early concepts for different ways of introducing the characters make me grateful they made it the way they did.The ""Jack-Jack Attack"" is probably the high point of the features and illustrates what we did not see going on between ""Jack-Jack"" and the baby-sitter. I just wish it was longer. The behind the scenes ""Featurettes"" are worth watching as are the blooper scenes, though they seem a bit contrived.There are two commentary tracks, one with Brad Bird [writer/director] and John Walker [producer]. and another with the animators. I could not watch the entire movie with either track on. Maybe you can. The files about the ""Supers"" are interesting. There is lots more. If you like to go in for it, you can spend the day with the features alone.For me, however, there is the film. This is the best animated film, in my opinion, and is perfect for all members of the family (of all ages) to connect with in a fun-filled, family sort of way."	5.0	AN ANIMATED FAMILY OF X-MEN -- COMPLETE WITH SPANDEX	2005-12-14	1	1	0

It's a perect family film and grownups and children alike will love it. The story is about superheroes that are forced to live normal lives by the government. (Without using their powers) Mr. Incredible is now fat, and depressed and is married ot Elasticgirl and they have three children. But, MR. Incredible wants back in the game and wants to be able to fight crime once again. So when a mysterious offer shows up, he tries to lose weight and take it. The movie itself is very funny with some very well made images and characters. If you want to watch a movie with the whole family, this is in my opinion your best bet.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AKN1DWVHBXMHA	Hot One	OK, here's my take. This movie is not only great for the kids, it's a great guys' movie, featuring eternal subplots. This is the story of Bob Parr - boy, when he was young he had it all: respect, lots of muscles, a cool car, and the freedom to do whatever he wanted. But now, Bob is middle-aged, overweight and balding, and trapped in both an unfulfilling, dead-end job and a boring marriage that provides no inspiration. (And you should see the jalopy he's driving!) And then out of the blue comes a beautiful woman who brings the promise of bringing back those lost days. Does he fall for it? You bet he does!And then things begin to go wrong. This isn't the old days; things begin to go wrong and he gets into the danger of totally losing his family. Now he begins to realize that his family is the most important thing to him. Can Bob regain his family, and find the freedom and excitement he wants in conjunction with them? Tune in and find out!Yep, as a middle-aged man I can tell you that this story really had a lot to say to me. In a day and age when men are usually presented as dysfunctional and incompetent, this movie instead painted a picture of a man who is flawed, and yet competent and large-hearted, as many men see themselves. I loved this movie, and enjoy watching it as much as my kids do! Buy this movie for your kids, but watch it yourself, it's great!	5.0	My take	2005-04-06	7	5	2

This being a PG movie I cannot understand why this is so.The dubbing in this movie SUCKS. Superheroes need to sound like superheroes, not like some dumb Sunday morning show from Univisi&oacute;n.  I don't care what the target audience for this movie was, I haven't talked to one person who liked it.The reason why the dubbing sounds like some cheap TV comedy is because those are the same guys doing the ""star-talent"" voices!!! Disney needs to get away from using those guys in dubbing their movies and get back to professional dubbing.Mexico used to take pride in doing great dubbing of Disney films; even some characters are more popular in Mexico than in their ""native"" countries because of the dubbing, but what happened to the Incredibles (one of the best movies in several years) just cannot be justified.Even Victor Trujillo, who is a known TV star and did a good job in dubbing Mr. Incredible declared at the premiere that he disliked how the dubbing had turned out saying that ""in this days anyone calls himself a voice artist"". Trujillo was a known professional voice artist before becoming a known TV star.Finally, the guys that did worse (if that can be said) are the guys writing the spanish script. Translating ""There's no school like old school"" into ""There's no school like antique school"" just cannot be forgiven; and there are several foobars of that caliber throughout the movie.So again, do some market research on your target audience or at least have some spanish-speaking folks in your staff watch the movie before showing it because this time dubbing really killed your excellent movie.Five star movie, 0 stars for dubbing: 2.5 starsIgnacio"	3.0	Urgent message to Disney/Pixar from a fan in Mexico	2004-12-27	40	24	16

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2YXGASP5UCTGQ	Ilze Bars	To understand why there are lousy reviews for this film, you have to read a few of them.  For one thing, anyone that has chronic spelling problems may not be suited to review a movie with a sense of humor.  Some of the material might be a little too much for their intellects.  For another, the complaints that this isn't exactly a children's film come from the reviewers that must have missed the fact that it is rated PG not G.  Big difference, don't you think?  Finally, I would like these same boors to name me one 'wholesome' Disney picture that did NOT contain any frightening images.  From the evil queen in the first Disney classic asking the huntsman to bring back Snow White's heart in a box, to Nemo and Marlin barely escaping their respective undersea terrors there are scary life lessons in all Disney films.  Nothing my children had seen prepared them for the horrors they saw on the news on September 11th.  This stuff pales by comparison.  For the record, I am replacing my children's copy of The Incredibles as it is scratched from wear.	5.0	REALLY read the lousy reviews...	2007-07-23	1	1	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1YRV8ICHSL41F	"Inchoatus.com ""Inchoatus.com"""	"With The Incredibles Pixar has created what is arguably one of the greatest family films ever.  It has a broad appeal to every member of the family without being pithy.  Dads in the audience may identify with Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, who traded in his cape, youthful vigor and life of daring adventures for a pleasant house in the suburbs, wife, children and a desultory job at an insurance company.  He now has to deal with a life of regrets and missed opportunities of glory.  Once, he was the nation's hero, now he is the family provider whose only opportunity for ""glory"" is to please his boss, a petty tyrant with an obvious Napoleon complex, by cheating little old ladies out of their insurance settlements.  Even the name ""Parr"" is a pun on the word ""par"" meaning ""average, normal, standard"", must be a constant reminder that he must suppress his super gifts.  We feel his despair with every defeated sigh and the realization that he is well into middle age.  His once Olympian physique lost to the ravages of a sedentary cubicle-dwelling, couch-potato life-style.  He is Howard Roark consigned to building nothing but boxy, warehouse-style discount mega-stores.Mom, like most women, seems resigned to her fate.  However, she must try to balance her domestic duties while avoiding the temptation to use her super powers to make doing the housework easier.  Imagine Samantha from Bewitched attempting to avoid the Argus-like gaze of nosy neighbor Mrs. Kravitz and you get some idea of her challenges.The kids fare no better as they try to hide their amazing abilities from their classmates and teachers.  Their talents have no place in an institutionalized society of conformity.  Poor Dash desperately wants to be on the track team just like his classmates, but his super abilities preclude him from joining.  So like most ""gifted"" children he copes in the most predictable way;  he acts disruptively in class and drives his teacher insane with his antics.  We suppose it never occurred to the teacher to try and inspire Dash to channel his remarkable gifts towards more productive activities.  Alas, the teacher prefers the old fashioned method of smashing the enormous square peg into the tiny round hole.  Many parents of gifted children will immediately identify with the struggles of the Parr family.As if the adroit social commentary on the degrading effects of mediocrity were not enough, the special effects and hellzapoppin', whiz-bang, super hero adventures would make the movie on their own.  Super-evil villain, Syndrome, lives on a high tech island that would make Bill Gates drool and Dr. Evil cry petulantly.  This is one, cool place.  Monorails, secret rocket launching pads, mindless incompetent minions, Syndrome has the whole package.  And he isn't just your run-of-the-mill, megalomaniacal villain cut in the Ernst Blofeld cloth.  He is the absolute embodiment of two of the most destructive forces in the universe--cynicism and envy.In the final analysis, The Incredibles is an action flick with a message that avoids being preachy.  Lesser directors have pummeled us with the clumsy way they present THE BIG MESSAGE until we nearly yell ""OK, we get it already!  I will trade in my SUV and get a hybrid!  Can we just get back to the explosions, please!""  But not here.  We get our lesson served up with a delicate, yet still profound, touch.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"	5.0	By God, this might be the perfect family film!	2004-11-10	2	2	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3USRUCHAOC3MT	"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff"""	"""Things exploding, people hugging.""  That's what composer Michael Ciacchino said the score was about for ""The Incredibles"".  Director Brad Bird echoed that, saying it was aimed at being a balance of the mundane and the fantastic.  It did a fantastic job at that.This was the first Pixar picture I watched, and I can see why people rave about their animation.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story.  I will admit that I found it interesting the similarity between the foursome and the Fantastic Four (one stretches, one is super-strong, and one is invisible with force fields in both quartets).  I also think it stretched reality a little -- I can imagine the son of a superman type inheriting super-speed, but there is no explanation why a super strong parent and an elastic parent could produce a daughter who turns invisible and throws force fields.  Likewise, if superheroes were out-lawed, what could keep evil supers from running wild?  But when did facts stand in the way of a good story?The story was very entertaining.  It dealt with adult themes in a way that children wouldn't be bored or question something inappropriate.  The writing was great to show human people who just happened to have powers.  It made a great jab at bureauracy being no better than criminals.Also, I enjoyed the James Bond-ish music.  The characters were great as well.Spoiler alert!!!  The rest of this review may ruin some surprises -- read at your own risk!  Also, some of this is my opinion of life in general.The villain, Syndrome, when he was younger, had wanted to be the sidekick for Mr. Incredible, who told him to get lost, that he could handle things on his own.  So Syndrome's plan was to sell superpowers to everyone, and commented ""When everybody is super, nobody is super.""  Actually, that is the reality.  In a sense, each of us are super, so nobody is better than anyone else.  (My thoughts here.)There is a theme that we are not meant to go about it alone.  If Mr. Incredible has decided to work with ""Indrediboy"", maybe there would never have been a Syndrome.  In the end, Mr. Incredible learned he was meant to be part of a team, and that team was his family.  We need to realize that this is true of us as well.The alternate beginning drove home the family point.  I think they did the better opening, but I wish they were able to do as the alternate beginning did, and have Helen tell some career woman who looked down on home mothers  the fact that one is no less important than the other.I enjoyed the extra features.  I would have moved the Incrediblunders up on the menu, because a lot of them were shown in the making of the Incredibles.  I was disappointed there was little shown about the voice-actors.  I did find the ""essay"" by Sarah Vowell (who provided the voice for Violet) intersting, since Vowell and I share interest in the Garfield and McKinley administrations, though I think she would benefit from Toastmasters."	5.0	"""Things Exploding, People Hugging"""	2007-07-11	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1NJLH4H82S1CV	"I. Stanley ""MotleyHoople"""	"The Incredibles is a terrific and entertaining movie. I loved it so much when I saw it in the theatre that I knew immediately I'd be buying it on DVD. And sure enough, when the film came out on DVD some months later I did purchase it the same week it became available. So now here we are six or seven years later, and no surprise that they are releasing The Incredibles as a blu ray disk title. And that's fine, I would have no issue with re-purchasing the film again on blu ray for the improved picture and audio quality. But why should I have to purchase it yet again on DVD, or for that matter why should I be forced to take a digital copy of the film that I also have no use for? This has become a huge scam with blu ray titles, packaging a DVD copy with the blu ray disk so that the consumer is forced to buy both, whether you want a DVD copy or not. Obviously we're buying the film on blu ray because we have blu ray players and want the improved picture and sound quality that blu ray disks offer, and that standard DVD can't provide. If we wanted the movie on standard DVD we'd BUY the movie on standard DVD rather than blu ray! And it's not like they're *giving* us the extra copy on DVD. While it might be marginally cheaper than buying an additional copy on DVD, you can bet that the price on these multi disk blu ray/DVD/digital copy releases is more expensive than it would be if they sold the blu ray disk on it's own, or as a 2-disk blu ray set with the extras on the second blu ray disk. Scamming the public... double-dipping...whatever you want to call it, they're basically saying ""If you want this movie on blu ray then you're gonna have to buy it again on DVD as well, take it or leave it!"" And you know what? As good a film as he Incredibles is, I think this is the one where I'll put my foot down and say 'No thanks'. And you know what else? If more people would do the same then they might just have to re-think this sleezy method of piggy-backing DVD's on blu ray releases to boost their DVD sales!"	1.0	Wonderful movie, but tired of the blu ray - DVD combo pack rip-offs!	2011-04-05	145	55	90

Jus compared toi the other Pixar movies its not as good.  This is also the movie that has Disney wondering if Pixar is out of ideas and gives them the question should we resign these guys.It is a great family movie and the animation is great as Pixar has done so well.

Ever since their first movie ""Toy Story"", Pixar has taken America by storm with each new movie they come out with. Their newest one, ""The Incredibles"" is no different.A family of superheroes have been forced to live life as normally as possible due to the public demanding the ""Golden Age of Superheroes"" to come to an end. Bob, the main character of the story, is a married and father of two man who needs to find some satisfaction in his life. Forced into hiding, he if offered that chance and from there the movie takes off.While the movie is not Pixar's best work out of their selection of movies, it certainly does hold a candle among the movies that will be remembered for years to come. Pixar has proved time and time again they can do great work and this proves it. I can't wait to see how your ""Cars"" comes out!! Keep it up Pixar!!"	5.0	Pixar Has Done It Again	2005-03-22	1	1	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A21XG7UVD2ABKS	Jack R. Tallent	"""The Incredibles"" is a spectacular masterpiece that could win, straight up, Best Picture of 2004. Not best *animated* feature, but best picture, period.Everything Pixar has done so far has been gold, and ""The Incredibles"" just raises the ante further. Like its predecessors, ""The Incredibles"" employes Pixar's much-vaunted CGI in the service of a good artistic vision. This time, the marriage of the technique and the art is so perfect, so synergistic, that the result is breathtaking.This movie just nails everything- CGI: perfect (check out the hair and fabric); production design: inspired (the houses, cars, everthing); choreography: amazing; site gags: guffaw-inducing. It goes on and on.I could cite hundreds of little things that illustrate the greatness of this film; the meticulous attention to detail that illustrates a true love of the work. One that springs to mind is a sequence where Elastigirl is stuck in multiple elevator doors while fighting a number of henchmen. While watching the scene, one can't help thinking how the creators of this film didn't HAVE to go through this effort. And yet, they created a small, almost incidental sequence worthy of Buster Keaton--a mini-masterpiece within the larger masterpiece.The list continues: Arch-villian: great; minor characters down to the baby sitter: wonderful; super hero jokes: very funny; Samuel L. Jackson character: great without being TOO ""Samuel L. Jacksony"" (if you know what I mean.)History will be very generous to ""The Incredibles"". It will be in all the  ""Greatest Movie"" lists, up there with the Star Warses and Lawrences of Arabia. See this movie."	5.0	A Breathtaking Classic. Pixar's Magnum Opus	2004-12-30	3	2	1

I know this movie won Oscars but I hope they can sleep at night knowing their characters are completely unoriginal. I would have liked it if they had actual unique powers but this makes it too easy to compare:Mr. Incredible: Super strengthThe Thing: Super strengthElastigirl: Can stretch to great lengthsMr. Fantastic: Can stretch to great lengthsViolet: Creates force fields and goes invisibleInvisible Woman: Can go invisible and create force fieldsDash: Record breaking speedThe Human Torch: Record breaking SpeedJack-Jack: turns himself into a fireball, goes invisible,The Human Torch: Turns himself into a fireballThe Invisible Woman: turns herself invisibleSyndrome: Can't take rejection, wants revengeDr. Doom: Can't take rejection, wants revengeI am not bashing this movie because the story lines do have some major differences and both movies are nice but I just wish Disney Pixar would have shown some more originality.

This element is lacking in a lot of other superhero films. I'm a huge fan of Monsters Inc. and didn't think any Pixar film could surpass it. This may have done just that.

However, on Disc 2....there are some Easter Eggs, so here's how to get them. When you go to almost any given part of the menus, wait about five to ten seconds for an Omnidroid to appear in the top right hand corner. It's only available for a few seconds, so highlight it quickly. With different menu screens, there are quite a few eggs on here....including a ""back-up"" version of ""The Incredibles"" done with nothing but sock puppets.  Check them all out and enjoy!ADDITIONAL INFO: For those who want to see the sock puppet version of ""The Incredibles"", do this: On disc two, go to the Index menu, then click on ""SETUP"". If you've done it right, it should give language options for ""Boundin"".  On this screen, the Omnidroid will appear as described before, except it will take about thirty seconds for it to appear.  Be quick to highlight and click on it before it disappears! Then watch the entire movie summed up with a very cheap, but hilarious sock puppet show.

I surrendered to it's animated three-dimensionalglory and couldn't believe the movie was over two hours! It was engrossing, yea, even awe-inspiring.However, in the spirit of full disclosure, I will admit I don't have a television and moving images on a screen tends to seize my attention, but I'm still fussy as hell about what I watch. But the word on the playground (re: my daughters and their friends) is that the movie sucks. I don't know about kids today (I do know they watch alot of cartoons/music videos/play video games) but they must be jaded beyond my fathomings to not like a masterpiece as The Incredibles. Jaded and over-exposed.What is it going to take to entain the ""Y"" generation nowadays. It must make the folks at Pixar coo-coo for Coco Puffs when the absolte pinacle of their artistic acheivement accrues such mixed reviews. What are they gonna do now? Stand on their heads and spit wooden nickles?I think maybe they should slam on the brakes and go against the technology trend. Reduce the polish and production and do an epic 3 hour ascii movie or something equally canonic. A black and white ascii movie might be a counter-commercial hit... but then again I can't see Pixar doing something so financially/creatively risky. But I digress.Me, I'm happy as heck about The Incredibles. My eight year old daughter and I had a blast (my 12 year old daughter wasn't interested... can you believe that?!).

The writer Brad Bird did an excellent job toying with the superhero and disfunctional family archetypes, and tosses in some terrific social commentary as well.  ""Everybody's special, honey""  ""Which is another way of saying no one is"".  This film lambasts moral relativism, trial lawyers, bottom-line insurance brokers, and even takes a dig at FRANCE!Kids should love the action scenes, as would parents.  Elastigirl has one of the best superpower scenes on film (the ""doors"" sequence, you'll know when you see it).  This truly does transcend age-boundaries, as it has better brains than 90% of the R rated flicks out there.  I've heard some parents voice concern over the action (""these men want to kill you""), and the implied ""relations"" between Mom and Dad (""get busy"" reference), but it's pro-family and wholesome.Few films are able to both satirize yet embody the best conventions of a genre, like this one does with superheroes--it teases the margins in a creative way (the superhero costume designer), AND it promotes the moral virtues that superhero flicks are supposed to.  A near flawless film that inspires joy, makes you wish you had superpowers.  One of the most poignant moments of the film is when Dash runs across the water, he looks down and starts giggling.

Even though this film was, by far, the most family oriented of the 3D animation craze.  Finding Nemo was about a father and son, Monsters Inc was about two single guys who find a lost child, but this one is about mom and dad and brother and sister who learn to work through there family issues without being too sickening, really, really good.  I confess to buying a pirated version of this in Bangkok, but I swear I will buy the real thing once it is out, I always do.  Most of all pay attention to the music, they do not go with any MTV rock and roll, instead they use that classic James Bond horn music that is so badly needed in these days of techno computer nonsense.  The writing is perfect as is the directing, this is by far my favorite 3D film, even beating out Shrek 2 (but just barely), not only the best animated film of the year but perhaps the best film period.  Can't wait to get it again ( I lost my bootleg...I suspect customs have it..or terrorists).

As stated in several reviews, the animation is terrific - to really appreciate it, it should be watched on as high a resolution screen as possible...the better the resolution, the greater the depth...watching it on a standard television doesn't seem to do it justice...I didn't notice in any of the previous reviews that any credit given to the soundtrack - the music really stands out in this film - reminiscent of the James Bond series of films...it's not overwhelming, even in the action sequences - really seems to help mesh out the rest of the film...Story telling in this film is very good, again, geared toward an older audience..plot moves along nicely, and seems well thought out, though I felt the ending was somewhat weak.Kudos to Sarah Vowell...I've always been a fan of her books and commentary on NPR, and having her voice Violet was fun...my 9 year old daughter now has a new role model, and I couldn't be happier..she's looking forward to seeing her during her book tours...The special features were adequate for this film - there was a lot of focus on the making of, but then when you see all the hurdles they jumped through, it gives you a greater appreciation for it....I do find reading the negative review rather humorous, particularly the ones who complain about the animation and writing..."	4.0	Overall, a very good film	2005-03-27	1	1	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ	"Jeff Edwards ""RadioJeff"""	I'm not quite sure what I expected when I walked into the theater to see 'The Incredibles' last year, but as the film ended, I realized a couple of major things:  First, this film was NOT geared towards my 2 year old (which made enjoying the film a difficult task at best) because the storyline was simply intellectually above him...and Second, this film ROCKED!FINALLY a digitally animated movie that actually gave a great story without aiming directly towards the little children so much, AND provided the audience with the absolute BEST animation to date.  I can't remember HOW many times I found myself thinking: Man, that looks like ACTUAL scenery!  The characters look like they could jump off the screen...and the hair!  As you enjoy this WONDERFUL 2 disc dvd you get to see a great deal of behind the scenes of the making of 'The Incredibles' and just what a challenge realistic looking hair was to the films progress, Violets hair in particular.  The entire film is a gigantic exclamation point to those who truly LOVE the entire process of creativity.  There is SO much of it in this movie I hardly know where to begin.  From the storyboards to how many outfit changes the characters make, even how to become a seamstress, computer-style.  Is it possible to make clothing patterns look different on the big screen?  It was a good question, and the Director went the extra mile and MADE it happen all in the name of making not just a good movie, but a GREAT movie.The fact that 'The Incredibles' took home the Oscar for best Animated Film was no surprise, even though it was up against 2004's biggest money-maker, 'Shrek 2'.  Sure, it may not have been as FUNNY, but what it lacked in laughs, it MORE than made up with technical creativity and a dang-good storyline.  I can't think of anything I didn't enjoy in this movie.  The voices were absolutely PERFECT.  Can you think of anyone, ANYONE better than Craig T. Nelson to voice Mr. Incredible?  How 'bout the director himself voicing Edna, the fantastic Super Hero Costume Creator?  It all came into place on the big screen, and now on my TV as well.  The extra's are great, maybe a little tedius after about 45 minutes, but worthwhile overall.  I would have liked more of the fake Outtakes like they added to the end of A Bugs Life and Toy Story 2, but I'll settle for whatever they could give me.  Oh, and I almost forgot the added extra of 'Jack Jack Attack'.  Please be advised it is only about 4 minutes long, and it basically gives you the idea of exactly what happened to the babysitter as she is frantically attempting to query the Mom for help on the phone as Jack Jack goes ballistic throughout the house waiting for the Evil Syndrome who prepares to kidnap him away from his parents.  It was funny and as always, VERY creative and also, it ended all-too-soon...just like the movie.  If EVER PIXAR decided to make a sequel, it should be to this movie.  Sure A Bugs Life 2 would be fun, even though Monsters Inc 2 would better, but right now I can't think of a single one I'd rather see than more about the life of these Super Heroes.  Visually just as fun as the storyline, 'The Incredibles' is definitely worth adding to your collection.  Forget renting, this one is flat out worth buying.  Kudos to Director Brad Bird and PIXAR for yet ANOTHER animation triumph!  Here's to continued success in the future.	5.0	Just about the best digitally animated film ever produced...	2005-03-18	2	2	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3BUFAGPDKONX1	Jeff Howard	Surprisingly, this movie seemed to be more for adults than kids.  Many of the themes were adult oriented and would surely fly over the heads of the elementary school crowd.  In the theater where I watched the children became restless while the adults were engrossed.  Unlike other Pixar offerings, there was not a lot of little stuff going on to keep the attention of the very young.After superheros are outlawed due to nusiance lawsuits filed by people who did not wish to be saved, Mr. Incredible becomes an insurance adjuster trying to save the world one policy at a time.  He married a former superheroine called Elastigirl and they had three kids who also have super powers.  They masquarade as a normal suburban family and deal with the problems relating to hiding their abilities.When Mr. Incredible is fired from his job for throwing his troll of a boss through a wall he is hired freelance by a mysterious man who wants him to test a new machine.  It is later revealed the scientist has been using the machine to kill of the old superheros so he can unleash his machine, fly in and save the day.Very clever story and animation, but the younger kids might find it boring.

I didn't see this picture in the movies when it was released. I rented with a mail order online store. This movie was awe inspiring from begining to end. From its throw back look and feel to its technologically fantastic special effects. It brought me back to a time when having a super hero on your wall in your room meant something. I was never a big fan of comic book hero's but I would have loved to see The Incredibles in comic book form back in my younger days. As a african american male I was deeply touched by the movie having an african american super hero. One that didn't die in the begining of the film but really had an impact to the whole story line. I also enjoyed the fact that it depicted flawed super hero's that were not perfect and made mistakes. They seemed so real to life and genuine in all the things that happened to them. I only own one other Pixar movie Finding Nemo but this one hands down is my ultimate favorite yet. I do hope Pixar continues in this series for I am looking forward to the Incredibles 2.	5.0	Could not stop watching it over and over again	2005-05-24	2	2	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y	Jeffrey A. Thompson	"What makes the movie stand out is the familial relationships. The movie is about an extraordinary family who truly love each other trying to survive in a very ordinary world that beats down on the extraordinary. The movie has many hilarious scenes, many touching scenes and many real scenes. My favorite ""real"" scene is when the Mr. Incredible drives home from work and stops the car. However, the car's engine does not stop. Having a car like that early in my marriage, I could relate to Mr. Incredible's frustration and despair far too well. The movie brings in the typical super hero stuff, but it has the feel of a Bond film and I think surpasses the genres of both films.The movie has a lot of extra features. The commentaries are excellent. Sarah Vowell (Violet) has a segment. She is an NPR commentator at large and author. Sarah is very strange and funny. There is a sock puppet version of the film. I don't know if that is an Easter egg or not, but it is funny.The movie is an excellent movie for the family.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	"Pixar animation has done it again!  Following in the footsteps of such classic animated films as ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Toy Story"", this fun-filled and action-packed film will be sure to captivate adults and children alike.Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Helen (Holly Hunter) are the former crime-fighters Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl.  Forced into retirement due to costly lawsuits and a slowly eroding base of support, they are placed in exile and must live the lives of ""normal"" people while forgoing their superpowers.  Their children Violet, Dash, and baby Jack-Jack have inherited their parent's powers; Violet has the ability to turn invisible and Dash has super speed.  Jack-Jack's powers aren't revealed until the end of the film.Bob takes a job as an insurance adjuster while Helen has set up housekeeping.  Longing to return to his superhero days, Bob is contacted by Mirage (Elizabeth Pena).  She has a top-secret assignment for him on a remote island, but when he arrives, he soon finds out that he has been tricked and lured in by Syndrome (Jason Lee), the former Incrediboy who idolozed Mr. Incredible but was shunned by him.  Bent on revenge, Syndrome has created a robot that has the capacity to learn on its own and Syndrome is threatening to unleash the robot on the unsuspecting city while he in turn destroys the robot himself, making himself look like a real superhero.Helen gets wind of Bob's mysterious journey to the island, and soon she, Violet, and Dash are on the island searching for Bob.  Will Syndrome succeed in his mission?  Will Bob, Helen, Dash, and Violet stop him before its too late?This is a spectacular film.  As with the other successful Pixar films in this genre, the animation is excellent, and the story is first rate.  Although there are some violent parts in this movie, it is still safe for kids to view as well as adults.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  It has quickly become our children's favorite film, and we've watched it together several times, and it keeps getting better with each viewing.  Watch this highly entertaining and exciting film from Pixar and enjoy some animated fun and action!"	5.0	An Incredible Movie	2005-05-11	3	2	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	With the superhero craze in full swing, Pixar and Disney (mostly Pixar) are capitalizing on the success with their own version of the Superhero universe.Following the adventures of Mr. Incredible, the movie introduces us to the heroes in their heyday, when the city loved them and counted on them, until an ungrateful `jumper' sues them.  Suddenly in a swing of political correctness, the heroes are all asked to step down and become `normal'.  They are forced to never reveal who they are what they can do, being dragged down in everyday existence.Mr. Incredible, voiced with great charisma and world weary exhaustion by Craig T. Nelson, watches his life get more frustrating by the day.  His desire for the old days is overly apparent as he continues to play the hero, helping old ladies find loopholes in policies enforced by his insurance company employer.  He feeds his overwhelming desire in nightly excursions with his buddy, Frozone (voiced by Samual L. Jackson) listening to Police and Fire bands in order to find people to rescue or criminals to catch.One day he receives a job offer that could put him back in the role of superhero.  In taking the job, things get crazy and whole new menace begins to unfold.  In order to keep this review short, I will say that this movie is more exciting and fun to watch then almost anything else that was released in 2004, with the exception of Spider-Man 2.  The Incredibles is awesome, not only utilizing elements of comic books, but bringing in the real life detriments that could come with that line of work.  Also, strangely noted, is the James Bond-like spy movie elements when Mr. I goes to the remote island for the job offer.Holly Hunter and Jason Lee round out the voice characterizations, giving great quality to the cast and making the movie full of life.  The Incredibles is great fun and highly recommended.  I can't wait for the DVD to be released.	5.0	Superheroes Rock!	2005-03-10	3	2	1

I was surprised to see how this movie received a PG rating with so many violent and mature scenes.There are numerouse death scenes in the movie of past Super Heros.There is a car chase, in which a criminal is firing a gun a cops.There is a scene in which there is drinking.And Finally, there is a scene in which a man is attempting suicide.  Yes, he is saved by Mr. Incredible.  But, the man comes back to state ""I didn't want to be Saved!""I personally thought it was a cute movie.  But, I am also an adult.  I am not sure how children would react to these types of scenes.  Many children probably wouldn't pick up on the suicidal scene or the drinking scene, but I know they can understand the death scenes and gun fire scenes.I just cannot figure out how this movie got a PG Rating, along with such rave reviews, when it has this type of violence in it!  I mean, when you look at the blow-ups in the past over Disney movies that supposedly showed other things happening in scenes, this movie is quite obvious in the violence and adult situations, and nothing was ever said.As I said before, I thought the movie was cute in different areas, especially the little boy waiting to see something amazing that finally gets to see something ""totally wicked.""But I have to deduct points for Disney/Pixar allowing this movie to go out without warning parents with small children that they may want to inspect the movie first"	3.0	When did suicide attempts become PG?!?	2005-04-23	15	1	14

For me this movie is, without ANY doubt, one of the greatest super-hero movies made to date. This film displays action sequences that are amazing, creative in execution, and as thrilling as they are beautiful. This film is a masterpiece. Toy Story and its sequel are excellent films and I thought that there was no way Pixar could possibly continue creating that level of greatness. While A Bugs Life wasn't one of my favorites, it's still a fantastic film. Monsters Inc. continued the Pixar tradition of making a better movie. It's simple, heartfelt, and provides a beautiful impression that their world will continue in a positive direction despite the end of the movie (something that kids, the target audience, need to know). ""Finding Nemo,"" like all other Pixar films, has a strong family message and it provides us with some beautiful visuals. Again, Pixar built upon its own accomplishments and provided us with a film that will be heralded as a classic and loved by future generations.

The animation is as impressive as I had expected it to be as a Pixar product. However, the levels of violence truly came as a shock to me. The scenes where the Incredibles modeled extreme violence as a suitable way for the ""good guys"" to deal with the ""bad guys"" were quite long, reappeared quite often, and really seemed to keep pounding the point into my 3 1/2 year old grandson that super-heroes are little more than well-intended ""good guys"" promoting ""kicking butt"" as being quite acceptable ways to deal with ""bad people.""Quite unsophisticated approach to a ""good guys"" vs. ""bad guys"" movie, particularly when the movie might quite easily be mistaken as being intended to be enjoyed by very young children. Though parenting opinions about fighting as a means to conflict resolution vary tremendously. I'd think the excessive focus upon fighting merits at least a warning to parents of children younger than 5 or so.

I didn't enjoy Finding Nemo a whole lot and walked into The Incredibles thinking that it would be just another kiddy/family film. Boy, was I wrong.There is some very strong characterization lended by all the voice actors. even though there is no swearing or any real hardcore violence, it still feels like a movie adults can enjoy. I think that this is one of the few films that people of all ages can enjoy because there are jokes that are thrown in for all ages.

From the mannerisms to the situations that make you say ""Hey that's my family"" you can see that the filmakers are genuine masters.The art direction and cinematography are top notch and in my opinion some of the best we saw in 2004.  The sound is just right, and every color jumps off the screen.  But none of this would even matter if the story was not as enthralling as it is, being able to achieve the right balance between comedy and drama.With a PG rating (a first for Pixar) the management was afraid that it had letting down its parents who enjoyed having an excuse to watch there movies by taking their children, I will say there are a few scary moments that are common through superhero flicks, but even during the darkest moments of the film their is usually comic relief or morals to be made.Looking gorgeous on your television, the storyline, Pixar's fantastic taste, bonus features, I could go on and on, The Incredibles was one of the few movies worth seeing last year, if you haven't seen it yet its worth buying, and if you have the movie is still worth picking up.All in all The Incredibles receives aBliss of 9"	5.0	Pixar Strikes Yet Again	2005-03-18	2	1	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1T4W38AC7EZTO	J. Glove	Ok, this movie is a blast, and maybe I'm biased because the four characters are so much like our family personality-wise (am excluding the baby) and even physically.  Edna is hilarious, and Frozone holds his own.  I really like how the movie pokes fun at the comic book genre at the same time that it celebrates it.  A fewl lines from the movie have become catchphrases in our house.  I think the Violet character is in many ways my favorite, I guess because she has a real transformation.  That sort of thing is of course much more involved in real life, but it gave the movie a little something extra.  The bonus is John Ratzenburger, but I won't say more.	5.0	No! - No Capes!	2014-06-18	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2GVJ83F092MIS	J. Hayes	"Staying consistent with the magic and quality of previous Pixar films in the past, The Incredibles delivers an amazing viewing experience for children and adults alike. The difference this time around is that the film concerns people in real-life, facing the kinds of situations that families do instead of funny toys, talking fish or monsters. Not that those movies weren't great achievements in their own right, but The Incredibles is one that most families can relate to. This movie will no doubt leave the children frozen to the tv screen but its not too cartoonish for adults to enjoy as well. After all, it is Pixar's first PG movie so you could expect it to be a little bit more mature. Pixar's movies to me posess the magic and entertainment factor that Disney movies used to and where Disney lacks, Pixar knows how to deliver an action-packed thrill ride everytime.Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, and Helen Parr, aka Elastigirl get married and are determined to balance married life with their duties as superheroes. But one day, the supers begin to be sued for their help. They become too big of a liability, so the government relocates them to normal lives, forbidden to do their work. Fifteen years pass, and The incredible family has grown to 5. Jack-Jack is the baby assumed to have no super powers. Dash is quicker than lightning, and Violet can disappear and produce force fields. At this point Bob Parr is bored with normal life because all he wants to do is protect the people but he isnt allowed to. One day something happens that draws Mr. Incredible back into the biggest mission of his life, as well as the rest of the Incredible family. That's all I will give away from the movie, but be ready for pretty much non-stop action until the end.This dvd set is worth the price. As with the other Pixar releases it is packed with extra features. This includes a blooper reel, several behind-the-scenes documentaries, concept art galleries, Jack-Jack Attack short which fills in on what went on in The Incredible house while the family was away, an interesting new short ""Boundin'"" by Brad Luckey, a wierd Mr. Incredible cartoon featuring Mr. Incredible and Frozone, an essay by Sarah Vowell (voice of Violet) and introductions by Brad Bird--director of this great movie. And also there are many deleted scenes. The picture looks great, the audio is available in English, French and Spanish 5.1 EX, and the extras are awesome.

Holmes	"Disney and Pixar have re-created the magic of ""Finding Nemo"" in this delightful family film.The Incredibles documents the efforts of a super-hero filled family to fit in and ""just be normal"".  When danger threatens, the family springs into action and saves the day while restoring their faith in each other.  The Incredibles is a heart-felt tale of family ties and of discovering the glory within those ties.The DVD is packed with extras, including a new animated short film title ""Jack Jack Attack"".  While Mom, Dad, Violet, and Dash are out saving the world, baby Jack Jack is left at home with an unsuspecting sitter.  When Jack Jack's superpowers begin to display themselves, the sitter is soon at her wits' end.  This short film is a great addition to the over story of The Incredibles.The Incredibles is a great family film, however, parents of small children should be aware of some violent themes such as a plane with children on board being attacked by missles.  Overall, the violence is pretty mild, but small children may be frightened by the targets of the violence also being children.

Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, Monter's Inc., Finding Nemo and now the Incredibles. This one I think might be the most fun though. It's also more worth buying or renting over recent live action super hero movies like Elektra and Catwomen. The action scenes look fantastic and the comedy is very well done as well. I love the part when it's explained to Mr. Incredible why  super heroes shouldn't wear capes. Then super heroes with capes are shown having horrible ""but funny"" accidents due to having capes.In a way though I found it to be like Spy Kids  with a family of super heroes instead of a family of spies. I mean two super heroes meet and retire and have kids. In Spy Kids, two spies meet and retire and have kids.... Even the bad guy's Island seems like it came straight from Spy Kids 2. The villain is annoying and makes you wish Mr. Incredible would just crush him already as well.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A4GPHAI2LRIQI	"JJD ""John"""	"In a land where AVENGERS rule the box office and superhero films paint the cinematic landscape year round, this little 2004 gem still stands out head and shoulders over many of them.If you took elements of Watchmen (the book, not the movie), Fantastic Four, and a dash of sixties spy movie cool...you'd have The Incredibles.The Parrs are a family like many of us. They deal with the frustration of a dead-end job, the often thankless work of keeping house, the social awkwardness of adolescence, and the sense of stiffled potential. However, unlike us, they have certain ""gifts"" that would make a mediocre existence that much more frustrating.This is where the real heart of the story lies...not in the ""crash bang wallop"" of the action scenes and derring do...but in the Parr's family dynamic itself. Naturally, a movie like this asks us all to suspend disbelief. That said, I also believe that Brad Bird's approach to the family situations hit the nail on the head with a very believable hammer. They are as real a family as anything I have ever seen on television or film before. I know exactly how Bob Parr feels when he climbs in that stuffy car and fights traffic to a job that he truly hates...but does so to put food on the table. It's worse when he knows he's capable of so much more. Helen Parr is the prototypical housewife and mom. She's the rock. She's the glue that keeps them all from falling apart...like many Mom's are. Violet has all the shy and awkward trappings of most 14 year old girls...knowing she's different, yet feeling like she's invisible even when she's not using her gifts. Dash...well...Dash is about as average a ten year old as they come. He's mischevious and WAY too eager to show all the kids what he can do. Who hasn't felt like that at some point in their youth??Add to this a great villain in Jason Lee's Syndrome. His motives aren't necessarily about world domination or wealth and power. They're actually a bit less insidious than that. He wants the approval and adoration that so many of us want in life....but his approach is what makes his character nefarious and twisted. He's yet another well fleshed out character.Samuel Jackson's Frozone is a fun character that I wish had more screentime, yet his contribution to the story is great as middle-aged Mr. Incredible's voice of reason. A loyal friend...but someone who isn't afraid to tell him that he takes things too far.Oh...and what else could be said about Edna Mode?? Ten minutes of total screen time...yet steals those ten minutes effortlessly.One of the things about this movie that really wows me is the way they were able to get such GREAT performances from completely CGI characters. The facial expressions, body language, emoting....all done perfectly. In many ways, better than many real life actors. I see Holly Hunter in Helen Parr more than any other voice performance, but I do see some elements of Craig T Nelson in Bob Parr as well.Brad Bird, responsible for one of the most underrated and excellent animated films in history (The Iron Giant), really hits it out of the park. This still remains my favorite Pixar offering...and one of my favorite movies of all time."	5.0	"One of the best ""superhero"" films of all time!!"	2012-05-15	0	0	0

They're all so awesome it's sometimes hard to tell which one is better than the other.  Like in a previous review i read, it is nice to get away from the toys and animals for once and deal with ""real"" people.  The Incredibles is definately Pixar's movie by far.  I maybe be going to far with this, but think it's actually better than Finding Nemo, although Nemo is a totally awesome movie and does run a pretty close second.  The animation in the movie is unbelieveable.  It beats its ""predecessors"" so-to-speak (Toy Story, Bug's Life, etc.) and a few other movies, too.  I love the plot, too.  Very orginial.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A11F0ECHMYDWIN	"joedriver252 ""joedriver252"""	"Simply put, ""The Incredibles"" is more engaging and entertaining than many of the live action superhero films of the last few years.  It's on the same level as the excellent ""Spiderman"" films, and it blows away the dreary and depressing ""Hulk"" (sorry to remind you of that one).  The animation is top notch, as we've come to expect from Pixar.  The writing is clever, with some gentle jabs at political correctness, ""mid-life crises"", and our society's lawsuit-happy nature.  The characters are as well developed as those in the best live action ""action films"", and the supporting characters (especially Edna Mode) are as engaging and memorable as the leads.  The film contains affectionate nods to everything from superhero and spy films to the Rankin-Bass holiday specials of about 30 years ago (does anyone else think Syndrome resembles a slimmed-down Heat Miser from ""The Year Without a Santa Claus""?).  The messages in the film about family and self-confidence are delivered with humor instead of sappy sentimentality.  All in all, a great film!In addition to an excellent movie, the DVD release contains a second disc crammed with extra features, and most are well worth watching.  ""Jak Jak Attack"" shows what was happening when the babysitter made her frantic phone calls.  It plays a little like a collection of ideas that didn't make the final cut (possibly because they would have spoiled a couple of plot twists), but its funny and clever.  ""Bounding"" is a clever story by Bud Luckey, who's evidently an underrated writer and animator. ""Bounding"" (or is it ""Boundin'"" - I forget) is about a sheep who learns where his true happiness lies, but again, instead of being sappy, it get the point across in a humorous manner - sort of like a laid-back Dr. Seuss tale.  The deleted scenes are show through storyboards - some show the wealth of ideas the creators of the film had, while others show their wisdom in deciding what to include and what to leave out.  This is an extras disc that's actually as worthwhile as the feature film, and it completes a package that's one of the best entertainment values to come along in quite a while."	5.0	Great Entertainment!	2005-03-19	5	4	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"A film by Brad BirdPixar's sixth animated feature is something of a departure for the company.  It marks the first time they have brought in outside talent to direct a feature (Brad Bird, director of ""The Iron Giant"").  It marks the first time a Pixar film has been rated PG instead of G.  It also is the first time a Pixar film is completely about human characters.  Previously the humans in Pixar movies have been kept in supporting roles with the most prominent one being Boo in ""Monsters Inc"".  This time around, the humans are everywhere, so this was a new test of Pixar's talent.  Time will tell, but ""The Incredibles"" may just be Pixar's best movie.Imagine a world where there are superheroes battling to save the day.  They fight because they have superpowers and this is their job.  Mr. Incredible (Craig T Nelson) is the best, and most famous, of all the superheroes.  But when he is sued for saving the life of a man who didn't want to be saved, the floodgates of lawsuits opened up and the country decided that there is no need to have any more superheroes.  All superheroes are placed into the ""Superhero Relocation Program"", are granted amnesty for their past deeds, and now work regular, normal jobs.  Mr. Incredible and his wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) are now simply Bob and Helen Parr.  They have two children, Violet (NPR's Sarah Vowell) and Dash (Spencer Fox) who have superpowers but are not permitted to use them in public.  Bob Parr works in insurance while Helen is a stay at home mother.  Their lives are mundane, but Bob cannot quite let go of the past.  He goes out on Wednesday nights for ""bowling night"".  But bowling night consists of him and his former superhero friend Frozone (Samuel L Jackson), think ""Iceman"", sitting in a parked car listening to the police scanner talking about the old days and waiting for a chance to illegally help someone.Bob Parr is contacted by Mirage (Elizabeth Pena), a superhero still doing superwork and she has a job for Mr. Incredible, if he is willing.  Dissatisfied with his life, Mr. Incredible comes out of retirement, but he doesn't tell his wife.  Suddenly he is making three times the money he was in insurance (before being fired from that job) and he has motivation to get back into shape.  Elastigirl suspects an affair, but it isn't long before Mr Incredible has disappeared, captured by super villain Syndrome (Jason Lee) who has had a long standing grudge with Mr. Incredible ever since he was a child.  Elastigirl, along with her children who secretly come along, have to rescue Mr. Incredible.This is a Pixar movie, so all of this is animated and since it is a Pixar movie, ""The Icredibles"" pushes the boundaries of what was thought possible in animation.  Simply put: this is a beautiful movie.  There is an exaggerated level of realism, but everything flows and moves perfectly.  This is, in part, a children's movie so ""The Incredibles"" is a lot of fun to watch.  There is fast paced action which will thrill the kids.  The movie is funny and flashy and bright.  At times it looks just like a Saturday morning cartoon, but if so, it is the best Saturday morning cartoon you are likely to ever see.  There is so much for adults in this movie to enjoy.  From the clever dialogue and discussion of superheroes and super-villains to jokes that will go over the head of children, ""The Incredibles"" has something for everyone.  There is action, comedy, adventure, fun, thrills, suspense, and danger.  The Pixar name (not to mention Brad Bird) has long been one for quality and Pixar does not disappoint with ""The Incredibles"".  This is easily one of the best movies of the year.-Joe Sherry"	5.0	More proof why Pixar is the best movie studio	2004-11-09	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AQBRMBQ99ESI7	"John A Lee III ""jal3"""	You gotta love the irony of it: all superheroes forced into retirement and hiding through fear of lawsuits and politicians. What a premise! It just keeps getting better.Pixar continues to set new standards in animation. Not only do they do a superlative job with their craft, they do a superlative job at entertaining as well. The Incredibles is another examples of this.After being forced into retirement through the abuses of the legal system, Mr. Incredible longs for the good old days when he was free to help people. Now, he is stuck in a 9 to 5 job with an insurance company which has a policy of only helping stockholders. It's enough to make a superhero weep. It does not help that he is married to Elastigirl and has kids with super powers. They too must hide their abilities and it all reminds him of what he has lost. Then he gets a secret call and sees the opportunity to go back into the hero business. The problem is that the call is really from a bad guy and having the family along just complicates matters. It does so with delicious fun.Many people think of animated films as being just for kids. That is a mistake. There is plenty here to keep kids amused but there is also plenty that will go right over their heads and amuse the older folks. Sorting out your marital problems while comating evil super villains is a tough job but that's why they have super heroes.Loads of fun for young and old, this one will appeal to anyone who is young at heart.	5.0	Incredibly Fun	2005-05-10	6	4	2

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A9TG2NFA614S9	John F. Rooney	"""The Incredibles"" (2004) is a computer animated Pixar film in which a group of Superheroes have been sued and become a financial burden to the government. Before that Mr. Incredible and his girlfriend Elastigirl had a great old time fighting crime and evildoers. They and their super-ilk are exiled and put into a Superhero protection program. The government officer who sends Mr. Incredible into obscurity looks like ex-President Richard Nixon.Later, after years of boring suburban life, Bob Carr, Mr. Incredible, is chafing to get back to work thwarting villains. He lives with his wife Elastigirl and three kids who also have superpowers that they have to keep hidden.Bob is a very real and believable. He's a superhero with a lot of human flaws. He's a klutz, none too bright, overweight, and he's a henpecked husband; wife Elastigirl is a nag. It's ordinary family life: their kid, Dash, gets sent to the principal's office for misbehavior involving his super speed.Bob serves as an insurance adjustor and has to put up with a nasty little boss. He's a husband who fears his boss and has a long-suffering wife. It's like an old-fashioned situation comedy where the father is a schlemiel Dagwood Bumstead type.The office cubicle scenes are very well-done. Bob favors the customers and eventually gets fired. The scene where the diminutive fashion designer makes him a new costume is funny and clever. He is lured back into service as a superguy fighting for humanity to stop a menacing force that is out for world destruction.When he was an active Superhero, Mr. Incredible had failed to encourage Buddy Pine, a Superhero-wannabe, who has now devolved into the evil super-villain mastermind Syndrone with superpowers of his own. He becomes Mr. Incredible's nemesis. Superheroes are being knocked off by Syndrone.It congeals into a James Bondish film (remember this is all animated cartoon stuff), an action flick where good guys are fighting the superbad guys on an island. The action sequences may thrill the kiddies, but parents will have to stifle yawns. ""Oh, this stuff again."" The film is overly long, and the tedious action sequences aren't highly original.The movie if full of satiric touches, but it's too drawn-out, and needs tighter editing."	4.0	The SuperHeroes Go Into A Protection Program	2009-12-14	5	1	4

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	"""The Incredibles"" is truly incredible, and yet, I would caution those who are thinking of bringing their young kids to see it. It is as violent as the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, with as much deadly action, though viewers are spared the necessity of seeing murder onscreen. The plot is also surprisingly quite mature, since it deals honestly with marital problems while still adhering closely to comic book sensibilities. I was surprised by the high quality of the writing, which deftly blended family situations found, for example, in the television situation comedy ""Malcolm in the Middle"" with the comic book action of either the ""Spiderman"" or ""X-Men"" films. Some of the writing is hilarious, especially when Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) and Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) are squabbling about their marriage while trying to stop a madman from launching a rocket containing his latest, deadliest robot.The story may seem a bit cliched, but it works well thanks not only to excellent writing, but also the acting done by the cast, lead by Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter, with excellent work too from Jason Lee (Syndrome) and Samuel L. Jackson. Mr. Incredible and his fellow superheroes find themselves unwanted by the U. S. government and are placed in a ""Witness Protection"" program, trying to live like normal Americans (think sometime in the late 1960's). Married to Elastigirl, he tries to lead a normal life as a clerk at a life insurance company, but fate soon intervenes and Mr. Incredible finds himself reliving his former superhero past at a potential price which may cost him the lives of himself and his family.Without question, this is among the finest animated feature films I have seen in recent memory. Pixar has created a near classic, thanks not only to its superb animation, but also the splendid writing, acting and excellent direction from Brad Bird, perhaps best known for his earlier animated film, ""The Iron Giant"". It is still a film I would recommend to the entire family, but you should be aware of the extensive violence depicted and prepare your young kids accordingly."	5.0	Astonishing Animation from Pixar	2004-11-24	1	1	0

I don't want another DVD copy, I don't want a digital copy.  From now on I refuse to buy any movie that has a DVD copy piggy-backed on it.  It's utterly rediculous!!!!  Why do you think I'm buying a blu-ray version of a movie?  It's not because I don't have a blu-ray player.  So, if I have a blu-ray player, why do I need a DVD copy of it also?

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A5I8OWSLWM1MF	John Michael Kain	Alright, I saw the previews for this movie and I thought, yeah right, but I did end up seeing it in theaters. I saw it again. then I rented it. If I had the money I'd buy it.Pixar Animation Studios does yet another great job with a brilliantly done animation, but also storyline. I is highly original, which is one thing that should be valued, especially in cartoon/animation pictures.The plot is strong, but I wouldn't be surprised if they came out with a sequel. There's room for this to grow even more.I do have to say that this was much better on the big screen though, simply because of the nature of the film. It's a kid's action animation. You need a larger screen. Still great though.I would strongly recommend this piece.	5.0	the incredibles are incredible!	2005-04-17	1	0	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A356HRZZFCEGL1	"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos"""	"***This review may contain spoilers.***For decades the predominant theme of the superhero universe is that possessing super powers is a stressful burden fraught with peril, lack of reward, and worst of all, an ungrateful public. The Marvel pantheon has promulgated that realistic but depressing notion through almost all its characters (notably the Hulk, Spiderman, the Thing, and especially the X-Men) to such a pervasive degree that DC Comics, home to the ""demigod"" Superman, had to follow suit. Superman, formerly invincible and infallible, suddenly became saddled with multiple vulnerabilities, inhibitions, and doubts. Again, this realistic approach is thought-provoking and an important factor in the success of the ""Spiderman"" movie franchise. But let's be honest; if you had a super power, ANY super power, wouldn't you have the time of your life?""The Incredibles"" answers this question with an exuberant ""yes!"". I will not dwell upon the movies many virtues, since other posters have already done a thorough job of that. I wish to emphasize that ""The Incredibles"" succeeds to a large degree by inverting the above-mentioned Marvel superhero theory, ""regressing"" back to the 50's and 60's and reminding us that, in the final analysis, being a superhero is freaking great. Bob Parr (aka. Mr. Incredible) revels in his abilities and his responsibility to humanity. Unlike with Spiderman, et. al., his powers are not a curse but an unadulterated blessing and his raison d'etre. Unlike Spiderman, et. al. he does not want to be a normal member of the herd, to be equal to them. He wants to be, and is, different, and better. That's why his speedster son Dash (a.k.a. Dashiel's) remark that ""when everyone is special, no one is"" resonates. Mr. Incredible was wasting away in Conformityville; to survive and keep his sanity, he had to put on the tights.""The Incredibles"" is thus not a scathing satire of superheroes, except for a few jabs at Mr. Incredible's spare tire, and Ms. Mode's hilarious montage on the dangerous absurdity of capes (for which archvillain Syndrome apparently did not get the memo). It treats superbeings with respect, and not just Mr. Incredible. As the movie unfolds, it progresses from a stately (perhaps slow) state of domesticity and family to a crescendo of Action with a capital A. Of course, ""The Incredibles"" does acknowledge and juxtapose super heroism with reality (at least the reality of tortuous lawsuits, oppressive ""Dilbertseque"" corporate workplaces, and the unpleasantness of adolescence through Dash and Violet). But the movie eventually and gloriously breaks free, and so do Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Dash, and Violet!The only ""flaw"" I could perceive in ""The Incredibles"" is its somewhat derivative nature and amalgamated blend of every superhero, James Bond, Spy Kids, and Powerpuff Girls conceit ever revealed. So what? Good for the movie! I eagerly await the family's next adventure and perhaps the obligatory ""origin stories"". I hope the sequels continue to keep the proceedings fun.A few random observations:1. Mr. Incredible has his foibles (his expanded gut, his initial neglect of his family, and his occasional Buzz Lightyearesque imperiousness), but he is no buffoon and no joke by any stretch of the imagination. His family is recognizably human but quite laudable.2. In an early scene in the movie, just before Mr. Incredible in his younger days confronts supervillain Bomb Voyage, the illumination hitting his old suit makes him look like Green Lantern.3. The Omnidroids Mr. Incredible and family battle resemble a cross between Dr. Octopus's tentacles and a bathysphere.4. Brad Bird must be a Fantastic Four fan!5. Evangelical Christians will probably be aghast at Baby Jack-Jack's climactic encounter with Syndrome (which got the loudest cheer from the theater audience I was involved in).6. Though spawned by frustrated geeky fan-boy aspirations, I thought Syndrome made a formidable and even occasionally sympathetic villain, channeling both the Joker and an evil Mask (as well as, ahem, Heat Miser of course).7. One cannot trademark a superpower.8. I wonder if Marvel will ever contract with Pixar to do a comic rendition of ""The Incredibles"".9. Apparently Mr. Incredible possesses strength in the ""Class 100"" range, easily able to bench over 100 tons. But does he possess other powers? He cannot fly under his own power, but is he invulnerable, have optic and auditory powers, etc.? What are the extent of his family's abilities?10. I'm glad the Parrs did not have a super-powered pooch or other pet a la Krypto, unless that comes up in the sequel.11. The PG rating is warranted. Pre-preteeners will find the movie by turns a bit too intense and slow-going, as the occasional infantile whines in my movie audience can attest to. Savvy adults and older teenagers will probably enjoy the movie the most!By the way, I bought the DVD."	4.0	With Great Power Comes Great Fun (Finally!)	2012-01-20	1	0	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AK81WLVD5KGUX	"John S. Ryan ""Scott Ryan"""	Well, Pixar has raised the bar again.I dragged my younger daughter to see this, and although she enjoyed it, I enjoyed it more. If you didn't grow up reading comic books, you'll think this one is much ado about nothing. But if you still have a box of Marvel comics stashed away somewhere ('in your heart' will do), you'll love this film. Kids will like it too, but don't mistake it for a 'children's film' just because it's animated and has superheroes in it.The eye-popping animation is Pixar's finest to date, and that's saying a lot. The voice characterizations are consistent and believable throughout as well, especially (but not only) Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson.The storyline is wildly, exuberantly inventive. There's lots of gentle spoofing of comic-book conventions, but it never descends into mockery; this film takes itself seriously, plays by its own rules, and delivers a surprisingly powerful story within those rules. Writer/director Brad Bird (of _Iron Giant_ fame) is obviously familiar with superhero comics in a way that only someone who loves them can be. (And the script passes the sternest test: it would have made a fine live-action movie too. In its way it's every bit as good as the _X-Men_ films.)The family's superpowers are, at a literal level, lifted directly from the comic-superhero world. But Bird puts them to sly metaphorical use as well, invoking well-known 'familial' archetypes: the super-strong dad, the pulled-every-which-way mom, the hyperkinetic little boy, the teenage daughter who turns invisible and isn't yet very good at putting up shields. Adults will enjoy this stuff if they notice it, but it's handled in such a way that everybody (including kids) will grok it intuitively whether they're consciously aware of it or not.The film doesn't moralize or preach, but its universe is one in which good and evil matter. To the extent that it has a moral, it's healthily individualistic and even anti-egalitarian; for example, the villain is motivated primarily by soul-deforming envy and resentment (and quite needlessly, since his own talents are clearly remarkable even though they're not superpowers). It shows genuine teamwork in action and doesn't confuse it with conformity or collectivism. It suggests very strongly that there's something wrong with refraining from displaying and using one's gifts just because not all other people share them. It illustrates that when heroes aren't permitted, the result is mediocrity.It may even stimulate older viewers to ask ourselves what _our_ special powers might be and whether _we've_ stopped exercising them (and if so, why); are we sure _our_ glory days are really over? Why, in short, did we put those comic books away? Have we forgotten why we liked them?You don't need me to tell you the plot; the other reviews have already done that. If you have an ounce of comicbookery in your soul, you'll love this grand, rollicking homage to the genre. See this one in the theater and _then_ buy it on DVD.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A33CLVW2K7SL1P	Jonathan Appleseed	Pixar lords over the realm of animation; they own it, and all others are pretenders to their throne.The characters aren't the most original: at best, they are archetypes (if comic books have been around long enough to have archetypes) of well established superheroes. Mr. Incredible is Batman without the dark side, Elastagirl is, interestingly enough, Mr. Fantastic from the Fantastic Four (a movie coming to our theaters in 2005). The older son is obviously the Flash, and the teenage girl is an amalgam of several characters, both comic and non-comic. But archetype does not mean stereotype. These characters are all freshly represented.For example, instead of having a dark side like his inspiration, Batman, Mr. Incredible has a self-doubting side. And he marries a superhero, creating a family. Another (mostly) unique representation.It would be easy to disect this film into even smaller parts, draw more parallels, but I think that would be doing the film a disservice. Sure, it had inspiration from other comics, but the way it was written, drawn, directed, voiced - everything - made it wholly its own. This is a movie that everyone will love (and the box office is evidencing that), from kids to adults.	5.0	Sequel, please!	2004-11-22	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AA3EC3LKOBD80	Jonathan Cohen	"If you thought those animation wizards at Pixar did a great job with dolls, ants, fish and one-eyed monsters, wait till you see what they do with humans! Here comes ""The Incredibles"", a fantastic mix of superheroes, vintage spy capers,spot-on family sitcoms, dry-witted satire, and a crackling-good adventure to boot. Animated characters? Fuhgeddaboudit. This beats the pants off most live-action superhero stuff.Energetic writer-director Brad Bird sends you into a unique world of space-age '60s nostalgia, James Bond-style undersea techno-villains, ""Mission: Impossible"" city chases- and that's just the action part. It's what he calls ""the mundane side"" that makes this so likable: the forcibly-retired Bob Parr (a/k/a Mr. Incredible) as a paunchy, bored insurance adjuster; long-armed Helen Parr (a/k/a Elastigirl) feeding her two squabbling kids and google-eyed baby; and other realistic family-life sequences. They may be ""supers"" but they're one of us as well.This is a two-hour movie- a bit long for animation, but it never flags. The detail and design are impressive, the mix of ""real life"" and super-fantasy perfect. There's also a generous amount of deadpan satire: I mean, Congress has to put superheroes out of business because of wrongful-injury lawsuits?Dave Barry couldn't have made that up.Voices include all-American dad Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible/Bob, Holly Hunter as Helen/Elastigirl, and super-cool Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone- the Ice Man. Don't miss haughty, dimunitive ""E""- Edna Mode, fashion diva to the stars and superheroes, voiced in clever Gabor-isms by...Brad Bird himself!Also, if you're a vintage soundtrack fan like me, check out the snappy, brassy ""secret-agent jazz"" score created by a gifted musical newcomer, Michael Giacchino (think John Barry, Lalo Schifrin, et al.) It's terrific and deserved an Oscar nomination on its own.This 2-disc box includes the movie and commentary on Disc 1 (including a THX adjustment, for all you film-school geeks) with the added bonus of being able to go right to the feature rather than sit through five trailers. On Disc 2, in addition to an hour's worth of well-done ""making-of"" material (the musical and sound-effects portions are particularly good), you'll find three mini-'toons: ""Jack-Jack Attack"", or how that google-eyed baby drove his sitter out of the house (very funny!),""Mr. Incredible and his Pals"", a mock ""lost '60s"" cartoon whose ultra-crude look (anyone out there remember ""Roger Ramjet""? Somebody at Pixar did!) and added in-character remarks by Nelson and Jackson are hilarious in themselves, and ""Boundin'"", part of the theatrical package and a soft, folksy update on old-time kiddie Westerns (created and narrated by Bud Luckey, Pixar's senior animator.)""The Incredibles"" not only won a much-deserved animation Oscar (plus a bonus sound-effects award), it's Pixar's best work to date- and that's from a house that's had nothing but mega-hits. I rented it the day it came out, spent the better part of two days enjoying it, and would buy it for future viewings because this is the rare family-friendly (or even adult!) movie that you could watch over and over and note something new every time. It's a caper, it's a techno-thriller, it's a super-adventure, it's a family comedy, it's nostalgia, it's a clever spoof, it's...""The Incredibles""! My highest recommendation!"	5.0	WOW!

The government finds them too costly to support in the wake of continued lawsuits and has set up a program to hide them from society.  Two such heroes are Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl who have gotten married and had kids.  But Mr. Incredible misses the old days and occasionally sneaks out with an old friend (Frozone) to right wrongs in secret.But then Mr. Incredible is contacted to help stop a powerful robot.  The action gives Mr. Incredible a new lease on his self worth and things begin to look up for him.  But eventually his exploits get him in trouble in a big way and his family gets involved.  First they are just trying to rescue him and then they need to rescue civilians in a plot similar to one used in Astro City.The story and action are excellent.  Combined with a powerful music score, the film often feels like the best of the James Bond films.  A great cross between the superhero story and the secret agent story this story really moves and has real character development.  Overall the film is less intense than Finding Nemo with fewer scary moments and surprisingly little violence.  The scenes of superheroes trying to be mundane are excellent.  A wonderful cast of voices completes the mix and creates a movie that is fun for most ages.I watched the short Jack Jack Attack before the main film and I think it works well that way.  Also included is a wonderful little film called Bounding that can be watches over and over again.  Some deleted scenes, interviews, character bios and other things round out this edition.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1LVZOK9F7K4CN	JR Pinto	"The Incredibles is one of the best superhero movies ever made.  Watching the surprisingly realistic computer animation, it raises the question, ""Why don't we make ALL our superhero movies this way?""  Let's face it, the special effects in ""live-action"" films are just as computer-generated as these.  Watch the way Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) creates an ice-slide.  Will Iceman (of the X-Men) ever be able to do something similar in a live-action film.  The whole look of the film is terrific - capturing the feel, the architecture, and the look of golden-era comic books.  Personally, I usually find computer-generated humans to be a bit creepy, but this film is successful because it eschews realism in favor or caricature for its characters.The story is as funny as any animated feature I've seen: superheroes are forced to retire and adjust to civilian life.  Of course, that can't last forever and The Incredibles come out of hiding.  The funniest character turns out to be a fashion designer who answers the question, ""Where do superheroes get their costumes from?""The film is much more grown-up than one would expect - especially about violence.  Elastigirl tells her children:  ""You know those cartoons you used to watch on Saturday morning?  This isn't like that.  These people won't show restraint just because you are children - they will kill you if they get the chance.""  It is because of the seriousness of some of the violence that this picture isn't suitable for the very little."	5.0	One of the best superhero movies ever made...	2004-11-10	0	0	0

Such characters as Edna will forever be remember.  I cannot remember the last time I thoroughly enjoy an action movie let alone a cartoon action movie.  Highly recommended for all ages.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A26VS586HEMGP5	"J. Thadeus Toad ""Cave Dweller"""	Technically speaking this is one of the finest of the modern crop of animated films and one of the best of the superhero genre, live actors or not. In the world as created by Pixar we are treated to amazing levels of visual detail, fluid motion, expert pacing and excellent scripting. This is a film that will entertain everyone in the family, as long as they are at least five years old. Believe it or not, some of the stuff in this excellent film may really be too intense for the youngest viewers. The voice work is absolutely exemplary, the dynamic soundtrack will test your home theater audio system and the secondary audio tracks are an excellent source of information and entertainment. The second disc has some nice additions, such as outtakes and a short feature, but it is the wonderfully imagined visual biographies of the heroes of the Incredible world combined with some very funny audio interviews with the featured heroes that stands out. The story is complex and I was never left with the impression that the superhero framework for this wonderful film is simply an attempt to ride the current wave of hero and comic based features. I most heartily recommend this film to even the most straight laced, purist cinema fans	5.0	Setting New Standards	2005-03-24	3	2	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"Imagine we lived in a world where superheroes actually existed. What would that world be like? It would probably be pretty nice. But what if something happened, an accident of some sort that was inadvertently caused by these same heroes that put many in jeopardy, and maybe even cost innocent lives. Would we shun these heroes who had saved our lives countless other times over one incident when fate didn't go our way? Well, that's probably what would happen given the state of our society, and is exactly what happens in Disney/Pixar's computer animated hit movie ""The Incredibles"".""The Incredibles"" is about a family of heroes who find themselves trying to fit into normal everyday life, after the government was forced to put them into a sort of witness protection program designed for those with extraordinary abilities. Bob Parr (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Helen (Holly Hunter) are doing their best to raise their anything but normal family and stay out of the media spotlight. Their oldest child Violet, is a somewhat depressed, introverted young girl who possesses the ability to become invisible, which she does whenever a cute boy is around. The middle child, Dash, is the exact opposite of his sister, as he is a hyperactive kid who definitely lives up to his name with his ability of super-speed. Then there's Jack-Jack, the baby, his power is to drool on everything and look cute. Living the life of a normal person doesn't set too well with Bob though, as he is constantly drawn to the glory days, when heroes were honored by the people and depended upon to right the wrongs. So when a mysterious offer is made that could give Bob the excuse he needs to use his powers again, he of course leaps at the opportunity, but what he soon discovers is that often times if the offer is too good to be true, then it probably is. Now, Bob finds himself in a fight for not only his life, but also that of his family and friends in the hidden superhero community.Just when I thought that Pixar couldn't possibly do any better than their classics, ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Toy Story"", those creative gurus go and deliver what is quite possibly their best film to date. Now, I'll admit I may be a bit more biased towards this movie since it is a superhero themed movie, a subject matter that I enjoy due to my interest in comic books and their movie adaptations, but aside from that I believe that this is a truly well put together piece of cinema that the entire family can sit back and enjoy on multiple levels. That's the glorious thing about Pixar films, is that they actually strive to contain a little something for everyone to enjoy. For instance, in this movie their is thrilling action sequences (for the action buffs), family drama (for the dramatic types), a little romance (for you mushy people out there), and of course, comedy (which is where the movie truly shines by having comedy that hits all sorts of age ranges).The story for ""The Incredibles"" is a perfect superhero tale that is so well-developed that it can easily go toe-to-toe with it's live action counterparts, even besting some of them. It was an interesting approach to take by having the world go from essentially worshiping these heroes to shunning them the instant things didn't go smoothly, to turning back around and needing them again. Even though it was an animated movie full of comedy and adventure, the story is actually one that would probably be fairly true to life if this was to all take place in the real world. Which shows the depth that the creative teams at Pixar are willing to take their movies to in order to achieve the most entertaining experience possible for audiences. One final note regarding the story for ""The Incredibles"" is that this is the type of storytelling that I wish Marvel and 20th Century Fox would have taken with their film ""Fantastic Four"". Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed that movie as well, as my review stated, but I would have preferred a little more serious tone in the film. Which is why ""The Incredibles"" was a little bit better of a movie, in my opinion.Another outstanding feature for most Pixar movies is their terrific vocal performances from all of their actors. A key component to making any successful animated movie is to have the best actors possible to bring these 2-D or 3-D characters to life. It's something that Disney has always strived for, and it's nice to see that Pixar is carrying on the tradition in order to continue making excellent family-friendly films. The voice actors gathered together for this film all turn in fun, engaging performances bringing each of their characters to life, in such a realistic way that balances perfectly with the beautifully rendered computer generated imagery. Which brings me to my final praise of the movie, the animation. As always the folks at Pixar deliver another awesome looking 3-D animated film that features CGI that rivals even the biggest live action blockbuster film.All of these factors combined together are the prime examples for why Pixar remains the best of the best in animated films of any kind, and their hit film ""The Incredibles"" is no exception.""The Incredibles"" is rated PG for violence."	5.0	Expect the Incredible...	2007-09-04	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1E1FGV9V1WQ6A	Justin Playfair	What more is there really to say after almost 300 other reviews? Probably not much, but I'll add my vote to make sure that the film gets the rating it deserves.What's interesting about this movie is how many pitfalls it managed to avoid that so many movies fall into. For example:1. Implausably strong female characters. It has become a cliche' in modern movies that the women are usually stronger and smarter than the men. This movie managed to include a very strong and intelligent female character without portraying the men as weak or stupid.2. Forced family drama. Although there wasn't anything particular new or different about the family drama in this movie, it was done in a way that didn't detract from the action or make it appear to have been added just to appeal to a certain segment of the audience.3. Glorifying bratty kids or otherwise annoying behavior. While the kids in this movie weren't angels, their bad behavior wasn't ignored or encouraged by their parents. What's more, the movie's creators resisted the temptation to throw in the obligatory annoying character, although the opportunity was certainly there, particularly with Jack-Jack.As you might have guessed from these comments, my opinion is that what really made the movie great is that it was just an outstanding and well-told story. Despite the fanciful setting (an animated movie about superheroes and villians), this comes across as one of the believable movies I've seen in a long time.	5.0	What more is there to say?	2005-03-19	2	2	0

It seems like they continue to set the bar higher and higher with each film.  I'm hoping their next film (Cars) can even surpass this one. :)The basic story is about Bob Parr, formerly known as Mr. Incredible.  After citizens started suing superheroes, they all had to go in to hiding and pretend to be ""normal"" people.  Fast forward fifteen years and a slightly pudgier Bob is working at a job he hates.  His wife, formerly known as Elastigirl, is a super mom of their three children - Violet (who has an invisibility power and the ability to make forcefields), Dash (has super speed), and a toddler named Jack Jack (seems to have no powers).Bob and his best friend, former superhero named Frozone, both miss the old days and when their wives think they are bowling, they're really listening to police scanners and helping keep the city safe.  Soon, Bob is contacted by a secret agency about coming back to the superhero life and helping them solve a crime.  Eventually this involves his entire family as they have to battle the villian, Syndrome.Typical of Pixar, the graphics in The Incredibles are amazing. Some of the landscapes looked so realistic it was hard to believe they were all created on a computer!  The dialogue was funny and witty as well, able to entertain children and adults alike.  It's not often you see an animated movie that both kids and adults can enjoy, but Pixar seems to hit the mark with all of their films!  This one is no exception.

All this while he has watched so many animation movies, including those from [...] but only Toy Story...and now The Incredibles, really captivate him.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2D9IEFJGB483Q	Kendal B. Hunter	"I was surprised at how many people saw movie TWICE within first week.  That is a rare tribute to any movie.I loved the story about normalizing heroes.  We have this flat Golden Age of Comics view of heroes of not having passions, hate and loves. This has been done successfully with the first two Batman movies, Daredevil, and most supernally in the Spider-Man movies. We need heroes that bleed.  It is a bit like Kierkegaard's comments in ""Either/Or"" about people in Shakespeare and the Old Testament actually having emotions.  These passions and flaws paradoxically makes them more useful a heroes. Anyone immaculately conceived really isn't alive.Furthermore, this film conveys a positive message about the Nuclear Family that hasn't been done so well since the ""Bionic Six"" cartoon series, and  ""Lost In Space"" TV series.  The 1998 movie failed because the writers/director did not understand that the only way the Robinsons survived in space was due to their healthy family.""The Incredibles"" carries on this tradition, and the final battle involves the whole family working as a team to defeat the enemy.However, I do have some reservations. . .SPOILER ALERT!The story was a bit uneven.  In some places it was rather tight, as with Mr.  Incredible interacts with and eventually creates Syndrome.  But it was loose in other areas.  These scenes seemed forced and contrived.  For example, Edna Mode (the funniest character in the Pixar catalogue) making all the suits,  the interactions with Syndrome, Mr. Incredible, and Sarah Vowell.The hardest scene involved involving the children. It is always the hardest, sicen no sane parent-even if they are a superhero-would involve their children in crime fighting. The children just appear on the ship. I know that Violet probably made them invisible, but  there was no lead up to the incident..Another squishy area was in characterization.Elastigirl is too stronger a character, and she overpowers Mr. Incredible.  This is seductive for writers, since it is easier to write, as in Kim Possible and Son Stoppable.  Also,  it panders to the soccer moms.Furthermore, she doesn't have a soul.  She is limited by circumstance and situation. As a superheroine, she is all guts and glory. As a mom, she is a grizzly bear. But in both cases, she players her role to the hilt, but is limited by the roles.  Pay attention to the opening interviews, and then the suburban lifestyle they lives. She just sucks in circumstance.Mr. Incredible, however, thinks beyond his roles.  In fact, he does the opposite-as a hero he wasn't his secret identity, and to settle down. As a father, he wasn't to go back.  He is indecisive, but he is thinking outside the present roles.(BTW, he was morally justified in rescuing the family out of the building, even though it was illegal)Mr. Incredible not heroic enough.  As a cubical monkey, he does small good things, and his moonlighting as a hero is almost like a college prank.  And it is his folly that drive the plot: creating Syndrome and betraying his family.  He is less like a hero, and more like a sad Greek who absentmindedly kills himself.This reminds of an idea brought up in ""Unbreakable"": Why do wives get in the way of men being heroes?Violet could have been stronger. As ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" shows, the invisible character can be the most colorful. And her hair!  She can't be naturally black.  I would just assume she is a goth, and then when she comes out of her shell, have go back to a natural blonde or red, like her parentsFrozone also seems a cookie-cutter character. He is unnecessary to the plot, and nothing hinges on him being in the story.  I think Jackson did  a good job with the voice, but he is not key.  Mr. I could moonlight without him, and nothing would be lost.I would redo scene where Mr. I grabs Ms. Vowell.  I would have him hear about his family dying, and then go into a rage and break out, and damage Syndrome in the process. This would be nice foreshadowing, and also establish Mr. Incredible as a tough brick.The three -pronged enduing was lumpy.  I would have stopped with the family defeating the balls, and not worry about Jack Jack Parr.  I get the joke with the name, but he was a unnecessary character to the overall plot, and was juts filler material for moms.  That is, unless he has a role to play in The Incredibles 2I think the films biggest flaw was that it looked too much like the Fantastic Four.  The lifts are obvious:Mr. Incredible=The Thing.Elastigirl=Mr. Fantastic.Violet =Invisible Girl (The force-field AND invisibility smack of copyright infringement).Jack Jack Parr=The Human Torch and Franklin Richards.In fact, all the visual gags with Elastigirl were old hat to anyone who has read four issues of the Fantastic Four or Plastic Man.  It looked good when executed, it was just predictable.The music, which was across between James Bond and Johnny Quest got annoying after a while.  It was too blaring and brassy, and way too Goldfinger. In fact , I felt like I was watching a cut-and-paste of ""Dr. No,"" ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" and ""You Only Live Twice.""  The music kept reminding me I had seen a island-base with spaceships several times before.The only reason why I am so critical of the Incredible is that I think it is a platonically beautiful idea.  We need more messages reinforcing the Nuclear Family, and each family being a hero.  I love the idea; I juts want it to be executed as best a s possible. The franchise is alive, and  I hope The Incredibles 2 succeeds."	4.0	I saw this film before-only in different pieces.	2004-11-13	7	3	4

It was very interesting to watch, and kept me entertained the whole way through. I have never been a big fan of superhero movies (Batman, Superman, Spiderman) but found this movie very enjoyable. Not only was it entertaining to watch, but also very funny. It had a very creative storyline, and I really did not expect as much as I got out of this film.The characters in this movie are played off very well. The main character, Mr. Incredible, voiced by Craig T. Nelson of Coach, is very good. His superhuman strength makes him the perfect superhero, and he is very fun to watch. His wife, Elastigirl, can stretch as far as the eye can see. This tandem makes for a very effective defense of the city, and they enjoy saving it every day.Soon, the public becomes sick of these ""supers"" and they must go into hiding. They have children, whom also have superpowers, and try and pretend to be a normal family. However none of them can stand possessing these awesome powers, and not being able to put them into use. That is where the real fun comes in.The Incredibles was very well put together. The combination of Pixar's amazing ability to create unbelievable movies, and Disney's creativity makes for a fantastic film. The entire Incredible family makes a great team, with all their super abilities, and it makes for one of the best movies out there in a long time."	5.0	FANTASTIC FILM	2005-03-24	4	2	2

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"All of Pixar's films have been very good in my opinion, but each one seemed to either lean a little to the youngsters(Finding Nemo, Toy Story) or to the older folks(Monsters, Inc.)  ""The Incredibles"" manages to dance the line between all demographics and comes across as the perfect mixture of young and old wrapped into one.  It has slapstick, silly humor for the very young, it has adventure and suspense that will knock the socks off of older children and young teens, and it has a brilliant storyline that pulls in the older audience.We've all wanted to be great at sometime in our lives.  Mr. Incredible and his wife, Elastigirl, are given that chance.  But thanks to a few snakey lawyers and their lawsuits, our heroes are driven into a sort of witness protection program for superheroes.  Unable to deny his need to protect the innocent, Mr. Incredible, along with fellow ex-superhero, Frozone, secretly helps out those who are in need of a hero.  Of course, this all leads to a trap that is set by Mr. Incredible's arch-nemesis, Syndrome.  What follows is a family adventure that encompasses all age groups.My daughter, who is three, was scared a little when the Incredible children are chased by a few mechanical monstrosities.  What amazes me is that she loves to watch the ogres in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films and they don't phase her one bit.  All I can come up with is that she is scared because other children are in harm's way.  Anyway, there is no foul language or themes that will drive away viewers.  Everything is fairly safe, but it holds your attention the entire time.  Folks with meek or quiet children who scare easily may want to preview this one before letting the really young'uns watch this, but I don't think there is too much contained herein to offend.Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee master the attitude, style, and charisma of their respective characters.  It's amazing how Pixar can manage to take actors and actresses whose stars aren't quite as bright as many others and crank out a great movie.  They have restored my faith in REAL actors.The action is fast-paced and fun to watch.  If you like the action in ""Spider-Man"" or ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" you will not be upset.  The whole film has that ""comic-come-to-life"" feel about it.  There is suspense, drama, and some sweet moments as well.Highly recommended.  I'd give it five stars, but the only detraction I have is that the movie does run quite long.  That's not a good thing if your three year-old is the type who can only handle about an one-and-a-half hours of ""sitting quiet"" time.  If you don't have kids, consider this a five star flick."	4.0	Something For Everyone	2004-11-23	0	0	0

But somejust can't get the urge to fight crime out of their blood. Like Mr.Incredible. He loves being a family man (a family who also all havesuper powers) but a 9-5 job in an ugly, greedy corporate world is morethan he can take. So he quietly slips back into the super-hero biz, andeventually drags the whole family in as well.All done with terrific animation, clever wordplay, great voice acting,and a nice comment or two about the traps of trying to be 'normal'. Itgets all the balances right; humor to action to character to story.The blu-ray looks amazing, the extras are fun, and you don'thave to be a kid to love it (my wife and I watched with adultfriends - we all had a great time).	5.0	Wonderful, fun, smart family friendly animation	2012-07-24	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3W2P28QQ823AX	Kieran G. Mooney	The Incredibles is, pardon the cliche, incredible. Director/writer Brad Bird has truly brought the world a great comedy that resonates with both action and fun. The art direction is beautidul, the first time Pixar has animated human lead characters, and the voice acting is spot on. However, what really makes this the best animated movie of all time is the writing. Bird delivers on all levels giving a thrilling plot with plenty of deep and tongue-in-cheek humor. His satires and social commentaries are there, but subtle, really only for parents eyes. Anyone will enjoy this movie, whether you are a weathered comic-book fan or a 12 year old kid there is something for you. Its ironic how the best scripts seem to written for animated pictures that are usually overlooked and seen as childish. This picture deserves the best original screenplay oscar, hands down.	5.0	An enjoyable flick for anyone	2005-02-24	4	0	4
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	Successful animated films such as Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, and Toy Story are a number of films that Pixar Studios has made during the last decade.  This time Pixar releases another hit, Incredibles, which brings an important social issue to the silver screen for the whole family to enjoy in witty, fast-paced, animated action comedy.Socially acceptable tendencies usually encourage people to behave in a manner of conformity, as negative responses from the community could possibly harm the individual if the individual does not conform.  Assimilation is the process adjusting with conformity to new information or situations.  This means that a person who changes his or her own unique identity does so in order to fit in with the majority.  On occasion, the majority forcefully pushes their values on the minority, which forces the small group to assimilate to the standards of the majority.  In essence, assimilation can be far worse than persecution, as the individual's identity could be erased to nothingness.  Incredibles applies this notion to superheroes, as they are forced to go into hiding and conceal their natural superhuman abilities.Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has superhuman strength that he uses to save people and prevent crimes.  However, Mr. Incredible's superhuman strength gets him into trouble when he saves a person who tries to commit suicide.  It leads him and other superheroes into persecution, which forces them to assimilate into the society.  Mr. Incredible assumes his true identity, Bob Parr, a very unhappy insurance agent, without ever returning to the life of being a superhero.Some fifteen years later Bob still drives a small car back and forth from his job and home in a suburban neighborhood where all homes look identical.  At home his wife, Helen Parr (Holly Hunter), formerly known as Elastigirl, maintains the home as a homemaker, which includes raising three children.  Bob and Helen's children have also acquired superhuman powers, which they are not allowed to use since it could bring them trouble.  Nonetheless, it happens that they use their powers to get into mischief and other troubles at home.Bob breaks the monotony in life by hanging out with Lucius Best (Samuel L. Jackson) who used to be the superhero Frozone.  Together these two ex-superheroes sit and listen to the police radio, while occasionally acting on a distress signal without consideration for the consequences.  Helen finds out about Bob's nightly adventures and tells him to stop as it could bring more danger to the family.Out of the blue a woman approaches Bob and informs him that his special talent is needed.  Again without thinking things through Bob turns into Mr. Incredible, as he wants to do something to feel alive again and not feel trapped in the suburban tomb for the living dead.  This time the danger seems to be more dubious and more dangerous than what he has ever before encountered and he might need some extra help in order to defeat the evil that is coming his way through the villain Syndrome.The filmmakers at Pixar bring the audience a terrific cinematic experience through superheroes that are forced into hiding.  Incredibles deals with several issues besides assimilation such as coming of age, love, parenting, and much more.  These issues are brought to the audience through drama, humor, and suspense, which are depicted through some remarkable computer animation.  The film gives the audience an opportunity to burst out laughing and bite their nails in suspense while leaving the audience with an entertaining experience that will leave some pondering about the issues presented in the film.	5.0	Fun-loving, Witty, Fast-paced, Animated Action Comedy!!!	2005-03-23	5	1	4

Most of the time when I go see a Pixar film I laugh out loud and I laugh out loud hard. I realized that I made it through the first half hour of the film without ever really making a sound. The film was much more violent than any other pixar film as well. It wasn't REALL BAd but I was somewhat surprised on the amount of it. Granted they have to have some sort of violence because it is a superhero movie. The voiceover weren't bad. Holly Hunter just isn't the right type of person to do voiceovers. She is a wonderful actress but she just wasn't believable as Elastigirl. As for Craig T. Nelson, I was pleasently surpised. I thought he did a pretty damn good job. Jason Lee, who plays Syndrome, is wonderful. Then again I would never ever say anything bad about Jason Lee because I think he is one of the best actors that exist in todays pop culture age. He is a breath of fresh air and bring real life into the movie. Spencer Foxx who plays Dash also does an excellent job in catching his character. Sarah Vowell who plays Violet doesn't seem to be given that much to work with and the character of Violet herself is such an overplayed one. The animation was wonderful of course though, with Pixar leading the way.	4.0	It was pretty damn good	2005-03-02	15	2	13

She looks like a cross between John Lennon and Edith Head with Buddy Holly glasses, and Brad Bird is a brilliant voice talent.  I also love Mirage although more backstory on her would have been welcomed as she turns from power-attracted supervillain helpmeet to life-cheerleading superhero ally.How do superheroes live among us?  Batman skulked in the shadows.  Wonder Woman was a mistress of disguise.  Superman played squeaky clean mild mannered reporter (ironically the 1940s and 1950s cartoons were surprisingly feminist for Lois Lane, before she was consigned on TV to helpless Superman-rescues and griping at Clark Kent, at least until the modern era caught up.)We're a society that's lost the ability to distinguish between celebrity and heroism.  We also sue for any little thing and prevent people from being themselves---witness the science fiction short story ""Harrison Bergeron"" in which there's a Handicapper General.  We are also an entitlement society, in which disappointed child Buddy, shrugged off by Mr. Incredible (okay, superheroes aren't perfect), doesn't find his own power and make something of himself--he becomes a supervillain, ""Syndrome.""  In a society of victims where we celebrate ""graduation"" from the fourth to the fifth grade, how can true heroes exist?We need those heroes.  We need mothers like Elastigirl (voiced by Holly Hunter and resembling my voice teacher, celebrated actress Samantha Paris), who tell their daughters, ""You have more power than you realize.""  Amen.  And any mom will relate to being a superhero in disguise, pulled, as Elastigirl literally is in one scene, in multiple directions.  All the Incredibles family members have powers recognizable in ourselves: Violet, the teenager, can put up defensive forcefields and disappear--oh yes, and she sounds and looks at times like Raven of ""Teen Titans""; ""Dash,"" the little boy, is good at being fast, causing trouble and escaping from it; Jack-Jack, the baby, can turn into an indestructible robot and also a screaming monster as well as an adorable cherub; and Bob, aka Mr. Incredible, has superstrength.This is a great social satire.  Now if only Disney's films could get their act together.  Ironically the Disney Channel is making great strides.There's also a heartwarming family togetherness here, making The Incredibles truly incredible.  And did I mention I love Samuel L.

What makes a true hero? Is it his or her talents and abilities (in this case, the ability to knock down buildings or stretch like a rubber band or run super-fast)? Or is it something more subtle, something in the spirit, the courage to face up to one's foibles and weaknesses and overcome them and in doing so, make the world a better place. Is it better to celebrate mediocrity, the concept that everyone is ""special"", or should we not celebrate the exceptional ones among us, uplift them and admire them for their special contributions to the world? If you are a thoughtful person, this movie will leave you asking these questions. It will also leave you laughing, the dialogue is hilarious, the characters realistic and believable. The romance-obsessed teenager, the mischievous little boy, the housewife who is suppressing her true heroic nature, and the husband withering away in a cube farm--these are people you meet every day, and you might be one of them.

Alvarez	It's been years since I've seen this movie but my kids are going through a &#34;superhero-phase&#34; and so picked this out of the list when we went looking for a movie rental.  It's a great family movie, exciting enough for the older kids and not too intense for little ones.  Like most Pixar movies there are some jokes that are for the adults and some for kids and most are for both.  It had a great message about being yourself and also about being content with your everyday life.	5.0	Forgot how good this movie was	2013-09-16	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3BA4BXJ6HFG94	Laurence L. Oliver	"Not many movies have impressed me over the last few years. The Incredibles actually surprised me. As an avid comic fan back in the day, I saw a lot of familiar elements (Superman and Fantastic Four, specifically) that made the movie worth buying.Another thing I like about this movie is that the father is just a guy who happens to be a super. Plus he was never made to be a buffoon. If you look at many of today's cartoons, the fathers are often child-like, absent-minded or just all out stupid (I'll name names: Billy And Mandy, Jimmy Neutron/Timmy Turner). Bob Parr was a good father who supported his family and had no problem telling his wife he loved her. Line that up against any other cartoon show or movie character. It barely exists anymore.Overall, it's a great movie. It was worth adding to my collection (I always tell my daughter it's MY movie and that she can watch it, Nemo is hers, lol). My only question is: why wasn't there a sequel? Before you respond with ""Pixar never does sequels..."" remember Toy Story?"	4.0	Superhero, family, DVD, Collectors item	2007-12-29	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A9ET6RP68TJVZ	Lauren Luckinbill	Plot wise 'The Incredibles' is Pixar's weakest showing so far. The big 'Problem Needing Solution' part of the major dramatic curve comes up late in the movie. About half way through the film, actually. And while attempts are made to heighten the tension, in the form of an ex-fan cum wanna be arch nemesis, the climax falls flat. Dramatically, it's a disappointing movie. I walked away from my first viewing feeling vaguely unsatisfied. Even with all this, 'The Incredibles' features some killer redeeming features in the form of it's characters.The characters and character interactions are the strongest Pixar has come up with in any film they've done so far. Superheroes in the real world is not a new idea but it's masterfully well executed in this movie. It's characters are additive. The Parrs come across as very human. Their powers don't define who they are, they still have work and school and all that jazz, the powers are a side thing, they mostly complicate the characters' lives either for good or bad.Visually, the movie is stunning, obviously it's the best Pixar's come up with so far. Ever since 'Toy Story' first came out I've been wondering where they're going to go with this CGI technology, like what's the point of these movies? 'The Incredibles' finally answered that question for me. The characters in the movie look like living, breathing cartoons (with spectacular looking hair and in very real looking fabrics). I remember thinking when I saw this movie in the theatre that this must be what cartoon characters would look like in the real world. The movie's worth seeing if only for this.	4.0	Never Quite Warms up Plot wise, but the characters make up for it	2005-09-23	0	0	0

There are LOTS of fighting scenes and guns in this movie.  There are also fighting scenes where the Incredibles' adversaries die.  We thought it would be a good movie for my son since he liked other Pixar movies, but this one made my jaw hit the floor within the first 20 minutes.  It's waaaaay too dark for kids and too childish for adults.  The baby bursting into flames at the end would probably give most kids nightmares.  This was a total waste of money and should be completely avoided.	1.0	Incredibly awful!	2005-04-04	84	6	78
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"Comic book superheroes are basically vigilantes who usually operate outside the law, although certainly many of them have associations with law enforcement authorities (e.g., Batman the Batsignal, Hellboy and the F.B.I.).  Some of the best comic book stories of recent years, such as Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons' ""Watchmen,"" have explored the idea of what happens when society decides to get rid of its superheroes.  Actually, they have dealt with what happens when the banned superheroes come back, which is the subject of Pixar's latest triumph, ""The Incredibles.""  The difference, of course, is that whereas ""The Dark Knight Returns"" is tragedy, ""The Incredibles"" is more of a farce.  Besides, whereas Batman has pseudo-familial relationships with Alfred and the latest Robin, the Incredibles are a two-generation family of superheroes.We begin before the end for the superheroes of this world as once again they are called upon to save the day.  But this is a world where no good deed goes unpunished because there is always a lawyer around to make sure of that.  The next thing we know, we have jumped ahead to a world without superheroes, or, more specifically, a world in which superheroes are trying to live ordinary lives.  But Bob Parr a.k.a. Mr. Incredible (voice of Craig T. Nelson) is having a hard time because there are just so many good deeds out there begging to be done and people to be rescued from burning buildings.  Meanwhile, his wife Helen a.k.a. Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) is trying to lead a normal life raising their three paranormal children, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and baby Jack Jack (Elie Fucile & Maeve Andrews).On ""Bowling night"" Bob and his best friend Lucius Best a.k.a. Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) sit around and talk about the good old days, and sometimes engage in a little undercover superhero work.  This has not gone unnoticed and when Bob learns that there may be a place for Mr. Incredible in the new world order, complete with a new costume courtesy of Edna 'E' Mode, he is more than willing.  Now, all he has to do is hide his new ""job"" from his suspicious wife.  Meanwhile, just because the superheroes have all been retired does not mean that the villains are playing by the same rules.  As Mr. Incredible points out at the start of the film, ""No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again.""The superpowers of the characters in ""The Incredibles"" are pretty basic.  Mr. Incredible is basically Superman stripped down to strength and invulnerability (or Wonder Man if you read Marvel instead of DC), Elastigirl is a female version of Plastic Man/Mr. Fantastic, Violet has both of the Invisible Girl's powers (i.e., Invisible Kid + Kid Psycho), Dash is super fast like the Flash/Quicksilver, and Frozon is Ice Man without turning into a walking icicle.  As for Jack Jack, let us just say that the final report on the tyke is not in yet (i.e., Franklin Richards squared).Director Brad Bird has parlayed his traditional animation efforts ""Family Dog"" and ""The Iron Giant"" into this computer animated Pixar film.  ""The Incredibles"" avoids the question of where did the first generation of superheroes come from, so there is no concern with visitors from a strange planet or bites from radioactive spiders, and few will ponder the reproductive niceties of Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl reproducing (remembering the ""Elsewhere"" story where Lois Lane died when the superbaby started kicking will help sober you up).  Bird keeps the rules simple, you accept the premise, and go along for the ride.The key thing about this ride is that it is both fast paced and creative.  My favorite sequence is when the family is in danger and Violet needs to step up to the plate and use her powers or else they are all going to be dead.  You know what is supposed to happen at this point, but it does not happen, and if you do not end up thinking that Elastigirl is the most competent superhero in this film then you are just not paying attention.  I also liked the discussion on villains ""monologuing"" (remember the ""SNL"" panel discussion involving James Bond villains?) and the jump cut on the car toss scene at the end was very cool as well.  ""The Incredibles"" is, of course, a comedy, but it takes itself seriously, which is why it ended up being rated PG and why this one is a keeper for comic book fans of all ages."	5.0	The Incredibles not only have the name, they have the game	2005-03-26	7	4	3

When the disc starts up, the first Disney opening screen (with the castle) takes about a full minute to display, and *cannot* be bypassed at all.

I don't think I have to go into how this is one of the greatest animated movies of all time (I think enough people already know that!).  But what I wanted to comment on was how great the extras on the DVD are.  The making-of featurettes are actually about....how the movie was made!  What a big change!  I get frustrated with many of the extras on most Disney DVD's.  The making-of featurettes are usually nothing but the overpaid actors patting themselves on the back about what a great job they did and how much fun they had.  But the DVD for the Incredibles contains none of that, which was a welcome surprise for me.  They actually take you in great detail through all the steps of the production.  There are hours worth of such features, and it's all very interesting!  All the extras on the DVD have substance.  This DVD is nothing short of fantastic.	5.0	Great extras!	2005-04-26	4	3	1

The film is so great in all ways that I wish I could give it ten stars.  The story is about Jack Parr, who used to be Mr. Incredible, a super-strong superhero.  But he was retired by the government, along with the rest of the superheroes, when our litigious-happy society got out of control, and the government could not afford to settle all the lawsuits against superheroes.  All the heroes were relocated, and told to just fit in with the rest of the populace, and to conceal their superpowers.And so our story begins.  Jack is married to the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter).  They have three children: Dash, Violet, and Baby Jack-Jack.  Dash and Violet have superpowers, but are discouraged from using them.  Mom stays at home, while Dad has become an overweight, depressed insurance adjustor. The themes in this movie are very valid and very touching.  One theme is: why bend over backwards to make EVERYONE feel special - then no one will be.  Jack questions the importance of going to his son's ""graduation"" from fourth grade.The main theme is that life is empty without doing what you are meant to be doing.  Jack meets secretly with another superhero, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) to listen to the police scanner and to sneak in and help - unseen.  A mysterious woman offers Mr. Incredible a secret mission.  Seeking meaning in his life, Mr. I. seizes the opportunity, while keeping it from his wife.Superheroes are not the only ones languishing, and longing for the glory days.  Uber-designer Edna Mole longs to design costumes the way she used to.  When Jack comes to her to patch up his old suit, she designs a brand-new suit for him - and one for each member of his family, even though they are not practicing superheroes.Edna completely stole the show.

Eskildson ""Pragmatist"""	"This is a 2004 computer animated film produced by Pixar and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.I was more than delighted with this movie.  It is a movie that all ages will find incredibly entertaining! It has a terrific story filled with comedy and thrills to keep everyone happy and engaged. The animated characters are unique, smart and fun to watch.  Pixar does an over-the-top job (as usual) with animation and design backgrounds.The movie starts with the marriage of the Parr's.  Because of rescue gone wrong and lawsuits, the government orders the Parr's to establish new identities and live a normal life as an average family in the suburbs. The Incredibles are the Parr Family- Bob, Helen, Dash, Violet and baby Jack-Jack.  Each have their own unique incredible super powers.  Bob Parr, who was ""Mr. Incredible"" misses his former super hero life and works at night with a former super hero friend, Lucias Best - known as ""Frozone"".  They sneak off at night to fight petty crimes.A mysterious woman, ""Mirage"" contacts Bob to offer him a job as Mr. Incredible to stop a rogue robot ""Onmidroid 9000"" on a distant island for a large amount of money.  Bob has lost his boring insurance job and not told Helen, his wife, so agrees to the deal.  He has to get back in shape and get a new super hero costume.  The costume designer, Edna, is a hoot.  One of the well-developed wacky characters that you immediately smile at.  Bob goes to the Island and is able to stop the first Onmidroid 9000.  He is paid a handsome sum of money and returns home to buy new cars, and presents for his family.  He is soon asked to return to the island for another job.Helen becomes suspicious of Bob's activities.  She sees a suit repair and knows that he has visited Edna, a top notch designer.  When talking to Edna she finds that Edna not only created Bob's new suit, she has created a new suit for each member of the Parr family.  Each has a homing device.  Helen uses this to find Bob's location and, as a licensed pilot, gets a jet to find Bob.  Dash (the speedy son) and Violet (able to be invisible) stow away on the plane.  They crash near the island and Helen uses her stretch super power and Dash's speed to land on the island.Syndrome is the evil one - he has always wanted to get even with Bob from his hero days. He is on the island with his assistant, Mirage.  He wants to get even with Bob from past slights.  Bob is captured by Syndrome with Mirage's help and is angry to find out through their security devices that his famiy is on the island and at risk.  From here there are many close escapes and adventures as a family.  Mirage turns on her boss, Syndrome, and helps the Parrs to escape and catch up with the Omnidroid heading for Metroville.  It is damaging the city with its ability to learn and fight opponents.  Assisted by Frozone the Parrs get the remote control and destroy the Omnidorid.When they return home, Syndrome has discovered the Parr's identity.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2436BQ1B8TDL1	Lumbrefrio	I'd give this movie 3.5 stars, but since I can't, it gets 3.  This is way to much a comic book rip-off.  It practically screams Fantastic Four.  The only difference is that instead of the Human Torch we had Dash with super speed.  My complaints:(1) Sooooo slow to go anywhere.  The first 45 minutes or so should have been condensed.  I guess it's character development, but all I see is a cartoon.  Too serious and no action.(2) Not that funny.  Most of the scenes that people laughed at weren't funny to me.  Elasti-Girl stretching to make a parachute is funny?  Happens all the freakin' time in comics!(3) Lackluster story.  Why is it always revenge?  C'mon, Pixar could have done better.(4) Not enough use of super-powers.  What good is a movie about super-powered heroes if the first half hardly has them doing anything?I don't know.  All I can really say is that it was too long, wasn't that funny, and not enough action.	3.0	Disappointing...no other way to say it.	2004-11-06	26	4	22

This stars the voice of Craig T. Nelson as an out-of-work superhero trying to raise a family, keep a job, and be a normal part of society. But his superpowers beckon him to return to the superhero world once more, and this time, he's got the whole family with him. The humor has lessened since 2003's ""Finding Nemo"" and in place of it is awesome action that is superbly animated.

The news is pretty violent (especially given our current state of affairs).

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AQVAGHP82MND	Maestro Y	"The Incredibles is a great film. It is exemplary of state-of-the-art CG as well as whimsical yet thrilling story-telling. I happen to like this movie a little more than Pixar's last hit Finding Nemo. That said, the quality of this release as a DVD is not quite as high as that of Finding Nemo.Having bought the wide-screen edition, I missed the full-screen right away. The film sometimes seemed ""Squished"" into a vertically-short space - tops of heads routinely got cut off, and somehow that seemed to degrade the viewing experience. For Finding Nemo, the frame was expanded to get the Full-Screen version - so you saw everything you saw on the big screen, plus a little extra below and above. I miss that on this release.The commentary is also lacking. The Animators' commentary is mostly ""geek-talk"" and inside jokes. I heard half the material and learned nothing new about compupter animation (with the exception of the fact that the hardest thing to do was to put a hand through a whole in the fabric). Brad Bird's commentary is insightful only as far as the writing process is concerned. He clearly knows/understands very little about CG (he's a 2-D man - says so himself), so his commentary is the kind where more than half the time is taken up by recollection of what a great job everyone did.The short features are amusing. Also amusing are some of the easter eggs. There are very many. I would suggest you check some easter egg website to make sure you find them all. The most interesting one is a version of The Incredibles staged with sock puppets.These are just a few of my comments on this DVD. On the whole - great movie (5 stars), and an ok DVD (3 stars)."	5.0	Quite good - not perfect	2005-03-17	4	3	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3FY1GXS48WR8B	"M. A. Filippelli ""Marc12074"""	The Incredibles,I saw this in the theater and was totally involved in the story line which was hard at times because the animation is so outstanding. I am happy to say that the animation transferred well to DVD.The story is basically about a couple super hero's that are forced into retirement by law suits. They get married have children and try to adapt to normal lives encountering normal day to day problems. Circumstances eventually force the Incredibles into becoming super heroes with the help of their old Super hero friends to overcome the evil Syndrome who as it turns out was driven to evil by being rejected by Bob (Mr. Incredible).In scene selection mode the scenes actually play out instead of still shots that you normally get. There are two short stories Jack Jack attack which starts out as Karri the baby sitter being interviewed by a detective that looks like Detective Fish from the Barney Miller TV series, and Boundin which was the short that run before the movie in theatres. There are other features like story boarding ideas that is interesting, there was another opening to the movie, some characters that aren't in the final movie, there is a character called Snug that was the pilot instead of Elastigirl. You get to see how the story develops and what ideas were scrapped. There is also some nice director's commentary.  This is great animation movie for families.	5.0	The Incredible Incredibles, more Pixar magic	2005-03-15	5	4	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	The Incredibles is a fully-fleshed out and developed computer animated story that isn't just another summer kiddie flick. The Incredibles family members aren't cookie-cutter cartoon characters but real people who just happen to look like something out of a cartoon. :-) The intelligent and well written script won the writers a best script award and along with the amazing special effects they combine to produce the best animated film in many years. The action scenes are entertaining as well as spectacular, and after a while you hardly remember you're watching an animated film because the plot and characters seem so realistic and true to life.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	Most superheroes don't like to throw it in our faces, but -- accept it -- they are better than us.  Way better.  Brad Bird, the writer-director-voice behind The Incredibles, isn't shy about this quiet truth.  In fact, Bird even dares to suggest -- Heavens! -- that maybe even without superheroes, some of us are more equal ... okay, better -- than others.  So the heroes in The Incredibles have two kinds of enemies -- supervillains and a society that wants nothing more than to make everyone equal (and therefore equally mediocre).  Who leads the fight for mediocrity?  Liberal lawyers, of course ... those insidious creeps who not only want to turn basic human emotions and conflicts into money, but are hell-bent on [...] concepts of legal equality into factual equality.Yes, boys and girls, The Incredibles actually stands for something that ought not be controversial, but is.  If you want your kids to go on believing that people are all the same, watch out!  This movie might quietly burst that silly illusion.It's also a darn good movie -- more of James Bond, than of Toy Story, full of action, explosions, and peril.  The dialogue is crisp, and there are no ridiculous fart jokes.  This isn't Shrek.  The folks at Pixar are too intelligent to aim that low.This film is a vast improvement over the so-so Finding Nemo, and is every bit as good as A Bug's Life and Toy Story.	4.0	Funny and a bit edgy.	2004-11-28	8	7	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3KTTW7UVZ8WIA	Manish Laxmikant	"Firstly - even though I enjoyed the movie on the big screen maybe two or three times, I still watched the DVD twice and dug through all the extra stuff. Highlights of what I like:- Jack-Jack attack. This really fills in a gap in the film, like what happened to the babysitter while the four were away.- The profiles. The movie touches on these superheroes by name or short anecdote, but this extends the experience a little further.- Deleted scenes, even alternate stories. More to soak in what the movie couldn't cover in a single sitting.Superhero cartoons usually make my head hurt if I watch them for this long. Some part of my brain objects to the flat drawings not bringing the ""feel"" right, say of tossing a huge heavy object, or running at super speed. This film not only eliminates the traditional cartoon inadequacy, but it does better than live-action films in conveying the weight of the object being carried by Mr Incredible, or the superspeed thrill Dash experiences. Even the force-fields of Violet are real-feeling.Add a great story, if a bit dark because of so much reality - which other movie does so well bringing out the monetary liabiliity, the fidelity risks, the feelings of rage, attachment, mediocrity, some apathy, and fears? I even enjoyed how the family powers play in their duller lives.All this makes me want to see the movie at my own pace and drink in more of the parts I like (Dash's first all-out dash is one of my favorites). So after having owned and watched the DVD over the months I've had it, it remains one of my favorites."	5.0	The DVD is a great complement to the movie	2006-03-23	0	0	0

(or for those over 15, ""Totally cool!"")After five consecutive hits, it's tough to imagine how the animation and storytelling superpower could outdo themselves, but they pulled it off! With a retro feel and a blend of humor and James Bond-style action, comes 2004's most anticipated new animated movie. From the first frame to the closing titles, ""The Incredibles"" balances incredible animation with a fun and touching story that has something for everyone.Without a dull moment, the movie captures your imagination and makes the life of the Parr superhero family seem as real as yours or mine, as they very much face the same ailments and challenges that we encounter in the way. Big bellies and tight clothes, a frustrating job, an annoying boss: who hasn't faced some of these (maybe all) at some point? This makes it tough not to relate to Mr. Parr and his family of superheroes, confined to living a ""normal"" life after an ungrateful society and a host of lawsuits put his kind under public scrutiny and forced him out of his 'sexy' role, in charge of saving the world.Animation highlights almost top the story, making the characters more than believable. Shots of the characters floating in the sea, perfectly looking low-lit scenes and even a rescue scene in the midst of a fire are only some examples of the type of technical work you are up against. And it's all so natural, they make it seem easy!The truth is that there's nothing easy about putting together such a solid movie. A story that makes you think and laugh, and a technical achievement that is bound to become another classic. In short, ""totally wicked!""

As I said in the beginning, I watched the film with this last soundtrack on (Argentine Spanish) and without subtitles, except for a few names of places. Also, I must say that, contrary to what most people think, the Argentine Spanish version is superior to the other two Spanish dubs AND to the original English soundtrack.This is true. I'm a huge fan of PIXAR films (I have seen ""Finding Nemo"" once)and, what I must admit, this isn't a DVD rental, but I have actually purchased this DVD from my local BLOCKBUSTER store.Bye bye, Amazon team.P.S.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	"The world used to rely on superheroes to protect us.  But when their powers started hurting people, they were forced to go into hiding and only be known by their secret identity.Fast-forward 15 years, and you get the Parr family.  Bob (Mr. Incredible) is a claims agent at an insurance company.  Helen (Elastigirl) has really taken to the roll of full-time wife and mother.  And they have three kids.  Violet is a teenage girl who can turn invisible and create force fields.  Son Dashiell can move extremely fast.  Then there's baby Jack-Jack.  He might just turn out to be the only normal one of the family.One day, Bob gets a secret message about an island that needs his help.  Since he hasn't adjusted at all to living a normal life, he secretly heads out.  What he doesn't know is that it's a trap.  Now the entire family will have to come together to survive this crisis.This movie works on a couple different levels.  There's the action, of course.  The main storyline moves quickly and entertains in spades.  Then there's the other stuff.  The people at Pixar did a good job of creating normal family situations for their super hero characters.  Violet and her powers especially are the perfect match.  And the scene with the parents arguing over how to get to the villain's machine while traveling at super speeds down the freeway is hysterical.And that's the great thing about this movie.  It moves with ease from family drama to action to comedy without missing a beat.  Because of the super hero storyline, small kids won't enjoy it as much as previous Pixar offerings.  But the rest of the family will find it highly entertaining.Once again, Pixar shows that it knows how to do DVD right.  Disc one of this two-disc set contains the movie in widescreen with full surround sound.  Transferring directly from the digital source, it looks and sounds great.  There are two great commentaries for this movie, one with director Brad Bird and Producer John Walker - the other with several key animators.  Disc two features behind the scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, and a couple of shorts.  ""Boundin'"" played in the theater before the movie.  ""Jack-Jack Attack"" is all new, and features the story of what Jack-Jack was up to that created all those frantic phone messages we heard near the end of the movie.  There is a brief segment called ""Incredi-Blunders,"" but don't be deceived.  It's mistakes in rendering and not bloopers like Pixar used to do.  (BTW, anyone besides me miss them?)This film is great fun and extremely deserving of its recent Oscar win.  Pixar has another winner on its hands.  I hope their winning streak continues for quite some time to come."	5.0	For Incredible Fun, Get This Movie	2005-03-23	6	3	3
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3E832FY3AIKFT	"Mark Clegg ""Nathan's Dad"""	"At the time of writing we have little more than the trailer of this film to measure it's merits. Sure, Pixar have an unbroken track record including A Bug's Life which, on release, was unjustly compared to Toy Story and has always lived unfairly in it's shadow. Sure, the premise of a family of super heroes returning to work after a prolonged absence is high-concept enough to hold an interesting story (not to mention Pixar's now famous comedy writing). And sure, the trailer is funnier and better made than a lot of the films it has had the misfortune to precede (it was the only thing worth seeing at The Haunted Mansion). But let's look at the facts...Several months ago, during the fine-tuning of this film, Pixar announced it's split from Disney. Disney had given Pixar it's leg-up only to see it's offspring out-perform it in every way. Shrewd as ever, Disney had got an iron-clad contract with Pixar for a seven-picture deal as well as, important this, control of all of the characters created for the films. This means that all hopes of the often rumored Toy Story 3 are shattered unless it is made without Pixar's involvement - and, considering Disney's output lately, I for one would prefer to not see it happen at all. Of course Disney, never one to shy from flogging a dead horse (Pocahontas 2 anyone?!), will immediately start churning out garbage featuring Woody, Flik, Sully and Nemo for a quick buck. This will be Pixar's sixth film for Disney (with Cars to follow next year) and it's possible that the fruitlessness of working FOR Disney as opposed to WITH them, may have made the folks at Pixar a little less willing to produce top-quality fayre. However, this would seem to be cutting one's nose of to spite one's face since Pixar would do well to maintain their high-standard so that when they leave Disney they leave with a better reputation than their 'parent' company. This will definately leave Disney with an 'empty nest' feeling. An empty nest that will soon be filled by Chicken Little - apparently Disney's move to produce all of it's theatrical features in CGI - the sounds you hear are Uncle Walt spinning and people snorting in disgust as they remember Disney's Dinosaur.Also, for your consideration, is the competition. Finding Nemo knocked King Simba's crown off the top of the box-office charts only to have it picked up recently by a flatulent green ogre. Shrek 2 has shown that Disney and Pixar are not the only two names in animation and with many more studios jumping on the bandwagon we can only hope that Pixar don't suffer the same fate as Disney has over the past few years. The makers of Shrek 2 have already credited Toy Story of being the daddy, calling it the ""Snow White of CGI"". Let's hope that Pixar doesn't become the ""Disney of CGI"", which would have been a compliment as recently as 1997, but which now sadly isn't.I hold my hopes high and proud for The Incredibles. I do the same for Cars and all of Pixar's future output - they deserve it.The bile that I spit in the direction of Disney is fuelled by love and frustration - not hate. I am a long time fan and DVD competist - I even bought Treasure Planet! I just hope they know what they're doing and  do it well. If anyone from Disney reads this please remember:- STORY FIRST! We love gorgeous animation but hate style over content. Walt knew this and Pixar know this - learn from the masters."	4.0	Can Pixar Keep It's Crown?	2004-07-14	24	6	18

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1EVNK86T7H97B	Matthew Clower	"I purchased The Incredibles in passing, because I had heard that it was a *fun* movie.  After watching, I was very, VERY pleased with the movie.The first time through I couldn't stop laughing, it was absolutely hilarious.  The movie starts by building comic book setting where the existence superheroes is commonplace.  They all have their own powers and secret identities; our protagonist, ""Mr. Incredible"" has another *usual* day for him in a non-stop animated action sequence that causes him to be late for his own wedding, everything from getting a cat out of a tree to stopping a speeding train from certain doom; no job is too small or too large.After the fallout, in litigation and discrimination, the superheroes are all forced into exile, including Mr. Incredible his new wife, (also a superhero), and their soon-to-be three children, two of which are also supers.  Since their children were born after the superhero crackdown, they've spent their lives hiding their special abilities and just never feeling right.  Amid the confusion, they don't realize just how *normal* their family actually is, superpowers or not.When the children are called upon to contribute their powers to help save their family and the world, they are at first a bit overwhelmed, but quickly realize just how *natural* it is for them to run on water and disappear into thin air.  There isn't much that will bring a family closer, quicker, than realizing that you need one another and working together overcome almost certain peril.The Incredibles is an A+ overall and has a well-written, diverse, hilarious, and action-packed comic book storyline that will be enjoyable for the entire family.THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION includes several little skits, commentary, and footage that are not only entertaining but very interesting.  One in particular is a hilarious skit where the teenage babysitter, Kari, tries to stimulate the baby mentally by playing Mozart's Minuet Ala Turka, inadvertently causing the superbaby's powers to literally explode."	5.0	Incredible, Exciting, MUST HAVE	2005-06-14	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2R6RA8FRBS608	Matthew G. Sherwin	"This 2 DVD release of The Incredibles is truly something to rave about. The movie plot is well thought out and voiced by the actors; the cinematography, choreography and animation are superlative; and Pixar makes a movie about characters you can actually care about! The picture quality is flawless. The movie even won Best Animated Feature Film of the year at the Oscars just two weeks ago! What a coup! GRINThe story (as some people may know) is about a family called The Incredibles. At first Mr. Incredible is doing what any normal superhero would do, you know-save the city from destruction and balance this with family life. Then because of politics and lawsuits against superheroes as a group the family is forced into a ""relocation"" program because it is no longer so wonderful to be a superhero anymore! (They even are given new names to protect them against the proliferation of lawsuits against the do-gooder superhero group! Now are they the Parr family.) Mr. Incredible (now going by the name Mr. Parr) is bored and miserable (to say the least); he gets an offer to do some extra work and he takes it. (I'm keeping this part brief to avoid plot spoilers.) Ultimately, things turn rotten and then Mr. Incredible HIMSELF has to be rescued instead of the other way around! Moreover, look for some well written great scenes regarding the family's personal issues: how the people in The Incredibles family deal with being different; how Bob and his wife deal with the fact that she is comfortable as a mother while he still craves the superhero ""lifestyle;"" how the issue of mortality is played out; and what the children go through as they try to conceal their differences from most others in the world. Yes, the film is essentially an action movie with some violence but don't let that fool you. There are quite a few poignant moments here. The PG rating is because of a few of the action scenes; so remember that this movie is not the best choice for toddlers or children who might get upset by it. Some people also say it's a few minutes too long-again, DON'T let them or even Amazon reviewers tell you that; this movie is terrific and I was really sorry when it ended! The last hour especially is action packed and very well done!The movie won a second Oscar for sound editing at this year's Academy Awards ceremony; and it was nominated for an Oscar for its achievement in sound mixing but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The two DVD set is presented here with an almost endless assortment of ""incredible"" (!) extras! There are two full length commentaries on disc one. One commentary is by Director/Writer Brad Bird and Producer Jon Walker and some of the animators do an audio commentary on the second track. The first track is indeed more personal since the two men had such a close personal relationship; but the second track is a real must for the serious animation enthusiast who's got to know about the process of animated film production. There are so many deleted scenes! I can't remember when I saw a two DVD set with so many deleted scenes-decide for yourself which ones might have worked well in the movie! There is the exclusive short ""Jack-Jack Attack"" about Jack finding out he has special powers while Kari the babysitter is there with him. There's the extra ""Incredi-Blunders"" and TWO features (not just one) about the making of this movie. There'll be very little left unanswered for anyone after they watch both of these! The interviews with Director Brad Bird are captivating and really informative! GRINSomething else that is interesting is the extra ""Vowellet,"" an essay by Sarah Powell, who voices Violet Parr: a great insight regarding Powell's perception of voicing an animated superhero. Then there's ""Boundin',"" a short Oscar nominated feature about a sheep with a bad haircut!  My personal favorite of the shorts would have to be ""Mr. Incredible and Pals,"" a short made to resemble something found after being lost in a vault somewhere since the 1960s. The characters in this animated short move their mouths the way animators drew the mouths at that time. This extra includes Frozone and a mute rabbit named Mr. Skipperdoo.Obviously, this is a grand slam home run for Pixar-and WE reap the rewards watching it over and over again! I highly recommend this two DVD set. When choosing it, remember that this is sold in EITHER full screen or wide screen; both versions are not being sold within the same package. Regardless of which view you choose you can't go wrong since Pixar has produced the full screen version so that all the action is viewable on your screen. Go ahead; try to find a better developed and reproduced two DVD animated movie-you'd be mighty lucky to achieve this; I don't think there's anything else around as well done as this!"	5.0	A MIND-BLOWING 2 DISC SET OF POW!	2005-03-14	14	13	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	"""The Incredibles"" is another digitally animated hit from Pixar Studios. It's a spoof of the superhero genre, as well as a spoof on the audience that found it so amusing. It's one of the more clever movies of 2004.Suppose there was a superhero and his female counterpoint. They race around and do good. What would happen in America, the movie asks? They'd be sued as a consequence of their lawbreaking. They'd be retired.Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, who have married, are retired by law and sent into a relocation program. There they take mundane jobs and sire three kids.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1W6FFD9OYH5RZ	"Matt Russell ""superk23"""	On a day that Dreamworks releases its biggest title of the year on DVD, Pixar releases their newest addition to the computer-animated genre, The Incredibles.The film opens with Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson, yes the guy from Coach) doing typical superhero stuff:  saving a cat, stopping a high speed shootout, catching a burgular, getting married, the usual.  One thing he didn't plan on was getting sued for saving a man trying to commit suicied.  This opens the door for other superhero being sued, and they are issued to live normal lives under a government program.  All of this happens after Mr. Incredible crushes a fan's dreams of being a sidekick.  This will come back to hurt later.In fact, 15 years later, we pick up with Mr. Incredible trying to live an ordinary life.  He and his wife, Helen(Holly Hunter), are trying to raise a family.  There kids happen to inherit traits like Dash has lightning-fast speed and Violet can go invisible and create force-fields.  Yet, they must be cautious in not showing their powers because it could cause them to be relocated and freak everybody else out.Still, Mr. Incredible just can't let go of the good ol' days, and he longs to be a hero again.  He is often depressed and monotone.  Every now and then, he and his pal Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) do a little minor superhero work just to relive some of the moments.  Then, one day, Mr. Incredible gets an assignment from an annonymous person.  He later learns, after he's captured, that the person hiring him as a superhero is none other than the boy that wanted to be his sidekick, Buddy, or now known as the evil Syndrome (Jason Lee).  He has developed a cunning scheme to get rid of all the past superheros, cause havoc, and then come and save the day and get all the credit for himself.It all ends with the whole family trying to save the world from the plot of the evil Syndrome.  Will they succeed?The Incredibles does more than provide entertainment and laughs, it also teaches family values.  There are issues in this film like proper parenting, marital problems, and something that is lacking these days and that is to sit down as a family and eat a meal.  It also looks at how these superheros have to adapt to being older and out of the limelight.  Like Spiderman 2, it shows that there is more to deal with than crime, you must deal with yourself.  Like all Pixar movies, there are plenty of laughs for kids and adults along with adult themes that will go over the heads of younger audiences.  All in all, a great family film.  Five stars for being the best animated film of the year.	5.0	Here they come to save the day	2004-11-05	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A55IJURK7SF6P	Max	This was definitely a wonderful movie worth seeing. It is much better than most other recent popular animated movies of the last half-decade (Shrek, Shrek 2, Ice Age, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, Toy Story 2, etc..). It starts off somewhat slow (but still entertaining and necessary to the plot) until about halfway through when the big picture starts to unfold. The movie has a collection of very unique special effects, not seen anywhere before. Some of the chase sequences in particular, are absolutely breathtaking!On the other side, the sound was top notch too, with quality voice acting and fitting music. Jason Lee, particularly, was a great villain. It almost felt like an animated Bond picture from the 1960's at some points (the music and the underground lair, particularly). I would recommend The Incredibles for folks of all ages. This is a very fun and easy movie to watch.As a bonus, the animated short, Jack-Jack Attack, is an interesting piece that goes over what happened with Jack-Jack and his babysitter. This is just one of several quality extra features included on the DVD.	4.0	The Incredibles breathe life back into animated film	2005-03-25	4	2	2

Trapp	"Every once in a while you will sit down to waste two hours by watching some random movie and instead of having your corn popped by the equivalent of cinematic bubble gum, you are treated to something very special, a film experience unlike any you have ever had, a movie that totally surprises you with its quality and depth. I must say that I had this experience while watching Brad Bird's The Incredibles. I don't have enough space here to write of the endless ingenuity, original perspectives, and overall cleverness that pervade this film. In essence, it is something of a parody of the world of superheroes, and yet it is a parody that somehow seems more indicative of normal human experience than any of those other ""real"" superhero movies do. Like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films, the heroes here are superhuman, but they are not unhuman. If anything, the fact that they have superpowers only enhances the difficulty they have as they try to make it through life. Part of the brilliance is that this is done in a family context. When you see Mrs. Incredible (aka Elastigirl) trying to wrangle her kids around the dinner table with arms that can stretch to ridiculous lengths, you understand that it is a metaphor for what a real mother has to do every day. The Incredibles is inventive, exciting, funny, and very poignant. I anxiously await the sequel, which, given the success of this one, is surely to be made."	5.0	One of the best of 2004	2005-08-23	1	0	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AQWET84VK4920	McAndrews	"With the sucess of Dreamwork's ""Shrek"", ""Shrek 2"", ""Shark Tale"", etc....The bar has been raised quite a bit for computer animated full-length features. With the dissolution of hand-drawn animated features, Disney has decided to place their animated future in the shaky relationship they have with Pixar. I must admit that I had high expectations for ""The Incredibles"" because of the quality of the above mentioned films, along with the Disney classics such as ""Finding Nemo"", ""Monsters Inc."", and the ""Toy Story"" films. To my pleasure but not to my suprise, the geniuses at Disney and Pixar put out yet another quality film for the whole family to enjoy together. It's funny, it's cute, but the best part of the movie are the characters. It had some humor for the adults only, while the rest is packaged just right to be entertaining for everyone. Like I said, I went into the movie with high expectations. So, any of you out there that watch movies like I do, know that with high exprectations, come a high possibility of dissapointment. I enjoyed every minute of this movie, and watched it again the very next day. I would recommend this film for any Disney fan, or anyone with kids.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1W72G1LXWB0R1	"M. Capps Jr. ""Right Reader"""	"This is a very un-hollywood cartoon, and for that I love it.  It delivers a truely positive message, that you shouldn't accept mediocrity and strive to be your best and do your part.  SO many films have told us to worship the un-productive of our society not noticing how this demonizes those who actualy have the ability and desire to contribute.  The incredibles is the exact opposite.  In the spirit of Ayn Rand, the heros are the most able bodied people in the movie. They want to use thier raw talent and super skills to help the world, but also to satisfy their own ego.  They are stopped by the instusive forces of trial lawyers and big government.  But in the end, individualism wins out.  A very positive message for these times against a sea of self pity films.The special features are alot of fun too.  It must a been a blast to make this film and the ""making of"" sequences show that.  I would highly recommend watching the ""Mr. Incredible and Pals"" cartoon with commentary.  I couldn't stop laughing.Who knows if this movie intended to be a societal satire, but in the end it succeeded in being a great critique and great entertainment.  No need to rent it.  You will want to watch it over an over again."	5.0	Great Fun and Great message	2005-03-26	2	1	1

How about the kid Dash; remind you of DC's The Flash. And hey that invisable daugther who stated out with a Veronica Lake Hairdo, abeit very greasy,does she remind of The Fantastic Fours Invisable Girl?But the worst insult was the baby who briefly turns into The Human Torch and in the next moment into a mini version of The Thing.I'm not sure who they ripped Mr. Incredible from, but it seems to be a multiplex of traditional comic book heroes.After viewing this exreme plgeristic theft I wonder where Flash Gordon and Ming the Terrible were.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A30WASPGRK3OYW	Melanie	This movie has ruined cape-wearing for me. Who knew they were such health hazards?In this Pixar movie, a family of undercover superheroes are living quietly in suburbia but are forced into action to save the world.Bob Paar was once Mr. Incredible, one of the world's greatest superheroes, known for saving lives and fighting evil.  He and his wife, Elastigirl, have been ordered to give up their superhero careers and are living in a witness protection program as if they are just your average humans.  Then Bob is approached about a top-secret assignment and everything changes.This story is well written and the characters are more human than a lot of characters who are actually human.  They have emotions and big hearts and they love, make sacrifices, discover truths about each other and themselves, suffer, and feel loss.  They also argue about which is the right turn on the freeway and deal with unruly kids who have strong wills and their own minds about how things should work.  The animation and visuals are glorious and stunning, and the story itself is inspiring, unbeliebably creative, and downright extraordinary.  I especially love the scene where dash is running with a layer of Violet's force field all around him, so he's like a gerbil in a plastic ball!My entire family loved this movie when it was in the theatre and we had to have the DVD as soon as possible (which is rare in this penny-pinching household) so we could experience it all over again.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3KEZLJ59C1JVH	Melissa Niksic	"""The Incredibles"" is a movie that adults will enjoy as much as kids. Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) was a famous superhero until a bunch of people started filing lawsuits against the superheroes who saved them. Together with his wife, the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Mr. Incredible enters a sort of superhero witness protection program. The couple assume new identities, Bob and Helen Parr, and raise their three children (two of whom also have superpower tendencies) in anonymity for the next 15 years. Bob is miserable in his job as an insurance claims specialist, so when a mysterious informant offers him the chance to play hero again, he jumps at the opportunity. Unfortunately, the whole thing turns out to be a trap that was orchestrated by a superhero wannabe that Mr. Incredible angered many years ago. Mr. Incredible/Bob soon finds himself in the middle of a very sticky situation, and his wife and children have to return to their superhero roots in order to save the day.I absolutely loved this movie. It's very funny and original, and all of the characters are fantastic. In addition to the Incredibles, there's Bob's best friend Lucius Best, the former superhero Frozone, who is voiced by Samuel L. Jackson. (""Woman, where is my super suit?!"") My favorite character is a quirky little woman with big glasses named Edna Mode who designs superhero outfits. Every word out of her mouth is HILARIOUS! (""Yes, words are useless! Gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble!"")This film has a PG rating. Unlike most animated films, there's a lot of shooting and people dying in ""The Incredibles."" I don't think it's excessive at all and it's certainly tamer than most of the stuff kids watch on television these days, but some overly-sensitive parents might have a problem with it.Overall, I loved this movie. It was much better than I thought it would be because it's not a typical animated film...in some respects, I think adults will actually get much more out of it than kids. ""The Incredibles"" is a fun movie that also stresses the importance of family and teamwork. Parents will enjoy watching this movie with their kids and adults who don't have kids will enjoy it, too!"	5.0	First there was Batman, then Spider-Man, and now the Incredibles!	2006-06-11	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"Pixar Animation Studios produced another brilliant and superbly animated film in 2004 entitled ""The Incredibles"".  Beginning several decades earlier, the story begins in an age when many superheroes were saving lives and stopping criminals and were highly respected by law enforcement and the general public.  However, this thankful climate changed when people who had been injured began to sue the superheroes for injuries incurred during one their attempts at rescuing.  Three such superheroes were Mr. Incredible (a.k.a. Bob Parr; voice of Craig T. Nelson), his wife Elastica (a.k.a. Helen Parr, voice of Holly Hunter) and Frozone (a.k.a. Lucius Best, voice of Samuel L. Jackson).  To stop the numerous lawsuits and damage, the government decided to force all of the superheroes into retirement and to place them into a program to keep them hidden.  Of course, they were not permitted to use their superpowers anymore, even though that is exactly what they all wanted to do.  After many years, Bob & Helen Parr had three children: the oldest a daughter named Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), the next oldest a son named Dashiell 'Dash' (voice of Spencer Fox) and the youngest a baby named Jack Jack (voices of Eli Fucile and Maeve Andrews).  The Parr family does its best to live normal lives, but Bob is really miserable in his job, especially because of his very unpleasant boss.  He yearns to relive the good old days of saving people and one night, while he and Lucius are looking for someone to save while listening to a police scanner in a car, they are being watched.  The person watching them is a woman named Mirage (voice of Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a), who works for a mysterious man named Syndrome (voice of Jason Lee).  She offers Bob a chance to use his abilities as Mr. Incredible and to be paid handsomely for it, but there may be an ulterior motive.  Another fun character is the superhero costume designer named Edna 'E' Mode (voice of Brad Bird).The quality of animation used by Pixar in creating ""The Incredibles"" is some of their most realistic work to date.  It is no wonder that ""The Incredibles"" won the Oscars for Best Animated Film and Best Sound Editing, and received Oscar nominations for Best Achievement in Sound and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.  The film's story was one of the best that Pixar has ever produced (ranking right up there with ""Finding Nemo"" from 2003), and I wholeheartedly recommend it.  Overall, I rate it with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  Many thanks go to the numerous people that helped to create the film."	5.0	Superb Animation, Brilliant Story and Engaging Characters	2005-04-17	2	2	0

Honestly I think Brad Bird must be a magician to have crafted something so beautiful and subtlely complex.  I am in awe of this Pixar creation.  Best film they have done so far by a longshot.  Everything about it is perfection.  Can't say enough good things about it except to say anyone who says Shrek is better than this needs to get a life and a brain.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1CDNTB7377YH2	Michael A. Newman	I had heard that this was by far the best Pixar film.  Therefore I went with my kids expecting to be enthralled for 2 hours.  What I got was a movie that was good but had a lot of periods where I found myself losing concentration.Yes the movie has its moments.  There is a lot of good adult intended humor thrown in.  But I am sorry that this movie is not nearly as good as either Shrek film or either Toy Story film.With a villian who is probably more annoying than Lord Farquard from Shrek , the movie also seems to have ripped off the Fantastic Four to come up with their characters.  Let's see the similarities Mr Incredible - Mr. Fantatic (similar name), Plastic Girl - Mr. Fantastic (same power) Invisible Girl (same powers), Mr. Incredible - the Thing (both super strong).  And then the boy is the same as Quicksilver and the Samuel L Jackson character is the same as The Iceman.My kids (11 and 8) preferred the Spongebob movie to this one.  I gave that film 5 stars and this one 3 and a half.	4.0	Good but not great!	2004-11-23	3	1	2

They fight crime where ever they go but soon people dont want super heroes saving their lives anymore and soon they just become not wanted and they all become everyday citizens. 15 years later Mr. Incredible is working at a office company working for with this snotty boss, voiced by Wallace Shawn (Princess Bride, Clueless). What Mr. Incredible's wife doesnt know is that him and his friend, Frozone, voiced by Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Vol. 2) go out and fight crime. Soon, Mr.Incredible is back in action as he goes to visit a secluded island where there he meets a badguy namedSyndrome, voiced by Jason Lee (Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back), who years ago was put down by Mr. Incredible. Syndrome has evil plans ahead. Mr. Incredible's wife and his kids, Dash and Violet soon come to rescue him. Pixar and Disney have done it again creating a fun filled adventure for the whole entire family and it plays off like a super hero movie as well. The characters are enjoyable especially the old lady who creates the super outfits. Elizabeth Pena (Rush Hour) voices the sidekick lady of Syndrome.

Yes, it's a story about a family of superheroes, but it's also about lawsuits, family life, the dangers of capes, midlife crises, ""feel good"" education, and fandom.  The script is so broad in its reach that this film is good for a *lot* of viewings.2004 was a dreadful year for movies.  This is one of the few joys that it produced.I especially appreciate the emotional dimensions that the film evokes.  Elastigirl's lecture to her children about supervillains carries a bitter punch that sounds implausible (""Elastigirl's lecture to her children about supervillains""???), but which somehow really works.I saw the Iron Giant in the theater and couldn't understand why it didn't do well.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	"THE INCREDIBLES will undoubtedly take animation into a whole new realm.  Once restricted to kiddie type movies with talking fish, toys, and or monsters, THE INCREDIBLES is an animated James Bond movie with a dash of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER and FATHER KNOWS BEST.  Writer/director Brad Bird gives us endless scenes of peril, fast chases, derring do and a considerable amount of violence for the ""expected"" animated film.  But as I said, this is not what we are accustomed to in animated entertainment.  The animation in this film is unquestionably incredible; you won't remember seeing anything quite this cinematic like in your usual animated fare.  The voice actors are superb, from Craig T. Nelson's Mr. Incredible to Brad Bird's amazing Edna Mode; from Holly Hunter's Elastigirl to Jason Lee's Sindrome.  The Actors Guild should protest the lack of credit the voice actors are given in these films.  In the closing credits, while struggling to see who voiced who, the voice cast is so small one can hardly read it, while all the tech guys are larger than life.  I for one am interested in who did what, so that's just a hint for future animated films.  Don't forget the movie would be nothing without the voices, folks!Anyway, to criticize this movie in any way would be almost anti-American, so I'll only say that while this movie is definitely a crowd pleaser and sets new standards, it is a little too violent in nature for younger children and it only reinforces the amount of violence propagated by our video games and now our cartoons.  So, while I hope we see more imaginative films like this one, I hope Pixar and others don't forget the animated films that AREN'T realistic or lifelike.  Movies still need to take us to places that we aren't going to feel like we live in; talking animals, far out space adventures..we still have a place for them, that I hope the success of THE INCREDIBLES does not diminish.  Nonetheless, THE INCREDIBLES is an incredible achievement."	5.0	INCREDIBLY WELL DONE	2005-03-27	7	5	2

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3PPXVR5J6U2JD	"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien"""	"In the vein of Mystery Men and Unbreakable, the Incredibles is about modern sensibilities applied to standard superhero tropes.  In this case, it's the golden age of superheroes in the 1950s.  The timing is critical, because the government informally backs the superheroes and attitudes shifted in the 60s to skepticism and outright distrust of Big Brother. Several things happen at once as the plot is set up: Mr. Incredible (voice with kindness and strength by Craig T. Nelson) repeatedly rebuffs the preteen president of his fan club (Buddy Pine, voiced to perfection by Jason Lee), makes a date with his wife-to-be (Elastigirl, voiced by Holly Hunter's soft Midwestern purr), and saves a man who was trying to commit suicide.All in a day's work, right?Well, times change on the superheroes, but they don't change with them.  The person he saved sues Mr. Incredible.  The insanity of a man trying to commit suicide by plunging to his death and then suing a person who saved him from himself is an apt parallel for the madness of frivolous lawsuits. Soon, every superhero is being sued and the general populace doesn't WANT to be saved anymore.So the government packs them all off to relocation programs, and suddenly the superhero personas are inversed.  Their daily personalities are the masks they wear at work, while their superhero personalities are unspoken, dark secrets.Fast forward to years later (late 60s maybe?). Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl now have three children: Violet (Sarah Vowell), a teen with the power of invisibility and force fields, Dash (Spencer Fox), a precocious preteen who can run at lightning speed, and the baby Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile) who...doesn't have any powers.The family exhibits all the behavior of a normal American family - or at least, the normal family we wish we all had.  Mr. Incredible, as Bob Parr, is frustrated by his insurance job and the inability to actually help people.  As a superhero he seemed larger than life; as a working slob, he literally bursts from his tiny cube and can barely fit in his stuttering car.  And of course, he has an irritating speck of a boss named Gilbert Huph (a character Wallace Shawn voices to irritating perfection) who harasses Bob at every turn for helping customers, not shareholders.Bob's wife, Helen Parr/Elastigirl, has a different set of problems.  She struggles to help her incredible children blend in a mediocre world. Dash acts out because he can't join any sports.  Violet struggles to be noticed but hides in plain sight behind her hair.  And of course, the two of them fight like crazy.And thus Pixar has perfectly captured the American family tropes.  How many parents have boys who they just wish would tire out?  How many teenage girls wish they were invisible? What mother hasn't felt stretched in all directions? And every cubicle dweller (guilty as charged!) finds a Matrix-like connection with Bob, trapped by the most diabolical villain of all: real life.Bob hangs out with his buddy, the very cool Lucius Best, AKA Frozone (Samuel Jackson) in a role as an African-American hero who has also been retired. The contrast between this role and Jackson as villain in Untouchables should amuse fans of both films.  In the evenings, these two guys lie to their wives and go fight crime.  It's the only thing that makes them feel alive.Eventually, Bob's flirt with the dangerous life comes to a climax when he's finally had enough of his job.  He takes on freelance work and finds a new zest for life.  He loses weight, he starts wearing suits to work, he buys a new car, and he keeps Ms. Parr very happy.  In other words, Bob acts like he's having an affair.And in some sense he is.  Mr. Incredible is doing what makes him feel young again.  That there does happen to be a beautiful woman (Mirage, voiced by Elizabeth Pena) who lures him into that lifestyle only makes the indiscretion all the more riveting.  When Bob disappears on one of his missions, it's up to the family to rescue him.Throughout, there are a variety of threads that tweak the superhero genre. Edna Mode, voiced by Brad Bird, is the Dr. Ruth of superhero fashion designers. She repeatedly demonstrates the liabilities of wearing a cloak and opines about the challenges of crafting a superhero's costume.  Superheroes are disappearing, literally, for reasons that become apparent later.  And the government gets tired of keeping their heroes quiet.  Indeed, there's a hint of Vietnam in the ambivalent relationship between the former superheroes and their keepers.What's amazing about this film is the depth of the characters.  By now it's expected that each animated personality will perfectly embody the mannerisms of the actors who play them.  Syndrome is a masterful interpretation of the actor who voices him, with every mannerism and sideways glance.  Only James Woods' Hades in Disney's Hercules comes close.  Elastigirl manages to come across as strong, vulnerable, protective, fiery, and even playfully kittenish - Hunter has her down pat.  Elastigirl, a stay at home mom mind you, has made such an impression that there are several threads discussing her on the Internet.  No seriously, go check and you'll see what I mean.Equally as important is the relationship between the characters.  Elastigirl inadvertently flies her children into danger and then desperately struggles to keep them alive and calm.  Violet worries about being grown up enough while Dash freaks out over - and then just as quickly embraces - fighting bad guys who want to kill them.  Mr. Incredible's mettle is repeatedly tested and by overcoming each challenge we understand that he is a genuinely good, if frustrated, father and husband.All throughout, the movie never stops taking itself seriously. Elastigirl tells her children to use their powers to save themselves and that the bad guys WILL kill them.  Bad guys do not conveniently hop out of their aircraft, but rather go up in flames.  That's right, they die. And there is a lot of tension (the good kind) between Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, early in their relationship and even years later.  They love each other, like each other, and sometimes piss each other off, just like a married couple.The part that made me laugh out loud the most involved Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, arguing over directions as they drive a battered RV through city streets on the way to battle a super menace. The kids whine ""are we there yet?"" Elastigirl shouts, ""take the exit!"" Mr. Incredible shouts that he thinks he knows a faster way.  And for a brief second, despite the fact that the entire family is wearing bright red costumes and possesses superpowers, we understand that this is YOUR family, shouting, arguing, and loving each other.With the advent of The Incredibles, it has become apparent that the last haven of quality filmmaking is to be found not in cable television, but in animation.  Pixar consistently creates compelling stories that teach as well as entertain. Whether it's the joys and fears of fatherhood (""Finding Nemo""), the fear of children outgrowing their parents (""Toy Story""), or the pressures of being a creative person in a regimented world (""A Bug's Life""), Pixar has consistently demonstrated that they understand our greatest hopes and our worst fears.  The Incredibles is Pixar at the top of their game and should not be missed by anyone who loves superheroes...or has a family."	5.0	Should not be missed by anyone who has a family	2004-11-23	4	4	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1IM6GAVUQJ27X	Michael Kim	"The Incredibles is an amazing movie from the folks at Pixar. Children and adults would enjoy watching this movie together. The characters are very interesting, I especially enjoyed Edna who is a combination of Q and elite fashion designer with the supercilious attitude to match, great fast moving plot and lots of action and adventure. The action is probably not so intense as to scare little kids. My 6 year old daughter, who gets scared easily, did not flinch watching this movie. One of the great aspects about this movie for adults is the social commentary the movie makes and the influence of  the Sean Connery James Bond movies of the 1960s.1. In a tribute to the French one of the villains in the first scene of the movie is Frenchman named Bomb Voyage. Being French he refuses to speak English and makes arrogant comments about Mr. Incredible and a kid who wants to be his sidekick.2. The superheroes are put out of business because of lawsuits from people they have saved. A man Mr. Incredible saved from committing suicide sues him because he did not want to be saved, and people who were saved from a trail derailment sue because they suffered injuries during the rescue.3. The movies uses 50s motif from the cars, homes, and furniture. The 50s have been used in movies, including this one, to emphasize a society where people are expected to conform. Another very good sci-fi movie exploring radical egalitarianism ""Harrison Bergeron"" uses 50s motifs too.4. Taking a pop shot at the current emphasis of self-esteem in education Mrs. Incredible tells her pre-teen son Dash that ""Everybody is special"". In a wonderful insightful rebuttal Dash responds, ""That makes nobody special"".5. Mr. Incredible working as a cog in a soul crushing impersonal large insurance company where the goal of the company is to pay out as little money as possible. Mr. Incredible in trying to legally help his policyholders in their claims gets a brow beating from his boss.6. Much of the music in the movie is strongly influenced by the music from the James Bond movies of the 1960s with the beat and the trumpets playing with the implement in the horn that muffles the sound.7. The movie borrows ideas from the James Bond movie ""You Only Live Twice"". Just as in that Bond movie there is a rocket base/bad guy hangout  inside a volcano and a monorail system with pod shaped units running on it.8. The theme of the movie that adults can enjoy is self-esteem does not come from people saying you are wonderful but from testing your limits and achieving something. The Parr family exemplifies this. Mr. Incredible, Bob Parr, hates how he can no longer use his abilities to help people and is stuck working as a claims processor for an insurance company. He lets himself go physically and is distant from his family. But when Bob is allowed to start using his superpowers to meet great challenges he gets himself in shape, and starts paying attention to his family. His son Dash is a trouble maker at school and at home who is frustrated by being forced to be average. But when he gets to experience real challenges and uses his gifts his attitude changes. Violet is a shy grungy kid at first but like Dash after experiencing the adventures in the movie she becomes more extroverted and pays more attention to her appearance.9. The movie shows a loving, traditional suburban family in a good light. This is the exact opposite of what Hollywood usually produces, see American Beauty."	5.0	Fun for kids and adults with great social commentary/satire	2005-03-16	3	2	1

The idea of a superhero family permanently undercover because of lawsuits is neat, to begin with. Craig T. Nelson gives a very believable style to ""Bob Parr"" (Mr. Incredible), as does Holly Hunter to Elastigirl. In fact, the animators managed to give all the characters a high degree of individuality and the scriptwriters included lots and lots of sometimes abstruse references to the world of comic books. Nice homage to Edith Head, too."	5.0	Is this thing on?	2006-01-23	3	2	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A21BBXC4CGVBYW	Michael Mass	"I had first seen this movie with the expectation of it being very tame, kid-humored and boring but it was not the case. As far as animated movies go, I thought i had seen the best of them with 'Finding Nemo'. I was right, but 'The Incredibles' falls at a close second. This movie, which captures the internal torture of retired superhero father Mr. Incredible, is proof that even animated comedies about family bonding can include a smartly captivating save-the-world plot. The most hilarity comes from baby Jack, who was thought to be a ""normal"" child...until he defeats a villain that the rest of his super-powered family couldn't. The entertainment value is increased with the smart humor that makes it fun for parents to tag along with their children to see this movie, such as the subtle pricks at the Incredible parents by their hero-ware designer. That character in this movie that you will be trying to immitate for years is the small clothes-designer, Edna. Her annoying voice and quick wit are very humorous which I think help tie the movie together. Another important theme in this movie is that you can never really give up something you truly love and enjoy. This idea helps the former superheros stay confident and want to save the world. Overall I thought it was a very entertaining movie that has good action and humor for an animated movie that is appropriate and enjoyable for the entire family."	4.0	incredibly incredible incredibles	2005-04-06	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A38ZTUNQJVGP6S	Michael Patrick Boyd	The Incredibles is one hour and fifty-five minutes and was released in theaters on November 5, 2004. The Incredibles tells the story of Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) who in his heyday belong to a group of super heroes who belong to the NSA (National Supers Agency). After he saves a man life and the lives of people on a train, people begin suing Mr. Incredible and later on other supers. The supers are forced into retirement and to lead normal lives. It is fifteen years later and Bob and Helen (his wife and former Elastigirl) have three kids and Bob works as works at Insuricare where helps client find loopholes in their claims if they are turned down. This is a job that Bob does not like and hates his boss even worse because he is heartless and only cares about making a profit. Bob winds up getting fired because he threw Gilbert Huph (his boss) through five walls because he would not let Bob prevent a person getting mugged and when the person is mugged Mr. Huph mocks the victims. Bob is now home and unemployed again and has not told his wife about what happened at work. While going through is briefcase he discovers an envelop and opens it up and there is a message like the one seen in the opening scene in the Mission Impossible TV show; even exploding ten seconds after it is played and causing the house water sprinkling system to go off. There is a message from a person who call herself Mirage and offers Mr. Incredible a job and that would pay him three times his yearly salary. Bob accepts the offer and heads to the island to destroy the Omnidroid. Mr. Incredible is out of shape and his back seems to out on him at times when he is fighting the Omnidroid; in the end Mr. Incredible defeats the Omnidroid. While Bob is waiting for his next assignment, he works out in a train while Helen is thinking he is at work. Also Bob is getting reconnected with his family and is no longer miserable. One day Bob visits Edna Mode to have his original super suit mended. Edna wants to make Bob a new suit and throw away the old one claiming she does not look back. Edna agrees to repair the old suit while at the same time making Bob a new suit. Mr. Incredible is called back to the island for a new assignment and finds out that new Omnidroid that has been update is ready to take on Mr. Incredible. It is during this fight with the machine that Syndrome is controlling the machine. Syndrome at one time was Incredi-Boy for a few brief minutes of his life. Buddy Pine, Incredi-Boy, wanted to be Mr. Incredible sidekick but told Buddy to go home because he worked alone. Syndrome uses the Omnidroid and his zero-point technology to toss Mr. Incredible around. It is with his zero-point technology that Syndrome tosses Mr. Incredible too far and accidently let him escapes. Mr. Incredible is able to save himself by swimming into a cave and hiding behind the dead skeleton of Gazerbeam. Mr. Incredible is able to sneak back into the cave and finds the information about the other Supers who have been killed by earlier models of the Omnidroid and only Elastigirl and Frozone are the only two who remain alive. Meanwhile Helen visits Edna who believes know something about Bob whereabouts. Edna thinks that Helen is here to get the new Super suits she has made for the family. While at Edna's place, Helen finds out the Bob has not been working at Insuricare the last two months and thinks he is cheating on her. Edna tells Helen to fight for her husband and go and get him. Helen charters a plane to find Bob and does not know that Dash and Violet have sneaked aboard. Back at the island Mr. Incredible has been caught when his homing signal went off; a device he did not know he had. Mr. Incredible is now a prisoner of Syndrome and Syndrome begins to torture him. He wants to know how is on the plane and makes Mr. Incredible listen to a radio transmission. Mr. Incredible recognizes the voice of Helen but does not tell Syndrome about his relationship to her. Syndrome sends out heat seeking missiles to destroy the jet and succeeds in doing so. Unknown to Syndrome and Mr. Incredible, Helen, Violet, and Dash all survive the plain wreck and make it to the island. Helen leaves the children in a cave and goes to look for Bob. She finds Bob and the two make a break from the cave and eventually hook up with their children. Syndrome is able to recapture them and is surprised to learn the Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are married and got busy, my favorite line in the movie even if I did quote it correctly. Violet is able to use her force field powers and is able to free the family. The Incredibles with the assistant of Mirage fly a rocket back to Metroville where the Omnidroid is set loose of the city and Syndrome tries to destroy his own machine but is knocked unconscious in the fight. The Incredibles and Frozone fight to destroy the Omnidroid and are successful in doing so. Syndrome is enraged and heads to the home of Parrs. Syndrome kidnaps Jack-Jack and flies out of the house with him. Jack-Jack is scared and begins to turn into a ball of fire, lead weight, and a devilish creature. This causes Syndrome to drop Jack-Jack and Elastigirl rescues her son. Mr. Incredible throws his new car at Syndrome which causes his cape to get caught in one of his jet engines and that blows up the plane and kills Syndrome. The Incredibles is the first Pixar movie to have human only in it. Also the computer animation is great too.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2R9J5LULVKF6T	Michael T. Rognlien	Has PIXAR *ever* failed to deliver a great film?  If they have, I don't recall, and they certainly delivered for The Incredibles.I won't rehash the plot because unless you've been under a rock for the last 2 months, you already know it.  What continues to impress me about PIXAR's films is that they take animated entertainment to a level of such high quality that adults AND kids can enjoy the end result without either being bored.I also like how they take current events (tort reform is the biggest comically-suited underlying issue here) and make them entertaining but thought-provoking.

When the burden is too much for the government to bear, the Incredibles are forced into retirement and into normal life through the ""Superhero Relocation Program"".  But, working as an insurance salesman doesn't hold the same thrill for Mr. Incredible/Bob Parr (Nelson), and he finds himself listening to the police scanner with another former superhero by the name of Frozone (Jackson).  That way they can still offer their help to the police.  When a mysterious stranger enters his life, Mr. Incredible finds himself presented with an opportunity to regain some of his lost glory.  Now, he is working on the sly with his wife (Hunter) unaware of what is going on, but a secret like that cannot be kept forever.With ""The Incredibles"", Pixar goes the way of the big studios by making a superhero movie.  Despite some similarity to the Fantastic Four, this idea works pretty well.  It is fun to see the out of shape Mr. Incredible stuff himself into his costume and fight the bad guys.  The cartoon violence ups the rating to PG (a first for a Pixar movie), but there is nothing too over the top here.  ""The Incredibles"" is not as good as ""Toy Story"" 1 or 2 or ""Finding Nemo"", but kids and adults alike are sure to enjoy the majic that Pixar brings to the screen."	4.0	The Incredibles	2004-11-12	1	1	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"Superman, Daredevil, The X-Men, and The Amazing Spider-Man - classic comic-book superheroes that have captured the imaginations of not only young children, but those young at heart as well across the world. Though they may have started off small in the two-dimensional world of the nickel comic-books, their popularity began to grow and expanded into spectacular franchises that were developed in the areas of television series, movies, and merchandising. Some have done better then others - as of this writing, Ben Affleck is still not speaking to Tobey Maguire - but no matter what the success, there will always be an audience for these fascinating figures. What is the cause for our fascinating fixation with these individuals and their seamlessly conventional plot-lines that are all basically a regurgitation of the vintage hero myth? In a way, we understand what the hero is going through and connect with the overwhelming obstacles that block his/her path to achieving his/her goal, what ever that may be. These amazing individuals are experiencing the same events we have experiences in our own lives, on an obviously different plane of course, and as they go about achieving their objectives, we look to them for inspiration in do so in our own time and place in the world.The story centers on a family of superheroes that try and go about their daily, normal lives as civil citizens while at the same time concealing their extraordinary powers in an effort to blend in with the regular populous. Bob Parr, a faithful husband and father of three children, drives every day to work for a sleazy insurance company that cares more about their stockholders then their own clients, only to drag himself back home and repeat the process for the rest of the year. While at work, Bob dreams of the glory days when he was the world's greatest superhero, known exclusively as Mr. Incredible! That all came to an end when he was sued by a man he saved who apparently didn't want to be saved (he leaped off the top of a building in an attempt to commit suicide). This, of course, set off a string of frivolous lawsuits against all superheroes, costing the American government, as well as the taxpayers of this country, millions of dollars. The league of superheroes were eventually forced into retirement and relocated to new locations in order to live out a life of solidarity and blend in with the rest of normal society, never to use their powers for the collective good of humanity again. One night, Bob discovers an envelope in his briefcase that holds a communication device asking him to come to a secret island and take care of a rampaging robot located there that has been terrorizing a scientific organization established on the tropic location. When it turns out to be a trap, the rest of his family, including his wife, daughter and son, must summon up their abilities in order to rescue the patriarch of the Incredible family and save the day before the world is doomed. The story for The Incredibles is, for the most part, unfortunately clich&eacute;d and excruciatingly predictable, but, then again, isn't every film about superheroes that way? How so? Within the first five minutes of the film, you've discovered who the villain is and determined in which direction the storyline is heading toward, which, in essence, eliminates any real surprises that would occur within the course of the two hour feature. Don't let this matter bother you too much though. The more appropriate question that should be asked about this film is whether or not The Incredibles still manages to be overly entertaining and the answer would unanimously be yes. See, that's the amazing thing about Pixar - they can take a cookie-cutter storyline, throw in a few dozen loveable characters, mind-blowing visual work, and pure-concentrated emotions, unveiling an absolutely genuine and memorable experience at the movies.Once again, as was the case with Finding Nemo, Pixar decides to live on the edge and create an animated film featuring few famous voices - actually, the only truly recognizable name would be Samuel L. Jackson - but if it worked before, it is certainly worth a second attempt at least. Craig T. Nelson, best known as for his television series Coach on ABC, fits perfectly into the voice-role of the leading man, Mr. Incredible. Nelson truly puts effort into voicing the emotions of Bob Parr - from being frustrated at work, to uninterested and down in the dumps back at home, to emotionally distraught at the possible loss of his family. This is another prominent area where Pixar excels beyond other studios, namely in choosing figures who are perfect for the leading role, not just because their name would look good on the marquee, but that they effectively move the film forward consistently and thoroughly with their emotional performance. Samuel L. Jackson, who voices the ultra-cool Frozone, is unfortunately underused in the film. Granted, he isn't a central character - he's more of a supporting role, the buddy figure to the Mr. Incredible figure, but still essential none-the-less - but he could have been given more scenes then the ones you can just as easily see located in the film's trailers. An absolute waste of perfectly good talent it would seem. John Ratzenberger, known exclusively as the lucky charm of the Pixar Animation Studios, is highly underused in this feature. This isn't asking for him to be given a leading part or anything of that sort, but let's not wait to use him for the very end, and if you do, not just a mere few words. This was disappointing to say the least but nothing to go ballistic about. And last, but not least, Edna Mode, voiced brilliantly by writer/director Brad Bird - is there anything this man can't do - is the most original and effective creation presented in the film. Viewed as the fashion feminista to the superhero stars, she may not be a central character based on the actions on screen, but audiences won't care as she manages to deliver the most laughs out of anyone else.Overall, The Incredibles, despite lacking the tenacious punch of such previous Pixar success stories as Finding Nemo and Monsters Inc., still manages to engage viewers and connect with them in such a spectacular and seamless way that it makes them  - well, incredible. One of the film's main problems is its serious lack of humor, at least early on, but even when it is able to get revved up by the second half, the laughs aren't as consistent and thorough as they were in either Monsters Inc. or even Finding Nemo. Don't take this the wrong way, there are plenty of amusing sequences to be found throughout the feature - this bears repeating, Edna Mode practically steals every scene she's in - they're just fewer and farther between then has been seen in previous Pixar efforts. In reality though, this helps a lot as it allows the story to be set up properly, as predictable as it may be on the surface, and the emotional attachment to the characters to set in with audience members, so that when things really do begin to pick-up, we are in eager anticipation to witness what comes next. Another problem the feature has to deal with, besides the ""been there, done that"" atmosphere it invokes, is the fact that the actions of the film begin to feel like a broken record. It just begins to feel like a continuous loop of sequences - someone's in danger then they get out of it then they're in danger again, etc. As Mr. Incredible said once, ""I feel like the maid - can we try and keep this clean for ten minutes"", how about we try something and then move on with a vastly different story idea instead of the same one over and over again. These are relatively minor quips though and shouldn't be taken for too much face value when evaluating this film with your family. The talented artists and animators at Pixar Animation Studios have truly out done themselves this around. And to think, you thought you've seen everything with Finding Nemo! There are moments where you'll believe Syndrome's Island is an actual island - the palm trees, the ocean water, and the daunting aerial view of the location are astonishing. And the waterfalls - truly breathtaking. There are so few words to accurately describe the feeling you get watching the visuals of this film - this after drooling over the latest Star Wars prequel teaser trailer moments before. And finally, in all honesty, The Incredibles has to be Disney and Pixar's most adult-skewed animated feature to date - not only does it showcase an array of dramatic explosions and presumed deaths, the touchy subjects of adultery and suicide are even touched upon in the two hour film. Even though a lot of this material will probably go over the head of youngsters, be well aware that questions may pop into their inquisitive minds and may be asked of you later on, so be prepared to answer them should they come up. Bottom-line, The Incredibles may not be Pixar's most superior film to date - Finding Nemo had more adorable characters and Monsters Inc. had far more laughs - but its an entertaining family film that gives every single member of the family something to talk about for weeks, or even months, to come going into the busy holiday season."	4.0	The Moose Hole - Truly Incredible!	2004-11-06	4	2	2
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3M2O06MCHJG18	"MiddleAgedReviewer ""M_A_R"""	"At least, that's the first thing I thought during my first viewing of 'The Incredibles.'  I thought of my 8-year old nephew, and couldn't wait to talk to him about it.  That's when I realized that I, a 36-year-old, was enjoying this movie like I was eight again.  I could almost imagine myself laying on the floor, way-too-close to the screen, eating Cocoa-Puffs straight from the box and saying ""whoa! That was cool"" a lot.Visually, The Incredibles is stunning.  The characters are wonderfully rendered homages to the claymation holiday films of the early 60's (for those who have seen the movie, tell me that ""Syndrome"" and ""Heat-Miser"" aren't somehow related!), and the detail put into everything else is superb.  One scene, for example, when the mother and son are driving home from school, I noticed that a single window on a building in the remote background catches a glint of light reflecting from the sun.  THAT kind of attention to detail is inspiring.Pixar and Brad Bird have put together an exquisite piece of animated storytelling as well.  It's a little more grown-up than the 'Aladdin' or 'Little Mermaid' animated Disney flicks that some people might expect going in (but then again, both parents survive in this film... how many Disney films have you seen where both parent figures are alive at the end of the movie?).  The content is a lot more tame, however, than most of the mind-numbing cartoons on TV today, and there is a very strong and relevant thread of family theme throughout, in tough times and in good.Yes, there is plenty of action (whoa! that was cool!), but grown-ups (as I sometimes claim to be) will find plenty to be entertained by as well.  The mundane moments of Bob and family are perhaps even more hilarious than the mile-a-minute stuff.  Wether it is Bob being lectured by his boss or Samuel L. Jackson's ""Frozone"" demanding to know where his wife placed his supersuit, this film literally takes superhuman moments and presents tham as something we can relate to and laugh about.Lots of extras in here as well, including two short films (one completely unrelated to the movie, and one featuring a couple of minor characters from the movie).  There's also a 1960's style ""Mr. Incredible"" cartoon parody that I roared about, particlarly when Mr. Incredible and Frozone's comments were played.""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Incredibles"" are firmly two of my all-time favorite fun films, and if you're out there looking for a fun film yourself, I strongly recommend this one.  Even if you don't have an 8-year old nephew."	5.0	Hey, your 8-year old nephew will love this!	2005-04-06	2	1	1

I give it 5 stars but  you should know that the special features aren't what they seem to be:-""Jack-Jack Attack"" exclusive all new short film:This is a deleted scene dressed up as a ""short film"".  It's good, but it's just a deleted scene.-Deleted scenes, including alternate opening:These are just storyboards with some commentary, not finished scenes cut from the movie like you have probably been led to believe.  The only deleted scene on the DVD is ""Jack Jack Attack"" and they're calling that a ""short film"".-""Incredi-Blunders"" bloopers and outtakes:Not bloopers, not outtakes.  These are unfinished shots of the film that haven't been fully rendered or animated.  They are more weird than they are funny.-Making of ""The Incredibles"" featurette:A nice 27 minute featurette but don't expect to see any credit whatsoever paid to the incredible voice talents of Holly Hunter, Craig T. Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Lee, etc..  It's as if they don't even exist.  What a shame.-Seven additional behind-the-scenes featurettes:Nice little featurettes about 3 to 6 min. long on Sound, Character Design, etc..  Not a word about the actors and their contributions.  Why?-""Mr. Incredible & Pals"" cartoon with optional comtary by Frozone and Mr. Icrediblemen:This is not a computer animated feature.  They are cartoon illustrations with real people animating the mouths ala the Conan O' Brian show.  Blah.-""Vowellet"" an essay by vocal talent Sarah Vowell (Violet):The most annoying voice in the movie reads an essay she wrote about her and her dad shooting an old cannon in the mountains.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"It appears Pixar is physically incapable of makng a bad movie.  Only about a year after ""Finding Nemo"" broke banks around the world, the animated wunderkinds unfurl ""The Incredibles,"" another leap in computer animation and another golden example of how moves should tell a story.  Writer and Director Brad Bird finally gets the hit he should have gotten with the classic ""The Iron Giant,"" but ""The Incredibles"" is not just Bird saying about time, he shows the same care to the story of a family of superheros as he did to the one about the huge metal man.  At one time, superheros were everywhere, saving people using their impressive powers.  But once civil lawsuits are filed at one superhero after another by people claiming they did not want to be saved, the supers go into hiding as normal averages joes.  This eventually grates on one superhero in particular Mr Incredible/AKA Bob Par (Craig T. Nelson) who wants to get back in his tights even with kids (who have their own superpowers) and a super-stretchy wife (Holly Hunter).  He gets himself duped into going to a remote island, not knowing that a new supervillian named Syndrome (Jason Lee) has his sights set on all superheros including the incredible family and their close friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson).The story may have a lengthy set-up, but it is worth it because it gets us to know the family, dysfunctions and all.  Writer Bird gets you in the head of this family of heros, making their eventual plight against syndrome all the more compelling, with the necessary detours of humor, with the funniest in the form of the short and out-spoken fashion designer Edna Mode (voiced by Bird).  But when the film does get going, does it ever rev up.  Spectacular explosions and action sequences provide pixar animators with a chane to show off their boundless prowess.  The animation is absolutely breath-taking.  Where ""Finding Nemo"" used bold and vivid colors to illuminate the sea, here the animators stretch for photo-realism, or as real as you can get with a computer animated cartoon.  But the jungle environment is eye-popping and the robotic death machine that Syndrome unleashes twitches with attitude.  With an eye-popping mix of heart, humor and animation, ""The Incrdibles"" is one of the best films of the year."	5.0	Just Look At the Name	2004-12-06	3	3	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A20UFFERPC9VYB	"M. McCaffrey ""Mickael"""	The Incredibles is my favorite Pixar film. Obviously, I have the DVD already, but even if I didn't WHY would I want a DVD copy of it at all if I own a blu-ray player?.  I really love certain movies and can watch them multiple times, but having the desire to watch it in my living room, and on my laptop at work, and in the GARAGE where I keep my DVD player currently since I now own 2 blu-ray players (one is a PS3) has honestly never occurred to me.  It's like including the VHS version as a bonus if you get the DVD version for only $5 dollars more.  Considering that this IS the reason why the item is priced $10 more than normal new release blu-rays, I can't bring myself to buy it.DEAR DISNEY/PIXAR Please stop including inferior versions of blu-ray and then ask us to pay more for them without offering us an option for just a blu-ray copy.I am utterly baffled at this practice of including what you probably ALREADY OWN with the item that you are REPLACING IT WITH.  Especially older titles such as this one that have been out on DVD for 5 YEARS PRIOR to blu-ray.  I'll wait to buy the blu-ray only copy if they ever decide to make one, even if it's just a dollar less.

Miller	"Now, I didn't see The Incredibles when it came out in theatres, nor when it received such high acclaim for reviewers or my friends, nor did I see it after the Oscar nomination.  Yet, I released what I had waited for was worth the wait.The story centers around two superheroes, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl.  In their prime they were a few of many superheroes; however, a tumultuous series of quick events (which are merely narrated to us) Superheroes are forced to put up their suits and live like the average Joe.But as us average Joes know it is not always easy, and the pull of excitement lingers oh so close.  Well, for Mr. Incredible (now spouse of Elastigirl) that pull takes him away from his family of super wife, two super kids, and one normal one.  What Mr. Incredible does not realize is the danger lurking ahead, for him and his family.First of all, I am a fan of the animation style.  This is not too much different then Toy Story, and thus does not have that quality of ""new"", but that's unnecessary.  The plot, which I hope I summarized with justice, is an exciting one although I could guess a couple of key components.Overall though, it is funny, and out loud so.  The humor is definitely family oriented, tailoring to the kids in general, but also adults, with the parental crises references and themes.  So, this film is definitely enjoyable, although I will not go so far, as many have, to rate it as Incredible."	4.0	True to form, if that means animation I guess...	2005-03-23	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2FS6OGMZMALTD	Mojo Jojo	I love this movie for so many reasons.  I've watched it way too much, and normally, that means you start spotting stuff you don't like.  Little things that don't really matter, but you'll still see 'em.Not this film.  For my money, this is the best superhero movie ever.  The action scenes alone capture the dynamic energy and cool interaction of different superhuman talents.  Before watching this movie, I always thought stretching was a pretty dumb power, but after seeing Elastigirl in action, I've changed my mind.The animation is mind-blowing.  This is Pixar after all.  And I'm glad they went with Toon-like humans instead of ultra-realistic ones.  Call me crazy, but I think animation that's indistinguishable from real life is, well, pointless.The writing is clever, absurd, and down to earth all at the same time.  These characters have life, and I care about them.  The dialogue is terrific.  I especially love that it can be funny without having to resort to countless pop culture references that end up dating so many movies in the long run.But what I really love about this movie and these heroes is that they are heroes.  I miss that in my superheroes.  Spiderman has devolved into a narcissistic weinie.  X-men have become so self-important they're too busy preaching their mutant / tolerance metaphor.  Daredevil . . . oh don't get me started.  But the Incredibles, despite their problems, save the day.  And by doing so become stronger for it as individuals, as friends, as family.It's a great message, but it's a message that isn't crammed down our throat.

I've been waiting for the price on this to drop under $20 but that may never happen at this rate. Most Pixar movies can be had for under $15 lightly used so I don't see why this one cost so much.  Hasn't Disney made enough millions from this movie, or are they still in the hole?I have Troy: Director's Cut on BluRay, it's over 3 hours and still has over an hour of SD extras on the same disc. The BluRay picture quality is near perfect (http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/976/troy_dc.html#Section3) and it was only $7.99 :P"	4.0	Great movie, but why so expensive?	2013-09-27	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AS4CCOTZUHDX6	"movie reviewer ""Evan"""	"From the Academy Award -winning* creators of ""Finding Nemo"" comes the action-packed animated adventure about the mundane and incredible lives of a house full of superheroes.Bob Parr and his wife Helen used to be among the world's greatest crime fighters, saving lives and battling evil on a daily basis. Fifteen years later, they have been forced toa dopt civilian identites and retreat to the suburbs where the live ""normal"" lives with their three kids, Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack. Itching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him toa  remote island for a top secret assignment. He soon discovers that it will take a super family effort to rescue the world from total destruction.Exploding wtih fun and featuring an all-new animated short film, this spetacular 2-disc collector's edition DVD is high-flying entertainment for everyone. ""It's James Bond, Indiana Jones and the X-Men all rolled into one"". -Peter Travers, ROLLING STONE.The ""Jack-Jack Attack"" was really good. The short film ""Boundin'"" was really good on this DVD and in theaters. The ""Incredi-Blunders"" are really funny. I hadn't viewed the""Filmmaker's Audio Commentaries"". The ""Deleted Scenes"" and ""Alternate Openings"" were good special features. ""Top Secret Files On All The Supers"" was nice and so was the ""Behind the Scenes"" type of special features. I enjoy those.""The Incredibles"" is every word on the list that means incredible: awesome, excellent, incredible and wicked. Every word that means incredible is what I will have to say about ""The Incredibles"". ""The Incredibles"" is the year's most exciting Disney movie, and it is also the best family film since ""Shrek 2"".""Shrek 2"" was an excellent movie. I thought the story to ""Shrek 2"" was extremely awesome. To compare it with this movie, ""The Incredibles"", I'd say this. I loved ""Shrek 2"" as much as everyone does, but my opinion for an award for the most intellegent animation goes to ""The Incredibles"". I thought the story to ""Shrek 2"" was much better than the story to ""The Incredibles"", but I like the animation to ""The Incredibles"" a lot more than I like the animation to ""Shrek 2"".""The Incredibles"" is like the best superhero movie, best Disney movie ever made and one of the best movies ever made. It's like all the superhero movies including ""James Bond"", the ""Spider-Man"" movies and the ""X-men"" movies; ""The Incredibles"" reminds me of how ""Shrek 2"" was an awesome animated film.TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: Theatrical Widescreen (2.39:1) - Enhanced For 16x9 Televisions; English, French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX; THX-Certified Including THX Optimizer"	5.0	"The best family film since ""Shrek 2""."	2005-03-22	1	1	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AB7W3IO5V7CT0	moviewatcher	"What happens when the superheroes of the world are forced into hiding and have to live normal, everyday lives as their alter egos/aliases?  This is what happens in 2004's animated blockbuster ""The Incredibles"".It's all in a day's work for Mr. Incredible a.k.a. Bob Parr (voice of Craig T. Nelson).  Mr. Incredible helps in a police pursuit, stops a robbery by Bomb Voyage (voice of Dominique Louis), catches a man who jumps from a building, saves a train filled with passengers about to be derailed and frees a ladies' cat from a tree.  He also gets rid of Buddy (voice of Jason Lee), his self-proclaimed ""biggest fan"" and has time to get married to Helen a.k.a. Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter).But things take a turn for the worse soon after.  Having to deal with a number of lawsuits brought on by civilians (including a lawsuit against Mr. Incredible by the passengers of the train and the man he saved from certain death), the government is forced to relocate all superheroes and keep their identities secret.Several years later we find Bob and Helen Parr living in the suburbs with their three children: Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), Dash (voice of Spencer Fox) and Jack Jack (voices of Maeve Andrews and Eli Fucile).  Bob has a job in insurance claims where he is reprimanded almost daily by his boss for helping people.  And for fun he and Lucius a.k.a. Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) listen to police radios trying to help out in different situations.Things change, however, when Bob is contacted by Mirage (voice of Elizabeth Pena) to help capture a rogue robot on a distant island.  But who controls this mysterious operation?  Will Mr. Incredible and his family become part of its growing number of victims?I was pleasantly surprised by ""The Incredibles"" and it's definitely become one of my favorite animated films!  The plot of the movie was original with not only great main characters but fun and interesting secondary characters.  One of my favorites has to be Edna (voice of Brad Bird) who is a quirky fashion diva who makes costumes/suits for superheroes.The story develops in an interesting way and is paced to keep your attention.  You even keep your eyes glued to the screen during dinnertime at the Parr household just to see what will happen next.  There's never a dull moment.The only things that could have been added to the film would be a few more scenes with Syndrome (voice of Jason Lee) just to get more of a maniacal/goofy feel for the character.  Also a few scenes to see what was happening with Jack Jack and Kari (voice of Bret Parker) would have been interesting.  (There are a few funny scenes between the two on the deleted scenes section of the DVD.)  But from the phone calls that we were able to overhear, we can imagine what was happening back at home!If you're looking for an enjoyable and fun movie then look no further than ""The Incredibles"".  It's a movie the entire family can watch."	5.0	Fun For All Ages	2006-04-07	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ	"Mr. JKW ""jkw"""	"If I could sum up Pixar's latest offering in one word it would be, Incredible.The film is a marriage made in heaven as most people would agree that Pixar animation films rock because of the animation.  Most kids (and kids at heart) also mark out big time for superheroes movies and cartoons SO a Pixar animated Super Hero flick = $$$,$$$.$$THE PLOT:The movie opens up almost like a scene out of the Batman or Spider-Man or Superman cartoons with Mr. Incredible out and about saving the day.From there the film takes a humorous twist with all super-heroes being banned from practicing their trade due to lawsuits (ah yes, only in the 21st Century can you SUE a super-hero for saving lives) and we fast forward to see the super-heroes fat and out of shape and bored.We also see that our two main characters Mr. Incredible and Elasti-Girl are now married with three mutant kids of their own.Mr. Incredible is tricked back into action by two old conniving rivals with a dastardly plot to destroy him and all the former superheroes.  When all looks bleak with Mr. Incredible sidelined it takes the combined power of the Incredibles family to save him.THE COOL THINGS:I TOTALLY dug the vibe throughout the movie.  With the initial Batman vibe as Mr. Incredible makes his way throughout town saving lives and helping people and the later ""Fantastic Four"" and ""Bionic Six"" vibe the movie TOTALLY rocked my world.The plot villain is masterfully inserted into the film with a legitimate grudge against our hero and is brilliantly weaved in and out of the film.  Awesome writing, character development and continuity from the Pixar gang.  Plus, he's actually a cool (if geeky/dorky) villain.Seeing the kids come out of their shells and display and use their cool powers was awesome.  Pixar's animation gets better and better and most of all the movie's ending seems to leave open the possibilities for a SEQUEL.THE VERDICT:Hey, if you dig Pixar animation or Super-Hero flicks or toons, you KNOW you'll see this one.Highest Recommendation"	5.0	INCREDIBLE	2004-11-13	64	53	11
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2F3M93RRLFQNJ	mrliteral	Sometimes you get lucky and the title of a movie actually describes its quality.  I once saw Very Bad Things, and it was indeed a very bad thing.  Happily, the Incredibles is just that:  incredible, an excellent movie that has no real missteps.The movie follows a superhero couple who have married but then been forced into retirement.  In the opening, a documentary shows Mr. Incredible longing for a normal life while his wife, Elasti-Girl, loves adventure.  Once retired - and hidden in the equivalent of a Witness Protection Program for superheroes - we see the irony quickly:  Mr. Incredible is bored with normality and his wife revels in it.Fortunately for Mr. Incredible, he gets a chance to do some heroics, although this leads him into a trap which forces his wife to get back into action and bring their superpowered kids along.  All the characters have relatively common superpowers.  Mr. Incredible is like Superman or Captain Marvel (albeit without flight or x-ray vision).  Elasti-Girl has the same sort of powers as Plastic Man or Mr. Fantastic.  Dash, the son, resembles the Flash or Quicksilver.  Violet, the daughter, resembles the Invisible Girl.  The similarity to many comic book heroes is not accidental but is instead an homage to their influence on the story.Although a Pixar production, this has much more in common with good live-action superhero movies (like Spiderman) than with other Pixar movies like Toy Story or Finding Nemo.  While taking nothing away from earlier Pixar movies, this is a more mature work and geared to an older audience.  Despite previews to the contrary, this is not really a comedy, although there many funny moments.  This very maturity makes this not only an incredibly fun movie but also an incredibly good one as well.	5.0	Incredible!	2004-11-19	1	1	0

"I've just recently started to watch this movie and get into more so than the first time I watched it. My 2-year old son picked it up and was happy and talkin up a storm about it and pushing it at me and my wife so we decided to watch it with him. He liked the opening the scene the most I think because it's so exciting and fast paced, sorta like he is lol. Anywho that was probably a month ago and we've all watched the movie about 50 times I'd say. it is the only thing he will sit down on the couch and watch the whole movie before bed without getting up from it. The explosions and deep bass produced by the Jet after burners, the Omnidroid rolling around, the explosions and other things of that nature in the movie don't seem to bother him, if anything he wants more awesomeness. I'd recommend this as definitely a family movie. I wouldn't listen a review that says ""dark depressing"", I mean come on, there are good guys and bad guys, what's supposed to happen? well I guess they could've started the movie then everybody disappear then the movie end.I figured since I've seen it so much I'd review it, I usually don't review movies. This movie is great, I enjoy it as much he does... maybe less... The most fun scene in the movie for me is Bob vs. Omnidroid, very hard hitting and cool music. The music makes the movie and everything in the score is awesome. Fun High screeching trumpets and loud Jazzy brass, It's quite enjoyable since I crack up any time I hear a high screeching trumpet. I read a review on the soundtrack and it said it's going for that 60's jazz style so I guess it's set in the 60's... I wonder though. All the voice talents are great except for Helen Parr, her S's are more like Sh's, correct me if I'm wrong. that's the only thing i'd change. Obviously this movie doesn't have sex in it thank goodness, otherwise it wouldn't be here in my home. I think they did a good job with designing the characters in this movie. I especially like how they adapted Buddy Pine's aging; his chin still sticks way out and his voice gets a little deeper. At the beginning of the movie you really don't know who's going to be the villain throughout the movie. I thought it was going to be Bomb Voyage but it couldn't have been because he isn't introduced or anything like Brad Bird said Snug had to be to actually know the character. still I don't know why he couldn't have been the main Villain or at least helped syndrome. Another Gripe about Helen is that it seems like every time she talks she's either screaming or yelling at whoever. ""Shteak, Pashta? what are ya hungry for?"" I think my favorite scene in the movie is very short, it's when Violet and Dash run into Bob and Helen in the jungle then Bob and Helen start actually real super hero fighting and the kids are just star struck because they'd never seen their parents actually fight. it's pretty sweet and it would've been awesome if it had lasted longer but Syndrome then intervenes and stops them from fighting.Well I guess that's an okay not so detailed review. I just thought I'd hit some high spots I enjoyed and point out the fact that my son doesn't have nightmares from watching it everyday 3-4 times a day. He likes Mr. Incredible the best of course, this is clear. he thoroughly enjoys the movie even when he's playing with his toys he's still watching it."	5.0	Fun movie	2011-07-14	1	1	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2EWC48FRNO3YP	"M. Veiluva ""sputnik99"""	"""Incredibles"" is Pixar's best to date.  I'm a little biased because I screened the beta release at Pixar Studios before it hit the theaters.This is not a ""cute"" treacly movie nor a rapid-fire souped up Alladin chase-3 laughs-a-second type film.  It is really a grown-up movie with enough action to keep pre-adolescents interested, although pre-schoolers wil squirm at points.Musch of the humor is grown up, and there are dark moments, especially in the middle third when Mr. Incredible is captured by his arch-nemises.  Some of the superheros are shown meeting violent ends.The plot line's premise is that superheros are driven underground by lawsuits by injured bystanders and would-be rescued people.  So true.  There are pauses in in the action for great dialogue, and some situations (the main superhero in hiding has to become an insurance claims adjuster, which I thought hilarious) will probably blow past kids under 10.  The scene where Ms. Incredible  has to juggle a nanny situation over a cell-phone while dealing with the baddies was inspired.  The Incredible kids relate to each other in an authentic way.Brad Bird's ""E"" character - a sort of miniaturized half-Asian/Capote/Garbo designer of superhero costumes - is worth the whole movie.  As she explains to Ms. Incredible, her costume withstands explosions, ""yet breathes like Egyptian cotton!""The movie takes risks and succeeds.  The animation is a mix of the detail we expect from Pixar blended with 40s/50s comic stylism.  This is the best full-length animation outside of Japan or France."	5.0	Thinking person's animated adventure	2005-02-24	20	13	7

The story appeals to a broader age range, making it the best family film in a long time -- possible the best family film ever.  The animation is superb, and shows a level of detail not seen in earlier films.  The sets are retro late 60's/early 70's, as are the costumes and cars.  The film is reminiscent of the great spy films of that era, too (think James Bond as a retired superhero with a family, and living in suburbia.)Two underrated characters are ""Edith"" a superhero costume designer who is a tribute to the eight-time Oscar winning costume designer Edith Head; and Mirage, the assistant to the evil villan Syndrome.  I hate spoilers, so I won't say any more.  Just see it, you won't be disappointed.Personally, I can't wait for the sequel.I'm not a big Pixar fan.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A29SJTG21BVWF4	N. Fares	well time humor, great character personalities, and a well written script, and great directing drive this movie to become one of the best animated films ever made.  This movie plays a parody on all Super-Hero's. Where two super-hero's meet and fall in love and start a family of super-hero's.  But before that happens all super-hero's are band from public view forever, due to liabilities.  Then a bad-guy comes into play after several years of our super-hero family being in hiding, out for revenge against our super-hero dad, for rejecting him as a side-kick years earlier.  The super-hero dad then is trapped.  And our super-hero family comes to the rescue.  In the end everything is right again and our Super-Hero's are once again the Hero's of the day.	4.0	Great Family Film	2005-04-10	2	1	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1LJFKIZ15WP32	Nicholas Doles	"I like superhero movies in general, and I will admit there is alot of junk out there. This movie is not junk. There is a great blend of action, comedy, and drama.The comedy usually involve the Supers use of their powers. There is a great part right at the beginning where Mr. Incredible gets a cat out of a tree by uprooting the tree and shaking it till the cat lets go. The comic parts are good enough that both parents and children should get them.The action is what you would expect. The bad guys have minions with automatic weapons and a big evil robot. There are some really good scenes where the children are figuring out just how they can use their powers to battle evil. The bad guys do die. The deaths aren't graphic. One minion is in a flying machine that hits a mountainside and explodes. You don't see him die but an adult can figure it out, but a child wouldn't notice. So if you have a problem with this don't buy it for your kid. I don't see the problem, but it's fine if you do.The drama has to do with people with Super powers living in a world where they have to hide what they are and live without ever using their powers. The idea that people with special abilities are special and should be allowed to outshine everyone else is very Ayn Randish and I enjoyed the conflict it created when the characters weren't allowed to be themselves.If you've seen the movie already you should buy this for the special features. The Short ""Jak-Jak Attack"" shows what happened to the baby sitter when the baby starts using his powers for the first time; it's hillarious. There is also a cool section where you can see the profiles of many different supers including strengths, weaknesses, and personality quirks."	5.0	A Good Movie	2005-05-05	3	2	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3UDCPLJBN8ARN	noman	Art, animation, voice acting, characterizations are all first rate. Why the two stars? Because the plot is,  I hope unintentionally, elitist. The 'villain' of the story is an awkward, nerdy young boy who is harshly rejected by the 'hero' of the story 'Mr. Incredible'  By his own efforts and genius he makes himself equal to or superior to the 'supers'. But the oddball, misfit, geek is the evil villain who must be destroyed by the naturally superior  handsome/beautiful 'good guys'(and girls) . At the end of the movie 'Dash' must hold back during a race so he gets second place rather than an easy win over the not so incredible normal people. The whole thing smacks too much of Friedrich Nietzsche's ubermensch or the blond, blue eyed supermen beloved of E. E. (doc) Smith or Edmond Hamilton for my taste. The theme seems to be that some people are born 'super' and that if you try to join the in crowd, you're evil and doomed to failure. NOT a message I want sent to children.I also found the casual,  wholesale murder rampant throughout the movie to be appalling. I expected that sort of thing in Die Hard or Alien (both of which I liked) but this? IMO it made the movie somewhat schizophrenic in that it could not decide whether it was comedy or drama.  Perhaps they simply did not have time to fully develop the ideas and plot line fully. A nice idea and brilliant CGI work. I think it might have worked better it they'd simply decided to make a fully steampunk noir movie or gone entirely for the children's market. Trying to do both, IMO, simply did not work.	2.0	unintentionally(i hope) elitist?	2009-05-21	19	4	15

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AHF97M45JFCB	ONENEO	"As hard as it is to believe, The Incredibles is already six years old now! When it came out it was pretty darn mind-blowing (despite the fact that behind the scenes Disney and Pixar were bickering to the point where Pixar would try to sever the relationship entirely but be unsuccessful at finding a new distributor).There has actually been a lot of evolution in the genre in the six years following the Incredibles' big screen debut but you really wouldn't notice due to the fact that Pixar was so far ahead of the curve back then.  About the only area that this film differs from most contemporary computer generated animated films is that a 155-minute runtime makes it potentially the lengthiest animated feature of them all.The story tells of one Bob Parr (alias Mr. Incredible), and his wife Helen (Elastigirl), a pair of the world's greatest crime-fighting superheroes.After facing a string of law suits for consequences brought about by their do-gooding, superhero activity becomes a criminal act in and of itself and fifteen years after their crime-fighting prime, Bob finds himself sharing a modest home with his wife Helen, and their three children Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack. He works as an insurance-claims adjuster, and he's fed up with his pushy boss and fairly immoral business policies.Itching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top-secret assignment. What follows is a wild discovery for the former super human that it will take the combined efforts of a super family to save the world from total destruction.While often regarded as a superhero spoof film, the truth of the matter is that The Incredibles is really not too far off the mark in being simply a non-comic affiliated superhero action film.  Sure there's the family slant that's played on a bit more than what's common in most comic hero tales and there's visual clues that make it pretty difficult to pin down an exact time frame that the story is supposed to be taking place but realistically speaking, this is easily on par with some of the live-action efforts of Marvel and DC in recent years.In the opinion of many, The Incredibles marks Pixar and Disney's perilous leap toward big kid entertainment what with a PG-rated and plenty of guns, explosions, and action-driven sequences.  The change is typically credited to outsider Brad Bird (who also wrote and directed 1999's ""The Iron Giant"").For the most part the formula he brings to the table works with a pretty even balance of domestic drama to offset the crime fighting/ action scenes.  The husband and wife do their share of squabbling and even the kids get some screen time going at each other's throats. Dramatically speaking, it is a bit heavier handed than what's usually found in a comic book or for that matter, a Disney film but again since the story centers on the concept of former heroes being thrust into the domestic lifestyle, it's excusable as a necessity.A jazzy soundtrack coupled to super crisp visuals (especially in Hi-Def) makes the flow and tone of the tale extremely easy to fall into.  The nearly 2-hour runtime goes by quite quickly for adults and children alike.In all The Incredibles is a highly entertaining piece that still holds up well even half a dozen years after the fact.  It's a little heavier on drama/ lighter on laughs than I expected but the formula works (especially where a slightly more mature audience is concerned)."	4.0	Still Solid If Not Incredible	2010-09-06	1	1	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3FZ777AC2J0G9	Pam Satterwhite	I love this movie. For me this movie is, without ANY doubt, the greatest super-hero movie made to date. This film displays action sequences that are jaw-dropping in scope, creative in execution, and as thrilling as they are beautiful. This film is a masterpiece. Toy Story and it's sequel are excellent films and I thought that there was no way Pixar could possibly continue creating that level of greatness. While A Bugs Life wasn't one of my favorites, it's still a fantastic film. MONSTERS INC. continued the Pixar tradition of making a better movie. The ending line in that film is one of my favorite closing moments in cinema. It's simple, heartfelt, and provides a beautiful impression that their world will continue in a positive direction despite the end of the movie (something that kids, the target audience, need to know). Finding Nemo, like all other Pixar films, has a strong family message and it provides us with some beautiful visuals. Again, Pixar built upon it's own accomplishments and provided us with a film that will be heralded as a classic and loved by future generations. As impressed as I am with all of the other Pixar films, and as much as I love them, The INCREDIBLES is better. This film succeeds and excels on many levels and it is difficult to express any problem with this movie, however there is one thing that I think parents of small kids need to know about this movie: it is a little more violent that you may expect. This film is rated PG for good reason. It is NOT a G-rated movie, so don't take your kids expecting it to BE a G-rated movie. In this movie people die. None of the death is really shown, and there's no blood, but I was a little surprised at the number of henchmen that are killed off. Also, I referred to the villain as murderous, and there is a reason. He is a murderer and takes delight in holding that kind of power over other people. The message is never confused and you never cheer for the bad guy. Must also recommend the movie, ICE AGE.  Great fun!!!	5.0	Great DVD	2005-04-19	3	1	2

I liked what I saw and bought the Incredibles and have now watched it many times over.  Brad Bird scores another winner with this one.Again, I hate to be the spoiler of good things, so I'll keep this brief.  The Incredibles is the story about a superhero family.  I don't know how but Brad Bird seems to be able to convey a sense of caring and connection with his animated characters.  I think it is because he develops his story very well and the story is his main concern.This superhero family starts with mom & dad superhero.  But like the great American story all things must come to be sued.  They are sued for being superheros and daring to do what must be done for the good of all and are driven underground where they cannot use their superpowers.  Then the fun begins when the world needs the ""supers"" again.  I'm sorry but I can't say anything more without spoiling the ending and I am one of those people that cannot watch a movie if I walk into the middle of it.But all things being Brad Bird, this is a score.

Varga ""Tauren Guard"""	With two more movies to go under the wrath of Disney, Pixar Studios comes out with their best yet in The Incredibles.Coach's Craig T. Nelson does the voice for Mr. Incredible, a muscle-bound superhero who loves the hero life.  To add more love to his life, he marries Elastigirl, voiced by Holly Hunter.Just after the marriage, however, a number of superheros get sued by citizens.  This results in the government putting all superheros into a type of superhero protection program which requires them to assume mild mannered identities and never use their super powers again.Jump ahead 15 years.  Our happy hero couple now have three kids: Dash, who has the power of great speed, Violet, who has the same powers as the Invisible Girl in the Fantastic Four, and Jack Jack, whose powers are unknown until the end of the movie.After getting fired from his regular job, Mr. Incredible finds a contract job in which he can use his super powers.  But, this is actually a trap set up by an overzealous fan of his.The movie doesn't have one dull moment in it.  Brad Bird, the director, has done an amazing job with the movie.  He also does the voice for the superhero outfit designer, Edna Mode.  In an interview, Brad said several people tried out for the part, but none of them had the right voice, in his opinion; so, he decided to voice it himself.  Sheesh!  Talk about an ego trip.As far as the violence is concerned, it has about as much violence in it as your average Teen Titans episode.Movie warnings: punching, kicking, explosions, woman getting choked, teen angst, and baby rage.I can easily say that this movie is worth both the matinee and night time movie prices.Have fun and don't forget to leave the cape at home.  :)	5.0	INCREDIBLE!  .. not to be confused with fantastic	2004-11-07	9	8	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1ZOYQ41EGZJ7D	"Paul ""Pauli"""	"Some people love animation and some people could do without it. I'm addressing this review to the second group of people whom I urge to watch this for a number of reasons.First, the characters. I guarantee that most people will forget this is animated for large stretches because of how interesting the characters are AND how well they are developed. Two methods are used to accomplish this brilliantly. One is the great interplay and dialogue which is typically confrontational between close friends and family members as well as between the heroes and villians. Another is the ""historical backdrop"" provided at the beginning of the movie where the heroes are shown ""back in the day"" before the primary plot conflict begins. This, I believe, is key to the success of every great story from ""Lord of the Rings"" to ""Star Wars (IV,V,VI)"" to ""Harry Potter"".Secondly, the plot is superior among animated movies. I admit I liked ""Toy Story I & II"" as well as great Japanese stuff like ""Spirited Away"", but although they are spectactularly animated they're still kid movies. This flick has a great complex superhero plot which has several great surprises and twists and isn't revealed to the audience all at once. The suspense continues until the very end which ends on an uplifting family note and ties off all the subplots for each character beautifully.Lastly, the comedic aspect is superb. From the strained family relationships stemming from the inability to use their super-powers to the ""ever had one of those days?"" theme this movie will draw in even those most critical of this budding genre of computer-aided animation by, once again, the film's ability to suspend the audience's realization that these aren't ""real people"". The overcoming of personal obstacles which characterizes the best of superhero movies is front and center in this movie, but unlike Batman and Spiderman, the family aspect gives the movie a kind of ""everyman"" applicability that the average film-goer will appreciate."	5.0	"Not just a ""kid movie"""	2005-05-22	4	3	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A35DTDBS7MJDVA	PedsRN	I've probably watched this 100 times (at least) with my toddler. Although he goes through phases (Thomas the Tank, Spiderman, Star Wars), he ALWAYS comes back to The Incredibles. It has the whole family making quotes and references. If you ask him, he'll say his mother (me) is Elastigirl, his father is Mr. Incredible, Stella (the cat, who is black...) is Violet, and he is Dash. It is a very entertaining movie for kids and grown-ups alike. I will warn you that it does contain some violence (after all, it's a super-hero-movie), and may give your small child delusions of grandeur (&#34;WHERE is my super-suit!?&#34;), so if you're not equipped for that, skip it and watch another episode of Thomas.

Most of you 5 star reviews right now probably looking at this review with your mouth like an O. Well, here's the problem with it. Not only does the plot seem a bit boring (it repeats over 5,000 times), but it takes too long for anything to happen. It took about 45 minutes for anything interesting or funny. I think it has a rocky start. If you ask me, this should be labeled as a family action film, not a family comedy. Though, I'm not a kid, so I of course don't laugh a much as a kid would.There was a great amount of action in the film, which did keep me entertained. And there were a few moments were I chuckled a bit (Mr. Incredible is very hilarious at times). So, this movie is worth it.So, the rocky ride ends after the comedy, action, and adventure start to kick-in.I don't know. I don't think it's in the same league as ""Finding Nemo"", and I think it's a little overhyped. But, it's still a fun family film, and I would recommend it.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A37B3O457INKEA	Peter Kenney	THE INCREDIBLES is a first-class animated film about a superhero and his family who are forced to seek the anonymity of a government witness protection program to escape a rash of lawsuits orchestrated by their enemies. Mr. Incredible has to endure the boredom of a job as an insurance claims specialist while his wife and children cooperate by also concealing their extraordinary powers in front of others. This is hardest on the children as they play with youngsters at school and on the athletic field. Eventually, Mr. Incredible is lured out of retirement on a ruse by a former foe. By now Mr. Incredible is older and fatter but he still proves equal to the challenge. The rest of the movie is filled with excitement and comical moments as Mr. Incredible finds himself in a tight spot from which only his family can rescue him. The cast is headed by Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter. Ms. Hunter supplies the voice for Elastigirl who is also the wife of Mr. Incredible.THE INCREDIBLES was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Achievement in Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Oscars were won for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year and Best Achievement in Sound Editing. In addition, THE INCREDIBLES won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Animated Film.	5.0	Lots of Fun and Excitement	2006-09-13	6	5	1

"The Incredibles, the widescreen 2-disc Collector's Edition, on DVD, is a true and exciting adventure into the extremely interesting lives on a home that is filled with many, many superheroes. This is the type of entertainment that parents will likely find as interesting as will their children.I am very luck to have early access to some projects, such as films, new music CD's and even some great video games. I'm involved in a fairly large review committee for a national chain of Movie Rental stores. As a result, I've been blessed with getting the ""heads up"" on some movies, DVD's, etc. And if there is ever a chance to share my opinion, even if it's not perfect, I'll be more than happy to share with anyone on AMAZON. This is a GREAT SHOW-not to be missed when it comes out in MARCH!!I watched the collection with my kids the first evening that we purchased the Collector's Edition. My kids were captivated and didn't move from their positions in front of our new television. Normally, my wife and I start to watch a film and find ourselves falling asleep, as a result of the exhaustion of parenting, but we stayed awake for this one! And on top of that, we even watched the many special features that are also part of the 2 Disc Collection. Now that should tell you something about the quality of this production!Two of the world's greated crime fighters, Helen and Bob Parr, were known for their battles over crime and for saving the lives of many. Several years after the ""end"" of their lives as crime fighters, both of them move from the city and into the burbs to live a more normal life with their three children. All is well until Bob is called for special duty to a very remote island for a very top secret mission. You will find yourself amazed at how well these stories are written and how you will find yourself enjoying this movie as much as your kids!Bob gets to the island for his secret mission, one that was delivered to him in the most amazing way. He learns that his mission is basically to save all of the world and he'll need to recruit some help-help from his superhero friends. Without the support of his family, the world would destruct and nothing would be left-not even the simple life in the burbs!This is a wonderfully animated movie that is filled with creativity and writing that will keep the parents awake for sure. Even if you're not much into the whole superhero scene, you'll find enough exciting and interesting graphics and animations to keep you bright-eyed all night long.I also think that this 2-Disc Widescreen Edition would make a great gift, especially for those neighbor friends who seemed overwhelmed and need a small break from the kids! Enjoy this great flick and feel free to laugh as much as your children do. It's okay to feel like a 5 year old again!Break out the popcorn and enjoy the film! And thanks for taking the time to read my short description of an animated film that our entire family enjoyed.[...]"	5.0	THE INCREDIBLES (WIDESCREEN) IS A MUST HAVE EDITION FOR ALL!	2005-02-18	17	11	6
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3S0IVFM83ZSE7	P. Hardy	"With nothing in the movie category to compete against in 2004s Academy Awards ceremony, the overhyped Disney movie ""The Incredibles"" basically had free pickings of whatever award it wanted chose, therefore, securing its winnings from the get-go. I never wanted to see this movie basically because; A): its a painstakingly blatant rip off of MARVEL COMICS ""The Fantastic four"" Foursome (Hence the names ""Mr. Incredible"", ""Elastigirl.""---- ""Dash"" really seems more of a copy of the cocky DC Comic character ""The flash"" of the ""Justice League"" series) and their possible celebrity status with the people of the city they save, and B): Disney movies has not been my favorite since I was little. That aside, I only watched this movie because my sister asked me to. So I did. And I have to say, aside from the ""Balant-Rip-offness"" of the movie, it did so one thing completely different from other superhero movies. After a mishap concerning ""Mr. Incredible"" saving a suicidal man from his so called-death, all the superheros are sued in lawsuit and are ordered to give up they're superhero rights, thus assuming the normal positions as everyday human beings (Nice thinking Pixar).We are then introduced to older personas of Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's lives as a married couple with two children named ""Violet"" (whom possess the power to create force fields and become invisible. ""The invisible woman"" anyone?) and the trouble-making boy named ""Dash"" (whom has the gift of super-speed). They aslo have a baby named ""Jack-Jack"" who apparently has no ability at first glance. He's just a sputtering baby. Mr. Incredible hates his job at an insurance company who does the complete opposite (thus showing the realty of most insurance companies do) of what they should be doing: Aka, helping people out with their money troubles. He tires of the mundane life he follows as an average Joe and secretly goes out and listens to police-raido frequency's to see if he can help out like he used to.When he is caught out by his wife and has a mishap at his work concerning the pummeling of his boss, Mr. Incredible is contacted by a mysterious figure who apparently wants to reinstate him in his former position as hero. From there storyline gets as predicable as any other storyline done before despite the different twists along the way. The concept of a woman sewing and creating the super-hero costumes is no new idea (heck, my mother has been raging on about this for as long as I remember). Pixar and Disney is probably the first to put the idea to use on screen. The GCI animation is probably the best I've seen in a cartoon and rivals Square Enix's PS2 ""Final Fantasy"" series. The voice acting is great, however, there are some hiccups and oddness with some characters; The characters are as interesting as Disney characters can be -- Dash is probably the most likable character in the movie despite his constant annoying high-jinxs with his hyper self. The action is not the greatest. It has its great-moments, leaving you with a giddy feeling (Flash --- I mean, Dash's ""dash"" across water while dodging rock pillars is one of them) and the ending was predictable but surprising. I enjoyed this movie for the most part despite its lagging storyline, halfcocked characters and would-be dramatic moments in between all the comedy and action. It certainly isn't as great as ""Spider-Man II"" --- [a 3 out of 5]"	3.0	Does not rival Spider-Man 2 by a long shot.	2005-08-12	5	1	4

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A33XHXRTRZOQ12	"Photoscribe ""semi-renaissance man"""	"Something has always bothered me about Pixar movies: Have you ever noticed how there seems to be SOME somewhat questionable moral aspect of the cast or the storyline? For instance, ""Toy Story"" had the formerly crossdressing, just-portrayed-a-homosexual actor Tom Hanks and former cocaine dealer Tim Allen portraying the main heroes of this tale aimed primarily at families and kids. You may forget about this as you watch and enjoy the clever, cute movie, but what were the casting people thinking?! And what about ""Monsters, Inc.""?? Am I the ONLY person that finds big, ancient Sully's affection for Boo a little disturbing?Anyway, with that out of the way, even THIS endearing flick has some moral flaws...! One thing that always bothered me about the superhero group ""The Fantastic Four"" was the Human Torch...a character that could burst into flame at will! For some reason, the ""Comics Code Authority"" has always seen fit to attach it's seal to this book as well, though it would seem that the book should be a classic target for sanctions! This has to be the most devilishly conceived character in all of comics, as emulation of the character by a less than astute child could result in an incredible tragedy! Well, in THIS movie, (in the regular movie AND the easter-egg extras disc,) we have a BABY ""flaming on"" to both foil a villain and confound a babysitter! There's also a scene in the film where two of the good guys, Mr. Incredible and Frozone, end up in a bank in ski masks after saving some people from a fire, looking for all the world just like bank robbers. They escape by freeze-drying a cop who can't really be faulted for thinking that they ARE bank robbers!!That out of the way, the rest of this movie is a blast! You can't help but fall in love with Holly Hunter's voicing of Elastigirl/Helen Parr. The Pixar animators have a real way with animating their female characters: Jessie was the best thing about ""Toy Story 2"" and Helen Parr, Edna Mode and Mirage are three of the best things about this film. Helen is protrayed as a strong, resourceful lady who is nonetheless cute as a bug's ear, and endearing. Brad Bird, the director, supplies the voice of Edna Mode...""E"", kind of an apparel-based ""Q"" for the superhero community and she is funny as the demanding, perfectionist costumer. Elizabeth Pena supplies the voice of Mirage, the villain's girl friday who secretly admires Mr. Incredible to the point where she actually tries to HELP him in many instances, but gets repaid by being roughed up by Incredible AND Elastigirl!The characterizations in the film are bang-on....the villain, a former fan of Mr. Incredible's that has become a classically paranoid inventor and arms dealer, holds a grudge against Mr. I for being rebuffed 15 years earlier when Incredible was trying to squash a bank robbery. The voice and the insane thought processes of the character are done beautfully, as is the crazed permanent expression on the character's face. Though I could have lived without the oddly shaped head of the character, Mirage's mouth contortions fit Elizabeth Pena's voice to a ""T"". Distaff brainbox Sarah Vowell does the voice of the Parr daughter, Violet, who corresponds to ""The Invisible Girl"" from the Fantastic Four. She is perfectly portrayed as a shy, withdrawn teenager.The sibling rivalry between the characters Dash and Violet Parr, Mr. and Mrs. Incredible's progeny, is comical, epsecially in a scene at the dinner table, and Elastigirl's affection for them and her husband is priceless. Craig T. Nelson's take on Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible is good too, portraying him as a gentle, but strong father figure that nobody in the family is going to walk all over.The characters also have a ""solidness"" that I haven't seen in computer animation before. They actually sometimes come off more like stop-action animated characters in the style of George Pal's ""Puppetoons"" than CGI. The textures of the eyes, skin, hair and other things are done so realistically, it could fool anyone for a few seconds.Though you have to wonder what Pixar's casting and concept agenda is sometimes, this film  is yet another feather in the cap of a studio that seems to do no wrong with the finished product, the box office takes being a testament to this.They haven't had a bomb yet, though the next film ""Cars"" looks like it might be the one that dips for them!If you have gullible little kids, I wouldn't recommend getting this DVD....but if you feel pretty confident your family is sane...."	4.0	One of the neater Pixar movies....	2005-06-01	7	1	6

The transfer to Blu-Ray is absolutely perfect. The lines are razor sharp when played on a HD TV. There are absolutely no blurriness or artifacts that sometimes characterises upscaled DVDs. The Blu-Ray experience truly stands out.The movie itself also rates 5-stars, and is an entertainer for the entire family - both for kids and the adults. A lot of adults (secretely) identify with Mr Incredible or Elastigirl, and the kids simply love Dash!! I found the scenes between Elastigirl and Edna to be the most amusing! Pixar definitely scored on this one.Jack-Jack Attack in the extra features was good footage. Some looked forced however - ""We are gonna release a Blu-Ray and we must bring the crew back and film them bantering with each other""...If you already have the DVD, there is no need to go for the Blu-Ray unless DVD gets damaged (as mine did).

Although this movie is family appropriate, it is definitely not a ""kid"" film, and strays totally away from the Disney/Pixar formula. No buddies, no musical numbers, no sidekicks or talking animals in sight.Instead, this a true superhero movie. The film is about a world that no longer wants superheroes. The existing superheroes are relocated under a something similar to the witness protection program and where our heroes go through midlife crisis and how their super family handles everyday life. Don't let the basic plot  fool you, there is plenty of action, suspense, humor, and even (gasp!) character development. This movie, as a superhero movie, blows away any superhero movie I have seen, and that includes the Spiderman and X-Men films. It keeps to the heart of comic heroes, serious when saving the world, but not too serious while living everyday life and keeping a sense of humor. Their problems are the problems of normal people, just magnified. Its an outstanding film in all respects, and gets my highest possible recommendation."	5.0	An Incredible Movie	2004-11-22	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ	Private Quentin Tarantino Fan	One thing I love about Pixar is the fact that they, lo and behold, do something different each time they make a movie.  Aside from the fact that Pixar adds as much for older people as it does for younger (as a matter of fact, I actually like Pixar more now than I did when I was younger), close inspection shows that they try new styles and new concepts each movie.  Pixar's The Incredibles is one of their most different, being a great action movie, an animation feast, a story that more often than not err, clicks with you, humor that's more than mere toilet humor, and another memorable cast of characters added to the already populated Pixar library of memorable characters.First off One of Pixar's benefits is using animation to create worlds unlike any other, and they did it so with The Incredibles despite the fact this movie could have been live action.  Besides, if they did it live action, this movie wouldn't look half as good as it does.  The animation is more simple compared to some of their other movies, but it's slick, sometimes simple comic book style (looks similar to Team Fortress, whatever style that's supposed to be) makes it's lounge-cool.  The use of Googie architecture is a big plus because I love that style, and slick effects and cool gadgets galore make their way into the world of the Incredibles.  Michael Giacchino's John Barry/caper-influenced score further adds to it's slickness.Incredibles once again gets some great voice talents (including Tarantino's most frequent collaborator.  Yes I had to say that), and the characters here are all glorious mash ups of different superheroes.  For example, Bob Parr is like a mix between The Thing and an actual person, and Elastigirl is another character that stretches like Plasticman.  Sure, none of them are that original, but there powers sure make for some sight gags, action sequences, and many situations that arise or feature the use of their natural powers (the bickering between the family during the dinner scene, for example).  All of these characters are likable, and while I don't feel they are as likable as some of Pixar's other movies (I wish there was a dog exactly like Dug), they still add for some very relatable situations.As for the villain himself Syndrome, I found him to be very interesting, reasonably ripped off at a young age but pitiful in his inability to forgive others to the point of extreme bitterness and plenty of sadistic tendencies.  He basically murders people by the thousands and the only way for him to get respect is to be a two-faced liar.  Even though he's loathsome, I think it's also a good cautionary tale for liking yourself and not idolizing others, because chances are the people who you idolize don't think of you as profound as you want them.  It's why I don't idolize anybody and am always my own main interest.It could be said that the superhero family is merely a gimmick for a movie that features satire that's painfully obvious.  But then again, it's enjoyable because it's straightforward satire, and nothing else.  No weird American Beauty-like symbolism and outlandish situations, just straightforward down to earth empty family life.  Kind of like Faces (John Cassavetes who most of you have probably never heard of) but the characters actually fix their family life and it ends on a much more positive note.  Those who complained about the ending being bright and cheery are stupid.  To me, that's called getting more out of life.I still don't exactly relate to everything here being that I'm not even in my 20's, but then again, thinking of what it's like to have a job you hate everyday and absolutely nothing different in your life is kind of depressing when you think about it.  What a hollow life.  It may not ring home with me as it does with the middle age people (Brad Bird himself based it off of his experience, so I don't think this movie was made to pander), but it's funny and understandable even to a person who doesn't have the full gist of what it's like to be middle age.But it's not an all serious all depressing movie by any stretch, The Incredibles is super fun and at times, super funny (no pun intended).  There are some very witty moments in here, the capes scene is classic, and I just love Edna Mode's gleeful passion of her costumes during the scene where she shows her new decided costumes, while Helen just stares with mixed feelings, having no idea how to react to something on display.  The concept of superheroes being sued is very clever, and this movie is, to sum it up short, fun.  Incredibles is great fun as an action movie, while not violent, but creative as well.For a PG movie, The Incredibles has some really entertaining action scenes, proving that you don't need gore and Bay style intensity to make a good action movie.  The Incredibles delivers great action sequences, creative and varied, even topped off with sound design that was rightfully awarded at The Academy Awards.  I'd even go this far and say if you put a gun to my head and asked me to pick either the Incredibles, Sin City, and 300 for action, I would easily pick the Incredibles.  I love both of those movies,  but the Incredibles really has some of the most entertaining, creative, and even easy to follow action sequences in recent memory.This is the last DVD of a Pixar movie that features loads and loads of delightfully entertaining special features that surely gets the most out of your DVD experience.  Then Cars was released and it all went to consumer hell, charging a whole extra DVD for _________ Spanish version alone.  Cheap ____________.  Never mind my rant.  Incredibles is not quite incredible, but it's still yet another winner from Pixar.  Cliched to say so?  Maybe.  However, one thing is for sure, Pixar keeps on showing that they know how to entertain audiences in the best ways possible for the best ways possible.	4.0	Pixar Proves There the best in the business	2010-01-05	1	1	0

THE INCREDIBLES is a fantastic amagalm of James Bond, Indiana Jones, Predator, Spider Man, and the Jetsons. The humor is brilliant, the animation is spectacular, the script is witty and sharp, the plot is engaging and suspenseful, and the emotional payoff is very satisfying.The vocal talent, particularly from Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter, is stellar...you really empathize with these characters and forget that they are not actually ""real."" The premise--superheroes trying to live ""normal"" lives after being sued for saving lives--is delightfully droll. There is a bit of intense action here, which is where the PG rating comes in. However, most children above the age of 10 should be able to handle it, and they will love the film...as will their parents.The look of the film on this DVD set is very crisp and bright; yet, it's also warm and the colors sizzle.  Audio-wise, it's a sonic boom...a rich, full, clean sound that roars like a rocket ride.  And, this set is loaded with extras, including the usual commentary and ""making-of's"" plus some dynamite new feature shorts; the rip-roaring ""Jack-Jack Attack"" is a treasure.  It's all done in the same snappy, smart comedic mode that makes the feature itself so excellent.Grab a bucket of popcorn, nestle on a comfy couch, and enjoy...this is what movies are all about."	5.0	Incredibly entertaining	2005-09-23	2	1	1

The people at Pixar have succeeded again in making a unique movie that is entertaining for both kids as well as adults.Director Brad Bird (who also directed WB's `The Iron Giant' which is another amazing movie!) tells us the story of Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible), a superhero who is forced to give up using his powers and live a boring ordinary life (after litigations are made for any superhero from using his/her powers in public). However, things change when he gets a mysterious call from a secret agency requesting his help to sabotage a machine that has gone insane. Little does he realize that the person, who he is working for, is his worst enemy, and soon gets into trouble for it, for which his family (who also has unique super powers) has to come to save him. Will they succeed in destroying their nemesis? Will they be accepted as superheroes again?Combining various elements of various superheroes like The Fantastic Four and X-Men, this amusing story provides us with adventure (an immediate scene that comes to mind is when Dash and Violet try to save themselves in the jungle), comedy (the character of Edna Mode was hilarious!), suspense and a moral, which is basically what everyone looks for in a good movie. The special effects and CGI for this movie is amazing. I couldn't believe that some scenes were actually computer animated because they seemed so real! Hey, the CGI is not enough though; the voices provided for the characters, from a talented cast such as Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Jason Lee and Samuel L. Jackson, are, forgive my pun, `incredible' and make they characters really believable!All in all, this movie has a little of something for everyone, and is worth watching at least once!	5.0	An ingenious movie!!	2004-11-09	59	50	9

The giant robot is identical to the one in Saber Marionette R. There are more examples but these stick out most to me. Other then that it's a very captivating movie and what's more, its adult. The beginning drags slightly, but we get to know the characters and when the action finally starts it doesn't let up. I was on the edge of my seat. The cgi is flawless but I prefer the more 'human' design of the characters from shrek 2 rather then the caricature-ish design presented here.

Toy Story and Shrek were among my favorite movies when I was young, but I strongly feel that The Incredibles fails to live up that expectation.First, the voice acting is outrageous. The mom has a really distracting lisp and the father is a monotone. The scene with Frozone getting a drink of water becuase he's ""thirsty"" is THE most retarded scene I have ever scene in the history of cinema. Like a robber would just casually get a drink while he's at gunpoint...Also, Violet scares me... The only good voice acting is done by the director in his performance as Etna.Secondly, The Incredibles is pretty much an animated version of The Fantastic Four with Iceman in the sense that they have the same powers as them. I would've really liked to see some new stuff because frankly, I'm getting tired of the same superheros.Thirdly, the story really suffers and feels really rushed at some points and really slow at others. I honestly don't know what that was about.I'd honestly say the only redeeming qualities of this movie are the UNBELEIVABLE computer animation that makes it look REAL. Also, the soundtrack (played mostly by Gordon Goodwin's band :]) fits right in."	2.0	Fails to Meet the Standards	2006-08-28	22	4	18
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3W13VVBRY5GL7	"Review Lover ""ReviewLover"""	'The Incredibles' does Pixar's creative team proud once more, blending literally jaw-dropping CGI animations with excellent voice talent, huge production values, a hefty dose of humour, and most importantly, an excellent storyline.Blacklisted and in a Hero Protection Programme, because of a legal loophole that allows Superheroes to be sued, the Parr family appears to be, at least to the casual observer, an average, traditional family of suburbanites. Dad works in Insurance, Mom stays at home with the kids. Normalcy being relative, however, frustrated father Bob accepts an invitation from the mysterious 'Mirage' to help her tame a wild robot, thus resuming his activities as the superhero Mr. Incredible.And in the grand traditions of dual identities, action and adventure, and double-crossings, the Parr family is caught up in a plot to exterminate all Do-Gooders.The animation is beautiful - super-deformed characters move with a grace and fluidity that makes their cartoony world believable, and water and flame effects surpass even those seen in 'Finding Nemo'. The direction, too, is superlative - who can say what the latter 'Batman' movies might have been if they'd had this sort of creative impetus behind the camera?Vocal talent comes in the shape of Craig T. Nelson as lovable and impulsive Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as his frustrated wife Elastigirl, and Brad Bird's absolutely hilarious turn as superhero designer-turned-couturier Edna Mode is some of the best characterisation Pixar's ever given us.With such wonderful source material as this, a movie of a lesser storyline could have been catapulted into the ranks of animation greats, but thankfully Pixar scores on this front, too, and via a series of quirky events and clever, more mature themes (legal battles and infidelity - albeit very suitable for kids), 'The Incredibles' may well be even more appealing to the parents of the children it's been designed for.I can't recommend it highly enough.	5.0	One of Pixar's Best Ever!	2004-12-03	1	0	1

I don't normally do this, unless it is the latest Spielberg movie coming out....but this movie is just a little different.Yes, I liked the movie...but not for the old reasons (Witty dialog, check....smart script, check....good character development, check...etc, etc).  It had all these, but it also had something that I hardly noticed was gone from today's movies.The reason I so liked this movie was the idea of family, and how the writer of this movie envisons how a family should be.  Sure, the kids bicker.  Sure, the husbands and wives don't see eye to eye on everything (When you hear the line, ""Honey, where's my Supersuit?"" You'll just know it was written by someone who has been married).  But they all like each other.  They are suportive of each other.  Too many movies and TV shows don't show this anymore.OK, I'm old fashioned.  But I'm sure that raising a child in these times makes many fathers long for the good ol' days.  Quite simply, this is a movie that you can pop into the DVD player and enjoy with the whole family.  There's enough humor for the adults, and plenty of action for the kids.  And there is nothing that I saw or heard that made me squirm with the thought, ""Boy, I hope the little one doesn't ask what THAT means.""The casting is great...hearing Coach (Craig T Nelson) as the Dad, and Holly Hunter as his wife...they just worked perfectly together (Choosing the correct exit is a scene I replayed a few times in my head...hilarious).

This is cute and really funny in spots.  The problem I have is this film is too long.  The middle sags with very little action and it gets a little boring.

Seemed to me to be an attempt by Disney/Pixar to cash in on all the superhero hype surrounding recent films such as Spider-Man, Hulk, Daredevil, etc. But this movie surprised me. It was highly entertaining!The beginning of the movie has a short animated film typical of Pixar films. This one is about a lamb who gets sheared every year but manages to keep his chin up with the advice of a Jack-A-Roo! Fun. There is also the new Star Wars Episode III trailer at the beginning. 'Rise Lord Vader'. Cool. Only thing missing was the Elektra preview which had been rumoured to be there.The Incredibles is strikingly similar to Marvel's Fantastic Four. Strength, elasticity, invisibility, with only the human torch missing, but replaced with a super speedy Dash. The animation is great! The characters are great! The story is great! I particularly liked the costume designer Edna Mode with her style and lecturing about why capes are not good. The ending is funny with Dash finally allowed by his parents to participate in school sports and he gets caught up in the excitement by his cheering family that he forgets he needs to hold back and then slows down to purposely finish in 2nd place!So many great moments in this film and likeable characters, you'll be disappointed that the movie has to end!

Nelson from ""Coach"" and his chemistry with Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson or Skippy here, ""Who is not affiliated with me!"" Besides his incredible obesity developed after 15 years of undercover work and listening to the police scanners just made the film great. In addition, Disney included adorable children whom the animators carefully displayed familial features plus ""Edna"" a.k.a. E.

J Rey	"The creators of ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo"" look into the lives of a typical family of superheroes in the fantastic animated blockbuster ""The Incredibles"". After a series of unfortunate lawsuits, the mighty champion Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has retired to a simple suburban existence with his devoted wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and his super powered children but still longs for his old days of glory. When the mad inventor Syndrome (Jason Lee) seeks revenge on Mr. Incredible and other superheroes, this amazing family unites to save the day. Directed by Brad Bird (The Iron Giant), Pixar's latest CG release is an entertaining mix of rousing comic book adventure and heartfelt family comedy. Its clever storyline is certainly amusing. ""The Incredibles"" contains some great humor, enormous excitement, stunning CG animation and memorable characters like eccentric fashion designer Edna Mode. The 2004 computer-animated film also features the voice talents of Samuel L. Jackson as super cool hero Frozone.Disney continues to deliver first-rate DVD quality with the release of ""The Incredibles"" Collector's Edition. Pixar's latest animated smash hit is presented in its original theatrical widescreen format. The DVD has a razor-sharp video transfer with rich detailed colors and flawless sharpness. Its aggressive Dolby Digital 5.1-EX sound is truly excellent. Among special features, this fully-loaded edition includes two audio commentaries with director Brad Bird and production crew, several deleted scenes, an alternate opening, fun outtakes, an informative ""Making of The Incredibles"" featurette and the amusing ""Jack-Jack Attack"" animated short. Overall, ""The Incredibles"" is an exceptional DVD and scores a worthy ""A""."	5.0	Incredible Achievement	2005-03-10	3	2	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AX3WJZLFQQRCT	"R. M. Ettinger ""rme1963"""	"Overall 'The Incredibles' is a really good movie. It's not typical Pixar - it is human character based and has a true action storyline.  As with most of Pixar movies, the CG is pretty good and the casting is well above average.  Holly Hunter was perfect for Elastigirl.  But Craig T. Nelson, Sarah Vowel and Wallace Shawn do very good jobs too.But the story is the driving feature that would make for a great live action movie - though couldn't be done without looking too much like `Spy Kids'.  The CG makes it more on par with something like a James Bond/Raiders of the Lost Ark adventure.  Even the music is very Bond-like.  My only issue was that at the beginning of the movie the animation seemed to not sequence with the dialogue.  It definitely got better as the movie went along.  As always, there are elements for both younger and older audiences.  It's not for the `Finding Nemo' young young audience. It could have too many explosions and too much gunfire for young kids.There are lots of extras. ""Jack Jack Attack"" is what I would have called deleted scenes.  It could have blended into the original movie wonderfully, but would have forced a different ending. Deleted Scenes is actually unused storyboarded items that never made it to CG development or into the movie.  Some of them were very interesting, but explanations by Brad Bird let you know why they didn't make the cut.Sarah Vowel can be extremely hilarious on NPR's `This American Life', but her essay on the special DVD doesn't translate as well.Extras can be a nice feature, but rarely do they ever add to a DVD release - this is no exception.  If you get `The Incredibles' it should be for the original movie.  It's worth it."	4.0	Good Story  Good Movie	2005-03-19	1	0	1

The storyline is great, characters are wonderful, comedic timing is perfect - and there's no cheezy musical interludes you'll find in every other Disney movie.In fact, this hardly seems like a children's movie at all. It has a PG-rating, which means the action and storyline is more exciting than something you'd find in a G-rated movie.This is a double-disc DVD set and they've really tried to include as many extras as possible. The Behind-the-Scenes footage was a little disappointing (mostly Brad Bird cracking his crew up or arguing with other producers) - I had hoped for some more in-depth footage of actually animating the film, whereas this is more of how the film was ""produced"" and ""managed"".This is something worth owning."	5.0	Fun Movie!	2005-04-15	2	1	1

It is terrific, deserved the Oscar and featured particularly high quality voice-work.  Craig T. Nelson was a blast, Samuel Jackson was clearly charged up, Holly Hunter shows her funny side, and creator Brad Bird is terrific as Edna.  The visuals are typically stunning, groundbreaking work from Pixar.  The glossy '50s era sensibilities mixed with modern is just perfect for computer generated films.  Pixar, better than anyone, seems to develop stories that just suit the form...remember how perfect TOY STORY seemed?!Anyway, I recommend the DVD highly not just because it's a movie kids and adults can enjoy time and again, but because it's got some terrific extras.  I haven't watched every single one yet, but just the few I've seen were worth numerous laughs.  The bonus short film, Jack-Jack Attack, while only 4.5 minutes long, is very frantic and funny...it reminded me of the Roger Rabbit ""cartoons"".  And BOUNDIN', the delightful short that played prior to the movie during its theatrical release is a joy, particularly for youngsters.  It's the kind of little film that just lifts your spirits right away...it's fluff of the best kind!I also enjoyed the fake cartoon.  The premise is that in the '60s, before the superheroes were banned by the government, there was going to be an animated TV show about the Incredibles, starring Mr. Incredible, Frozone and a very annoying rabbit named Skipperdoo.  The cartoon you can ""enjoy"" on its own...it's about 4 minutes long, and is just about the worst thing you could hope to see.  Almost no animation, with the ""talking"" provided by real lips moving behind the animated figure.  Kinda creepy, really cheesy!!  But endure the cartoon, because then you should watch it with the ""commentary"" provided by the ""real"" Frozone and Mr. Incredible.  It's pretty darn funny!!Other bits are fun too, and I'm sure the making of featurette will be of interest.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	The Incredibles (Brad Bird, 2004)The Incredibles is a fun little film when you watch it; interesting, kind of engaging, but nothing terribly special; it's doesn't reach out and grab hold of your throat and slap you around the room with its greatness the way Monsters, Inc. does. It's only later, when you've reflected on the little details for a while, that you come to realize how much of this film is simply, as the kids say these days, made of awesome.Bird, one of the better directors in the Pixar stable, filled this sucker chock-full of fun in-jokes for the adults whilst keeping the action coming for the kiddies. In this installment of the great Pixar dynasty, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has been forced into retirement after a rescue gone terribly wrong in the opening scenes. Mundane life is, shall we say, not treating him terribly well. He and his wife, the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), have moved to the suburbs and are trying to raise their family-- all of whom, as it turns out, seem to have inherited superpowers from their parents-- in relative obscurity. The most superhero-like thing Mr. Incredible does is get together with his old pal Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) and talk over old times. Until, that is, he receives a secret message saying that his powers are needed...It's a fun movie, the kind of thing you expect from Pixar-- lots of action, witty dialogue, visual gags, a good time to be had by all. You'll enjoy it. But then, go and read the trivia page over at IMDB and marvel at the number of in-jokes in this movie. There are homages to what seems like every superhero comic, every movie any of these actors has ever worked in, every member of the crew. And none of them interferes with the movie's plot or pacing. That's brilliant. Either Bird is the world's biggest geek and had this entire thing cast before he started writing, or his eye for detail is unparalleled. (Or both.) It's the technical equivalent of the emotional punch of Monsters, Inc., and what makes it great is trying to think of another studio that could have cranked those two movies out back-to-back-- and not being able to come up with one. ****	4.0	Pixar bats another one out of the park.	2007-02-27	2	2	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"First I do have to point out that the editorial reviewer, Doug Thomas, started his review with an absurd statement by insisting that Brad Bird's THE IRON GIANT was the last great traditional animated film.  Has Mr. Thomas not heard of Hayao Miyazaki, whose SPIRITED AWAY was released in Japan in 2001, a full two years after THE IRON GIANT in 1999.  I absolutely loved THE IRON GIANT, but while Brad Bird certainly has done well in making animated films, Miyazaki still is widely regarded as the greatest feature length animator of all time.  I think what Mr. Thomas meant to say was that THE IRON GIANT was the last great American traditional animated film.I was slow in seeing THE INCREDIBLES for a simple reason:  four or five people had told me that they thought it was awful.  Beware of friends bringing you advice!  I still love them all, but after having seen this my question is:  What were they thinking of?  This was just a super, super film, taking a variety of established genres and taking them to the next level.  Furthermore, it took the possibilities inherent in computer animation and stretched it further than any previous film has done.  For instance, the long scene in which Dash Parr speeds through the forest is breathtaking, showing us things that are impossible using real actors (even THE FLASH, when it comes out, will almost certainly substitute CGI for the actor), but doing so in a way that never really called attention to the technical sophistication of the scene.What I have loved about all of the Pixar productions has been their persistent attention to quality characters.  The story in this film is not bad, but where it excels is in the creation and delineation of great characters.  The Parrs, though computer generated, really doo seem like a family, or at least as much a family as those in most situation comedies or family dramas.  I thought the way the individual characters were ""drawn"" was particularly inspired, from Bob with his miniscule legs and gargantuan torso, to the ultra-slender Helen, and Edna (who bears a striking resemblence to Edith Head).  And the voice acting was great!  Too often actors who are not particularly well suited for particular roles are cast in animated films, but the casting here was absolutely inspired.  I would never in a trillion years have thought of Craig Nelson for Bob Parr, but he really brought him to life.  It is no surprise that Holly Hunter did the same for Helen, but their choosing Sarah Vowell (best known for her history-buff books like PARTLY CLOUDLY PATRIOT and ASSASINATION VACATION and for her involvement with NPR's ""This American Life"") was absolutely inspired.  She has a spectacularly unique voice, and was perfect for making Violet seem believable. Samuel L. Jackson is great as Frozone, but that is a given.  Wallace Shawn was perfect for Bob's boss Gilbert Huph, who is also one of the truly creepy characters in computer animated film.The score was way above average for this kind of film, and obviously a great deal of trouble was taken over it.  Michael Giacchino's work is familiar to anyone who has seen ALIAS or LOST, but while on those shows he works largely a la Mark Snow almost entirely with synthesizers, for THE INCREDIBLES he went with a big, brassy jazz orchestra, and this really gives the whole production a James Bond kind of sound.I really recommend this one in a big way.  And it taught me a lesson:  you can't always count on your friends in matters of taste."	5.0	Brad Bird and Pixar both score huge hits in this fine film	2005-04-17	6	4	2

Then one day, one of my monitors was not connected and I decided to watch a Disney Digital film and it played.  Presto, I realized later on that when I have both monitors connected to my graphics card Disney has fixed so that you and I cannot watch the digital movie, we paid big bucks for, on two monitors at the same time via your computer.  I have many other digital movies from Universal, Warner etc. and they all play whether or not I have one or two monitors plugged into my graphics card.So beware.  If you have Disney digital movies on your computer and you have a dual-monitor graphics card and say one day you and your family decide to watch Snow White but you and your wife want to watch it in the bedroom and the kids in their room--forget it--it's not going to happen.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"The animated hit ""The Incredibles"" is a parody of superhero and James Bond movies sprinkled with cynical helpings of ""Leave it to Beaver"" and ""Father Knows Best.""  This seems an odd sort of hybrid until one realizes that The Incredibles are really a crime-busting family made up of a dad named Bob (actually Mr. Incredible), a mom named Helen (aka Elastigirl), a daughter named Violet, and a son named Dash, each of whom comes equipped with his or her own superhero specialty.As the movie opens, we see the family in full fighting regalia, battling criminals, rescuing the innocent, and earning accolades from the city's grateful citizenry.  However, even a superhero isn't immune from the excesses of an overly-litigious society, and soon more and more of these superhero crime fighters begin to fall victim to law suits and out-of-court settlements.  As a result, not only the Incredibles, but all the known superheroes are forced to withdraw from society, being sent to faraway corners to live out their lives in a sort of witness-protection-program-type anonymity.  Safely ensconced in their suburban sanctuary, Helen wants the family to adopt a ""normal"" lifestyle, hidden away from the prying eyes of a judgmental society, but Bob is a superhero to the core and he cannot endure the stifling existence imposed on him by suburban domesticity.  Thus, he spends most of his time sneaking around behind his wife's back, saving the world on his off-hours.  When Paul finds himself in a spot from which even the great Mr. Incredible is not able to extricate himself, it's Helen and the kiddies to the rescue and the adventure really begins.Although the humor in ""The Incredibles"" isn't as free-ranging and eclectic as it is in, say, the ""Toy Story"" or ""Shrek"" movies, the film still manages to generate a goodly number of laughs, primarily through the clever domestication of its superhero figures.  Amidst all their battles with evil forces, the family still finds time for marital squabbles and sibling rivalry.  But, rest assured, the time-honored themes of family unity and being true to oneself get plenty of play as well.There's first rate voiceover work from Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Wallace Shawn et. al.  But there's none better than Brad Bird (who also wrote and directed the film) as Edna `E' Mode, a hilarious takeoff on elitist fashion designers who makes an indelible mark in the few scenes she's in.  The film does suffer a bit from over length and the problem most action-oriented films have of loading on the special effects in the action scenes to the point where the characters and storyline tend to get lost in the shuffle.  But that deficiency is more than made up for in the beautifully streamlined, high-tech look of the film which seems both state-of-the-art modern and a little bit retro at one and the same time.""The Incredibles"" is a little less ingenious than the ""Shrek"" movies, but it has a beauty and charm all its own."	4.0	gorgeous animated adventure	2005-05-02	6	3	3

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"""Incredibles"" works on so many levels - it's both an adventure and a parody of adventures, with Pixar's famed animation being capable of seamlessly jumping from one extreme to the other, and bringing out the high-points in each.When ""The Incredibles"" opens, superheroes are already a commonplace occurrence.  Identities are secret, but heroes seem to keep them only for buying groceries, and remain perfectly at home when masked, flying and crime-fighting.  Unfortunately, the world is too comfy with heroes, and cavalierly finds itself needing their assistance.  When a spate of lawsuits proves too much for Mr. Incredible himself (Craig T. Nelson) to handle, he and other heroes are placed into a witness-protection program for ex-crime fighters.  Already married to Elasti-Girl (Holly Hunter) Mr. Incredible settles reluctantly into assumed suburban living (dead-end job working for an insurance company; ridiculous car; NO crime fighting), father's some kids and hangs up his suit.  Never forgetting his past glory days, or that they are in fact in his past, Incredible chomps at the bit for a chance to return.  He gets it when a mysterious beautiful woman offers him a ridiculous sum of money to help contain her latest invention - an agressive robot that, among other things, can learn from its mistakes and those of its enemies.  After a trip to the island of the robot's mysterious creator, Incredible learns a darker secret, one that will force him to enlist the aid of his wife and two of their three super-powered children.First off, does anybody remember the 80's comic ""Watchmen""?  For those who have, the surprise is how much of that dark and mean-spirited comic novel has found its way into a fim that is completely unlike it in tone.  ""Incredibles"" is fun - though its loud and fast, and has some CGI relared viokence and may otheriwse scare some younger viewers (mine sat through the whole thing w/o problem).  With its Pixar-aniamted world, this is a story that can pick and choose when it will thrill or just go for the easy laugh.  Either way it goes, I cam out of this movie seeing something I hadn't seen in a while - a standing ovation."	5.0	Excellent adventure/comedy	2004-11-07	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A28I2XHC63LG8D	"RSF ""Rob"""	Above all else, this film has STYLE.The characters, score, animation, story, and everything else that went into the production of this film were all done exceedingly well.  I just can't recommend it enough!That being said, I am also a parent and feel I should offer the following caveat:I brought my son (age 2) to see this in the theatre and he was ENTHRALLED by it.  It is rated PG, and after seeing the film I did have a tinge of regret about him viewing it.  There are bullets and whatnot, but the PG tag should alert you to the comic violence. However, there were several tactful allusions to death (gotta watch those capes), and more importantly the associated loss that comes with death of a friend and loved one.  Since that can be a difficult topic to discuss I thought a slight warning was in order in my review.As an avid animation fan, I humbly thank Pixar for this masterful work.  Also, if you haven't seen Brad Bird's other film, The Iron Giant, you should.	5.0	Brad Bird has done it again!	2005-01-21	3	1	2

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3AKPY4LXIC24O	Ryan Costantino	Did you ever read comic books as a kid?  Did you ever wish you had super powers?  If you answered yes drop everything and go see this movie now.  I have been increasingly blown away by the quality filmmaking Pixar has brought to cinemas over the past decade, but The Incredibles marks the first time I've been overwhelmed.  Everything you've ever loved about superheroes is addressed in this film, from secret identities to the danger of wearing a cape.  Add to the mix an amazingly complex family drama and you have the absolute best film of the year.Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), once the super hero of the year is now relegated to a cubicle in an insurance company, still trying to save the day (quietly) one claim at a time.  His wife, Helen, a.k.a Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) has also turned in her spandex, using her special powers to juggle the task of raising three kids instead of wrangling villains.  Their son, Dash, wants nothing more than to use his super speed to propel him to athletic glory. Violet, who has the ability to turn invisible and enclose her self within a forcefield broods like any normal teenager.  The baby, Jack Jack doesn't seem to have any super powers at all, unless you include making funny faces in a high chair.All of this is due to a Super Hero relocation program enacted by the government after public outcry over property damage and personal injury( a very sharp and poignant jab at our own litigious nature).  Forced to hide greatness behind a shroud of mediocrity the Incredible family do their best to blend in with normal society, and for the most part succeed.Of course events unfold to bring all of the Incredibles super powers to light, and for this to occur you need to introduce the mad genius villain, Syndrome (Jason Lee).  Parents, here's where the PG rating comes from, because this is one really, really bad guy.  A former superhero fan with an enormous chip on his shoulder Syndrome is like every James Bond baddie rolled into one.  His gadgets are unique, insanely cool, and above all extremely deadly.  Some dark thematic elements and violence cemented the MPAA's decision to slap Pixar with its first above G rating.  However, this movie could not have been done properly without giving the audience such a nefarious nemesis to loathe.In costume and out you will constantly root for the Incredibles, this movie is what going to the theater is all about, non-stop entertainment.  The action sequences are positively synapse blowing.  The script is Oscar worthy in its ability to seamlessly weave domestic drama and comic book daring-do.  Of course the animation has to be seen to be believed, and your eyes will bulge for the film's duration.I can't imagine this film not being successful but I hope it destroys box office records and mends the wound that has Pixar and Disney going their separate ways.  Because if ever there was a film that demanded a sequel it is The Incredibles.  An animation masterpiece!	5.0	Incredibly Incredible, Awesomely Awesome, Perfectly Perfect	2004-11-05	226	201	25

It's not as exhaustive as something like Digital Video Essentials, but it provides many of the same tests and is easier to use and understand.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1B9RL9DGJ97NE	Ryne Williams	Shrek 2 is the sequel to the 2001 blockbuster. Probably asked to tone down due to the popularity from small children it is not as crass and crude as the original but this movie, however without the cursing and sexual jibes is charming and is a slight improvement. This time around Shrek is faced with a different kind of insumountable problem, which is meeting Fiona's parents. Along the way Shrek meets a pint sized hit man, Puss in Boots which is the best addition to the series. The entire cast returns and for the sequel John Cleese, Julie Andrews, and Antonio Banderes have joined on. The computer generated effects are greatly improved and thankfully are not as harsh as the original Shrek's. The characters are more likable since we have come to know them since their arrival, and the story (even though it is basically the same as the original) works better the second time around.Shrek 2 is charming and visually pleasing. It will be a children's movie that will be remembered, and the characters of Shrek will continue to be pop culture icons of the 21st Century. I recommend this to any fan of the series or people who enjoy the genre or parodies in general.	4.0	A Rarity In Sequels	2005-03-21	9	2	7

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AMTC1GMV6DGX4	"Sam Middleton ""Sam"""	The Incredibles would have to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.Bob Parr aka Mr. Incredible is one of the greatest super heroes around. He saves lives, stops burglaries and is an all-round a great super hero. But one day he gets sued for saving someone's life. Now Bob is just an average guy working for an insurance company with a wife aka Elastegirl, A daughter named Violet, and 2 sons named Dash and Jack-Jack. Violet and Dash have powers of their own but Jack-Jack seems to have missed out in the powers department. Bob is unhappy with his mediocre life and wants to be a hero again and gets his chance when he is called to a remote island to sort something out for an unknown company. Things basically kick off from there.Out of all the characters Dash would have to be my favorite character because some of the things he said just cracked me up and he has a very cool power, super speed is definitely a power that I would want.The animation in the film is top class but we can't really expect any less from the crew at Pixar who is easily the best at making animation movies.	5.0	Top Class Animation Film	2005-01-19	3	2	1

I especially resent stories that are not interesting and/or appropriate for children that are given the superficial makeover in which the characters are replaced by animals.  They still talk like humans, wear human clothes, have human concerns, even propagate tired cultural stereotypes (Shark Tale, anyone?).  So it was a relief to find that the characters were (super-)human.Having said that, I found The Incredibles to be quite entertaining.  The ""good guys"" had flaws, and the ""bad guy"" had a good back-story rather than just being inexplicably pure evil.  Nuance!

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AQB7YI20ZGNMR	Sarah	Most of us have high expectations for Pixar studios after the amazing movies they have given us. When I first saw the preview for The Incredibles when it was just the overweight man in his supersuit I immediately didn't like it. The character in my eyes was not the next Buzz Lightyear or Mike Wizowski.The movie is clever in the beginning but the characters are underdeveloped and the story is not that exciting. There are a few times where you chuckle, but not laugh like laugh out louds in other Pixar films.The movie is good, I think it's great for a night to rent if you haven't seen it before. However, I do not think it is a good buy on DVD because it simply doesn't have enough to capture you and make you want to see it again.	3.0	Good.... but not 'Incredible'	2005-02-22	43	8	35

Well, perhaps they have retired into normal lives with normal families.  Perhaps.Not long after Mr. Incredible marries Elastigirl, a mountain of lawsuits pile up against all the super heroes from the destruction they leave behind while saving the world and the people who inhabit it.  Forced into retirement, the Incredibles settle down to lead a normal life, working normal jobs and raising their children.Well, while their jobs may be normal, their children are not.  Violet has invisibility and force field capability, and Dash had super speed powers.  Only baby Jack-Jack appears to be without superpowers.Bob Parr (a.k.a. Mr. Incredible) is extremely unhappy with his boring bank job, and often gets together with his best friend, Lucius Best (a.k.a. Frozone) to secretly fight crime.  When the beautiful Mirage spies on them and discovers their identity, she sends a proposal to Mr. Incredible that is too good for him to refuse.Bob hides his new ""career"" from his wife Helen (a.k.a. Elastigirl), though Helen notices Bob's happy new attitude and obvious weight loss.  Until the day she discovers Mr. Incredible's newly mended suit and her suspicions lead her to chase him down to a small volcanic island.It is here that things begin to go awry for the Incredibles, and when Helen discovers that Dash and Violet have stowed away on her plane as she flies off to confront her husband, the hilarious events become a family affair.The Incredibles is not just a kid's movie, it's great for the entire family.  I thought at first it would be too tame and too lame to watch, but I was delightfully surprised to discover how captivating and well done the movie is.  Don't be afraid to pick it up and watch it, the humor is sharp and witty and the plot is clever and absorbing.  Trust me, my kids are all grown and I bought this movie strictly for myself.Look for great performances from voice actors Samuel Jackson, Elizabeth Pena, Wallace Shawn, Craig T. Nelson, and Holly Hunter.  Highly entertaining with a hilarious ending, The Incredibles is a movie everyone can love.  Enjoy!"	5.0	Much better than the blurbs led me to believe	2005-05-12	4	3	1

Thinking back on Toy Story, Toy Story II, A Bugs' Life, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, each one is unique, unrelated to anything we've seen before, joyeously satisfying. Incredibles may be their best movie to date. There's something for every age, and it's clever, charming, touching. I laughed throughout. There was so much detail I want to see it again and again.I'm a fan of the James Bond adventures and comic book heros, and this movie takes plenty of ammunition from these, while adding new ideas to each.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"Brad Bird's ""The Incredibles"" serves up additional proof (as if any was needed) that the good folks at Pixar are the most consistent filmmaking team in the business.  While much of the Pixar filmography is aimed at the younger set (albeit with plenty of goodies for the adults to delight in, too), ""The Incredibles"" is a definite turn toward a more mature audience.The plot of ""The Incredibles"" is well-known -- a family of superheroes are denied the right to exercise their talents by our litigious society -- the ""supers'"" fall from grace is the subject of a wonderful opening sequence.  Placed in a superhero-relocation program (as the Parr family, appropriately enough), the ""supers"" chafe at their imposed restrictions -- one of the strongest themes of the movie is the undeniable power of a person's need to achieve their full potential.Stuck in a cubicle in suburbia, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) jumps at the resume his former superhero identity on the sly . . . a plot that leads him into a potential (and apparent) affair as well as a clash with Syndrome (Jason Lee), a mad scientist-superhero hybrid from Mr. Incredible's past.Soon the rest of the Parrs are on the hunt to save their captured patriarch.  Mrs. Parr, aka Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and her tots, Dash and Violet risk death and dismemberment (in some amazing chase scenes sure to inspire a heck of a video game) as they seek to save dear old dad.  Their quest takes them from a tropical island to the streets of the Big City where Syndrome unleashes the ultimate killer robot.  Allied with old chum Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), the Incredibles put up a tremendous fight against Syndrome and his colossus - a delight for fans of all ages.For parents of tykes, be warned that this movie is a bit more mature than ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Toy Story,"" and other Pixar fare.  There is a sub-plot involving possible marital infidelity, although it doesn't go very deep in exploring this, and it's undeniable that Mr. Incredible adores Elastigirl, and vice versa.  Many of Syndrome's anonymous henchmen obviously die in high-speed chases (their cool flying vehicles crash in blazing glory, leaving their grim fate pretty obvious), and Syndrome is a lethal opponent of the ""supers.""  This is a bit dark for some youngsters and parents may have some 'splainin' to do to their younger kids, so be warned -- don't pop in this DVD just 'cause it says ""Pixar"" and presume that no child will be a bit frightened.  Most kids will absolutely adore this movie, of course, as will most adults.The extras on this DVD are wonderful - two animated shorts, ""Boundin',"" which is an enchanting poem about a vain sheep and a wise jackalope, as well as a snippet of a parallel story from the movie involving a hilarious babysitter are sure to delight. There's even a silly retro-cartoon featuring Mr. Incredible and Frozone in more ""primitive"" times, and this extra is even more enjoyable when the commentary track is employed. There are no ""out-takes"" that I could find, which was a disappointment, but all things considered this is an excellent DVD for a wonderful family film."	5.0	"Amazing, Hilarious Super-Hero Tale -- ""PG,"" not ""G"""	2005-04-12	2	1	1

For a more exciting adventure, watch ""National Treasure"" on DVD. I believe ""The Incredibles"" deserves at least four stars."	4.0	I only liked the action sequences...	2005-07-24	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1IMNNBC4ME0NB	ShamayimBlue	"I don't even know where to begin.  This movie is funny, creative, and sends a powerful message not only about the importance of family bonds but also about the importance of developing one's individual talents.After years of serving the world, the Supers (people with extraordinary powers) are hounded by the public and become subjects of various law suits.  They retire to lives of dreary anonymity.  Among them is Mr. Incredible, now known only as Bob Parr, a tired, overweight man working for a soulless insurance company.  His wife is the former Elastigirl, and their kids, as it turns out, were born with powers that they have to suppress to fit in with their more average classmates.Watch the movie to see how this family comes to embrace who they really are and rise against not only dastardly villains but the crushing force of mediocrity in society and the mentality of ""everyone's a winner"", in which real merit takes second place to making people feel good."	5.0	Marvelous entertainment	2005-08-13	1	1	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3VNPPZFGXO4DI	Shampoo Mohawk27	"In ""The Incredibles"", Mr. Incredible wants to relive his glory days because he and Frozone listen to police scanners and because he accepts Mirage's secret message. Furthermore, he has his super suit on in the end of the film, which clearly shows both his determination to once more become a super and his desire to relive the old glory days.I watched this film many times and I never got tired of it. Every time you view it you see something new-something you would have never thought computers could do. ""The  Incredibles"" is a computer animated film by Pixar about a retired super hero family living normal lives. They have average jobs and the children go to public school. Their powers aren't revealed to anyone but family.Mr. Incredible is married to another super (one who has a super ability) named Elastigirl. They have a family together with 3 kids, all with their own special abilities. Though the parents believe that their youngest child has no powers, in actuality he does. Unfortunately they don't use their powers but instead they live mundane lives. However, Mr. Incredible is bored out of his mind with his average life and he wants to relive his glory days. Those days consist of saving the town's people from criminals committing crimes and getting praise from the town.Mr. Incredible spends his Wednesday nights with a fellow retired super named Frozone. They lie to their families and say they are going out to play bowling. But instead they listen to police scanners and wait for some local problems to arise and fix. Once they hear of a problem they put on masks and go hurry to the specific site. When they get there they play super hero and save the day. This act of rescue clearly shows that Mr. Incredible misses his super hero life.Mr. Incredible also shows his longing for the old days by accepting these secret missions from Mirage. She is one of the few who knows that he is a super. She asks him to stop this big machine that went out of control on this deserted island. He gladly accepts the challenge from Mirage and thinks of this as an opportunity to enjoy life and become a super again. And so he flies to an isolated island to stop this monstrous machine. He successfully accomplishes this difficult task and then continues on accepting more missions that Mirage offers him.  He soon feels like a super again and enjoys life like it was back in the glory days.Furthermore, at the end of the film Mr. Incredible has his super suit on under his regular attire. This new enemy arises at the end of the film and Mr. Incredible and his family are prepared with their masks and suits on ready to take on whoever is there to disturb the peace. They now are not hiding their powers but instead are using them to help the city. The glory days for Mr. Incredible have been relived and now he shares this experience with his loving family.This is a great film so watch it for yourself if you have not seen it already. It is bound to be the best computer animated film you will ever watch. Every scene was perfectly composed with no flaws whatsoever. And bring your family, they'll enjoy it too."	5.0	The Incredibles Overview (spoilers)	2005-12-14	2	1	1

The computer animation is amazing and the dialogue is very funny.  I laughed my a** off at the Edith Head character, it was genius to channel her for this movie, she was the beginning and the end for movie fashion in her time.  This movie represents one of the rare instances when adults will enjoy a kids movie at least as much if not more than the children it is intended for.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	What a fascinating break from Pixar's usual jig of toys and furry creatures and the pat themes of parenting. This is all grown-up stuff but told with wit tighter than the spandex on our lovable Parrs family.The setups are clearly a throwback to older cartoons I've seen reruns of: Marvel Comics, Johnny Quest, Thunderbirds, even a welcome dose of James Bond.But it goes far beyond in musing over the private and often troubled lives of heroes once they shed their skin-tight robes and resume their secret identities. They talk like us, bleed like us, love like us, and you could almost imagine these heroes as next-door neighbors going off to their daily chores, which often involved saving the world from Armageddon.The film's production values are topnotch. The CGI is slick yet life-like, and the imagination behind some of the superheroic ruses is uncanny.The humor is sharp even when it flirts with comic book conventions without insulting them. For instance, a hilarious joke comes from a fashion designer who costumes superheroes but rants against capes as accessories. There's a funny montage of superhero mishaps that illustrate her point.The background score recreates the sound of 1960s spy music so rousingly one could mistake it for a lost John Barry Bond soundtrack.Barring a minor slow patch three-quarters into the movie when we slack off to discover the normal lives of our heroes, this is a gut-busting, heartwarming tale, as perfect a family film as any in the last decade. Must-own DVD.	5.0	"AS SYNDROME POINTS OUT, ""YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT THIS IS COOL!"""	2005-03-12	51	40	11

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A38S8RD8XOXLVS	"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic"""	"Pixar's The Incredibles looked so good in the trailer I anxiously looked forward to going to the theatre to see it on the big screen. Due to financial reasons I missed the theatrical release. I anxiously awaited the DVD and bought it as soon as it came out. Having seen the movie on my 12.1""computer screen, The Incredibles is the best superhero movie ever made period. It deserved the Oscar it won for best animated feature.Iron Giant writer and Director Brad Bird made his definitive film with his second film the Incredibles. His original story about superheroes has a huge heart and soul that will put a smile on your face. In every frame you can feel his passion and enthusiasm towards telling the story of Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, a man who just wants to help people. The story starts in the golden age of ""Supers"" with Mr. I on his way to his wedding where his desire for helping people keeps him from getting to the church on time. Stopping crime after crime he thinks nothing of it preventing a man from committing suicide or dismissing deranged sidekick wanna-be Incredi-Boy twice. Both of those events will have a major impact on his future. The suicide jumper sues Mr. Incredible and wins. This leads to a mountain of lawsuits that force the Supers into hiding.Fifteen years later and 50 pounds heavier, Bob's stuck in a dead-end job at an insurance company. You feel for Bob being the big man confined to that tiny cubicle and his torment driving to work in one of the tiniest cars ever made. His spirit not broken by the mediocre world around him, He still tries to secretly help people at his job and secretly at night with the help of his old buddy Frozone. I love the scenes in the burning building and in the jewelry store!Bob's passion for helping people is his greatest strength and his Achilles heel. It leads to him being fired from his job and taking a new one for the mysterious Mirage. On these secret missions Bob suits back up as Mr. Incredible making tons of money and getting the glory of the old days. Things go well until Bob in his new ""family"" costume winds up missing. The psychotic Syndrome, the former Incredi-Boy all grown up, has kidnapped him and is holding him prisoner on his island. We learn Syndrome has killed numerous supers preparing in his quest to get revenge on Mr. Incredible. He plans on releasing his omnidroid on the city having it attacked and will come out to save it himself.Worried about Bob, Helen and the kids go looking for him starting with a visit to Edna mode. Mrs. I suited up in new costume goes looking for Bob. The kids stow away and that's when the movie really starts getting good. When missiles hit the jet Elasti-Girl is on the movie the thrilling action sequences on Syndrome's island builds into a bigger more intense one until the end of the movie.The art design captures the iconic qualities of the classic superhero costume and the era of the 1960's where the ""silver age"" of comics started. If you look closely, most of the designs use four-colors only the way classic superhero costumes do. Keeping things simple costume wise makes you focus on the characters' faces where most of the action truly is.The computer animation is the best I've seen in a movie. Facial expressions and movements not only look real, they feel real. These computer generated characters showed more emotion in their faces than the actors in most real movies today. The costumes look like real cloth. The water feels wet; the fire feels hot. The island environments look so real you want to step out on the beach! The entire staff of Pixar should give themselves a big round of applause. They've surpassed the gold standard for computer animation and storytelling they set over the years. They've now established the Platinum standard for animation and storytelling.The voice over acting here is actually better than the real acting in most feature films. Craig T. Nelson gives a great voice over performance as the confident Mr. Incredible. Holly Hunter is solid as the stretched out mom, Elasti-girl. Sarah Vowell captures Violet's shyness perfectly. Samuel L Jackson steals the few scenes he's in as Frozone; my hope is that Pixar will spin him off in his own movie. (Frozone is that cool!) Jason Lee is so nasty and so evil as Syndrome you want to see him die; Brad Bird steals the movie as Edna Mode, fashion designer to the Supers.The DVD extras are well worth the purchase price. The commentary and ""making of"" feature shows you how passionate everyone was during the creation of this film I love the cheesy Mr. Incredible cartoon on Disc 2. It's even funnier with the over-the top commentary from Mr. I and Frozone. Boundin' is a great stand alone film. The Violet essay is interesting. Seeing the alternate opening and the villain they wanted to use I'm glad they made changes because the opening they used works way better at telling the story of Bob Parr.I'm a long time comic book Sci-fi fan. After experiencing a year of numerous live-action superhero movie disappointments (Spider man 2, Catwoman, Punisher, Blade Trinity) Brad Bird and Pixar's animation team have shown me that the genre of the superhero movie isn't dead. It just needs someone passionate like Brad Bird with an ""incredible"" amount of heart to tell the story onscreen.A Shawn James Essential video. You've got to pick this one up along with a new DVD player or two. If you've got kids in the house you'll be playing this one so much you'll definitely go through a couple of machines!"	5.0	A BIG movie with a BIG heart	2005-03-24	3	2	1

This one directed by Brad Bird who also did the excellent ""Iron Giant"".  Bird knows how to bring Cartoon Action Adventure stories to life in such a way that it is enjoyable for adults but not too scary for the Pre Teens.""The Incredibles"" is an excellent story of a family gifted with Super Powers who much adjust to a world where their gifts must be hidden.  The father Mr. Incredible is saddled with a dull job in the insurance industry where his desires even to help folks with their mundane claims are stifled by tight fisted management.Given an opportunity by a mysterious Spectre/Thrush type agency to use his powers again he succumbs to his mid life doldrums and signs back up.  When he finds he's working for the forces of evil he's captured and must be rescued by his super powered family.The DVD is great and includes a funny short featuring Baby Jack Jack that explains some of the action occuring off screen in the film.  There is also a Pixar short called ""Bounce"" featuring a Sheep and a Jackalope that my kids really like.The 1950's style short featuring Mr. Incredible and pal Frozone doesn't come off quite as well.I would reccomend the DVD to everyone and would also suggest you check out Brad Bird's older movie, ""the Iron Giant""."	5.0	Pixar Does it again	2005-06-27	4	2	2

It's missing something that is hard to put my finger on.  I think the story was not well developed enough.  I know it's ""just a cartoon"", but it's still a feature length film and as this form of entertainment comes more into its own, more will be expected of it.

After a slew of lawsuits from people who didn't ask to be saved though, these brave men and women with amazing gifts are asked to leave behind their 'super hero life' and adjust to living a 'normal' life instead. For most of them, that's not problem. But for Bob Parr (IE: Mr. Incredible), it's not so easy.When Bob is approached to start working again using his super hero abilities, he's all for it. The problem comes when he doesn't realize who he is working for and what he wants.The characters in this movie come alive. I laughed out loud at Karli and Enda (NO CAPES!) and laughed at Dash tricking his teacher with a tack.There are a few scenes that I think would scare kids but other than that, this movie is entertaining, well done and fun to watch.	5.0	Simply an Incredible Movie	2012-11-20	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A28364B5MYR96B	"Sonny ""BCAT"""	There are so many different themes trapped in this one little kids movie, it's hard to single one out to write about.  The Incredibles are a family of Super Heroes retired by the government after a series of costly lawsuits from people who did not want to be saved.  Mr. Incredible is now working in insurance while his wife Helen (Elastigirl) stays home with the kids.  There are three children: Dash who can run faster than the speed of light, Violet who can make herself invisible and create forcefields, and Jack-Jack who has no apparent super powers (or so we think).Mr. Incredible, or Robert as he is now known, tries to help the customers which gets him in hot water with his boss.  He slumps at his desk knowing he was meant to be doing something more meaningful.  This is what makes this movie so great.  This problem is very human.  Which one of us hasn't sat at his desk and thought he was useless.  Maybe it takes superheroes to really elicit humanity.Robert and Lucius aka Frozone try to relive the glory days through a police scanner, and this leads to a job for Mr. Incredible, which he does succesfully, after which Robert becomes a much better husband and father (another very human characteristic, when we are happy with our work, we are happy with other parts of our lives as well).  All of this leads to a confrontation with a boy that Mr. Incredible shunned when he was still a superhero, and some really great visual action ensues, and all of the players get involved.This is not a kids movie, though kids will probably like it as well.  This movie was made for adults and comic book geeks as it contains many references to superheroes and comic book movies.  It is truly fun for the whole family.	5.0	Recapturing the Glory Days	2005-03-17	1	1	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AGMW3I34INNYG	Stephen Cannon	As a lifelong superhero fan, a movie such as this immediately peaks my interest.  Hearing that it was conceived by Brad Bird, the brains behind the hugely underrated 'The Iron Giant,' only made me more curious and (I must admit) geekishly excited.  My first experience with this movie floored me.  The look is like nothing else anyone has done, including parent company Pixar.  Animators and character designers all took huge risks here, with huge payoffs.  Behind all of the sleek animated razzle-dazzle is a well, conceived, sensitively written story that has family values at its heart.Our story opens in the 'glory days.'  Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible (voiced with surprising appropriateness by Craig T. Nelson) is en route to a, ahem,  special occasion when his police band radio picks up a report of a police pursuit.  Mr. I joins the chase, and a pleasing mix of action and hilarity ensues.  Unfortunately for our hero and his friends, said action/hilarity results in lawsuits against the 'supers,' which in turn leads to the national ban on super activities.  Flash forward ten years, and our hero, his wife Helen (Holly Hunter, another nice voice performance), and their three kids are trying to live normal lives.  Once again... yup, you guessed it.  Hilarity and action.The visual look of this movie is heavily stylized, reflecting what Bird calls 'a vision of the future looking ahead from the 60's.'  For some it might not work, but for me it has kept my eyes glued to the screen on repeated viewings.  Michael Giacchino's score puts a great retro spin on the whole story, adding hot jazz riffs to some wonderful orchestral colors.  The cast and animators manage to evoke some real emotion throughout. This is a slick superhero tale, but with heart and depth of feeling.  For my money, this is easily as good as, and in most cases better than, most so-called super hero films.  Here's hoping for a sequel that's just as incredi... ummm, super. Final Grade: A	5.0	The title rings true!	2005-03-22	4	3	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3LXKO2S6G2DBI	"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant"""	"I've said it before, and I'll say it again:  The best stuff on television and in film nowadays comes in animated form.  How is it that the writers, directors, and actors of live-action productions can't seem to generate much that isn't a half-hearted imitation of better productions from years ago while those in animation seem to keep getting better and better?  While it borrows heavily in atmosphere from James Bond and other 60s spy movies (as well as  ""The Return of the Jedi"" and other sci-fi action flicks), ""The Incredibles"" is a rollicking good time in its own right . . . and is a better James Bond movie than any produced in the past 20 years.  The idea of a family of superheroes isn't exactly new--and shows like ""The Tick"" have already lampooned the tribulations of superheroes in an everyday world--but ""The Incredibles"" pulsates with such energy and imagination that it's easy to overlook its faults.  Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are two actors I'd never have thought to pair up, but here they work amiably as a husband and wife team of semi-retired crimefighters struggling to raise a family while remaining incognito from a litigious world.  When a new archenemy arises (who looks like the love child of Heat Miser and John Lithgow), they are pressed back into action, this time with the help of their kids.  The computer animation in ""The Incredibles"" is solid, and the images and score manage to evoke Bonds like ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""The Man with the Golden Gun,"" as well as productions like ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""Johnny Quest,"" and even the Walt Disney spaceflight shows.  True, there is some surprising violence, and this is another vehicle aimed at children that seems to want to teach them that only white people and the occasional black sidekick (here Samuel L. Jackson instead of Eddie Murphy or Chris Tucker) exist in the world, but it's a fun ride.  I do hope those responsible produce a sequel, if one with a bit more diversity."	5.0	A Lot of Fun	2005-04-24	4	3	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1C1BJD5L7WI6K	Stephen McMenamin	Noting over four hundred reviews of The Incredibles already logged, I am adding mine only because I appear to be in the minority. While I admired the writing, the amazing animation, and most of the voice work, I was not as impressed with The Incredibles as were most of the other reviewers.I had two main problems with this film: First, it is simply too long. There should be far more deleted scenes on the DVD. It must be heartbreaking to cut scenes into which the film makers have poured so much love and effort, both of which are evident here. Nevertheless, had it been, say, 20 minutes shorter, it would have been a better film.Second, this film does not find an effective balance between being funny and being moving. The silliness is great, but when they get into territory that ought to move us -- and they do appear to be trying to move us, the feeling is one of detachment.The other reviewers have done a wonderful job of hailing the film's many strengths. I want only to round out the picture with these impressions.	3.0	Very good but hardly great	2005-11-11	19	12	7

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ARIO60NOWL6ZT	Steve Herr	"As a kid I loved to read comic books, mostly from Marvel and DC Comics.  I noticed a lot of reviewers accusing Pixar of plagiarism.  There are just so many types of super powers to go around.  Perhaps DC Comics (Superman) should sue Marvel for the Thing's and Hulk's strength.  DC also had an Invisible Girl who could turn invisible and create force fields (The two powers seem to go together, hmmm?)All in all, it was one great film.  Take it from someone who has been reading comics to one degree or another for almost 50 years, this movie brings back the awe and emotions that are the ""drug"" for comic readers.An aditional plus is the internal conflicts that make the Parrs seem like a real family, with all of their conflicts - only to discover, finally, that family is the most important adventure."	5.0	An Incredible Movie	2005-09-05	1	1	0

None of those subjects sounded particularly interesting to me, but I ended up loving every film. It's hard to select a favorite because every one has merit, but I would pick Ratatouille if forced to choose. That was written and directed by Brad Bird who also wrote and directed The Incredibles.I'm not a fan of superhero movies in general. They tend to focus on the special powers of the superhero and tell us very little else. The characters are usually little more than sketches. That said, each one is highly anticipated and almost guarantees success at the box office. It's the most popular genre. Christopher Nolan elevated the genre to a new level with Batman Begins and the hugely popular Dark Knight. They remain my favorite superhero movies by far, but why do I believe that?Nolan gives his characters depth and we understand why they do what they do. He also makes it seem possible that they can do what they do. Quite simply, I believe that such characters could exist.The Incredibles uses a similar technique and puts the characters in today's world. What happens to superheroes that grow old and fat? What do they do when they aren't foiling crimes? What if they try to help someone who doesn't want to be helped? Do superheroes marry and start a family? If they did, would their children also have special powers?All of these things are addressed and more.We learn some of the character's motivations at the beginning of the movie when they are interviewed on TV. Each superhero is introduced. We meet Mr. Incredible (strength), Elastigirl (flexibility) and Frozone (freezes things). There's also a boy who calls himself Incrediboy and wants to be Mr. Incredibles' sidekick, but he's rejected and not allowed to become part of the team.After a series of incidents end in people suing the superheroes, the government forces them to retire, relocate and live as normal people. Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl marry and have three children. Violet can become invisible and make force shields, while her brother, Dash, runs at an incredible speed. Baby Jack-Jack is still developing his powers.They are known as the Parr family and try to remain inconspicuous. Mr. Incredible and Frozone pine for the old days and secretly fight crime by lying to their wives and claiming to go bowling. They are being monitored and Mr. Incredible is given a solo mission by an unknown agency. He succeeds, but almost dies in the process. We learn that Incrediboy has never recovered from the rejection 15 years earlier and that he's been scheming to get his revenge under his new name, Syndrome.The movie is full of invention. Although many of the characters seem to have been inspired by the Fantastic Four, they use their powers in unpredictable ways. The family members are particularly good at combining their skills and there's a lot of humor in the film. Some of it is quite subtle and best appreciated by adults, but there's plenty for the kids too. It's an action-packed story filled with explosions and battles. Syndrome's hideout looks like something out of a James Bond movie, as do many of the gadgets.The conclusion is satisfying and paves the way for a sequel should Pixar ever decide to make one. This is a movie that has the potential to appeal to viewers of any age and it's a lot of fun. If I learned one thing it's that wearing a cape can be a dangerous business.Video Quality 5/5Disney consistently produces wonderful transfers. Some of the classic titles were made 70 years ago and look better than ever. Pixar hasn't been around that long and the animation looks modern and three-dimensional. Every Pixar movie to date has been just about perfect and The Incredibles is no different.Sound Quality 5/5The Incredibles is a good choice to show off your home theater system. As well as a stunning transfer, the sound quality will satisfy any movie enthusiast. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 ES mix is capable of shaking the room at times, but doesn't disappoint with the finer details.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1RD2TSQ2IE5LW	Steven Sabin	"With movies like Shrek and Shark's Tale, Hollywood's goal with animated movies lately seems to be how far filmmakers can push the envelope in terms of weaving adult humor and sexuality into ""family"" films.  As a result, I was becoming rather cynical.  Yeah, the production values and music and acting in many of these movies is outstanding, but why did the goal have to be ""how much can we get away with while maintaining a PG rating?""I'm pleased to report that (as another reviewer likewise mentioned) this film restored my faith in family animated films.Everything about this film was well done.  The plot, the music, the art direction, the animation, the casting of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson, and of course the acting.The PLOT:The Incredibles is about a family of superheroes.  Public pressure and a lawsuit have caused the government to suspend all superhero activities because the liabilities are too high.  As such, the few remaining superheroes have been put into a sort of FBI ""witness protection program"" where they have to assume normal identities.  Trouble is, Mr. Incredible (played by Craig T. Nelson) is incredibly bored with his menial job as an insurance agent and his kids are having trouble keeping their super-abilities concealed.  Nobody in the family seems truly happy and Mr. Incredible trudges off to work each day in a funk.  His perky wife (played by Holly Hunter) tries to keep everything together, but the strain is obviously wearing on everyone.  When Mr. Incredible is approached with a secret assignment to use his superpowers again, he jumps at the chance.  However, he soon finds out that he's been tricked and is being held hostage by an evil genius and wannabe superhero named Syndrome.  When Mrs. Incredible learns of the plot, it's up to her and the kids to use their own superpowers to rescue Mr. Incredible and together save the world from Syndrome and his latest creation.The GOOD:1) The plot is genuinely fun and wholesome as a fragmented family learns to love and appreciate one another again while working as a team.2) The artwork is absolutely fabulous - it has a 60s James Bond feel to it that I loved.  As a child of the 60s, I love this retro look.3) Music was likewise fabulous and had that 60s James Bond / Peter Gunn feel to it.  It perfectly complemented the visual aspect of the movie.  I have a decent home theater system and the movie sounds superb - both music and sound effects.4) The language was wholesome throughout - no sexual innuendoes or double entendres as seem to be so ""fashionable"" in other animated films these days.  There was plenty of visual and verbal humor here - outstanding writing.5) The animation iself was absolutely superb.  CG just keeps getting better and better, but they don't use it to carry the film here.  The music, acting, script, and production values all contribute to a first-class movie6) Parents and kids alike will enjoy this because the plot deals with adult issues, like marriage problems, without being unsuitable for even small children and the language and nuances, as noted in #4 above, never crosses the line into PG-13 territory.7) The casting was superb.  The voices matched the characters perfectly.  I particularly liked the disaffected teen voice of Violet and the guy who did Syndrome.  Both are unknowns but were perfect for the parts.  Nelson, Hunter, and Jackson are perfect as well.  And as I note below (see TRIVIA), the person who voiced ""E"" was not only a surprise, they were absolutely perfect for the part as well.The BAD:Can you spell ""none?""The UGLY:Again, none.The TRIVIA:You'll notice how Mr. Incredible, Dash, Jack-Jack, and Syndrome all look similar to one another.  That's because they are all visually patterned after the director, Brad Bird.  Bird is also the voice of ""E"" - the fashion designer in the movie, clearly patterned after Edith Head.  He perfectly nails the snobbish, cultured elite fashionista thing.  When I realized it was a male doing her voice when the credits rolled at the end, I was amazed.  When I realized it was the director's voice, I was even more amazed.  Bird is apparently a bit of a control freak, but whatever he did, it resulted in a fabulous film and put Pixar back on the map again as a force to be reckoned with.The BOTTOM LINE:Pixar has shown that they are the masters of this genre with such home runs as Toy Story and Toy Story 2.  In my opinion, The Incredibles is even better and is their best effort to date.  The extra features on the DVD are enjoyable as well, and I never tire of watching how the animators do their thing.  There is also a hysterical little short called ""Jack-Jack Attack"" that shows what happens with the Incredible's infant son Jack-Jack when they leave him with a babysitter and he displays his budding superpowers.I can't imagine anyone honestly not enjoying this film.  It has to be one of the best family films ever produced - animated or otherwise.  I'm glad we own it.  I enjoy watching it every 6 months or so.  If you've never seen the movie, watch it.  If you are like 99.999% of the population, you'll love it too."	5.0	SUPERB!	2007-02-28	4	3	1
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AZZZ159U3Q5OO	Strat Cat	I came to this film with many doubts - mainly that it'd be a kids' movie and way to childish for me. Wow, was I wrong! If anything, I'd say this movie would appeal more to adults than kids.I loved Marvel comics as a youngster and this movie was full of the kind of wonderful superhero imagery I'd loved so much, but presented in such a sophisticated way that at no point did it feel 'beneath' me. But that's not the end of the story by a long way.The plot isn't particularly sophisticated, don't get me wrong, but it's the way in which the whole movie has been crafted that creates the wonder, the spectacle. The animation was superb - but that's only to be expected these days. The character voices were good, but, again, nothing special these days. So what made it so good? It was so 'real'. The characters 'acted', they weren't just cartoon people going through the motions; the basic premise, which I won't elaborate on and spoil for you, was intriguing; the ideas - super hero stunts, etc - were inventive, never predictable; the dialogue was fresh, often very witty, and really dragged you into the characters and their world. This is a movie that has obviously been crafted with immense love, dedication, and patience, culminating in a creation that truly deserves all the accolades it has received since its release.This is the best movie I've seen this year, possibly even for a couple of years. I look forward to many more viewings and to thoroughly savouring all the extras on the dvd.	5.0	Lives up to its title - Incredible.	2006-12-28	0	0	0

It's the favourite when kids come to visit us. You can just keep the kids busy watching this movie while the adults can peacefully have their time to socialize. Sometimes we just want to see a scene from the movie, particularly the chase scenes and we end up watching the movie till the end instead.The animation is a work of art and is going to be enjoyed for a long time in the history of animated films. Unlike other animation films that gradually fade away from memory ""The Incredibles"" is one that is still worthy of being watched even after so many others have been released after its release. After watching this movie it is difficult to imagine it was an animated one. It has plenty of fantastic action. The most amazing concept is this movie is in its similarity to real life situations (hero-villian-story) rather than rely heavily on the ""almost zero probability concept"" i.e scenes where things shown or depicted have a chance in a million to take place. It is one thing that makes animation movies seem really silly for adults as animation movies are so full of them.Best Animated film of the year Oscar was a deserving award for the movie.

The delightful and refreshing The Incredibles blends both together for me - heroes and movies.I'll be honest - in the past (with the exception of the first 2 Toy Story movies), when a trailer for a Pixar film was released, I was less than enthused.  I have, however, seen every Pixar film and loved them all.  The trailers never looked appealing to me until the Incredibles.  Shrek, Shark Tale, Ice Age - they've got zip on Pixar!Getting back to my review of this film, all I can say is The Incredibles is a winner on all levels.  Animation is top notch (increasingly better with each film), voice acting (and the casting selection) is superb, cinematography (even though it's digital) is exceptional, and the score (especially with The Incredibles) is a perfect fit.The premise is a fitting portrait of today's world.  All the super heroes go into hiding and melt away into 'normal life' because of lawsuits pop up from individuals who didn't want to be saved, therefore causing a public superhero backlash.  Naturally, it doesn't take long for heroes to re-emerge and once again save the day from terrible peril while being hoisted back into the public spotlight...that's enough premise/plot...just sit back and delight in the masterfully crafted film by Brad Bird (The Iron Giant) known as The Incredibles.Whether you're an adult, child, or man-child, this movie will take you in and make you forget you're watching a movie.  The visuals and story is captivating and well written.  After just having suffered through about 1/3 of the 77th Annual Oscars (many thanks to the creators of TiVo), the highlight of the night for me was The Incredibles winning Best Animated Feature of 2004 (and Clint Eastwood winning Best Director and Best Picture for Million Dollar Baby).  I was so worried that the vacuous Hollywood types were going to give the BAF Oscar to the vapid Shrek 2.  Thank God the voting members have some sense!If you like quality films, purchase this DVD now and don't look back.  Enjoy!	5.0	Incredible!

Sure, they get best animated film every once in a while, but each new release by this outfit is truly a timeless gem. Disney did well to buy them out because Pixar is where it's at.The Incredibles is the quintessential Pixar film: tight, entertaining plot, beautiful animation, great characters, and a moral of the story that many pictures don't have these days (especially films by Pixar's main competition Dreamworks Animation). When I heard there was a director for this picture, I thought it was odd, but when you see it come together as a work of art and you compare it to other, less-polished films, you know why.Not only should this have won best picture of the year, it should be recognized as one of the best pictures of all time.	5.0	One of the best movies of our time	2011-04-28	0	0	0

Marginal cleverness in a first world country should not be applauded. This was marketed to kids and adults alike but the premise set up in the first few minutes was so weak as to put off anyone who has every been stuck in a waiting room and had to read just one copy of the American Bar Journal. We all know that a spate of joe-blows suing superheros whom the governement depends upon is ridiculous. That would get legislated so fast it would make Jack McCoy's head spin.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2FSUEOUNU88KG	The Deadly Nightshade	"Having finally gotten around to watching ""The Incredibles"", I am completely blown away.  Not by the fancy computer graphics, though those are certainly a treat for the eye.  Rather, I am amazed by just how versatile this movie really is, thematically speaking.But let's spend a bit of obligatory time talking about the technical marvel.  These days, technically marvelous movies are a dime a dozen.  That said, the computer graphics are wonderful given their level of detail.  Simply making the characters' hair look as realistic as it does is an amazing accomplishment, considering how difficult that is with a computer.  To say nothing of keeping the hair looking realistic during those few scenes where it gets wet.This is the tip of the iceberg of all the minor details.  You don't notice them while watching the movie just because they're so realistic.  If the details were different, or missing completely, the experience would be jarring and break the suspension of disbelief that makes the movie work.  Instead, we have the realistic hair, muscles under skin that move properly, sunlight filtering through trees in the jungle, and so much more.  The attention to detail really is amazing.None of it is photorealistic, however, and that actually works to this movie's advantage.  It has a retro-futuristic-sixties look that, when combined with the heavy brass music, brings to mind a lot of the old Sean Connery ""James Bond"" flicks.  And in line with the Bond movies, ""The Incredibles"" is a first-rate action movie.  Sort of like ""Marvel Superheroes"" meets ""Mission Impossible"", there's a lot of fast, well choreographed action scenes between our family of superheroes and their powerful, well-equipped enemies.  The action alone, and the lessons the heroes learn about themselves and their powers, is more than enough to make this an enjoyable movie.But on top of everything else, ""The Incredibles"" is also mixed with a generous helping of Woody Allen-style mid-life angst, and here is where the thematic part comes in.  Underneath the highly entertaining, bellicose action are very deep issues regarding what it means to be special, the differences between what we expect of our future and what really happens, the pain of being dissatisfied with life, and the lengths our society goes to in order to keep everything bland and the same.  As Mr. Incredible himself says, our society ""keeps creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity.""If you take away the fun and the action, there is still a lot to think about, giving ""The Incredibles"" a whole new dimension to enjoy.  This is a great movie for people who like to think and ask questions.  In the manner of all the best thought-provoking movies and shows, the movie itself doesn't answer any of these questions, making it a sort of inkblot test.  Is this a parable for how society likes to beat down people who are truly special?  Or is the message that all people should strive to be their best no matter what anyone else might say?  The message, and how you feel about it, are left to the viewer.But whether you focus on the action or the themes, keep in mind that this movie is rated PG for a reason.  There is quite a bit of violence, and many of the bad guys bite the dust in their fights with the superheroes.  There is no blood and gore, mind you, but lots of gun shots and explosions.  The movie's fights are very clearly for keeps, and it might not be appropriate for preteens.  Don't think that just because this is a Disney Pixar movie, it must be rated G.As long as the viewer can stand that level of violence, this is an excellent movie on many different levels.  Between the themes, the issues the characters all deal with, and the action, there is a great deal of depth.  The ending of the movie is really satisfying on all those levels, resolving everything for the characters without resolving everything for the viewer.  This is a movie for action fans and thinkers alike.On top of all this, there are nice extras on the second DVD of the set.  There are two 5 minute animated shorts: Boundin', which was shown in the theater immediately before The Incredibles; and Jack-Jack Attack, which shows a bit of action that happens off camera in the movie.  Also, there are a lot of behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of the movie, secret files on all the superheroes, and much more.  It is very entertaining.Summary:Pros:- Great action- Great atmosphere- Great plot- Great themes and issues- Great extras on disc 2Cons:- Rated PG for violence"	5.0	A Modern Animated Feature That Makes You Think For A Change	2006-06-20	2	2	0

However, i would like to share with you a couple of reasons why i did no find this movie to be as good as it could have been.The storyline is very simple. Their dad gets taken and its up to the mom and two kids to go out and save him.The animation was good, however the characters looked extremely dull and did not posess any neat qualities that most of the animated characters do now a days. The action however, was very well done, but why not just see a real action movie instead of an animated one? I know your probobly ignoring what i am saying right now, but think about it. Theres nothing special about The Incredibles that there isn't in any other action movie, besides the fact that The Incredibles is computer animated.The music in the movie was very average as there weren't any parts of the movie where the music really startled me and made me want to listen in more.I have to admit, The Incredibles were funny at times, like when the fat dad is trying to get out of his car which is apparentely smaller then him, however that doesn't make up for the incredibly dull characters and weak storyline.	2.0	Great animation, however failed to entertain me.	2005-04-06	23	7	16

No, its not ""Shrek 2"".""The Incredibles"" is a great family film that shouldn't be missed.This is also, & surprisingly, one of those films that you should see on the big screen & not on home video.Everyone knows what a superhero is. But, after saving a creep from his suicide attempt, Mr. Incredible & his fellow league of superheros are band by the Government from donning there supersuits & saving innocent citizens, forcing them to live, eternally, as there secret identities. This is only, of course, after the suicide creep wins a victorious lawsuit against Incredible for injuries in the rescue, as well as, invading the creep's privacy.Mr. Incredible still saves the day, only now as an insurance claims adjustor, saving the city's people, one claim at a time. His wife, Helen, aka, Elasti-Girl, plays housewife to her & Incredible's three kids, Dash, a youngster who lives up to his name, Violet, the troubled teen who can dissapear at will, & Jack-Jack, the youngest family member with powers that are, well, mixed to say the least.Basically, its the not-so Fantastic Five & a ho-hum life, with Mr.Incredible yearning for the hero fighting days of old, Helen reminding him to live in & get used to the now, & breaking up the regular fighting between Violet & Dash, if they could just catch either one of them.Things start to pick up when a secret transmission message is found in Incredible's work briefcase telling him that there is a secret mission for him if he wants it & the reward is triple his usual yearly income, if he decides to take it.What Mr. Incredible doesn't know is that sinister forces are at work and its all a trap, led by a youngster who is Incredible's #1 fan.I was constantly reminded throughout most of this year that this movie was coming to theatres on Nov. 5, 2004, thanks to the trailer that you can not avoid on the ""Finding Nemo"" DVD. But, it was well worth the pay off (the film will probably be the big movie for the Xmas season right along with ""The Polar Express"").""The Incredibles"" is basically, bits of the Marvel Comic ""The Fantastic Four"" with a dash of Disney, with PIXAR animation & humor. All of the characters are great and well thought-out.The animation is top notch with new advances that leap off the screen (especially, during the action sequences).I wouldn't be surprised if ""The Incredibles"" walked off with the best animated film Oscar of '04.Its that good."	5.0	"Super, Wicked, Bad-Ass, Awesome, ""Incredibles"""	2004-11-09	1	0	1

This movie, is action packed with each action sequence out-shining the last, also filled with some humor, and creativity!!!This is a product made by the Academy Award winning creators of ""Finding Nemo"",- in this action packed adventure, that is a combination of the ""Fantastic Four"", ""James Bond"", ""Indiana Jones"", all combined into this masterpiece!!! It is actually hard to believe Disney and Pixar were able to make something this good!!!The basic story starts off with Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) and his wife Helen (Elastic Girl), both retired super heroes, forced to blend in with soicety, and they must try to fit in!!! Their children:  Dash with super speed, and Violet with powers and invisiblity and creting force fields,.... and Jak Jak,a baby full of many suprises!!! When Bob Parr, starts conducting secret hero work, for a top secret govenment facilty on an island, and gets into some trouble with Syndro, with an evil sceme!!! Together as a family they must work together and save the world and their family, along with a little help from Frozone!!!This has to be one of the best Disney movies yet, that is different from all the other Dsney films I've seen!!! The special effect are awesome too, behind the scenes action, documentaries, Secret files on the supers deleted scenes, and more,.... including Jak Jak Attack, a short film about how Jak Jak, had a fun time with the baby sitter, very funny!!!This is cinametic gold along with hours of great material, and eye candy for the whole family!!! This film will become an instant classic, and a gem in your collection. Yet, I myself like ""The Fantastic Four"" better, nevertheless still a great film!!! ""Two Thumbs Up""!!!

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1V51M8M216Y69	"T. Hooper ""thdizzy"""	This movie was much more than I expected.  The action is much better than what gets put out in action movies these days.  Also, Pixar does it again by providing us with some of the best characterization in Hollywood today.  They understand what really drives a story forward, and they keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.Basically the story is that the Supers of the golden age of superheros must retire due to the threat of mounting lawsuits.  However a threat brings back Mr. Incredible, but is he too out of shape to reclaim his former life as a superhero?  Watch it and see.  Kids and adults can both enjoy it.  In fact, you don't even need to have kids to go see this.  There are a lot of jokes for adults as well.  This is so good, I'll probably see it a few times in the theater.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"Bob and Helen Parr (Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter) have recently moved into their new suburban home with their three children, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox) and baby Jack Jack. Bob spends his day behind a desk at an insurance company and Helen stays at home. Attempting to blend in in the suburbs is difficult for them, but especially difficult for Bob. He used to be Mr. Incredible, before a series of lawsuits forced all of the Supers into retirement. Helen has acclimated more easily, but finds it difficult to keep a lid on their children's burgeoning super powers. Jack and his friend, Lucius (Samuel L. Jackson) go out for a boy's night, which for Bob includes listening to police scanners and trying to find clandestine ways to use his superpowers. After rescuing folks from a burning building, Bob returns home. But the fire has been ignited again. He soon receives a mysterious offer and jumps at the chance to use his powers again. Learning that many of the other Supers in retirement have disappeared, Mr. Incredible comes face to face with Syndrome (Jason Lee), the new villain in town.""The Incredibles"" is easily one of the most appropriately named films to be made in a long time. It is simply that. The newest film from Pixar combines human characters with the same attention to detail that has made all of their previous films so memorable.Written and directed by Brad Bird, the director of ""The Iron Giant"", a thoroughly underrated traditionally animated film released some years ago by Warner Bros., has found the perfect home for his talents, ""The Incredibles"" represents the perfect marriage of director and studio. Bird has been working on this project for a number of years, even before he started working with Pixar. At Pixar, they were able to help him realize his vision through computer animation. My friend Shannon described the film to someone as a ""great action film that's animated"". I couldn't have said it better myself.Shortly after the theatrical release, there was an article about the film and Bird in `Los Angeles' Magazine. It described how obsessed Bird became with every detail. This was his baby and he wasn't going to take any shortcuts. It clearly shows in every frame of the film.The film deftly blends comedy, edge of your seat suspense, great visuals, bright, colorful animation and great voice acting.The scenes of the Parr family living in suburbia are truly funny. To watch Bob, a huge hulking guy with a broad torso (think Superman, crammed into a small mini car, drive into his driveway and sullenly walk inside his home perfectly captures how many people feel about their lives. Violet and Dash are portrayed in a very realistic way. Violet is the older child, in Junior High, shy and afraid to talk to the boy she likes. Dash is the younger, more outgoing, precocious kid. They behave like a normal brother and sister would. They fight all the time. But if they have to help each other, they do and this shows that they really care about one another. Helen is gamely making a go of it in suburbia, because she is afraid of the consequences if her family's true identity is revealed.If you took all of the scenes of the family in suburbia and made a film simply of those, the result would be a great stand alone addition to any comedy library.After the family gets drawn into the action plot, things really kick into gear. Deftly combining elements of filmed superhero movies, James Bond adventures and action films, ""The Incredibles"" creates an amazing backdrop to tell an involving, exciting story.Many of the action sequences are set in buildings and landscapes clearly inspired by the James Bond films of the 60s. As Jack and Helen make their way through Syndrome's headquarters, a structure inspired by ""Dr. No"" or ""You Only Live Twice"", the filmmakers also play music inspired by 007 films. This provides a nice, unique and fun visual reference for the adults, to keep their attention.The action scenes are visually stunning, especially a scene referred to as the ""100 Yard Dash"". In it, Dash runs back and forth throughout the forest, trying to stay ahead of Syndrome's army of goons who are chasing him in small flying saucers. The camera moves at dizzying speeds, back and forth, up and down. It would have been extremely difficult to do this with live action.The film also takes an irreverent tone towards super hero films; much like ""Scream"" made fun of horror films. A scene in which Jack and Helen visit Edna, the costume designer to the Supers, evokes similar scenes between James Bond and Q. Edna is a hilarious character, inspired by famed costume designer Edith Head, and voiced by director Brad Bird. All of the clich&eacute;s of superhero films make appearances. For instance, Mr. Incredible tosses out a one-liner when he dispatches a villain, creating a pun about his name, much like James Bond does. Jack and Lucius talk about `monologueing', a trait they came across many times as Supers. After capturing them, the villain would begin a monologue about his greatness, in the process giving them time to escape.All of the voice actors are spot on. Craig T. Nelson (TV's ""Coach"") does a great job of capturing the boredom of everyman working a humdrum life and the unabashed excitement at doing something he is truly excited about. Holly Hunter is great as Helen and Elastigirl. Her lilting Southern drawl provides her character with an innocence that masks her toughness. The two child actors capture the moods and attitudes of children growing up. Violet has a voice that is low and bored, but will probably change any minute. Dash is always excited or extremely bored. Jason Lee is also great as the crazed Buddy and Syndrome, the villain, perfectly capturing the glee of the more over the top villains from other films. Samuel L. Jackson's role as Lucius and Frozone is also very effective. He is a bit more like Helen, than Jack, trying to acclimate to civilian life, but when the opportunity presents itself, he immediately throws himself into the role of Super.The animation in any Pixar film is top notch, and ""The Incredibles"" is no exception. What you might not notice is that with each new film, the animation becomes even more advanced and realistic. As mentioned before, this is the first Pixar film with an all `human' cast'. The attention to detail on each of the characters is amazing. Especially the hair. In previous digital animation, the hair has provided problems. For instance, in the first ""Toy Story"", there is a little puppy. He looks good, but he looks animated. In the second, this puppy looks 100 times better, because the software for animating the hair was that much more evolved. In ""The Incredibles"", each of the humans appears to have real hair, especially Syndrome, whose shock of hair resembles a large flame. There are many details which still appear `cartoonish', but these are intentional, for the sake of laughter; for instance, Bob's small car. I have no doubt that Pixar could animate a film that looked almost photorealistic.Bird is clearly in tune with superheroes. His previous film ""The Iron Giant"" is a very effective, sweet-natured homage to the sci-fi films of the 50s. Using traditional animation, he evokes a story of a lonely boy who stumbles across an Iron Giant. They become friends, but there are problems when the townsfolk realize that a giant robot from outer space is living in the vicinity.The DVD for ""The Incredibles"" is simply beautiful. The widescreen version of the film is clear, bright and colorful. Of course, since the film was created in computers, the transfer is naturally going to be more brilliant than a traditional film transfer.The second disc in the set contains a Making of Documentary, complete files on all of the Supers, an `early' animated effort featuring Mr. Incredible and Frozone, deleted scenes, and a `new' cartoon called ""Jack Jack Attack"".In the film, there is a moment in which Helen calls home to check on the babysitter watching Jack Jack, the baby. The babysitter has left a series of frantic messages. It is a funny scene. ""Jack Jack Attack"" is a short cartoon depicting the events leading up to the phone messages, before the family returns home. I am pretty sure that this cartoon was created from footage cut out of the original film. Perhaps they felt it was running too long. It is fun to watch the footage, but when a character, from the film, makes an appearance at the end of the short, it sort of gives away the real origin of this footage. As a stand alone cartoon, there is no reason for this character to appear. As I said, its fun to watch, but it really should have been included in the Deleted Scenes area, and not billed as a new creation. It's a great idea to create new shorts featuring these characters, as Disney did with Roger Rabbit.The Deleted Scenes are interesting and include an alternate opening that is more than a little odd. Thankfully, they didn't use it or any of the other deleted scenes. These scenes are presented as animatics, a sort of rough draft of the film, that animators use to make sure everything is working well, before doing all of the final (most time consuming and expensive phase) animation.The `early' animated short, with commentary by Mr. Incredible and Frozone, is interesting, but odd. I really think this was created recently, as part of the filmmaking process. Not as some sort of early project by Brad Bird. I could be wrong.The complete files of the Supers (which Mr. Incredible quickly scrolls through in a scene in the film) are interesting to read through. There are also audio files from each of the Supers, in their voices, talking about their lives.""The Incredibles"" is yet another top-notch addition to the Pixar library and yet another top-notch DVD that belongs in every collection."	5.0	Simply Put: Incredible	2005-03-23	9	7	2

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2NAI5C9U1HVAI	"Todd Hagley ""groucho75"""	"When Toy Story was released, I lived overseas and missed much of the initial hoopla over the new class of animated films that Disney was releasing. It was only after I was dragged to see Toy Story 2 did I see the light and agreed that Pixar was the true innovators of animated film. With each new release, I went in with doubts that it could never top the previous film, only to leave with such adoration for their latest work of genius.This adoration is a double-edge, however, as I never believe the next film fits the mold. When I heard of the concept for The Incredibles, I was dubious that it would capture my imagination the same way Monsters Inc, or Finding Nemo would. Of course, my fears were unfounded as this film is genius and is perhaps my favorite of the entire Pixar catalog.What makes Pixar films so different? How do they manage to do it? Why would I leap over wheelchair-bound nuns in order to buy a ticket for The Incredibles when you wouldn't catch me dead watching Shark Tale or Shrek 2?Pixar films excel because they're storytellers first, animators second.The stories in Pixar films are contained, but limitless in their appeal. Shrek has to rely on pop culture references within a fairy tale, which is either pandering or just lame. In film and television, there's the concept of the ""fourth wall"" which is the viewer. Pixar never destroys the fourth wall by breaking character or tone, while other animated films feel too self-congratulatory or self-aware for their own good.Pixar doesn't cast their voices based on celebrity star power, but rather on talent that conveys the range of emotions their stories require. DreamWorks' films feel like they're cast solely on how many millions the combined cast has brought into their coffers. Do you ever notice that except for the Toy Story films, they don't list the cast on posters or opening credits? The actors are important, but not more than the story. Shark Tale hits you over the head with so many ""stars"" that it has to show them in ads to convince people to see the film. There is a difference between acting and just reading lines.The story draws you in, makes you engage with the film and truly brings magic back to cinema screens. The detail is crucial, but not at the cost of the narrative.Oh, and the part about animation being second? That doesn't mean that this film ignores that aspect of the movie. This film is fluid, but tight; relaxed, but not sloppy. You forget after a while that this is animation, which is as high a compliment as animated films deserve.The Incredibles is a film that is lush with colors, swells with emotion, and scored with the right touch of relaxed swing to convey the era when superheroes captured the dreams of a generation. As a film, it puts regular features to shame with all of the elements of classic movie-making. Truly worthy of the Oscar presented to Brad Bird two nights ago, this film perfectly encapsulates why Pixar is the leader in the animated film industry.Bravo."	5.0	Why Pixar gets it right every single time...	2005-03-01	20	17	3
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A26LIR24MAM6VQ	"todd rich ""scoop 69"""	"There's not much that Pixar puts out , that doesn't come back , in gold bullions. In other words , all of their past films have been money making franchises. From Toy Story to Finding Nemo. In this case , their latest production, "" The Incredibles "" , is no different. The film is fantasic and incredibly delightful to watch. I actually took my kid to see it , opening weekend. I couldn't decide wheter to see that or the Will Smith , one. Luckily , we chose wisely. My son was amazed and harldy moved from his seat , as the film rolled. That in itself, speaks volumes , because he's only 22 months old. I think that one of the most amazing and impressive things about this film is that it's desined not only for kids , but for everyone. It's got that Bugs Bunny  , touch. The touch that moves the kids and imagination in all of us. It not only has phenominal cgi , but ""The Incredibles"" , has one of the best written scripts, of most of films, released this year. I was highly impressed with the charactor breakdowns and the energetic pace, that I plan on seeing it again. ""The Incredibles"" , earns it's title and places the level of cgi entertainment, even higher , for future filmmakers. Not only in the cgi , genre.....but in making entertaining and unforgettable films , altogether. Definately a film , that you'll want to catch , while it's still in theaters !! Then , after all the dust has setteled and it gets on dvd....you can place it beside it's predecesors and have Pixar night. Bottom line: "" The Incredibles"" is the best you're gonna get ......for a looooooooong time !!!"	5.0	Waiting for something special ???	2004-11-11	0	0	0

I just finished watching this film for the umpteenth time with my 8-year-old, and I have to say, each time I view the film, I see something else which amazes me, either in the animation or--most often--in the story.  There's so much more to this film than kiddie-thrills.  It is, as other reviewers have pointed out, a brilliant metaphor for the Family as the truest Superheroes of all: Mom, who ""stretches herself"" endlessly in support of others; Dad, who demonstrates ""super-human strength"" when necessary; Teenage Daughter, who struggles against feeling ""invisible"" in her world to finally appreciate her genuine power; and Son, who's in such a rush to claim his greatness that he's in danger of ""speeding"" right past it.  This film has something to say about the triumph of mediocrity over true greatness--an epidemic in our world, I fear.  It's a film of brilliant creativity, edgy humor and abundant heart.  I can't think of any movie in the last decade which has said so much, or which has said it with more grace and style.

The animation was exciting, realistic, and yet bright and exciting (pleasing both children and adults).  The humor was intelligent, and multi-layered enough to please a wide age range.  The plot was ""incredible"" and fantasy-like, yet realistic enough that if super powered people existed, we could imagine it playing out this way.The whole Syndrome character was a huge plus!  His identity was the perfect surprise.  Some may have guessed, but most, like me thought, ""Oh wow...of course, why didn't I think of it?""  Hindsight is beautiful for surprises in cinema!Bottom-line:  Four stars for a solid story, well-acted and intelligently presented.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AMSY709HJWQUY	"Tracey Fountain ""yeahmyfoot.com"""	"I have loved this movie since when I first saw it in theaters. On the surface the movie is a fun adventure story with a conflict between good and evil (good wins). However it is also about family, finding your strength, and being different.An unconventional approach to your traditional superhero movies, this one visits the private lives of heroes and addresses the duality of having so much power, yet not always fitting in to public life easily. It speaks to the tendency of society to praise everyone equally. We emphasize minor accomplishments and understate great accomplishments in order that no one feels bad- ""When everyone is special, no one is."" I fully agree. I think this is something we need to hear today and I'm glad Pixar had the guts to say it.The film also highlights the value of having your family there for you and explores relationships in the 'Incredible' family: husband to wife, parents to kids, brother to sister. The movie defines each character well (except JackJack who is after all a baby) and you believe they are real. It strikes a nice balance of dramatic and humorous, the story is well paced and the plot delightfully unexpected.I highly recommend this movie which has lost nothing in the conversion from big screen to DVD. It is a fabulous addition to any home DVD collection and one you will love watching for years to come."	5.0	Great movie in theaters, great at home!	2008-08-08	0	0	0

Released in '04 The Incredibles hit the ground running becoming one of Pixar's biggest hits even spawning a video game sequel(The Incredibles Rise of the Underminer). This release looks pretty damn good in it's 1080p presentation, hands down one of the best transfers for 3D animation. Plants look lush, water is crystal clear and you can see strands of hair( one real goos shot was when Elasti-Girl looks at Mr. Incredible's suit and notices it's been stitched up, the detail on the fabric is crystal clear and sharp ).The audio track is amazing( English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio ) in that you can feel every bit of sound you hear. There's also a dolby digital track for the french and spanish audio as well as a English 2.0 dvs, I briefly heard the french track out of curiosity and so far it's on par with the english one. Subtitles look great in that you can see them and they don't blur the screen or blind into the background making it difficult to see them.This release is jam packed with extras spread out over each disc giving you more then enough to keep you coming back to watch them over time=Disc #1 & 2-Three commentary tracks( Directors, Animators and one for the short film )-Jack Jack Attack( short film on what Jack was doing while being babysat )-Jack Jack Attack Explored( Bird & company discuss what went into making Jack Jack Attack )-The Incredibles Reunited( Bird, Walker, Sage, Newton, Fucile, Romano and Andrews come together to talk about the movie from planning to finished film )-Elle's Anthem( Compser Rolfe Kent talks about recording the score for the film )Disc #3 & 4-Paths To Pixar( feature about the storyboard crew )-Studio Stories( How a party for the group ends with a birthday cake showing up )-Ending With A Bang( 2D expression for the film and going for a retro 60's look for the end credits )-The New Nomanison( Interactove map of Nomanison Island with a introduction )-Deleted Scenes( Seven scenes in HD )-Incredibles Teaser trailer-Making Of-Classic content( features found in the original dvd release like, Story, Designs, Evolution, Building Humand, Easter Eggs, Character interviews, Building extras, etcAll in all this is a great set, I'm really happy that they added the feature with the storyboard crew( who I feel are the unsung heroes of animation ) and the other features that go into detail about the animation process. The round table with BIrd in co was informative in that it's a frank discussion on the trials they went through putting pen/pencil to paper through being told by a disney executive that it sucks. While some have complained about why add on this disc with this set it's great for those who don't have a blu ray player yet or in my case I have family and friends who don't and haven't seen this yet thanks to the addition of the dvd I had no problems lending it out( gave the free digital copy to a relative for their son's use ).For the price alone this is a great buy	5.0	Great release to a awesome movie	2011-04-16	5	4	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1A2SWJHNJ10FP	"Troy Kearney ""avid reader"""	"When I had heard that Disney and Pixar were teaming up again to release a new CGI animated release after the phenomenal success of Finding Nemo, I was interested to see what the two powerhouses would cook up.  After watching The Incredibles, I wasn't disappointed in the least.The film centers around Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), who is one of a group of ""supers"", heroes that live among the human populace who use their powers to save the world.  But one day when a routine rescue leads to massive damage and a series of lawsuits and a law from Congress hit Mr. Incredible and other supers, they are forced to go underground and never use their powers again.Over a decade later, Bob is living his life as an insurance salesman, married to Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and father to three young children, son Dashiell/Dash who (as implied by his name) can run fast (Spencer Fox), introspective daughter Violet who has the ability to throw invisible shields (Sarah Vowell) and youngest son Jack-Jack.  Unbeknownst to his family, Bob is doing some freelance hero action after getting fired for literally throwing his boss through a wall and word of it gets back to an interested individual that wants to hire Mr. Incredible.Only later do we learn that the ""interested individual"" is a new arch-nemesis named Syndrome that used to be the biggest fan of Mr. Incredibles 15 years earlier and wanted to help the hero, but was turned away.  He reveals that he plans to use a giant destructive robot that he created to get rid of any and all supers in the world so that he and only he can be the world's true hero, even if that means eliminating the one hero that he originally idolized in the process.When Helen learns of Bob's dalliances (thanks mostly to the person who designed every super's super-suit) she gets a suit of her own and heads to find her husband, only to learn that Dash and Violet are along for the ride.  Once the family are reunited it will take the ultimate team effort, including close family friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) to take down Syndrome and his evil plans and prove that heroism is a family affair.This film is definitely loaded with a lot of extras for those who want it, including an exclusive animated short, ""Jack-Jack Attack"", which is an extension of a scene where we see Jack-Jack in the care of the babysitter, Kari.  This made me howl a couple of times watching Kari try to react in dealing with...well, I won't give it away but it links up to something that our little one does at the end of the movie.Additional features include an amazingly extensive ""file"" on several of the supers in the film, a rather cheesy-looking ""classic"" Mr. Incredible cartoon (if you remember ""Clutch Cargo"", this is a total head trip), bloopers, an additional animated cartoon that originally was shown in theaters at the beginning of the film, deleted scenes and an alternate opening, and director commentary.Virtually, it seems that Disney and Pixar can do no wrong seeing as how this 1-2 punch has been batting 1.000 with their films (2 Toy Story movies, Monsters Inc., A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo and now The Incredibles).  Will ""Cars"" and ""Chicken Little"", both of which have trailers in the film and are expected to be the final 2 projects for the Disney/Pixar team, give them a perfect 8 for 8 hit streak?  Only time will tell, but for now, The Incredibles will have to be Disney and Pixar's crown jewel...at least until the release of The Incredibles 2...:)"	5.0	Incredible barely begins to describe this movie...	2005-03-29	2	1	1

They have all been so good that I am waiting for one to be a stinker.  This movie is not that movie.  I'll admit that I thought it drug a little bit in the middle, but by the end of the movie, I was absolutely thrilled.  When the family finally started using their super powers, it became a whole new movie and I really enjoyed it.  My favorite scenes were the ones where the Mom was using her powers.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	Pixar never disappoints us.  That's it, they proved it again, with this incredibly enjoyable film.  It is technically superb, but the most amusing part of the film is 'The Incredibles,' the superhero/heroine family that MUST live like ordinary people.The 2 hour film has a quite different beginning, which is about the good, old days of superheroes.  They were respected, always saving the day for the people of the town.  At least that's what they thought until the lawyers started to sue them for causing damages to the citizens.  This is a part that you may feel is slightly forced, but the real story begins after that.15 years later, the former superheroes are living 'protected' by the government, and a certain Mr. Parr formerly called Mr. Incredible is working for an insurance comapany.  He has now his own family, and each of them has his/her special powers though  they are all forbidden to use them.But one day a message arrives: 'Mr. Incredible: You're needed.'  When he accepts the invitation from the mysterious voice, another adventure begins ... not only for him, but for the entire family -- Mrs. Incredible, Violet, Dash, and even little baby Jack Jack.You see many excellent things tightly knit into a thrilling plot.  Interesting characters, amusing humor, stylish designs, and exciting actions are all there.  But the most impressive is the film's techinical aspect; in short, its images.  I liked 'The Polar Express' but felt that the Tom Hanks in that film looked a little weird sometimes.  You see no such elements that might detract your attention, for the film's CG images are seamlessly done without losing the wonderous touch that only the first-rate CGI can create.The voice cast include Craig T Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jason Lee.  Delightful costume desinger (whose attutudes reminded me of Edith Head) 'Edna Mode' has the voice of the film director Brad Bird himself, who gave us another classic 'The Iron Giant.'  (See that too!)The story gets a little conventional in the second half, but that is rather a wise choice for this kind of adventure film which is made for family viewing.  Watch it, and enjoy yourself.	5.0	Great Story, Great Designs, Great Characters:Just Incredible	2004-12-06	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3OBW7ZP7B1Y1N	T. VanPool	The Incredibles is one of the best animated films ever made.  It combines social satire (e.g., our overly litigious society, awards and honors given for virtually everything) with action and adventure.  The characters are compelling and the animation is absolutely out of this world!  I think that most people will identify with one or more of the characters, and they draw one into the movie, as opposed to acting as vacant vessels for the action.  I found that I really did care about the family by the movie's end.I note though that this movie may not be appropriate from some smaller children.  Although never shown on screen, this movie has people dieing all over the place (e.g., the drivers of the hovercrafts that crash, the various super heroes who fought the Omnidroid).  All of the violence is very comic bookish and most children may not pick up the implications of the implied events.  Still, a child with a quick mind easily could.  I found that I had to turn it off when my child came into the room while I was watching it; I could tell he was beginning to think too deeply about it...Still, this is a great movie that is entertaining for adults and older children.  I highly recommend it!	5.0	Absolutely Wonderful	2006-03-04	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	"Bob Parr is doing his best to live a normal life. He's got a wonderful wife, three beautiful kids, and a nice home in the suburbs. But Bob hates his job as an insurance claims representative. He sits in a tiny office (even more tiny for Bob because he's a big man and his office has this huge pillar going up one side) answering the phone, typing on a keyboard, and trying to actually help people who have problems. But, Bob's boss (a very tiny man) hates Bob because Bob agrees to almost every claim that is made. Bob also has another problem. Bob is actually a superhero: Mr. Incredible. He used to travel around the globe fighting off the forces of evil and standing up for those who couldn't stand up for themselves. Then some guy who he saved from committing suicide decided to sue and all of America's superheroes had to go underground. Things haven't been the same since.One day, Bob gets really mad at work and throws his boss through a wall. He's fired, but a mysterious stranger offers Bob to opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again and Bob jumps at the chance. At first things go fine. But then Mr. Incredible gets in over his head (you know, the whole ""I work best alone philosophy"" and ""I can't let my wife know I got fired"" attitude). Eventually his wife, who happens to be Elastigirl, and kids come to the rescue and it's up to the Incredible family to save the world.Simply put, THE INCREDIBLES are simply incredible. THE INCREDIBLES is one of the best of Pixar's hits. The voice talents perfectly cast with Craig T. Nelson voicing Mr. Incredible and Holly Hunter voicing his wife Elastigirl and Samuel L. Jackson as Increcible's best friend, Lucius Best--better known as Frozone.THE INCREDIBLES contains a great deal of action and some mild violence. As Helen/Elastigirl tells her children before she sets off to rescue Dad, the bad guys here aren't like the bad guys on television, the bad guys here will kill kids if they get a chance. Like FINDING NEMO before it, THE INCREDIBLES is an amazing story of family love. It's also a reflection on temperance; finding the balance between what you were made to do and what everyone else in the world wants you to do.THE INCREDIBLES was directed by Brad Bird. Previous to THE INCREDIBLES, Bird was best known for the animated film, THE IRON GIANT. Some of the same ideas dealt with in that movie are also dealt with in THE INCREDIBLES, but in a totally different fashion with a totally different setting and cast of characters. Bird also wrote the screenplay. In the movie there are clear influences from several great action films of the past, including STAR WARS. THE INCREDIBLES also resembles the graphic novel THE WATCHMEN by Alan Moore in some aspects, but in a very family-friendly way.The animated short included with the major feature is entitled BOUND. It's a story told in ballad about a proud sheep who is humbled after his first sheering, but is given a new look on life by a wise jackalope. Thank goodness there are jackalopes.Overall, THE INCREDIBLES is a great family movie. Watch it, then go hug your kids, call your parents, or re-acquaint yourself with that family member you haven't talked to in years."	5.0	Now, That's Incredible!	2012-06-04	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3373I4II32NA1	Tyler	This is the ultimate superhero movie, consisting of two superhero parents that have been banned into normalcy by the U.S. government and three kids that have somehow inherited powers of their own---a confused teenage girl who can make herself invisible and also create force fields that can't be breached, a growing boy that can almost break the sound barrier, and isn't allowed to enter any sporting events due to his speed, and an infant that doesn't seem to be anything but normal until his surprising transformation at the very end.The dad is depressed with his BS job dealing with insurance policies and who is allowed to use their policy, according to his whiny boss, and likes to secretly monitor police CB's to help anyone who can be in trouble themselves. When his job falls into a rut, he is suddenly contacted by an agent working for an anonymous boss that needs his help with a few assignments at three times his regular salary. Everything goes according to plan and Mr. Incredible feels like he's getting the best out of the bargain until he finds out that his next assignment is really a trap and his employer is a bitter-maliced guy who gave himself superpowers, including a bitter past with Mr. Incredible in his youth.The only ones that can save Mr. Incredible turns out to be the members of his family, which soon come to the rescue in a series of exploding planes, erupting rockets, and battling bad guys on hovercraft vehicles at great speeds. The entire movie is completely packed with action, explosions, and one flying RV that manages to wreck itself at high speeds without harming any members of the family in return. Boo-yah! And let's not mention the bowling-ball robot that can move at high speeds and wreck Army tanks at the same time. This movie is super-cool!	5.0	The Incredibles are simply incredible!	2010-12-26	1	1	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AHJ5FLIDAK7QC	Valjean	Reviewing this film by systematically plowing through its plot or describing its characters makes about as much sense as describing the taste of fine wine or the sound of exquisite music; there is plainly too much going on here to encapsulate in a quick review. If the idea of a family of superheroes--forced to hide their talents (and thereby their very identities) from an ungrateful public--who band together to fight a rival driven by hysterical envy appeals to you, then please just see it.  I virtually guarantee you won't be disappointed.Just as we celebrate Walt Disney as a visionary in hand-drawn animation, I boldly predict that Pixar Studios will someday receive equal acclaim for combining computer-based animation with bold, exciting, and subversive storytelling. This latest example of their genius--ironically distributed by Disney--somehow made well north of $250 million (as of this review's publication) from a public long-soaked in irrational cultural myths that this story triumphantly satirizes; among them:* 'Everyone is special'* 'Individual identity and talents mean nothing compared to the collective good'* 'Family love and dedication are overvalued (at best)'* 'Fighting for your values is an outdated and quaint notion'* 'When in doubt, litigate'I seriously doubt the antidotes to this nonsense--clearly shown throughout this film's storyline--could have been dramatized today by a major Hollywood release in non-animated form. But there's the rub: 'The Incredibles' is so, well, incredible that it *had* to be animated and computer use plays beautifully to its strengths (superhuman feats, wildly improbable action sets). Director Brad Bird (whose brilliant 'The Iron Giant' was fumbled by an inept Warner Bros. back in 1999) and his cohorts have every reason to smile about pulling a true Fast One.And while reactionary Hollywood may have held its collective nose while viewing this film and absorbing its lessons, they'll surely not ignore the box office receipts. As a mogul noted long ago, Hollywood is fundamentally non-political and irreligious; the only god they know is money. May 'The Incredibles' inspire a rich liturgy.	5.0	Sorry, everyone is *not* special	2005-05-22	0	0	0

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3U0MJLZ216VHW	viewless nebula	I owned this movie on DVD - but for some reason, every dvd version I've owned (because I've had to buy several copies) has a very odd skip-transition in a very specific place in the movie. It's not readily noticeable unless you look for it (and I won't mention it in case that ruins it for you), but once you find it, the skip is absolutely maddening.So, with hope, I bought the blu-ray combo pack, thinking that this problem would be solved on both the DVD and the blu-ray disc. I still have the problem on the normal DVD, but the blu-ray plays PERFECTLY and this problem isn't on the digital copy either. YAY!(Ultimately I've chalked it up to an odd encoding/disc-reading type error on the regular DVD, possibly as a result of the way the chapters are divided and the way the scene transitions, as it's been very consistent in EVERY normal DVD I've bought of this movie, including the DVD that came in this package.)I also might add that this film looks even MORE spectacular in blu-ray! :)	5.0	Love the movie!

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A25JGP7NBKYPUK	Violet CLM	"Let's face it. If you know who the Fantastic Four are, you already know what this movie is about. It's about a family of super heroes fighting a generic villain with little character development. The mother (who for some reason has Reed's powers) tries to pretend to know the other characters, but there is no connection between anyone else, and what there is lifted from Spy Kids.The Incredibles may be meant as a parody, but it feels too much like a watered down version of the original to be a working parody. I could pick up an issue of the Fantastic Four and get more character, better use of perfectly useful powers, an infinitely superior villain and more humor. I'm not sure if anyone in the theatre laughed once at this movie, except maybe a little girl in the row behind.The main characters of the movie are a married couple accidentally introducing their male and female children to a world of action and advanced technology. I could be describing Spy Kids and you'd never have guessed. Actually, a lot of things I could say about Spy Kids would also apply to this movie. Except things like ""Interesting characters"".Anyway, the mother has stretching powers (Mr. Fantastic from the FF), the father has super strength (Thing from the FF), the daughter has invisibility and force fields (Invisible Girl from the FF) and the son has super speed, which might be Quicksilver but is probably the Flash, judging by the color scheme. Franklin Richards also makes a few appearances for those of you who read the original comics, and other cameos can be seen of Super Girl, Cyclops, Ice Man (about as uninteresting as the movie gets) and various other people.Rounding off this unappealing package of potential lawsuit is an animation style which fails to invoke any mental image besides ""clay. lots of clay."" Rarely does character animation look less lifelike than in the Incredibles, which is odd because the backgrounds aren't actually all that bad.Who should see this movie? If you've never read comic books or seen action movies, you won't notice that everything here is long since overused, but if you do neither of those, the movie isn't going to be your style. I really don't know. I went inside expecting a good movie and was disappointed."	3.0	Any issue of the Fantastic Four, but not as interesting	2004-11-10	25	2	23
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A14MRJMPYTEF31	Virtualmonk	"Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"" had a wonderfully unabashed pro-fatherhood message.  ""The Incredibles"" has a fantastic, unashamed pro-family message.No spoilers here.  If you have read other reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, you know the basic storyline by now.Yes, the realistic violence of the action scenes warranted a ""PG"" rating, but the language is squeaky clean, there's no sexual innuendo that I could find (except one comment made by the villain near the end of the film, and it is by today's standards v-e-r-y mild if not downright playful), and any ""adult"" references or scenes are actually very positive comments on a healthy marriage and family life.There are those who, for whatever reason (their own political/cultural agenda and/or their own axe to grind), will either downgrade this movie or pan it altogether.  That is a shame.  The folks at Pixar deserve to be praised for ""The Incredibles"".  This was a risky project.  So far, it looks like the risk has paid off, and I'm glad it has.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1C80B497LCYKA	"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark"""	Maybe I'm a sucker for early 60's retro styling, which is what the look of this film is based on. Or maybe I'm a sucker for super heroes. Maybe I like almost everything that comes out of Pixar inordinately. Or maybe I like the 60's style jazz they use for the music - especially at the end. Maybe I just like James Bond type movies, with all the gadgets and exotic locations - and there are plenty in this movie. Or maybe I love modern architecture and design. Maybe I just like the color red! I don't know - but this movie really worked on me, and it was great!Director Brad Bird has brought together all these elements, plus good writing, funny dialog, and enough suspense and surprise to keep you on the edge of your seat. If you're into the visual elements, your eyes will have a feast. Now that I think of it, so will your ears because, besides the music, the sound effects are awesome. What's really incredible is that you feel like the physical objects in this movie are real. Like Mr. Incredible's (Bob's) car - after it's been downsized to a normal, economy car - which is featured in several gags. It looks and moves like a real - albeit, toy  - car, complete with broken door. Same for most things in this film.There is a possible disappointment to the realism: the people don't look like flesh and blood, which you might expect in a world that, otherwise, seems so real. They look like animated dolls with rubber skin. But, somehow, that's okay. You kind of buy into the fact that these are cartoon characters rather than real people. And yet, I would love to take their place in some of those high tech environments - especially on the island where Syndrome hangs out.Something else that disappoints a bit: Syndrome. I couldn't get past the fact that he looked like a kid even after he had grown up. It's hard to take seriously or be threatened by a villain that looks like a kid. But maybe that's the point: the filmmakers have their tongues in their cheeks. Which is probably true of most of this film. It is definitely a spoof - but not totally. If you're a kid at heart, you'll be taking a lot of it more seriously than you think.All the characters are memorable, but I've got to say, besides Mr. Incredible, my favorite is Baby Jack. There just wasn't enough of him in the film to suit me; so I was glad the filmmakers provided an additional cartoon featuring him on the DVD. It's really funny.Even though this film was mostly about the art and design for me, that is not to suggest that the plot, dialogue, voice acting and other aspects aren't up to par: they are. That's why the movie is so darn funny and so entertaining. Craig Nelson (Mr. Incredible), Holly Hunter (Elastigirl), Samuel L. Jackson (Frozone), Jason Lee (Syndrome), plus the others all did incredible jobs.It's hard to think of a better word to describe this film than its title: incredible. It may not be quite as remarkable as Toy Story, which will always hold a special place in Pixar-lovers' hearts. But in many ways it is better, and certainly holds its own with the other offerings of the Pixar team. Those guys, themselves, seem pretty incredible to me.Waitsel Smith	5.0	INCREDIBLE - BUT YOU HAVE TO HOLD YOUR MOUTH IN THE RIGHT POSITION	2005-09-12	3	2	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"It's rare that a movie lives up to its title. ""The Incredibles"" does precisely that by combining the excitement of the 60's Bond films, superhero epics and the dysfunctional American family. Taking place in a world drawn from the 60's (and how we viewed the future then), ""The Incredibles"" allows Brad Bird (""The Iron Giant"") to pursue his unique vision as a film director. His style energizes the Pixar approach to animation allowing the studio to rival the more manic energy of Dreamworks while staying true to the character driven stories that make Pixar's films unique.When superheroes are driven underground by lawsuits, the ""Supers"" as they are called begin life as ordinary Americans. Unfortunately, the temptation of saving people seduces one of America's greatest superheroes Bob Parr/ Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) back into the ring of fighting evil. When a company contacts Mr. Incredible to help them stop a robot that has started thinking for itself on an isolated Pacific island Mr. Incredible resumes fighting evil despite the wishes of his superhero wife Helen Parr/ Elastigirl (Holly Hunter). With her two children (each of whom has their own unique powers) in tow, Helen goes after Bob believing that he's having an affair, or worse has gone back to fighting crime and risking their family in the process.Another ""Super"" transfer from Disney and Pixar, the Academy Award winning ""The Incredibles"" really was one of the highlights of last year. The bright, vivid cartoon colors and sharp images create a convincing world for this family of superheroes. I found the transfer to be virtually flaw free and the resolution to be, well, incredible. Likewise, the active and imaginative soundmix remains a highlight on home video as well. This is an example of perfectly capturing the original theatrical experience as close as possible and transferring it to the home environment. The only thing missing was the commercials we see all too frequently (and which should be banned from theaters I might add), overpriced popcorn and giant boxes of candy you'll never be able to finish.Once again we get an action packed group of extras on the second disc of this two DVD set. Two original shorts debut here. ""Jack Jack Attack"" shows exactly what happened to the babysitter during those horrified and frantic sounding phone calls to Helen/Elastigirl. It's just as funny as the feature. We also get ""Mr. Incredible and Pals"" a short cartoon that emulates those funky 1960's TV series (like ""Captain Fathom"" and ""Clutch Cargo"") where they used minimum animation, funky graphics and footage of real human lips matted on to the characters. It's corny and a lot of fun. This cartoon also has a tongue-in-cheek commentary track from Mr. Incredible and Frozone the two featured superheroes in the cartoon. The charming Pixar short ""Boundin'"" which played with the movie appears here as well. We also get deleted scenes and alternate an alternate opening sequence in various stages of completion. The alternate opening which is presented in its storyboard format features commentary by Brad Bird explaining what the thought process was behind the sequence and why it was abandoned. ""Incredi-Blunders"" features various animation mistakes that occurred during the making of the film. They vary from characters missing everything but their teeth, eyes and hair to uncoordinated sequences where the costumes are missing are move out of alignment with the characters.The first ""Making of"" featurette runs about 27 minutes and provides us with a comprehensive look into the difficulties Bird and his crew faced making the movie.  The second ""Making of"" featurette is composed of smaller parts provide information about the making of this great movie from conception to alternate storylines and the final product. Combined they run about 70 minutes.  We start with the story by Brad Bird with excerpts from Bird's video diary while writing the script, interviews during production and after. You'll understand why it takes a couple of years to create a film of this caliber.  Story Supervisor Mark Andrews shows us the storyboarding process and we see how he and director/writer Bird interact.  ""Vowellet"" who plays Violet in the movie discusses what she does on the side such as writing a history book ""Assassination Vacation"" discussing the assassination of various American Presidents. It's actually pretty funny and entertaining. ""Making of The Incredibles"" and ""More Making of The Incredibles"" gives us a glimpse into the creation of the various characters with the animators discussing the difficulty in making the characters come alive. We also get a glimpse into the various unfinished animatics, and the animation at various levels of creation. The ""Music"" portion of this 40 minute ""featurette"" is the most fascinating more me as the composer managed to recall the classic spy themes of the 60's and 70's without imitating them. We hear comments from the various musicians involved in the session along with the composer discussing the challenges and fun of making music of this sort with a glimpse into the scoring session. Brad Bird discusses the biggest challenge of the film-the scale of it which is not unlike a Bond film in terms of creating the environments. Brad Bird himself did the voice for Edna and it's pretty funny to hear the voice and see the character. Clearly the character combines Yoko Ono with Bette Midler and costume designer Edith Head and also manages to steal the film in every scene she's in. Bill Wise one of the technical supervisors discusses how difficult it was to create the characters for the crowd scenes.Brad Bird discusses how he immediately tried to subvert audience expectations in making ""The Incredibles"" and tried to make the film an unusual project from the very beginning. Bird sets up the opening sequence as larger than life (both in the golden hued color to the actions that occur) to contrast with Bob and Helen's life much later on. Bird reveals, for example, that Jason Lee played Buddy both as an adult and as a child altering the way that Lee spoke with Protools (a computer program that allows you to record and alter digital recordings) and by having Lee raise his voice half an octave. All sorts of fascinating bits from Bird and producer Walker crop up throughout the commentary from influences to visual tributes to other movies and mediums.The main animators discuss the difficulty in animating a much more physical film like an action-adventure movie. The amount of detail and types of motions are much, much more complex and forced the animators to develop new techniques and new software to make those moves realistic. The animators are also quite frank about the budget and time difficulties that they faced in creating the ""universe"" around the main characters. Evidently the animators used all the same models to create the background characters slightly manipulating the nose, chin and head here or there to create credible background characters that don't all look the same. They also discuss the variations from the actual storyboards and where inspiration struck (such as ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"") as inspiration for certain sequences.A great American film (not just a great animated film), ""The Incredibles"" got the deserved recognition with an oscar. It's the best, most intense and original CGI animated cartoons produced to date. It's also helped Pixar reinvent itself yet again by NOT duplicating previous successes. Bird demonstrated his special talents in the film ""The Iron Giant"" and he continues to break new ground in storytelling. Packed with a second disc of great extras, you'll learn more than you ever wanted to know about the making of this classic film. Here's hoping Bird will continue to break new ground and help keep Pixar fresh."	5.0	Lives up to its title	2005-03-04	14	10	4

I've seen most Pixar productions and they've all been fair, if not a bit too family-oriented for me. So after the gobs and gobs of good press (and it being directed by Iron Giant's Bird) I bought it on a whim. My reaction? AMAZING!! I LOVE the glorious art direction, the sheer DETAIL, the frenetic action sequences are dazzling and had me gasping for air, the casting (especially the always wonderful Holly Hunter), the inventiveness and creativity...it was TOTALLY thrilling. The feared ""family"" themes - what kept me away from the theater in the first place - were kept in check and not overdone. Not only that but Sam Jackson - once again - gives yet ANOTHER great performance. It's presented in 2.40:1 widescreen, which is a perfect choice. It is so cool to see animated features being given the ""scope"" treatment - I hope it's a trend that continues. This may be the best looking dvd I've ever seen. On my OLD Sony, it damn near passes for HD-quality, with some of the most stunning clarity and image detail I've ever seen. Particularly mind-blowing are all of the chase scenes, which were flat-out MESMERIZING. Needless to say, I WILL BE THERE when a sequel comes out!!"	5.0	Surprised even ME	2005-03-22	4	3	1

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"There's little to be said that hasn't already been said about this terrific movie. Not only is it (vastly) technically superior to the CGI offerings from other studios (and a significant improvement even on Pixar's previous offerings), but it again proves that Pixar understands what makes a great film -- story, story, story. The story is character-driven, not plot-driven, a point most Hollywood film makers seem to have forgotten. The characters have believable personalities, legitimate problems, and interact in plausible ways.Which brings me to a point that _hasn't_ been addressed by many reviewers. The PG rating notwithstanding, the insistance of the filmmakers on treating the material in a fundamentally serious way (which has been true of _all_ Pixar feature films) makes ""The Incredibles"" a _very_ dark film. Though we never see a verifiable on-screen death, most of Syndrome's minions are offed (directly or indirectly) by the Parrs, usually in an explosion or crash. We later learn that Syndrome is a serial killer, having murdered at least a dozen superheroes. And Syndrome himself perishes when he's ground up in the jet engine of his own plane (though this is off-camera, as well).Leaving the theater, I asked a father if he thought ""The Incredibles"" veered dangerously close to being PG-13, and -- to my surprise -- he agreed. ""The previews were all of the funny stuff."" (The hysterical scene of an oversized Mr. Incredible trying to get into an undersized super-suit is not in the film.)The reason for the ""real"" (though mostly unshown) violence of ""The Incredibles"" is likely the result of the tendency over the last two decades to treat science-fiction and fantasy stories as if they were character-driven dramas (qv, Xena). This is good, because it makes for engaging and believable story-telling. But it also means the villains have to be much nastier -- more like Hannibal Lecter than Captain Hook. ""Real"" characters need ""real"" threats (qv, ""A Bug's Life"").""The Incredibles"" is a surprisingly violent film, and I urge parents to think twice before taking kids much under 12."	5.0	Incredible in every way...	2004-11-22	3	3	0

Everything about this movie is perfect. The perfect visual effects, the score was amazing, Brad Bird directed this perfectly and was the voice of the funny Edna (who stole the show at parts in my opinion). Craig T. Nelson was the voice of the main character Bob and boy was he perfect for the role of our hero among all of the.. The supporting cast was great with great actors and actresses along the lines of Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jason Lee. Just shows you don't need all big names to make a good film.The plot of The Incredibles is simple to follow even with kids. People complained that it was not funny enough. Well if you are smart enough to know the type of humor than you would have known how funny that the movie actually was. This was actually an action film if you didn't notice. It was not only a comedy. That is why so many people may have been upset when they really should have noticed the true facts.This film is perfect for any age at all. Kids, teens, adults, etc. This film is smart, witty, fun and is just a great film.

Then, at the peak of Mr. Incredible's mid-life crisis, the call comes from a mysterious source, and --Well, a lot happens, but you'll see that for yourself.

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A38N7SFDOB3MR3	Wisconsin Dad	I admit that I was not attracted to this motion picture. I had no desire to watch it. Then my 6 year old asked if we could buy it on pay per view. And what is my opinion now that I've seen it? I love it! In fact, I would watch it again and again. It exceeded expectations. Mr. Incredible was hilarious.The Incredibles is a movie about a super hero that is forced into retirement but, alas, his heart is still with saving the world from danger. He heads to the suburbs where he takes a lame desk job (like the one I have). Occasionally he sneaks out to rescue someone from a fire, etc, but he does it behind his wife's back.Along the way Mr. Incredible has 3 incredible children who, of course, all have unique superpowers. Mr. Incredible inevitably gets drawn into peril, gets a new hero suit, and goes off to save the world against a very evil villain. (I won't spoil you with clues as to who it is). Mr. Incredible's family joins him in this adventure, and the world is restored to happiness.The Incredibles is a movie for all ages. The humor is actually humorous, and I found myself laughing out loud many times. The Incredibles are not crude or obnoxious other than the kids having an occasional verbal scuffle. In general the movie is immersive, flows very well, and makes 90 minutes seem like 30.	5.0	I was so ...INCREDIBLY...unprepared	2005-08-02	3	2	1

This medium is awesome. It is easy to see but Brad's commentary verifies that this depicts the conflict between mediocrity and the extraordinary. There is more than a touch of the moral that enforcing the mediocre and squashing elite physical excellence is bad. Telling the excellent to ""run as fast as you can"" even if to deliberately come in a ""close second"" is what it takes for us to reach collective excellence. The evil robot set loose on the city is no match for human excellence even though it learns and has been taught by the best. It even has a remote control - controlled by the evil one set loose because his own drive for excellence was quashed by his hero. Guilt. (But note that this is an ""intellectual excellence"" one representing invention and reflection instead of innate physical power. Even more worrisome is that the moral taught here is that unrestrained intellectual excellence ignores the good and is depicted as naturally creating evil instead of good in pursuit of power. Uncontrolled technological innovation leads to evil! Super strength should be used. Super intellect should be squashed or at least mentored. A law of mediocrity -- Supers are not allowed to procreate! (Viewing Jack-Jack attack is a must!) Using super powers will just come naturally to you - no training needed, just practice. But without practice you become fat and need a new suit.Special note on the benefit of watching the extras included in the double disk set: what a fantastic way to learn about the development of something like this! Imagine if we had the thoughts of a Michelangelo as he was pondering though some of his work. (Do we? Not just his love poetry: ""Nostro intelletto dalla carne inferma e tanto oppresso, che `l morrir piu spiace..."") You can see growth and improvement. Such insight into the mind of an artist is well worth watching the movie and then the ""Outtakes"". You gotta see the ""Jack Jack Attack"". It is 4 minutes plus of pure delight!

I got the showtime, and while I had the paper open, I decided to look at the reviews.  They gave The Incredibles 3 stars which they translated to See the movie if you have time.  I had time, so I went to the movie.  After a long and stupid animated short about a dancing and jumping sheep, the actual movie started.The Incredibles was about a superhero named Mr. Incredible.  He marries another superhero named Elastigirl, and then Mr. Incredible saves someone who didn't want to be saved, and gets sued for it.  Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, as well as all other superheros are forced by the government to give up their lives as superheros and live a normal life.  15 years later you meet up with Mr. and Mrs. Incredible again with Mr. Incredible an insurance salesman.  Elastigirl a stay at home mom, and their three kids, Dash, Violet, and Jack Jack, are normal kids going to school, only they have super powers.  Mr. Incredible then gets fired from his job because he wants to save someone from getting mugged and his boss won't let him, so Mr. Incredible throws his boss through multiple walls.  Mr. Incredible doesn't tell his wife about this, and then gets contacted by a company that want's his services as a superhero.  He accepts and tells Elastigirl he's going on a business trip.  He gets captured by a villian and gets in some trouble and I'm stopping here so I don't give away the rest of the story.What did I think of the movie?  I thought it was better than all of the live action superhero movies that I've seen.  I liked it many times more than Spiderman, and I liked spiderman a lot.  Even though it was animated, it didn't lose anything.  The effects were probably more realistic because they didn't distort any real people.

Nonetheless, it is still a nice one to have.	4.0	I like it, but not too much about the accent	2013-05-14	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2A74PUN0CGKK8	xyz	This movie came with both discs, so nothing was missing. However, the dvd case was slightly damaged. One side of the dvd holder was broken so the dvd fell out when I opened up the case. But other than that, the discs work fine.	4.0	Good, but slightly damaged case	2011-04-01	0	0	0
7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A29FP47A13W3ND	"Y. Collins ""yodi1"""	"""The Incredibles"" deserves every accolade it has received.  It is quality family entertainment!  A mid-life crisis has NEVER been this entertaining.  Helen Parr/Mrs. Incredible has REDEFINED the word ""Supermom"".  What a woman!  All the characters showed great courage, and I think it translates to the children watching the movie better than in more recent G- and PG-rated studio efforts.  And, of course the lesson about being special or average was not lost. This movie was never predictable or cliche in any way at any time (well, except for two seconds at the end when Mr. Incredible pulls his shirt open to reveal his supersuit underneath, but that one gets a pass).I purchased this movie on DVD the day it was released, and now I think we're grinding grooves into it from watching it so much.  The two-disc set is more than worth the price, whatever you pay for it!If PIXAR's quality was ever becoming questionable, then they have officially eliminated any ambiguity.  ""The Incredibles"" confirms PIXAR's place at the top of the heap for computer animation; the movie is a stroke of SHEER GENIUS!"	5.0	Disney and PIXAR have done it again!	2005-03-22	1	1	0

I have 35+MBps on my home network and stream through multiple other browsers and hosts, never had an issue. This was a waste of 4 dollars. I just went to the store ans ended up buying it on sale for 10.	1.0	Slow Slow Speeds	2014-03-10	9	1	8

7883704591	The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"The legacy of the Disney/Pixar film collection will always (at least to me) be its ability to completely engross/entertain children and adults alike in a single sitting.  While ""The Incredibles"" will suck in the kiddies again as usually, this time the adults are left out a bit.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), a former superhero who is now adjusting to family life with wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), also a former hero.  Instead of saving the world and fighting bad guys, they are now raising their three children Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and Jack-Jack the baby.  When a new baddie comes into the picture, however, the ""old crew"" (plus a few new ""kids"") is needed once again.In terms of action and adventure, the ""Incredibles"" is as good as any previous Disney effort.  It is full of color and spectacle and will have the kids hooked within minutes.  In this aspect, it is a very successful endeavor.The ""trouble"" with this film, though, is that the characters just aren't as well-developed as other fare.  For example, when you watch movies like ""Finding Nemo"" or even ""Tangled"", you really feel as if you are invested in the characters and their exploits.  In ""The Incredibles"", though, the characters are just present and not quite as well-developed.Perhaps the only caveat to the above paragraph is that if you have a family, the themes for ""The Incredibles"" might hit a little close to home.  Though I myself come from a large family, I do not have a family of my own, and thus have not had to go through the types of trials and humorous situations that this movie portrays.Thus, my experience with ""The Incredibles"" was an uneven one in the end.  I could appreciate some of the jokes and sight gags, but I never was really able to ""buy in"" to the characters to the extent of other past Disney works."	3.0	A Bit Uneven And Lacking The Usual Pixar Strong Characters	2013-03-19	3	1	2

Even for being one of the earlier Pixar films, it looks fantastic and the BluRay compliments it further.	5.0	Great Movie with Dark Undertones	2013-11-05	1	1	0
