B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A35DGWN9ATWJ1U	007	Gladiator is the best movie I have ever seen.  I was so impressed with the story, cinematography, acting, and special effects that when combined witht the action scenes and the attention to historical detail in Roman culture...I was blown away.  It is a powerful movie too.  Not to ruin the ending, but after a heroic battle, a few lines by Lucilla brought tears to my eyes.  It is a wonderful story about love, honor, revenge, and betrayal.  It is not short of political intrigue nor unfulfilled romance.Gladiator will not disappoint.  The bonus disk that comes in addition to the movie is superb and very insightful.  I would not recommend this movie for children as there are scenes that are quite graphic and there are incestuous overtones as well.&quot;What we do in life echoes in eternity.&quot;Darin	5.0	Greatest Movie I Have Ever Seen - 5 stars are not enough!	2000-12-26	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1ALOIPRR8Q06J	"2 cents ""meaningless memes"""	"A 5 Star ""sword and sandal"" summertime blockbuster fantasy/action flick and classic morality tale.Thinking of what throwaway title to use for the review I recalled the South Park crew's mockery of Crowe's accent in the film. But who knows or for that matter cares what a Spaniard sounded like a couple thousand years ago? Surely not like Crowe, but the Romans didn't speak English or look too much like many of the actors portraying them in Hollywood films! And who cares about actual history? Nobody watching ""Gladiator"". Except for the ""realistic fight scenes!"" and new digital depiction of Rome and it's Coliseum of death we aren't too concerned. Marcus Aurelius was a real Emperor, last of the so-called ""Five Good Emperors"", and a great stoic philosopher, but events depicted in the film are loosely based in fact or fabricated.However, I can appreciate ""Gladiator"" as a well-crafted morality tale of honor, loyalty, and betrayal with some cool fights. Director Ridley Scott has brought to us some of the most gorgeous films of the last 30+ years."	4.0	I'm a bloody Spaniard!	2009-07-22	2	1	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A231FGX8G2Q5EW	4EverYoung	"&lt;Complete excerpt from review on digitalbits.com> for which I wholey trust and respect the opinion of Bill Hunt, editor.Okay... so, I've seen Gladiator and Braveheart on Blu-ray this afternoon. I should let you know that I tried to get the discs from Paramount directly. They're usually very helpful and responsive in such situations, but they genuinely don't seem to have them available to send them out until early next week, for whatever reason. Given the controversy around the Net regarding the Gladiator transfer, however, I still wanted to be able to see the discs today myself - rather than comment on all this screenshot silliness - to make my own judgments and report here in time for you all to have fair warning prior to street date (9/1 - this coming Tuesday). It's your money, and you want to spend it wisely. You need information in order to do that.Let me first comment on the whole issue of screenshots. Judging a disc based on a few screenshots is, I think, silly. A screenshot represents 1/24 of a second of film. For a 2-hour film, that just 1/172,800th of the total visual information. You just can't properly judge a transfer based upon that little information. Screenshots CAN be illustrative of various kinds of image-related problems. But you really have to see the image in full motion to judge the complete context and impact of anything you see in a single frame grab. There's also the problem of potential alterations or artifacts that result from the frame-grabbing process itself, not to mention any changes resulting from image compression/editing software used by the poster - no matter how well intentioned - to present the frame-grab online. Finally, I've seen enough deliberately Photoshop doctored frame-grabs posted in discussion forums in my day that I just don't trust them. Ultimately, the only real way to judge these things properly is with your own eyes, first-hand, in context, in full motion, presented on proper equipment. Period.That being the case, an exhaustive search of retailers and rentailers in my area turned up a ""mom and pop"" rental shop nearby that had both Blu-ray titles available for rent prior to street date. I was able to pick up the discs this morning, and I've since gone through the transfers in some detail. I'm not going to talk about the extras - I'll do that in more detail next week, and I can tell you with confidence that the extras on both discs are absolutely first-rate. No complaints there whatsoever. As for the A/V quality, however, here's my two cents...Upon first glance, and as expected, the HD presentation quality of Gladiator isn't as bad as some online would have you believe. Color and contrast is fine at all times. The problem is with the level of detail. The vast majority of the film has a slightly digital-looking quality to it, and there's clear edge-enhancement ""haloing"" visible. The extended edition scenes, however, look fine - no halos, no digital patina - they're very natural looking. If the whole film looked like the extended scenes, we wouldn't be having this conversation. What it looks like to me, is that someone at Universal (keep in mind, it's Universal that controls the Gladiator assets for DreamWorks - not Paramount), decided to re-use the original digital master of the HD transfer done back in 2000 for the very first DVD release. Now, that transfer was state of the art for its day, and it was approved by director Ridley Scott, but obviously it's a far cry from the quality of new HD transfers done today, in 2009. One of the biggest problems is that until fairly recently, video mastering engineers were still applying edge-enhancement to their digital masters knowing that they were going to be used ultimately for standard-definition DVD release, and also analog VHS and laserdisc. It took the mastering community a long time to break the habit. In this Gladiator transfer, you can see it in the image. It's also clear that the 2000 digital master has been digitally-filtered to reduce the haloing and other artifacts - the signs of DNR are not hard to miss. That's in contrast to the extended edition scenes, which were transferred in HD in 2005 and so look much better. They're still not quite up to today's standards, but they look far superior to the rest of the film and there's no edge-enhancement or obvious filtering visible. The footage simply looks natural - as it should. There's been some talk of DNR being so excessive that - for example - arrows and fireballs disappear from one frame to the next. This IS an issue, but the fact is that when you watch the image in full motion it's not something you really notice. The arrow or fireball is highly visible in one frame, less so in the next, more so in the third, etc. You still detect the object in motion, so you don't go, ""Oh my god, that fireball just disappeared!"" The image just looks generally digital and lacking in fine detail. Overall, I would grade the A/V quality of the Gladiator Blu-ray thusly:GladiatorVideo: 15.5 (theatrical footage)/17 (extended scenes)Audio: 18Let me be clear: Gladiator on Blu-ray is quite watchable - especially if you have a smaller screen. On the comparative grading scale we use for Blu-ray, the very best DVD video and audio quality would be graded a 10. So it's definitely an improvement over the previous DVD releases. The problem is, the best Blu-rays - most high-quality titles on the format these days - score in the 18-19 range. So while this disc is watchable, that's just not good enough, either for the format as a whole or for most fans and enthusiasts"	2.0	bleech	2009-08-28	34	31	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ATAJ9LRGZOSI	"Aaishik Kar ""truthseeker"""	"""Gladiator"" is a film about one man's fight to rekindle the flame of a great idea on the verge of being completely extinguished.The great idea was Rome - one of Man's supreme efforts to realize the Ideal which mankind has ever striven to attain.But this ideal is lost under the rubble of political corruption, injustice and immorality.A man of courage and honor - General Maximus makes a promise to a dying Emperor, Marcus Aurelius that he shall salvage this great idea before it is lost forever, lost irrevocably to mankind.But before anything can be done, Maximus becomes a terrible victim of the socio-political system by which he has hitherto remained untouched, and at whose summit we behold a moral monster - Commodus - the son of Marcus Aurelius.From the position of a renowned military leader, this system pulls him down to its dregs - Maximus becomes a slave and a gladiator.Can a mere gladiator - who faces the prospect of a violent death every moment of his life - rise against the mighty Roman power and rescue mankind's greatest and grandest dream from remaining a dream forever?This is what ""Gladiator"", a magnificent, dramatic and compelling epic is all about.""Gladiator"" is unabashedly concerned with the projection of a positive hero whose stature remains undiluted to the very end.The performance by every character in the film, particularly Russell Crowe, is wonderful.A film replete with thrilling action, blood and gore, violence and suspense, ""Gladiator"" is not just an action-for-the-sake-of-action film.It has profoundly and undeniably important philosophical-metaphysical implications.This combination of a historic perspective with a definite political viewpoint; a metaphysical dimension with a grand sense of life; a truthful presentation of the eternal laws of human existence with the projection of moral values - integrated to a nail-biting,terrific and terrifying story - this superb combination makes ""Gladiator"" one of the best films of the recent times."	5.0	An epic that shall take your breath away	2002-12-20	2	1	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3G88J3OQWO5QR	Aaron A. Stange	Intresting thing about this movie is that people either love it or hate it. I found it to be one of the best movies I had seen in a while. Now I'm not saying this becuase i'm a guy and i like gory movies. This movie blew me over. It was brilliant in its mastery of reinacting the life of a gladiator and furthermore it had some of the most powerful speeches and thought provoking ideas that I have heard since braveheart. I give this movie 5 stars and I'm sorry that I couldn't give it 6.	5.0	Gladiator Movie of the Year?????	2000-10-19	24	19	5

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A19XY14J27WCOG	Aaron	A predictable &quot;ride&quot; as maximus, the big strong, chisel-jawed hero, climbs his way up the ladder of opposition and difficulty, defeats his enemy, and gets to see his wife, in slow-motion, to some cheesy music.  The universally evil and reprehensible Emperor sure made a good villain.  No reason to sympathise for him at all.  The best scenes, in my opinion, were such simply because of the difficulty of the production.  For example, the battle bewteen Germanic tribes and Roman Legionnaires.  Amazing battle. The scene amazed me, simply because i have not witnessed anything of that nature.If hollywood can't make something original, or believable, then it shouldn't make anything at all.  there are plenty of fine films that have already been made.Good set design and costume dosen't make a good movie.  Case in point: Titanic. Oh, but it makes money, i forgot about capitalism.The movie was so incredibly tedious, it's very very hard, to give it a second viewing without simply fast forwarding to the action sequences..... which would belabor the question &quot;why did i pay for all the scenes i don't want to watch?&quot;Want to see a good movie with elabourate sets and costume?  Barry Lyndon.  Want to see a good 'journey of the hero' movie?  see lawrence of arabia.  Don't waste your money patronizing Ridley Scott.  He's fallen very far and in the process ended up dumbing down his &quot;art&quot; so far that every single Macho Man enjoys it.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A102F6U8LL6Y9	Aaron Latimer	With the exception of &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, and &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; there isn't a better epic motion picture.  The battle scene at the beginning of the film is so impressive and realistic it will give you chills.  From watching how the Roman soldiers are assembled on the battlefield to how they devastate their enemy, every sequence is done with historical accuracy.  It gives you a true sense of what made the Roman Empire so powerful.  The film is extremely graphic in its battle sequences, but how else is a director supposed to give the viewer a true sense of what it must have really been like to live in such a savage age.  The story is tremendously gripping and sucks you into Maximus' (the main character) life in such a way that you feel vindicated at the movie's climax.  &quot;Gladiator&quot; is one of my all time favorite movies and I honestly can't wait to own this 2 disk collection.	5.0	Absolutely Astonishing	2000-10-11	9	7	2

I just hope that the Academy doesn't have their heads up their &quot;you know where&quot; when Oscar time comes around.  The acting is top quality, the story is great, and the score is Hans Zimmer's best to date!  Original and haunting at the same time.  The tension and suspence are timed perfect with the pace of the film.  And lets not forget the the visual aspect of this film.  Amazing is a good description!  Kudos to the Director of Photography.

The days of the Roman Empire were brought to life in full color and sound, and for a short time I was allowed the priviledge of living in one of the most exciting times in world history.  I bore witness to a man engaged in an age-old struggle between good and evil, and when all the odds were seemingly against him, he eventually emerged victorious. My girlfriend also enjoyed the movie immensely, and she reflects upon it from time to time.  It is now one of our treasured topics of discussion, and to be able to share such precious intellectual time with a loved one is priceless.&quot;Gladiator&quot; is destined to become a cinema classic.	5.0	Destined to be a classic	2000-11-24	1	1	0

I must see this again.  There is so much happening that is beautiful.  There is so much happening that provokes thought.  I cannot take it all in in one sitting.  I will enjoy this first viewing for what it's worth, and then I must see this again.&quot;Some people just don't know when they're conquered&quot;--said by a Roman centurian in resplendent battle dress about a barbarian war lord's defiant flinging of the severed head of a felled Roman into the middle of the advancing Romans' camp.  Then followed the volley of fire and the hefting of bladed steel and the snapping of German Shepherd teeth.  Then flowed the rivers of blood and fire and brightly colored banners.  The glory and pomp of war, the horror.  But who are the real barbarians?  Again.A general who loves a king, a king who loves his sister, a slave who defies his heart and his master, but keeps his promise.  Again.An African, a German (Germanian, anyway), a Spaniard, banding together to slay the sweetly charioted Amazons.  The devil is in the details.  Look closely and quickly, for it goes fast.  See?  The black Amazon has only one breast!  As a teacher of English and a student of the language, I love this one.  The word &quot;Amazon&quot; comes from the Latin words &quot;A&quot; (no, or without) and &quot;Mas&quot; (breast, as in MASectomy).  So &quot;Amazon&quot; means literally &quot;without breast.&quot;  The legend is that each Amazon warrior cut off a breast so that it would not interfere with her shooting of arrows.  Again.Maximus versus the undefeated gladiator.  Maximus de&quot;feet&quot;s him.  Ouch.  Watch out for the tigers!  Again.See this movie again.  And again.	5.0	Again	2001-10-13	2	2	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	"The film shows Imperial Rome winning a battle in the Black Forest. But wasn't that one of the few battle Rome lost? Rome's economy was based on slavery; they had to continually conquer new lands to replenish the cheap labor needed for their plantations, owned by the rich and politically connected ruling class. Sort of like today's corporations, except now the conquest of foreign lands means there is no need to import cheap labor; they send the factories there.After the battle we see some high level intrigue among the leaders. The speech of a tired old Caesar (""End the corruption, Restore the Republic"") suggests the leader is senile. Handing power to a popular military leader is the antithesis of a republic! And so the stage is set for personal conflict, a simplified way to explain economic and political conflict.The General rejects the new Emperor's hand, and is rejected in turn. He escapes execution, his family does not. Somehow he winds up in North Africa (?) without crossing the sea. (Does his travails remind you of 'Yojimbo'?) Then the gladiator scenes follow - to remind you of professional sports? He is told that popularity makes the star, not statistics!The special effects recreate ancient cities, but the lack of movement in the backgrounds tell. Do some of the scenes remind you of 'Star Wars""? Or some of those costume imports from forty-plus years ago? Like many other films, the action picks up when the story line lags. Do rulers still use circuses to entertain and distract the masses from their problems? Only in other countries.Caesar and Maximus both expire, but they don't say what their replacements do. This seems like the sickest movie since 'Silence of the Lambs', and appears to have done as well at the box office.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A33L7G4E8CID3	"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19"""	This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time. It tells the tale of one Maximus Decimus Meridius, a Spanish General of the Roman Army in the year 180 A.D. After winning a great battle against the barbarians, the old king, Marcus Aurelius (played by Richard Harris), decides to make this brilliant general the Caesar of Rome upon his death. He says that he will be ideal because he has not been corrupted by Rome's politics. However, Aurelius's son, Commodus, Maximus's friend, is jealous at the Spaniard and kills his father, and thus he seizes control of the Roman Empire. He orders Maximus and his wife and son killed. Maximus kills nearly half a dozen soldiers and escapes, but his family is crucified. After he escapes, he is captured by a man who organizes gladiator fights to turn a profit. Maximus was to participate in one of these events; he won. Not only by staying alive did he achieve victory, but he also won over the crowd. Then he is sent to Rome, where he has his chance to fight back at the emperor who killed his wife and son. The acting is excellent all around, especially Crowe and Phoenix. The scenery and costumes are all outstanding, bringing the Roman Empire to life. The DVD is simply amazing, with great sound and picture quality, plus deleted scenes. This movie is nothing less than a classic; an epic. It is definitely worth purchasing here.A fine combination of literate messagery and light entertainment.

The visual effects of this movie are outstanding, but nothing can compare to Star Wars  Episode I. The movie mainly talks about Russell Crowe, (I forgot his name)  who starts out having a wife and a son, and is apart of a war, which he and  his men win. After the war, the king of Rome (Joaquin Phoenix) finds out  about this &quot;Gladiator&quot;, and for some odd reason, that I forgot,  the king kills his wife and son. The Gladiator finds out that his family is  dead, and decides to go into a championship of fighting, along with other  men, to compete to be able to fight in the Coliseum. One of the fighters,  who is apart of the Gladiator's group, is Djimon Hounsou from the movie  &quot;Amistad&quot;. Once the Gladiator wins the fights, he finally arrives  in the Coliseum, and does a lot of fighting against man and beast. The king  is very jealous that the Gladiator is winning all these fights, and  finally, at the end of the movie, fights him, and ofcourse, looses, and  dies. The really awesome thing about this movie is the visual effects, the  action, and the acting; this movie is a complete work of art!	5.0	AWESOME!	2000-09-20	1	0	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A18BD98SU49UB7	"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H."""	Goodbye, to another hard hit-negative review. Here is the revision of a review written months ago. Gladiator is a delivery of a story told in the form of many movies, but not in character. Maximus is a man troubled with loves past and desires nothing but to go home once the barbarians are destroyed. Before granting his wish the Emporer asks him to take rule of Rome, Leaving his own son without a throne. Joaquin Pheonix plays a terrific sadistic maniac that would do anything to claim the throne, even kill his own father. What starts out as a terrific victory, Gladiator follows Maximus' decent from the heights of high protector of Rome, to a slave in chains. Gladiator was the #1 movie of 2000 at the box office, which shows that many people were drawn to the story. Many viewings later on my own dvd, I say it is a good movie. Catch the scene when Maximus prays to God. We need more scenes of humility like that in todays cinema.	5.0	Ende!	2001-02-23	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A8TCAEBMUQ3VP	"""adidas21012"""	The movie Gladiator is a good one and has a good plot. It is about a roman general who was about to become emporer when the emperor's son killed the emperor and attempts to kill Russel Crowe(The roman general Maximus) Maximus then becomes enslaved after his family is crusified. He becomes a gladiator for his owner Proximus and earns his way to the Collesium by defeating everone in his path. I won't tell you the rest. The movie has a good plot and keeps you on your toes. The battle scenes are great and so are the backstabbing liars in this movie. The battle scenes are also very gory and bloddy. Many people have their heads cut off and you can see their heads laying on the ground. So its a bit gross for your kids. The one thing I did not care for was some of the actors. I believe that some actors could have done a better part. Russel, old Caesar, and the slaves do well acting but some other actors do not. I watched this movie on VHS and its sound and picture was ok. Although watching this on DVD would be a lot better. This is another reason I rated it four stars. It was hard to hear and understand some conversations. All-in-all I would reccomend that you go and rent the movie first and than buy it because with this movie, you either hated it or you loved it. There was no middle.	4.0	Gory	2001-04-29	0	0	0

From the beginning I knew it wasn't like anything I had seen in a long time. Russell Crowe was just...superb in this very different role. Joaquin Phoenix was a great image of an evil character, although there were motives behind his behavior that made you feel just a little sorry for him. &quot;Gladiator&quot; made my eyes water not much with sadness, but at the beauty of this remarkable storyline of strength, honor, betrayal, and the fall of both the hero as well as the villain. I don't know how long they took to make a movie like this, but it doesn't look like the typical &quot;eye candy&quot; that was put together by computers in two days. This one's a keeper and a treasure in anyone's movie collection. This is clearly the best film Ridley Scott has ever directed, and I think in his heart, he knows this. Watch this one without expecting it to totally change your life, and you will see the reason for most of the good reviews.	5.0	ASTOUNDING!	2000-09-25	3	2	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3ONKRWEZMJJUV	"Adrian Duran Sanchez ""Conductista"""	Written in the classical fashion of the Hero's quest (the old way of Hero stories, for whom their fall from grace is the journey to revenge and redemption), Gladiator brings back the charm and violence of the so called Roman Empire, with its self indulgent blood thirst, and thankfully away from all the Christian topics (commonly surrounding the genre back in the old days), it is about the thrive for power and payback for the sins of thy beloved, even if it is your brother or sister, revenge conveys into the motif to kill for the masses, the most popular events in the Empire, played all over the realm, lasting for long centuries. The ones about to die salute, there for when applauding, you give then back their dignity and will to overcome the other Gladiator, the crowd decides their pardon or kill, and so the Arena is brought back to satisfied the need for such an entertainment, the mother of all blood sports, and the mob's red torn ideal of entertainment, Hail Caesar!Gladiator was intended to be only an appealing summer movie for audiences all around the world, but it ended being much more. Honored with 5 Academy Awards (Including Best Picture), the film revive a genre that had been forgotten for more than two decades, and almost 40 years after the last gladiator movie (Spartacus, 1960), intrigue political, and huge action spectacle are again the Odeum of Dark Blood and deceive, towards the Emperor's son, to overcome the uncanny mighty thirst of manipulative will over the people, to be their father, and consume the sister's love, twisted and rising over an splendorous dry atmosphere of dust and red water.Wisely choreographed, and visually breathtaking, Gladiator uses the camera and sound maximum to blend the action / adventure angle around factual characters (Marcus Arurelius and his son Commodus), but away from their factual life realities, Maximus is the favorite Son, and Commodus the unmoral blood, where the story is to much alike, or to much a coincidence with its predecessor, The Fall of the Roman Empire; Stolen or Homage?Ever since Blade Runner, Ridley Scott hasn't been able to rise the directorial quality that made him initially a young promise in the film industry, with Gladiator he came close (not matching the excellence level of his first 3 films, Gladiator is his best movie since Thelma and Louise), Scott's direction is elegant and visually rich, along with a pace that allows the story develops without any hesitation, the result values by own merits, from Germania to Rome it self, the landscapes are enhanced and enlightened by a magnificent photography that brings all the beauty of the surroundings, (Gladiator loss Best Photography against Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). The amazing visually effects made possible the breathtaking grandeur of Rome, specially in its beating hard, the Coliseum, shown as it had never been seen before, the 360 degrees shot of the Gladiators entering the Arena is the visual climax of the film. Massive fights against barbarians, or strategy to survive the recreation of the battle of Cartage, the choreography stands approaching with realism and sense. Russell Crowe brings freshness to the all to used classic Hero (who's unbreakable in his believes of moral and honor), wining the Academy Award for Best Actor (even though Crowe's performance is excellent, his character was the most simple of the nominees, there for, he didn't deserved the praise). The supporting cast shines also, Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus, also brings something fresh to the also all to used pusillanimous villain. A short appearance by the late Richard Harris (one of his last films), in the indispensable Marcus Aurelius role, gives elegance to the cast, the also late Oliver Reed, brings sharpness to his last role: Proximo. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla does an O.K. job.Gladiator posses one of very best music scores made in the last 30 years, composed by the great Hans Zimmer and the legendary Lisa Gerrard, the score is an absolute masterpiece, fresh, strong, solid, and complicated, (unfortunately, Gladiator's score loss the Academy Award against Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, an score that is nothing more than nice).The DVD edition comes in a great transferring, widescreen edition with DTS 5.1 surround sound, and the excellent DTS ES 6.1 surround sound. The extras are worthy of watching them several times (I love the Trailers), specially the great documentary made for this DVD, Gladiators; Roman Blood Sport, gives more data and insight about this fighting class. A whole combo is what this version is.Maybe not the best film of 2000, Gladiator is a great visual experience, certainly one of the best films of its year, and a great come back for the genre.	4.0	Infamia, to thrive for Centuries.	2003-10-29	0	0	0

It looks the worst in the action sequences, and the best in the close-ups when the actors face the camera and try to cry as intensely as possible to win their oscars.To me, it never looked worse than a dvd. It always looked better. And the flawed transfer never stopped me from enjoying the story. I haven't seen the movie for several years.

But I can respect the people who care enough complain and boycott just for the principal of the thing.If you want to watch Gladiator on blu-ray, you can rent it 20 times for the cost of owning it.Braveheart, on the other hand, is absolutely one of the best blu-rays I've ever seen, and worth collecting if you're a collector or cinematic awesomeness."	4.0	Blu-ray Is Worth Renting, Not Owning	2009-09-13	8	4	4

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A23V875B0Q9HT7	Agustin Guerrero	Great entertainment but hollow.  There are so many holes and so many details that are wrong in this movie that detracts a lot from a great performance from Russel Crowe that is about the only thing worth saving in this movie.  I want to be entertained but also want to learn something in the process and dislike very much when historical details in big budget movies are not taken into account.First the story was a remake of Fall of the Roman Empire which was a movie from the sixties, I believe that movie is better done than the more modern Gladiator.The quirks:  first is highly doubtful that the Second in Command of the Roman Empire will fall all the way to gladiator in the social ladder no matter the circumstances.  Great leaders as Maximus is depicted to be have partisans, friends, bankers, Senators and military men in their camp, these men will never allow their leader the shame of being sold as a slave.  Even if Maximus kept his identity in hiding the minute it was known it would have generated such an uproar in Roman Society (which was very conservative and class concious) that the Emperor would have to liberate the great man on the spot.Commodus was badly depicted, Roman annals usually depict him as a Hercules not as a wimp, he indeed fought in the arena as a gladiator to the astonishment and censure of the Roman Society and he indeed died in a coup but he didn't die in the arena as depicted in the movie but was assasinated by his mistress ( a gladiatrix and part of a well planned coup de etat) in his palace.  Marcus Aurelius was indeed a philosopher and a man of reason but never tried to return the Roman Empire to the control of the Senate, he nominated Commodus as his heir and there is no mention in any historical record of a General of the Northern Legions that achieved an status of rival heir to the empire to Commodus.  This is great historic license in a time where historical records abound.The gladiators were not paired as the movie depicts and did not use the equipment depicted in the movie.  There was a strict pairing of gladiator classes for example the Retiarius (net and trident) always fought the Secutor (short sword, shield, closed helmet); the Samnite (equiped as almost a roman legionnaire) fought the Tracian (heavy shield, short sword, hevily protected).  The contest was usually ability and speed against superior weapons. The movie shows gladiators not having a class system, and the equipment depicted looks more like 10th century sarracen helmets and other anachronistic weapons.  Since gladiators cost much to train and feed they were a huge investment for the owners making the fights to the death a rare ocurrence and not a norm such as the movie shows.The battle in Germania shows some interesting details and I like the way the soldiers are portrayed and the heavy use of artillery which is the first time I see in the recreation of a Hollywood Roman battle, but then they mar the effect by showing an infantry charge in testudo formation which was not used for open battle but only to breach a fortified position.  The Roman infantry relied on movility and their highly skilled use of weapons , first they approached the battle field at a convenient distance started the deluge of pilum as the legionnaires carried two javelins a light thrown at grater distance and a heavy thrown nearer to the enemy.  The purpose of this evolution is disabling the first rank of the enemy by killing, maiming or disaibling the shields and creating breaches in the enemy formation to be exploited in the subsequent charge.  After throwing the pilum javelins, the roman legion charged into the enemy at a run attacking with the gladius short stabbing swords, they did not use slashing techniques as portrayed in the movie but tried to stab the enemy at close quarters.  The battle as shown in the movie was badly choreagraphed and the romans did not use the advantage of superior training but thay engage in a mele&eacute;.  The cavalry charge was probably well portrayed.Again we had the possibility of getting a great movie but some directorial decisions especially concerning the details made it a rather mediocre production.  This is hard to understand as there are many historians and consultants that could have been used to get the historical details right.	3.0	Another Great Movie Ruined by Details	2008-06-23	6	2	4
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1DTCJV6KOMJOA	A*	Gladiator has to be the best sandal and sword epic ever made! To be serious it doesn't have a single drop of camp in it! Unlike Ben-Hur or Spartacus-even though Gladiator is a send up of those past Hollywood mega productions the main difference is Russell Crowe his raw energy and stocky apperance lend a natural flow to the believability of the film. The dialouge will soon go down in pop culture history Just listen to any ranting speech that Joaquin Phoneix's character gives in the film. The direction by Scott is breathtaking i have never been a fan of his due to the fact in almost all Scott's movies outside of Thelma and Louise all the characters seem under developed and the main attraction is the violence but here there is a brilliant balance! Scott still treats the fight scenes as cold and haarsh as ever giving them a rev of heart pulsing urgency! But thanks to great acting by the ENTIRE cast never once is the fighting or personal strife unnatural. The cinematography is also great. Alot of critics dismiss Gladiator as summer fluff but it's more than that for all of the above mentioned reason and one that every critic wants to forget- IT WON BEST PICTURE AT THIS YEARS ACADEMY AWARDS!!

Unfortunately Gladiator does not quite reach that level. The plot is not strong enough and personnaly I found the use of computergravics to generate a crowd, or even a sky a bit annoying at times. This said, the movie fulfills it's most important task: It is entertaining. There is a lot of action, which looks good, (although again, the scene with the tigers features to much CGI at times) the acting is okay, with a splendid last performance by Oliver Reed and the costumes are a feast for the eyes.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A24YME33WJ71LY	AJ Starling	"Where to start?  This one comes out of the gate swinging.  If you thought the archers' scene in ""Robin Hood Prince of Theives"" was a good one, you'll love how this movie opens up although it's a couple of shades darker.  From there it gets interesting on a drama level, although the action only subsides for a few minutes.The heart of this movie is the jouney of a man named Maximus - a Roman General betrayed by a young (and quite mad) emperor and captured as a slave after being wounded.  As a slave he is forced to fight for his survival in the games.  As he did in his previous life, Maximus becomes a leader.  As a leader, but still a slave, Maximus now threatens the emperor who as time wears on threatens to destroy Rome from the inside with is growing madness.The acting performances are absolutely superb, as is the story.  I had never seen Joaquin Phoenix before in anything, but his asking price should have doubled or better after this film.  Although Russell Crowe's performance is also exemplory, it was Joaquin playing the part of a man on the edge that had me glued to the screen, but I'm partial to really bad guys when they're played well and the screenwriters did an excellent job of making Commodus a man to be feared by interplaying what you see coming with what you don't.  Richard Harris' brief role is also a memorable performance.The cinematagraphy is splendid as is Hans Zimmer's musical score.The movie is long, but worth sitting through.An important point here is that this movie involves a lot of blood, death, and strictly adult themes.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A21WD6EN5YMFD0	Alan Jeffries	Gladiator is one of those movies that doesn't just stun and amaze you, but adds something significant to its genre.  In Gladiator's case, it's in the action scenes.  Most action movies try to slow down the action (Braveheart, The 13th Warrior, etc.) for at least some of the battle scenes.  Not Gladiator.  Oh no.  Gladiator does the opposite.  Along with some camera techniques that I can't begin to describe, this makes for possibly the most visceral and engaging action sequences since, well, Seven Samurai.  As for the story, it is surprisingly well done, and while many discredit the movie for its &quot;historical inaccuracy,&quot; it is sure a whole lot more historically accurate than say, The Patriot.  Actors are generally strong from the indomitable, electrifying Crowe to the loasthome yet, admittedly, effective Phoenix.  A broad range of realistic characters is well represented here.  The musical score is stirring, ominous, and, when necessary, complements the action very nicely.  At over two and a half hours, this is one movie that really takes advantage of its length (seven battles makes for a long movie and a whole lot of head-lopping).  Not for the faint of heart.  Certainly for just about anyone else.  Definitely for those who have been starved for some really engaging swords-and-axes-and-arrows combat.But why am I wasting my time writing this?

Instead Commodus cheats and kills our hero.  After watching it a second time, however, it became my favorite movie of all time and that still holds true today almost 10 years removed.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1LBMDHBZJGJ44	Alberto Diaz	"What can I say, this is the best movie I have ever seen, when I saw the trailer on t.v I knew it was going to be a box-office hit at least, but when I saw the movie, just for the first scene, the Battle, I knew this was the best movie of the year and the best movie yet. I saw it on the premiere and not many people believed my comments, but afterwards most of my relatives and friends agreed with me, this is a G R E A T movie, for years we had been expecting, or at least I had been expecting a great movie, and after the Titanic disappointment, I though it would never come, but oh boy Ridley Scott did a terrific job in accomplishing this, making a both emotional and exiting and visually alluring film, then he went on an made another amazing movie, Hannibal, not as great, but sure a great movie to spend 2 hours and 20 minutes of your time watching Anthony Hopkins do what he does best, be Hannibal ""the cannibal"" Lecter. But lets talk Gladiator, Russell Crowe is great, no wander he won the Oscar for his performance, I would have lost all my respect to the award if he didn't. Joaquin Phoenix should and I still complain about it, won the Oscar, sure, Benicio was good, but if you see Phoenix and compare it to Benicio you will see my point, the role of Commodus was much more emotional, had more screen time, the character for me was better and I think played greatly. The rest of the cast is also wonderful, specially the late Oliver Reed, too bad we lost this great actor, he may had won the Oscar for this performance. And the soundtrack is another proof that Hans Zimmer is a genius. To sum up, buy Gladiator, is a great movie, and a great DVD, it has great sound, picture, and special features, a must have. 5 stars are not enough."	5.0	BEST MOVIE EVER, THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY	2001-12-19	2	1	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2EOFYRFB292KS	"Alberto M. Barral ""NY LuxViewer"""	This movie is a great action movie of the toga-sandal genre, it is NOT a historical movie, though it is set in Ancient Rome.The true history of Commodus is much more exciting, imaginative and colorful than the trite story line we are given in this film.Here are the most important facts on which the movie differs from history:1-Commodus was never disowned by his father, on the contrary from a very young age Marcus Aurelius wanted him to be his heir and gave him all the necessary titles and honors to go along with the job. All evidence points to exactly the opposite, he loved his son too much rather than too little. It is hard to believe such an intelligent man picked such a poor successor since at 19, which was his age at his father's death,  (and roughly our equivalent of 30) Commodus must have demonstrated his character faults plenty of times. He was co-ruler with his father from 176 onwards and his father died in 180. He did not have to kill him to become the ruler as he already was.2-Commodus had a sister Lucilla, ( he also had several others, none of which appear in the film) who had been married to Lucius Verus, co-ruler with his father, when he started his reign, and therefore had the title since then of 'Augusta'. She conspired against him in 182, according to the sources the cause was friction with the Empress Crispina, Commodus' wife. This was just two years after he became sole emperor, with two of her lovers, Marcus Ummidius Quadratus (the consul of 167, who was also her first cousin) and Appius Claudius Quintianus, both were executed, she was exiled to Capri and then conveniently murdered. She was married at the time but her husband was not implicated in the conspiracy.This is a much better script than the movie's and I can not comprehend why it was not used instead of the convoluted absurd scenario that was concocted.Furthermore this Lucilla looks like she just graduated from Vassar. When will American audiences comprehend that the Romans were overwhelmely dark-haired and that only the Barbarians at that time were fair?? Such a persistent racist perspective, which is present since the beginning of Hollywood by British actors playing the roles of Romans, is really incomprehensible today, particularly in the case of Lucilla's child that looks ready for kindergarten in Switzerland or the senators we see, all of which could be having a drink at the Harvard Club and none of which could have possibly been a Roman aristocrat.3-Commodus did fight both animals and gladiators in public, however he did not die in the arena, but was strangled by his professional trainer, the wrestler Narcissus, who conspired with Commodus mistress, Marcia to get into his bedroom and strangle him after Marcia had made Commodus drunk. There are discrepancies in the sources as to whether it happened in the bathroom or the bed, either one of which would have been better than the silly circus fight that we knew before he started it he was going to 'lose'.4-Maximus as a character did not exist at that period, it is a complete fabrication with a little bit of Spartacus, Richard Burton's Anthony and a lot of Steve Reeve's Hercules thrown in a blender.5-The emperor Commodus was heavily muscled and bearded and considered a model of male beauty at that time. Numerous statues show him in Hercules' regalia.  Joaquin Phoenix is terribly miscast in the role, he looks like a Roman bureaucrat, at best, and at worst like just a jackass. His costumes are particularly wrong, much more suited for the Opera stage of Venice during the 18th Century. His makeup would have been great in a silent film and is strangely out of place here, verging on the comical.6-The depiction of the gladiators, like all American productions relating to this period of history completely and purposefully distorts the facts of their daily life and exercise by censoring, hiding and refusing to allocate nudity and the strong presence of sexuality, both heterosexual and homoerotic that was part of that world. When will we see that our present day ideas on the topic had NOTHING to do with the way these people lived?? What we see here is a varsity team that can kill in the field, not the super stars of the Roman arena that had huge fame and wealth along with all the perks that came with their violent, brutal profession.All of the above taken into consideration, the movie is an entertaining, fast-action fantasy that has escapist value. Russell Crowe never looked better and he does do an extremely convincing characterization of a provincial, country-loving, old fashioned virtuous and somewhat brutish Roman general of the type the Romans themselves always liked to praise with great respect.	3.0	Compare the Facts with this Fiction: History had a MUCH better script...	2009-08-12	15	2	13
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ASC5CH6RALOHL	"Alden Utter ""nedlum"""	The other reviews on this site list all of the admirable qualities of Gladiator. However, there is something that needs to be adressed. It's a good movie, but it has one flaw: its deadpan seriousness.Gladiator pays homage to Spartacus, Ben-Hur: epics of Ancient Rome. However, it ignores that the other films aren't all serious. The tone of the other films has some lighthearted parts. However, this film just won't let up on the gloom.I can apreicate that Maximus (Crowe) has lost everything he had, and so isn't inclined to be happy. But director Ridley Scott seems to think that this means the entire film should be sad. Humor and drama, as a rule, help each other thrive.There are, to be fair, some lighter notes: two times the viewer chuckles. However, two is hardly enough: Hamlet, a dark play by any standards, has some great laughs of all stripes.Gladiator is a good movie; it has a properly epic feel at times, and is quite stirring at times. But the overly depressing feel that covers the film keeps it from acheiving greatness.	4.0	Good film, but joyless	2002-10-20	3	2	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A20LY8E9NGYA4M	Alejandro Cortes	"Ridley Scott, who directed ""Gladiator"", took some of the best elements in classic movies like ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" (the set designs, the big production values, the man-to-man combats, the huge number of extras), and combined them with modern elements inspired by movies like ""Braveheart"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (the digital effects, the realism of the battles, the man fighting for his country and seeking for revenge).""Gladiator"" is a modern epic with good performances and good direction work. The cast includes solid actors like Russell Crowe, who dominates his role, specially in the physical aspect where he really looks like a warrior. Richard Harris in a brief but essential role as Marcus Aurelius. Joaquin Phoenix as the infamous Commodus, he portrayed one of the most cynic villains in recent years. Oliver Reed as Proximo, he also gave a memorable performance.Ridley Scott gave a dynamic pace to ""Gladiator"", even though this movie is an epic, its length is shorter than movies like ""Ben-Hur"". He also used CGI visual effects in a lot of open camera angles, for example, in the landscapes there are a lot of CGI elements added to the shots. The sound and the music are very good, and it reflects in a more realistic movie.""Gladiator"" is a very good movie, it's a very good way to introduce younger audiences to a classic genre.

It's an archetypal story of one man destroying an empire, similar to Braveheart.  The uniqueness of the story comes with the Roman setting which is breathtaking and realistic.  Russell Crowe leads a wonderful cast, including Joaquim Phoenix as his nemesis.  The performances are strong, the plot is good, and the action is intense. The DVD serves the movie very well, with sharp picture and awesome sound that can shake the whole house.  The extras are awesome including Discovery Channel documentaries on Gladiator, interviews, and cutscenes.

It showed the strength of the human spirit and a man with a good soul will be able to be at peace with himself in the end of the day as Maximus was when he was dying.  The only criticism people have of this film was that was not historically accurate.  I am not one of those cinema fans who expect movies to be exactly accurate.  My God it is an entertaing movie and with a great plot.  If you want to know about the history of Rome for historical accuracy read a book.

My copy is without the Yellow UPC, and without the 2-DISC label above the PARAMOUNT logo on the back of the slip cover. But it also came with the expired $10 Discount Offer on the front of the slip cover. I was contemplating whether to return it, but decided to give it a spin!Turn out that IT IS the Remastered copy! Skin tone appear natural with good detail, especially Cassius robe and all the armors! None of the airbrush/plastic face as mentioned for the previous disc. The theatrical and extended scenes look identical in detail and color, can't really tell the different.So don't get despair when you receive one without the Yellow UPC (and the expired $10 Discount label)! If it didn't have the 2-DISC label above the PARAMOUNT loge ON THE BACK OF THE SLIP COVER, give it a spin for a physical check! It just might turn out to be the Remastered copy!Anyway, there are already report that AMAZON is shipping those with Yellow UPC! One should be fine to order now.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2SHF3F8N7HGS3	"Allen Eaton ""aleaton3"""	"When asked, the screenwriter of GLADIATOR says he was unaware of an ealier film, THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (1964), although both stories are book-ended the same.  To the story-tellers of both films, it was apparently not important to reveal that Emperor Marcus Aurelius actually wanted his only surviving son, Commodus, to take the throne (thereby breaking the tradition of picking and adopting the best man to rule the Empire).  Also, Commodus reuled 11 years (from 180 to 191ce), although GLAIDATOR gives the impression that it was closer to 5.  Commodus' sister telles Maximus in the beginning that she has a son nearly 8 years old; later, her son meets Maximus in Rome, shortly before Commodus' death.  In reality, this child should be a man of 19, although he is depicted as closer to 13.  In the end, however, what bothers me most about GLADIATOR's script is that the tale is unfinished.  It begins in a specific year (180), and gives extensive details of the northern campaign, plus the Emperor's imagined death.  It then gives pages and pages of discussions on ""what is Rome?"" and how can the ""idea that is Rome"" be saved from the curelty of the Emperors?  Will Rome remain an Empire or revert back to a Republic?  A senator (Derek Jacobi) is introduced to show that the Senate is against Commodus.  This Sentator is finally jailed for treason and then freed - but to what end?  With Commodus dead, and Maximus dead, where is the rest of the story?  What happens next?  What happens to the senator, Commodus' sister or, especially, her son, the supposed heir to the throne?  He's old enough to succeed (historically, that is).  Does he take the throne or not?  Who is the next Emperor?  At least the 1964 film (with the most rediculous ending in Hollywood history) answers that question, with the throne being offered to the highest bidder among Rome's millionaires.  The DVD presents the film in a lovely picture and sound transfer.  Ridley Scott's film is beautifully mounted, and took enormous pains to present equisite details of ancient Roman life.  The acting by Crowe and Reed is especially outstanding.  But without a proper ending, in my opinion, the movie fails to satisfy a certain emotion need."	3.0	Hollywood vs. History	2003-09-13	1	1	0

But ""Gladiator"" bowled me over twice--once in the theater and once again at home courtesy of the two-disc DVD. (In fact, I consider that DVD such a staple that I'll probably screen it every year or so for years to come.)As you probably know, the plot takes an outstanding Roman general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), from the site of his greatest military victory, and made him persona non grata the minute the old emperor died and the new one, his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) took over under dubious circumstances. Maximus was scheduled for execution by the insecure new emperor but escaped and headed for his villa in Spain, but it was too late--Roman troops had already crucified and burned his wife and child. Maximus suffered a nervous collapse and was sold into slavery.As portrayed by the powerful and versatile actor Russell Crowe, the plotwork of Maximus' struggle out of that and into ""top billing"" as a gladiator in Rome's Coliseum is best left to the movie; but as I alluded to before, even a short-attention-span guy like me found this meaty film downright riveting. Not to be ignored is the role of dialog and character development that intelligently and even gracefully motivates the plot. In a sense, this is the kind of epic 20th-Century Fox tried to make in 1962 with Cleopatra but generally flopped; happily, ""Gladiator"" deserves its already iconic status. It has everything--an epic scope, taut plotting, and performances worthy of the dialog: alongside Crowe, featured actors include the late Oliver Reed, the ever-so-slithery Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus, and wonderful Derek Jacobi as the elderly Senator who views his nutso new emperor with the detachment of a patrician and the fear of someone worried about the common people's welfare.Thanks to computer animation and lots of graphic design, we are put in the middle of a quite realistic 50,000-seat Coliseum. (The ""bells and whistles"" special-feature aspect of the DVD package include a fine documentary of the making of the film, and intelligently discusses how computer-generated imagery [""CGI""] played such a foundational role in it.)Oh, yes, the blood-and-guts factor at those games? The spectacles are fast, violent, bloody and (despite my every effort) intensely absorbing. And needless to say the scene when Maximus confronts Commodus, who had given him up for dead, is remarkable. your-pal-al allen smalling /This is just one wonderful flick!"	5.0	It Is, Too, Available, Dear 'Zon--At least the two-discer...	2004-09-20	1	1	0

If anyone has a DVD player, they can give it to me if they want.)First of all, this movie is pretty gory.  Most of it happens so quick that you won't have time to look away, though, so it's not that hard to take.  But make sure you tell the kiddies to go play with their barbies or something.  This will scare the wee ones out of their wits.  They'll cry to you hours into the night, you won't get ANY sleep. and your day will be lousier.The best part of the movie is how it truly captures the terror of being a gladiator.  That must've been a horrible job.  But those are also the most gory parts, so be warned.I though the movie overall was a good experience.  I was satisfied when it ended, but I wasn't all that emotionally touched.  Just satisfied, basically.  Also, the movie is sort of long, which I felt it was just so it could say it was &quot;an epic.&quot; I feel it could've been shortened down a tad bit (maybe take out the subplot about the incestous relationship between Caesar and his sis).	3.0	Good, but not great	2001-02-02	3	1	2

In the meantime,Commodus has killed his father Marcus Aurelius (the late Richard Harris) and lusts after his sister (Connie Nielsen) The characters fit general stereotypes:the Evil Emperor,the Noble Gladiator,Suffering Sister,but at least Phoenix and Crowe imbue their characters with some depth.Connie Nielsen stars as Maximus' royal ex-girlfriend. She tries to comfort the grieving widower,but he refuses her. Nevertheless,she agrees to help him. In the end,Maximus defeats Commodus and in the process he himself dies.""Gladiator"" isn't exactly deep (if you want a deep Ridley Scott movie,get ""Blade Runner"" instead)but it is good sword and sandal fun. It also has a good message about defending family and freedom. Russell Crowe is sexy as the lead,worthy muscular eye candy.

Edges look enhanced and fine details get blurred over throughout, all of which takes away from the viewing experience.

I hope its a turningpoint in Ridley Scotts career. He was one of the finest directors (Alien, Blade Runner, Legend) and i hope he will be again after his more recent works (White Squall, G.I Jane).  I can't remember one thing that i didn't liked in Gladiator, so i only mention the most important in my opinion. The cinematography is wonderful, ranging from harsh to poetic. The acting is without any minor failure, and the Soundtrack is one of the alltime best i've heard.This movie is well deserved one to add to my &quot;Best Ever List&quot;, along with Blade Runner and My Neighbor Totoro.So go and see it and if you don't like it, believe me it's not the fault of the movie (again in my opinion).	5.0	The Best in years	2000-12-07	3	3	0

It's down right offensive to anyone who knows anything at all about the Roman Empire. The costumes (which won an Oscar!) are even worse (note that the emperor's sister is wearing a Victorian corset, complete with busk, over a sari in one scene!). It's criminal that Hollywood gets away with such travesties, and is rewarded with praise and adulation for them, especially when these so called ""historical"" movies end up in our children's classrooms as study aids. Why can't the entertainment industry spend the extra five minutes to check their history, or hire a consultant? The ONLY reason to see this film is if you're a die-hard Russell Crowe fan (and even then in falls into the same group as the quick and the dead: Watch the Russell scenes, and fast forward through the rest)."	1.0	bad history. bad costumes. just plain bad.	2001-11-09	14	4	10

It is so loaded with extras that it has a second disk for the special features.  It is loaded with trailers, 11 scenes cut from the movie, interviews with Ridley Scott and Hans Zimmer, behind the scenes features, and much much more.  The DVD is way above average when it comes to features.  It is also equipped with Dolby Digital sound that can turn any home entertainment system into your personal movie theater.The movie is great!  Russell Crowe gives a stellar performance.  The movie is action packed and full of graphic fighting scenes.  It's funny to see some of the trailers on the DVD, because they try to make this movie out to be some kind of sappy love story.  This movie is about love, but the love that the trailers are refering to.  The love in this movie is Maximus' love for the old emporer and for his family.  It isn't sappy at all.  The violence in the movie is extremely graphic, but the story line is terrific and it is wonderfully done with terrific acting and a great musical score by Hans Zimmer.  If you don't have this DVD, I highly recommend you get it.  It is well worth the money.	5.0	Great Film!!  Fully Loaded DVD!!	2000-12-17	0	0	0

Made in the style of Cecile B DeMille type sweeping saga's it IS a very good movie, with a great script and wonderful performances all round, especially from Oliver Reed, in this his last movie. However, it seems to have fallen foul of it's own misconceptions that films of this genre need to be long to be artistic. Truthfully, the running time could have been shaved by about 30 minutes, and little would have been lost in entertainment value. Russell Crowe's performance is both powerful and believable,  and the camera work is both stunning and inventive. This is a good movie, but one can't help feeling that many viewers will find it somewhat protracted and a tad on the long side.	4.0	Stunning	2000-11-20	0	0	0

How a lot of reviewers saw this before it was released, I'd like to know.  I would, because that's a nice connection!  I took advantage of Bestbuy's deal for Gladiator and Braveheart, but before I opened my copy, I rented it, just to be safe.  After all the negative reviews, I was looking for every flaw mentioned, and I did not really see what other reviewers saw.  If anything, the better technology is, the more it exposes flaws.  You can really see how made-up some of these stars are.  Maybe a lot of what people are complaining about just was not apparent until you see it on Blu-ray.  Could they have done better?  Always possible.  There was definately nothing to complain about here. Only a few scenes in the movie were really a couple of minutes long, and maybe then could I tell a slight difference.  I was also looking for things because of all the negative reviews, which kind of isn't fair.  I gave this movie 4 insted of 5 stars because sometime the faces did look a tad artificial, but with the constant back-and-forth between light and dark, who's really to say except Ridely Scott, what it should look like.  Definate step up from the dvd, although the DTS es audio was actually louder at a lower volume.  The picture was definately not as sharp on the dvd.  If they can make this picture better, I'd sure like to see it.  As always, see it with your own eyes and decide for yourself.	4.0	People are way too picky.	2009-09-04	27	12	15

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	Anyone who knows me knows my unwavering devotion to this film.  In fact it was this film that introduced me to the man I now consider a god among men so it will always hold a special place in my heart.  That aside though I can honestly say that `Gladiator' is a masterpiece of a film, from start to finish, utterly amazing to witness.  It is far from your generic action fair for it manages to embody the audience with emotions which for the most part find themselves nonexistent in films of this nature.  This of course is a result of the iconic performance by Russell Crowe who breathes so much life and realism into Maximus.  When Maximus falls to his knees to kiss the burnt feet of his beloved wife and child my body was flushed with chills for I felt his pain, his sorrow and his fear.  I think it's safe to say that Russell Crowe earned that Oscar fair and square.I've always been drawn to epics of this nature.  The swords and sandals type war films have always intrigued me and I can honestly say that I have yet to see one that reaches the grandeur that is `Gladiator'.  `Gladiator' tells the story of Maximus Decimus Meridius, one time general to the Roman army, as he battles in the gladiatorial arenas just waiting for his chance at revenge.  Maximus' life was going well for a time.  He was leading the army to victory (as is seen in the opening battle sequence), earning the respect of Emperor Marcus Aurelius and in effect earning the right to return home to his wife and son.  Before he can return home though he is given a privileged assignment by the Emperor, an assignment that ultimately causes Aurelius' son Commodus to kill his father and order Maximus' execution.  Not just that but he goes as far as to order the murder of Maximus' wife and son leaving him with nothing.  Maximus of course escapes his own death only to uncover the extent that Commodus has gone.  With a broken spirit and a wounded soul Maximus collapses in the desert only to wake up a slave being trained for the coliseum.  When Maximus hears that Commodus is holding a gladiatorial event in the honor of his late father he sees this as his golden opportunity for revenge.What Ridley Scott has done here is create for us a beautiful and intoxicating story of love, betrayal, devotion and revenge.  As `Gladiator' unfolds we watch the story of a man and his plight, his determination fueling our interest.  We become invested in this man and his relationships.  We develop our own loathing for Commodus (thanks in part to Joaquin Phoenix's fantastic performance) as well as our deepest sympathies for his beautiful sister Lucilla.  Lucilla becomes an emotional catalyst for the film in areas being almost the only mediator between Maximus and Commodus, as well as the members of the Senate against Commodus' rule.  Lucilla once loved Maximus herself but now she needs his help more than ever to help carry out her fathers wishes of handing power over to the Senate.  Lucilla has a lot at stake though.  Not only is she risking her own life by deceiving the Emperor but she risks the life of her young son Lucius who's taken a liking to the gladiator known as Maximus.  Lucilla also has to detour her brothers sickening advances towards her in hopes of spawning a perfect heir.Russell Crowe delivers one of the most powerfully moving performances of his career (I'm still sticking by his `Insider' work as his finest) and definitely turns out the most impressive performance of the given year.  As Maximus he delves deep into his character (doesn't he always) and gives the audience a reason to watch.  Joaquin Phoenix also delivers a spot on portrayal of the evil Commodus.  He perfectly captures the immaturity within Commodus' every move and that lies behind every motivation.  Connie Nielsen is wonderfully reserved as Lucilla.  With her restrained performance we can see the underlying emotion within her each and every step.  The supporting players also deliver on all fronts.  Oliver Reed is hilariously entertaining as Proximo and Richard Harris is effective as the dying Marcus Aurelius, but it's Djimon Hounsou who really shines here.  With his moving portrayal of Juba, a fellow gladiator, he brings to us a glimmer of hope amidst the doomed affair.  It's no wonder this man is a two time Oscar nominee already.As wonderfully effective as the cast truly is there is no star like the amazing cinematography.  With each and every passing of the camera lens the screen illuminates with detail unlike any other.  The Italian country side is gorgeously captured, the Roman Coliseum (as digitally remastered as it is) is fantastically accurate and the set designs are breathtaking to say the least.  What I found amazing was that each and every actor looked dignified and authentic, which is hard to do when you're running around in togas and fighting in sandals.  Nothing looks cheesy but everything looks as it should and carries the feeling of weighty authority that it deserves.I'm sure there are plenty of individuals who will find fault with this film but this is one of the only times where I wholeheartedly agree with the Academy in their choice of best film of the year.  `Gladiator' is, in my humble opinion, the best film to be released in 2000, and in some areas the best film to be released in the past decade.  It's one of, if not my favorite film of all time, but even I will admit to the biased love that is my undying devotion to Russell Crowe as being the main reason I say that.  Whether or not you worship this film as much as I do I'm sure you at least have to agree that it is, above all else, stunning.	5.0	Powerful and moving, a film that elevates what could have been generic into something nothing short of stunning...	2007-10-21	3	1	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1R90KXMPXCAP	Andrew	Really, I don't understand its appeal. Its plot is moronic: in case you didn't know, the emperor names a general (Russell Crow) as his sucessor. But then, suprise, the emperor's son takes the throne anyway. If this wasn't foolish enough, the general is then sent to be killed, but instead manages to escape, and then becomes a gladiator. I won't say the rest because I don't want to spoil it (not that there's much to spoil.) But really, based on the plot alone this movie didn't deserve &quot;Best Picture.&quot; Next there's the cardboard cut-out characters and mediocre acting.I guess this movie is ok as far as action is concerned, but I've seen much better action direction and special effects than this movie has to offer. The decent action scenes are the reason this thing got 2 stars.Anyway, if you're looking for plot, Spartacus would be a better choice. And if you're looking for action, Saving Private Ryan (although calling that movie an action movie isn't totally accurate) or The Matrix, would be wise choices.

Compare the screenshots on the AVS Forum post:bit.ly/EkTmM (Amazon seems to screen out external links in reviews, so just copy and paste this into the address bar)Especially shocking to me (in terms of parts of the images being erased) are images 3 and 7. If you compare one of the broadcast HDTV versions with the Blu-ray version, you'll see that in image 3 (with the ""Germania"" caption) part of the spear on the left-hand side has been erased because the image-processing software thought that it should blend in with the tress in the background...Even worse, in image 7, I can count at least 15 flaming arrows that have been removed from the Blu-ray version, presumably because the software thought that they were scratches or imperfections that had to be removed. Also, if you look on the right of the image, part of the fireball has been erased by a blue splodge. You can see what it looks like by downloading the video clips linked from the second post (you'll need a reasonably fast computer to play the 10-second 1080p clips and software such as VLC Media Player from videolan.org).Gladiator is a fantastic movie and one of my favorites, but I would recommend sticking with the DVD until they release a version that doesn't have parts of the images erased."	1.0	Truly shocking when parts of the image are removed	2009-08-28	37	31	6

Everything battle-wise looks old-hat after Kenneth Branaugh's HENRY V and Gibson's BRAVEHEART. GLADIATOR is an enjoyable film with great acting (of course) by Crowe, who carries the film with his singularly massive screen presence.  The supporting cast is good, but on occasion, unremarkable.  I have seen the film three times and remember little about most of the characters.  The locations are great and the script is good if forgettable.  This probably should NOT have won best picture, but you already knew that.  Even so, it remains one of the better films of the year.The DVD is packed and gets a five star rating. I don't know what else could have been added to it. The picture and sound quality are great though not to reference standards.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2S6ATNLVXLWME	Anthony Duca	When I look at a movie based on true, historical events, I look at it from two angles. 1. How accurate the movie is. 2. How enjoyable was it.From an entertainment point of view, this movie was fantastic. It kept we on the edge of my seat, and it offered a wonderful glimpse into the mind set of the Romans during the peak of their empire. The fight scenes were the best of have seen in any movie, and the plot was wonderful.From a historical point of view, this movie drives me nuts. Being a historical buff on the Roman Empire, I can't help it. The historical accuracy of this movie ended with the short blurb of text that appeared on the screen in the beginning of the movie. After that, the movie pretty much disrgarded the actual events, and continued on into a very enjoyable, but largely inaccurate story during the reign of Commodus.Enjoy this movie for what it is, a great story LOOSELY based on history.	5.0	Great flick	2001-05-04	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AK6UVFSU07NXH	Anthony Hinde	For a complex film, &quot;Gladiator&quot; can still be taken for a simple heroic story. Russell Crowe manages to dominate the screen so well that I spent much of my first viewing anticipating his next appearance in the script. It is the sort of film that needs to be seen at least twice  to understand most of the sub-plots. To an extent, this is a flaw on the part of director Ridley Scott. It should have been possible to focus the narrative a little more clearly than he did.The main theme of the film concerns General Maximus Decimus Meridius. The opening scenes show him as a competent, charismatic military leader during a battle where his legions brutally decimate the Germanic hordes. As fine a General as he may be, he is a deliberately poor politician. And so it is no surprise when the prodigal political creature, Cesar's son Commodus, played well be Joaquin Phoenix, takes the throne with the aid of a little poison and immediately sets about to secure his position. Maximus is quietly sent away, to be executed, and orders for his wife and children are on their way before he is out of sight.Not only is Maximus a proficient General but he is also skilled at personal combat. These talents help him to escape his immediate fate but not without some serious wounds. Wounds that slow him enough to prevent any  rescue of his family. And so, we have a classic revenge scenario. The newly crowned Cesar, Commodus, is cast as the villain and Maximus is the hero, bent on revenge. This sort of plot can become laughably predictable but thanks to a decent script and Crowe's outstanding performance, we are forced into the cauldron of hate along with Maximus.His revenge takes a less direct route than Maximus would have liked, since he is quickly scooped up by slave traders and, due to his imposing physique, snapped up by Proximo, a provincial games promoter. Killing for sport suites Maximus well, even if he would prefer a different face on his opponent. It is not long before Proximo realises that he may have something special. Despite the tempering influence of other fighters, specifically the Numidian Juba, (played with subtle appeal by Djimon Hounsou), Maximus is too efficient. He kills without any lingering flourishes, spoiling the crowd's fun.All this changes when Proximo gives Maximus a glimpse of hope. The new  Emperor is reopening the games in Rome and needs Gladiators. Proximo tries to tempt Maximus with the freedom of the wooden sword, a symbol of the freedom awarded for truly spectacular performances in the arena. But freedom is not what fires the General's imagination. It is the fact that the Emperor himself presents the award in person, a clear avenue to consummation of his vengeful goals.Once again the simple linear approach is not taken. Events turn murky as Maximus becomes, at first, a crowd pleaser and then a political power as he successfully and repeatedly defeats the Emperor's chosen on the hot sands of Rome. As his fame spreads, he draws the powerful to him; the Emperor's sister, (and Maximus' former lover), Lucilla, various Senators, and even the Emperor's heir. But in the end it comes down to two, Maximus and Commodus.A lot of people have praised the special effects and cinematography of Gladiator. Personally, I was less than impressed with many of the scenes, as they seemed muddled and confused. Even the computer-generated work forgot the first rule, reality is imperfect. Everything seemed too newly minted; flawless in its grandeur and therefore slightly suspect. However, the action in the coliseum was breathtaking and some of the solo fights were particularly effective cinema. But at bottom, Gladiator is not a special effects movie. It rests squarely on Crowe's shoulders and he successfully carries it beyond the realms of mediocrity, raising it up to become a modern classic.	4.0	Slice and dice with history	2000-10-05	1	0	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1WE6W2Y2M03U4	Antoine Zammit	When it comes to these kind of movies, we can not forget the Epics of the 50s such as 'Ben Hur' and 'Qvo Vadis'. But when a movie is filmed in your  homeland and is all over the press then one must see it.It is a long  movie, so you will need to upgrade to a larger size popcorn for this one.  The storyline has some similarities to the 50's epic 'Ben Hur', but  'Gladiator' leaves 'Ben Hur' to eat dust. The advancement in technology and  special effects are in Gladiator's advantage but so is the casting. We all  remember the artificialness of Charlton Heston's performance but Russell  Crowe is one heck of an actor and he deserves an oscar for his role as  General Maximus.And of course I still have not mentioned that the movie  was filmed in my beloved Malta. Although one must really work hard in  identifying the shots that where filmed in Malta there are quite a few and  the side of the bastions gives it in. And of course the credits give thanks  to 'The Government and People of Malta'.	5.0	Eat dust! Charton Heston	2000-09-19	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2KF9C81HER17Y	A. Phillips	Gladiator, Academy Award Winner for 2000 Best Picture.  The story of a General's fall and rise to Arena champion in his pursuit of vengeance is powered by Russel Crowe's great performance and Ridley Scott's impressive direction.  This 2 Disc set does the film justice.  Another impressive effort from Dreamworks.The video transfer presented in anamorphic widescreen is extremely impressive.  With vibrant colours to the bleak greys and blues of Rome this transfer never ceases to impress.  The opening battle is also complemented by the earthy tones present in the transfer giving the film a gritty and realistic look.The sound on the DVD is extremely impressive.  The Dolby Digital track is very impressive.  The clarity is there and it makes an impressive use of the surrounds.  However the DTS-ES 6.1 Discrete soundtrack is amazing.  I consider it reference quality.  The sound is absolutely amazing.  If you have a DTS capable amplifier don't even bother with the Dolby Digital Track.The extras are not as plentiful as some other DVDs on the market yet they are of very good quality.  The 3 documentaries are very interesting.  There is an extensive deleted scenes section.  As well as plenty of storyboards and trailers and TV Spots.  The Spencer Treat Clark journal is actually quite interesting so give it a read.  Lastly the commentary with Ridley Scott and the Cinematographer and Pietro Scalia is very interesting and entertaining.A film that could be considered an epic has received a very worthy treatment on DVD.	5.0	Strength and Honour - Gladiator on DVD	2001-04-22	3	1	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ARA48345JZPZR	Archmaker	Gladiator is a good movie.  Got that?  A good movie, not a great movie.  Not even an excellent movie.  Just a good movie.  I saw it in the theatre and was disappointed because I was hoping for greatness and something special.  Instead, I got an opening battle that was shot so murkily it was hard to follow the action (it IS much better &amp; clearer on the DVD), and then a story that was by turns interesting (Crowe's journey) and boring (Phoenix's machinations and lust for his sister etc.).  It shifted from good action sequences (although they were over edited to almost incomprehensibility on the big screen....again better on the DVD) to lifeless passages outside the arena.  Russel Crowe, as usual, was very good.  Joaquin Phoenix was a joke (and I don't give a damn if he was nominated for an Oscar).  The story became more ridiculous as it went along...that an emperor of Rome would allow a man sworn to kill him to live for 10 minutes past discovering his identity was laughable.  And wound up with this Hollywood clap-trap ending where all the Romans are going to join hands and march into the sunset and restore &quot;The Republic&quot;.  This is junk writing and popular hooey. So, I give it the good rating for action &amp; production values and a good cast giving okay performances.  But if this lightweight piece of nonsense wins a bunch of Academy Awards it will only be further proof that that august body of voters wouldn't know a real film with depth and integrity from a hole in the wall.	3.0	Overhyped, Overpraised &amp; Over Nominated	2001-03-15	39	24	15

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1YC9XEDFKXPLK	Armando M. Mesa	Very few movies in the past ten years or so have caught more than my attention to want to review them with so much praise for director, actors, and yes (something that is quite overlooked and muddled in some of today's Hollywood blockbuster extravaganzas) the STORY !Gladiator is one of them (sorry Titanic or Phantom Menace, you were close runners up in my list) Where Ridley Scott was once ridiculed for directing such cult sleepers like BladeRunner or being coined as a sci-fi director only associated with Alien he has outdone himself with this astounding piece of cinematic art.As an Arizona native I, too, like Scott saw the gladiator painting in a Phoenix, Arizona museum that inspired him and his sense of direction for the &quot;look&quot; of the film. He captured it magnificently ! The only minor annoyance was the shaky and jittery camera work during the battle between the Romans and Germanians;I soon understood the overall effect and purpose of this. It was very symbolic that in time of war nothing is perfectly still or &quot;aesthetically&quot; balanced or pleasing to the eye;It is all chaos and destruction without any sense of focus.Ridley Scott put the viewer in the middle of the battlefield with this technique!...Also, while maybe Ridley Scott might have been influenced at all by such other gladiator classics like Spartacus, he avoided using typical Hollywood golden era movie star images (the good looking chiseled chin American actor witht the stylized 1940's or 50's slick haircut to play a Roman soldier in ancient times). Yet, as stated in the 2nd dvd disc he also avoided making Gladiator a typical historical time piece that read like a world history lesson in highschool from a text book ! Scott knew how to balance his directorial means...Actor Russell Crowe has definitley cemented his bonafide great actor status with this role. Had a stereotypical Hollywood pretty boy played the role it would not have had a very profound and credible overall effect to draw interest to the main chartacter Maximus.Connie Nielsen as Lucilla also proved herself very worthy ! Joaquin Phoenix played Commodus with every bit of flamboyant evil verve (almost melo-dramatic) but it worked.Actor or Sir Richard Harris gives a very fine and strong performance that does bring some classy ambiance to Gladiator when the heartwrenching story is anything but;He is a powerful presence in the film as well.The Hans Zimmer soundtrack is one of the most haunting and evocative scores that will stay in the viewer's mind for quite some time.It is both compelling and ethereal in nature that exquisitely expresses every nuance, emotion, and motion of the film and characters precisely...The dvd bonus material disc is every bit a treasure and wealth of information on the making of the film and the history of the the &quot;real&quot; Roman gladiators. The day by day diary of filming by one of the actors is an enjoyable read (if your eyes don't strain from reading your t.v. screen).With entire contents and packaging of this film it is a definite keeper for any serious movie or dvd collector.However, don't just buy it on the basis of the technical dvd aspects but rather on what is really the heart of the package;The film itself ! ...	5.0	Where to Even Begin With the PRAISE !...	2001-01-04	10	8	2

It goes by so fast and leaves u wanting to see it again.  It has everything  adventure, action, romance, elements of horror, fiction, non-fiction and a few comedic moments.  This movie is compared to Braveheart, The Patriot Conan the Barbarian and other movies and it stands up to n e on of those.  Though i feel it isn't as good as Braveheart it is very close.  Some say it's too gory  u obviously haven't watched Conan the Barbarian.  Conan is an extremely gory movie (very good movie but gory) and Gladiator would be a joy to watch after, to get away from all it's blood shed.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3LVA6QDZIOBGE	Ashegam	This is one of the better movies you'll see all year. Acting, story, direction - all come together equally. Not a 'best actor' movie, not a 'best screenplay' movie, not a 'best director' movie, but a 'best picture' movie.Joaquin and Russell work amazingly well. It is hard to distinguish a better performance between them. They are two actors at the top of their game. It is amazing to me the transition Russell Crowe made from his last role (in the Insider) to the role of Maximus in this film. Richard Harris is brilliant as Marcus Aurelius, and Djimon Hounsou is incredible as Juba, one of Maximus' allies in the gladiator ring.The special effects are unnoticable, which is the highest compliment a special effect can receive.The script, although somewhat predictable, also had some tricks up its sleeve. The pairing of Commodus and Maximus in the final bout was unexpected, yet perfect.The battle scene, and some of the bout scenes, seemed to tear a page out of Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, as the cinemtography, and general feeling reminded me of the first battle in Saving Private Ryan. However, it worked well with this film also.The bottom line here is that this is a superb picture - it riles and stirs your emotion, and demands your attention.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2VMT89TCSF105	"Ashtar Command ""Seeker"""	"SPOILER WARNING...IN CASE YOU NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE!""Gladiator"" is a Hollywood epic at its best: an action-packed adventure story with good guys versus bad guys, and some kind of uplifting moral message. Since it was made just a few years ago, the special effects are just fabulous. It's also a Hollywood epic at its worst: historically inaccurate and completely unrealistic.In other words, brace yourselves for a real treat!The main character, the righteous Roman general Maximus, is appointed emperor by an ailing Marcus Aurelius, who wants to stop his crooked son Commodus from taking power. Commodus, true to form, strangles the old man to death and has Maximus sold as a slave to a gladiator school, after first having butchered his family. Unfortunately for Commodus, Maximus nevertheless reaches Rome and the stage is set for a final combat between the two protagonists. Yes, Commodus himself challenges Maximus to a fight to the death at the Colosseum! Guess who wins? In the end scenes, the Roman senate restores power to itself as a dead Commodus lies on the arena. Maximus dies, too, but is immediately taken to Heaven where his family is already waiting for him.I don't deny that ""Gladiator"" is a great movie. But no, don't base a term paper about Roman history on it, please. Marcus Aurelius was an average Roman emperor who would have been quietly forgotten except by specialists, had it not been for his philosophical work ""Meditations"", arguably the most known and least read book in history. I tried to read it some time ago, and found it part unreadable, part morbid and pessimistic. Haven't you read it yet? You haven't missed much, citizen, I assure you. Yet, this work has earned Marcus Aurelius the reputation for being some kind of deep thinker and saintly man, when he was just another Roman dictator. And no, he had absolutely no plans to give power back to the senate (which wasn't elected anyway). In fact, he appointed Commodus his co-ruler!""Gladiator"" is probably more correct when it paints Commodus as a villain - he had that reputation already during his lifetime. Indeed, it was Commodus, rather than his father, who was murdered by strangulation. Roman chronicles also claim that Commodus fought as a gladiator for his own higher amusement. Commodus is one of the few Roman emperors denied posthumous deification by the senate, showing how hated and unpopular he was. (This seems to have been one of the few effective powers the senate had during this time.)But what about Maximus? I must say that Maximus is the least believable character in the entire movie. But then, heroes never are believable, are they? There was very little morality in the Roman Empire, a system based on slavery, wars of conquest and super-exploitation of the peasantry. Not to mention the blood sports, the persecutions of Christians, mass crucifixions and what not. In order to make Maximus a morally upright person, ""Gladiator"" has to portray him almost as a Christian! He prays to his gods or ancestors in Christian fashion, acts a bit like Jesus ""turning the other cheek"" before smiting his enemies, and ends up in Heaven.If only.Despite these inaccuracies (which I as an annoying smart alec just have to point out), I nevertheless recommend this movie.

The filmmaking style just bored me to tears. Talk about a formula. All the elements are just recycled from every other period action/adventure film. They lost me with the opening battle scene.By the way, If you want to see a great battle scene with a wonderful score check out &quot;Ran&quot; by Kurowsawa. He turns the battle sounds off and turns up the score, for a truely amazing experience.Everytime the action is indoors we get a cut and a close up every 4 seconds. No hold on the master shot where the actors are free to move within the frame. Terrible filmmaking (editing). I felt like I was watching TV with an overblown budget. Needless to say I &quot;walked out&quot; on this one early and never finished the DVD. I'd rather &quot;read the book&quot; and use my imagination.I give it one star for the effort it took to stage the opening battle scene. But then again, most of it was probably computer generated.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3S87ZOPB3UM9N	atmj	Not being a fan of overly violent movies I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this film.  There is an excellent story line here.However, I will caution you, I left prior to some of the easily anticipated violent scenes.  I just can't take the gore.  I really can't say how bad some scenes were.The movie is about Russell Crowe's main character Maximus who gets majorly shafted after many years of good service to the Roman empire.  He resurfaces after being thought dead to right some wrongs. I'd rather not say why or how as this may ruin the story for you, however, Russell Crowe was a perfect pick for this role.  He does a wonderful job.  Having first seen him in &quot;The Insider&quot; I did not know he was an actor who had many action films under his belt.  His range is amazing.The rest of the cast is equally impressiveJoaquin Pheonix oozes psychotic behavior in his role as Commodus son of Caesar Marcus Aurelius, another perfect pick.Richard Harris was an excellent pick to play the role of Marcus Aurelius and plays the wise leader with great finesse.Connie Nielsen plays Lucilla sister to the evil Commodus and displays the careful demeanor of one who is under the power of a maniac.Oliver Reed is Proximo the &quot;owner&quot; of the Gladiators and brings his exuberance last seen in the Three Musketeers to his final role.  He is a former Gladiator and longs for the &quot;old&quot; days when that meant something.The set design and special effects were wonderfully done.

The acting was superb, by the leading actor and actress and also the supporting actors.  This type of movie has not been done in a great while, so it was great to see it's kind, once again, brought to life on the movie screen.  &quot;A general who became a slave; a slave who became a gladiator; a gladiator who defied an emperor&quot;  As the plot can be summed up into a simple phrase such as that, the story told at hand was far from simple.  This was a movie which I consider epic.  The battle scenes were gruesome, yet not just thrown in there for the sheer meaning of violence.  The conversing between characters truly draws you into the movie's tale.  And the ending, while it was not extravagant, was well done and complimented this movie perfectly.  To reitterate, Truly an Oscar winner.As for this DVD itself- well done.  The video transfer was beautiful as I saw no types of transfer flaws, specs, or grains.  The musical score along with the rest of the audio department of this dvd was very, very satisfying.  DTS ES track really added to this DVD.  While hearing both of the tracks (DD and DTS), they were both stunning to say the least.  The DTS, however, had more of a spatial sound to it, more crisp, and more well-defined and deeper low frequencies.The Supplemental DVD is wonderful.  A lot of deleted scenes and a compilation of other deleted scenes compiled into a short music video.Buy this DVD, or even just rent it.

But much to my dismay, this film fell flat. Impressive as an action movie, but lame as an epic film in the same vein as Braveheart. Russell Crowe acted only a little, but did not deserve the Academy Award. The movie was too slow at times, like after the battle in the beginning. The whole time afterwards I couldn't wait for Maximus to become a gladiator because I heard so much about those Colesseum fights. Too much talking, and I really was not interested in the story at all. I do have to admit, the fight sequences were very well done, and the technique Ridley Scott used to give the film that look of quickness ( I don't know how to descibe it) works extremely well. Gladiator is nothing but an action movie. I really did not care for the characters, and it certainly did not deserve best picture. I would have voted for Crouching Tiger.	2.0	Expected more	2001-04-02	9	5	4

Dunn	If every DVD included the extras that this version of Gladiator contains, there would be at least one DVD player in every American household within 6 months. It's beautiful to see a package that puts it all together.As for the movie: There are a lot of flaws, but the upside is too far up to rate it lower than 5 stars. The main flaws are in the script, which includes far too many canned soliloquys and too much informational dialogue. Other problems crop up in the area of logistics (for instance, how did his hands get untied? isn't it illegal for a Roman citizen to be enslaved? etc.)But the numerous strokes of genius far outweigh these problems. For one thing, the movie utilizes &quot;scenes from the collective consciousness&quot; to great effect and give the movie a sense of dignified closure that I've never seen elsewhere. Stunning. Honest, my favorite scene in the movie is the brief opening shot of Maximus with his hand running through the wheat. Beautiful idea. The use of such visual tokens keep the emotional tension in the movie going until its perfect release at the end.Also very notable were the performances of Crowe &amp; Phoenix. Crowe's facial expressions told more than most of the dialogue in the movie combined. Phoenix was incredible as a tormented, unloved, and even pitiable tyrant -- he was perfect in this role.	5.0	Elysian	2000-12-16	1	1	0

The film did take several liberties from the truth:1-Commodus was not a scheming adult but a bit of a lad when he became emperor; there is no evidence he did or could eliminate his father.2-The man that killed Commodus was not an erudite military general but instead a crude brute wrestler, hired by conspirators to do the job.3-His sister was not a victim of Commodus; indeed, she conspired to have him killed; he caught her 1st and had her exiled from Rome.4-Far from being treacherous, Commodus was a relative ""babe in the woods"" who was assailed by conspiratorial senators who ""missed"" several times until that ""wrestler"" ended his reign, in a hot tub of all places."	5.0	Great film, with slight apologies to history	2007-08-04	3	2	1

Although it really isn't history the way it should be as the real Commodus was a whole lot more bizarre than this one, and Maximus is as fictitious a character as one would think based on his name. It's a good thing though to familiarize modern audiences with the likes of Marcus Aurelius, however, and the movie deserves the accolades that it got. Russell Crowe is magnificent here as was Joaquin Phoenix. The latter's career is rising at present in the same manner as the mythic creature with the production of outstanding work in both The Village and Walk the Line. They're both excellent actors and are perfectly cast in this epic. Gladiator has about all you need from a film with constant action, beautiful sets, and an intriguing plot. It's a quick couple of hours and you'll find yourself surprised at how soon it is over. I fond it delightful.	5.0	Combat, the Way it Should Be.	2007-06-24	2	1	1

And the script is right out of the old Charles Bronson revenge movies for having family unjustly dispatched by evil authority. There can never be another, ""Ben-Hur"" (1959), a movie made in its time, for its time, and an untouchable classic.This gladiator movie is for today's audience and may someday become a classic. Instead of having a splashy image like John Wayne, Russell Crowe has to blend in with the movie and the story. He must be ruthless and compassionate almost at the same time.Of course if you just concentrate on Russell Crowe, you will miss many other great actors, not the least of which is Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus. You can see him again as Brother Cadfael in ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"".What is this? The new Roman Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).

The fact I sat thru the whole end of the movie where they show the credits and where it was filmed should tell you something.This is one of my top 5 favorite movies. Yes it is violent, sad, and sadistic in many ways. But it also has a rich moral and ethical thread that I think most films lack. Especially ones that have action and violence.Russell Crowe is the heroic general Maximus, who doesn't succumb to the tempatation to kill just to kill, but sees the bigger picture. I mean, how many real men could stay centered and NOT wish at least, to kill the bastard (evil emperor Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix) who sent his men to not only kill your wife and son, but looks you in the eye and tell you in a mocking tone that your wife cried like a whore and you child sounded like a pig being slaughted when they were being murdered?Lucilla (Connie Nielsen)is Commodus' sister and there is a serious incestious undertone to the story so be forewarned. Commodus is a bitter shallow and immature man who hates his Father because he had chosed Maximus to rule and not Commodus. So not only does Commodus embrace his father (Richard Harris) in tears but with a knife to kill him. Then he sets about to make sure that Maximus is destroyed! Oliver Reed plays the trainer of Gladiators who buys and trains Maximus,not aware that Maximus will someday fight the Emperor.Derek Jacobi plays a member of the Roman Senate and I have adored this man since his days in PBS-Masterpiece Theatres I Claudius. The secenry of Morocco in NW Africa is gorgeous as anyone who has seen it can attest to. The coliseum (see how the word is really spelled?) scenes are nothing short of artistic as well as realistic.There are no perfect movies. But there are movies if you are willing to watch them who will teach you some valuable lessons, if you are open to them.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3MPEDYM4DGS5O	BigSPEEGS	"Over the years, it seems that Hollywood has forgotten how to make great Roman era epics. Watching Ridley Scott's award-winning ""Gladiator"", it was obvious to me that they still can't remember.""Gladiator"" follows the story of Maximus Decimus Meridus (Russel Crowe), the emperor's new favorite to become his heir. The emperor's son, Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix), is enraged. He kills his father and exiles Maximus, who escapes to find that both his wife and son have been killed. He is found by slave traders, who sell him to gladiator trainer Proximo (Oliver Reed, who died during production*). As he competes in matches in the Colosseum, Maximus's life soon becomes a quest for vengance.This is a brainless action movie posing as a thoughtful one. The fight scenes, when they occur, can either be exhilirating or an incredible bore. The opening sequence in Germania is yawn-inducing, while some of the Colosseum fights, one involving tigers, are quite something (albeit very similar to WWF matches).It is very hard to accept this as a popcorn flick. There's too much campy drama, brought about by a monotonous script. Apparently the writers forgot how to use a thesaurus; the words ""Rome"", ""glory"", ""vengance"" and ""kill"" (seemingly) serve as the complete vocabulary for all of Rome. The characters are incredibly flat. Smiles, good humor and anything else that would have lifted the spirits of these dreary characters are nearly nonexistent.The film's visuals are depressingly ugly, with a very limited color pallette. The audience is treated to brown, orange and tan for two and a half hours- the whole thing might have just as well filmed in sepia color tones. The special effects are bland, colorless, and lack detail. People will no doubt be impressed with the digital work to restore the Colosseum, but this feat pales in comparison to other films which have a much richer quality to their visuals- ""The Phantom Menace"" or ""Sleepy Hollow"", for example.The acting is mediocre. Russel Crowe gives a stable performance, but it does not consist of much more than yelling, grunting and stabbing. Joaquin Pheonix whimpers all the way through his performance, which gets very tiresome and comes off as pathetic. The only real balance comes from Connie Nielsen, who plays Commodus's well-meaning sister. She does well in an otherwise dull ensemble.There is no way ""Gladiator"" could have been a great film on the level of ""Spartacus"" or ""Ben Hur"". However it could have been a fun popcorn movie, had it stuck to being just that. But in the end, poor decisions in art direction, casting, and a deplorable screenplay turn this summer blockbuster into a wannabe of epic proportions.*Fancy editing and computer effects were used to give the illusion of Reed's presence in scenes he did not complete."	3.0	Oh, bother	2002-06-01	9	4	5

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3CBVOWBZIGNH0	Bill Fyffe Jr.	There are good movies and there are great movies.  A great movie has the ability to transport the audience from mere spectator to participant.  Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR thrusts the viewer into ancient Roman history through the character of General Maximus Meridius.  He is a storied hero, a man with integrity and values, honorable to his lord, Emperor Marcus Aurelius.  Although the film is not completely accurate in its historicity, Scott gives enough fact to send the audience back in time to ancient Rome, during the reign of the Caesars.The film begins on the battlefield with Rome engaging in one last conflict.  A victory will further expand the Empire and secure its quest for world domination, a worthy achievement for a Roman emperor.  Led by Maximus, the powerful Roman army overcomes the opposition in a bloody war scene, which is not for the meek and timid.  Victorious celebration follows, but Marcus Aurelius, aging and dying, is not completely satisfied.  He summons Maximus to his quarters and shares his feelings and wishes with him, as a father would a son.Marcus Aurelius: There was a dream that was Rome. You could only whisper it.  Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish, it was so fragile.Marcus Aurelius: You have proven your valor once again, Maximus. Let us hope for the last time.Maximus Decimus Meridius: There is no one left to fight, sire.Marcus Aurelius: There is always someone left to fight. How can I reward Rome's greatest general?Maximus Decimus Meridius: Let me go home.Marcus Aurelius: Ah, home.These words set the tone for the remainder of the movie for indeed this would not be Maximus' last fight.  Marcus Aurelius' son, Commodus, would soon take over the reign of the great empire and almost instantaneously, the dream that was Rome would disappear.  As for Maximus, he would suffer through many a hardship, and find himself fighting for Rome, not as a general, but as a gladiator.GLADIATOR is a great movie, and one of epic proportions.  It is so good that it can be watched repeatedly, with the audience standing in awe, learning something new with each showing.  This is a film with plenty of action thus satisfying those with a lust for bloody fight scenes.  Men especially will enjoy watching Maximus in his gladiator battles, but women will be enamored with his softer side.  He is a loyal family man, honorable, and a man of integrity.  It is also an educational movie for history lovers or anyone interested in ancient Roman history.  Scott paints a vivid  picture for audiences as he is acute to historical detail, such as the scenes from the Roman Colisseum, which give the audience a real sense of being there.  Moreover, Scott touches on some philosophical and sociological issues that will appease the intellectual mind as well.GLADIATOR is a great movie, because it has a fine cast of actors, beginning with Russell Crowe (Maximus) in the lead role.  Crowe is perfect for the part, having lost around 40 lbs. to play the muscular general, his New Zealand accent adding a touch of a classic quality to the role.  His performance was outstanding and the success of the film depended on it.Playing the part of the antagonist was Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus) who was equally sensational.  He was definitely in character as the evil ruler, but also excelled in his alter-ego, a very frightened little boy who could not live up to his father's wishes.  Moreover, the supporting cast was wonderful from top to bottom, but add two seasoned veterans like Richard Harris (Marcus Aurelius) and Oliver Reed (Proximo) to this list and you get a great movie.  On a sad note, Reed passed away soon after shooting the movie, but the film was dedicated to him in the credits.  His role as Proximo, the trainer of gladiators, was excellent as his character was both tough and funny.In conclusion, many different qualities must come together to distinguish a good movie from a great one, and Ridley Scott has hit on all eight cylinders.  GLADIATOR belongs in every family's movie archive, yes, it is that GREAT.	5.0	Gladiator...A Movie of Epic Proportions	2002-01-20	4	2	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1EKTLUL24HDG8	Bill R. Moore	"Gladiator is one of the greatest films of the last several decades, a cinematic masterpiece transcending time and genre. Part drama, part historical, part action, it is all excellent.There is no weak point, but the story is perhaps most immediately gripping. A superbly crafted tale full of spectacles, twists, and intense drama, it is set in one of the Roman Empire's most interesting times; the movie is dramatic, moving, and above all engrossing. Very few films have pulled me in so completely; it is engaging nearly from the start, never fails to hold interest, and has one of the most spellbinding climaxes ever. This last not only literally had me on my seat's edge but also had my heart beating rapidly and seemingly in my throat.Much has been said of the battle scenes, and they are indeed among the most brilliant ever filmed. The choreography is top-notch, the actions are performed skillfully, and everything -- setting, lighting, music -- is perfectly complementary. Above all, it is unusually realistic, so visceral we almost feel it. This is far from the usual light Hollywood fare; people bleed, scream, and die, and all is shown with stunning verisimilitude. Perhaps most fundamentally, and certainly most surprisingly, this is never corny or overdone. Some controversy unsurprisingly resulted; quite a few viewers thought the violence over the top, with several known to me being unable to sit through it, including some usually not prone to such things. The squeamish should certainly be warned; those averse to graphic violence will probably not like the film, though this should be obvious from the title alone. That said, it is important to remember that the film is set in a particularly bloody part of the always bloody Roman Empire; their wars were brutal even by war's standards, and their ""games"" are perhaps unmatched in the sad roll of humanity's penchant for making violence a spectator sport. Many films portray the Roman Empire, but few make its horrors so astonishingly clear, which is to its credit; the subject had been whitewashed long enough, and no serious treatment can continue the trend. Unfortunately, as always in such cases, this leads some to like the film for the wrong reasons. It is important to realize that Gladiator is not glorifying violence; it indeed in many ways does the opposite by showing war's futility and destructiveness plus the fatal effects of unchecked monarchy and petty revenge. The film takes the Empire as it was, for better or worse.As deserved as the action's acclaim is, it unfairly diverts attention from many other excellences. For example, though it is obvious why action fans would love Gladiator, it is far more than an action film. It is in fact profoundly emotional; I have known several people to cry over it, including one not known to have cried over any other movie - and indeed only a few times ever. The story of Maximus, one of modern film's more believable, immediate, and deeply stirring heroes, is incredibly rousing. We immediately feel for him despite his apparent brutality - perhaps even in part because of it, which says much about the film's remarkable subtlety. His struggles and triumphs move us greatly; several scenes affect me more powerfully than almost any other film's. Perhaps Gladiator's most notable aspect is diversity; dramatic and action-packed as it is, it also has more than a little romance and even some humor. It is one of the more well-rounded films in recent memory, strongly pulling us in many directions.Also highly noteworthy is the vivid Roman Empire recreation. This has again been attempted often but rarely, if ever, as successfully. Director Ridley Scott of course had the benefits of CGI - unthinkable in the days of early Roman film epics - but wisely avoids overusing it. Nearly any other director would have relied on it to realism's detriment, but he skillfully mixes it with sets and straight footage, creating a stunning montage. Few films are so visually breathtaking; the Empire's vast reach is on clear display, from Rome's grandeur - still hardly matched - to distant steppes, forests, and fields. The coliseums are also well-done. Everything is in place; costumes are superlative, lighting is just right, etc. It takes a rare film to bring a distant era so vibrantly to life, but this succeeds beyond all expectations.Historical epics were an early Hollywood hallmark but were long out of vogue by 2000. Gladiator helped resurrect their popularity and reputation, but few attempts to replicate its success have even remotely matched it. Verisimilitude is what makes it work, but it is important to keep in mind that, despite being a historical film, it is not strictly historical. The settings are of course real, as are many characters and some events, but Maximus and most of the plot are fictional. This is no fault; the film does not pretend to tell history. The important thing is that everything seems plausible and is well-done; one should hardly expect more. Anyone wanting documentary-level history will be disappointed, but Gladiator does the important service of making an important time seem interesting and relevant; it has doubtless lead many to look into the era more thoroughly, which is what a historical epic should do.It is of course impossible to talk of Gladiator without enthusing about the amazing acting; one would be hard-pressed to find another film with such consistently fine performances. There is no weak job, but a few stand out. Russell Crowe's starring role is deservedly praised; Maximus is one of the most multi-dimensional film heroes one can think of, and he pulls off all the angles with mesmerizing force. Crowe has a presence that few actors have and most would give nearly anything for; he need not even speak to convey very powerful emotions. This comes to the fore, as he moves from a tough guy persona worthy of any pure action hero to thoughtfulness to tenderness and seemingly everywhere else. However, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is even better - nothing less than one of the greatest of all-time. His Commodus is one of the most fearsomely convincing villains in screen history; the depth of true savagery he conveys is simply astonishing. Yet he is far from a one-dimensional villain; a conflicted, complex individual, he has many facets, and Phoenix portrays them all so deftly that we alternately revile and (almost) feel bad for him. Several of the lesser characters - notably Proximo, played by Oliver Reed in his last role - are similarly subtle.All told, Gladiator deserves to stand with the all-time great films; it will surely be looked on as one of the decade's best, and anyone wanting a truly great film would be wrong to miss it."	5.0	Bold Masterpiece	2010-06-10	4	2	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1U6T98GNPQIYM	BillyB	I got a laugh watching this movie times simply because the actors didn't even attempt to hide their true accents or try sounding Roman.  And if you watch the fight scene that includes Tigers, you can see the Tigers lying down (and sleeping) in the background. I doubt that this was intentional humor.Overall, the movie was kind of a blur for the action scenes then slow and plodding during the drama.  I predicted the final outcome 20 mins into the movie and was sadly correct.  The script just didn't have any life to it.On the positive side, Russell Crowe has a great voice and the non-incestuous sister was very attractive.  Although the computer animation was obvious, it was impressive to see Rome in all it's glory.Rent before you buy may be my best advice on this one.	2.0	Every accent except Roman	2000-11-26	21	6	15

Anyways , everyone who lived on this planet for the past 20 years has defenitely heard or seen clips of this movie. It's good and Ridley Scott does a great job at directing this big film because that is what it is! The film spans all the way to a war with barbarians and other opponents in the beginning to the war within Rome's own human civilization. Anyways Maximus is a true warrior in the film and I love the old fashion tactics they used when fighting against the herd of monsters from within the colesium. If you liked films with very early history crossed with a struggle and rise story of a warrior than this is a movie to buy for you, a friend, or family member.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ATTH8NXFF9W0W	"""blairest"""	I first saw this movie in the theatres against my own will because I had heard it was so bad. Two and a half hours later the  bad things that I had heard about the movie were confirmed, so I dismissed it as just another Waterworld-like Hollywood flop. But several months later I saw it get nominated for and win the major golden globe. Whatever, the Golden Globes are stupid. Then it beat Traffic at the oscars also. I was wondering if i had seen the same film as everyone else. So I took another look at it, and its flaws were more present than ever. It was just too standard a film. Nothing special about it. There was the typical plot of the protagonist losing everything unfairly and then having to get it all back himself using whatever means necessary. The visuals were very good, but that's about it. Russel Crowe won the Oscar, and it made up for his loss in the previous year, but this was in such a bad film that he won. The golden age of Roman Movies is long gone. We hadn't had one in so long I guess everybody wanted it so bad to suceed and be a good movie. And everybody thought it was a good movie. With the exception of the realists who judge a movie based on its content, not its idea. Because you can have the best idea in the world for a movie, but it's all in the execution.	1.0	Not Anything That it is said to be	2001-06-17	16	4	12
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AE0E6UII0VSZA	Blake Kleiner	As much as I love the opening battle sequence of &quot;Gladiator,&quot; the jerky camera movements and strobe-like appearence made me dizzy to the point of almost falling out of my chair. Blood and guts are strewn across the screen like confetti on the first day of the millennium and right in the middle of it is one of the more compelling (and depressing) characters of the year 2000. Russell Crowe is one of the best things about the movie &quot;Gladiator,&quot; because with all of its spectacle and grand battle sequences, it lacks in the dramatic sense and its special effects are so video game-ish at times, I thought I was watching a medieval version of &quot;Final Fantasy VII.&quot; Some of the sequences involving the colosseum are so see-through and fuzzy that I was tempted to laugh, but the truth of the matter is, a movie like this isn't measured on the quality of its visual effects and dramatic highpoints (it actually does have a few). A film like &quot;Gladiator&quot; is graded on the superb nature of its art direction, cinematography, battle sequences, the courageousness of its hero, and the length of the venomous fangs of its villain. On those levels, it succeeds as well as any Roman epic ever made. Russell Crowe does make the perfect hero, and Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as Commodus. The dramatic highpoints, which we always know are coming, but the payoff is worth the wait, are very well written. The battle sequences are plentiful, and when they don't look like they were shot with strobe-vision, they are extremely intense. The art direction is fabulous. We are actually stepping back in time with this film. It looks and feels real as we watch it, despite the bad special effects. And of course, a film like this, on such a grand scale, needs a director who has directed many influential films over the years. &quot;Gladiator&quot; has Ridley Scott, who has directed such films as the 1979 sci-fi horror epic &quot;Alien,&quot; which was only surpassed by James Cameron dynamically intense &quot;Aliens.&quot; He has also directed &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Thelma and Louise.&quot; There are more, but these are the true heavy hitters.The basic plotline of &quot;Gladiator&quot; is Rocky on a series of downer narcotics. Russell Crowe is the leader of the Roman armies, General Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is the &quot;father to a murdered son, husband to the murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance in this life or the next.&quot; (Those lines are delivered with such power that I slammed my fist down with a &quot;hell yeah&quot; in the theater) And it is true, Maximus was betrayed by the newly crowned Emperor Commodus, after Commodus killed the rightful leader of Rome, his own father, Marcus Aurelius, the last of the good emperors. Commodus is one sick puppy. He kills his father to make sure Maximus does not take the throne from him, which was the wish of the dying Aurelius, plans to take his sister as his queen (yuck), and instead of dealing with the plague proposes a series of games to keep the people of Rome occupied. (&quot;He'll give them death, and they'll love him for it.&quot;) Commodus has it all worked out, until the supposedly dead Maximus removes his helmet and announces his resurrection to the entire empire. Commodus thinks he can deal with this by arranging a series of unfair fights that he believes will end up with Maximus as the loser - meaning dead. But Maximus isn't so easily taken down. He can fight. OH MAN, CAN HE FIGHT! The plotline moves like a convential fight movie, with the scarred hero and the fiendish villain, and we know that by the end of the movie, Maximus and Commodus will fight. This much goes without saying, but &quot;Gladiator&quot; does have its fair share of surprises, and those pleasant events make the movie worth watching.&quot;Gladiator&quot; doesn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar, that honor, I believe, belongs to &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&quot; but it is truly heroic filmmaking of the highest calibur. I just would've liked to see something with better visuals and a better handled sense of drama. Not that I'm knocking &quot;Gladiator&quot; for its faults (I own the movie). Almost every movie has its faults; &quot;Gladiator&quot; just happens to wear its flaws proudly.	4.0	The talented Mr. Ridley	2001-03-16	9	3	6

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	`Gladiator', directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe succeeds, like `Spartacus' and unlike `Troy' because it is less about action and violence than it is about politics and righting a wrong. In fact, except for the opening battle scene with the Russell Crowe improvised line, `On my signal, unleash Hell', the combat direction and filming is not as well done as Brad Pitt's battle scenes in Troy. This is not to say `Gladiator' did these poorly. It's just that the real interest is in the political conflict between Commodus, Marcus Aurelius' son, played to the hilt by Jaoquin Phoenix and Crowe's character, the Roman general Maximus.Regarding the historical action and scenes, I think the film's set designers, costumers, set decorators, and special effects artists got almost everything almost exactly right. In fact, it is a great treat to see talented special effects put to good use on something other than star destroyers, Nazgul, and vampires. The effects lavished on the Coliseum were not just for the sake of impressive size. They added lots of very effective touches such as the relatively recently discovered awnings used to shade the fans in the upper bleachers. Combat, both in pitched battle in Germania and in the arena is very well researched. It was an excellent little touch to see Maximus loose a sword, only to instantly draw a backup sword from his saddle and continue reigning death and distruction on the barbarians. It's amazing how a minor inaccuracy can ruin the effect of some of the very best movies, such as when modern tanks were used in battles between Americans and Germans in North Africa in `Patton'. You would think they could scare up at least a dozen American Sherman tanks and a half dozen German Mk IV's. Similarly, I really began to wonder why Aurilius' daughter seems to be wearing but a single style of earring throughout the whole movie, which covers at least a year of real time.Note that most of the special effects really succeed better on the small screen than they do on a big theatrical screen. The seams between live action and the effects seem to be a bit less noticeable.I have been a Russell Crowe fan since I saw him in `LA Confidential' and I doubled my respect for his abilities when I saw his appearance on the Bravo interview show, `Inside the Actor's Studio'. In that one-hour interview, he revealed a greater insight into the craft of acting than the interviews of William H. Macy, Robert Redford, and Robin Williams all rolled into one. If any actor can be said to have inherited the mantle of Marlon Brando, James Dean, and Montgomery Cliff, it must be Crowe. In this interview, he said that the cast and crew began shooting the film with not much more than an outline. This may seem typical on a Jim Carrey or Robin Williams comedy where the producers are reasonable in expecting the great improvisational talents of these actors to carry them over the rough spots, but this seems inconceivable when you are shooting a historical costume drama with a budget of over 100 million dollars. It turns out that some of the most effective lines in the movie were Crowe inventions on the spot. The importance of Crowe to the movie cannot be underestimated, as the intensity drops by several notches when Crowe is not on the screen, and by several more when neither Crowe nor Phoenix are on the screen.The three veteran character actors, Oliver Reed as the gladiator master, Richard Harris as Emperor Marcus Aurelius, and Derek Jacobi as the Roman senator, Graccus, competently carry out their roles, but none are quite as convincing as the second string actors in the great Masterpiece Theatre series `I, Claudius'. Their performances also cannot hold a candle to the similar roles in `Spartacus' played by Peter Ustinov, Laurence Olivier, and Charles Laughton. I think this is not from lack of talent, I think it is from poor writing. The only other important role, Marcus Aurelius' daughter, is very weakly played and written. Against Crowe and Phoenix, the part really needed a much stronger presence such as Angelina Jolie, Hillary Swank, or Charlize Theron. These quasi-historical characters need both powerful performances and recognizable faces so you instantly know this is an important character, since they will probably be on the screen for less than a quarter of the movie.All of this is interesting to gab about, but the real meat of the movie, again, is politics. This shows that even in dictatorships, even those backed up by hereditary legitimacy, having the backing of the nobility and the army was required to carry out your agenda. As far as I have been able to determine from my reading of history, much of this story is fictional, based on the real Emperor Marcus Aurelius, his campaign against the Teutons, his death, and the succession of his son, Comedus. I can find no trace of the character Maximus. Crowe's description of the genesis of the character in his interview convinces me that he is pure invention, which the writers were to name `Narcissus'. Crowe talked them out of that one. But that is neither here nor there. The drama is based on the fact that as a gladiator, Maximus gains the favor of the crowd by his victories in the arena, and Comedus cannot dispatch him except in a public venue.I must say that the music written for the movie, especially for the dream sequences when Maximus anticipates returning to his family in Elysium (heaven of Roman religion), is especially effective, even if the tunes and the vocals have a very strong Gaelic sound to them. The dream melodies would fit quite nicely into the elven scenes of `Lord of the Rings' as they do in ancient Rome.`Gladiator' may not endure as a classic like `Spartacus', but Crowe's performance alone is worth the price of admission.	5.0	A+ for Crowe and Phoenix.Greater political drama than action	2005-03-13	1	1	0

It is a compelling story told by a strong cast, backed by breathtaking cinematography and a haunting musical score. It is an unparalled blend of action, morality and romance.

But the poor quality of the DVD is a disappointment, especially for a Blockbuster movie like this. I came here to check and see if others were having the same problems and it appears so. I wish they would re-release it again on DVD and make it right by replacing any and all defective copies, but now I'm just dreaming.....	4.0	Would've been 5, but the DVD has defects!	2000-11-28	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1KH4YPTSETHOC	bookaddict01	I saw the movie at the theater.  It was definitely worth my money.  I rarely go out to the movies and when I do, I always feel cheated out of my money.  They're usually so short but Gladiator is about 3 hours long.It has everything an epic needs.  It has adventure, blood, intrigue (not too much to bore you), righteous hero, etc.  The movie is about honor and survival(and some other stuff that I couldn't remember since I watched it several months ago).  It's very touching.  The movie was realistic in that it got some of the less savory sides of humanity in it.  One of which is the fact that the prince is in love with his sister.  Incest does happen often in those days.  The other thing was that his family was killed horribly.  The ending was quite sad but appropiate in light of what happened in the movie.  You'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.I wouldn't recommend it for little kids 'cause it has too much violence and my little brother and cousins almost fell asleep watching it.  They're under 6.  Hehe.  I would give it 4.5 stars.  Hope you find it just as good as I do.	4.0	Great epic!!!	2000-10-16	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1781C6P9VMU9Q	Book girl Eva	I read several reviews and product descriptions trying to find Ridley Scott's directors cut of this movie, and only got confusion.  Several reviewers talked about a code listed on the bluray but that would not help me make the right purchase.  I decided to just pick one and thankfully made the right choice the first time.  So here is the actual answer, the bluray with cover saying sapphire series is the directors cut.  The additional scenes in the story mostly involved Connie Nielsons character Lucilla.  You get to see just how far she had already gone against her brother even before Maximus had showed up.  Other than that the story is basically unchanged.	5.0	This one is the directors cut	2014-04-15	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1KRGKPRPES8Z5	"Boris Malagurski ""from Subotica"""	"Gladiator revisits the epic genre last seen in Ben Hur and in Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus. Scott's Gladiator successfully explores the formidable savagery of the Roman gladiator games and the ageless and universal appeal for violence.Having proven his valiant commitment to Rome, the great General Maximus (Russell Crowe) earns the respect of his army and of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Weakened by a lifetime of war, yet conscientious of the brave and noble nature of his General, the dying Caesar decides to appoint Maximus as his successor and bewilders his ambitious and amoral son Commodus. Before the true successor is officially announced, however, Commodus silences his father's wishes, coerces his observant sister Lucilla, rises to power, and condemns Maximus and his vulnerable family. Escaping death, Maximus is sold into slavery and is trained as a gladiator by Proximo, who knows how to exploit the spectators' thirst for violent entertainment, and who teaches Maximus the importance of winning a crowd. Driven by the mission to avenge Commodus' cruelty and corruption, and guided by his unshakable principles and sense of justice, Maximus is transformed from a slave to a hero.Gladiator is the product of the carefully choreographed sword fights, of magnificent set design, especially the reconstruction of the Coliseum, accurate costume designs, and weaponry design. Gladiator captures most of its glory in the heroism of its main character Maximus, the General/Gladiator. The character's strength and appeal derives from a well-developed role and from Crowe's accurate personification and skillful performance.Gladiator, however, owes most of its success to its clever exploration of the notion of ""spectatorship"". By providing violent images of the gladiator games, the film portrays the Roman crowd's thirst for violence while simultaneously confronting the film's spectators with their appeal for screen violence. In this manner, Gladiator connects the violence of the arena with the violence of the screen and establishes a common ground between the ""Roman mob"" and the ""movie theater mob"". Consequently, Gladiator manages to lure the viewer into reacting as the Roman crowd does, ultimately rejecting the villains and sympathizing with the inspiring hero, as the Roman crowd does. All in all, Gladiator is a spectacular film that cleverly uses its poignant images and its powerful characters to create a dramatic story that speaks of the corruptibility of the human mind and the redeeming powers of love and justice."	5.0	A sword-and-sandal epic!!!	2005-05-27	2	2	0

It's one of those three hour movies that seems like it's an hour long and you're disappointed that it has to end so soon.  There is never a dull moment thanks to the outstanding direction of Ridley Scott.  The cinematography is equally amazing as is the performance of Russell Crowe.  The story is rivetting, thrilling, captivating - yet plausible.  It has all the ingredients of the perfect guy movie: a villian that you develop a seething hatred for, and a hero with such courage, strength and conviction that you can't help but feel his every pain, share his every emotion, and admir... him.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2MSOMM8D4XHDL	Brandon T.	GLADIATOR is the best movie I have ever seen. It is grand in scale, with an excellent cast and plot. General Maximus Decimus Meridius was a loyal servant to Emperor Marcus Aurelius (played wonderfully by Richard Harris). Upon the emperor's death, Maximus is betrayed by Rome. He then must become a gladiator to win his freedom. His quest for freedom will make for a great film.This film has grand special effects that transport us back to Ancient Rome. We are able to see the splendour, the atrocity, and moral decay that was Rome. We look past this, as we see a great man's struggle for freedom and justice. This struggle is the main point of this masterpiece. If you like violence, fighting, or period pieces you will love GLADIATOR.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3SEPNBSUYNO92	Brendan	The premise for Galdiator was supposed to be based on the gladiator fights in the Coliseum. Having done a report on the Coliseum, I was very exited about this movie. But it is a major disappointment. The movie is 2 hours and 35 minutes long but there are 15 minutes of battles or less. Most of the movie is a bunch of dialogue and more than half of it has no significance to the story. The special effects are OK but not spectacular. Some of the more ambitious shots look about as realistic as a CG cinema from a video game.  I don't see how a lot of citics think it's one of the best movies ever made. It's not a perfect film. I seem to be the only one who agrees with Ebert who gave this film 2 stars out of 4. The only Acadamy Awards I would give this film are Best Actor for Russel Crowe, Best Director(the screenplay is not Ridley Scott's fault), art direction, and costume design. Gladiator will definitely be nominated for Best Picture but I hope it doesn't win. If it does, you'll know why the Acadamy Awards building will be on fire the next day.	3.0	Good looking film but not much else.	2000-12-19	3	1	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1SJMXUTAGNQV3	Brian Heffernan	Okay, so I bought this BD release of Gladiator. I spent MY money on a supposed BD version. Well, after three and a half hours of sitting comparing the BD to the DVD. I can officially say that the BD looks maybe a hair better than an upscale of the DVD. This is an abomination. Especially, with a film of this calliber. How could you not go frame by frame and want to get the best picture quality out of the original print. This is the type of film you want to see with 1080p and the best picture possible. How dare they market this as a BluRay release. Very sad. We should all sign a petition, send it to Paramount and demand they re-release this film in all of it's splendor. I will be returning this movie. I could have just watched the DVD and picture wise, not have missed much. However, DTS HD MA is beautiful. That is about it though. So very sad. There is nothing saphire about this. I have seen older movies that have been released on BD that look better. As Maximus rose above in this film, we too should rise above this atrocity and demand a re-release correctly done!	1.0	Is this Blu-Ray or an upscaled DVD! Thanks for nothing!	2009-09-02	23	18	5

The Signature DVD was DTS which came out about 3/4 years ago, why on earth would they re-release Gladiator (for the 4th time) without including the DTS soundtrack. My advice would be to but the signature series if your gonna buy Gladiator, unless you dont want the amazing sound to go with your cool movie.PS.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture, and nominated for an additional seven, Gladiator is one of the best produced and directed films of its time. Reminiscent of Mel Gibson's Braveheart, it creates a world so seemingly realistic, that you find yourself drawn backward in time to the glory days of Rome. The musical score, the costumes, and the sets form a synergy that, with lifelike animation, serves to replicate life in early millennial Rome.The opening scene of Gladiator is simply awe-inspiring as the Roman legions advance on a band of rebels resisting the empire from the outskirts of Gaul. When the commanders signal the order for attack, the fury of hell is unleashed as flaming arrows and iron bars batter the unified front of the rebel fighters. The scene invokes more memories of Desert Storm than an ancient battlefield, and it visually illustrates the overwhelming power that was once the Roman Empire.The leader of this battle is Maximus (Russell Crowe), a Roman general loved by his men and admired throughout the empire for his impeccable character. When the aging Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) secretly reveals his plan to appoint Maximus caretaker of Rome upon his death - willing him the task of restoring the Senate and eliminating the dictatorial rule of the Caesars, it sparks the ire of his overly ambitious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). When Commodus murders his father, he asks Maximus to provide his allegiance to the newest emperor of Rome. But Maximus refuses, and Commodus orders his death.A magnificent fighter in his own right, and enjoying the aid of friends in the legion, Maximus manages to escape his death sentence. Traveling thousands of miles to his home only to find his wife and son murdered, a broken Maximus is taken prisoner and sold as a slave to a man named Proximo (Oliver Reed). The older man hopes to profit from his slaves by training them to become gladiators.At this point, the true action of the movie takes hold, as Maximus (ideal soldier of the Roman Empire) runs roughshod over his opponents in the gladiatorial arena. With every conceivable weapon of the time deployed against him, and sometimes facing down a number of opponents simultaneously, Maximus leaves the ring time and time again as a triumphant victor.Having enriched his owner, Maximus eventually makes his way back to Rome where he plans to fight as a gladiator in the greatest arena of all - the Coliseum. Meanwhile, Lucilla (sister of Commodus and former lover of Maximus) works as a power broker behind the scenes, attempting to bring the Senate and the army together in order to remove Commodus and restore the power of the Republic. When Maximus defies Emperor Commodus in front of a packed house at the Coliseum, he's forced to remove his mask and announce his true identity to the Roman people. The revelation leads to an unprecedented gladiatorial contest - Maximus versus a sitting Roman Emperor, with the victor acquiring total power. But the sleazy Commodus has a few tricks up his sleeve, and he doesn't plan to give in easily to arch enemy...As a work of entertainment, Gladiator is second to none. The action sequences provide endless thrills, and the dialogue between the characters is wrought with political intrigue, lust for power, and conflicting realities. Russell Crowe is superb in his role as the hero Maximus. Noble in his intentions and powerful as a leader, Maximus represents the ideal of honor and chivalry. One of those rare films that forces the audience to root for its characters, Gladiator is a definite must-see film.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AKBKTA49ZTT2T	Bruce	&quot;Gladiator&quot; is a film that should suit all tastes. It is an expertly mounted and eye-filling event; the blood and gore, delivered in split-second imagery (allowing your head to fill in the rest) should satisfy the most blood-thirsty movie goer; and the story is a superb tale of good vs. evil, power vs. honor, and &quot;Might for Right&quot;. I was reminded of &quot;Camelot&quot; many times during this film, especially by the almost unrecognizable appearance of Richard Harris as the wise and noble Marcus Aurelis. Joaquin Phoenix gives a bone-chilling performance as the evil and cowardly Commodus, who inherits the title of emperor upon his father's death. But the sole weight of this overwhelming piece rests on the shoulders of the magnificent Russell Crowe. If one doesn't believe in him, then one doesn't believe in this epic costume drama. Kudos to the rest of the cast as well, and hand over heart for the late Oliver Reed. But back to Crowe--he is an actor to contend with.  His work in &quot;Gladiator&quot; is a tour de force performance; he very nearly sprays testosterone from the screen.

This is the first Crowe movie I have ever seen and I am impressed. Very impressed. This man can act.I also think Jocaquin Phoenix is an excellent actor. He plays a character that you just love to hate and he is really good at it too. If it comes down to talent, I must say Phoenix did a wonderful job and he is a much much better actor than his brother ever was. I think Hollywood should keep an eye on this man ~~ he is talented. Between the two of them, I can see why they took over the world by a storm. One classically noble and one pathologically weak. This is a movie between good and evil, for the greater cause and for love.Gladiator is a movie for both women and men ~~ it really shows humanity in its best and vilest forms.

THIS WAS FIGHTING IN THE 'EAT YOUR NEIGHBOR, SHOUT AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS' MODE, THE COLESEUM DAYS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. THE MOVIE HAS A GREAT CAST AND THE ACTING IS GREAT AS WELL. FROM ALIEN TO GLADIATOR, RIDLEY SCOTT DOES'NT DISSAPOINT. RUSSEL CROWE WAS PERFECT AS WAS OLIVER REED. I ALSO LIKED THE DOMINANT CHARACTER MODE, ALA BRUCE LEE, SEGAL, AND SUCH. MAXIMUS WAS UNBEATABLE, ESPECIALLY WITH A GRUDGE. THE FIGHT SCENES ARE TOP NOTCH, SO ARE THE SPECIAL EFFECTS. WORTH BUYING.	4.0	GLAD TO HAVE SEEN IT!	2001-01-24	9	3	6
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A30MZG2NZJEW06	c1nn1c	Ordered from Amazon on 12/10/10.  The version that arrived is the remastered one.  Basically, it's awesome if you get this version.  Yes, the colors are a bit amped up over the prior release, but the EE and DNR are gone and it looks amazing. This has been one of  my favorite movies since it came out and I am very happy with the quality of this remastered version.  Tons of special features as well.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2PL1SCQ38US2A	"Cainz ""cainz"""	I still don't understand why most people who review DVD's only talk about the movie itself.  If you're like me, you already have seen a DVD before you buy it, right?  So I'm going to tell you about what you really need to know:  How does this DVD sound?  How does this DVD look?  Are the extra features any good?First things first.  If you haven't seen this movie, you need to go out and do so.  It is THAT good.  Okay, now that that's out of the way, we can get to the other stuff.  We'll start off with the picture transfer.  The picture in this DVD is great.  I can't say that it's as clean as say, A Bug's Life or Toy Story (which are pretty much transferred straight from the hard drive to the disc with nothing in between), but I can say that the picture is great.  As a matter of fact it's among the best.Next: the sound.  Now the sound is simply AWESOME.  Not only does it have 5.1 Dolby Digital, but it also has DTS 6.1.  Both sound great.  The opening battle scene alone is great for showing off that killer sound that you have in your high end system.  Even if you don't have a receiver that decodes 6.1, you can still get a great 5.1 DTS sound using the 6.1 sound option that the disc offers (you'll just be missing the one extra rear speaker) and it still sounds great.  So as long as your receiver or DVD player decodes DTS and 5.1, you can get great DTS 5.1 sound.  You'll literaly hear, feel, and see the sound of flaming arrows fire from left to right and vice versa.  If you're an audiophile like I am, you'd buy this DVD just becuase of the great sound alone.  While on the subject of sound, I must also mention that this movie has one the best muscial scores/soundtracks of any movie.  The music just adds an entire other dimension to the movie, and suits the movie so well.Finally, there are the extra features.  This DVD has tons.  Deleted scenes, documentaries, behind the scenes, etc.  It's got so much that there is an entire disc devoted to it.  I thought it was interesting to see how Russell Crowe really was outside his Gladiator character.  This DVD scores VERY high marks in this category.So all in all, this DVD is worth EVERY penny and then some.  It has everything you can ask for!  Now even if you thought the movie was only decent (there are actually a few that might think this), the other areas are so great that you still have to pick this DVD up.  The only thing that I thought they could have added that they didn't think of?  I think it would be cool to have an audio option where you can just watch movie with only the music and nothing else (the Matrix DVD has this option), but that's only becuase I love the soundrack so much.  Now if this is my only complaint, how good can this DVD be?  This DVD is that good, and then some.  And more.  Whatever your last DVD purchase was, well, I'm confident enough that I'd bet that it wasn't better than this one.	5.0	A must have DVD	2000-12-06	20	17	3
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1MIWBKD4YVO2R	Caley	This film is absolutly, undoubtably the best film i have ever seen! It has something for everyone. Combining Action with adventure, Mystery with Romance, you'll be on the edge of your seats i asure you! I think that Russell Crowe delivers an amazing performance as Maximus, the roman general turned slave gladiator! The score to this film is also a must have, there are two versions of the soundtrack, i have both and they are both excellent. My opinion: Everyone should (MUST) Have a copy of this film.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1EOAELG023FJK	Can Erzi	When I first heard that Russel Crowe was playing a gladiator in his new movie,I was a bit disappointed because I didn't think it would be anything original,and that he only did it for the money it would bring.Obviously I was wrong..Probably this movie will for a long time be compared with Braveheart,since both are epic movies about historical heroes,but I don't think it is fair to say that the Gladiator imitates Braveheart.It's the story of a Roman general,Maximus,who is very much appreciated and loved by both his soldiers and the emperor.The emperor's son though,doesn't share those feelings and when he learns that the emperor likes Maximus to replace him,instead of his son,he decides to get rid of both Maximus and his family.Maximus manages to escape,but can not save his son and wife from death.He is capured by the merchants and is sold to a gladitator trainer.From then on,it is :&quot;the general who became a slave.the slave who became a gladiator.And the gladiator who defied an empire.&quot;Russel Crowe is amazing.He adds so much to the character he is playing,an ideal human figure,a Roman soldier who is all about honor.Joaquin Phoenix is also veru successfull in the role of the villain,so to speak.The music is also great,I highly recommend the soundtrack.There is no reason not to like this movie.Although the level of gore is a bit high,it is inevitable I guess for a movie about gladiators.The dvd extras were very good,and the picture and sound quality are among the best I have ever experienced.Don't hire it,buy it.How can you regret it ???	5.0	A great film	2001-03-03	9	6	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A30GTGZX6QTYPC	"""caphispbr"""	*Gladiator (R)- Ridley Scott is a favourite director of mine and I waited anxiously for this.  While I was never bored during the films lengthy running time (even when so much of the time is spent fawning over unimpressive CGI shots of the Coliseum), I was absolutely enraged that the film is basically a remake of The Fall of the Roman Empire and the screenwriter's of that far superior film are not even acknowledged.  If you want a roman epic, rent Ben Hur, Spartacus, The Robe, Fall of the... or countless others. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant.	2.0	Ripoff	2002-11-23	8	3	5
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ADKCBWT99D0Q4	"Captain Jax ""captain_jax"""	"The epic may have passed from popularity decades ago, but every so often the genre crops its head up and shows us just why these types of movies are so compelling.  ""Gladiator"" is a solidly acted movie and well directed.  I'm not going to hide the fact that Ridley Scott is my favorite director, and this movie is a good example of his directorial talent.  ""Gladiator"" certainly has its drawbacks, the most obvious existing in its historical inaccuracies.  Although the rewriting of history is irksome, I have to admit that this is only a movie.  As such, it's primary concerns are maintaining quality acting and artistic vision.None of the emperors - Marcus Aurelius and his son, Commodus - are true to their historical personas.  In actuality, both were very strong individuals.  I tend to think that ""Gladiator's"" Commodus is more like Caligula or Nero - obviously insane with dysfunctional sexual tendencies.  However, since this movie is not a biopic, this is not a major concern.  It's intention was to create a compelling story centering around a fictional general.  Both Richard Harris and Joaquin Phoenix (especially Phoenix) create multi-dimensional characters.  The ending, which I won't spoil here, is completely inaccurate, but, again, I don't consider this a detractor from the film.The only real thing that bothered me in this film was, firstly, the ""iffy"" dialogue the studio squeezed out for Oliver Reed's Proximo after his death.  I suppose recasting his character would have been impossible and disrespectful to Reed, but I don't think that they did an adequate job continuing on his character.  My second criticism is that the movie didn't show enough of the Roman Senate.  I would have liked to have seen how Commodus's rising power affected that elite class as a whole, but then again, that probably wouldn't have been in keeping with the nature of the film, which centers around Maximus.Again, a solidly acted movie with the spectacular Ridley Scott at the directorial helm.  Give up your reservations against its historical inaccuracies and embrace its artistic vision."	5.0	A Great Movie in the Vein of the Classic Roman Epics	2004-05-09	1	0	1

I won't go into the story summaries as so many reviewers have already covered that territory, but this film is definitely a winner for women, as well. The story is engaging, the acting is amazing, and the cinemetography is divine. I'm the type of person who cried at the end of Terminator, so I know my tastes aren't for everyone, but this movie wasn't just a blood bath or gorefest as some people -- my friend included -- say.

We also love director Ridley Scott's &quot;Bladerunner&quot; and expected that he was up to the task of taking on those two ground breaking films with his &quot;Gladiator.&quot;  Unfortunately, this is yet another film where everyone involved got so carried away with the special effects, blood, gore and mayhem, that the other elements of film making were given short shrift.  Russell Crowe's talent, stunningly seen in &quot;The Insider,&quot; comes across at only one level here, as a war machine.  There is no real character development other than motivation given for his having nothing to lose by going all out as a Gladiator.  Phoenix, however, does a nice dissipated villain and shows lots of promise for future roles.  We were ready to give this DVD two stars and then watched the second disk on the DVD, the one with all of the special features.  There was fascinating material on this disk about the &quot;how to&quot; of the movie and about the history of Rome and gladiators, which we really enjoyed.

This seemingly endless film gets two stars only for the presence of the late great Oliver Reed (who has played much better roles), and decent costumes and fighting sequences.Gladiator tries to be a Ben-Hur or a Spartacus but instead succeeds in being only boring and laughable.Comodorus's character was particularly inane, and it is impossible to believe that all those soldiers couldn't bring down Maximus-great soldier or not.The film's plot, if you can call it that, is totally uninvolving. I found myself completely uninterested in the plight of Maximus, and the killing of Maximus's son and wife was just predictable and lame.I kept checking my watch to see how many more interminable minutes were left. Avoid at all costs, if entertainment is your aim.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1W4HQPL1GXHLO	"Casey Crookston ""Casey Crookston"""	I know this film came out almost five years ago, but I just watched it again last weekend and I can't resist logging onto Amazon and telling you how inspiring this story is.I'll skip talking about what a great actor Russel is (and he truly is) and jump right to the heart of the story.  Ridley Scott has created for us a tale of a man who was born to be a warrior but who at heart is a gentle, sad, kind hearted man who wants nothing more in life then to honor his wife and son, and the depths to which he searches his soul to reach that goal left me more aware of my own place in life and how I must strive harder to lead a more fulfilling existence.I don't see this as an action film.  Okay, I know that it IS of course, an action film, but to be honest the fight scenes are few and far between.  Yes, there is some blood and gore.  No, it is not excessive.  Yes, people die.  No, it is not glamorized.The real story takes place out of the Coliseum and comes to life in the dialog:  Maximus (Crow) with his soldiers and fellow gladiators, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) with his sister, Commodus with the Senators, Maximus with the child Lucious.  The dialog is remarkably well written, and the acting is stunning.  THIS is where the real story takes place.And to punch-down what was already a timeless masterpiece, the cinematography, the special effects and the music are humbling in their perfection.  Normally these are aspects of a movie I don't pickup on until the second or third time watching it, but in Gladiator ever element is so rich and beautiful that you can't help but be impressed with all of it from the very first time you watch it.This film is not for everyone.  Despite how inspiring it is I don't think I would like my own son watch it until he is well, well into his teenage years.

It has action, drama, great cinematography, outstanding fight scenes, love, great acting, and most importantly, it's a great story.For those who haven't seen it I don't want to give away the entire plot.  Briefly, Maximus, the virtuous and victorious commander of the Roman army over the Visigoths, is asked by the dying Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, to become the protectorate of Rome upon his death and return the rule of law to the Senate, making Rome once again a Republic.  Aurelius's evil and ambitious son, Commodus - fully expecting to made emperor himself - will have none of it, striking out against his father and destroying Maximus.  Maximus becomes a slave, then a gladiator, eventually finding himself fighting in the Roman Coliseum in front of his nemesis, Commodus.The story has somewhat of classic plot line - similar in some ways to the Tale of Monte Cristo as Maximus seeks revenge, but more than revenge, he seeks to carry out the wishes of a dying emperor and a higher cause.  The movie also paints Maximus as the classic Republican citizen, who wants nothing more after securing victory for Rome than to go home to his family and farm.  Unfortunately, events conspire against him as he forced to make yet another sacrifice for this country.  Even at the bitter end he seeks to serve Rome.On a side note, unlike others I didn't find the special features that interesting.  They were pretty typical ""The Making Of"" documentaries.  And the historical piece was not that new, to me at least."	5.0	One of my Favorites	2004-05-27	4	1	3

I compared the the screen shots and it is the not-as-digitally scrubbed version.That said this version does sadly suffer a bit (IMO) from a change of color (vs. previous release and dvd) as it is has been updated to the match the newer Hollywood trend of making everything more blue/teal & orange.

Some of the acting is humorously terrible (like the scene where Commodus kills his father, oh dear...)

I am even more impressed that it is better quality then the theatre version. They fixed the colours and what not.

It grabs your interest and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film.Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a once-wronged soldier now fighting for justice.  Ancient Rome was nicely replicated in this film, as I truly felt like I was one of the townspeople during the movie.  The background setting and props used were fantastic, and they all added to the overall feel of the movie.Crowe was exceptional.  Not only did he look the part, but his acting was wonderful in this role.  Joaquin Phoenix was downright scary in his excellent role.  His evil, incest-loving character was portrayed perfectly, and frankly he made me hate him, so he did his job well.  You could feel the intensity between the two every time that they were on the screen together.The plot was a little shaky at parts, but it flowed rather nicely during the the long film.  Throw in an amazing musical score by Hans Zimmer, and you have one complete film.  The fighting scenes alone are worth the price of the video.  These exciting scenes are tremendous and you won't be able to stop yourself from cheering Maximus along.This film is exciting, action-packed, and yes, it is quite graphic.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3K8POFWCQI2GS	Char	"This is probably the most spectacular recreation on film, ever, of the ancient Roman Empire.  The camps of the Roman armies, the villas, the cities, all the detailed sets and costumes are awesomely real creations.  I've watched the movie twice and have liked it very well both times.  I've felt glad to be able to view such an outstanding SCENIC  treasure.  I think that's the Number One most excellent thing about the movie.  You truly feel as if you're there in the midst of the drama that's going on.The next very good thing about the movie is that it tells a very gripping story.  It includes much blood and gore of brutal combat, but there is a serious religious-spiritual theme that figures into the story as well.  The viewer sees the protagonist's sincere worship of pagan gods who are addressed in terms reminiscent of Christian worship, ""Holy Mother"" and ""Holy Father.""  These seem to be tutelary spirits that the main character interweaves with his devoted love for his wife and son.  (No orgiastic pagan behavior here.)  One learns that among these pagan Romans, there is a belief in the afterlife.  There are concepts of ""righteousness"" in these ancient people that the viewer, as a modern conscientious person, can identify with.  Ultimately the movie is worthwhile and satisfying not only because the viewer responds to the immense courage of the ""General,"" the ""Slave,"" the ""Gladiator,"" but also to his tender love for his wife and son, and the mysterious promise offered of the future love reunion in ""eternity.""As the story opens, General Maximus reminds his soldiers to fight under the motto of ""Strength and Honor.""  He reminds them that ""What we do in life echoes in eternity.""  After a long and successful campaign, all General Maximus wants is to get back Home, but his destiny is to keep fighting for the dream of his beloved Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, who wants to give back power to the people of Rome by ending  political corruption in the Senate.  The reinstatement of Republican integrity would rekindle the ""Glory of the Empire,"" the Great Light that had shone from pre-corrupt Rome.  Maximus ends up fighting to vindicate the murder of Aurelius by his ambitious and vicious son who jealously seizes power in place of the fatherly love he feels deprived of.  (You feel sorry for him but unfortunately he is apparently a really unlovable snake.)Eventually, the Roman Coliseum appears as a terrible Death pit.  And it's there that Maximus will seek to win his Freedom.  Because of his relationship with the Emperor's sister, and her relationship with a senator who seeks to restore a wholesome government, Maximus fights ultimately to restore Right rule to Rome.The most memorable thing for me about the movie was the way it depicted the near-death experience and then the final passage into the afterlife.  There was a door-gate which was the entrance; there was a big field of tall grass; there was the road that led to the villa that was ""Home.""  Home, at last.All actors did great.  The casting choices of actors were excellent.As loaded as this film is with masculine contests, conflicts, and fights, I don't think any guys would complain that this movie is a ""chick flick.""

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AB34G6VKP28L	"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic"""	Opening in the age when Rome ruled the territories from Israel to the coast of Ireland, the film introduces us to the greatest military leader they have ever known, Maximus (Russell Crowe), a man favored by the dying emperor to succeed him in power. Caesar (Richard Harris) believes Rome has been corrupted and knows the people are unhappy with the current government. His desire is to instill a democracy where the senate and elected officials will have more power than the emperor. Maximus is a natural leader. The people follow him without question... if he were able to persuade those in power in Rome of the worth of this ideal, Caesar's dreams of a powerful self-governed nation would come to pass. But his son and heir Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) stands in his way. A power-hungry, mentally deranged young man who has long sought his father's good opinion, the future emperor of Rome is not about to let solitary rule to slip through his fingertips. Commodus murders his father and asks the allegiance of Maximus to the throne. The general scorns him, and is in turn punished. Maximus is taken into the wood to be executed, his family to share the same fate.Managing to escape from his keepers, Maximus flees home... but is too late. His wife and son have been murdered, his fields and harvest burned, his home laid to ruin. Driven by revenge, he vows to avenge their deaths one day. Weak from battle and injury, he's captured by a caravan of slave traders. His new owner intends to use him as a gladiator, to earn favor in the violent sport of Rome. Unwilling to fight in the training duels, Maximus proves himself unbeatable in actual combat. His distaste for this cruel, barbaric practice is evident. In the meantime, Commodus knows the senate plans his removal and entertains the Roman people with the promise of great sport. There will be 63 days of gladiator games in the great coliseum, to honor the memory of his father. Maximus' greatest desire is to fight in those games, and stand before the emperor... so he might deliver the fatal blow.Only one thing stands in his way... the beautiful Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), a former lover and older sister of Commodus. She knows her brother's evil nature, suspects he had a hand in their father's death, and must constantly reject his overly friendly affections. These elements combine into a story that, while theologically is way off, represents the age of Rome excessively well. The magnificent buildings, the violence of the gladiator games, the cheering of the crowd. We have the wronged hero who must fight to survive. The beautiful woman in distress, and the cruel villain, who in key scenes reveals a childlike helplessness. Gladiator won Best Picture, among numerous other awards, and is well worth it. The screenplay is rich with authentic, memorable dialogue. The grand scale and costuming are impressive. The acting is first-rate. Though put into spattering blood a bit, the CGI is incredible. The movie has a slightly sober but moving conclusion.Though having been warned about graphic violence and gore, Gladiator was much less bloody than I anticipated, but still uncomfortably realistic. I am not fond of movies that are violent simply for shock value, and this is not one of them. What it is, is an extremely moving film that shines with the elegant brilliance of a bygone era of filmmaking.	4.0	"""What we do in life echoes in eternity."""	2012-03-22	2	2	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1SDHFGT5J7SYV	Charles J. Dickens	"As universially popular as this movie is, I am apparently a closet case. I hated this movie. The saving grace is Joaquin Phoenix. Now although I understand in the world of internet reviewers, my assessment means squat, but I think I need to get this off my chest.Gladiator is an over-hyped money machine that happened to be released in a down year for Oscar worthy contenders. The huge reason why is because it is nothing more than the merger of Spartacus, Ben-Hur, with some Braveheart sprinkled in for good measure. There is even a scene in which a ""teacher"" paints a would-be gladiator with different colored paints to show the different kill areas of a body while in combat - an alomst exact copy of Spartacus. I don't understand what the appeal is to this movie, except that those other movies have been long since forgotten and this can be viewed as a ""fresh epic.""Another overrated aspect of this film, aside from the film itself, is Russell Crowe. While I admired his work a year later in A Beautiful Mind, he didn't show me anything Kirk Douglas couldn't do. Oscar voters were floored by his ability to look angry and mumble lines and swing a sword. Tom Hanks, who also was nominated that year for Cast Away, had to lose 70 punds, grow a 2 foot long beard and carry a movie by himself for 75 minutes, but Crowe's ablilty to kill people was one of the greatest acting jobs ever! I'm being sarcastic, by the way. Phoenix, who plays the villian, is the one who wowed me. He appeared to actually loate Crowe, as I'm sure people do when Russell goes to a bar at night and starts beating them up.I'm not a fan of Spartacus either, but rent that instead of over-rated hype machine of 2001, otherwise known as Gladiator."	2.0	GladiSpartaBrave-Hur	2003-08-23	11	6	5
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3P6K06RFJEIHH	Charles Phoenix	The movie formula is well known:  hero taken from his place, his family mutilated, his land destroyed, he is flung into misery, he vows revenge, he endures several trials, he is the best warrior with incredible constitution, he fights back to the top, he wins the crowd, he is betrayed in his chance for an easy victory, he, nonetheless, overcomes the setback and kills the evil nemesis and saves the dignity of his people.  Most obviously, this is Braveheart, but it is as well numorous other recent films, including borrowing the bizarre spirituality of Messanger.  Did I mention that the movie was set in a dark, miserable time?Besides the tiring plot, the pretentious, silly, third person dialogue and myriad accents nearly draw laughter.  Third person works for Shakespeare, particularly when the production doesn't try to produce accents.  In this film, we have New York, Australian, California, English and Nordic accents.  It is painful -- particularly in light of the fact that most of these areas were not known to the Roman empire.Still, the visuals are Scottian.  And, that we expect from his great films and commercials.  Still, it is not enough to remove this movie from its misery.Perhaps most troubling is the disclaimer at the end of the film stating to the effect that great care was taken to protect animals from harm.  It does not, however, say that no animals were in fact harmed.  That is truly sad considering that this film is no leap forward in art and that Tigers and Giraffes have their own problems in the wild.  The horse scenes were brutal and, I suspect, it would be difficult to train any of these animals without some degree of abuse.Come to think of it, this movie is shameful and reprehensible.	2.0	Tiresome;  It's a long way from Blade Runner	2000-12-10	8	2	6

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A10FFJ44K8G4Z2	cheese_in_a_can12@yahoo.com	This movie was okay, and maybe i should have given it at least a three, but what I am trying to stress is that this movie, while good, was totally filled with holes in its story that it wasn't even funny.  And Russel Crowe' performance was [bad]!  The only good scene was when he was crying, with how he acted the rest of the movie, they probably had to zap him with a cattle prod for him to do it.  The Academy made one of their worst mistakes this year.  They gave Gladiator an oscar for Best picture, and it should have been given to Traffic.  And Russell Crowe won the award for Best Actor instead of Ed Harris for Pollock! ( the Academy was probably making up for when they didn't give Crowe an Oscar for &quot;The Insider&quot;)  Ed Harris was excellent in Pollock, the story of Jackson Pollock a painter who was really crazy, and had a pretty bad life.  Traffic was so much better than Gladiator, it makes you wonder how the Academy sleeps at night.  Traffic is about the war on drugs.  I would tell you more about Traffic, but I want the film to intrigue you from beginning to end as it did me.  While I am outraged at the Academy for their mistakes I realize that Academy Awards mean nothing, and it is really if you like the movie or not.  So go see Pollock, The Insider, or Traffic.  They are excellent movies.  Don't waste your money on this garbage.	1.0	traffic was better	2001-03-30	19	8	11
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2FS38D943KX12	chefdevergue	"I can't say that I hated this movie.  It just didn't particularly engage me.  It is a movie that can't decide what it wants to be...is it your typical summer action flick, with lots of blood and gore and special effects, or is it a political thriller, full of scheming, machinations, treachery and betrayal?  This movie tries to have it both ways, without success, the result being that it is supremely boring much of the time.It is pretty obvious early on, after a nice big battle scene to open things up, that we have a tried-and-true story of revenge underway.  The unbelievably heroic Maximus is betrayed and his family slaughtered by the evil emperor, blah blah blah...it is obvious that a showdown is brewing.So why don't we get to the showdown already?  Instead, we get blah blah blah...Marcus Aurelius blathers a bunch of gobbledy-gook and nonsense to Maximus about restoring the Republic (oh sure!)...blah blah blah...we find out that Commodus is evil and corrupt, but all he really ever wanted was his father's love and approval, blah blah blah...the emperor's sister has had the hots for Maximus all of this time, blah blah blah...the senators are frustrated with the emperor's indifference to administrative affairs, blah blah blah....oh god just make it stop.  None of this blah blah blah-ing is of any real substance, so you just sit through it, waiting for the next gory fight scene.I enjoy movies that have plenty of dialogue, and some of my favorite movies have not a whit of violence in them.  But the massive amounts of dialogue in this movie do nothing to propel the plot forward.  It only bogs the movie down.  Trying to make the characters multi-dimensional in what is, in essence, a live-action comic book, in fact makes the characters only look all that much more ridiculous.  Don't try to make Commodus look ""sympathetic"" by portraying the conflicted nature of his relationship with his daddy...who cares?!?  He is merely a plot device, like so many Shakespearian villains.  He does not need to have his motives explained.  So don't explain them, again and again.Even the fight scenes left something to be desired.  Why not just stick a bunch of cardboard figures in the stand and a stuffed tiger in the arena?  The technology certainly exists for making better special effects than this, for crying out loud.When my wife brought the video home a second time I popped it in and started to watch it.  Without realizing it at first, I fast-forwarded through one combat scene to the next.  Ultimately, I realized that this is truly the proper way to watch this movie.  It should take you only about 35 minutes this way.  How efficient!Never mind the appalling liberties that the movie took with historical fact; I think we all have come to realize that no movie is going to be particularly faithful to the historical record, especially where Rome is concerned.  With movies like this, the viewer is not looking for a history lesson (I hope), but it would be nice to have some decent pacing so that we don't die of boredom between the fight scenes."	2.0	Tedious Maximus	2002-08-27	12	3	9

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1M39P7MO277FV	Chinmay Hota	My respect for Oscar Awards received a jolt watching the movie. The jury has probably been carried away by the exotic subject matter, the inherent brutality or by the purportedly grand spectacle of the Roman Empire. Or may be some unknown consideration has influenced their decision. To be impressed by grand scale only, without caring a fig for storyline, characterization, smacks of childishness. Even in that parameter `Gladiator' will get a thumbs down from me. Richard Attenborough recreated a grander scale in `Gandhi' and handled more people on the sets, without sacrificing order and coherence.Haste seems to be the bane of the movie. So much has been squeezed into so little-both in terms of space and time. Both the opening battle scene in Germania and the fighting scenes inside the Colosseum present such a medley that even someone with 6/6 vision will be left groping for sense. And the murky shots will help compound his woes.Speaking of time, the narrative and characterization get a raw deal on that account too. Ultimately the movie comes out as a smorgasbord of disjointed visuals replete with blood and rage. This story of chivalry, velour, revenge, Roman politics, intrigue and not forgetting incest deserved a slower pace and more gradual development.The only saving grace for the movie is the masterly acting of Russell Crowe, the Gladiator.	2.0	Thumbs Down	2001-06-11	15	7	8
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3D3L8R0OW7WX6	"ChipBoy ""ishbees"""	Gladiator was an excellent movie and has all the aspects required to be a true blockbuster.  Crowe is awesome as the General Maximus and provides an intensity and depth of character that truly makes the viewer emphasize with his trials throughout the film.  Tragically, Oliver Reed, who plays the owner of the gladiator camp, died during filming.  Apparently they digitized his face for the remaining scenes and I thought they succeeded.  However, I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can look for the cover-ups.  Getting back to the film, it appears to be pretty historically accurate.  Commodus did in fact die at the hands of a wrestler/gladiator, although I doubt it occurred in the Coloseum!  The opening battle scene is as intense as any on film, and I guess I was a little disappointed that no other large battles occurred during the rest of it.  In short, great cast, great plot and great cinematography.	5.0	Hands Down Best Film of Summer	2000-09-22	2	2	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1S2GLK5CM8HLI	Chris Bock	What a directorial tour de force for Ridley Scott. Since getting hooked on the DVD format, I have come to appreciate director's more and more every day. This film is a beautiful mix of cinematic artistry, state of the art effects, powerful music by my favorite composer Hans Zimmer, fantastic acting from the entire cast and Ridley Scott weaving it all together masterfully.This genre of film has had some real tragedies and this film showed what could happen in the hands of a true craftsman like Scott.The extras are true blessing especially when it comes to the deleted scenes. In the commentary running with them Scott says they were all sacrificed for time and that is a shame as they were really fantastic even if they did end up on the cutting room floor. They added so much development to the characters especially that of Commodus played by Joaquin Phoenix. Aside from having a humorous name, (a commode is a toilet), he was really a sad man and Phoenix dialed right into the pain he felt of not having the love of his father.	5.0	Ridley Scott at his best!!!!	2003-07-09	0	0	0

He wraps himself in this character and makes it his own, which gives the viewers a sense of compassion towards this being and understands the pain and anger that he has. Joaquin Phoenix is great in being the villian of the film; this is a role that I haven't seen him in before and his acting capabilities just shine and proves that he's an actor that has many tricks up his sleeve.Director Ridley Scott, is fantastic in showing us the grand scale of The Roman Empire, with his glorious battle scenes and the magnificent scale of the Art Direction that is found with the Roman Statues and Architecture. Scott establishes that he's a director with incredible vision and oustanding declaration for what he wants to present.Everything in this film is presented on a grand scale, which makes it's Oscar win for Best Picture the more deserving, since, it's a film that shows the true meaning of human emotion and a cinematic experience that can only be expressed in one word: Epic	4.0	An Epic	2003-09-14	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AHY02FW3KXSXH	Chris DeVaas	"""Gladiator"" is loosely based on a Hispano-Roman general from the Roman province of Hispania (Russell Crowe as Maximus). Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula (now Spain and Portugal). Under the Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed Callaecia (or Gallaecia - modern Galicia in NW Spain). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the vicarius for the Hispaniae (the Celtic provinces). The name Hispania was also used in the period of Visigothic rule. The modern name Spain derives from Hispania."	5.0	Loosely based on a Hispano-Roman general from the Roman province of Hispania	2013-03-31	1	0	1

The special effects at times were a little obvious and unrealistic-looking, but overall they did a great job. The bonus disc has some great extras that add a lot to the viewing experience. I would recommend this movie to people who liked Braveheart, but don't expect Maximus to be William Wallace. They are completely different movies, but you could see similarities between the two movies. In any case, Gladiator has action, romance, and some great dramatic scenes that should be appealing to most movie enthusaists.	4.0	A worthwhile buy	2001-02-05	2	1	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ	Chris Fung	The more I think about this movie, the more I think Ridley Scott deserves to be dope-slapped with a bloody sandal.  OK, for the record, I have seen both the DVD and the cinema version and I agree with all the technical praise heaped on the movie. Like Blade Runner (a much better all-round movie), the Matrix and Brazil this is another great mood-piece.On the down side, this was a movie that had many many massive logical flaws in the plot, some of the dialog was dreck and the depiction of Roman society, Roman army weapons and tactics and Roman politics &quot;Gladiator&quot; offered was less accurate than Asterix the Gaul. Actually, that's an insult to Goscinny and Uderzo since they genuinely had affection for those times.The following are my pet peeves: Why does it only take Maximus a few days to get from Germany to Spain on one horse?  Realistically it would have taken at least two weeks (no airbus in those days guys).  Why do the slavers take him to Morocco (Another long land trip, a sea journey and valuable water resources on the walk through the desert?)  Was that the only place in Ridley Scott's ancient world where you could sell an anonymous guy?  The list of annoying inconsistencies goes on but I will only bore you with a deconstruction of the now-famous battle scene at the beginning of the movie.If you just wanted to watch a bunch of guys hack at each other in the mud, then the opening battle scene was great. As I said, it was beautifully filmed and produced, but why did the commander of the entire army place himself (with no staff, bodyguards or signallers) at the head of a cavalry unit which was supposed to outflank the enemy and attack downhill from the rear?  Hello? can any one say &quot;chain of command&quot;?  Why did the Germans obediently line up on the edge of the wood so the Romans could mow them down with arrow-fire?  Germans were renowned for sneaking up on people through the woods and then ambushing the pursuit (e.g. the destruction of Quintillius Varus' three legions in Teutoberg Forest in 9 AD). Why did the Romans fire all those fire arrows and flaming siege-engine bolts at the Germans?  There was nothing to set fire to (no houses, defensive works etc).  Why did the Romans not follow standard battle practice and obliterate the first ranks of the Germans with their heavy javelins (pila) before the Germans closed?  The answer to all these questions is the crux of my complaint against &quot;Gladiator&quot; and why I think it only deserves three stars:Historical accuracy and dramatic integrity were sacrificed at every turn so the movie would &quot;look good&quot;.  This is OK if you are doing fantasy, or a NIKE commercial, it's even OK for dramatic licence if it aids the story, but the needless underlining and heavy-handed plot structure(Roman Army general, good, evil emperor, bad) totally reduced Gladiator from what it could have been (a thoughtful look at power, war and charisma) to a simple-minded WWF spectacle in Roman Drag.  Those &quot;Nubian&quot; charioteers were also extremely hokey and stupidly &quot;exotic&quot;.Needless to say, this movie came nowhere near to being the Best Movie of 2000 in my humble opinion.	3.0	Visual fluff plus swords	2001-04-12	17	11	6

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1HDKL3YGMWWK6	Chris Kreft	Many critics of the year 2000 have stated that there really weren't any good movies this year. They were wrong. Gladiator is an exceptional exception to the rule! Having watched several Russel Crowe films previously, I was unimpressed initially with the fact that people were raving mad about it and yet it stared Crowe. So I went along to watch it for myself.The film begins with a battle scene more realistic than any other film before (that I've seen anyway). When you think about a battle, you think knights in shining armour with glory charging down the mountainside to slay all the enemy, almost without loss. This battle was grim reality. In the heart of a German forest, amidst the oncoming winter, the mud and the grime, rank upon rank rank (excuse the pun, if you get it) are standing bravely waiting for the barbarian attack. The battlescene is horrendously gruesome with many killed and wounded on both sides. How the directors managed such realism is beyond me and shows the potential for the cinema in future films.The storyline continues, Crowe (the general in the aforementioned battle) being exiled by the cruel new emporer to become a circus gladiator. The rest of the movie follows his extremely melancholy life, in which wife and child are murdered, and he earns a reputation as one of the greatest gladiators in the arena. The film ends with Crowe fighting against the emporer in the arena. The emporer secretly wounds Crowe before the actual fight to give him an advantage. I won't say who won, or it would spoil the ending, but I will say that the Gladiator isA MUST SEE!Unless you can't stomach the gore, in which case I do not recommend it. For everyone else, though, this is definitely one of the best of all time, and you will miss out sorely if you never watch it...	5.0	Russel Crowe at his Best!	2001-01-08	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A17QRPKZWOT9LU	Christine MacDonald	Russell Crowe is the reason this film won an academy award. His performance as Maximus blew me away; it was if I had never seen a movie actor before. He took a role which could have been one-or-two-dimensional and from the moment we meet him, he encompasses everything Maximus is supposed to be: a leader, a fighter, a farmer, a man who loves his family, a man of honor,  and a spiritual man. It's so hard to actually put your finger on it, but his facial expressions and the way he delivers such lines as, &quot;what we do in life echoes in eternity&quot; and especially the speech where he states his name, &quot;loyal servant to the true emporer, Marcus Aurelis, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife,&quot; -- I defy anyone that hears Russell deliver that speech to not feel something. The music swells up, the crowd is cheering, the gladiators yell &quot;Maximus&quot;. A definite favorite movie moment for me. I do think Gladiator an average story and it is; but Russell, and Russell alone, takes a film with some great filmmaking and lifts it up to a point where we feel we've seen a great film.  I really believe this would have been a summer blockbuster ignored by the Academy at the end of the year if it hadn't been for Russell Crowe. I do have a lot of respect for Tom Hanks and Ed Harris, but I must say I cheered when Russell took home the prize. Cudos to Ridley Scott and the opening battle sequence as well; but I challenge anyone to really watch this movie and not see that Russell was the soul. I have this on DVD with surround sound -- the only way to watch it!	4.0	Russell Crowe Reason for Oscar Win	2001-04-10	4	2	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A352ULL611TIYJ	christopher b. banks	In the same vain as monumental action/historical pictures: Spartacus and Braveheart to name a few. Gladiator serves well to keep the tradition strong. The story of General Maximus of the Roman Empire is an inspiring journey of persaverence and elevation despite the odds. Maximus is ousted from Rome during a cruel conspiracy headed by the less than moral &quot;heir apparent&quot; Commadus. Without divulging any key information, subsequently this is when the &quot;fun begins&quot;. During his odyssey he is transformed into an entertainer for the masses who crave the blood and guts arena in which he performs. An overlooked screenplay is blanketed by the unreal vivid action scenes. These seat gripping scenes are ultra violent, but fit well within the context of the story. So, I feel comfortable attending this movie with a mature twelve year old. If you have the chance, I suggest you view this movie in a wide screen DVD environment to capture the true essence of this great movie!!	5.0	HAIL CEASER!!	2001-01-19	1	0	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2Z4WNIGC6XHRU	Christopher Derer	While the film's sweeping scope is best appreciated on the large screen, this transition to home video is most commendable. The motion picture by itself is worth the price, but the inclusion of an additional DVD full of bonus features is a remarkable deal.I'm not going to ramble on to praise Ridley Scott and his talented production crew, or Russell Crowe and the excellent cast; I see that there are a couple hundred other people who have already done so. I wanted to post this review to chide the film's detractors. Everyone is a critic, but some of the comments that I have read are petty, ignorant, and unwarranted:One person wrote that the film is too long to be properly compressed onto one DVD. I assume that this gentleman is a digital engineer who designs and manufactures DVDs.Several reviewers complained about the lack of realism and unsatisfactory computer-generated effects. I understand that George Lucas' ILM company is looking for their resumes, as they must certainly know how to produce superior results.A reviewer of the movie's soundtrack on another site derided both Hans Zimmer's majestic score and Lisa Gerrard's exquisite vocal work. With a combined output of 65 film soundtracks, other successful projects, and numerous awards over thier respective 20-year careers, you think they'd be able to get it right by now. Undoubtedly, this critic's worst composition must be much better than either Zimmer's or Gerrard's best work.Some individuals were unhappy with Russell Crowe's performance. One in particular felt the need to comment on the actor's excessive body hair. Assumably, this person is not only a respected acting coach, but also runs his own salon.Several patrons of the arts flexed their critic skills by blasting the director's camera work and choice of shots. Perhaps these professionals can give Mr. Scott some pointers on his next project, after they've finished dusting off thier Oscars.Numerous observers found the script insubstantial, lacking complete story elements and character development. As far as I can discern, there is a beginning, middle, and end, conflict and compromise, well-defined characters, and resolution of the plot. Perhaps these reviewers might impart their years of film school education and scriptwriting experience to improve this weak fable.Then there are the Rhodes scholars who found the film's story to be implausible and historically inaccurate. They might not be aware that this is a work of fiction designed to entertain people, not a documentary.And let's not forget all those comparisons to &quot;Brave Heart&quot;, &quot;The Patriot&quot;, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;Ben Hur&quot;, and even &quot;Titanic&quot;. I look forward to these reveiwers' analyses of apples and oranges sometime in the future.Thankfully, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, regardless of accuracy or relevance. &quot;Gladiator&quot; will probably not garner the industry accolades that it deserves at the 2001 Academy Awards, but it will forever stand as one of the most impressive productions in motion picture history.But what do I know?	5.0	The Greatest Movie Ever Made	2000-11-28	8	4	4
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AMBD7H16O0BS6	Christopher D. Jacobson	"As you've probably read from other reviews, there's a new Blu-ray transfer of this film, which originated in Europe (first released in the Netherlands I believe?). By demand, and perhaps under pressure from Universal in Europe, Paramount are slowly putting out the new transfer in the United States.However, they seem afraid to admit their mistake, and so the whole thing is pretty secretive. So far, there's no new release with ""remastered"" or any such phrasing on the cover, nor is there a way to tell which discs have the new transfer save for one little detail (which may not even be 100%, but most people who've brought home these copies are reporting they have the new transfer, as do I):On the back of the case, NOT on the slipcover, normally there would be the words ""2-DISC SET"" above the Paramount logo in the lower right corner. If on the case itself the text isn't there, and it's just a blank space, chances are it's the new transfer. BUT KEEP IN MIND that it doesn't matter if that space is vacant on the slipcover; I made the mistake of bringing home a copy that had no text above the logo on the slipcover, and it was the old, shoddy transfer, and ""2-DISC SET"" was above the logo on the actual case itself.There is another thing to look out for which may not apply all across, but people have been reporting that the new transfers don't have a white title sticker on the top of the case like most releases do. Mine didn't. So if the ""2-DISC SET"" text is missing on the case, and there is no title sticker, it should be a definite thing that you're getting the new disc (but no promises).As for the transfer itself, it's really quite astounding--one of the best, most detailed, most richly filmic Blu-ray transfers I've seen yet. For fans of the film, or even if you're not too keen on the film but are an HD enthusiast and just want to behold the capabilities of the Blu-ray format, I suggest this Blu-ray--the new, ""remastered"" one. The old one really is a pile of dung, with loads of digital noise reduction to wipe out the grain and all detail with it, and tons of edge enhancement to try and compensate for the eradicated detail, causing figures to ""pop out."" It's a mess of a video master done for DVD ten years ago; this kind of thing was done on the DVD format so that the film could be ""most visible"" on small standard definition TVs. It does not pass in the high definition realm.Very highly recommended--if you can find the new transfer. Hopefully Paramount will start making it more obvious which copies of the Blu-ray have this new transfer, with a yellow UPC bar or something, or a new release altogether, promoting the new, greatly refined video master.(Apparently there is an exchange program going on for those with the old disc who wish to have the new, both in the US and the UK. Look up The Digital Bits' daily column to get information on that.)"	5.0	NEW Blu-ray astounding	2010-08-07	11	10	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A10EMKHAMBIYFG	Christopher Dvorak	Very bad Picture Quality!I was excited to buy this blu ray, but then I started looking at the reviews.  The picture has been treated with EE (edge enhancement), (DNR) digital noise reduction, and other filters which make the picture quality much worse than it should be.  Looking at screen captures, this is very obvious. One such glaring errors is a large numbers of arrows are erased from a shot because of what is believed to be a scratch removal filter.  I await a good transfer and will most likely buy that day one.	1.0	Bad picture quality	2009-09-01	29	24	5
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3NLH4A3XP4WA5	Christopher Graff	Russel Crowe stars in this awesome epic of the late Roman Empire, and the treachery that riddled within it.  Crowe, stars as general Maximus, the dedicated soldier of Rome, ever ready to die for his cause.  Little did Maximus know that the emperor Marcus Aurealis had chosen him rather then his son to succeed him to the throne.  Once his son, Commodus got word of this, he immediatly killed Aurealis and attempted to murder Maximus and his family.  Eventaully escaping to become captured and throne into the colloseum, Maximus must play the deadliest game of all in Rome.  Crowe convincingly plays his part, making up for the small gaps in the plot that plaugue the film.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2OAAI7R7MMPBK	"Christopher Nash ""misterphp"""	Gladiator is a fine, well made film which offers great entertainment and some excellent performances. But although it takes it's inspiration from 60s movies The Fall Of The Roman Empire and Spartacus, it can't compare with those great films on some levels. The much hyped CGI set of the Colosseum, for example, doesn't look as impressive as the sets built by Samuel Bronston's team for The Fall Of The Roman Empire, because those sets were actually BUILT and what you see on the screen is real. Also the visual sweep of both films is unmatched here. Spartacus and Fall really do offer a feast for the eyes, but for me at least, Gladiator can't quite manage this. To my eyes, CGI can't hold a candle to solid reality.The acting is fine in Gladiator. Russell Crowe is superb as Maximus; easily the equal of Kirk Douglas' Spartacus - and I'll concede he's far superior to Stephen Boyd's equivalent character Livius in Fall. But the greatest pleasure for me was to be found in veteran actors Richard Harris (Marcus Aurelius) and Oliver Reed in what was sadly his final role as Proximo. Harris manages to invoke subtle shades of his King Arthur from Camelot to the Roman Emperor weary of war and wanting only the best for his people, while still portraying a substantially different character. Reed reminds us once again of the genuine talent so often obscured by the public persona in his portrayal of the callous gladiator school owner who regains his humanity.Where Gladiator does triumph, is in it's abilty to express the sheer depth of the inhumanity and evil that drove the Romans to lust for gladiatorial combat. It's portrayed unflinchingly in all it's gory horror. Censorship in the 60s prevented Stanley Kubrick from this in Spartacus, although he pushed the envelope as far as he could. A simple shot of a terrified man urinating himself in fear captures the horror perfectly.In the final analysis, however, it doesn't ultimately compare with the classic 60s films which inspired it, though it remains a worthwhile and enjoyable modern epic.	4.0	Fine film making, which almost approaches it's inspirations.	2013-01-18	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A15GES70P0P0QC	Christoph Gassenschmidt	This is another case of a well prepared advertisement campaign. Weeks before the film entered the cinemas the world was praising the film as something nobody else had ever seen before. Now, there lay exactly the problem. The 1964 version of &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (with Sophia Loren) tells more or less the same story but without all the sound effects available now. Take those Dolby Suround/THX effects and you will have a very dull story. That's why I insist watching The Fall of the Roman Empire might lack some technical quality but it beats The Gladiator in most parts. If you like battle scenes and man-to-man fights you get the right movie. Anything beyond that is an insult.	2.0	Disappointing	2001-03-19	24	12	12
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3PKO2ZVNA1JC5	Chris Wood	This DVD is of one of the best quality DVDs to date and well worth the purchase especially with all the extras!  A must get for all who love the film and quality DVD!If a movie like American Beauty can win Best Picture, Gladiator will walk away with it this year. Even though it has been a bad year for quality films, that really wouldn't have made a difference because Gladitor, in my opinion is the best overall film made in decades and it would've taken alot to beat it. Perhaps the business knew this and are waiting until next year to release the better quality stuff.Hats of to Ridley Scott for what will be a long awaited and deserved Oscar for Best Picture and Director. What can I say, it has potential for Best Actor: Russell Crow, Best Supporting Actor: Joachim Phoenix or Richard Harris, Best Actress: Connie Nielsen, Original Score: Zimmerman (that's a guarantee), Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Cinematoraphy and the list goes on. This movie has the potential to win the most oscars of any single film to date because it will grab the special effects awards traditionally given to sci-fi movies.I love this movie and DVD, as you can tell!Chris Wood, Miramichi NB Canada	5.0	Gladiator: Well Made DVD	2000-12-08	8	7	1

If you like epic movies, don't miss this one.The movie is very well made The scenes are well filmed, and though many scenes are very violent, you can tell that the graphic violence has been toned down because this is not the real intent of the film. Rome and the Coliseum are nicely recreated.The movie is 2 hours 30 minutes, and is captivating throughout. I found every bit of dialog to be gripping, interesting, and vital to the story. Though the film is long, I do not see where any bit could be cut. All scenes seem vital to the story.This film worth owning to view again and again.	5.0	Best Epic of Its Time	2002-11-13	0	0	0

If you're a big fan of Epic movies you will NOT be disappointed with this movie. The visuals are stunning and action sequences are awesome. There is actually a love story for the girlfriend and wives to stay glued to the screen. Russel Crowe is outstanding as Maximus, and the supporting cast is very good. The character development could have been deeper, but to squeeze as much as they did already into 3 hours was pretty spectacular. I'm looking forward to watching this movie over and over.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1PXS8YSXR135N	Cindy Collins Smith	There's lots of spectacle here, and a reasonably compelling story dealing with honor, love, and revenge. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as the villain, and certainly deserves his Oscar-nomination.Yet, I must say that when I saw this film last summer, I ate my popcorn, enjoyed the picture, then went home and quickly forgot about it. The film did not linger, and I had no desire to see it again at the theater--possibly because I followed it up with BEN HUR, an infinitely better Roman epic.GLADIATOR is undoubtedly one of the year's best, but if the Oscars are just, it will not beat CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON... which is, quite simply, one of the finest films in the history of world cinema (AND which has far better swordplay).	4.0	Pretty Good, But No BEN HUR	2001-02-25	7	2	5

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A367SHOUJ850W8	cinephile100	Ah &quot;Gladiator.&quot;  What a film.  The execs at Dreamworks said that it was going to be &quot;bigger than Titanic!&quot;  While that was a bit of a stretch, the film was still a big deal.  It brought sandal and sword epics of the fifties and sixties back in a big way.  It made Russel Crowe an overnight success.  It brought Ridley Scott back in a big way.  And it brought big bucks into the box office.&quot;Gladiator&quot; is a really good film.  It's only problem is that &quot;Braveheart&quot; already came out.  It's hard not to draw parallels between the films considering they both revolve around characters who are avenging the deaths of their wives while they fight political persecution in their country.But what &quot;Gladiator&quot; tackles head on that &quot;Braveheart&quot; ignored is the issue of identity, speciffically in Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus.  Here is a great film villain that we almost sympathize with because what makes him tick is so clearly portrayed to the audience.  Phoenix is fantastic in this role, but, then again, it would have taken alot of hard work to mess up a character so well written.Along with a refreshingly original score, beautiful cinematography, a star making performance by Crowe, and amazing battle scenes, Gladiator has become one of the top contenders for Oscar this year.  Does it deserveb the top prize?  No of course not.  The material isn't freh enough.  But its better than alot of other films this year.	4.0	A Solid Film	2001-01-07	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2X8KN82L07RSK	C. Johnson	The plot of this movie had the potential of being a very, bloody, gory, stupid, and meaningless movie if it landed in the wrong hands.  Thankfully that didn't happen and Rob Ridley did nothing less than a spectucular job on this movie.The movie starts with the main character, Maximus leading his troops to victory.  After the war, the king tells Maximus that he would perfer that he become king over his son, when he died.  Of course the King's son, Commodus, did not like that and after the king dies, orders Maximus be killed.  Maximus escapes his assilants, is found, and becomes a slave.  As a slave he is forced to fight as a gladitor, and he eventually fights his way to to appearing in the famous Roman colliseum.  He gains the supports of other slaves and even his master, and he vows revenge on the new king, Commodus.The action scenes in this movie were perfect, nothing was overdone or underdone.  There was alot of blood and violence in this movie, but they were ALWAYS in the right place and fit perfectly in the current scence.  Maximus was not a cold-blodded killer, until he was in the &quot;ring&quot;.  In the ring, his skills, ruthlessness and sometimes arrogance were very pleasing to watch.  He knew that no one could beat him even if it was not a fair fight.  And the creator of Gladiator did an excellent job in getting these facts across without actually coming out and saying it.The acting of this movie was also superb.  The two main charatcters played by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix did spectacular jobs with there roles.  Crowe had a very convincing performance assuming the role of Maximus.  Phoenix also did a very good job in betraying the cowardness of Commodus, and also betraying the flat out &quot;jerk&quot; (since I can't use another word) that he is.This movie shows that there are still people out there that can produce quality action movies.  Alot of action movies these days are rushed and thrown together and bombard the audience with meaningless overdone action scenes where they are not appropriate.  Not the case with Gladiator.  This movie is easily in the top 5 of my all time favorites.  I rarely give 5 stars on a review, and usually when I see a very good movie I give it 4 stars as I would feel much better giving a movie 4 stars when it was actually a 4.5 rather than just giving it a 5.  However I did not want to give gladiator just 4 stars because it is much better than that.  If there was one movie I would feel good about giving 5 stars, then Gladiator is it.	5.0	In one word - EXCELLENT	2001-12-20	2	0	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2G4G46FUBY3VN	Cortez	One has to hand it to Ridley Scott, it took some major balls to make a film like this. And the biggest surprise is that he actually pulled it off. And only Russell Crowe could have played a General turned Gladiator without a hint of vanity. If nothing else, Gladiator is simply a visual masterpiece -- overflowing with grand palaces, spectacular battles, fearsome gladiatorial contests, and a massive re-creation of ancient Rome that only an army of slave laborers or modern computer graphics could achieve. The story, concocted by a team of screenwriters including the literate William Nicholson, is pure potboiler. The great hero Maximus (Russell Crowe) is destroyed by a young, degenerate emperor called Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who slaughters the general's wife and child. Maximus escapes the blade but is enslaved, made a gladiator, and eventually returns to fight in the Roman Colosseum, where he will of course exact revenge on Commodus. The best parts of the script are the wry comments on the nature of &quot;entertainment&quot; and politics, and the way public opinion can be manipulated in either arena. This is a nice sardonic touch, although with millions of dollars on the line, Scott is busy rattling his own sword.Gladiator's literary narrative is perfectly balanced by the strength of its visual style. Whether in squalid pits under the Colosseum or the blazing sun of its magnificently recreated battleground, the burnished light gives every composition a dazzling, painterly quality. Computer-enhanced shots of the virtual Roman landscape are full of detail, from the statuary and columns of the Forum to the retractable velarium sun roof over the freshly minted Colosseum. Ditto the actual interior sets where bedchambers and Imperial throne rooms sparkle with authenticity. There are a few cracks in the film's magnificent faade. John Mathieson's herky-jerky camerawork makes the otherwise masterful opening battle look like Saving Centurion Ryan, and a nonsensical moment where Maximus and Lucilla kiss seems to exist only to spice up the trailer. Scott makes a few other missteps - including too much Commodus/Lucilla dialogue, and failing to make Phoenix as menacing (a la Tim Roth's foppish swordsman in Rob Roy) as the film's final scenes require. But such complaints are mere quibbles. It may bear some flaws and familiar elements, but Gladiator's script is a great story well told, evading the clich&eacute;s one might expect (facing your best friend in the ring, etc.) and staying completely one-liner free. Scott also adds spiritual resonance to Maximus' journey, elevating a simple quest for revenge to a Homeric search for inner peace via surreal dream sequences and subtle motifs. The most affecting symbol is the very first the audience sees - a gauntleted hand gently caressing a wheat field. Though initially inconsequential, by the film's end, this image becomes one of the more haunting in recent memory. Such touches give Gladiator a soul, placing the film in the lower pantheon of cinematic greatness.And not that I place any importance on the Oscars (how could anyone?), but Gladiator, with its epic scope and execution, easily deserves the 'Best Picture' nod over the smug amd self-important 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.	4.0	Vast in scope, grand in vision	2001-03-17	6	3	3
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2VK4CM0THGX3T	Cory Gill	I recieved the movie &quot;Gladiator&quot; for Christmas this year. This is a very good movie but I warn you it does take a few times to really understand and grasp the whole plot and fully appreciate this movie. This movie is full of digital effects, but they are not overused as they are in some movies. The digital effects are perfectly excecuted. The main character &quot;Maximus&quot; is played by Russell Crowe, who in my opinion did a good job of acting out the illustrious personality of Maximus. He did a good job changing the personality of Maximus as he was in different situations. There where points in the movie when Maximus was a reverant man, and other points where he was a cold blooded killer.Joaquin Phoenix, brother of River Phoenix, played the evil Roman emperor Commodus. Joaquin did a good portrayal of the emperor, who is known in the history books to probably have been insane and obsessed with gladatorial sport. He bankrupted the Roman treasury by spending all his money of uneccesary things having to do with sport. Some also say he was the emperor who started the downfall of the Roman Empire. Joaquin did a great job in my opinion, and his portraying of the Commodus was mostly accurate to the history books.Now some naysayers have said it was impossible for the Emperor to have ever fought in the Colosseum. Well, I have researched  the Roman Empire and Commodus often appeared in the Colossuem to fight poorly armed gladiators who had only wooden weapons and no armor, while the Emperor has metal weapons and was well armed. There where many other stipulations in the Emperors favor, and I am sure he would get a little &quot;help&quot; if the battle was not going his way. The real Commodus also appeared in chariot races, but he never raced in the Circus Maximus because he did not like to do it in public.There where a few small plots in this movie that did not conform with history, such as the fact the Marcus Aurelias probably did not have any problem with Commodus becoming the new emperor after he died. However, this is a great movie, and it is well acted and has a great plot. It might not be able to satisfy the regular history buff, but it can satisfy the normal American, which is what has made this such a great film. The directing, the acting, the digital effects, it is all here in this one, so I would reccomend you buy this DVD immediately.	5.0	Great film that will be remembered	2002-01-05	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1YIECLQEMTN3T	count chocula	This movie is simply awesome.  And, it has not come a minute too soon.  The ancient world is FULL of possiblities for stories like this (note, this is historical FICTION, not telling an actual event.)  Great direction, sets, plot, dialogue, and acting.  Oh, there is no &quot;drag in some spots&quot; that some reviewers have commented on.  I guess in this generation no one is allowed to TALK for more than 20 seconds without it being deemed &quot;wordy.&quot;  Also, I noticed two errors in otherwise good reviews below:  1) Commodus did not &quot;listen to his father's advisors&quot; at first - he immediately concluded a shameful peace with the Germans and left to enjoy the debauched pleasures of Rome before his father was hardly cold.  He was one of the very small group of emperors that nothing good can be said.  2)  Rome didn't &quot;fall due to greed and spectator sports&quot; - the Roman Empire basically was mortally wounded by plague that depopulated huge areas of the empire, with the resulting economic and military downturns, and due to pressure from the nomadic barbarians and barbarization of the army.  If the two great epidemics (one during Marcus Aurelius's time) hadn't happened, it is very possible today's major language would be based on Latin.  Anyway, it's a GREAT movie - grab it. One should also check out that wonderful film, &quot;Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; which covers similar ground, but in a very different plotline - another great film, and Will Durant (the historian) was an advisor on it.  And please disregard the numerous bad user reviews of this film, also.  It's a very good movie.	5.0	A grand, much-needed epic !	2000-10-09	8	7	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2OL3MOTRXT7TD	Count Graf Orlok	Overall, Gladiator was a good movie, though it did have it's problems.  For one, it passed itself off as an action flick and turned out to be more or less a drama.  With a title like Gladiator, you'd expect more than 5 good fighting scenes over the course of two and a half hours.  The fight scenes were good, except the camera wouldn't say on one spot long enough.  It was very dizzying and jumpy.  The veiwer got the idea of what happened, but missed out on a lot of detail.  The conversation with his friend about each other's families was just a tad too much foreshadowing for the ending.  The ending was very nicely done, one of the best parts of the movie as he's making his way into the Elysium Fields.  Between fights, it was just a lot of dialouge.  Not unnecessary dialough exactly, but presented in a rather bland manner.  Commodus shouldn't have been written so whiny and cowardly, and Maximus should've showed more of the emotion that was obviously present in him.  A good movie worth seeing, but don't watch it with any prior expectations.	4.0	Good, but not quite what I expected.	2000-12-23	1	0	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"This is a modern take on the Gladiator movie.  A Roman general, Maximus, has loyally served on the German front.  When a new and jealous Caesar, Commodus, ascends the throne, he orders Maximus and his family killed.  Maximus excapes and ends up in a provincial arena as a gladiator slave.  When Commodus decides to have a season of games in the Colliseum, Maximus's troupe travels to Rome and he searches for a way to avenge his family's death.This is a typical story in terms of epic filmaking, and this film is most definitely an epic.  From the Private Ryan-esque battle at the German front (featuring 1000 extras, flaming arrows, and mud!) to the CGI-generated recreation of the Colliseum, it's a treat to watch and soak in the atmosphere.  The performances are uniformly good - Crowe was probably better in the Insider, but won his Oscar here as Maximus.  It's a good thing Crowe can sustain interest, as he's onscreen something like 85% of the time!  The supporting performances are also good.This is a typical Ridley Scott film.  He almost blows it with a couple of (as it turns out) non-fatal errors.  The first is that the entire film (155 minutes!) is on the same level of intensity.  Any mood for 2.5 hours is tough to take, but the oppressive sombreness of Gladiator is particularly dangerous.  However, the gladitorial spectacles are sufficiently diverse to break it up.  More annoying is the uniform drabness of the film.  The colours are completely washed out greys and browns.  This was done to match up the CGI (not quite up to the challenge in 1999), but the overall look is dull!  Oddly, parts of the soundtrack then clash with the visuals because the music is too bright.  The CGI is generally non-obtrusive (except when showing large crowds), so I can forgive this problem as well.The DVD extras are quite nice, especially the hour-long documentary on gladitorial games.  It's no surprise that the ""real"" characters in the film, such as Commodus, are not accurately portrayed, but does lend credence to the general accuracy of the situations - they may not have happened as filmed, but COULD have.  There are cut scenes, the commentary by Scott and others is interesting, so the DVD is well worth getting."	4.0	Oscar worthy?  Probably not, but highly entertaining	2003-02-19	1	1	0

This 3 disc extended edition just made the movie a whole lot better too, with deleted scenes re edited and re cut just for this edition it's a must have for serious moviegoers. Here scenes that weren't fully explained in the original cut have been fixed with an extra 17 minutes of bonus footage.This film has plenty of intense fighting scenes with all the fights being fast, hard-hitting, uncensored, and very bloody, which is what they should've been like. And every single fight sequence is unique from the others. which will please most people, great characters like Crowe and Phoenix, authentic storytelling, believable special effects. This film also stands out in my mind as one of the most visual, image-driven action films I've ever seen. Thanks to Ridley Scott, practically every scene is jammed with wonderful detail and art direction.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1NW8E3D2N40CY	critic no.1	First of all I wanna say, that the set-up of this movie, the cinematography, the special effects and of course the acting of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are just fabulous. I think I never saw a historic epic like this before.  BUT: What's the matter with Hollywood, when it comes to find movie endings? Why does the so-called hero have to die in such a pseudo-ideolistic, melodramatic way, that a whole movie of about two and a half hours has to suffer and become actually nothing more than  a 08/15, 3 star movie just because of the final 15 minutes? These final 15 minutes - without them and another ending, The Gladiator would be a great 5 star movie - of The Gladiator are so full of senseless, completly overdrawn emotions, that you actually can only laugh or leave the theatre. It was exactly the same thing with The Matrix: Love is so great, love is so strong, it can wake the dead(Neo).  In The Gladiator, love, loyality and believe in honour is so strong that, although the hero dies, everything is good, great and beautiful in the end and after we shared a tear or too, because of the unfair way, his life has ended, we know, thta now the hero can be happy with his family in heaven... Oh please! Dear Hollywood, do all of us a favour and stop destroying great movies with &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;wonderful&quot; endings, that let us leave the cinema crying or make us want to scream, because we hve spent 10 bucks for a ticket or 25 bucks for the dvd.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A32IB2RSYSPJ3W	"""crushul"""	I'm going to keep this somewhat short, and sweet.  Gladiator is absolutley brilliant.  Ridley Scott directs this Roman epic, and he enlists the talents of Russell Crowe as the lead character, Maximus, a General in the Roman Army.  Alongside Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix is the Emperor, after his father passes on.  This film grips the viewer and holds them intensely right from the beginning, with a battle scene so fierce it will draw comparisons to the scenes from Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  Right from there the viewer expects sheer brilliance for the rest of the film, and that is exactly what they get.  Crowe's performance in Gladiator is the best performance given by an actor since, once again, Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace in his classic, Braveheart. Crowe's dialogues are just perfect for delivery, tone, volume, everything.  Body actions match precisely to his words, and much is the same for the rest of the characters.  Phoenix, the Emperor, makes you believe that he really is a mean S.O.B, with a real evil look to boot.  Although I'd have to say the best performance given by any actor ever would be Al Pacino as the Great Tony Montana in Scarface.  Now, Scarface is my favorite movie of all time, and after that movie, few have been able to list as classics on my all-time list.  In order (1-5) my favorite movies of all time are: 1.  Scarface, (Al Pacino)  2.  Braveheart,(Mel Gibson) 3.  Gladiator,(Russell Crowe) 4.  Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, 5.  Juice, (Tupac Shakur). To put Gladiator into this position, in my opinion, is a testament to the movie, its makers, and its actors.  So in all, this is the best movie in years, and well worth buying as a permanent fixture in your collections.  Oh, and see if you can spot WWF's The Rock as one of the Gladiators.  Enjoy!	5.0	Brilliant, Masterpiece, Mesmerizing, etc.	2001-05-21	4	1	3
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A36SZI12JHB5ZY	"CRV ""CRV"""	Lets start off with the historical misrepresentations.1. Maximus never existed.2. Marcus Aurelius never intended to make one of his generals emperor. Rather, a general proclaimed himself emperor once hearing news that Marcus Aurelius died however, his troops executed him shortly after for making that absurd proclaimation.3. Commodus was not killed in a gladatorial battle in the Collesseum. He was executed by a wrestler that he was training with at home.4. Rome was not returned to a republic after Commodus's death but, a successor was appointed.The historical inaccuracies here are mindboggling furthermore, infusing fictional characters during history may be acceptable for artistic lisence purposes however, changing the outcome of historical events cannot be justified since thats considered rewriting history which is what happened in this film.  Most people like myself were not aware of the detailed history of Rome therefore we assumed that the characters and events that this movie portrayed were factual to an extent, However that wasnt the case and I personally felt intellectually cheated  for being mislead in that way. this movie did present some factual events such as of Commodus killing his father (although that is mostly speculation since historical records do not clearly indicate how Marcus Aurellius died), Commodus ruling as emperor of rome, COmmodus performing as a gladiator in the collesseum although he fought against gladiators forced to use wooden sticks while he used lethal weapons. Thats why he always won. Commodus also ruled rome for 12 years unlike this movies portrayal of a 2-3 year period.As much of a Sacrilege to history this movie presented, the plot is nevertheless compelling and the visuals are extraordinary. Russell Crow was believable as a fierce gladiator with a moral a conscience outside the arena.In conclusion, Ridley Scott basically patched some facts together and made a fictional story. It appears maximus's character was inspired by the  true history of  Spartacus's rebellion against Rome. THe Parallels are apparent by Maximus and Spartacus rallying gladiators of different cultures and languages to overcome  the Roman challenges however, The Irony is that true history of Spartacus's rebellion is more grand and more inspiring since he reallied thousands of people (not a mere 20 like Maximus) to defeat thousands of highly trained roman legions  9 consecutive times in open war battles (not in a staged arena such is what Maximus did). Spartacus amazingly kept up this rebellion for a period of 2 years until he was finally outnumbered by 3 roman legions.	4.0	Great Movie, even if it is fiction.	2005-09-12	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ACIDYO5BU0N40	Curiosity #3	How about this: General Maximus has just concluded the last significant campaign the Roman Empire will fight for a long while, succesfully. His men adore him, and so does the Roman populace. He is a hero, and at least out there in the field he should be untouchable. On the eve of his victory, Emperor Marcus Aurelius, out to supervise the campaign in Germany himself, is murdered by his own son (for obvious reasons), and Maximus notices that. Instead of launching an investigation, he, the victorious general, at the orders of the emperor's son, is abducted by the very soliders who adore him, for an attempt to assasinate him. He escapes, and travels back to Italy to protect his wife and children from the new Emperor's wolves. He finds them crucified (after a journey thru lands that do not exist anywhere between Germany and Italy) at his own estate. Now, no soldiers have been waiting to intercept him there (which would have been the obvious thing to do) and he feels free to collapse from despair and faints (or takes a nap). A slave trader who happens to pass by picks him up right there while he is still in coma, and without interference from the authorities, abducts him to Africa. Note that this happens in central Italy, right in the heartland of the Roman Empire (for Christ's sake!)Does any of this strike you as odd?The plot goes on in this manner. Some people have critized the historical inaccuracy of this film, and that may be as it will. But the plot in its own inherent (il)logic is already so bad that worrying about historical facts is vain. The plot is so bad that despite spectacular fights and CGI-type reconstructions of old Rome, I was tempted to switch off. This film is a disgrace, and an insult. How stupid do you think your audience is, Mr. Ridley? With a gigantic Hollywood budget at hand, you had a chance to resurrect old Rome in all its glory, and offer a satisfying and plausible story along with it. You have completely wasted that chance.For those still considering watching it, here is my recommendation: do so at your own peril, and only if all you care about is action and - admittedly - breathtaking reconstructions of the eternal city. Otherwise you will end up one upset ticket-buyer.	1.0	A lost chance	2001-01-16	42	10	32

Essentially it's the same kind of plot as Braveheart, but set in the Roman Empire.  While it is visually and musically stunning, the movie is extremely brutal.  It's major flaw was the weakness of the plot and the lack of character development of some of the players, despite some great acting.  It's worth renting, particularly if you have a really large screen tv, but I don't think that your collection will be lacking if you leave this off of your buy list.

If you don't know, yet,Russell Crowe and don't remember how fabulous were Richard Harris and late Oliver Reed, it's definitly the film to start with for next Xmas.	5.0	maximum DVD	2000-10-26	1	0	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A8F5TT280TXFB	DaGuy	This is an excellent movie with great acting, a well thought out plot, and a beautiful score (Hans Zimmer &amp; Lisa Gerrard). Before I saw it, I assumed it would be just another typical 'fighting' movie, but it is actually much more in depth. I was very surprised. This is also an excellent DVD package - there's a whole separate disc just for the bonus materials, which include director commentary, deleted scenes, an interview with the composer, a photo gallery, cast member bios, etc. Considering that you can get other DVDs without any of these extra features for the same price, the $23 price tag is well worth it.	5.0	Great Movie	2001-02-21	3	2	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3CP2GCS845HWE	D. Alanguilan	I love this movie, and I can almost love this DVD. The 200+minute documentary is amazingly in-depth in many aspects of the film, but is astonishingly deficient in one significant area: CASTING. Features on weapons, costumes, the conception and writing, visual effects are all extraordinarily in-depth on the level of the LOTR EEs, but with the exception of Oliver Reed (who unfortunately passed away during the filming), hardly anything else is mentioned about how the movie was cast. There was hardly or no mention at all about how major actors Russell Crowe, Richard Harris or Joaquin Phoenix were approached about doing this movie, and why they were chosen. In fact, there is no section of this documentary focusing on actors at all (again, except for Oliver Reed).  I think some details were mentioned here and there in the commentary, but it's absence from the main documentary is rather puzzling. It leaves a rather large void in what would have been one of the best documentaries on DVDs I've seen.	4.0	Gladiator (Extended Edition)	2005-09-01	8	7	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	After looking at all my reviews I realized that this review does the film no justice and I just emphasize my fasination with anything Russell Crowe so I've decided to rewrite my review if in hopes to help a few appreciate a great and wonderful film.My original review:First of all I decided to write my review for Gladiator today and I pulled it up and now I just have to say I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ARE RELEASING AN EXTENDED VERSION TO THIS MOVIE!!!  Now that I said all that...This movie introduced me to Russell Crowe.  I've been hooked ever since.  My wife says I'm obsesive, but who can blame me.  In this film Russell glows, he reaks of star, he oozes forward with OSCAR written all over him...Yes, there are other films that Russell owned, like A Beautiful Mind and the recent Cinderella Man, but this is what really got him noticed.  The story here is quite good for an action film, considering most action films lack (there are a few exceptions, like Armegedon & The Matrix for example)  There is pure emotion portrayed here by the entire cast, but notibly moreso in Crowe and Phoenix...The movie is quite gory, but please don't let that hinder you from watching this film...Ridley Scott brilliantly placed this film together and made one of the best films I've ever seen.  The battle's and fights are amazing and very well put together...everything about this film is eye catching.  I would recommend to anyone.  You won't be dissapointed.And now, my new review:Maximus (Crowe) is a loyal general of the Roman army, a man devoted to serving his country, a man who left behind his loved ones to serve the Emperor Marcus Arelious (I know I butchered the spelling)...theres just one problem and that problem is the Emperor's some Comodus (Phoenix) who wants rulership after his fathers death, and since his father is unwilling to do so, wanting the Roman empire to fall back to the ways of the Senate, Comodus murders his father in order to attain rule.  After doing so he has Maximus taken out to be exicuted.  Maximus of course escapes and upon returning home finds his wife and son have been murdered.  The week and tired soilder then collapses and is found by traveling merchants as sold as a gladiator to fight in the Roman games Comodus has decided to throw in rememberence of his late father.  Here is Maximus's chance for vengence, and vengence he will have.  The film is spot on with a tight script and impressive acting on all fronts, a film that delivers solid action with an emotinal sucker punch.  Much praise for Crowe who gives us a look at an amazingly strong man, one who can rise above what he's been redused to in order to free himself from the pain.  Amazing and powerful film!	5.0	OMG (reissued)	2005-06-01	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2U22M4AXDZDYU	Dan Balogh	When Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) admits to favoring the general Maximus (Russell Crowe) as his successor, instead of his dishonest son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Commodus takes steps to ensure that his father's wishes are never realized, to the detriment of Aurelius, Maximus, their families and to Rome herself.This beautifully executed, gorgeously photographed and wonderfully acted film is also (unfortunately) almost totally unoriginal. Avid filmgoers have already seen this again and again, even down to the tiresome clich&eacute;s like the perplexing convention that all nefarious despots seem be a tad effeminate. There will be few surprises for those who have seen such films as the two versions of Ben-Hur (1926, 1959), The Robe (1953), Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954) and Spartacus (1960), not to mention Anthony Mann's equally sprawling The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) of which this is very close to being a remake.Ridley Scott makes it all palatable to modern audiences who have come to expect large doses of snazzy computer graphics and frenetic action scenes (with the concomitant sprinklings of realistic gore). Here Scott brilliantly employs the &quot;strobe effect&quot; photography which Spielberg put to good use recently in his Saving Private Ryan. Alas, some of these scenes are completely over-the-top, with Crowe easily disposing of five or six heavily armed opponents without even breaking a sweat -- glaring incongruities, and often unintentionally laughable, in an otherwise beautifully detailed and painstakingly accurate treatment.If you haven't seen the aforementioned films, this film may delight you from beginning to end. If you have seen those films, there is still lots here to recommend this film, though don't expect any surprises.	3.0	Yes, but we've seen this all before.	2000-12-29	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1R8AO9XASQ15C	Daniel A. Marsh	"""Gladiator"" is an astonishing success -- and by that I mean that I am astonished by the level of success this mediocre flick has attained.Why are people so enamored of this film? Why was it even made? Clearly spurred on by the fortunes of the ultra-realistic ""Saving Private Ryan"" (which is infinitely better than this movie), ""Gladiator"" is a long, dull, boring slog through action sequences we've seen before in other, better movies.The obvious CGI is ugly, the photography dank and dark, the script ridden with cliches and the performances as stiff as nails -- including the lead performance of Russell Crowe, who is about as dour, joyless and inert as any actor I've ever seen in any movie. Mel Gibson played a similar character in ""Braveheart"" (lone man takes on the aristocracy to avenge the death of his wife), but with much more verve and energy than Crowe musters here. Crowe is a complete flop in this movie.But, people love it. It won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (over ""Traffic"" and ""Crouching Tiger""!).

Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life, and no one can come to the heavenly Father but by Him; therefore, He is the only way by which anyone can see eternal life in heaven after this life.	2.0	Realistic revenge but unwelcome imposed belief system	2013-12-26	14	0	14
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3KO1QOAMYHWY4	Daniel B. Hitchman	"Universal Home Video was responsible for this horrible contribution to the much lauded, premium ""Sapphire Series"" for Paramount's Blu-ray division.  According to Bill Hunt at The Digital Bits, they more than likely used an HD master from way back in 2000 for all theatrical footage and a newer HD transfer from 2005 for the extended scenes.Therefore, the 2005 material looks pretty good, though not as good as the best modern HD telecine work and definitely not as good as Braveheart (it received a fairly recent HD transfer), with no trace of Edge Enhancement and only minor Digital Noise Reduction applied.  In comparison, the 2000 transfer for the bulk of the film is a completely waxy, smeared mess devoid of fine detail with EE up the wazoo.Hopefully, pressure can be brought to bear towards Paramount and Universal and they will re-release this modern-day masterpiece with a brand new HD transfer devoid of all the various problems presented here, and issue an exchange as Sony did with The Fifth Element.You have been warned!  Avoid Gladiator at all costs and instead spend your money on Braveheart on Blu-ray instead.  Of the two, it's the only ""Sapphire"" title worthy of its name."	1.0	Buy Braveheart on Blu-ray, it's stunning, but skip this stinker!	2009-08-30	59	50	9

This movie is simply magnificent and just mind catching it is just spectacular. The movie begins with a character known as Maxiums the commander of the Roman army and the evil emperor Commudus. He sends for the death of Maximums, which he then escapes and wonders on to the dersert and is sold to a man who trains gladiator. Later on he becomes a gladiator and fights and is seen by all, that he is a skilled fighter and earns the respect of the people and his fellow fighters. Then he confrunted by a conflict that changes his view in life, he sees his wife and child hung and burned to death and his house destroyed.He is then confronted by the emperor and is challenged to a fight to the death. No one Konws that he was sopose to be the emperor but Lucilla the sister of Commdus. Later on he is confronted by him and is staved underneath his ribs, but he succeeds on killing the evil emperor but dies as well.He is then carried out of the area by his fellow fighters and friends and his death turns him into a Colisiom star and that is why I give the gladiator a five star rating and is a breathtaking and is a must see and own movie.	5.0	The Brave Hearted Gladiator.	2004-09-21	3	2	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3KOVFORKXQ2U9	Daniel McInnis	As I'm writing this Gladiator's nominated for twelve Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and already critics are crying foul.  This from a movie that upon it's May release opened to three and four star reviews across the board (or at least for the most part anyway).  I assume the reasoning behind this is that a movie with such commerical appeal can't possibily be the best picture of the year.  And while I favor Traffic to walk away with the top prize, Gladiator would be a more than worthy recipient.*  It would be especially refreshing given the Miramax stranglehold that's pushed such mediocre films as The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love to Oscar status.  I'm not saying this movie's not without it's faults, just that in the context of an epic of this size they're so miniscule that they seem almost nonexistent.Russell Crowe, fresh off his career best performance in The Isider, stars as Maximus, a Roman general whose influence over his men threatens the ascension to the throne of emperor-in-waiting, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).  So Commodus does the natural thing, in Roman times anyway, killing his father and sending Maximus out to pasture to be killed as well.  But Maximus escapes death only to discover his family slain and himself confound to slavery.  After his capture he's sold to an ex-gladiator in search of fresh meat to be wrung through the proverbial shredder.  And upon their intial battle Maximus, known as &quot;The Spaniard&quot; to his fellow slaves, shows that he has some life.  He and a handful of others scathe off death merely to find themselves fighting for their lives once again, this time in front of a blood thirsty crowd at the Roman Coliseum.Motivating him is the opportunity to stand in front of the emperor and claim vengeance in his family's name.  Standing in his way ia an ex-flame (Connie Nielsen) who also happens to be the emperor's sister.  She persuades him to use his celebrity (as gladiator's were in those days) to attempt to root out the corruption in the Senate and turn the reins of power back over to the people in the form of a Republic.  Grand aspirations for a general turned slave turned gladiator, but Crowe's magnetic, larger-than-life performance sells us on the plausibility.It's true, this is a sword and scandal picture and it's violent themes are undeniable but to liken it to the World Wrestling Federation (as one particularly highly regarded critic did) is asinine.  It's story is just as strong as it's action, which is at times so dizzying that it seems more graphic than it actually is.  The characters are strong, independent and propel the plot.  This is not a popcorn flick or a guilty pleasure that you should feel embarrassed for liking.  It's a profound film with subtle, meaningful messages that can at times be overlooked because of all the eye-candy congesting the screen.This is a recurring theme for Ridley Scott, whose film credits include Alien and Hannibal.  But in Gladiator he's found his most mature material to date and, besides, it's kind of hard to hold that against him when you see the grandeur of the world in which he's created, and in which we inhabit for it's two and a half hour running time.Still, despite it's length, it breezes by faster than many of the ninety minute dogs we've been subjected to over the summer of 2000.  Now admittedly it was a bad year for movies, but that's not to suggest Gladiator wins by default.  It's a superlative achievement and I'm sure it would have been recognized as such in any year, no matter how competitive.I can only hope that this is a start of a promising trend in Hollywood, a substance-based summer blockbuster that can connect with it's audience without having to skimp on the plot.* since recanted, see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon	5.0	Gladiator  Slays  It's  Critics	2001-02-26	12	9	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2GYX971VETQBV	Daniel R. Sanderman	"""Gladiator"" has many ups and downs.  In many ways, I agree with some reviewers who describe the plot as thin and lacking real substance.  While the story does follow a mock Shakespearian line, the film is really not that surprising and I was not awed by the acting performances in this film, save Crowe.  ""Braveheart,"" a similar film, had a little more to offer as far as a turbulent plot is concerned, but let's face it-it's the same kind of movie.  We are not dealing with a movie that is supposed to achieve greatness through its clever dialogue and wit.  This film is an entertaining visual splash that I believe succeeds quite splendidly.  If you love action films, the wonderfully choreographed combat scenes that star Crowe and his Roman short sword are spectacular.Joaquin Phoenix just annoyed me in this film-plain and simple.  So, in part, you could say that he was doing his job.  But he was a bit over-the-top in his bad Shakespearian rendition of Commodus and I just wanted him to get off the screen whenever the camera fell upon him.  Instead of creating an interesting villain, Phoenix created another stock ""woe's me"" character.  Crowe's performance, on the other hand, is quite good-particularly for the amount of lines that he has to prove himself.  The scenes that show Rome at its height are impressive and I enjoyed the transformed time period of this film.""Gladiator"" is a summer blockbuster that is a fun film, a movie that can be watched over and over again.  Despite its surface-deep dialogue and lousy attempt to pull-off a psychologically driven, Shakespearian plot, it manages to lay out one of the more enriching action films of recent years."	4.0	Great Visual Splash &amp; Bad Shakespeare	2003-12-26	3	2	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3BJHQSDEPOPTJ	Dan Reef	The recent dramatic epic &quot;Gladiator&quot; has already won two golden globe awards for it's stellar impact on the public. The idea of the plot seems to be an age-old one: a rags to riches biographical look at an innocent civilian who wakes up every day feeling very grateful to have that day. Named Maximus, he is nothing but one of the hundred slaves being held captive in a dome in Rome, forced to face bloodthirsty ravenous beasts topped off by tyrants swinging massive, sharp &quot;spikeballs&quot;(?), with only a common, everyday sword and shield supplied to him for protection.Russell Crowe's character, Maximus, fully understands the danger that he is facing, but the stage isn't set for the product of what a warrior Maximus was. His appearance was a very quiet and unrelinquished one, he wasn't the sort of fighter who would talk and then try to walk, contrary to all of the other individuals who were faced with the same dangerous predicament and were killed off within an instant. He was afraid; he just didn't show it because, unlike other slaves, he knew that it did no help to show he was afraid. It was one man for himself; it was not a team effort. For this reason, Maximus not only was a physical gladiator, but he was a rare mental genius. This wasn't technically addressed in the movie: that he used brainpower to pull himself through what he did and not just reaction. Maximus soon gave himself an appearance that distinguished him from others after defeating some ten humans and several large cats. Once this happened and he was in the spotlight, he did not want to be any more well-known than he already was. Even when the emperor demanded that he identify himself, he hesitated.Because of this, a tension builds between the emperor and Maximus, the fans beginning to favor Maximus' side more than the emperors for a change and even more emotion is thrown onto the shoulders of Russell Crowe. As he battles and battles for his life, no one is able to stop him and he becomes what Doug Weight is to professional hockey: feared and respected. Eventually, the emperor himself decides that he has had enough with Maximus and he decides to battle him to the death in a gripping and close fought dual.Russell Crowe's performance seemed to be very &quot;Oscar-worthy&quot;, showing a significant amount of emotion and feeling in his role as the gladiator that overcame all odds that were set against him. The battles in the movie settled out to be very intricate, where one mistake could and usually did cost you your life. In the dome, where lions were an added element, it was particularly entertaining to see them come out of compartments that had to have been activated by a warrior. The lions came at everyone like a shark in a puddle of blood. With the acting job done by Russell, it is a believable story, but it really could only ever happen once.It went more in-depth with the weapons than it did with the gore, thankfully (not to imply that there is no gore at all). From the catapults to the flaming arrows to the lion contraptions. The transition of the time periods was just exceptional, bringing back the time period just as it was said to be. &quot;Gladiator&quot; really grabs you and pulls you in, and makes the unbelievable a reality.	4.0	&quot;The Battles of Maximus&quot;	2001-01-26	2	1	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1NQ7YWE33KY2Y	Dan Russell	The plot is original in most respects although it is not for the faint of heart.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone as the casting was excellent and the scenery was extremely well designed and chosen.  The movie was very well shot.  There are only three things that are still bothering me. The first is when Maximus (Russell Crowe) is being brought to the slave market, I thought that the floating effect that they do goes on a bit too long and does not serve any greater purpose.  The second is at the end they showed the compputer generated view of Ancient Rome. That &quot;shot&quot; has always bothered me.  I felt that it is not needed and is not relavent to the story they told.  The story is of the Gladiator and his perils not about Rome at all, other than the fact that it takes place there.  The third thing is in the the final battle Maximus is wounded before hand and with a woulnd like he had he would have been much less alert than he was. I understand that they want to show his perserverance but it is not realistic at all.  Overall the movie was execellent.	3.0	MAGNIFICENTLY DONE IN ALL REGUARDS	2000-10-03	1	0	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2HII4U9WQ0XUV	"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep"""	"Here's a recipe for a bad career move if you're Roman General Maximus:1)Start off your morning by opening up a can of old-fashioned Imperial Roman whup-a** on some barbarian hordes;2)Top off your understandably impressive win with a victory dance around the battlefield on your warhorse(accompanied by war-dogs, no less), culminating in a little tete-a-tete in the tent of the Big Enchilada himself, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (a dying man played, appropriately, by another dying man, Richard Harris);3) Get outmaneuvered by scheming daddy's boy and heir to the Empire Commodus (the mostly insufferably smarmy Joaquin Phoenix), who does a little downsizing: throttling the Emperor and demoting you from General of the Roman Legions to, ah, Dead Guy. You and your family too.So that's pretty much ""Gladiator"": equal parts saucy historical epic and revenge flick, ""Kill Bill"" with a toga and a gladius instead of shades and a katana.It's the sort of soaring, riveting, exotic concoction Hollywood was born to do: use classical history as grandpa's attic, ransack it, gussy it up, inject gobbets of gore and glory and a huge dose of trashiness into it, and in the end just dump the entire audience down the chute into the steaming, sandy vortex of a Roman gladiatorial pit. We who are about to die, Salute You!""Gladiator"" is basically just 1964's epic ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" with a fresh coat of paint and some nifty CGI-tigers, and with all the eye-glazingly dull diplomatic blather cut out (because let's face it: who in their right mind goes to these things to watch old dudes in skirts babble on about how they'll take over Lutullus? Not *this* centurion!).Come to think of it, that flick featured the same characters (Marcus Aurelius, love-interest Lucilla, a wicked Commodus, even a disgraced general Livius) agonizing over the same conflict: Emperor kicks off, bad boy Commodus takes over, hero and villain go mano a mano in the arena at the end. Hmmm---maybe somebody should call their lawyers...At any rate, this version looks gorgeous, and is there anything---anything, I ask you?---that is as glorious as pumping up the volume on the big arena fight until you can rock the rafters of the house two counties over?Everything is quick, deadly, stylish, and tantalizingly rustic: all the high style (courtesy of Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathiesen, with a martial, exotic score mustered up by Hans Zimmer) cloaks the fact that ""Gladiator"" pretty much boils down to two brilliantly-staged fight scenes strung together by about 100 minutes of tedium.Russell Crow broods and glowers, and the flick is ninety shades of electric when he's at the center of it. Richard Harris does his patented ""Old King in Winter"" thing charmingly for his five minutes of screen time; Phoenix spins his sword and appears, mostly, painfully constipated; veteran character actor David Hemmings scarifies with his eyebrows; Oliver Reed works it as Proximo; Connie Nielsen (Lucilla, and yep, that was the Sophia Loren's name in ""Fall of the Roman Empire""...hmmm) manages to be shockingly, mouth-wateringly beautiful in a scant role.But ""Gladiator"" isn't about that. It's about the spectacle at the dark, rotten heart of the Ancient World: about the Colosseum filled with the bellowing of ten thousand throats, filled to bursting with bloodlust and giddiness, about blood and sweat and steel and fear on the sand-covered surface of an arena of death two thousand years ago. In that regard, ""Gladiator"" succeeds wildly.Are you not entertained?JSG"	5.0	Rome didn't Fall---it was Pushed.	2005-06-02	8	5	3

It is a well thought-out action movie (yes, it really is technically an action movie, as one would say Fugitive is an action movie) with great acting (particularly from Jaoquin Pheonix), add an honor theme, great scenes, and a thrilling plot, and you get a movie that feels like an epic and is a wee bit more than  an &quot;action movie.&quot;  As I'd say, and lots of Hong Kong movies realize this, action shouldn't feel like action more than an extension of character, which I think works here.  Movie sure seem to know how to make the Maximus character seem heroic. As for the DVD itself, I'd have to say this is a very excellently composed DVD.  It has lots of great extras such as extra videos and interviews and storyboards.  The audio and video quality is quite excellent.  One of those rare DVDs where I felt I got more cool stuff than I paid for. ^^	5.0	Great DVD ^^	2001-03-05	3	1	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A27FR2C67JPDRS	Daryl B	"If you are looking for an epic film with a great actor, beautiful direction and gorgeous cinematography, this movie by Ridley Scott is for you. Russell Crowe's performance is worthy of the Oscar he received as the honorable general Maximus, who is betrayed by the scheming and evil, Commodus, son of the dead emperor of Rome, played perfectly by Joaquin Phoenix. Scott takes us from the low point of Maximus' existence in slavery and shows us how he battles his way back to confront the man who took his family and life away from him. Through honor, his strength brings him the respect of the citizens of Rome, who eagerly watch the bloody sport in which he is forced to participate. Connie Nielson is also good as the sister of Commodus, and former love of Maximus, who has to deal with the incestuous advances of her brother and his maniacal treatment of the citizens of Rome. This 2 disc dvd contains the movie as well as lots of interesting extras such as ""The Making of Gladiator for HBO"" and tons of deleted scenes. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who loves movies."	5.0	An Incredible Film	2002-02-09	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2XMBWQL0LGNJD	Dave Cordes	"Having just watched it, the reports of Gladiator's travesty on blu-ray seem to have been somewhat exaggerated by a mob of detractors befitting of the Roman Coliseum.  I can certainly acknowledge that it does indeed exhibit very noticeable edge enhancement causing shimmering images and flickering most noticeably on objects such as chainmail and other accoutrements and the opening titles suffer most of all from heavy color banding and solarizing the result of the DNR post-processing.  However the (blu-ray) sky isn't falling and claims of ""vanishing arrows"" and spears ""disappearing"" in mid-air seem to have been blown out of proportion and I had no problem at all seeing them on my 46"" LCD.  There is no doubt that the picture quality could have been improved, and for the debut of Paramount's so-called ""Sapphire Series"" this presentation is something of an embarrassment for the studio and its reputation for future releases under this banner seems questionable, but the detail and clarity of resolution are better than watching the upscaled DVD copy.  The extras are insightful and the sound is nothing short of spectacular.  Still, I did not let these moderate technical flaws detract from the overall enjoyment of the spectacle of the film itself.As Maximus would say, ""Are you not entertained?!?!?""*spits*"	3.0	Are you not entertained?!?!?!	2009-09-04	15	9	6

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A9JFPRE7CH3AF	Dave Kline	"Gladiator has always been one of my favorite movies.  I was excited when it was first released to blu-ray, but was disappointed to see many reviews saying that it was poorly mastered.  With the news that it had been remastered and the quality was great, I thought I'd take a chance and order it from Amazon.  When I received it I was a bit worried...mine had the white UPC and the [...] rebate that expired in June of last year on the cover.  Upon closer inspection, I found that the words ""2 Disc Set"" did not appear above the Paramount logo on the back, right-hand side of the case which has been a reliable indicator of the remastered version.  I opened it, and compared the number on the back, inner-ring of the disc to the confirmed number that Paramount has you check for the exchange program, and it matched!  I hope that Amazon is only selling the remastered version at this point.  I can finally retire my DVD copy of Gladiator.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3P9XLP2NS5NG9	David Aeschliman	The scenery and sets were magnificent ... The Coliseum and Forum, as related to their original models, were extremely well done.In checking my historical references, some historical facts and people were not correct though ....  Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, born in 161, was emperor from 177-192 (15 years, becoming emperor when he was 16 years old - not reflected at all in the movie).  According to the texts, Commodus accompanied his father on the German campaigns and shared in the triumphs and victories.  After becoming emperor, he fancied himself as Hercules, even depicting him as Hercules on many of his coins, and frequently joined gladiatorial fights in the Coliseum.  He eventually became a megalomaniac and considered himself the reincarnation of the god Hercules.  He was actually assassinated on the night of Dec. 31, 192, by the Praetorian Prefect Laetus.  Upon his death, the Senate selected Pertinax as the next emperor, since the Aurelian dynasty was at an end.  The return of the Republic was never contemplated.  Annia Lucilla was actually one of the 13 children, of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger, and the sister of Commodus.  She was born in 149 and married to co-emperor Lucius Verus in 164.  After Verus death, she was re-married to a senator, Pompeianus.  My texts don't mention any children.  In 182, 10 years before Commodus death, she was implicated in a plot against Commodus and exiled to the island of Capri, where she was soon executed.  The movie never introduces and doesn't mention Bruttia Crispina, the wife of Commodus.  She was married to Commodus in 177, and was exiled the same as Lucilla, in 182.  She was executed in 183, nine years before Commodus' death.  It was a touching story and a good performance by the leading actor -- maybe he WILL get an OSCAR, but to a historian, the story is was a little confusing.  I guess if I went back and reviewed &quot;The Robe&quot;, &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, &quot;Ben Hur&quot; etc., I would probably notice the same historical irregularities though.I enjoyed the movie and would give it 4 stars for entertainment, performances and sets.	4.0	Scenery / Sets were magnificient.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"Let's start by saying that ""Gladiator"" is the first great film of the new millenium and maybe the best film of the decade, so far, period.  There are not enough superlatives to describe how great this film is.  Kudos all around to director Ridley Scott, his superb technicians, and the excellent ensemble cast lead by the break-out actor of the new century, Russell Crowe.  This film has passion, it has spectacle.  It is simply breathtaking.  ""Gladiator"" is a throwback to the epics that were made years ago before the costs made them prohibitive.  Thanks to CGI, the illusion of being in the Arena in ancient Rome was made possible.  What makes these effects more special is that similar technologies were utilized to evoke the classical period for the so-so ""Troy"" and the lousy ""Alexander"".  CGI is okay but you have to have a decent movie, as ""Gladiator"" proved.  In this film the effects are in the service of a great story and some great acting.  Enough has been said about how good Russell Crowe is as Maximus, the Roman general left for dead who re-emerges in the Arena as the people's champion.  He won the Oscar for it after all.  Let's go down the list of all the great performances in this film:  Richard Harris, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen, David Hemmings, Dijmon Hounsou.  Last, but not least, I'd like to cite Oliver Reed as Proximo, the world-weary exhibitor.  Reed was a great character actor whose life was unfortunately cut short by his taste for high-living.  This film is a fitting epitaph for his career.  Though this DVD package is some four years old it's still one of the more impressive on the market.  It contains some good extra material on the technical attributes of the film as well as an extraordinary documentary about the real-life gladiators of ancient times."	5.0	Mad Maximus	2004-12-09	2	2	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A14DDIGI6760D4	David Bumba	Without the incredible fight scenes, this movie would be nothing.  The movie simply took too much time to develop a rather unoriginal story (the entire plot is essentially told in the trailer).  The good points; I did find the combat scenes to be nothing less than spectacular, and Russell Crowe does an exceptional acting performance despite a weak supporting cast (the only expection being Joaquin Phoenix, who played the role of Commodus).  As the special features go, the making of and historical information have a few cool facts, but have little replay value, and deleted scenes are nothing more than talking. Overall, I would recommend at least watching it.  It's not the blockbuster in makes itself out to be.	3.0	Expected more	2001-06-22	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AJQ0TIVE5ZK98	David D. Thiel	Ridley Scott's made TV commercials before feature films.  I never saw that style in his films (Alien, Blade Runner) before.  In commercials there is not time to develop an idea so commercial makers get you aroused with style rather than substance.  So it is with Gladiator.  The fight scenes are exciting but meaningless.  I couldn't really tell what was going on but it was exciting.  Some of the transitions reminded me of a car ad.  The dialog was not good.  There was no economy in developing the characters so the movie is 20 minutes too long.  If you want to see a great spectacle then rent Ben Hur.	2.0	I can't begin to tell you how dissapointing Gladiator was	2000-09-25	9	3	6
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A30SQ9E4AU4975	David Durbin	It is most sad that so many people wasted their time on such a vapid film. They tried very hard to make it seem &quot;deep&quot; through the use of dream imagery and excessive computer whizzery. It was impossible to ignore the phonyness, particulary in the coliseum battles with tigers and the giant in the gold mask. It was way too obvious that extreme closeups, swirling camera movement, and overly zealous Foley(sound) effects were intended to disguise the truth, which was that nothing real was happening.As for Russell Crowe, I am still waiting to find out whether he can act. In this film, his mutterings tapped into all the emotions he could express from A to B. Perhaps with a script, he might do better. Maybe when I see &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, I'll find out.I have always been a fan of action films, but this one, alas, was so contrived and obvious in it's use of two-bit trickery that no matter how hard I tried, it was impossible to believe in.If an audience doesn't require more than this film delivers, then how long will it be before movie-goers just salivate and shout their approval just because a film was overhyped to the maximum extent possible.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2YE5FAB8BHR82	"Davide Bianchini ""Rising Suns"""	"I remember first watching this movie in the theaters, and in the final scene, a man in the audience stands up, begins to utter a few expletives, and storms out of the theater. It was then that I realized how affective movies can be; for the good and the bad alike. Those who deny the afterlife will likely feel uneasy watching this movie in particular. And those who believe in the afterlife will likewise feel uneasy, watching the gradual destruction of a soul (the emperor's).What is most striking, is how good and evil are seemingly enfleshed into the two main characters, portraying one's descent into darkness, and the others ascent to glory. The former possessed all the riches of the world, and the latter possessed nothing--humbled to a slave--and yet was in the end glorified while the other forgotten. The parallels to the spiritual life are evident, notwithstanding the extreme violence.**NOTE: There is a deleted scene in the DVD extras of Maximus witnessing Christians being fed to the lions in the Colosseum--something which historically occurred under the reign of emperor Marcus Aurelius (as well as numerous other emperors). As shown in the scene, the Christians would kneel down to pray and sing psalms while awaiting their slaughter. Go to google and type in ""The Christian Martyr's Last Prayer"" to see an accurate painting of this, with the priest intoning the psalms surrounded by Christians in prayer.***"	5.0	great movie...notwithstanding the violence	2012-05-30	8	2	6
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1I25F9S8ZR6ET	David	If you are interested in movies about the ancient world, this is a sure bet to grab your interest from beginning to end. The story is engaging, while the acting throughout is as superb as the film is graphically violent. This film truly brings ancient Rome to life, and while there is much violence, the few peaceful scenes are quite powerful in their own right. This landmark 2 set-DVD truly represents the full potential of the DVD medium, leaving most of the competition in the dust. There are numerous extras which are a treasure chest of information and insight to anyone interested in the making of Gladiator. The sound and visuals are the best I have ever heard or seen on any DVD that I own. I only wish that all the films on DVD displayed half the quality of this one--too many of them are little more than a video tape on disc. Not so with Gladiator; if you don't own this one yet, buy it, if only to see what DVD technology is fully capable of doing.	5.0	A Landmark DVD	2001-09-23	0	0	0

From beginging to end the director never lost the guiding principle behind the Russel Crowes characters motives.  As it was in the begining as it was in the end the motivation for all his actions and decisions remained the same, they did not get lost within layers and layers of useless conotations and sub-plots...like most movies today which try and be &quot;deep&quot; and filled with meaning; however, far to often they choke on their own bad writing and unbelievability.

DreamWorks has outdone themselves again. Not only do you get Dolby Digital, but you also get DTS on the same disc! In the past everyone has said that &quot;You can't put both on the same disc! There'll be no room for any extras!&quot; And they would be right. So DreamWorks piled all the extras, and there are a lot of them, onto a second disc, in an innovative package that is the same size as a single disc box.The extras disc is packed! Deleted scenes, storyboards, a making-of documentary, some gladiator history, a feature on the score, stills, a &quot;diary&quot; written by the young actor who plays Lucius, and much, much more!All I can say is that if you've made it this far, you will love this movie!	5.0	If you liked Braveheart, you'll like this as well.	2000-12-16	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A13RGMUPG0G5JJ	David Lambert	I like Ridley Scott and was expecting this to be a well made movie with an interesting story, but was sadly disappointed.  The acting was poor and the story and characters were uninteresting.  It's nowhere near as good as the epic movie Spartacus.  Spartacus had great actors, relevant political themes and had several powerful philosophical ideals running through the story.  I loved the scene where Spartacus and the man he was going to fight to death in the arena were sitting together while 2 other gladiators fought outside their holding pen.  No dialogue and none was necessary, but you could really sense the fear and tension the 2 characters were feeling.This Gladiator movie was okay, but not worth buying.  It's not something I'll likely watch a second time.  It just isn't very interesting and the acting doesn't seem that sincere either.	3.0	NOTHING like Spartacus	2001-01-20	7	0	7

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3TSNYQOZTIK23	David McMinn	"I broke down and purchased this blu-ray taking a chance as to the quality of the disc. I have to keep in mind that this is a first generation blu-ray disc and that all videos are not created equal. Some videos are simply Standard DVD transfers with nothing done while others are given the royal treatment before being released. One example of a standard transfer may be Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves while one example of a movie that gets the royal treatment may by Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. Gladiator does seem to fall in between this as there was no WOW effect after watching the movie nor was there a let down either. I have a 32"" Sharp Aquaos 1080i with a Sony Blu-ray player hooked up to an Onkyo HTS-6200 Receiver via HDMI. So this would vary according to your setup.While I read a lot about the exchange program I was skeptical about taking the chance. However, I read The Digital Bits website and [...] web site and decided to take the chance. Contacting Paramount I got hold of one of the nicest customer service reps I've ever talked to in a while. She was patient with me as it was not easy to verify what they were asking for. Paramount if you read this I sent you the wrong disc and I will be happy to send you the right one. SO please contact me.So in about 3 weeks I received my corrected disc with the ""R2"" on the play side and I rushed it ahead of my other disc and I definitely had the WOW effect. I say if you have any questions just call Paramount and they will be glad to help you. I'm glad I did.I just wish the studios are companies that have the rights to release a movie won't rush it to market just to make a sale. As a film enthusiast between SD-DVD and BD-DVD I would prefer the best picture possible along with the best audio possible (Dolby Digital 5.1 / True Dolby / HTS Master audio). We consumers can wait and may be able to pay a little more (Gone With The Wind 70th Anniversary blu-ray collector's edition for example) if the film is released the best way it can be without us having to double are triple did some time in the future.I'm not sure if this belonged in the review section are a forum; but, I just wanted to share my experience."	5.0	5 Stars for the movie are the exchange program	2010-08-30	2	1	1

There is a good balance between the two. When I watched the video, several of the battle scenes blurred and you really didn't get a good view at times because the scene was shot so far back or microscopically close at turbo speed and detracted from my enjoyment of the movie. There were several twists in the plot to keep my interest on how the Gladiator was going to win back his status in the empire. The level of incestuous interest by the part of the brother for his sister was not a highlight of the movie for me. A few of the details like how some of the pivotal information was gleaned by Caeser to intervene on his sister's actions made the movie complicated to follow toward the end. Perhaps additional viewings of the movie will make some things more apparent, but I usually ""get"" movies the first time. I found the movie to be in a similar style to the HBO ""Rome"" series.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2L6U8RY1I05MU	dean_from_sa	This is a great movie for adults that are not squeamish.There are many threads that run through this tale. The one I identified with most was the loyal soldier/family man, who above all seeks to discharge his duties as a soldier and husband/father honorably. At the whim of his adversaries, all that is precious to him is taken away - except his desire to continue on honorably. In short, it is a collage of cliches, but it is not hard to watch because it manages to make sense all the way through.The acting of Russell Crowe is perfect for this role, but I could imagine many of Hwood's best doing a good job in such a well-constructed tale.The cinematography is exemplary and really propels a great tale to the next level.All in all, this is a must watch, if you don't mind a prodigious quantity of blood and death.	4.0	Connects at many levels	2003-01-01	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	GLADIATOR is riveting cinema, the kind of movie that grabs you by the throat.  The stakes are high, the ancient Roman Empire stunningly recreated, and the body of Maximus is . . . well, buff Russell Crowe.  Because of the fast-paced sequences, you won't find yourself bored, or even with enough time to ponder the sometimes confusing details.  (For example, if Maximus had never seen Rome, how did he know Lucilla and Commodus as children, as Marcus Aurelius states early in the film?)  But this is not an intellectual movie, so why bother to figure things out?  This is pure entertainment, as much gory spectacle as the Roman gladiator contests in the Colliseum.  Add a wronged Roman General (Crowe), an effeminate, incest-craving, and slimy new Caesar (Joaquin Phoenix, who portrays Commodus so well his screen presence gave me the creeps), his beautiful and scheming sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson), and a bunch of slaves who band together behind the mysterious Spaniard to save their lives on the largest life-and-death stage, the gladiator arena, and you have Ridley Scott's Gladiator.  You will be rooting for Maximus to exact his revenge no matter how peace-loving you thought you were.I found it ironic - and a little self-referential - when a Roman senator declares that people will love you if you bring them death. This film thrives on slaughter, from start to finish, as it portrays the brutal side of the Roman Empire.  Although the butchering is not as graphic as in some films, avoid this film if you can't stand violence.  Children, too, should be steered clear of this one.  Take the rating seriously.	4.0	A riveting but gory spectacle	2001-01-24	95	59	36

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"At this point, I haven't even begun to pick out the innaccuracies of this film. But, of course, there are, inevitably, the justfiyable comparisons to ""Braveheart"". A blue-eyed Australian-raised actor playing a warrior avenging the death of his family, a tall, willowy noblewoman (and probable victim of incest at the hands of a power-mad ruler)supporting the wronged warrior and visting him in prison, a profiteer helping to bring about the lead character's downfall,the foriegn-born friend who acts as an encourager to the hero, the wise old ruler who dies leaving unresolved issues...Yes, indeed, folks, the Best Picture winners are starting to look too much alike, especially since both "" Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator"" feature scar-faced Tommy Flannagan as an ill-fated supporter of the hero.As Maximus, Russell Crowe, is staid, stoic, and stocky looking. He has a beautifully thick neck and fine muscular build like the expatriated American Aussie who paved the way for other actors from Down Under. But,while he evokes sympathy when mourning the murders of his wife and son, he lacks Gibson's passion and expressiveness.Whoever cast Joaquin Phoenix as the evil Emperor Commodus must have seen the large sculpted head of Constantine the Great that is in the Capitoline Museum in Rome, for with his large, deep-set, but rather sickly-looking eyes, Phoenix certainly resembles it.Frail-looking Richard Harris is the ever-wise Marcus Aurelius. Despite his fragility, he is still elegant of voice, and clear of mind as he wisely chooses Maximus to succeed him. Harris is still impressive to watch onscreen because in the body of this frail-looking old man is a lot of charisma.In his final role, we have the sullen Oliver Reed as a profiteer who enslaves the grieving Maximus and places him in a life-threatening situation. Anyone who saw him in ""Oliver"", ""Tommy"", ""Condorman"", etc., knew he was good in such roles.Danish-born Connie Nielsen, who bears enough resemblance to the Danish Queen, Margarethe in real life, plays the Emperor's sister, Lucilla in this movie. Her ""Braveheart"", counterpart, of course, is Sophie Marceau. -A statuesque natural beauty, who can play very strong-willed characters with aplomb, and comfort the hero during his final hours. The way Ancient Roman jewelry hangs on Ms. Nielsen is very graceful.Djimon Honsou's Juba is the foreign-born supporter who comforts Maximus after the loss of his family and is still standing at the end of the story.I didn't see as much of David Hemmings as I would have liked in this movie. But considering his relationship with Richard Harris in ""Camelot"", it's interesting to see the two work together again.The arena scenes are fast-paced and graphic. But Maximus' warrior skills are extremely helpful in keeping the number of casualties of his men to a minimum, whether on a battle field or in the arena. The scene where a female charioteer is cut down at her midsection is particularly startling.The camera visuals are exhorbitant, as Maximus the Spaniard feels his time on Earth ebbing and his reunion with his wife and son imminent. We can feel his pull towards the afterlife slowly gaining momentum, until he finally wanders through golden fields of wheat towards his loved ones on his way to eternal happiness.Whether or not the costumes were accurate, the colors were regal, rich, and splendid, and the overall statliness and grandeur that was Rome was magnificently recaptured. Humming through it all is an exotic score with a certain mysticism about it.Ridley Scott directed this with as much intensity as was seen in ""1492"", and it is an intensity that has paid off for him."	4.0	Somber, Regal, Action-Packed	2001-11-09	1	1	0

LA Confidential was hot at the time when they announced he was doing Gladiator and I thought, I believe this man is going places but a Gladiator???...P>His performance is strong, stoic and yet very moving, showing a fine range. The secondary leads are magnificent, especially Richard Harris and Oliver Reed.  The computer work more than convinces us of the 'cast of thousands' in the battle scenes and the arena.It's great to see this sort of historical drama once again being made and receiving such recognition.As I said, Outstanding!!!	5.0	Crowe rose to the occassion!!

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ACDRXGW0B2CGV	"DEC ""scotrugby"""	"I cannot say enough good things about this movie, it is without a doubt the finest film I have ever seen (sorry Citizen Kane). It is important for those who have not seen the film to understand that this isn't a kill them all type film. This film has a fantastic story, compelling characters, and a soundtrack that Mozart would be proud of. The music should have gotten the best supporting actor, because it completely captures the emotions of the characters, especially Maximus.  The ""earthy"" theme that Hans describes in the bonus documentary on this DVD is what I refer to as the ""victory"" song.  It is played when he is praying, but it also comes about when the group wins its first fight in Rome during the ""Battle of Carthage"" at a much higher tempo.  Those that criticize the ending as being sad, I ask this question (warning, spoiler here) Why is is a sad ending?  Maximus got to be with his family at the end of the movie, which was his goal at the beginning, he got what he wanted.  There was an afterlife, therefore, there is no reason to be sad about it. It's a victory for him. This is a true epic,  I could go on for days.  Buy this DVD if you do not own it yet, it will be something to show future generations. (I still shed a tear at the end when they carry him, not because I am sad, but because of the respect and honor they give him.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3HTKV1AW14EDB	"Denise Bentley ""Kelsana"""	A film of epic proportion matched by digital technology that leaves the watcher ensconced in a world where to maim and kill is to succeed and survive. Russell Crowe exudes strength, and intelligence, with a winning ability to lead men as empires fall at his feet.Maximus (Crowe), a general in the Roman army, has been slated by the reigning Emperor to lead Rome and return it to the people, removing it from the hands of the senate, which has ruled with duplicity. He finds himself betrayed by a pathetic, power hungry man. No longer a favored soldier, he is sold into slavery, where as a gladiator, his need for revenge grows strong, keeping him alive as he wins over the crowds in the gladiator's arena.The schemes and intrigue that takes place in the darkness of the night, along with the subtle threats that initiate the treachery among family members keeps you craving that justice which is robustly delivered by director Ridley Scott. The final showdown takes our hero to the infamous coliseum, where he faces an array of weapons and opponents. What a satisfying pleasure it will be to witness justice at its finest hour.This Academy Award nominated film is certainly a 5 star production and a movie that will stand the test of time. The surround-sound alone leaves you feeling like part of the crowd as they stomp and cheer for the Gladiators.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2OFSDJB3MVQ16	Dennis W. Wong	"For many wags and cynics in Hollywood, the days of the epic ""sword and sandals"" flick was over but like the Western, if it's done right like it here--you can have a winner!! Russell Crowe and director Ridley Scott  have made a film almost comparable to Kubrick's ""Spartacus"" in depicting a man's quest for freedom--how universal can you get?  Supported by a fine cast which includes Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix in a break-through role, Connie Nielsen, the late Richard Harris and Oliver Reed plus ""I Claudius"" Derek Jacobi, ""Gladiator"" will dazzle and entrance you.  I will never understand why a critic like Roger Ebert would give this absorbing film such a negative review--I'm sure his late colleague Gene Siskel would've give this a thumbs up.  I've seen this film several times in the theater and on video--and I can't wait for the Blu-ray edition to come out.  Well to update things a little, I've just bought the Blu-ray edition of this fine film from Frys and despite the negative reviews of the Blu-ray, I still found the film watchable and definitely an upgrade from the Standard def version.  There are a lot worse transfers in Blu-ray (The Italian Job, Clockwork Orange) than this film.  I do intend to keep it unless there is a better Blu-ray transfer of this classic."	5.0	"Practically the best ""sword and sandals"" epic yet!!"	2009-07-01	3	1	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3S7WU6DIH71CC	Denny Vu Quach	Gladiatorial combat is immortalized in this film, the only way it can be: through stunning action sequences and beautiful imagery. It also immortalizes, above all, director Ridley Scott.Roger Ebert complains of people with short memory spans praising this film while forgetting that films like Spartacus have supposedly done this before. Well, I have a good memory, and I remember Spartacus. In fact, I kept on remembering that film while watching Gladiator, only in the context of, &quot;This is so much better than Spartacus. It goes beyond.&quot; The action is better, the visuals are better, the story is better, and the acting is better. Sorry, Kirk.Since this is an action film, the story isn't the most important element, but for an action film it is actually quite good. For one thing, I liked the disturbing under-the-surface incest element going on between Commodus and Connie Nielson. Furthermore, it was interesting to see how Crowe gained support among the gladiators until it became as if he were a general leading his army again. The plot itself needed to be there in order to fully create a sense of grandeur. With its insurrection story, the rise of the hero and his trek to the capitol of Rome, and the look at the people in power, the plot creates a sense of time-and-place necessary for an epic that couldn't exist with the visuals and action alone.The acting is among the best one can ever seen for an action film, and there is plenty of fine dramatic work pulled off by the two main actors. Russell Crowe is now one of the best &quot;new&quot; (four or five films so far) actors in film. We believe, in his glances and the ways he delivers his many great lines, that he is Maximus. He is poignant, hate-filled, and sorrowful all at once. The praise he is getting is deserved. But why isn't Phoenix being lauded just as much? He carries the film in the second-largest role just as well as Crowe. His Emperor Commodus isn't a good villain and has no real character, but Phoenix adds so many layers to him and turns him into a great antagonist that that alone makes his performance excellent. He commands attention just as Crowe does. All by himself (no help from any great dialogue or development), he creates a villain that is prissy, whining, ambitious, pathetic, and malevolent, and worthy of our hate as well as our pity. It's a wonderful transformation. To sum it up, the characters themselves aren't really developed at all- but the acting is so good that it seems they are.Now, onto the action, which, as I had hoped, is plentiful and intense. It has diversity and grandeur. All the fights were fast, hard-hitting, uncensored, and very bloody, which is what they should've been like. And every single fight sequence is unique from the others. There's the match where two men fought chained to each other, the opening war battle, Maximus vs. numerous other fighters, and the final sword duel, to name a few. This is so much more than just two half-naked men fighting with swords, which is what it could've been. The film also captures the feel and the motion of combat. Ridley Scott speeds up the film slightly during fight scenes to show the chaos and rapid reflexes necessary to survive. During the fight scenes, the camerawork is nonstop and covers the combat as one big blur to the fighters. (But we can still follow the fights themselves.)This film also stands out in my mind as one of the most visual, image-driven action films I've ever seen. Thanks to Ridley Scott, practically every scene is jammed with wonderful detail, art direction, even distinct lighting (the Collosseum orange, other parts of Rome dark blue). Just look at the wide multitude (seemingly infinite number) of battle masks, weapons, and locales. Cinematography is skillful and impressive. There are tons of memorable shots, like Maximus entering the ring with rose petals coming down on him like rain from above, Commodus' pure white battle costume (when he's being risen up on the platform he looks like a demented angel ascending to heaven), and the images used to represent Crowe's home- the gentle hand carressing the wheat reeds, the door to his house, etc. They had a surreal quality and each were bathed in their own distinct color. Excellent work, Ridley.A very impressive film. So why can't all summer movies be this good? We'd be spoiled.	5.0	We salute you, Ridley.	2004-04-12	1	0	1

I truely beleive that a movie like this is why they build movie theatres, a true credit to today's movies.  I experienced &quot;GLADIOTOR&quot; at a THX CERTIFIED Multi-channel DOLBY DIGITAL Theatre, the perfect place to view a film of such scale.  &quot;GLADIOTOR&quot; is the story of Loyalty, Betrayal, Deceit, broken love, and the demons that haunt a young man as he go's thru life having no choice but to murder innocent people, at the command of his master.  Russel Crowe is very convinceing in the title role, and the supporting cast adds to the overall effect as well.  The film is an omage to the films of the late fifties and early sixties, such as SPARTACUS and BEN HUR.  Only this time, a bit more realistic, and with state of the art picture and sound.  However, the pagendry and scope still prevails, alowing moviegoers of all generations to appreciate a work of art.  The Cinematography is excellent, never have I seen the city of Rome photographed so well.  Set designs are again flawless, buetiful.  It is difficult to turn away from Ridley Scott's latest epic,who, by the way, hasn't fallen victim to the ravidges of the modern movie, which use sex and violence to lure their audience in.  Instead, GLADIOTOR tells a story, one of pure excitment and majesty.  The dvd sounds superb, filling the entire sound field, the music score masterly recorded and combined.  Special effects mind blowing, well balanced wolfer and surrounds.  Over all, GLADIOTOR is a film worth purchasing, and I wouldn't be suprised if it garners Oscar nominations.  Deep where the patriot was shallow, concerned about the story more than its own revinue.  Let this film be a lesson to Roland Emerich. Drive a movie with your mind, not with your wallet.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A293HA28PN3VO4	":::DIGITAL BABE::: "":::DIGITAL BABE:::"""	"This review is for the UK Steelbook release (same transfer as US version). I viewed it on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Panasonic player.I am a huge, long-time fan of this film, and like many, was looking forward to the Blu-Ray release. Although I had read some preview reviews, I am very impressed with this Blu-Ray. I do not own the UK Superbit, which I am told is a better overall transfer, but in comparison to the standard definition version, which I did own, this film is an obvious upgrade. I own 390+ Blu-Rays and this is one of the sharpest and color rich transfers I have seen so far. I think the anticipation of fans, put an extreme expectation on perfection for this transfer, as did the studio's touting of the ""superior"" nature of the ""Sapphire"" series. And yes, I have seen several ""reference-quality"" BD's, like the UK Zulu which remains the best PQ I have ever seen, along with discs such as I Robot.There are some problems with this disc, due to over-digitization. But those scenes were few and far between, for me, and the detail, starting from the opening battle scene, down to those where Maximus is walking through the fields, and daylight shots, the clarity and detail on this disc is amazing. The DTS sound also does not disappoint, as it did not in the SD version. It is also possible that some with an LCD screen, or other brighter settings will see more of the digitization, but in Cinema Mode (my setting of choice), on a Plasma, the theater experience was replicated with true representation at home, for me.  The film remains one of my favorite films of all time, and it continues to be towards the top of my list for Drama films. The cast is at its best, and Ridley and all creative talent involved deserve every accolade bestowed upon this film.Regardless of what you hear from threads and reviews, give this disc a chance, at least as a rental.

I do too.My question is regarding the disc.I got this movie from Best Buy after price match over thanksgiving sale for $3.99.This is what I noticed:The case does not have an outer sleeve.On the back cover, I see ""2-DISC SET"" above the paramount logo.The UPC barcode is WHITE.Upon opening the case, there are two grey discs.I flipped DISC ONE over and held it up to the light. Needed my reading glasses but upon fine adjusting could finally make out the numbers to be NA13081B1R2 on the inner ring. I was relieved that they end in 'R2.'However, I flipped DISC 2 over and I saw the numbers NA13081B1R1.I was concerned so I scoured the web for reviews and screenshots.I re-watched the opening scene and the movie name GLADIATOR appears black and stays black as it fades away.The rest of the movie which I watched in THEATRICAL EDITION was great. I'm watching this on a 50"" 1080P Panasonic plasma.My questions:1. Is it true that I have the remastered version of the movie only?2. Is it true that the DISC 2 is still the old version?3.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2T8E1QEYJD0CY	D. Konig	The Gladiator DVD is probably one of the best DVDs out with extras.  In fact, it is so loaded with them they needed a second disc!Everyone knows what a great movie it was... but how about the bonuses?  Those deleted scenes were okay.  Nothing ended up on the cutting room floor that was too traumatic except for one scene where they toss Christian children into the arena.  Everyone knows that it was unfair, because the lions always had the homefield advantage.The best part of the DVD bonuses is the two documentaries, one about the making of the movie, and a historical account of the real life gladiators.  The historical account heavily relies on the accuracy of the movie to tell its story.We already know that Gladiator was a blockbuster in the theatre.  The extras on the disc have now made it a blockbuster @ home.	5.0	A Classic Set In An Ancient Time With Modern Bonuses We Want	2000-11-27	15	14	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	In the year 2000, when movies seemed emotionless and stale, thousands of movie-goers cried out for one movie, one that would satisfy their long-parched taste for something on a large, epic scale. Ridley Scott's latest film, &quot;Gladiator,&quot; takes a stab (literally) at this need, and succeeds for the most part. In terms of scale and wonder, the film is a very impressive and awe-inspiring achievement, one that leaps onto the screen with a roar instead of a whimper.In terms of keeping audiences involved in its plot, there is something left to be desired. While the movie aspires to be like such epics as &quot;Braveheart,&quot; it doesn't have the same emotional pull as that earlier film, nor is it as engrossing. You will drop your jaws over the spectacle of the film, but its soul will leave you untouched.Taking historical time periods and working in a fictitious storyline can have its ups and downs. Here, the result is mostly a success, supposedly based on records from the actual days of Rome, about a man who started out as a general and went from being enslaved to being the most renowned gladiator to ever fight in front of an audience.That general is Maximus (Russell Crowe), who, after a satisfying defeat of a Germanian army, earns him the role of successor to the emperor's throne after his forthcoming death. That death is expedited by the conniving Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), whose jealous rage over the emperor's decision leads him to having Maximus murdered. Of course, what kind of movie would allow that? He escapes, becomes the property of a man who puts his slaves into the arena for gladiator challenges.Maximus sees this as a window back to Rome, where he may once again face his rival. But it is here that the story begins to place unneeded subplots and contrivances, and as a result, it loses its touch with the audience.One of those subplots is a love relationship between Maximus and Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus's sister, which doesn't really take effect until his return to Rome. There was never any real reason to believe in a spark between the two of them in the beginning: Maximus had a wife and child to return home to (though they were later murdered), and Lucilla seems too devoted to her brother to be involved with anyone else. It seems as if the movie needs more emotional strings in the final third, and tries to throw something together, hoping for success.An overabundance of fight sequences seems to drown the movie in testosterone, lessening any emotional impact we may feel at the end. Two sequences is enough for us to gather in what the days of Rome were all about, and each sequence is beautifully choreographed and staged for some very authentic and intense battle images. You may hold your breath in the beginning, but after a while, it tends to become redundant.That's not to say the movie is a flop. By all means, no, for it is a breathtaking period piece that showcases just exactly what Rome was all about in the past. When I hear the word &quot;Rome,&quot; one word comes to mind: colossal, and the film portrays it as such, from the stunning visual effects used to create the Colosseum, to the overall spectacle embodied in the costume designs, and even the score from composer Hans Zimmer, which, standing alone, could create the film on its own.The cast also fits nicely into their roles. Russell Crowe is perfect as Maximus, the ideal hero for one of those roles that the actor is born to play from day one. Connie Nielsen is honest and convincing in her role as Lucilla, even if her character has little to do but watch as her hero faces certain death (and even then, her performance is high-caliber). Joaquin Phoenix is chillingly effective as a cold-blooded tyrant who is unconcerned with the welfare of his empire, but more involved with what their opinion of him is.&quot;Gladiator&quot; is not completely heartless, but it lacks the same emotional intrigue of past epics that possess that same scale and scope of events. It's battle and fight sequences become a way of life by movie's end, but they are, nonetheless, visually stunning, as is the overall design of the film and the equally impressive acting. I was not moved to tears, but was left with a look of wonderment.	4.0	Big in scale, yet lacking in emotional involvement.	2001-01-25	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A23XVF23C7BHP0	"D. M. Farmbrough ""Dave Farmbrough"""	This film is fortunate in that it is built round the very strong central performance of Russell Crowe. Otherwise its credibility would have been compromised by a series of blunders inexcusable is such a big budget undertaking from such an experienced director. To make a list seems churlish, so I will do so.1. The sounds of the battle scenes are so obviously dubbed on afterwards. The battle scenes are very ambitious, full marks to Scott for 'having a go' at showing what it is really like in battle, but the dubbed soundtrack, invasive music and good grief, even dialogue out of synch just make this look silly.2. The plot is predictable. it is obvious the son will kill Caesar, obvious that Gladiator will spurn the new Caesar, obvious he will escape execution, and obvious his family will be killed3. The characters are ciphers, the same few people we have seen in every Roman Empire film from Ben Hur to the present day - you almost expect Lurcio to pop out and begin the prologue!4. The scene where the boy is trampled by horses is predictable and it looks like they are using a dummy5. The opening battle scenes somehow have the speed tampered with. they look a bit like a Ray Harryhausen battle scene only not as good. There's odd little bits of CGI used here for no apparent reason.6. Richard Harries (presumably fatigued from holding down his weekend job as the Bishop of Oxford) gives a rather camp 'by numbers' performance of the exiting emperor. This is his last chance for him to give the world his King Lear and he's obviously determined to make sure we get it!7. Joaquim Phoenix's diction is at times unintelligible.8. The obvious CGI work on the flock of crows flying past the coliseum9. The inclusion of Derek Jacobi. He's a fine actor, but his presence merely reminds us that the BBC has done Rome before, and better than this in I ClaudiusBut there are some merits to this film. Despite being long, its pace never flags. Crowe does some of his best acting when he is silent. As any actor will tell you, this is the most difficult type of acting, and it is unusual for the lead character in a film to have so much of it. But Scott shows great sensitivity in lingering on Crowe's expressions for just long enough to convey the emotions, and credit must go to the editor for this.Oliver Reed is just superb. What a shame he was killed before the film was finished, because it could do with a bit more of him. I am certain Russell Crowe's Gladiator voice was modelled on Reeds. Compare them and I think you will agree.The feeling of the bloodiness of battle and the empire is so well conveyed that you can almost smell the blood.The staging of the battle scenes and the skill of the stunt men is unquestionable. But the camera is in close up for far too long and it's confusing. You only really know the outcome of a skirmish at its end. Some close-ups are needed in this type of film as it's tempting to let the big budget sets and crowd scenes leave you with only long shots and huge pans, but this isn't the right place for close-up work.The scenes with the Gladiator riding cross country are good, reminiscent of the best scenes from Blackadder. If you don't believe me, watch it!	4.0	Exciting, enjoyable, magnificent!	2001-10-23	0	0	0

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	Tell me a story.In essence, that is all we as consumers of entertainment demand when we open a book or watch a movie.  Yes, we may have our reservations (e.g., &quot;I don't like the actor&quot;...&quot;This is not historically accurate&quot;...&quot;This plot has been presented thousands of times before&quot;...), but in the end, ultimately, the triumphant success--or lack thereof--of any work is wholly dependent on its ability to tell a gripping, compelling story.Ridley Scott gives us a story in GLADIATOR.  From the opening scenes in barbaric Germania, to the bowels of dusty dungeons in distant lands, to the eye-opening magnificence of the Roman Coliseum, to the wondrous luxury of the palace of Emperor Commodus, GLADIATOR tells a moving, thrilling, harrowing story of heroism and revenge.  At the end of this film, when an avenged Maximus is finally able to join his murdered wife and son in the afterlife, I as a viewer experienced completion...the story had been told.Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielson, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris and company give exceptional performances.

Good intrigue, and twists, along with some robust (bloody) gladiator fights.  This movie makes Russell Crowe, and he makes the movie.  Joquin Phoenix delivers a great performance being a demented Caesar (Comodus) who gains audience sympathy with his sick and twisted weaknesses (his search for being loved).  His sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) is exceptionally regal, without being overly affected.Richard Harris does a surprisingly great job and his short performance sets the stage as Caesar Augustus - the great leader and empire builder whose failed fatherhood (to Comodus) leads to the conflagration between Maximus and Comodus.Story:Rome's greatest general Maximus (Crowe) finds himself thrust into slavery when he narrowly escapes being murdered on the orders of Comodus (Phoenix). Maximus' personal mission is to avenge the brutal deaths of his wife and son against Comodus; then to join his family in the hereafter.  Fearful for the life of her young son Lucilla (Nielson) gains hope in staging a revolt through Maximus when she finds him alive in the Coloseum.  Because of his fierce fighting style, Rome loves the slave Maximux and Comodus cannot directly kill him.Negatives:Some of the gladiator fights are detailed and therefore gory, so be careful who you see this film with.Also, the pagan concept of death and the portrayal of the ""hereafter"" feels spiritually empty.

Russell Crowe easily solidifies his name as one of the top actors of the day.  The film is grand and Ridley Scott has definitely created a masterpiece in the same vein as Braveheart, El Cid, or Ben-Hur.  Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as Commodus, and shows a strong range of acting ability.  Russell Crowe's character who is seeking only peace, must walk through a fire of life in order to gain it.  Crowe portrays a Roman Soldier and gladiator with a sense of honor that one would find in a Marine.  Crowe never loses faith in his purpose to do what he must do, and he honors his word, his family, and the former emperor Marcus Aurelius (Oliver Reed)in the film.  Dijon Honshu (Amistad) plays a good friend and confidant to Maximus.  It is truly a marvelous movie, and a masterpiece of a film.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A35YWA2V4QHOJ3	"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12"""	This is an extraordinary epic which takes place at the end of the reign of the Antonine emperors.  OK, so they do fudge history, but so what?  It's a magnificent story of a fictional character (a Roman General named Maximus, played by Crowe) who comes into contact with historical characters, such as Marcus Aurelius and his ignominious son, Commodus.  There are also allusions to the great Roman orator Cicero (his name bequeathed to Maximus' servant) and the Gracchus brothers (Gracchus is the name of a benevolent senator in the film).  There are also some nice references made to the Battle of Zama (in 202 - defeat of Hannibal), Antony &amp; Cleopatra and Cladius Caesar.Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the film lies in its depiction of Aurelius &amp; Commodus.  Aurelius is seen as a magnificent and magnanimous leader;  history remembers him as the closest anyone has ever come to Socrates' &quot;philosopher king.&quot;  Commodus is just as accurately portrayed as the vile, corrupt ignoramous that he was.  During his reign, there was a rumor which spread thru all of Rome that Aurelius' wife had had an affair with a sailor.  According to the scuttlebut, Commodus was the result of the episode;  the Romans simply refused to believe that a man so despicable as Commodus could come from the loins of the noble Aurelius.  The presentation of his character in this movie brings that out exceptionally well.This is yet another instant classic directed by the creative genius of Ridley Scott.  The film is well done &amp; the sets take you back to the height of the Roman empire.  For background information on this period, I would recommend reading Marcus Aurelius' stoic &quot;Meditations&quot; as well as  Michael Grant's &quot;The Antonines.&quot; The latter book covers this epoch of Roman history.  These are not essential, but do offer a nice backdrop as to what's going on during this age. They could very well increase the viewer's enjoyment of this marvelous visual spectacle.	5.0	Belongs up there with &quot;Spartacus&quot; and &quot;Ben Hur&quot;	2001-01-17	1	1	0

Director Ridley Scott recreates the Roman Empire in all its decadence, as an heroic Roman General is betrayed by the greedy and unscrupulous son of the Emperor, and forced to become a slave and a gladiator.Russell Crowe is outstanding as Maximus, the general who is favored by his Emperor (an excellent cameo by Richard Harris) to lead the Empire over his greedy and unstable son Commodus (played with over the top depravity by Joaquin Phoenix).  Commodus murders his father, takes the throne, slaughters the family of Maximus, and consigns him to slavery.  A wise slave trader (Oliver Reed in his last film role) sees Maximus' potential and turns him into a gladiator.  Maximus' military skills make him a formidable competitor who fights his way to fame with the Roman mob and draws the fateful envy of Commodus.  The stage is set for betrayal and violent confrontation.The set-piece gladiator combats are thrilling and worth the movie by themselves.  A superb supporting cast enhances the movie, notably Connie Nielson as the sister of Commodus and the object of his depraved desire.  The recreation of Rome is detailed and authentic.  The movie is highly recommended as good entertainment."	4.0	A fight to the death...	2007-09-16	0	0	0

And he didn't disappoint.It tells of a head chef, played with great aplomb by Russell Crowe, who is part of the Roman empire's quest to spread pasta throughout Europe. After banishing the upstart Germans and their sausages, Russell wants to return home to and start up a hawker store and introduce the Sticky Rice to his local community (and Laksa as well - he loves his chilli).However the young upstart emperor, played with a maniacal hongkie zeal by Joaquin Phoenix has other ideas.  He wants to open up a new chain of restaurants where waiters are put into a ring and have to cook up a plate of pasta while dodging drunk lions, belligerent Zulus and other restaurant competitors who want to steal their recipe.  And so Russell is thrust into it!There are great waitering action sequences here.  Witness Russell and his band of waiters cook up a plate of Fettuccine Bosialoa while dodging fish and chips from the English and tacos from the Mexicans.  However the supreme moment is when Russell is near death and what it looks like,to be maggots festering in his wound.  For all aficionado's of the Rice, we know that it was actually sticky rice pouring out of his body to heal the wound.  Full marks must go to Ridley for daring to reveal the secrets of the Sticky Rice sect and exposing the trials and tribulations of the first hawker food owners in Europe.Just a side note, while filming in Morocco, Ridley Scott actuallyintroduced the Sticky Rice to the local cuisine.  The community devoured it.  They now have developed their own Sticky Rice - has a dash of sand in it.  Believe me, might sound a bit funky but it gives it a nicecrunchy flavour.	4.0	Historically accurate	2002-02-14	6	1	5

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2429XNXJU585Q	"Ed Holstein ""Ed"""	This movie has drawn many comparisons to Braveheart.  The basic difference between the two besides taking place in different times and in different countries ... is that Braveheart is supposed to be based around, however loosely, the life of William Wallace whereas Gladiator is almost purely fiction.If one looks at &quot;Gladiator&quot; through the same lens through which they view Braveheart, they are not giving the movie a fair shake.Gladiator is a good old-fashioned hero movie. It doesn't matter if its characters dress like real romans did or speak like them, which they obviously don't.What is endearing about Gladiator is primarily embodied in the character of Maximus.  He loves his family, he is loyal to the king, he fights for his ideals, he brings the smack down when necessary.I give Gladiator 4 stars because I feel that is accomplished all that it set out to but it could have set out to accomplish more.Just as a side note:  The action is all first-rate, I was especially impressed with the &quot;Battle of Carthage&quot; scene.	4.0	Fits well into its own shoes	2000-10-24	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A35AMPDFAB8JLT	Edmonson	"Gladiator is directed by Ridley Scott, and his exquisite use of shadow and tone are showcased in this film. This story is set in the time of Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), and his successor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Russell Crowe portrays a gladiator, Maximus Meridas, who comes back to reap his revenge on Commodus after being forced into slavery. Connie Nielson, Derek Jacobi, and Oliver Reed also star in this film. What makes this movie so good, besides the great cinematography, are the strong characters. This film is as much about the choices people make in life and how this affects their lives, as the ebbs and flows of our existence.This blu-ray disc was filmed with 5.1 dts master audio and in 1080p. There is some evidence of DNR(digital noise reduction) and EE(edge enhancement), but nothing so much that it spoiled my viewing of the film. The film is mostly crisp and clear. This disc also has lots of extras, including deleted scenes, interviews with scholars about history, and commentary from Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott, but best of all is the inclusion of an extended cut which has sixteen extra minutes of deleted scenes. Those that enjoy this film may also want to check out HBO's ""Rome"" series which is a gritty depiction of Roman history around the time of Julius Caesar, and Antony and Cleopatra."	4.0	Captivating historical drama	2009-09-02	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2YHSIQQMSK2M6	"E. D. Seaman ""E2D"""	Russell Crowe does an admirable job portraying Maximus, a general serving Marcus Aurelus, one of the last Ceasar's in Rome sometime around 180 A.D. Maximus is betrayed and ultimately ends up as a gladiator. A gladiator was a slave who was required to fight to the death against other such slaves. Sometimes it was possible to win your freedom.The overiding message of the film is that maintaining the virtues of strength and honor sometimes requires sacrifice and may ultimately lead to death. There is much graphic violence and I suggest you guard your mind because the movie presents a worldview full of ancestor worship, and 'all roads lead to heaven' philosophy. If you are searching for Truth you will not find it here. Also, I commend the producers for making a movie without even the briefest of nudity or unneeded sex scenes.For a movie extolling the virtues of strength and honor as well as being full of adventure I highly recommend this film. No movie, including this one is worth over ... so I would wait for the price to drop and rent it until that day.'The Gladiator' deserves a ten out of twelve on my rating scale and will soon, when the price drops, have a place on my top ten shelf.Semper fi &amp; agape, Ed D.	4.0	Strength and Honor	2000-11-25	6	3	3

Once you get into the movie and the fight scenes and start rooting for Maximus you realize that we haven't evolved all that much since Roman times.  Yeah we don't get to chop each other up in public but we're still all turned on by the same things.  And the politics of the Roman empire have an erie resemblance to the politics of the US.  With WWF/WCW and professional sports so popular these days you can see how we're not far off.  So on one hand the film is entertaining.  On the other hand by buying this film you're endorsing the downfall of Rome, which in some twisted way will be a similar to our own fate.

This movie drags in the center very badly.  I saw the movie and the battle scenes are the only things that kept me awake, otherwise this movie is abysmal.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1TKUJ9XHY8YCJ	"EgoTrader ""egotrader"""	I can't understand how this movie beat out Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon for best picture? Just goes to show how scandalous and racist the Oscar committee are. This movie will insult your intelligence! If you remember studying western civilization, the movie greatly overexaggerates the actual fighting methods devised by the Romans, Romans fought in legions not in cascading style; and greatly overexaggerates the actual fighting that took place in the colosseum, nobody really got killed-this is a myth propogated by Hollywood. How about how he took 2 horses to race home against the Preatorians who were going to kill his family? Wouldn't both horses get tired? A lot of scenes where cut out which would have explained some lines in the movie better...maybe you can find them. I found a bunch of &quot;why did he say that&quot; type lines through the whole movie, like why Crowe was called &quot;the Spaniard&quot;? The movie never mentioned that he lived in Spain. Too many incomplete things in this movie. Something telling of the weakness of the director. This is another one of those movies who took on a span too much than could be made into a movie. Russell Crowe didn't have a long enough monologue in the entire movie worthy of the praise gratuitiously bestowed upon him by critics. No Gordon Gekko performance here. Crowe had some of the easiest lines in the whole movie. Phoenix on the other hand had some great lines. The fight scenes where thrown together in disarray, scenes which should have been the staple of the movie, stood empty and disappointing. Just because a movie takes on a huge cinematic scale like a Ben Hur doesn't make it great. This movie was very disappointing. Joaquin gave the best performance. Crowe gave a mediocre performance. This movie is not in the same class of some of the greatest like Goodfellas, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Saving Private Ryan. This is a one time watcher. I could watch Goodfellas, Crouching Tiger and Scarface over and over again. This will stay on my shelf for a while.	3.0	* * MOST OVER RATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME * *	2001-06-22	7	3	4

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3UUL8AYLC5NUD	E. Leaf	Gladiator is a good movie (although not as great as some would have you believe), and I highly recommend it.  However, I take issue with the idea that it is at all historically accurate.In reference to Trevor Cook's review (see below), there is little actual history in this movie.  Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor who died in the beginning of the movie, did not die at the hands of his son, Commodus.  Rather, he caught a dangerous infection (possibly plague) and died at his camp at Vindobona (Vienna).  And the Emperor had named his son Commodus his heir several years before that.It is not known if Commodus went mad.  However, he was known for his cruelty and he did fall victim to his physical vices.  He often appeared in staged lion and tiger hunts in the Coliseum, where he liked to call himself Hercules.Because he enraged many of Rome's senators, they tried to assassinate him with the help of his sister, Lucilla.  But the plot failed.  Commodus naturally became paranoid and therefore launched a campaign of terror against his enemies.  Eventually, an assassination attempt against him was successful, and he was strangled in his bath (and not, as the reviewer below would have you believe, in battle as a gladiator).So, while Gladiator is a good movie and I have nothing against it, do not mistake it for history.  It is a fictional account based on historical people.  Nothing more and nothing less.	4.0	Gladiator a good movie, but not historically acurate.	2001-02-22	4	1	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2QML92353G4GG	ellisfan	The virtues of the film have been extolled at great length in previous reviews, so I shall here instead praise the greatness of the DVD. It is a dual-disc release, the first disc containing the film itself, and the second disc all the &quot;extras.&quot; And, true to any Ridley Scott outing, the extras are there in great abundance. The second disc contains almost 2 hours worth of very well done documentary (nearly 1 full hour on the history of the gladiators of the Roman Empire, 1 half hour documentary on the filming of 'Gladiator,' and 1 half hour documentary on the scoring of the film which is itself worth buying the DVD for). Other features include story-board, stills from the film and cast/crew, the diary of someone who worked on the film which was written during production, production notes, deleted scenes and other goodies. Other films have far, far less for twice the price. The 'Gladiator' DVD is, in my opinion, the perfect example of why I love the DVD format, with its ability to contain more information and features. In this case, it helps to flesh out the experience of Ridley Scott's truly brilliant film, making it even more exciting and moving. It is a must have in any DVD collection.	5.0	Brilliant film, FANTASTIC special features	2000-11-22	0	0	0

Maximus was the one fictional  character of a real story.  We don't know if it happened this way, but it  could of.  Marcus Aurealis dies one of the greatest of Roman Emperors and  the last of the golden age of Rome.  Only to be succeeded by his son,  Commedus, who was a vain, foolish, and comtemptable tyrant. I believed that  this story was stunning visually and dramatically, the effects were  delicious with just enough gore, to provide with one of the best stories I  have ever seen.  I was moved countless times, by all the characters.  Even  Commedus, the tyrant, you loved him and felt sorry for him, because he  didn't really want to be the tyrant, he wanted the love of his  father, and  without that he became horribly ambitious. Five stars just sometimes  doesn't seem good enough.	5.0	This movie well represents the time period.	2000-09-14	62	46	16
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A39IDVXUEW3RHZ	"""enigma35"""	Historical hokum is what this movie is all about.  Crowe's character was made up along with the whole story.  Any man or woman that knows anything about Roman history should be offended by this movie.  I guess the producers and directors thought by showing you good costumes and battle scenes assumed they could trick you into not thinking for yourself. The sad part is they probably were successfull with a minute exception of viewers.The movies finale speaks for the entire film. A roman emperor doing battle with the gladiator in the colliseum. The absurdity of portraying something like this shows Hollywood's true arrogance.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A228NBNLYJ8V3J	Eran Cohen	Seeing this for the first time today, it was greater than I could've ever imagined. For the first in a long time I felt overwhelmed, dazzled and completely in identification with the movie.I truly admire the film, the writer, the director, and the crew -  They've done a superb work. Reviving a distant history tale to life is an admirable achievement I will always salute to.The thing that seized me most of all is the model Mister Russell Crowe portrayed. This is certainly not a surprise, for he was meant to do just that, being the good hero, nevertheless, the core of his being still stands out, maybe more for people like myself than for others.I'm trying to express here that the Gladiator is unique for representing the survival of the is right and honorary in a world that is crumbling apart, and that is running out of all the things people consider as good, true and justified. Despite the horrible world surrounding him, Maximus (Crowe) manages to survive - But not by completely becoming a ruthless beast. He does develop and uses dreadful skills of an animal - but only to survive. Whenever he can the man of honor in him evokes to show that he isn't completely corrupted, and forward, to show that this good side is his true self.For that I'm humbled. I want to always remember this in spite of the world where living in, which tends to drag a man down a slippery road of corruption and acts that lack all honor. Our culture is degrading in a one-way direction toward decadence, and I think that anyone who objects this mainstream should stay true to what he believes in no matter what the rest do or think. It's a hard task, very hard; there are so many temptations out there, and obstacles to pass through. In here, Maximus give us an example of endurance - and for that he deserves all the credit we can give him - in return.Maybe a moral of the story could be that if you fight hard you will eventually win . I'd like to believe it is true. Russell Crowe has created in me one more sincere hope it is achievable, and it's a great sucess for itself.In the end, he did win the Oscar price, he earned respectively. In all the other aspects this film is magnificent . I'm glad the film has won all those Oscars, evidently, the best film of last year ,and of course - not one to be missed.	5.0	Can't find words.	2001-06-16	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK	"Eric James Cooper ""ejames43"""	This is my second review of Gladiator.  Why?  Because I am that disappointed that it got the award for best picture.  This movie was typical summer fodder for American film-goers.  A story that was akin to Braveheart with a predictable plot.  Yawn.  Oh, the action sequences were great - though they were too few.  The subplots were under-developed.  This movie was just okay.If you want to see the real best picture of 2000 look no further than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Also much better is Traffic.American movies are so self-absorbed with big budget over the top CGI than bombard you and leave any resemblence of story to waste.  Titanic, Pearl Harbor, Gladiator....when will the litany of pomp and circumstance end?	3.0	Best picture?  Not likely!	2001-06-06	7	5	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	It's true that this isn't really historically accurate, but who cares? This is an ACTION film, and we're supposed to be entertained by its action-packed images that would have our adrenaline overflowing. Ridley Scott sure knows how to mix action with drama. I was greatly inspired by not only the battle scenes (both in the forest and in the coliseum), but also the visual spectacle that is Rome. Yes, it's CGI, but it looks so beautiful. The acting is also a plus. Crowe, Nielsen, and Phoenix are excellent here, though I was devastated to see that Crowe won the oscar instead of Tom Hanks for Cast Away. But anyway, they're all brilliant I enjyoed watching this film very much. Grade: A	5.0	"""What we do in life echoes in eternity."""	2009-04-16	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1LR8M0KBCWJK7	Erik McCurdy	Gladiator is an admirable film not only for its intense, elaborate, and realistic action, but also for its powerful underlying statement regarding human nature.  Although the combat sequences are riveting, Scott deftly delivers a profound message of anti-violence, and exposes the corrupt, barbaric nature that belied the outward civility of the Roman Empire.  This film operates on several different levels, and does so effectively.And anyone who tells you that the story is completely devoid of historical accuracy certainly doesn't know his or her Roman history.  The real Emperor Commodus did, in fact, participate in the games at the Coliseum.  I have always believed that it is better to appear ignorant in silence than to speak and remove all doubt!	5.0	Compelling action and drama	2000-11-28	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2UF97B57Q2YCE	Erin	You wouldn't think so from the title and the expected action and fight scenes, but this is a beautiful epic.  The love story behind it is lovely but bittersweet. Ridley Scott makes the characters come to life and he makes ancient Rome come to life. Now, I am a teenage girl.  I went to see Gladiator with my friend for two reasons: 1) extra credit in Latin IV, 2) Russell Crowe.  By the end of the movie, I had forgotten the extra credit, but I hadn't forgotten Russell Crowe.  He is marvelous.  I was wary of the fighting, I didn't want to see all the gore. Okay, there is some gore, but nothing I couldn't handle.  The first battle scene is amazing.  When the Barbarians are heard rallying in the woods, it sent chills down my spine, it still does when I watch it on DVD.  So, for the boys: you'll love it for the fight scenes.  For the ladies: Russell Crowe, he needs no further explanation.	2.0	From a Woman's Perspective	2000-12-29	6	3	3
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3K77198CXHGDE	Erix	"&quot;Gladiator&quot; could just as easily have been a bad film. When was the last time we even heard of a movie about gladiators? Hadn't it become a joke? ""Do you like movies about gladiators?"" Isn't that what Peter Graves, playing a perverted airline pilot, asks a ten-year-old boy in the first reel of &quot;Airplane&quot;? Sword and sandal epics had become a Hollywood terror. There was &quot;Ben Hur&quot; and &quot;Spartacus&quot;, but then Italy stuck their profiteering fingers in the pie and gave us a parade of terrible films that would forever disgrace the genre... Until now.Ridley Scott, though skeptical at first, decided to take upon himself the challenge of crafting an old-fashioned epic that would enthrall audiences in the same manner that those aforementioned classics did. And he succeeded. &quot;Gladiator&quot; is, honest to God, Scott's best film since &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. It's also his first major blockbuster.And, man, does it DELIVER! It offers a grand spectacle as well as a classically structured tale about honor and heroism. Few films can get away with being so, well, masculine. Scott's handling of the battle scenes is terrific. They are electric, exciting and oh so very bloody. Egad! What a thrilling mess! Shot with elegance and adorned by a wonderful musical score (by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard). And then you have the cast. Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, the ailing Caesar of Rome, about to appoint a successor to his throne. But it wont be his rather amoral and conniving son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). There is also Oliver Reed in his final performance as the slave trader Proximo. Reed brings such flavor and character to his supporting role, that he nearly walks away with the picture. It's a grand and eloquent swan song performance that reminds us all of what a great actor he was and how much poorer we are for losing him. It's really too bad that he had plummeted into near obscurity before this. &quot;Gladiator&quot; would have made for an exquisite comeback.In other key supporting roles - BBC favorite Derek Jacobi as a just Roman senator, Connie Nielsen as Commodus's benign and stronger-than-she-seems sister and Djimon Hounsou (who made such an impact in Spielberg's underrated &quot;Amistad&quot;.) as a noble gladiator.  This is a very well-rounded cast. And at the center of it all is the star- Russell Crowe, one of the most exciting actors to appear in the last decade, proving once and for all that he can carry a picture. As Maximus, he delivers a performance of great richness and depth. This is a classic hero that you really want to root for, and Crowe has a gift for communicating his inner pain. He has been disgraced, his family has been murdered. He wants vengeance, but he also wants to set things right for Rome in the process. I love the little nuances that he brings to the role. The way he rubs sand in his hands before each battle (a detail that was not in the script). All great stuff. With his ruggedness and everyman qualities, Crowe could end up being a Harrison Ford-type role model for a whole new generation of young moviegoers. But, in difference to Ford, Crowe has proven to be more of a risk taker. Playing diverse roles in less commercial films.You really can't ask for a meatier and more satisfying blockbuster. The screenplay gives its characters plenty of grand melodramatic dialogues. Particularly the scenes given to Phoenix. If Crowe is the star, then Phoenix is the breakout success of this film. Here we have a young actor who walks in the shadow of his late brother River Phoenix. But you want to know my opinion? Joaquin is a richer, more complex actor than his brother ever was. It isn't easy to portray a villain like this. Instead of going for the easy way out and making him an out-and-out baddie, he makes him a complex and tragic figure. An ambitious young man who is riddled with insecurities and deep down only wants to be accepted. And his whispery delivery of key dialogues makes him menacing yet sympathetic.&quot;Gladiator&quot; may not be perfect. I mean, that melodrama can get a bit overbearing at times. And it makes for a couple of unwanted lulls when the film should just keep moving. But overall, Scott has put the whole package together so well, that one way or another you get caught up in this little Roman soap opera whether you like it or not. One might want to argue at the complete historical accuracy of it all. But it feels pretty real. And watching those battles, I couldn't help but make a connection to Wrestlemania... Think about it. These gladiators were in fact star athletes weren't they? The film's way of handling that aspect of the story is so infectious, that by the time Maximus shouts at the coliseum: ""Are you not entertained?"" one almost feels like cheering right along with the crowd.The spectacular box office success of this film makes one think that there just might be hope out there for quality enterainments. I mean, vapid idiocy can be good for a laugh sometimes, but movies shouldn't always be mere products."	5.0	Deriving Greatness From A Punchline	2001-01-05	3	3	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A19U7GWZHNF1XM	"""fenixmxpx"""	I was about to start cheering with the crowd during this movie.  Thats how good it was.  For all you that DON'T know, this is an excellent movie.  It takes place in ancient Rome, during Marcus Aurelias' rule.  The movie begins at the beginning of a great war scene.  Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the general of the Romans, and he and his army triumph.  The opposing side has their soldiers sent to crucify Maximus's son and wife.  When he returns, he finds his family dead, his house burned, and he just falls to the ground.  He is later captured, and turned into a slave, thrown into fights to the death only to please fans.  These fight scenes that Maximus fights in are AMAZING and very real at the same time.  No Matrix-esque effects here.  All real.  Very violent, but entertaining nonetheless.  Decapitation, dismemberment, etc.  It's all here.  It's what makes Gladiator a great movie.  I won't tell any more of the story, you'll have to see it yourself.  Make it a must.  The acting is superb, the storyline/script is amazing and is actually TRUE, and it perfectly delineates what went on in ancient Rome.  Gladiator will make you laugh, cry, fear, etc.  It sends you through endless states of emotion.  It's THAT good.  Although the one part I found disgusting was the fact that Commidus was in love with his sister.  But it follows the true story, so I'll let it slide.  Note: This movie is not for the queezy!  Many gory scenes are explicitly shown, so be prepared.  Go buy this movie.  You will nto be dissapointed.  AT ALL.	5.0	Maximus! Maximus!	2000-12-21	5	1	4

The first battle scene of the movie, where Rome is ready to end it's long battle and defeat and concur Germania is absolutely beautiful.  Mr. Scott leaves you is aw as the archers launch hundreds of flaming arrows through the sky on that cold winter dawn.  It was one of the most beautiful scenes of this movie.  The presence of leadership in Russell Crows character as well as his love for his family is definitely felt through out the entire film.Ridley Scotts' performance in selecting Hans Zimmer as the composer of the score for this film must be commended.  Music is definitely one of the most important keys in the telling of any story.  Hans Zimmer has composed for many films, but the music in this particular movie touches the audience and completes the task the director set out to do. The audience will absolutely loose them selves in this fantastic story.I rated this film with five stars for many reasons. The cinematography, the music, the story line, and the acting. I am completely satisfied.  If you are a fan of Mel Gibsons &quot;Brave Heart&quot; you will not want to miss this movie. I truly believe that if after seeing a movie, if I posses a desire to learn more about actual events similar to those in the film, than the director has done an excellent job and deserves all the recognition in world.If you haven't seen this movie, take a chance, you won't regret it.	5.0	Destined to become an epic	2000-11-27	2	2	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3CWH6VKCTJAD	"""flickjunkie"""	"""Gladiator"" is one of those rare blockbusters that actually lives up to the hype.  Produced in the mold of old fashioned Hollywood epics like Ben-Hur, Cleopatra and Spartacus, this film was every bit as spectacular as they used to make them in the heyday of the studios.  With a lavish budget and an eye for detail, director Ridley Scott (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""GI Jane"") combines the splendor of ancient Rome (brought to life in stunning detail through awesome, computer generated visual effects) with a human story of gripping intensity, to create one of the most complete entertainment experiences I can remember in quite some time.The story involves the fall from grace of Maximus, a famous general of the Northern Army whom Marcus Aurelius favors over his own son for succession to the throne.  When Marcus dies before making this wish known, his son Commodus is elevated and orders Maximus killed.  Maximus escapes his executioners, but is taken as a slave and turned into a Gladiator.  This sets up a dramatic confrontation between Maximus and Commodus in the Roman Coliseum.This is an ingenious meld of fantasy and reality that plays fast and loose with historical fact.  Marcus Aurelius was, in fact, a roman Caesar during the period in question.  His portrayal as a kind and thoughtful leader was accurate.  He would come to be known historically as the ""Philosopher King"" and the ""Benevolent Dictator"".  He was also a great military leader and conqueror.  Commodus was altered considerably from historical accounts, but the essence of his evil and egocentric personality was well represented.  By historical accounts, Commodus was fair and blond.  He was not the sniveling brat who avoided battle as he was portrayed.  In fact, he fought by his father's side for the last five years of Marcus Aurelius' life.  Nor was he passed over by his father for succession.  Marcus was proud of Commodus and named him Caesar at the age of five.  He publicly named him as his successor at seventeen.It is universally accepted that Marcus Aurelius died of plague in March of 180 A.D. and not as depicted in the film.  There is no historical record of any general named Maximus.  Commodus died in a carefully planned coup d'etat, strangled in his bath by a gladiator named Narcissus.  This is also at odds with events depicted in the film.Despite these inaccuracies, much of this film maintained a great deal of historical authenticity.  Commodus did indeed cease the conquering wars and focused on gaining favor with ""the mob"", a derisive term used by the Patricians to describe the masses.  He would give away food and other gifts and hold extensive games to keep them amused.  He was also wildly popular for personally fighting gladiators in the arena, just as depicted.  He was a ruthless dictator, who had numerous attempts made on his life, and he routinely had Senators and other enemies executed.  His was a reign of terror and debauchery that rivaled that of Caligula.The most impressive feat of historical authenticity was the computer generated views of Ancient Rome.  These were done in meticulous detail and consistent with what is know from records and ruins.  The costumes were also precise and authentic, as were the battle tactics seen in the opening battle.  This film brings Ancient Rome to life in a way that is more realistic than ever before.The story was a cross between the story of Commodus and the story of Spartacus.  Spartacus was a roman soldier who deserted and who was taken into slavery, later becoming a gladiator and then the leader of a slave uprising against Rome.  (For those who enjoyed ""Gladiator"" and have never seen ""Spartacus"" starring Kirk Douglas, I highly recommend that you dig it out of the rental stacks.)This film was a directorial masterpiece.  Though the battles were intense, the graphic violence was understated without losing effect.  Scott uses strobe photography to intensify the battle scenes rather than showing a great deal of gore.  Scott chose to emphasize the human story, binding us to Maximus emotionally through excellent character development.  This is a classic struggle of good against evil that turned the viewer into a devoted member of the Roman mob.  It is a story that hooks you and doesn't let you go.  Scott understood the importance of this and made sure that the human story didn't get lost in the spectacle.The acting was superb.  Russell Crowe is becoming bigger than life as a box office attraction, and with good reason.  His performance was awesome, offering both physical and emotional prowess.  Joaquin Phoenix was also deliciously evil as the self tormented Commodus.  This breakout performance for Phoenix is Oscar worthy in a supporting role.  At seventy years old, Richard Harris dusted himself off for yet another powerful supporting role as Marcus Aurelius.The sound on the DVD was excellent and it included an entire second disk of extras, including an interesting featurette on the making of the film.  It was enjoyable to have an opportunity to see another side of Russell Crowe.  He always plays such dour characters that it is fun to see him continually mugging for the camera and telling jokes.  It is refreshing to see that after all the fame he has enjoyed, he doesn't take himself at all seriously.This film was off the rating charts.  I deducted two points for historical inaccuracies and still gave it a 10/10.  They don't make films like this anymore.  Don't miss it."	5.0	An epic masterpiece that lives up to the hype.	2000-12-03	17	15	2

""People who have enjoyed this movie in its short form, they're going to like the hell out of this.""The new-to-DVD extras sprawl across discs 2 and 3. Among the best is a new documentary that, unbelievably, rarely drags over its three-hour running time. A must-see chapter is ""The Heat of the Battle,"" about staging the warfare. It captures director Scott making battlefield decisions: ""I need something really brutal. Chop his f---ing head off.""A 25-minute segment covers the curious tale of Oliver Reed, who died three weeks before the end of production. The visual effects team shows how their digital resurrection of the actor averted $26 million in reshoots. Reed talks about the film on-set, looking hardy and engaged.Widescreen visuals on a DreamWorks test disc were first-rate, as they were on the first DVD, released in 2000. The aspect ratio is 2.35:1. Alas, the generous audio options on the original disc, such as DTS ES, have been reduced to a Dolby Digital 5.1 track."	4.0	'Gladiator' wins again	2005-08-02	13	11	2

However, Bestbuy had this and Braveheart on sale for 22.99 each and you saved ten bucks if you bought both, so thats 35.98 before tax for two new realease.  So I rolled the dice since my DVD copy was lost sometime last year when I moved.  I have to same I am quite impressed by the quality of the Blu-Ray.In some reviews I've read the arrows are missing from the battle, I assure you they are not, I can't say that every single arrow is there since I never have counted them before, but they are there.  Also the detail in the picture and the sound are great.Will there be another release?  Who knows, and if it does happen it probably won't happen for awhile so if you want it on Blu-Ray I say get it.  Also another added bonus, if you still have your DVD copy you get a rebate form where they will send you 10 bucks back for mailing in your new recent along with both proof of purchases.	4.0	Don't listen to the hate, this is a fantastic release!	2009-09-03	7	3	4

Some background information is good but when there is an abundance like this set, stand back and enjoy the ride. This 2 DVD set is absolutely a marvel to watch.  Here special effects are used to show us the Rome we have only seen in lavicious paintings. Now we can be absorbed into the plot and character roles without distraction from poor effects.  The story line and actors chosen for this epic were excellent choices.  I just want to say watch this movie (Disk 1 uninterrupted for almost 3 hours) then watch the 2nd Disk; the deleted scenes (adds to the story line/plot immensely), the making of, and the real Gladitor Story (an amazing tale).  With all this information return to review the movie once again for an entirely new perspective.  If you liked Spartacus (1960) you'll love &quot;The Gladitor&quot; (2000).  You'll be watching this movie again.  A great addition to the DVD library.	5.0	DVD's FOREVER - view, examine ALL the extras, then review	2000-12-15	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3IKBHODOTYYHM	"fra7299 ""fra7299"""	"What I have noticed is that the grand scale of epics has diminished mostly in the past ten years. Seldom does a film successfully balance action, emotion, power, scenery into one cohesive story. Gladiator is that one blockbuster hit that is larger than life, yet scales back its grandness to let you experience Maximus' story, his rise and fall, personal tragedies, and triumphs. What Ridley Scott ""gets"" is that a film of this magnitude shouldn't just be gore, action, violence and the battles of benevolent and corrupt forces, with one side prevailing. There should also be pathos and emotion, glimpses into character perspective, and larger themes explored.Gladiator exposes the nature of corruptness in those who hold high ranking positions, as Commodus' (Joaquin Phoenix) lust for power and popularity knows no bounds. There's a sense of mob mentality in the Roman crowd, with their allegiances for or against him changing on a whim. Knowing he can manipulate the masses with bloodshed and entertainment, Commodus is able to play this hand well. At the other spectrum, Gladiator also illustrates the importance of loyalty as a means of living an honorable life, echoed in Maximus' statement: ""What we do in life, echoes in eternity.""  Maximus is sort of microcosm of the past ideals, with successful, powerful but just rulers in charge. Brought down to low status, Maximus attempts to survive in his new found role as Gladiator, while restoring some order in Rome.There are many things about this production that are top notch: great casting and performances by its stars, a wonderful music score and scenery, epic gladiator battles, just a larger than life epic atmosphere.If there was one slight annoyance, it was that Commodus was a bit too over the top in his villainy. It seemed like most characters were well-developed, but his just was a little too one dimensional.Still, Gladiator is an awesome viewing experience, one of those films that draws you into its story. It's one of those films you can come back with repeated viewings.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ACVNA57PI4DLV	Francois Tremblay	"Russell Crowe in another role - he is boffed up, but still brings the same doggedness and humanity to this roles. It is good to see him in a role where his character is competent. Gladiator is the story of one General Maximus, whom the Caesar wants to appoint instead of his own son. As the son, Commodus, kills his father, Maximus is threatened by death as he refuses to follow him. He is captured and becomes a gladiator, with only one purpose - revenge.If anything, Gladiator is a clever fable against democracy and the masses, who are represented by the throngs of Rome who seek ""bread and games"". They can be made to cheer for the death of thousands and thousands - like people today cheer at movies depicting the War on Drugs, and foreign wars. They can be pacified by bread and games, while corrupt individuals manipulate the power around them to gain material riches, and the Republic (the rule of law, the US Constitution) is crumbling.Unfortunately it is also a story about gladiators, and therefore about plentiful gratuitous violence. I'm afraid I can't stomach that, but if you can, then you must see Gladiator (that is, if you missed it the first time). It is yet another movie that teaches basic lessons of life that are yet to be learned by most people, because we now value blissfull ignorance more than being civilized."	4.0	Gratuitous violence and unnecessary shots	2003-05-11	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2MF338Q12XI3H	Frank Bierbrauer	Even the opening credits capture you the moment you see them with the haunted music of a dying empire as the title appears and the opening scene of Russel Crowe as the long suffering contemplative general, every nuance of his face describes his stricken life full of the hard gruesome days fighting barbarians for the last 12 years. So starts one of the greatest films I have seen, with these scences you are caught up immediately in the tale of a great man. Strangely enough the supremely beautiful scene where Maximus the general watches a bird alight on a branch is never mentioned by reviewers, considering its eloquence and almost zen-like aside as life continues in the most horror filled times. The battle scenes are incredible with the full might of the supremely trained and confident Roman army unleashing hell as Crowe put it in the film, such terror the barbarians must have felt being crushed under foot by the superior technological ability of the Romans. The film does not dwell on this but rather fully encapsulates the viewer within the fight scenes as man battles man. Maximus's decline as general in the political battles taking place for Emperorship fling him into slavery and to fight as a gladiator, at every moment Maximus remains human never becoming too much of a hero but staying vulnerable and yet noble and loyal with great strength of character, the sort of man other men would love and follow into battle or anywhere else for that matter. The death of Maximus at the end allows real tears to be shed for a great man indeed. An incredible experience, more than a film. Only &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; has done this better.	5.0	incredible just incredible	2000-10-08	10	8	2

The Battle tactics They us at the Start of the Movie against the Germanic Tribe looks like an actual startegy they would use at that time and the acting was convincing. All of this is really impressive, But When you will see this movie you will think imediatly of Brave Heart, without breaking the story to others, similar events in the main characters life happen. Which you will find decieving. They should of added different twists, and fixed the plot to be Different. Then Everyone would of Enjoyed it Much More! The Movie was also too long, they should of made it a little shorter but it's just a tiny detail no big deal.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1MOU3809JZKMJ	"Frank Ravizza ""AMZN Junkie"""	"Most reviewers seem to point out the edge enhancement (EE) and noise reduction as the primary issues with this Blu-ray release of this modern historical epic that has become a classic. After viewing, I've concluded that may not be the entire story. It looks to me like the source film scan may have been lower resolution, perhaps coming from a previous DVD release. The aim of the EE, which is an unsharp mask filter, is to increase visual acuity, or the perceived resolution. This is okay when there is resolution there to enhance, but the film does not seem to have the resolution you'd expect from high bitrate HD, and appeared more like up sampled DVD. Throw on top of that noise reduction, which can destroy details in the process of hiding noise, and you have a heavily compromised image. In addition, the colors and contrast were not very 'punchy'. Overall the image seemed muted and stale, I've seem better HD images on Comcast.My playback set-up is a Mitsubishi 73"" DLP on PC with the best available hardware and software. It could be that I've become spoiled by modern releases such as The Dark Knight and Transformers 2, both of which look absolutely jaw dropping on a DLP. But I don't believe that's the answer because I've seen much older films released on Blu-ray that look excellent, Goodfellas for example (on HD-DVD). Additionally, the sound track seemed heavily compressed on my 2-channel set-up. I'd describe the sound as `dead'. The dialog was muddy and the LFE track was nonexistent.The only redeeming quality of this release is the film itself, which was just as superb as I remembered it. This was the first time I've seen the extra scenes. I felt they changed the flow of the film and compromised the plot on several points. The scene where Commodus takes a sword to a marble sculpture of his father Marcus Aurelius stood out for me. This emotional outburst showed commodious as even more physiologically weak than I remember, nearly to the point where he is sympathetic. Another scene that stood out was the execution of two Praetorian guardsman when Commodus manipulates General Quintus into giving the execution order in spite of his pleas to spare the accused traitors. This scene changed my perception of Quintis. Why did he suddenly decide to support his former friend Maximus in the final scene where Maximus fights Commodus when he could have over thrown him on several previous occasions? Who does Quintis really stand behind? Is he a moral character; or merely a soldier following orders? Does he fight for Rome, or does he fight for the emperor? Overall, I understand why these scenes were cut in the interest of time for an already lengthy film. They do fill in some holes and add some interesting details to the film and were worth watching, but subtract from the plot as much as they add.In summary, don't buy this Blu-ray release. If you're a big fan of the film, and want to see it on Blu-ray, I would recommend renting this and buying a later release that will hopefully be much better."	2.0	Blu-ray release does not live up to the film	2010-01-10	10	8	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	"Having had this film on standard dvd it was worth the upgrade to blu-ray to get both the Thearetical and Extended releases and the special feature documentaries.  I didn't get the ""remastered"" version and being based in Singapore it means it's difficult to get a replacement but truth be told, I didn't even notice the ""imperfections"" until I was told about them and until then I was quite happy with the overall much improved picture and sound quality over the standard dvd that I originally had.  The opening war scene sounded excellent in the DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround mode for example and the 1080p definition made the picture quality the best I had ever seen it.  Ridley Scott in the introduction to the extended version makes it clear that it is not the Director's cut which he says is still the thearetical version however my personal preference is for the extended version which I feel does make the film a little better and the actions of the cast a little more understandable.  The greatness of this film comes from an excellent script coupled with excellent performances from a great cast and other than the principal actors special mention should be made for Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi's roles as well; old-timers who can still effortlessly steal the show.Do contact customer service first if you want to get the remastered version which is something I would have done had I known about the issue in advance but as far as this still being a great movie that looks and sounds even better in 1080p and DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround with two versions of the film there is no doubt.Still recommended!"	4.0	"This Century's ""Spartacus"" A Film of Epic Proportions!"	2011-12-16	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2VE83MZF98ITY	"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick"""	Having been brought up in the classics, naturally anything that has to do with ancient Greece or Rome will catch my attention. Whether it holds it for very long or not is another matter; fortunately, Gladiator, for all of its shortcomings, did.This is a work of fiction, and must be approached as such. I have seen numerous reviews that criticise the film for its lack of authenticity and historicity -- this is perhaps an unfair criticism. It is as unfair as if to say Star Wars is unhistorical, or the events portrayed on Spin City didn't really happen historically -- of course they didn't. This is what fiction is all about. Of course, there will be some grounding in reality (do we really want to divorce fiction completely from reality so that every city becomes Metropolis and every proper name must be changed?). Once I realised that this movie was intended to be a work of fiction, and not a dramatically-charged documentary, I relaxed and had an enjoyable time.There was an emperor Marcus Aurelius, who was rather effective in a Machiavellian way early in his reign, and later turned to a more philosophical bent; his collected thoughts have been published in many forms, including as part of the great Harvard set of great thinkers. His son Commodus did in fact succeed him, though not after suffocating him on the German frontier, and was an emperor of a fair inferior stamp; he played to the mob, not necessarily more than previous emperors had (and, in fact, Marcus Aurelius had not suspended the games in Rome--no wise ruler would risk such a thing), but rather more than the elite classes of Rome would prefer.Commodus in fact had (as did many emperors before and after) love affairs with relatives, friends, and strangers. He was ruthless (this much the movie kept true), but not quite as clever at intrigue as even the movie (in which he finally gets his come-uppance) suggests.The character of Maximus is a complete fiction. An honourable man for whom Semper Fi would be the appropriate appellation; he is charged by his beloved emperor Marcus Aurelius essentially to save the empire and restore the Republic (how odd that he receives assistance from a character played by Derek Jacobi, who played the Republican-minded Claudius in I, Claudius); alas, the end of the film leads one to believe that with the death of Commodus, the Republic will be restored.The Republic was never restored. The Empire fell, and anarchy took its place. The Dark Ages in the West ensued, and the Eastern Empire became the Byzantine Empire, leading a decadent and slowly-crumbling existence for another thousand years.But, heroic tales owe nothing to political realities (as most who discern the truth behind modern political campaigning will inform you!) -- this is a tale of honour and the triumph against great odds of virtue.Russell Crowe does an admirable job as Maximus, the Spaniard general turned slave by betrayal, who finally wins his dignity back in the arena in Rome. Joaquin Phoenix does an interesting job as Commodus, both weak and manipulative while being determined and ruthless. Derek Jacobi turns in his usual good acting job, though perhaps he is the wasted element in this film.The cinematography is choppy, particularly in the battle sequences; this is, I am sure, meant to convey the disarray and distraction of battle. I am not sure it succeeds. The dream sequences and 'floating' periods are rather strange, with camera trickery more akin to a music video than an epic film. There are some very well done pieces, though, including the use of colouration to show vibrancy or gloom on the well-done modeling of Rome and the Colloseum.The battle sequences that open the film are well done and realistic with regard to tactics and conditions of the Roman fight against the Germanic tribes. Unlike movies like Spartacus, which highlight some of the marching tactics, or Cleopatra, which shows use of the turtle formation, but do so in relative isolation from surrounding conditions, in Gladiator we get both a sense of the discipline and tactics of the Roman army as well as the difficult conditions under which they were fighting. As one Marine commentator told me, the Romans were often outnumbered by the ferocious Germans, but the discipline and battle tactics of the Romans usually won out because there was unit cohesion and command structure that looked at the larger battle as a whole; whereas the Germans at this period were independent, individual warriors who each, while brave and fierce, saw himself as a leader, and thus did not work together. The Celts often had the same problem.Of course, on the other hand, there were bits of reality that were omitted from the film -- gladiators did indeed become superstars in Rome, more popular than the rulers (of course, that situation happens in modern times, too, where athletes and film stars are often far more popular than political leaders). Gladiators went so far as to endorse products and do much that modern celebrities do, but this was considered 'over the top', and left out of the screenplay.Some judicious editing might make this a great film; as it is, it is a very good film, one that sets a new standard in what was considered a dead (or at least comatose) film genre.	5.0	Semper Fi in Antiquity	2003-07-21	2	2	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3NF7KWLQZ4EJI	Gabriel	Not for a long time have we been spectators to an epic film... Gladiator brought us back into the realm of our past, and I loved it for that.  It brought us back to the tremendous Roman Empire, to the command of a General, fighting for his Ceasar, his Empire, his Rome... However, like always things take a turn for the worst, and the General is outcast by the Thrown's heir, mourns for loved ones past, forced into slavery and regains a sword to revenge, in the form of the crowd.  The story is a moving and stunning one, providing a good backbone to the film.The backbone is supported with an incredible array of images and scenes, (for example the breathtaking flaming arrows flying high over the battle field, in the opening scene) with amazing special effects transporting us back into the world of Rome, the world of an Empire... its lavish and ornate theatres, games and lives.Russell Crowe had caught my attention in 'L.A. Confidential', but secured it with this.  As the General, slave, and gladiator, Crowe stands his ground next to some true cinema legends, and I was impressed with his performance.  Joaquin Phoenix also delivers well, and brings our attention back to the whinny, creepish badies, thursty for power and unattained glory.  The British legends are drawn upon... with the likes of Richard Harris, as the aging Ceasar, who I'm pleased to see back on the big screen likewise with the late Oliver Reed, as the freed Gladiator, following a distinctive absence of their work.  To me this will always be Reed's film, and although not his finest hour (with contenders like The Three Musketeers), it is certainly up there with the best; Harris said that this would have revived Reed's career, he may have been right... I will always remember him for this, the crowd will remember.  Director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner/Alien) adds a rung to his ladder with this masterpiece of cinema, reaffirming him as one of Britain's best directors.The film can boast a multitude of awards under its belt, especially in regards to the Oscars, which I must admit being disappointed that it didn't carry away a few more...The Gladiator DVD 2 disc, is among the top ten DVDs of all time, in terms of its picture and sound quality.  With superb extensive extras to match, the likes I have not seen since the DVD release of 'Bridge On The River Kwai'.  The documentaries cover all areas of production, and invites you back into the world of Rome through the eyes of a spectator, a spectator in the crowd... It won me.	5.0	Gladiator brings the term Epic, back to the screen.	2001-05-19	4	2	2

Although it was a little bit better than I expected, I too often found myself pulled out of the experience of the movie by distracting artifacts or what looks like excessive digital processing.

But the reality and facts of ancient history, is a constant reminder of brutality and no empathy towards one self and others. Previous movies made about Roman Empire and other places in the ancient world, always portray the personality of a hero with no credible knowledge of his/her livelihood. In this case - Gladiator - we feel what a strategic man is experiencing in a brutal environment. We see his dreams, honor and struggle in balancing the rationale of right and wrong. At the same time, unlike other movies, we feel sympathetic towards the bad guy too. Most of us feel happy when the bad guy looses the battle. But in this case the director cleverly portrays the personality of the bad guy by revealing his articulate thoughts, fears and the dreams of grandeur. It makes you feel sorry that he chose a twisted path in life.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AVG8LM0ELD4IV	Garrick Bergh	Back in the late 50's and early 60's Hollywood tended to churn out one major epic per year. Usually they were historically based pieces and often featured Charlton Heston in the starring role.To his credit Ridley Scott has taken the simplest of stories and, aided by modern technology, has produced a thundering good movie in the best tradition of Ben Hur.It is a long time since moviemakers visited this genre but it has been worth the wait.If the box office success is any guide then, quite clearly, the events portrayed in the movie have not lost their appeal. We may lay claim to civilization but find the prospect of recreational bloodletting just as appealing as 'the mob' which frequented the Circus Maximus.The serial killer is dead!

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2CQOIO3AKWYBY	"""garthmaul"""	I'm so glad Hollywood is moving towards releasing DVDs so soon after the movie is released. In fact, you could probably still catch this movie at your local 24 screen theater (It's currently November 14th, 2000), and it's worth the theatrical experience.  At any rate, although the movie is fairly long, you'll be on the edge of your seat for the vast majority of the movie. Crowe does a great job of looking mean, hurt, and angry whenever he has to. True, it's a little graphic, but you've got to expect that. Buy this movie, then if it's not too late, go watch it in the theaters.	5.0	Father to a murdered son...husband to a murdered wife...	2000-11-14	0	0	0

Maximus is then enslaved , and eventually becomes Rome's most popular and undefeated gladiator.Russel Crowe gives a sterling performance as Maximus , and Joaquin Phoenix skilfully plays the evil Commodus.Connie Nielsen plays the Commidus' beautiful sister Lucillus.Panoramic historical imagery and rivetting action scenes , together with an involved plot and intrigue make this a historical drama not to be missed.	5.0	Historical drama not to be missed	2006-04-25	12	2	10

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1SUZD4MN5ZZ08	George Eberling	&quot;Gladiator&quot; is the best film for 2000.  Expect it garnish a slew of awards next March at the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Special Effects, Best Music, Best Sound and Best Cinematography.  It contains many Shakespearean elements like betrayal, tragedy, love, and revenge.  Look for it on Oscar night.  It contains some of the best epic fight scenes in cinematic history.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A30HRYL6JL4GAX	George J.A. Murray, III	One reviewer described _Gladiator_ as 'one of the best movies ever,' and adds that 'if you liked _Braveheart_, you'll love this movie!'  That ought to tell you everything you need to know.  I will never cease to be amazed at the amount of praise that was heaped on this movie.  The story dragged on and on; historical verity was pure Hollywood, so far as I could tell; and nothing seemed so important as pretty scenery and luminous cinematographic effects.  Finally, the dialogue was nothing short of embarrassing--towards the end, my friend and I gave up all efforts to conceal our laughter.  Neither Crowe's bedrock solidity nor Joaquin Phoenix' Fiennes-like homoerotic flamboyance could save this film (check out the latter's 'busy little bee' tirade).  If you *must* see this film, get extremely high first--your critical faculties will require dulling in order to get through it.	1.0	millions spent on fx, hundreds spent on story development	2001-01-23	18	6	12
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1X47U1QYK50OE	George Mallone	Thousands of flaming arrows dancing across the sky. Dangerous and gory swordfights against man and beast inside a splendidly recreated Colliseum, itself inside a Rome brought back to the old grandeur of the Empire, pomp and pageantry and cheering Colliseum-goers and all. These are just a few of the arresting images to be found within Gladiator, the epic story of Roman general Maximus (Russell Crowe), a man whose incorrigible integrity and honesty display themselves at the wrong place and time, namely stepping on the toes of soon-to-be-Emperor Commodus's (Joaquin Phoenix) ascension to power. Set to be executed, Maximus manages to escape, only to be captured again, this time sold into slavery. Fighting his way up the ranks so to speak, he fights for a chance to enter the Colliseum, and strike back at Commodus, for vengeance, for honor, and for Rome.Sound like the stuff of epics? It is indeed. Some have chided its simple storyline, forgetting that a movie with a simple storyline, if it's well-acted (Phoenix's Commodus was especially good, just the perfect combination of whiny dependence and power-mad incestous insanity necessary to create a believable, and quite hateable villain) , well-directed (by the brilliant Ridley Scott), and well-scored (by Hans Zimmer, currently of Pearl Harbor fame), is a good movie nonetheless.Some have chided its historical inaccuracies, forgetting that the intent here was not to make a History Channel documentary. And this is not an attack on History Channel documentaries (they really ARE fascinating). But Scott's intent was obviously not to make such. His intent here was to tell a rousing, romantic, one might say &quot;old-school&quot; epic of a hero fighting for love, honor, and country. And at that he succeeds splendidly. So if you can overlook the historical inaccuracies, and the relatively simple storyline, be prepared for an unabashedly heroic film done with all the splendor Hollywood can muster. And hopefully you too will join the cheering of the countless Gladiator fans shouting &quot;Maximus! Maximus!&quot;A sidenote: the DVD version is wonderful. Two discs, one with the movie (done with excellent visual quality, especially when viewed on a quality widescreen), one with fascinating extra features on the making of the movie, and the history of the Gladiatorial games, make this a package worth owning.	5.0	Maximus!

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1VFKMHY42W2O3	"George R Dekle ""Bob Dekle"""	The three best movie depictions of hand-to-hand combat with edged weapons are &quot;Ran,&quot; &quot;Braveheart,&quot; and &quot;Gladiator.&quot;  &quot;Ran&quot; is most lyrical, &quot;Braveheart&quot; most personal, and &quot;Gladiator&quot; most panoramic. Each captures a different feel for masses of men madly hacking at each other.I'm certainly no expert on the subject, but &quot;Gladiator's&quot; weaponry and armor seem to be as accurate as possible.  Roman field pieces included both onagers (rock throwers) and catapults (arrow shooters).  The gladius (short sword) was right on.  The pilum (javelin)looked authentic enough.  The helmets and body armor match up pretty well with illustrations from the history books.  The array of the Germanic troops seemed accurate enough, but I believe some liberties were taken with Roman battle array and maneuver.  I'm not so sure that Greek Fire was used as early as Marcus Aurelius.As for the story itself, Maximus proved the perfect hero: competent, courageous, and committed.  He had physical strength, skill with weaponry, and was a sagacious commander.  He had the martial courage to face an enemy in mortal combat, the material courage to fight through physical adversity, and the moral courage to say &quot;No&quot; to a capricious, all powerful Emperor.  He was committed to his family, his moral code, and his country.  The mix of courage and commitment lead him to murderous conflict with the mad Emperor Commodus, resulting in a dramatically satisfying but historically inaccurate denouement.The story would have been greatly improved with a little more judicious use of the scissors.  It needed to be about 30 minutes shorter.	5.0	Authentic Weaponry--Awesome Cinematography--Alright Story	2001-10-10	1	1	0

Scott deserves an oscar for direction for this film. Especialy for the battle between the Roman army and German tribes at the begining (with out doubt as realistic as the Private Ryan battle scenes).But it is the acting and story that really shine every actor and actress put in a good performance but both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix deserve best actor and supporting actor respectively. Crowe as the stalwart loyal General to his Emperor and how is betrayed and imprisoned to become a gladiator while yearning for Vengance for the death of his Faimly. While Phoenix is a detestble villian who you can hate but also feel sorry for and understand why does what he does as a man who yearns for his Farthers Love. While the story is well written with no cliches or poor dialouge like other films while the ending although sad is also brilliant.There is nothing wrong with this fim and if Scott does not walk away with best director and Crowe with best actor and Phoenix with best Supporting actor it would be robbery.	5.0	Quite simply a master piece of Film making	2000-09-28	0	0	0

But I hope that those of you in that category can get over it, because Gladiator is a wonderful movie. It is by far the best movie of the year, possibly even the past few years. From all angles it is superb, from costume design and musical score to special effects and the sets, and the cinematography as well. The acting is fantastic. Even lesser characters turn in finely tuned performances. Russell Crowe deserves an award for his portrayal of Maximus, the honorable ex-general who must fight his way to freedom and revenge. But Joaquin Phoenix steals the show as the insecure, shiftless emporer Commodus. He makes the new emporer a complex, multi-layered character that is very interesting. In less capable hands the part would have become a mere campy run-of-the-mill villain that would have been an insult to a movie as good as this. The movie's themes of honor and devotion are portrayed well. All of the good aspects of this movie far outweigh the violence, so I hope that you are willing to give it a chance.	5.0	An amazing epic	2000-12-21	7	6	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3C0K1UVA1CUYS	growly	This steelbook of Gladiator is as good as you can currently get.Perhaps the first two reviewers would prefer the old release of Gladiator on blu ray where so many people complained about the Digital Noise Reduction and Edge Enhancement that this remastered blu ray was produced. Perhaps they would prefer the DVD.Gladiator was shot on 35mm film. Film has grain. I much prefer to see the film grain than to view something that has been excessively processed and treated, but some people would prefer all blu rays to look like they were shot on digital HD cameras. And some people like to find fault with everything.Just look at the amazon reviews for the 'regular' Gladiator blu ray and you'll see what I mean.This steelbook rates as 5 stars. You get a two blu ray set of Gladiator, including the Theatrical version, the Extended version and a disc full of special features.  All this in a very nice steelbook package, that at the time of writing is $9.99, less than the regular 'Saphhire Series' release.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3FVL058XS3NIE	"Guillermo ""gmonk"""	I seldom write reviews for anything, but for a movie like 'Gladiator' I'm willing to make an exception, and gosh if it's worth doing it!!The movie, by far the best of the year 2000, is not only an award-winning production, but it is also one of the few that I personally enjoy watching again and again and again. Not because it is flawless (at times the storyline is quite predictable) but because it portrays life and death in the Roman Empire in such a way that it really bring those old buildings we all know since childhood (the Coliseum, the Forum, Via Appia, etc) back to life.And yet it does so not at the expense of the story but through it, from the characters, to the script (they're so many quotables lines from Maximus and Commudus alone to make a CD)...in fact everything in the movie, from the battle in Germanica to the last fight at the Coliseum, is portrayed with realism plus an amazing score lacking in so many movies these days.The movie of course is not to be seen as &quot;history&quot; in the academic sense but rather as an historical exercise, Holywood style, of one of the most facinating and complex periods of Western History. The attention to the detail is amazing, especially in the opening scene (the battle in Germanica) and the gladiatorial fights. Even most deleted scenes are great in the sense that they allow us to understand the characters a little bit more (Commudus' sword smashing of his father's marble bust is a most see), although they neither add nor take of the story. The casting is superb, with Russell Crow in the main role, Joaquin Phoenix as the Emperor Commudus, along with such legends as Oliver Reed as the freedman slaveholder and Richard Harris as the great Marcus Aurelius.I'll recomend strongly that anyone who sees this movie shoudl do his/her homework and do a little of reading about Rome, both as a Republic and after, and the huge importance of the entertaining business in her late everyday life (an importance unreached until recent times).Overall, a classic epic of an scope and ambition not seen since 'Ben Hur'; full of action, drama... and yes, more action.As the Romans themselves said, Faber est quisque fortunae suae... each one is the architect of his own fortune.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1FY8NNI6PLI4Z	Gunny Mac	First off, this is a great movie.  Its not necessarily revolutionary in any way, but it is simply pulled off so well.  The cinematography, majestic sceneries, excellent special effects and emotionally stirring music combine to create a very heartfelt and poetic film.  Its one of those films that can just totally immerse you from start to finish.  Gladiator has been accused of having a conventional storyline, but in my opinion it simply proves that the traditional formula of the hero epic can still make a great movie, as long as it is done the right way.  The actors do a superb job with their characters.  Russell Crowe wins the audience's heart with a very multi-dimensional portrayal of Maximus.  Maximus has the noble heart and steadfast strength of a true hero, yet his pain and quiet humility prove that he is still human.  The well filmed and choreographed fights convey the cruelty and chaos of battle without overly emphasizing graphic bloodshed.  Gladiator isn't ground breaking, but it is the best epic adventure film to come out in a long time and it keeps you enthralled and truly stirs your emotions.  This is what film making is all about.The DVD is definitely worth buying.  The great picture quality and sound are essential in order to make the viewer truly appreciate a movie such as this.  There are also a ton of interesting extra features such as behind the scenes looks at the making of the film, production notes, TV spots and a number of deleted scenes.  A great movie and a great value!	5.0	a classic movie...and a very satisfying DVD	2000-11-26	11	9	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2VB73LG2J633W	G. Vozzo	"I did a fair bit of homework before buying this 2-disc Blu-ray set with a January 1, 2013 release date. (Yes, Amazon's description of the set is wrong - an unfortunately common problem!) The original release of Gladiator on Blu-ray was a noise-reduction, edge-enhancement mess that has since been replaced by a much better, more film-like remaster. But how to know which print you have received? This is tricky. Some investigations in 2010 and 2011 revealed that if the back of the Blu-ray case says ""2-disc set"" over the Paramount logo, or if the UPC sticker is not yellow, or if the color of the printed side of the discs themselves is light grey, your Blu-ray print might be the bad one. However, time has shown that these indicators are not reliable.What about this new release? The copy I received today has a *white* UPC sticker on the back that says ""Distributed by Warner Home Video"" and features the WB logo. (The sole reason for the 2013 re-release, as far as I can tell, is that WB has taken over distribution of this and many other titles from Paramount.) The case features the ""2-disc set"" label and a 2010 copyright date. BUT THIS IS INDEED THE NEWER REMASTER! The principal giveaway is that the unprinted side of Disc 1 features a code along the inner ring which ends with ""B1R2."" But the only sure test is to play the movie. From the start, it has a film-like appearance that is not excessively scrubbed of grain and minor noise, but is nevertheless polished and color-corrected. It looks and sounds fantastic to me. I saw no noticeable flaws during the opening battle sequence that would suggest to me that this is the wrong print of the movie. (Hooray!) What small flaws I did notice seem to be inherent to the film and should stay as they are.I hesitated to replace my 2-disc DVD copy of this movie. I'm very glad to have this new release. It is the high-quality Sapphire Series Blu-ray release with both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film, commentary by Scott and Crowe, a vast collection of featurettes, deleted scenes, images, and more.

But anyway for me the acting, cinomatography, and etc. was perfect depicting ancient Rome. The thing I have problem with is the screenplay. It just doens't flow right. The part of Ceaser's Death almost made me fall sleep not to mention I still don't get it. And after Ceaser died the story is only about a man fighting well as a gladiator-which is very predictable. The only thing that saved this movie from my boring list is its twist ending (not telling you what it is).

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A37DLVPKJZGSQF	Hannibal	Winner of 5 Oscars including Best Picture, Gladiator is an astonishingly engaging epic spectacle with a grand action-drama genre. The action is brilliant; you get everything from gruesome killings to leaping tigers in some visual effects that look truly real, you won't even notice they are computer-generated or CGI. The drama is the heart of the movie however, the back-story is the story of a man, his love for his family, his strong abilities and his will to escape. This man is played to perfection by Russell Crowe in one of his most gritty roles to date. There is also a fantastic supporting cast - Oliver Reed, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen and Amistad's Djimon Hounsou - all give life to interesting roles. Okay, so there are lots of flaws in the editing, Joaquin's scar changing from right to left and an aeroplane crossing the arena, but, this is a movie you watch for enjoyment, not to diss the mistakes that come up, even though they do. The film also has an amazing DVD with great stills, a brilliant making of feature and a 2-disk special. Enjoy!	5.0	A grand action-drama.	2001-06-03	3	2	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A10479I6VD324D	Hans K Hess	"This is one of those rare moments when Hollywood makes an attempt at self reflection. The narrative depicts the rise to power of the ""General who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied the Emperor."" One gets the sense, though, that the film is not just talking about General Maximus but is really a loose allegory for Hollywood's political influence.This well told story is about a General who (unwillingly) becomes the Roman equivalent of a Hollywood actor (albeit without the perks).  From his new position as an entertainer, Maximus is able to carry enough political weight with the people to ultimately defeat the corrupt ruler.  To say it another way, the central motif of the movie is this: Because entertainers have access to the masses, political power is most effectively wielded as an entertainer.  And so Hollywood, as embodied in Maximus, ultimately portrays itself as the savior of democracy and presumably, therefore, the savior of mankind.Interestingly enough, Gladiator's examination of the relation between entertainment and political power comes near the end of the term of a President who has had more than the normal amount of connections to Hollywood.  One can't help but wonder about the real life connections between politics and entertainment. Perhaps the arena is not far off after all."	4.0	Hollywood Thinks About Itself	2001-01-17	3	0	3

They spent too much money on the clothes and the set to make it look &quot;realistic&quot; that they over-do it. Perhaps that's why they didn't have any money left for a real plot.

He makes us forget the world we live in for awhile and transports us into his world of gladiators and violence.Russell Crowe is the topping on this creamy pie - the one that binds it all together.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AYTV6G5C7D0AI	"""hawk1138"""	It shouldn't be necessary to say that Gladiator is a terrific epic movie. Sales continue to be high for one very good reason: it is a thrill to watch. Ridley Scott (who also directed Blade Runner, arguably the greatest science fiction movie in existance) remembers how effective a slow panning shot of a hundred flaming arrows streaking towards the enemy, or a close shot of a tiger's single swipe, can be. Crowds and long-shots of the Collesium are often computer generated, but Scott maintains a near-understatedness by focusing on a thousand extras chanting &quot;Maximus!&quot; or a recurring shot of a field of wheat for those moments of emotion. And he does it well.The acting is also above reproach. Russell crow is a powerhouse in every shot, and Joaquin Phoenix does well as an &quot;evil&quot; emporer whose faults seem at times motivated by such personal weakness (rather than cold malevolence) that we can almost sympathize with him.With a second disc of very entertaining extras, Gladiator is a must for anyone who genuinely enjoys movies.

There is a lot of action and suspense.But it's a bit too violent.The actors act very well particularly Russell Crowe.The characters are very attaching so you feel often sad.Crowe's performance is so good really because of his charisma, the way he looks and speaks. His powerful screen presence enables him to capture the audience's attention, and Maximus is really a character you can root for.Joaquin Phoenix is convincing and intelligent as Commodus, having an authoritative, commanding presence.The fact that Commodus has done and tried to do such sick and evil things makes you really hate him.Roger Ebert said that a quirkier actor might have been more fun in the role.But if there was, you probably wouldn't be able to hate Commodus as much.The old pros Jacobi, Reed, and Harris are all great, but Reed stands out in the trio, giving a splendid performance and since he appears in the film longer, his character is fleshed out more. Nielsen is fine as Commodus' sister Lucilla.Gladiator"" starts off with a bang as the Roman Legions battle Germanic hoards in the forests of Southern Germany. It is spectacularly staged, with the stoic Russel Crowe (Maximus) leading the charge and hacking away at opposing fighters.After the fight, Maximus learns from the ailing Emperor Marcus Aruelius (Harris) that he is be the Emperors' heir, and not the Emperor's son, Commadus (Phoenix).Commadus goes berserk and Maximus is forced to flee and he finds his family back home dead.In despair, he wanders aimlessly collasping in an open plain and picked up by a group of Gladiator recruiters, led by a former Gladiator named Proximo (Reed). From there, Maximus is a Gladiator fighting in pest-infested arenas, waiting for his chance to return to Rome and Commadus.So I liked it and I recommended it!"	4.0	A great historical movie!	2003-07-07	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1CZ7PH2JNRUCL	HG fan	It helps to have a smattering of historical background to fully enjoy the portrayals in this epic. Epics have historic consultants to advise the producers and directors on the periods in question and R. Scott obviously listened to his. The attention to detail is very commendable. The opening battle scenes with the Germanic tribes is laudable and quite realistic. Attention to costume and military weapons is exacting (except perhaps for the chrome helmets and swords and the 'kung fu' like handling of them), but thats hollywood entertainment... can't get away from it!Russel Crowe as the fictional Gladiator is powerful and realistic. The portrayal of Commodus is also brilliantly done. Surprisingly not much has come down to us regarding the real Commodus and most of what we do have was written after his death. He was popular with the public for his games and free bread, but pretty much despised by everyone else, so what has come down to us is believed to have a very negative bias. History tells us Commodus always wanted to be a gladiator and is suppose to have actually fought several hundred gladitorial contests in the arena before the crowds. Of course, one would guess the contests would have been 'fixed' with the winner being a foregone conclusion. However a number of his contests were against wild beasts... (lions, and tigers, and bears... oh my). It is also speculated that the beasts would have been drugged to some level, but it would be impossible to 'fix' one of those contests for a sure outcome! The point being... Commodus was brave enough to get in the arena with them in the first place. He also raced chariots in the Hippodrome (the Circus Maximus), a very dangerous sport to be sure! He regularly wore gladitorial costuming around the palace and gave important positions and money to his gladitorial and charioteer favorites.  History also states he married his sister (alluded to in the movie) and was assassinated in his palace rather than killed in the arena (a forgivable error for the plot). Joaquin Phoenix does an excellent job of portraying Commodus as unbalanced (not insane). In the movie, Commodus murders his father but it should be noted that within the royal family murder was commonplace in this period of Roman history as a means of advancing to become emperor. (His father actually died in bed of illness, but this IS a Hollywood telling of history afterall.) If you don't get yourself bogged down in the historical inaccuracies, you will really enjoy this film. The acting by all is superb.A footnote: Roman law gave the father the right to kill members of the family (particularly sons) if he was disobeyed or the family dishonored. So, life and death in Rome was looked upon with a very different perspective than we do today.	4.0	A good film....	2005-10-31	6	5	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AOPPHDPD830VJ	"Holy Olio ""holy_olio"""	"__________________I saw this twice in the theater and wanted to see it on DVD, curious about the performances. Were they as magnificent as I remembered, or was it the spectacle on the big screen? The film was a spectacle, but the impact is only slightly reduced on the small screen.The performances are towering, and the cast is excellent. This is a movie most will enjoy, particularly those who enjoyed Braveheart. I'm not particularly a Ridley Scott fan, but when the performances are great, it's the director. This is quite an achievement, particularly since it is a genre picture. While I like historical dramas, few are of this high quality, and I hope that lesser lights don't try a follow-on to the success of Gladiator.The companion disk has a behind the scenes or making of video which didn't interest me. I didn't want to spoil my experience of the movie by seeing the fakery. There is also an hour long historical supplement that is very educational. The child actor contributed a diary of his time on location, and although it took some time to get through all the pages, I found them to be amusing. The deleted scenes have alternate sound tracks provided by Ridley Scott, which was an excellent idea. It's easy to see that something needed to be cut due to the sheer length of the movie, but the story is further illuminated by viewing them, and the ""betting"" sequence is quite amusing.Before you read any more of this review, or any others, I strongly suggest you buy and view the film.  If you still have doubts, check your local library -- many of them stock the VHS or DVD version, and will lend it to you more cheaply than a typical neighborhood video rental place.  You may find that the local library doesn't stock it, but can get it from another nearby.  Some libraries have online account management which allow you to request a check out of a book or video from a more convenient location.  Everyone loves the selection at the video rental chain, but everyone should also try to support their local library.  You are after all paying for it.This movie recently won the Academy Award for Best Picture (2000) which has tinkled off a number of people (including about one third to one half of the subsequent reviewers here on Amazon).  Since there are 735+ reviews.... it seems like a good time for everyone to find a new hobby than reviewing ""Gladiator"".  Since we no longer have live bloodsports (at least, not in the US) we engage in endless debate on trivial subjects, such as whether this or that Oscar was deserved.  Two words -- WHO CARES?""Gladiator"" is visually stunning -- less so that it was on the big screen -- has an excellent and integrated sound track, believable characters, great performances throughout, and the companion disk has a one hour documentary on the life of real Roman gladiators and the history of the ""games"".  Other features of the companion disk include scenes that had to be cut, a making of the film diary of the child actor who played Lucius, as well as a behind the scenes documentary I didn't have the heart to watch.The movie is a work of art, and therefore, despite the fact that historical background was used, the plot is fictional.  On the other hand, the emperor Commodus was suspected of murdering his father; he had some sort of physical ailment that lasted throughout his adult life; and the real Commodus was murdered by a slave who was employed by the emperor's political enemies to do so.That said, the historical accuracy of various details -- battle tactics and equipment, the names of the emperors and their families, the simulated city skylines -- is magnificent.Tigers were used in the real Roman games, as were orangutans (which were rediscovered in their SE Asian habitat in recent centuries), Indian elephants, and other Asian species imported for that purpose.  The monsoon trade route to and from the Far East has been known for thousands of years, and in Hellenistic times became well known -- probably not for the first time -- in the Mediterranean basin.  There are still those who think that no one sailed beyond the sight of the shore prior to 1400 AD, but those people are a pack of landlubber ninnies.""Spartacus"" was a better film only in that the title character was loosely based on a real historical figure.  But that movie was also a work of fiction, no less so than ""Gladiator"".  ""Ben Hur"" I've not seen, but know that it was similarly fictionalized.  I do hope that any historical blockbuster films which follow in the footsteps of ""Gladiator"" do as good a job of virtual time travel.Recommended viewing:-:- I, Claudius (DVD set, B00004U12X)-:- Spartacus (DVD, B00005A8TY)Recommended reading:-:- Everyday Life In Ancient Rome by Lionel Casson (0801859921)-:- Travel in the Ancient World by Lionel Casson (0801848083)-:- The Ancient Mariners by Lionel Casson (0691014779)-:- Sick Caesars by Michael Grant, particularly for the profiles of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus (0760709378, 00090312011)-:- A Scandalous History of the Roman Emperors by Anthony Blond (0786707593)"	4.0	Thumbs down is a good thing in the ancient Roman arena	2001-01-08	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A34WLHY06FVBKP	"Howard Sauertieg ""Howard Sauertieg"""	Among the good qualities of the DVD are the following:  1) widescreen format, 2) very revealing &quot;director's commentary&quot; to play over the film's audio track, and 3) fine reproduction of the film's picture and soundtrack.The glories of &quot;Gladiator&quot; are superficial, but the principal players do turn in fine thespian performances.  No amount of good acting can conceal the limp plot structure and the basic  sensationalism of the director's &quot;artistic&quot; vision.  The premise of the film -- that a popular gladiator could become a contender for the throne of the Roman Empire -- is ludicrous and reveals a profound ignorance of reality.  The director's commentary explains how Ridley Scott and his crew avoided dealing with authentic history in order to make this picture.  To &quot;experts&quot; who point out that this or that never occurred, or could not have occurred owing to the nature of things in that era, the filmmaker's response is &quot;how do you know?  were you there?&quot;  So they used &quot;logic&quot; to recreate Rome &quot;as it must necessarily have been.&quot;  The logic here is that of the director, the script writer, the set designer... in two words, HOLLYWOOD LOGIC.Where actual fact would interfere with the plot, the filmmakers chose to simply ignore the fact, as with the facts that Commodus ruled for over a decade, was not accused of murdering his father, had no erotic designs on his sister, fought in the arena over 700 times against men and wild beasts and styled himself &quot;The Roman Hercules.&quot;  All the film takes from this interesting history (much more interesting than the formula melodrama that is &quot;Gladiator&quot;) is the fact that Commodus liked attending the gladiatorial games, and the rest is simply swept under the rug.I enjoyed &quot;Gladiator&quot; in the theater and despite what annoys me about the movie I actually enjoy every minute of it.  The story moves along rapidly, like a river breaking through a dam, and the sister of Commodus is unusually beautiful, i.e. not a cookie-cutter Hollywood bombshell.  The fight scenes are suitably convincing, though edited so aggressively that it's hard to follow who's hitting who and where the fighters stand in relation to one another in the arena.  The CGI work stands as a marvel of modern filmmaking.The musical score is appropriate and really helps to energize the story.Finally, the 2:30 running time is hardly noticeable; Scott &amp; company must be doing something right to keep the film from seeming overly long.If you want to learn something about Roman history, read some books (Edward Gibbon's &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; tells the story of Commodus -- it doesn't resemble &quot;Gladiator&quot; at all).  If you want a gory, expensive-looking action film in which the good guys win, &quot;Gladiator&quot; isn't a bad way to kill an evening.	3.0	History? Humbug!	2001-03-23	2	0	2

(In my opinion Rob Roy is another, better version of this story.) The action sequences are top-notch and Russell Crowe portrays the quiet strength of a weary veteran quite well.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2GIZHVOIYKYWL	"hultrain ""hultrain"""	This was a movie that didn't quite live up to its potential.  I think director Ridley Scott couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted to shoot a guilty-pleasure toga flick with lots of pointless-but entertaining- fight scenes or an intellectual, historical epic on a grand scale.  What he ended up with were pointless-and only mildly entertaining-fight scenes stuck amongst plot re-treads lifted straight out of Braveheart (with none of the actual &quot;heart&quot;)  As I've said, the story is one we've heard before...  Ruthless yet loyal soldier is double-crossed by the very politicians he has risked his own neck for.  Various members of the hero's family are offed by said dirty politicians (in one of the movie's few powerful and well-done scenes).  Hero then undertakes an against-all-odds campaign to overthrow/destroy said dirty politicians with the help of the common rabble.  Yawn.The one plus in this movie is the sublimely understated performance of Russel Crowe, who is able to deliver his corny pseudo-Shakespearian lines (why is it that every movie set in a time period before the 1800s contains Shakespearian dialect, no matter if the movie is set in Elizabethan England or in ancient Rome?) with a modicum of grace, imbuing the corny script with just a bit of decency.  On the other hand is Joaquin Phoenix, a usually fine actor, flubbing the role of the bad guy by playing him as an affected, simpering wuss-boy with an unhealthy (and entirely pointless) affection for his own sister.  His performance makes the final mano-a-mano hero v. bad guy scene at the end seem unbelievable and anti-climactic.  Had his character been outright ruthless and plain Darth Vader-style evil, this movie may have ended on a better note.  As usual, Ridley Scott's directing and accompanying cinematography is spotty.  The haunting battle scenes at the opening of the movie, and the gripping scene involving the death of Maximus'wife and son are (unfortunately) marred by the slow pacing and uninventiveness of the final duel.  The fight scenes, which showed so much promise in the previews and t.v. spots for the movie, are on the whole just good when viewed in that perspective-as advertisements, rather than good movie-making.  Filled with jump-cuts and inexplicable tracking shots counterweighted with jerky, almost hand-held-camera-looking shots ended up being more style than substance; half the time, you couldn't follow what was going on.  Also, some of the CG effects, especially the wide-angle views of Rome and the colliseum, were almost laughingly bad.  It's funny that these shots probably would have wowed me a few years ago; it's just that moves like Titanic, the Matrix, and Star Wars, Ep. 1 just raised the bar for large-scale computer effects so high, that Gladiator has to struggle just to perform a simple chin-up. Ironically, the small-scale special effects (in particular a battle scene involving free-range tigers)were pretty good, and the atmosphere of the movie probably would have been a whole lot more believable if they'd thrown out the hokey, look-ma-no-hands wide-angle shots, which really only take up about 10 seconds of the movie.  The movie is worth renting, and if you're a Ridley Scott or Russel Crowe afficionado, then its definitely worth clicking the &quot;buy&quot; button; if you don't fall into those categories, then maybe you should go with &quot;Braveheart&quot; instead.	3.0	A lukewarm sandal 'n' sword pic	2000-10-30	24	9	15
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1GXDBQ1MW1O3O	"Hung Cheuk Man ""Lawrence"""	Looking at the sheer no. of reviews generated by this movies indicated that the movie is popular, at least in the commercial sense.  I always suspect everyone talks about this movie just because there has been no such kind of movie released for a long time. But it actually reminds me of &quot;Spartucus&quot; played by Kirk Douglas 40 (wow!) years ago.Same as Spartucus, Maximus represents the figure (or was he a hero?) struggling against the established regime.  The story portrays Maximus (played by Russel Crowe) as a tragic person rather than a hero.  As a noble general (he has a closed relationship to Ceasar and an affection of Caesar's daughter Lucilla), Maximus lacks the same charisma as Spartucus, though he may be fiercer.  He can fight and win battle after battle.  But fate determines that he is the enemy to the heir of the dying Caesar, Emperor Commondus (played by Jaoquin Phoenix).The movie does convey the good and evil between the two persons vividly, not unlike Ridley Scott's prior movies (Aliens). But then again, this is somewhat simplistic in Scott's world: there is only two sides, good and evil, and the good will always win the eternal battle against the bad in the end.  Not many would agree this in summation.In the 60's, a movie like this would be called &quot;epic&quot;, &quot;grand&quot;.  Nowadays, everybody knows everything &quot;grand&quot; in the movie is digital: the Germania battle, the Arena, the people..... You won't really get the feeling that you were there.  You are just watching a movie, if not a cartoon.Gladiator is not a bad movie, but certainly not one of the best. You know this movie lacks something.  It is sometimes superficial, sometimes intrigued.  You have a mixed feeling and you are not sure whether you like it or not. To the Lisa Gerrard's fan, the soundtrack may be a consolation.  To the Scott's fan, they may look the &quot;Aliens&quot; again because Emperor Commondus is no Alien.	3.0	Better visual effect not means better story-telling	2000-12-18	6	2	4

So Mr. Scott lost Mad Max, But stole so many plot and scene ideas from Gibsons 'Braveheart', that if Gibson had appeared, this Hollywood pap festival might have been considered a sequel.  How Crowe snared the best actor award for his gutteral, mono-syllabic General/Slave/Gladiator is beyond me. The myriad computer effects are so poorly done, that almost all the generated landscapes look like a childs water color. The fast/slow motion moments, the the realing camera work, all make for virtual indigestion. Crowe, after being enslaved, becomes even more reticent, and is the least impressive physically of all the would be Gladiators. Joaquin Phoenix plays the new Cesar on the Pax Romana block, and plays it very poorly. Scott seemed to want him to come off as a wicked, evil, back stabbing, incestious dog. Instead Phoenix is more a sniveling, cringing annoyance than a mad tyrant. The plot ,which is hackenyed and thin, is also incongrously slow. I think Rome was Built and conquered in less time then it takes for this dud to complete.  Save your money, time and patience, because this movie isnt worth any of those.	2.0	Over-hyped, Under developed, thinly veiled BraveHeart copy.	2001-05-29	9	5	4
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A156Y4GUBCHGCY	Hyunsoo Moon	Personally, I have anticipated a LOT from this film, because of the director Ridley Scott as well as my favorite film composer Hans Zimmer who is a genius, as well as the cast, including a fine cast: Russel Crowe and Richard Harris and Joquin Phoenis and others. But I was very, very disappointed with this film.First of all, this was a very beautiful film. This was a very well-photographed film, but not the right way. There are certain ways you shoot a film depending on its genre. Epics such as this film should be shot in a grand way such as THE LAST EMPEROR(which was probably the BEST photographed film[Vittorio Storaro])and it can't be shot in a way that films such as THELMA AND LOUISE was, for example, which was a Ridley Scott film. The murky look of the Roman Empire as well as the shot of the Roman city and the Colussium was shot in a way that closed off the grand view from the viwers. Were some shots grand? Yes, but the shots weren't edited right. Many shots in this film were shot in a way that closed off from the audience of what the Roman Empire, the full scale of Roman Empire might have looked like.Also, the script. The script actually didn't have THAT many problems. But a little more character development for Djimon Hounsou might have been nice, as well as a little more look at what Joaquin Phoenix did after being the friggin Emperor of ROME might have been nice as well!The music: HANS ZIMMER and LISA GERRARD RULE!!!! I loved the soundtrack. I bought it because I HAD to listen to this finely composed music as well as Lisa Gerrard's beautiful vocals.(especially the ending)The cast was very very fine. Exceptional work by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and others have pulled off arguably the best ensemble casted in a film this year.So why do I say &quot;So Close, but so far away...&quot;? Well, all the ingridients for a very very VERY fine epic film are here: Ridley Scott, one of the most influential film director, Hans Zimmer, God of film music, cinematographer who can pull off beautiful images, and a very fine cast, but WHAT WENT WRONG???!!!! Well, I guess it was just bad choices by some of the people during the production, but I must say, this COULD have been an AWESOME film...	2.0	So Close, but so far away...	2000-10-02	5	1	4
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2ICW5OUWX2A2V	Ian	When I watched the academy awards I had this nagging feeiling that Gladiator, a really big bang film would withought a doubt win best picture.  I was right.  While Gladiator looks really cool and exciting on the surface, if you look deeper you will see that this is a average movie that dosent really excell in any general area.  Now I want to point out that this is not a bad movie, it just dosent excell in any area, the story line is okay, the action is okay, the charachters are okay, everything is pretty much okay.  The music is the big part of this movie, although at first glance it just sounds like a women humming and singing although it really helps set the mood.  The action sequences for this movie are okay but are really violent and should not be watched by anyone under 15.  In conclusion this is just another okay movie that is worth a rental and a purchase of the soundtrack and that is about it.The Good: Great soundtrack, action sequences are good, the ending  is pretty goodThe bad: the characters arnt really developed, nothing really astonishingAnd the ugly: the action sequences are gory and only for mature audiences.	3.0	Great music and action but not much else	2001-06-22	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AYO0R7CZWGMCU	Ian Schulz	Before I saw Gladiator, I had been very interested in historical epics like Braveheart or Ben-Hur. When I sat down and watched this movie with my dad and brother (please don't crucify me for watching it on VHS)I was afraid the script wouldn't be all that great and it may be too bloody. But this film left me awestruck by its power. Its grand sense of dignity, honor and passion, from the great Ridley Scott made for great entertainment. The script by David Franzoni, William Nicholson and John Logan was excellent, using old poetic dialogue to readily convey the proper feelings (By the way, John Logan is writing the script for the next Star Trek movie, so I'm sure it will be great). Other pluses were the beautiful sets and costumes, the great cinematography and special effects, a grand, moving musical score and the fabulous performances of Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Djimon Honsou, Spencer Treat Clark and especially Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe, whose brilliant performances highlited this film.I was very glad to see the movie win Oscars for Best Picture, Actor (Crowe), Costumes, Sound and Visual Effects, though I would have liked to see it win more. For anyone who likes action, drama, good dialogue, visual splendor and good characterizations, I highly reccomend this film.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2GYIDJ1COED2K	Ihazo	If films were judged by looks alone, then this one would truly be a classic. The film is Ridley Scott's attempt at a post millennial sword and sandals epic akin to SPARTUCUS or BEN HUR though the final product bears a closer resemblance to CONAN THE BARBARIAN plus some added pretension. With GLADIATOR it's obvious that Scott really wanted to make an important film rather than an exploitive action yarn like CONAN, though his expository scenes are dull and lacking in the charge of his spastic action sequences. Still, even those sequences really don't work on quite the level they're supposed to.Thus begins our B-movie epic: Maximus (Russell Crowe in what would have been the Jean-Claude Van Damme role had this film been made a mere 10 years ago) is picked (for very hackneyed political reasons) by the emperor of Rome (Richard Harris, seething with Shakespearean glee) to be his replacement, but the emperor's son Commudus (Joaquin Phoenix) will have none of that. He's a greedy, whiny brat who wants to rule so badly that he kills his own father, takes his throne, then orders his guards to lead Maximus out into the woods and have him killed. The plan goes awry for Commodus when the mighty Maximus (I smell a HERCULES spin-off waiting in the wings) escapes in a rousing and appropriately brutal getaway. He races on foot back to his picturesque commode hoping to be greeted by his family, only when he arrives they've already been killed by Commudus' minions. Our hero passes out and is eventually picked up by slave traders--the kind of slave traders who roam the countryside searching for unconscious victims of those corrupt Romans. You know the kind. He's sold to Proximo (Oliver Reed, sharper than ever in his final performance), a former gladiator and current trainer. After Maximus endures some qualifying bouts under the reluctant guidance of Proximo, he makes his way up to the much-dreaded Coliseum.My biggest caveat with the flick is how hollow its script is. No emotion feels true; it's as if the screenwriters poured over BRAVEHEART in an attempt to transport that story to the time of the Coliseum. And with no help from Ridley Scott who seems to think that he can compensate for that lack of depth by giving us lengthy expository scenes and making his characters overly gloomy. Those expository scenes are akin to the political trial scenes in STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE, which virtually everyone will agree were dramatically inert, passionless, and, well, boring. GLADITOR's expository scenes are just as tedious, and while the dialogue is mostly decent and the performances are above par, there's nothing behind it all, no subtext, no character.The battle scenes are easily some of the worst edited in some time. The very first fight (meant to establish Crowe as a fighting man's general of war) begins with nightsky-scraping flaming arrows that dash across in the twilight emitting a magically-lethal orange glow. As the conflict rages, the camera angles become increasingly narrowed and the screen full of flames and blurred soldiers in slow mo. But the effect becomes over-digitized in a strobe reminiscent of a consumer camera, subtracting from the realism and gravity of the fight. And instead of continuing the ever-tightening angle to personalize the savagery, a few mid-wide shots are tossed in. It breaks up the direction of the sequence and ruins the hypnotic effect.Nevertheless, people are eating this film up. There is a ton of extra features on the DVD and no doubt it will go down as a classic for generations to enjoy -- *sigh*	2.0	B-movie Epic	2000-12-06	13	4	9

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A5TUY9IFBKNOK	"Isabelle ""isabellec"""	"I hadn't seen this movie when it came out in theaters (yes, I know, that was me, the one single person who actually didn't go see it).  Finally got around to renting the double-disc dvd and am blown away by it.  Much has already been said in praise (rightly so), of Ridley's direction, (superb, no one does it better), the effects (unbelievably good looking, in all respects; they may have not built Rome in a day, but came pretty damn close); the lighting, the score, the action/battle/coliseum scenes, the costuming, all of it magnificent and appropriately sweeping and grandiose.  For me, however, its' the acting that makes the movie.  Russell Crowe as Maximus is terrific, (particularly in the more sensitive aspects of his character, as when he dreams of home and family); and everyone else, including Richard Harris in his final role, fantastic; even the child actor, Spencer Clark, as heir to the throne Lucius, does a nice job in tunic and English accent.  For me, though, the scene stealer was Joaquin Phoenix as the arrogant, jealous, incestuous, chilling, pathetic, wholly mad Emperor Commodus.  We can see his health and grip on sanity decline as the movie progresses; his pallor becomes more and more pasty, his eyes become more and more sunken with dark circles beneath as his hold on Rome slips, and his paranoia and irrationality grow.  The infamous ""Busy bees/AM I NOT MERCIFUL????!!!!"" scene really sends shivers!I also wanted to comment on the extras included in the double disc set on the dvds.  There are some great features on this.  My favorites are the behind-the-scenes specials, detailing the special effects, the fight choreography, the architecture, the history of the gladiator games, etc.  There are interviews with many of the creative folks involved, including with most of the actors, and they are all delighted to be doing what they doing, most of them playing around and joking in the interviews.  (Russell Crowe laughs about being so close to live tigers in some of the arena scenes, and then being told he shouldn't play a ""girlie-game"" like soccer because of the risk involved; Joaquin Phoenix told of riding into the coliseum via chariot, as Ceaser Commodos, waving to the crowd in a ""regal"" manner, all the while thinking ""Who am I kidding, I'm from Florida"".) It's little insights like that which makes it that much more interesting, at least for me.My favorite part of the bonus material is a written movie journal by the young actor Spencer Clark; the child really is very bright and articulate and I was impressed with his descriptions of the filming process and life as a child actor.  He's really quite observant and insightful and made friends with everyone on the set. His reactions to what was going on around him, the enormity of it all, with the same kind of excitement and fascination that us laymen probably would.  I liked his behind the scene pictures too, including of Crowe and family and ""mates"" at a cricket match/barbecue, and teaching Spencer some naughty limericks. (Spencer got him back later with some of his own.)  He teased Phoenix about his costume being a ""dress"", and also commented on a scene he filmed with Phoenix and himself where a sword Phoenix as Commodus was leaning on slipped, and Phoenix was professional enough to continue with the scene with a straight face and saved the take. He was so into the character, so intense, that that little mistake made it into the movie and it seemed ""right"", somehow. These kinds of things can't be scripted, they happen by accident and can either be a ruined take or add a tiny nuance to the character. Spencer Clark was very impressed with Joaquin, and so was I (even more so!) upon learning this little tidbit.The dvd earns the five stars I've given it.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	"This extended version is a lot denser that what I remembered of the 2000 commercial version. The politics of Rome are explored in a lot more detail, particularly that strange power the Roman Emperor had because of his own praetorian guard that was doing absolutely everything he ordered, and took orders only from the Emperor. At the end, when the Emperor is dead or nearly dead because he is defeated and disarmed, they refuse to obey their own officer. They will obey him only when the sister comes down and legitimizes Maximus. You only meet servile people and even the Senate and the Senators are just as servile out of fear for their welfare. That could be extended to today, even if today in our democratic countries this manipulation of people is less obvious, less direct, less based on the fear of the leaders but on the fear of an external danger propped up and exploited by the leaders. Fear is still the main nerve of the crowd, and then provide them with some bread and good circus entertainment and they will follow your fears to the end of the world. The film is also extremely clear about two barbaric practices of this supposedly civilized Roman Empire. The conquest war that is not, far from it, always justified by any offensive aggressivity from the ""barbarians"" from beyond the frontiers of the empire. It is brutal and unequal. The advanced technology of the time is on the Roman side. Easy to win when you add to this advanced technology the military professionalism of the Roman Legion. And even so it is shown as what it is: an unclean inhumane and inhuman practice. Worse even the film shows the slave trade and the total reduction of these slaves not even to animals but to objects, properties, commodities you deal with and dispose of the way you want. What the film does not say is that the vast majority of this Roman society is composed of slaves, house slaves, garden slaves, hard work slaves, sex slaves and of course the famous gladiators, the fighting slaves. They all end in death, these slaves, a vast majority premature death imposed onto them by their masters or circumstances, but always to satisfy the desire of a free Roman citizen. The particularity of gladiators is that their end is to die in public from the hand of another gladiator or just mangled by a wild beast or some technical trap. At the top of the ladder of that death is the death decided by the Emperor himself. The film is of course extremely precise about these circus entertainments though concentrating only on the gladiators. There were many other ways to entertain the populace in the Coliseum, true entertainment always bringing death to some people down there in the arena for the real pleasure of the public. This has not changed at all, I mean the pleasure of being the witness of some gross, violent, repulsive dying process imposed onto the dying person by one or many other human beings. The only change is that it does not happen in circuses any more, and with real live, if I can say so, performances of the death of each victim. We have invented in the meantime a machine that enables us to give the illusion of seeing that and yet that does not happen for real. That is called the cinema. In the old days, the Greeks had dramatic productions for that cathartic function, but the Romans did not want anything illusionary, they wanted the real thing and they got it for several centuries with these gladiators and later the Christians, and all the time the executing in public places of all discontents, and even, when you could afford a slave, the real torturing and killing in all possible variations of your slave. We seem to forget, and this film reminds us of it, that the Roman Empire, and before it the Greek or Hellenistic empire was just based on the inflicting of death to any kind of people as the very justification of the social order, the political order or plainly your own prestige or authority. And some speak of this empire as a great period of civilization. Due to these slaves some inventions like watermills devised in the first century BCE were only exploited in the 10th century CE by the Benedictines, hence in the middle of what some call the dark ages (sorry no capital letters). A great film in this extended version.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"	5.0	Luckily slavery does not exist anymore	2001-09-07	2	2	0

The movie has many good parts in it, like in the beginning when there's a big battle.  All the battle and action scenes in the movie are good too, but the opening one is my favorite.  This is all I really liked, though, the action.  The other stuff -- the acting, dialog, and ending -- wasn't any good.  For those who've read 'Hamlet' you'll know the ending was unoriginal.  I vaguely remember reading 'Hamlet' in high school, but I know it ended with poison, like 'Gladiator' does.  So the ending's no good.  The acting and dialog is pretentious.  So many looks and words are exaggerated or embellished for effect.  R. Crow's performance is good, and he's a good actor, but I think he's almost too good, to the point where he's unbelievable.  For me, and I'm sure for everyone, I need to believe a movie to really appreciate it.	3.0	It wasn't that great	2002-01-14	2	1	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3RIIMSG5HB0J8	"""jake_l"""	Gladiator took home the Oscar for the Best Motion Picture of 2001 and rightfully so. Gladiator is a great movie with a great plot. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is taken from a high place of being a general with the Roman Army to a lowly slave and gladiator. Without giving away any more of the plot, I will just say that Maximus engages in several fights for his life and for Rome.Every member of the cast in this film of epic porportions deliever the best performances of their career. No element of this film is done unintelligently, which actually would have been very easy to do in a film about a time where men wore women's style garments. The only thing that may be over rated is the special effects, some of which are clearly CGI (Computer Generated Imagery).The Special Features Disc includes features that go above and beyond the normal call of duty. It flaunts some things we have never seen on any DVD yet. Dairies, trailors, televison spots, and many featurettes.Bottom Line:You will love Gladiator. If you like action movies you get plenty of fights. If you like romance you will find that in Gladiator as well. Some war as well, inklings of comedy, and drama make it a blend of everything we go to the movies for. This is why Gladiator is the best picture of 2001 and possibly one of the top ten best American films ever. Anyone who wants a great film and a great DVD should purchase Gladiator right away without one thought of hesitation, rather you have seen it or not.	5.0	"Gladiator is a Film Full of ""Strength and Honor"""	2002-04-13	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AENYQWVUHTXKF	Jake Scott	This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever produced.  Every scene of this movie provided the glue that kept you tight in your seat.  Every aspect of the architectural lay out of Rome and the Coliseum were perfectly recreated.  There is absolutely no flaws as every detail is perfectly depicted.  This movie's script is the perfect story and as far as the acting goes, Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were brilliant.  Crowe, well deserved his Oscar and Phoenix should have won &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; in my opinion.  By the closing scene of the movie I absolutely despised Phoenix, so his task as the evil emperor of Rome was succesfully completed.  The DVD itself is full of special features as a second disc is included with the feature disc to better contain all of the extra footage.  It is very interesting to take a glimpse at how Rome was recreated and how other things developed as well.  In all you get an extremely great deal as Gladiator includes the amazing feature presentation followed up by special features on a second disc.  This is a must for your DVD library, so I recommend that you purchase it in the nearest future.	5.0	RIGHTFULLY DESERVES ITS BEST PICTURE HONORS!	2001-04-21	2	0	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3UQ44J23PZ39T	James A. Altman	Back in the year 2000, as we oohed and aahed at the spectacle of Ridley Scott's epic and were blown away by an ensemble of powerful performances from Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, and more, we never guessed that this film would so accurately prophesy the next six years.Indeed, a modern-day Commodus would steal the throne of an empire, neuter its Senate (and House of Representatives) and pander to an unwitting populace with an unending series of gladiatorial games (the war on terror).  George W. Commodus has all but assassinated his wiser, kinder, gentler father and eagerly disassembled many of his nobler works during a smirking, self-indulgent six-year reign. He has even survived the challenge of a popular former general (Wesley Clark) whom he did not have to stab in the back before their contest (the loyal opposition did it for him). The still-unanswered question is who will rise up as our Maximus to strike down the petulant boy-emperor and restore the dream that once was the United States of America?	5.0	An Unintended Prophecy	2006-06-25	34	6	28

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1GBMGSDDG7BFL	James Crouch	Gladiator is everything that a modern epic film should be. This film is a towering triumph that will not soon be forgotten. It features a very well-written script, amazing visuals, incredible moments of both action and drama, as well as absolutely stellar acting performances from the entire cast. Russell Crowe established himself as one of the best actors in the world today, with his commanding and emotionally powerful portrayal of Maximus, who is a hero in every sense of the term. Crowe deserves every accolade that he gets for his marvelous performance, which was by far one of the most commanding and heartfelt performances I have ever seen in a movie. Crowe's work in The Insider and L.A. Confidential made him a legitimate star, while his role in Gladiator cemented his position as one of the most prominent leading actors in Hollywood today. Crowe, an avid horseback rider, even did many of his own stunts in the movie. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a breakthrough performance as Commodus, the emotionally conflicted son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, played by veteran actor Richard Harris. Phoenix's performance demands sympathy as well as hatred from the viewer, with gripping emotions as well as an ever-present sense of jealousy and spite. The late, great Oliver Reed(who died shortly before filming wrapped), put the finishing touch on a storied career with his performance as Proximo, the slave ower who helps Maximus regain his freedom. Connie Nielsen, a relative newcomer, also delivers an excellent performance as Commodus' older and wiser sister, who has had previous involvement with Maximus. The visuals in this movie are absolutely stunning, as ancient Rome is brought to life like never before with some absolutely amazing computer-generated visuals, as well as painstakingly crafted sets. Scenes of battle in this movie are graphic but never overindulgent, and convey a sense of the brutality that must have existed during this time. This movie is grand in both story and scale, and visuals serve to reinforce the strong acting by providing an unbelievable backdrop for the story. Ridley Scott, who is a master of skillful character filming, does not disappoint in what many people consider his finest film to date, as his skillful camera work gives a deep insight into the emotions of every character in the film. Gladiator is truly an epic achievement. Dreamworks did an excellent job with the Gladiator DVD, with some of the cleanest audio and video transfers I have seen on the DVD format. This movie was meant to be watched on DVD as the enhanced picture and sound really serve to heighten the experience of watching this movie. The DVD also contains nearly 4 (yes, four) hours of bonus materials including 30 minutes of deleted scenes, an HBO first look special, several commentaries, as well as a 50 minute documentary from the Learning Channel called: Bloodsport of a Gladiator, which examines the lives of actual Gladiators in ancient Rome. The inclusion of a journal by young actor Spencer Treat Williams, (who plays Lucius, the eventual heir to the throne of Rome)is n especially welcome addition. The DVD actually devotes a second disc solely to the special features.  The Bottom Line is this: Gladiator is a true modern epic, one of the best films ever made. It features incredible acting, a gripping storyline, and absolutlely stunning visuals. This movie is a must-have for any DVD collection. Movies just don't get much better than this.	5.0	Monumental!

Props to the casting director who, it seemed, made some interesting choices that paid off big. I am happy that a blockbuster action hero type was not cast as the gladiator and they went with Russel Crowe. Crowe really does have some acting chops. Who would thought that a shy, introverted, tabacco executive (The Insider) could knock it out of the park as a Roman General. ""Quintus why are you armed?"" was a memorable scene along with others.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2BXQ4NTLK46A4	James Irwin	Five stars,  five stars,  five stars... yeah, yeah, sure.  GLADIATOR is as over-rated a movie as was released this year. While it's no BLAIR WITCH PROJECT in that respect, it still gets an insane amount of praise for so ordinary an effort.Yes, Russell Crowe is magnetic (and I guess if you're inclined in that direction, sexy and hunky) and Ridley Scott can still pull off his usual hat tricks (he remains the best director making bad films in the business) but really, this is a hollow effort.But, yes, the gladiatorial scenes are a sight to behold.  No doubt about it, Scott is a visual master and the combat scenes are intense and rousing.  If only the rest of the film were as vital and entertaining.  It's not just that we've seen it all before a million times, it's that it is so so ordinary about the whole thing.  The critics grousing about PHANTOM MENACE should have been doing double duty here and I bet they weren't.So, for sure, if you haven't seen GLADIATOR yet, rent it, but buy it only if you, for some silly reason, really love it.If you are looking for some great action scenes and rousing conflict on the field of battle, this is a place to look.  But, if you also want to see a great film to go along with it, I think you need to look elswhere.Thanks for your time people.	2.0	TWO AND A HALF STARS	2000-10-18	23	6	17

Confidential (Two-Disc Special Edition)(1997) where I first saw Crowe.  I had to see him in more movies.  Then I saw him inA Beautiful Mind (Full Screen Awards Edition)(2001). He should have won the Academy Award for his performance, but he did not.  He was only nominated, but that is still an honor too.  Since then, I have seen Crowe inProof(1991),Hammers over the Anvil(1991),The Sum of Us(1994) andThe Insider(1999).  I had to give Gladiator (2000) one more try.  Their was the scenes where the tiger almost got Russell Crowe in real-life.  They left that scene in there.  The scenes with the tiger was an eye-opener.  Crowe being shackled was memorable.Actor Oliver Reed,Tommy(1975), died during production of this film. He was arm wrestling in a bar, heavily intoxicated. he had a sudden heart attack on May 2, 1999.

It was the first time I've seen a movie set in ancient times where the costumes didn't look like they were taken from a toga scene in a bad college movie.  The script, acting, and music work so well together, it sends the viewer along for an emotional roller coaster.  It is one of those movies where you guys might have to tell your wives/girlfriends that you have an eyelash to get out of your eye.  The battle scenes are amazing, a bit on the gory side, but is expected considering the subject matter.  The casting director should be given a promotion for his/her work here.  The special effects, concerning the recreation of ancient Rome in all of it's glory, are striking.  I found the extras worth watching.  It is the first time I actually sat down and watched a movie over again with just the commentary playing.  Russell Crowe points out a few bloopers that are still in the movie, which I found interesting.  If you watch the extras, you will be surprised by how hard it was to film the Proximo character, since Oliver Reed had passed away before filming was finished.  5 out of 5 and thumbs up to be sure!	5.0	Gladiator (collector's edition)	2007-03-13	6	5	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A253WFE8XBPIG9	James Robert Smith	This movie was overrated. While it's an okay adventure film, the story's plot holes are large and glaring and rather frustrating. The acting was workmanlike, but really undeserving of any extra praise, and Crowe certainly did not give an Oscar-caliber performance.Additionally, the film was disappointingly historically inaccurate. Commodus reigned as emperor for about thirteen years, was a physically imposing individual of daunting martial prowess, and his death was the result of intrigue and poison rather than as portrayed in the film.I wish I'd rented this, rather than having bought a copy for my extensive dvd collection.

It combined a classic story (part vengance, part action) and incredible sets into an truely epic experience.  In addition the acting is superb and the special effects seamless.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AIPV5GBGTV2ZO	Jason Brown	When I saw Gladiator for the first time, I was instantly drawn into the story.  The very first scene, where we see Maximus dreaming of his home, then gazing at a bird fluttering away, shows us a lot of his dual personality.  He instantly turns deadly serious and faces battle with courage, and even a touch of humor as a smile crosses his face when he almost takes out one of his own men.  The battle scenes are gritty, but still manage to convey a sense of heroism.  Hans Zimmer's score is wonderfully appropriate (how did it not win Best Score?), and the inclusion of Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus was a stoke of genius by the casting crew.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A6X8HOBK5V9ZV	Jason Brown	Gladiator is an amazing film on many levels:  it is a broad, expansive, epic movie that has not been attempted in many years in Hollywood...that has an amazing center in the character of Maximus (Russell Crowe), who falls victim to the ambition of the illegitimate Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).  On the other hand, it can be very personal and intimate at times...witness the very first scene, where we see Maximus daydream of being home, running his hand through his farmland.  Or the various scenes where we see him wrestle with his desire to avenge the death of his wife and son while attempting to rid Rome of the vile Commodus.  This is a film that is absolutely riveting from beginning to end; it is impossible to overstate the impact that Hans Zimmer's score has on the action...and the heart-wrenching emotion from Lisa Gerrard's voice harkens back to Titanic.  If you haven't seen this...I suggest you do as soon as possible!	5.0	Shadows and Dust!	2002-09-17	4	2	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1SL605WH48U32	Jason Debly	Until I saw this film, I was beginning to seriously doubt the ability of Hollywood to produce engaging, powerful, epic films.  My faith is renewed.In part, the film is a tremendous success because it conveys the notion of what it means to be a good person. Russell Crowe as general Maximus shows the viewer that a man (or woman) must act from integrity, and not from self interest.  In the film, Maximus has the opportunity to return to his beloved family, so long as he will endorse the depraved emperor Commodus.  Maximus does not act from self-interest, but rather from integrity by rejecting the murdeous emperor.  As a result, he loses everything, but not his dignity.The film notes how words like 'honour' and 'trust' had lost meaning in the Roman Empire, and similarly poses the question of whether those words have today lost meaning for the viewer.This film is a must see!  It is a classic already.	5.0	An Incredible Epic!	2001-01-03	4	4	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2Y7U0SQTG8NFR	Jason G. Baskin	Gladiator is one of the best big movies of all-time.  Not only was the acting phenomenal, but the storyline, usually missing from blockbuster films, was superb.  First, the film opens with a fascinating battle scene that gets your heart pumping and eyes open.  Next, the action slows down but the plot grips.  Finally, the film takes the viewer on a roller coaster of plot twists and turns with great action to go along.  At the expense of spoiling the movie for anyone my overall review of this film is that it is one of the best buys on DVD available on the market today.  Not only is the movie great but the oodles of special features will keep you entertained for months.  All in all, one of the best DVD's of all time.	5.0	A DVD for the ages!!	2000-11-24	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A8KDNHIYJ9339	Jason	Gladiator was one great epic, but I didnt think it deserved the Oscar. Why you ask? Because I thought Traffic was a much more important and much more interesting. I'm not into the movies set back in midevil times, so the appeal was little if any, until I saw it. The film really takes you by suprise, especialy the Oscar calibar performance of Russell Crowe. (Which still didnt measure up to Don Cheadle's or Michael Douglas' performances in Traffic).The film tells the story of how a King, (or was suppose to be a King), went from being a King to being a Slave, and then turning into a Gladiator!The story really strikes a cord as the special effects are really some of the best of recent memories. But it did last a little too long. Quite a few scenes were un-neccesary, and totaly uncalled for. But that aside the film really did good in the box-office.The DVD has tons of special features, and the 2 disc set makes a great addition to a DVD Collection.If you're really into the knights and kings and things of that nature, you're in for a treat.

Maximus (Russel Crowe) delivers a mind imprinting  performance as he goes from General of the Northern armies to becoming a  slave.  Forced into becoming a gladiator, he slowly climbs back to the top.  With many road bumps along the way, we see a man fight for love, honor, and  respect.

At the beginning of the movie where we see Maximus as a General leading a final battle, you see an amazing wide shot of flying, flaming, arrows.  It should look amazing, right?  Wrong.  The picture was DNR'd so badly that it actually removed arrows and the ones you can see are a blurred mess!  Absolutely terrible.  Don't waste your money on this.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ACPAVZMG54ADD	Jay S. Barrick	I believe that there are serious quality control problems with this new Gladiator Extended Edition based upon my own experience.I purchased my first copy on the day it was issued 8/23/05 at my local big box electronics store. I was very frustrated to find that there were multiple quality control problems with disc 3. The only feature that it would play was the production design primer. It would not play anything else on the disc. When I tried to go to each new section it would freeze up each time. I tried over a dozen times with no luck.I returned the set on 8/28/05 and exchanged the extended edition for another. They claimed they had no other complaints about disc 3 problems.Well when I tried to play the new exchanged extended edition disc 3 I was even more frustrated because now no features would play on disc 3. I will be returning this set for a full refund this week.I've seen other posts on other DVD sites where customers are also having problems with this Gladiator Extended Edition. I just read one where the customer could not get multiple features on disc 1 to play properly and he said he would be returning the set for a refund and stick to watching his two disc DTS version that came out several years ago.I plan to do the same. What a major disappointment. It is sad that there is so little quality control on a set that costs almost $30.00 most places.So buyer beware is my message. I'd be interested to know if other customers had problems with their Gladiator Extended Edition sets as well.JayHarrisburg,PA	1.0	Buyer Beware About This Extended Edition	2005-08-28	15	9	6
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A6GJ70R1C65QD	"JB ""Devoted Amazonian since 1996"""	Gladiator wants to be Ben-Hur, really.  There's no denying that the costumes, sets, visual effects, and gore are spectacular, but that's where the glory ends.  Russell Crowe is powerful and convincing in his role as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful as the sniveling coward Commodus, but the talents of these men are nearly overshadowed by the film's incredible length.Many of the scenes involve, of course, the gladiator contests, and it is in these that we see Maximus' power as both a survivor and superior fighter.  But in all honesty, about an hour into the movie, you feel as though you've been watching it much longer.  The film moves slowly and never seems to gain any real momentum.  You can fall asleep at many points in the movie, wake up, and be completely caught up in a few minutes, as I did.  The slaughter of Maximus' family doesn't quite pull at your heart like I think the director wanted it to.  I found myself more annoyed that Maximus wouldn't assume the power that Marcus was bequeathing him.That said, the extra DVD that accompanies the film is wonderful!  There are interviews, behind-the-scenes trivia, and a section of clips that ended up on the cutting room floor.  I really enjoyed watching the short segment on the costumes and special makeup required for the battle scenes.  The extra DVD has all sorts of goodies that are a DVD-owners dream!  If you're a big fan of the film and you own a DVD player, then this will be a great addition to your collection.The film is certainly worth seeing at least once for all of the special effects and Russell Crowe's amazing acting skills!	3.0	Good movie, but the extras on DVD outshine the film	2000-12-18	24	10	14
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2C5LA07JCDWTN	"J. Brittman ""The Bottom Line"""	I didn't want to like Gladiator in the worst way. I hate Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe but almost immediately after the first battle sequence, I knew that Gladiator was something special. The action sequences are top-notch and rival Braveheart. The best fighting sequence is the first in the Roman Coliseum where Crowe and his horde of slaves turn the tables on their opponents. The only other time I've ever been so pumped up after a movie was Die Hard. The adrenaline rush is great in Gladiator and eventhough I hate to admit it, Russell Crowe does an outstanding job as Maximus. The film is long (over 2 hrs) but it flies by (the sure sign of a great movie) and it leaves you wanting more. This is one of the only commercial films that I can truly say deserved the Oscar for best picture. This is a definate must own for your DVD library.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AISKF2I1CC5BY	"J. Capuano ""Joe Capuano (Avid Writer)"""	By the time I'm writing this review, this movie is already two years old.  However, I feel that the DVD creates such a strong presence for a film with excellent technical values that it can't go unrecognized.Odds are you've already seen this movie (or you already know what it's about), so I'll skip that part.  The story of how aa man loses power and then fights for revenge, while inadvertently gaining popularity, is a cliched story that reminds me of the E! True Hollywood Story on Hulk Hogan.  However, the film features powerful performances all around (especially from scene-stealing Phoenix) and a Rocky-esque script that will have you interested for the most part.  But the real cool thing about this movie is the action.  It's expertly directed (thanks to Ridley Scott) and is everything that action should be: action-packed.  The many action scenes contain graphic violence and copious blood-shedding, which adds to the film's off-the-charts entertainment factor.  (It's an action movie after all.  Have a sense of humor!)The film's Oscar-winning sound and visual effects are done justice in a big way.  The picture quality is excellent and provides a very film-like experience.  Colors are deep and well-saturated, but never bleed.  Blood spews across the screen and creates a very convincing experience.  Modest edge enhancement can't be ignored (at least not by me), but all in all, this is a near-reference quality disc with only one minor quibble from me.  Watch this film on the biggest, widest TV you can find.  The film's theatrical aspect ratio of 2:35.1 is preserved and is presented anamorphically.Now here's where it gets REALLY good: the sound.  Lord in Heaven, this has to be one of the greatest soundtracks ever burned onto a DVD.  Presented in DTS-ES and Dolby Digital EX, this is THE demo disc.  Surrounds used all the time (even in quiet scenes) and the ambient effects are exceptional.  During the battle scenes, swords clash, chariots turn over, flesh is pierced, and a bunch of white guys scream.  It's an audiophile's wet dream and shouldn't be missed.  The bottom end is extremely powerful and will give your subwoofer a good run.  Damn, this is a good mix.  The DTS is better due to more controlled bass, but both give you a big bang for your buck.  There is also a Dolby Surround 2.0 track.	4.0	A flawed, but entertaining movie, comes home on DVD.	2002-06-30	2	1	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A38XIX7IYNNFSV	JCARMODY1	Gladiator is a marvelous movie.  It gives you a sense of what it may have been like during these Roman times.  The story is, of course, fiction.  Maximus, quite possibly the greatest character created for the big screen, was made up and history was &quot;re-written&quot; for the sake of telling this story.  Ridley Scott has never denied that and has said that all along.  That aside, this movie is a must for people of all ages to watch and enjoy.  Movies like this are what get people excited for our world's history.  You'll be looking up these characters in books and online after watching the actors give such great performances as them.

This one delivers.First, the film is reasonably compelling and is certainly well-acted.  But I suspect most of us have seen the film.  Thus, what exactly is offered in addition to that?There is a grand making-of documentary that shows how the action and CGI are melded together, what influences went into the script and set design, how set and shots were conceived, and what the director was seeking to accomplish.There is also an incredibly interesting (perhaps since I'm a former music major) documentary on the composer, how he goes about creating films scores and the Gladiator score in particular, how the concepts of the film influence what he wants his music to communicate and how he managed to recruit a couple of hard-to-locate musicians for the pieces.There are tons of other extras as well: Deleted scenes with optional commentary, a hour long documentary (actually educational!) about the real Roman gladiators, production notes (a very interesting read--it all started with a painting!), etc.Not only is this a fun (not great; very good but not great) movie, you'll get the satisfaction of truly getting a sense for the whole creative process behind the film.	5.0	Fulfills the promise of what a DVD should be	2001-02-28	5	3	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"The plot of ""Gladiator"" has been adequately covered elsewhere -- a devoted and hugely successful Roman general slated to succeed the aging Emperor, is outfoxed by the Emperor's son, enslaved and returns to Rome as a gladiator to exact revenge. I found the movie to be thoroughly enjoyable, with incredible fight scenes including tigers, and an awesome recreation of ancient Rome. It's gotten to the point that you know there is CGI work going on, but you can't tell exactly what it is.The film is superbly casted, from Russell Crowe as the betrayed general to Joaquin Phoenix as cunning young Emperor Commodus, to Giannina Facio who plays Crowe's wife - seen only is a few off-screen moments. The armor and weaponry are terrific as well, being appropriately intimidating and sticking to period themes. The writing was rather workaday, but at least did not detract from the action. The big clich&eacute; of the plotline - hero wreaks havoc to avenge harm to his family - was surrounded by enough new and interesting material not to matter much.The star attraction, of course, was the Roman Coliseum and the games that were held within. As stated earlier, the computer images were utterly realistic, making the place seem perfectly real. The filmmakers also had the wit to allow a bit of emotional depth to the characters  -- for instance, allowing newcomers the time to marvel at the wonder of Roman architecture.The one false note had to do with Commodus's fate and the intent of his enemies.  Though the historical Commodus seems to have enjoyed dressing as a gladiator and had a too-close relationship with his sister, his fate is not as dramatic as portrayed in the film. Neither did Rome revert to a Republic, as implied in the film. These touches were inserted evidently to appeal to Western audiences, but do damage to history in a way that is intolerable - like writing a film in which George Washington builds the Panama Canal.The DVD extras in this edition are rather lame, and are little more than promotions for the film. An in-depth look at the making of Rome in a computer would have been fun and educations, but was not included.Shortcomings aside, the film is riveting and fun. Definitely recommended."	4.0	Sparkling symphony with a single false note	2006-07-02	14	6	8
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A24V613807XF17	Jeanine	I'm not normally a fan of Hollywood movies, but&quot;Gladiator&quot; is not the norm.  Although there were severalcircumstances in this film, which I sincerely doubt would ever havehappened in true roman times (ie.  the emperor (joaquin phoenix)fighting maximus (russell crowe) in the colliseum and the suddenchange of heart within the praetorian guard), this film truly deservesfive stars.  Crowe gives a splendid performance as the fearlesssoldier, merciful and uncorrupted and yet unfailingly worldly.Despite the violence, which Crowe's character displays, his love forhis family, his humour in the face of death and his profoundphilosophy is truly memorable.  Moreover, Phoenix plays such aconvincing villain that he forever more will be ingrained in my memoryas a &quot;drip.&quot; In addition, the musical score for this filmpossesses a certain irony as it swells into epic song in the mostgruesome parts.  Best of all is the ending.  Although it was fairlyobvious that Maximus would fulfill the former emperor's legacy, theway the film turned out was a pleasant surprise....Parts of this filmwere surreal and others were brutally &quot;real,&quot; for lack ofbetter definition.  As it is, this film is one that I plan onpurchasing for my permanent collection.	5.0	Excellent!	2001-02-21	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A35A2QY925G38E	Jedi Princess	This movie struck an emotional chord with me that no other movie has before.  Russell Crowe's magnetic performance anchors the spectacular action.But this is not just an action flick.  As a matter of fact, I hate action movies.  I seriously despised Braveheart.  I rented this movie expecting to hate it.  By the time the ending credits rolled, I was shaking in my chair from the sheer emotional impact and the catharsis of it all.Gladiator is an adrenaline rush from start to finish.  It's simply wonderful.  By the time I'd watched it three or four times, I started to notice how well-crafted everything is:  the cinematography, the art direction, and most especially the musical score.  But the first two times, it was a pure emotional experience.  My #1 all-time favorite.	5.0	An emotional trip. . .	2001-04-21	2	0	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2DFXDM36L75P2	"Jeff Davis ""Jeff"""	Ridley Scott has given us a lot of great movies, like Blade Runner and Alien, but Gladiator is probably his biggest mainstream hit and for good reason.  The story of Maximus is a human, entertaining one, the depiction of Rome is the best we've yet seen (thanks to some digital imagery)and as a result, as viewers we really do feel transported to that time and place.  I think some of the history is flat out wrong, like the ending which suggests that Rome will become a Republic again (yeah, right!), but hey, you can't have everything.  I will say this, for all it's glories maybe the movie is a tad overlong, but that's hardly to be mentioned when compared to the magnificence of the opening battle sequence and the tension of the rounds in the colosseum with the gladiators fighting for life and death.  I hear there's going to be a sequel, but it will have to take place in Tartarus...	5.0	Modern Classic	2005-11-01	3	1	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	With the era of Roman Empire movies gone for so long, the public was aching for this movie so bad, but they didn't even know it, until they saw it.  Thank god Ridley Scott has made an incredible movie that is not just something to fill that aching void.  This movie is as epic and glorious as they come.  The Roman Empire was built on brutal force and conquering of lesser civilizations.  It is made abundantly clear in the beginning as the Roman army, in full force, take on the resisting Germanians (German Barbarians), with one commander stating 'People should know when they are conquered'.  Russell Crowes character, The General Maximus, replies, 'Would you?  Would I?'  This sets the tone as Russell so skillfully plays a Military Hero who desperately wants to go home to his farm and spend the rest of his days with his family.  In true Roman loyalty though, he is asked by the Ceaser to take his place, played very well by Richard Harris, who could easily leave this as his final role.Maximus' journey from here is not a pretty one.  Typical Roman behavior ensues.  Murder, betrayal, lies, politics....Crowe plays his charater so well in placing Maximus' desires so close to reality.  He is the one grounded personality in a pit full of snakes.  It seems this movie takes place at a time closer to the fall of the empire.  With that comes much political intrigue as well as bloody violence as the games get started.  Vengance is the driving force behind Crowe's character.  He plays it so well that for once, the villian, Joaquin Phoenix finally doesn't outact the hero.  Nonetheless, everyone plays their roles so skillfully and the direction is still incredible.  Ridley Scott hasn't had a project this juicey in years and he seemed to master every detail.  The recreation of Rome is awesome, especially the Colliseum. A feat attributed to the incredible advancement of computer graphics.  The atmosphere is almost that of any modern day sporting event, only more blood and no multi-million dollar contracts.  Scott stays clear of Roman stereotypes like fig leaves and togas and gives a more realistic look at the Roman society.  Dangerous, bloody, deceitful.  Gladiator succeeds on so many levels that it was no wonder Scott was granted the job of bringing Hannibal Lecture back to the big screen.  This timeless director of such great movies like Alien and Blade Runner seems to have found new motivation.  The extra material alone is worth the price of buying this movie.	5.0	This is not your father's Roman Empire movie.	2001-01-14	0	0	0

From the incestuous, mad Commodus to his counterpart, the honest, fearless Roman General, Maximus Decimus Meridus, and everyone in between. I've watched this movie about 12 times, and haven't seen a mistake yet.Connie Nielsen as Lucilla is breathtaking.  She posesses maximum amounts of intelligence, grace, and beauty.  There isn't a man alive who wasn't intrigued when she tells Maximus, &quot;Maximus, I still remember you in my prayers.  Oh yes, I pray.&quot;Another standout in a great cast is Oliver Reed.  Damn, he was a good actor.  Just look at his face when he's telling Maximus about the colluseum.  &quot;50,000 Romans, following every move of your sword.  And the rise, and cheer, as if, as if you're the Thunder God himself.&quot;The acting, story, and sets in this movie are all astounding.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A30500AYVMAR9O	Jeremy	I'm still quite surprised at the praise heaped onto &quot;Gladiator&quot; - even film critics I admire seem to believe that it represents the second coming of epic filmmaking. I could not disagree more - &quot;Gladiator&quot; is a terrible movie, a lumbering dunce of a film parading around like the next &quot;Ben Hur.&quot; Russell Crowe is appropriately sinewy as Maximus and Richard Harris makes a fine Marcus Aurelius (if he were from the British Isles, that is), but everything else is so contrived as to be suffocating. Everything in the film is big and dumb and loud, and the producers apparently believed that an utterly abysmal script would be compensated by scenes of surprisingly dull, clanging combat, usually consisting of two armored men slinging swords around until somebody gets stabbed and falls over (and maybe a computer generated tiger is thrown in from time to time). I would have expected more creativity from Ridley Scott, but &quot;Gladiator&quot; reminds me most of &quot;Braveheart&quot; - it desperately wants to be a great film, but it simply doesn't have the script, talent, or purpose to be anything more than a glorified popcorn movie. I'm absolutely amazed that everyone I know worships this film...but to me, beneath Russell Crowe's charisma, the mock historical lesson, and the earsplitting battle scenes, there is absolutely nothing of consequence.	2.0	Sprawling Cinematic Fluff	2000-11-06	21	8	13

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1D4LOBQFWWWCH	Jerry Dang	I must admit that I really liked this movie the first time I saw it on the big screen. I liked it so much that I saw it again. I bought the DVD when it was released way back when. I popped the DVD in the other day to watch it again and I could not watch more than 20 minutes of it.The opening battle scene is impressive and exciting along with the excellent score. But the dialogue was too much (or too little) -- corny, pretentious, SHALLOW, and outright ridiculous. Every word that Maximus says is sooo politically correct and he's so gooder than good. Every line that Commodus utters is so nefarious (in the shallowest of ways) and he's presented as the epitome of evil. But the character development doesn't cut it -- like the 95% of all movies made today. Watch the movie. These guys sit around and try to say the most meaningful and insightful things in as few lines as possible. But it doesn't mean anything. The scenes involving the two senators talking about the games and any conversation between Commodus and Lucilla are perfect examples. They try to pass these conversations off as deep and revealing, but they make me gag over how stupid they are. I noticed these things when I watched it the first time, but I overlooked them because I wanted to enjoy the movie and not critique it too much. I can't do that anymore. It's not in my nature.The special effects are so overdone. They're impressive in the fakest sense. I watched Spartacus again before I watched Gladiator again, and there is no comparison. Gladiator ripped off so much from Spartacus, but the result is so cheesey. Spartacus took its time to develop the characters while Gladiator just introduced some traits and assumed that the audience would accept the rest--I don't think so. Spartacus is complex and straightforward at the same time. Lawrence Olivier, Kirk Douglas, Peter Ustinov, Jean Simmons, and the rest of the cast were excellent. There were good good guys, mean good guys, so-so guys that were both good and bad (Peter Ustinov's Batiatus), and bad guys that were still somewhat good if you understood them (Lawrence Olivier's Crassus). I could go on and on. Watch the movie. The end scene between Olivier and Simmons is worth the price alone -- beautiful acting and moving drama. Then watch Gladiator -- MERCY!	2.0	This movie is at best OK	2001-05-23	3	1	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1Q7329LOIJG6M	Jerry Fry	This story is set in ancient Rome around 180 A.D. Marcus Aurelius is the aging emperor and Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a great general who has won many battles. Marcus (Richard Harris) loves him like a son and more than his own son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Marcus intends to make Maximus emperor to be but Commodus kills Marcus before this be known. He works to destroy Maximus, but Maximus escapes and rides swiftly to his home where he finds his wife and son murdered. Overcome with grief and exhaustion, he lies unconcious on the ground and is later taken by slave traders and sold to a former gladiator (Oliver Reed)  and must fight in the arena as a gladiator if he wants to live. He lives only for revenge, to one day kill Commodus. Maximus and his pack of gladiators become well known and come to Rome to fight in the Coliseum. They defy incredible odds and utterly destroy a horde of gladiators in chariots. Maximus becomes the crowd's favorite. They chant his name in the arena. The scenes in the arena with the gladiators are quite grisly but are some of the best scenes in the movie.  Marcus's daughter loves Maximus and plots to destroy Commodus. Commodus is an evil man with evil deeds to his credit. He lusts after his sister and has spies to keep him well informed. Maximus gets his chance at revenge, Commodus doesn't want to make him a martyr.	4.0	History in the Making	2003-05-17	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3B9MQKJYF8MJX	Jerry Kim	From the moment the preview slammed the television sets and the movie theaters with 'Bawitdaba' by Kid Rock, I knew this was going to be a hit...and not just a small one. I guess in Ancient Rome, they didn't do anything small, and in this example of the Gladiator games that took place during those times, they really DIDN'T do anything small. Director Ripley Scott has a classic on his hands and he knows it. The story follows Maximus (Russell Crowe, who is not exactly known for his action credentials) a Roman general who is deemed a traitor and made into a participant in one of the most brutal contests of all time. Joaquin Phoenix's performance almost makes you want to reach out and smack the living daylights out of him (which means he did a great job in his role). Ridley Scott's masterful work behind the camera is evident from the opening scene, eerily foreshadowing the rest of the movie. What this means I leave to you to find out. Worth the money for DVD? Without a doubt. The surround sound will make you shiver with anticipation as the roar of the crowd at the Roman Coliseum is enough to almost make a man wet his pants...both in the movie and out of. Just one thing to keep in mind, this movie is NOT for the faint of heart. Be ready for a wham-bam, sense-slamming experience that isn't without it's portion of beheadings (and with two swords!).

Russel Crowe does a magnificent job, as does Joaquin Phoenix(brother of River)in the role of Commodus.  Now that we are on the subject of Commodus, this movie is somewhat historically accurate, seeing as Commodus actually fought in gladiatorial battles claiming over one thousand victories in his lifetime, and was planning on moving into the gladiatorial barracks prior to his assassination at the hands of his family, though not Lucilla.  Lucilla had tried to have him assassinated, but he figured it out, and had her put to death.  But, this movie rocks, so, I encourage you to buy it.  And the soundtrack.

I do remember though walking out of the theater and thinking to myself I have got to have this one on DVD.Well I have it now, and have probably watched it 15+ times.  The acting is very good for an epic-action movie, and the special effects of Rome are surrealistic.  You don't have to be a fan of Ancient Rome to enjoy this movie, in fact students of Med civilizations may chafe at the idea of a Roman General turning Slave to Gladiator to killing the Emperor.  This movie makes that idea work though.The drama between characters is thick enough to cut with a knife. To my immense surprise Joachim Phoenix played the part of Commodus to perfection...His contribution to the movie surpassed any of the other actors/actresses in my opinion.I would recommend this movie to anyone, and if you have a good surround system it's all the better, the musical score blends very well with the action, and the drama.  The cinematography has been very well done, especially the scene where Commodus is riding into Rome for the first time to the Senate building...the use of a slightly blue filter adds to the effect so well.Ok.

It is documented MANY times that the emporer would enter battle against man and beast and the crowd would love it. This movie has a shallow plot, which isnt a bad thing, great acting, which is a good thing, increadible fight scenes, which is a good thing, emotional characters, good thing, and an ending that people SHOULD have expected from an epic. While it would have been great to see Maximus enter Rome with his army, anyone who thought he would was seriously blind to the movie.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A258O0KFLNZBSC	Jigen	There has been so much mentioned of the fine acting, the beautiful cinematography and the emotional impact this film can have that I won't bother mentioning it except to say I agree.Some other things I think are noteworthy are the director's choices and style. The film, though filled with violence, tends to give a sense of violence rather than show it. Most of today's filmmakers show everything and leave little to the imagination. Ridley Scott more artfully shows unclear snippets of awful things in a frenzied vortex of fighting that becomes translated in the mind of imaginative viewers to the full horrors of battle.Ridley Scott is one of the few directors besides George Lucas who understands the visual medium of film. He crams in layer upon layer of things to look at and explore. It's just as much fun seeing what's happening in the background as the foreground. The colors, lighting and compositions make this much like viewing a succession of paintings. And like Lucas he understands and keeps the special effects to a respectable story-telling tool rather than the tedious and distracting events (like the over-the-top effects in The Matrix) they become in the hands of lesser directors .This film also taps into several of the themes raised and explored in the director's earlier masterpiece, Bladerunner (see it if you haven't). Marcus Aurelius is like the Tyrell character, both are destroyed by the 'prodigal son' in a very similar manner (and the same gorgeous lighting)as they curse themselves for their poor fatherhood. The relationship between Maximus and the new Emperor are similar to Deckard and Batty in Bladerunner: They are like brothers, one the shadowy reflection of the other, drawn to a fateful showdown of allegorical proportions.The film is peppered with philosophical and social commentary that predicts the downfall of Rome, but more importantly speaks volumes of the way things are headed in the U.S.A., the current mighty empire of the world. Rome fell because people were indifferent, paying for a mighty army without knowing what they were paying for, wasting countless hours watching meaningless sporting events (think of all those who shamelessly tune in Monday Night Football) and generally slumping into a cesspit of greed and stupidity (like the stock market and television today). When Marcus Aurelius talked about the dream that was Rome, it reminded me of the founding father's dream for America; the outcome being vastly different when the dream becomes co-opted by the selfish and greedy. Equality, my eye!The film has a refreshing outlook on death. In the U.S.A. we tend to look upon death as failure, something to be feared and avoided. This film showed it as the logical conclusion to life. We all face the same fate, it's how you live your life that matters. You can be the hero, a thinker, honest, not asking for more than you need, making your family your priority, a good and just individual standing up for your beliefs and values. Or you can be the villain, selfish, greedy, needy, self-absorbed, an unlikable fellow who cares more about what other people think than about what is right or wrong.This film appeals to both the regular Hollywood movie watcher, filled with action, heroics, exotic places and sights, and also to those who search look to find a greater meaning for life in the films they watch. This is probably what confuses critics, who seek only to classify films to make their jobs easier; they like to consider a film either art-house or general release, leading to a pointless snobbery. Thankfully we have a handful of directors like Ridley Scott who ignore those categories and make films that ultimately can have a broader and timeless appeal.	5.0	A return to epic filmmaking	2000-09-22	7	6	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A39DSTPPDDOHKU	Jiger X	"Despite the overall good rating this film gets, I'm surprised at the number of picky and outright unfavorable reviews it's received.True, it's not quite flawless; it has at least one plot glitch I can think of, and it is framed upon the dear old stock B-movie revenge fantasy (which was NOT invented by Shakespeare--it was a tried and true formula long before he got to it.  And while we're at it, I can't say I noticed anything Shakespearean, pseudo or otherwise, about the film's dialogue, either).  But that's just about it for flaws.The movie is about dealing with the reality of death.  How to face one's own death.  How to cope with the loss of loved ones. What is worth the sacrifice of death. What happens after death; the movie firmly and plainly affirms the idea of an afterlife.  The movie does this not just with dialogue, but with imagery, music, and mood.The filmmakers knew enough not just to deal with such subjects on their own merits; the film would have been limited to PBS showings if they had.  They knew, as Proximo did, that they had to entertain to get it across to a wide audience.Did they succeed in blending high themes with blockbuster entertainment?  (For that matter, how many blockbusters bother to try at all?) I'll say they did.  Even most of its detractors will concede the action elements.  But if you haven't seen this, do so, or if you have and missed out on what it was really trying to do, give it a another try.  And as you're watching it, if you've followed along with the movie's real themes about how one comports oneself in the face of the reality of death--one's own as well as that of others--then you too will feel it right in the gut, as I did, at the end when Lucilla says ""You're home""."	5.0	Shadows and Dust...	2004-01-26	2	2	0

I have seen GLADIATOR 11 times and it only gets better........ well, that's kind of impossible since nothing can really get better than GLADIATOR, but you know what I mean. Russell Crowe is one AMAZING actor, he portrayed Maximus with perfection. Every actor and actress in this movie is AMAZING!

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1KGCH50H9NB68	Jimmy Hoffa	They didn't know much about Russell Crowe or Ridley Scott - they do NOW!!!! Really great film. Limited in scope, Dated a bit on the special effects. I absolutely love seeing my one of my old favorites Oliver Reed in this - superior work - he died during production and in some scenes it's him, and in some its the CGI him - see if you can tell which. Good cast, good production values, Creepy bad guy in Phoenix - I realize he's a great actor, but he's so bad it makes me like the film less. The idea of our gladiator returning to his family and the shots of the fields and their idea of the afterlife and the shot on his moving body after death are classic - I wanted them to see that effects. So many of these shots are in video games now - I wanted them to see just how unoriginal they are - that this is primary source, and this is an OLD movie by their standards - helps them to see things in a new light.	5.0	I had to share this with my kids`	2013-12-31	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	"Jim ""Pimmy"""	Gladiator has been called unworthy of the best picture Oscar is got by many critics. At one time I thought it was great but not Best Picture worthy as well. However now that I think about it, it deserved it. Okay the WWE like announcing of the Gladiators is silly like critic Roger Ebert made referrence to. He had other problems with the movie none were solid reasons not to like it. Here's all the reasons to like it. The cast is strong especially Russel Crowe in the lead, the direction is excellent, the story is well told and the battle scenes are fantastic. Okay the movie uses a lot of Special Effects for Rome when old movies like Ben-Hur were made impressively without such technology being available at the time. So what though, whether you think the visuals  look good or not they don't hold the movie down and they aren't what make the movie so strong anyway.The movie is still one of the most entertaining movies you'll see and it's a shame that Roger Ebert sat down and picked it apart because there's nothing that makes it bad...at all. Ok some things might be un-accurate to the time period.  Still though if you ignore such things and let the story and Russel Crowe's performance take hold of you I don't see how it's possible not to like it then. The supporting work by Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, the late great Oliver Reed and late great Richard Harris are all fine as well. My point is that despite minor flaws Gladiator is still a very good movie and deserved that Best Picture award!	4.0	Why it deserved Best Picture	2004-02-07	1	1	0

Everybody has already mentioned the dazzling visuals, so I need not go on further. Great action, great fight scenes.But the acting ranges from melodramatic to slightly less melodramatic, and the script is pure cheesiness at its worst. The movie has no depth at all, which is why most sane people question why it won an Oscar for Best Picture. The lesson in this movie is ""If you have a problem, kill somebody."" They say this (almost literally) several times within the movie, which just makes it seem like it was conceived/written by a six year old.If you are just looking for some action scenes, then here ya go.

Like the Patriot, however, some of the realities of the period are stretched just a little bit.  It isn't supposed to be a documentary.  If you are looking for an action movie to get your adrenaline pumping, then see this movie.

Though the film is quite long, you lose track of time while watching and it passes like seconds, leaving you wanting more.  Not only is the film interesting, it is also beautiful. The director uses images like Maximus' (Crowe) hand running over stalks of golden wheat and red flower petals falling from above in the arena to create a deeper meaning in scenes. You certainly can't go wrong with a film that combines heroism, survival, blood, and beauty. A must see film!	5.0	I Came, I Saw, It Conquered	2000-11-12	3	1	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2SCSS4OAQZ0CY	"""jkeyv"""	This movie was bold and delightful and the action was intense and manly. In most minds it was violent and brutal. I found this to be true but inbetween that I fell in love with the consistent imagery most certainly brought together by the visual nature and general dark and dusty color of most of the filming and most certainly the amazing scoring of the film. The soundtrack like in most masterpieces completes this film giving it the added reoccuring nature of the plot. It was inspiring and certainly led me to believe that this movie would not have been the same without Zimmer on the project. He was masterful and certainly many scenes became epic with his help. I believe the calming nature of the vocals and background music blended into the time and certainly gave the aspect of reality of music to the film. I need this soundtrack as I feel it can take me back to the imagery of the movie and certainly can intrigue many minds.If you haven't seen this movie I truely suggest it. However don't just watch it but listen to it and I feel you to will fall in love with its grand nature. I will forever remember the grain fields as a place I would be calm and serene in.This is not meant to down play the actors and actresses of this movie or the special effects.

The protagonist is your basic paladin-type filled with honor and truthfulness, which led to his problems. The villain is very well realized to a point that I wished that the protag. would destroy him in grand fashion. He is THAT despicable! Every character had his/her strength... I didn't care too much for the always-weeping sister to the antagonist, but that's just a minor problem. The fights were very enjoyable (pardon me for using the term &quot;enjoyable&quot; for people being slaughtered) and believable.

But surprise, surprise, the story was engrossing enuff that she got caught up in it and really liked it. It also exceeded my expectations - who knew a summer blockbuster could have so much depth to it?  On the technical side, if you have a decent home theater set up, the DTS soundtrack on this is truely awesome and worth the price of admission. Near the beginning of the film, some soldiers take Russell Crowe out into the woods to kill him. He grabs a sword and gets out their grasp and is hiding offscreen behind a tree. When he throws the sword at the soldier that you see on screen, the sound of the sword whirring thru the air almost makes you duck as it comes from the rear right surround and crosses to the front right to the center channel and into the soldiers chest.

I'm sticking with my DVD edition for now. For more detail on specifics of all the issues see the discussion on the AVS Forum & the review at The Digital Bits - looks like we will all have to wait a couple of years until the studio's concerned with this release (Paramount & Universal) do a new edition and remaster the original without all the excessive DNR, EE, and such!

Everything about this movie harkens to the classic epics of Hollywood.  Don't mistake admiration for theft though, this movie is pure 21st century and very original.Through the lavish use of computer graphics, as well as masterful costume work, the viewer is vaulted back to ancient Rome.  Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix both offer Oscar caliber performances, and the supporting cast is likewise excellent (of particular note is Djimon Hounsu of &quot;Amistad&quot;).  The film is packed with action, but also relates a tale of political intrigue, and also deftly deals with issues of love and faith.  Finally, the soundtrack is outstanding; in particular, some of the vocal arrangements are nothing short of haunting.As for the DVD, it offers some outstanding feautures.  I particularly enjoyed the TLC documentary on gladiatorial games, which does much to ground the movie in some historical fact.  I also enjoyed the deleted scenes with commentary from the director.  I enjoyed them all for what they added to the film, but I really liked the insight into the editing process that Scott's comments provided.	5.0	An amazing movie in the best Hollywood tradition	2001-01-23	7	4	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3VV4GUGLUVUP1	Joel R. Bryan	Make no mistake- this is Russell Crowe's movie. His performance as a Roman general-turned-slave carries this movie over top and makes its script flaws forgiveable. It also helps this movie avoid the laughable &quot;men-in-skirts&quot; syndrome that befalls so many Hollywood epics set in Classical times.Crowe begins the film as heroic and victorious Maximus, Emperor Marcus Aurelius' favorite. Maximus leads his legions to victory in a battle sequence that simply must be seen to be believed- many aptly compared it to &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; It trumps Stanley Kubrick's &quot;Spartacus&quot; finale for terror and realism, if not for scale and spectacle. Within a few short scenes after Maximus' triumph, Joaquin Phoenix, as Commodus, usurps the throne and Maximus escapes and flees to Spain to find his beloved family murdered. Wounded, he ends up in Africa (a confusing transition that would've benefitted from at least one image of a ship) under the care of Oliver Reed. Maximus becomes the greatest gladiator of them all, which leads him to Rome and a showdown with Commodus.In between are some amazing scenes of gladiatorial combat, where dust and blood mingle. One scene in particular stands out: Maximus isn't interested in putting on a show; as a soldier, he killed out of necessity. Now, he must kill for the pleasure of debauched crowds. After dispatching his foes, he angrily hurls his sword into a luxury box and taunts the crowd, then throws down his other sword and angrily spits into the sand. This is Russell Crowe at his finest, in a brutal action sequence with emotional content, where his character's pain and loss coalesce with the crowd's bloodlust to produce a dramatic and utterly believable gesture of contempt.Joaquin Phoenix manages to convey a man driven to excess by his father's indifference towards his existence, and his slide into insanity, without sacrificing all sympathy for Commodus. Never mind that the movie's story owes more to Caligula and that the political scenes can't match those in &quot;Spartacus&quot; for veracity and labyrintine plotting- this is a rousing, gut-wrenching spectacle with a human center and plenty of emotion. Not only that, its recreation of the Colosseum is awe-inspiring.The DVD provides a neat bundle of extras (storyboards, commentary, a documentary on gladiators and deleted scenes among others) that greatly enhance a marvelous, action-packed film. This is one of those movies for which this technology was created.With Oliver Reed in his last role as Proximo, Maximus' owner-mentor, an excellently restrained Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius (great emperor, so-so father) and Connie Nielson as Commodus' sister and would-be love interest.	5.0	Maximum Maximus	2001-01-22	19	15	4
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AVLJGDXO0ZZKI	joe smo	"Gladiator was released back in May of 2000 and quickly became a box-office smash and was certainly one of the biggest films of the summer.  I remember how thrilled I was while viewing it at the cinema.  It soon earned a lot of oscar nominations and took home 5 Academy Awards including Best Picutre and Best Actor, unfortunately Director Ridley Scott did not take home an oscar because he lost to Steven Soderbergh for ""Traffic.""Russell Crowe stars as the general Maximus in this exciting epic.  Joaquin Phoenix delivers a superb performance as the evil emperor Commodus.  Connie Nielson, Djimon Honsou, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris all deliver fine performances too in supporting roles.  This film is a grand epic, featuring wonderful and exciting fight sequences, beautiful sets and locations and of course great direction.Many comparisons have made to ""Braveheart,"" and well they don't seem entirely just, I love Braveheart and coincidentally it also won 5 Academy Awards, but I feel they are both excellent films and two stand-out epics.  THey are certainly two of the best epics that have come out in the last 10 years.  Also many comparisons have made between this film, ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy.""While I did enjoy ""Troy,"" and thought it was a tremendously entertaining film, I feel that ""Gladiator"" was a more substantial film with a better script and better acting.  In terms of action, well that's hard to say.  Both deliver excellent action sequences, but Troy's action sequences are bigger, considering some of the action sequences are major battles.Overall this film is a beautiful movie, with an excellent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard and is certainly much better than Troy's soundtrack by James Horner, though that isn't a terrible soundtrack.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A34JM8T3P5G3IA	joeygb	I think some of you missed the whole &quot;entertainment&quot; value of this movie. I think some people put way too much emphasis on historical value to this movie. When I went to see this movie, I went to see a movie about a &quot;gladiator&quot;, hence the movie title &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Hmm, no brainer. I wasn't expecting to see a movie about historical Rome (thankfully), otherwise the movie would of been called...hmm, maybe &quot;Rome&quot;? Also, I never saw &quot;Based on true events&quot; anywhere, or &quot;...the most historically accurate movie about Rome&quot; or &quot;..gladiators&quot;, so I never expected these things. I loved the story, and the action scenes. I loved the entertainment value of it being a movie, not a documentary. So for all the reviewers who bashed the ones who enjoyed the movie by calling them &quot;moronic&quot;, who's the moronic ones? The ones who went out to watch a movie about a &quot;Gladiator&quot; and got their money's worth out of it, or the ones who paid to watch a movie about a &quot;Gladiator&quot; thinking they were getting a documentary on Rome?	5.0	Take the movie for what it's worth- a movie	2001-06-26	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ANM4I38VRP1VR	John Bolier	Gladiator is a remarkable film.  It lavishly recreates the glory and decadence of the Roman Empire. Gladiator's central character is the Roman general Maximus (Russell Crowe).  The ailing Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), decides to pass his powers to Maximus, to the consternation of his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).  Upon Aurelius' death Commodus becomes emperor.  This is the point in the story where Maximus' livelihood takes a turn for the worse.The action scenes in Gladiator are outstanding.  The performances were Oscar caliber.  Russell Crowe has the best screen presence of any actor I've seen.  His academy award was well deserved.  Joaquin Phoenix was riveting as the scheming Commodus.  Phoenix was one of the best screen villians I have seen in a long time.  It's a shame he did not win an Oscar as well.Many people complain that Gladiator is nothing more than well choreographed action sequences.  This could not be further from the truth.  I've seen this film five times and I get a little more out of it with each viewing.  Gladiator is a story of two men, Maximus and Commodus, vying for the love and respect of their fellow citizens.  I highly recommend this dvd.	5.0	Gladiator-Deserving of Best Picture	2001-03-30	4	2	2

The fight scene with the tigers was visually spectacular, but that doesn't make up for a drudgingly dull plot &amp; awful acting from Russell Crowe.  He Is, in my opinion, the single most over-rated actor in the last 20 years.  He has gone above and beyond when it comes to OVER ACTING, none of his roles that I've seen have been convincing OR entertaining.  I am certainly not qualified to critisize an actor and nobody may find my review to be helpful, but I have to be honest in my opinions and mine is this:  THIS MOVIE IS A STINKER!	1.0	Best Picture?

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2YD10HUU2IBHR	John Dolan	You wouldn't expect gladiatorial combat to be worth watching. It's been the subject of thousands of one-panel cartoons, sportswriting allegories, and pedophile come-ons (Remember the pilot in Airplane asking, &quot;Jimmy, do you like gladiator movies?&quot;)So it's a bit of a surprise that most of the combat scenes in this film play pretty well. Oh, there are quibbles: the lions and tigers look like they've been given Xanax-laced burgers, and despite fitful attempts to invoke real Roman custom (Crowe's prayers to his ancestors) the American nuclear family is still the basic unit of pathos.But most of it is beautiful, in an uncanny way. The great battle scene at the start of the film is like a pre-industrial Apocalypse Now shot, as the Roman catapults literally napalm the treeline. It's an interesting way of reimagining the Roman way of making war, and it's not actually such an implausible one. They were a fearsomely adaptable and ruthless people, and the film deserves credit for making them, and their bloodsports, something more than a tired punchline.One thing, though: Oliver Reed. Aaaiiee! The man is magical: whenever he appears onscreen, suspension of disbelief collapses. I await the day he and Keanu Reeves play opposite each other; the very fabric of the Universe may well collapse!	4.0	Apocalypse Then	2000-11-24	2	2	0

That little boy lucius. I can't remember his name but i read his journal and what an experience he had, with all the luxury and barbeques and the bonding between him, Russell, Connie, Ralf, and sven. also when he met Arnold Schwarzenager(or however you spell it) After the emotion he put into his journal he must of been extremely sad to leave the set after shooting. I mean he got to meet Russell Crowe. i could only dream. and work out with a Mr. Universe.

Sounds like the same Zulu soundbite repeated at varying times.Then I replayedZulu (1964]) [Blu-ray]. The part(s) of the Zulu soundtrack used in Gladiator comes from 01:09:45 to 01:10:46 in Zulu. The Zulu are rushing the fort, but only to allow the Chief to count the British rifles. The Zulus smash their spears against their shields and cry, ""uSuthu!"". Their leader says something like, ""BOONG, WATREECE!"" and the Zulu rush forward saying something like, ""Yah!"" or ""Yo!"", the leader repeats, the Zulu repeat. That's exactly what's on the Gladiator soundtrack....and from Wiki: ""The Germanic war chant in the battle scene at the beginning of Ridley Scott's film Gladiator is the Zulu war chant from Zulu.

The Gladiator is a movie about duty and honor, but it is tragic as the main character never really...well, you will have to see the movie for that (if you haven't) and if you have, then your getting angry or filling in the blank where I left off has made my point.  You could not stop.  You knew it by heart.  You knew the Gladiator.  You others can know it too.  Only remember this:  it was not being a Gladiator that made him great; it was his character.

The way that the gladiators trained and fought was really true to life. There was much more fighting with animals though, which was left out. I was hesitant to see this at the movies, because I thought it would be some cheezy depiction of over-glorified Roman life. Boy was I wrong.

Ridley Scott did a great job in getting this movie to where it is now in motion picture history, and sadly missed out on a Best Director Oscar, which was an injustice in my opinion.  This 3 disc set has an Extended Edition by 17 or so minutes.  I was a little dissapointed that the little bit with the lions attacking the people wasn't put back in.  I remembered that from the old DVD.  Disc 2 has a great documentary about the making of the film that's pretty substantial, covering aevery aspect of production.  The segment about the ""resurrection"" of Oliver Reed is especially interesting.  The special effects team had to re-do several shots of Oliver Reed and adjust the lighting and colors to make it seem like he was in a different place.  They also had a few shots where his face was placed over a double's body.  I'd say they did a pretty good job.  Disc 3 has some deleted scenes and an alternate opening credits which are interesting, some stills and some trailers.

The only thing I did not like about the DvD was the 2 cd set; one CD is the movie and the other is the extra scenes and director commentary. I would have preferred them be on 1 CD.Russell Crowe plays Maximus Desmus Meridius, the Commander of the Roman armies of the North. After a successful campaign in Germania, Emperor Marcus Arellius (played by Richard Harris) tells Maximus that he wants him to be Emperor of Rome after Arellius' death for a short time, only to proclaim the Senate will rule Rome, making it a republic. This news is not good for the Emperors son, Comidus played by Joaquin Phoenix. So what does the son do? Kill the father and ask Maximus to join him. Maximus of course refuses and Comidus commands Maximus' execution (as well as his families). Maximus escapes and races towards his family, but he is too late. Maximus collapses due to his grief and is acquired by a travelling caravan as a slave. He is quickly sold as a gladiator to Proximo (I forget the actor's name) and the games begin. After an intense victory in the Colliseum, Emperor Comidus wants to meet this incredible gladiator (Maximus has a mask on while they re-create the battle of Maxia). Comidus demands Maximus to remove his helmet and after he does, Maximus tells Comidus that he will avenge the murder of his son and wife. There is political intrigue and action gallore.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A5H8VLE7L7SB	Jose	Politics, blood, battles, action, are just a few elements that this huge epic movie provides. It's not another Ben-Hur, it is The Gladiator. The Visual Effects and sound, are the best ones I've seen and heard. It's not only a 12 oscar nominee and 5 oscar winner including Best Picture, it is the best epic movie ever made. You are taken to Rome, into the battles, the politics and the Coliseum. This DVD is simply one of the best. The DTS Surround Sound, (for those who have a DTS Surround Sound DVD), is awsome, the movie sound effects are so good, that when you combine it with them, you really hear every single movement of the sword, just like if you were a roman having fun in the Coliseum, and for those who don't have a DTS Surround Sound DVD, the Surround Sound is still excellent. But appart from the movie and the sound, this two DVD disc set gives you the Barbarian extras. The Commentary by Ridley Scott is worth of your time, and the HBO First Look Making Of, is more than interesting. But the parts I most enjoyed were the 25 minutes of Deleted Scenes and 7 minute montage of additional unused footage extras. Althogh the movie is not as deep as it could, Joaquin Phoenix gives an excellent performance as the Cesar, and gives the sense of Politics in such a way, that you enjoy the story of power that comes between him and Maximus. The scene where Comodus confronts his father is amazing, and the Am I not Merciful? scene provides an amazing feeling of madness surrounding Comodus. The Batlle scene, the Coliseum scene and the City of Rome scene proves that Ridley Scott is one of the best directors ever. The music that the master Hans Zimmer made for the movie is shocking, and the most important thing of all, in one way or another, you enjoy the movie, the story, the music, and many other details.	5.0	What we do in Life, goes in eternity...	2001-03-29	11	9	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1TKM36EYEQNSM	Joseph J.

It shows the respect an army has for its leader and reveals a respect for the soldier at first.  Yet, you will see when the one who is ultimately in charge desires, followers will do as they are told, nothing asked, to destroy someone who was loyal.This movie made Crows career, and he made the movie a good one.  He was good in LA Confidential and great in this.The movie takes us to 4 locations, 5 if you count the Elysian fields.  You wonder if there will be a Spartacus type uprising after Maximus is revealed in Rome.  The portrayal of the Coliseum is magnificent.There are some clever scenes to the movie as well, well thought out interplays between the character and his or her actions.  You wonder if Maximus ever will get his revenge on the new Ceasar.From the first effects of a great battle with the German tribes in the north to the last scene in the Coliseum, this movie with its epic proportions will not dissappoint you.It is a movie of courage and endurance.  A good example of how someone who is at the end of their rope can more than hang on to live to conquer again.	4.0	Epic movie, but was it true?	2004-02-13	0	0	0

Russell Crowe sucessfully carries on the sword-and-sandal tradition with this star-making performance, bringing a newfound realism that past epics like 'Ben-Hur' and 'Ten Commandments' lacked. The excellent cast, especially Joaquin Phoenix as the amoral Commodus, help to personify the debauchery and arrogance of ancient Rome, while Crowe delivers both as a man's-man and also as a humbled slave, defeated in life by Rome's excesses but redeemed in death by his devotion to family and honor.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1T40HDUXPA7RM	Josh C.	When one hears the name Ridley Scott, movies such as Alien, Blade Runner, Legend, and even Thelma &amp; Louise instantly come to mind. Time to add a new classic to that list, one of the biggest movies of the year 2000 - Gladiator.Gladiator is the story of one man, Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe). Maximus is a general of the Roman Empire, one who has never even been to Rome yet he controls the respect of the entire army and the people.The movie opens with a huge battle in Germania led by the great Maximus. You see the respect the troops give him, and you see him in midst of the battle. When the smoke clears, the Emperor Marcus Aurelious comes in to congratulate Maximus, which leads to him asking Maximus to take on the mantle of Caesar when the time comes.Of course, Marcus Aurelious has both a son (Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix) and daughter (Lucillia, played by Connie Nielson). When Commodus learns that he will not be Caesar, he murders his own father and takes on the job of Emperor. Naturally, Maximus knows that the Emperor was slain and did not die of natural causes, so he does to submit to the rule of Commodus.The new Emperor orders Maximus to be executed, but he didn't count on Maximus' ability to single handedly wipe out his executors and escape. Maximus rides through the desert as his family is executed by the Roman legion, and he eventually is taken into slavery and sold off as a gladiator.Maximus' owner is Proximo (Oliver Reed, in his final performance), who was also once a gladiator and won his freedom in the great coliseum of Rome. After Maximus proves himself in many battles, and becomes respected among the other gladiators (and something of a celebrity among the mob), Proximo packs him and the other top gladiators in a carriage and makes his way to Rome to find fortune and glory.All of this is going along exactly as Maximus wants. He wants only one thing - to face Commodus and get revenge. That single focus on revenge is really the core of the movie, as it centers mainly on Maximus.Gladiator is a huge story, and the description above only covers the first half of the movie. That is one of the problems with it, as it seems not trimmed enough. If they cut it down another fifteen minutes or so, it may have turned out a little better...but that is only a minor quibble with the film.Most of the performances are great, especially Richard Harris, who was nearly perfect as a Caesar in the twilight of his life. Russell Crowe simply rocks, Joaquin Phoenix pulled of the totally evil Caesar well, but the whiny little boy act gets kind of annoying (possibly some trimming in the movie would have solved this).Once Queen Amidala is gone...I will rule the Naboo.The CGI work that was done to recreate the Roman Empire toward the end of its life span is excellent. Streets teem with people, the coliseum roars, and everything looks amazing.The action scenes simply rock. These are gladiatorial battles as scene through the lens of no holds barred. They are intense, gory, and loud. The Battle of Carthage scene is awesome and worth the price of admission alone. In terms of action, this movie will rock you!Overall the movie has amazing action sequences, but a story that could have used a little trimming at the sides. Then again, most people don't go into a gladiator movie to critique it for a deep story - they want to see bones break and limbs fly. And then you look at Gladiator that way...it rocks.	5.0	The DVD That Will Rock You	2001-06-10	3	2	1

Gladiator was a generally good movie that could have been better. I saw two major problems: Action filming style and number of sentimental moments.  The action scenes were shot at two close a range and in most of the battle scenes used blurring affects that detracted from the viewers immersement; outweighing any artsy motivation. Toward the middle and end of the movie more of the action was seen from a distance; but often cut from one strike to another making it hard to realize the choreographing.  About the sentimental moments; the acting was wonderful and did pull on those heartstrings. My complaint is that there were just too many of those ""Powerful"" moments instead of building to a few main moments.  Quick note: Scenery and costumes were excellent and gave you an idea of the ""Glory of Rome"" might have looked like. All in all, I'm glad I saw it and enjoyed it - but wish I had rented it and not bought it first."	3.0	Good movie, but lacking...	2000-11-27	1	0	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1DJ6NF5RGBALZ	joshua saltzman	gladiator, general maximus, is a great warrior of body, mind and spirit.  a must see movie, For other uses, see Gladiator (disambiguation).Part of the Zliten mosaic from Libya (Leptis Magna), about 2nd century CE. It shows (left to right) a thraex fighting a murmillo, a hoplomachus standing with another murmillo (who is signaling his defeat to the referee), and one of a matched pair.A gladiator (Latin: gladiator, &#34;swordsman&#34;, from gladius, &#34;sword&#34;) was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their legal and social standing and their lives by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death.Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world.The origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the Punic Wars of the 3rd century BCE, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly games.	5.0	of the best movies	2014-03-27	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2ENIQZX6VJYUM	J. Robinson	I just took the time to see this movie, and now I finally understand the excitement. After renting, I bought the DVD. The DVD is excellent, both picture and sound, and it has good extras and interviews, including one with Crowe, one on the computer graphics, and one on the music.It is not your usual Hollywood movie and Crowe is simply outstanding - perhaps a modern day Bogart. In some ways it is like the old epic movies, and the movie is a good combination of writing, cinematography, acting, plus the magnet personality of Crowe. It is like an old fashion Hollywood Roman movie with the chariot scenes, but then again it has a much more complicated an unpredictable plot plus it mixes in a bit of the surreal. Simply a great movie thatI had to watch twice in a row on the first viewing. The only negative for some people will be the bloody fight scenes - but they add to our understanding of the dangers and the lives of the Roman troops and the gladiators.It is that good and easy to understand the excitement and the awards.	5.0	Great Movie	2005-12-24	2	2	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A84P2QF6L57YX	J. Rossi	This movie won best picture at the Oscars and I wasn't at all surprised, as the Acadamy tends to NOT award the best picture of the year with the honor.  A lot of people loved this movie and it's easy to see why:  an underdog lead character and loads of action.  I would have loved it too had it been as carefully crafted as Ben Hur.  However, it isn't, and the story is about as strong as wet tissue paper;  the sub-par story alone tries to support a new-era Hollywood epic and obviously turns to shreds.The whole of the movie is filler with some action sequences to break the monotony:  There's the &quot;driving factor&quot; of Maximus trying to free the slaves and restore the glorious empire, but who really cares except for Maximus?  Not me, and probably not most people.  And don't forget the tacked on love story, which seems obligatory for any Hollywood movie these days.  The pure and simple truth is that, sadly, no extra care was taken to ensure this movie's claim to greatness.When you put all these elements in a blender and hit &quot;puree&quot; you come up with a thick dark sludge that's as appetizing as raw liver, but which people will shell out money to taste nonetheless.  And despite what you may think of this next statement, there is no bitterness involved:  If you want to really see the best picture of the year, go see Traffic.	2.0	Three stars is too generous	2001-03-31	7	4	3
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2UAT3VS3ARGNH	"""jschwammwillis"""	This is the best movie. When i sat down to watch it, i excpected a gory,bloody movie with no plot line and bad actors(but good action.) When i finished i had loved it. It does have GREAT action but, the reason it is so good is this: Usuauly movies either have good action and bad actors + plot, or good actors + plot and bad action. This, had very good action, but it also had an enthralling plotline and GREAT actors. When i got out of the movie theaters, i relized that it was DEFINATly tied for my favorite movie(my other favorite one being dragon heart-cuz i have sentimentle value attached to that). But, this was an OUTSTANDING move and well worth the money. WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So, if you are hesitating to buy it, hesitate no longer.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2GB5CG77LGQRB	Jublistic	GladiatorScore: 87/100When you make a movie about gladiator's, there is a good chance it's going to be great, since gladiator's are an easy premise to make a good movie out of. But there hasn't been an excellent movie about gladiator's in a long time. Well, Gladiator, probably 2000's most praised movie, is going to change the fact, this is actually better than excellent.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a powerful Roman general, loved by the people and the aging Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death. The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies. The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge.Gladiator is tremendous filmmaking done in a superbly Old-Hollywood-Meets-New-Hollywood way, and although it's historically inaccurate, you won't really care because you'll be having so much fun. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are both Oscar-worthy as General Maximus and Emperor Commodus, and both hold the screen with such pure force that you can't rip your eyes away from their terrific expressions and heartfelt emotions. Ridley Scott's direction is full of effort and should be praised, and the set decorations are terrific.If you haven't seen this yet, which I doubt, go and rent it A.S.A.P.

WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE!  I have to agree that the movie thrived on violence what with the war at the start of the film &amp; the games at the Coliseum, but it also reeked of reality &amp; had some few good lessons to learn.  It glaringly pointed out on man's greed for power, the dirtiness of politics, the blind obedience of the army, man's refuge in entertainment to forget their own dismal existence even for short a time.  But it also gave hope to people knowing that there are still a few good men out there with unquestionable dignity, a true leader, living with principles, honor &amp; justice.I'll always remember Maximus' line re &quot;Stay with me.  If you see yourself walking alone in an open field, don't worry, you're already dead!&quot;  This may sound too morbid but it also shows you a part of his character.  An encouraging &amp; suportive general to his followers, a person who manages to exhibit humor at the scariest time of their life, a person who gives you hope to stay together &amp; see the worst through.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A13AOLW20F9GKU	Juliator	"First, let me say I love this movie, and was looking forward to see the extended edition on DVD. What a disappointment this re-edited version of the film has been! While the new packaging and the extra documentary features are OK, this new edition doesn't really add anything of interest. Let me list some of the problems I found with the Extended Edition:- First of all, no DTS soundtrack, which detracts a lot of value from any updated version of the film. The DTS track in the original DVD release was extraordinary, and it's difficult to understand why it is missing in this special edition.- The new Dolby Digital mix included in this Extended Edition is problematic. The middle/center channel seems much lower than the rest, so the conversations are barely audible at times, yet fights and action scenes are very loud. None of these problems existed in the original DVD release: both DTS and Dolby mixes were properly balanced. Not in this version. I compared them side by side and couldn't understand why they had messed up the mix so badly in this super-duper edition. It's not worth your cash.- The new edition of the film adds 17 minutes of footage that were left in the cutting floor. To tell you the truth, there's no compelling reason why those 17 minutes shouldn't remain in the cutting floor. These missing scenes really don't add much to the story, and hardly call for an ""extended edition."" I was hoping they were going to include the much talked about fight of Maximus with a rhino. Forget it! The extra 17 minutes are mainly conversations building up the political conspiracy going on in Rome.While some of the extra features are somewhat interesting, I found the Extended Edition to be a rip-off, and it hardly justifies the $29 they charge you for it. Stick to the original DVD, specially if you enjoy full-bodied DTS sound."	2.0	Extended Edition: Beware - Don't waste your money	2005-08-29	15	12	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3H4YBB2ZB5833	June G. Fearn	Gladiator was a movie on a grand scale.  Sometimes this culminated in awe-inspiring vistas and sweeping scenes.  Sometimes it left the lesser characters behind.  The story of a Roman general become fugitive become slave become gladiator, it paints a picture of life in the Roman empire as seen from several social levels and explores the gritty life of the gladiator.Crowe's character, Maximus, is oringal and a good mix of tough and tender.  Unfortunately most of the other characters are not written with such insight and come across as two dimensional.  This movie truly is carried by Crowe.  The plot is quite predictable at points but the end surprised even me (I have seen so many movies that I can easily spot a cookie cutter plot and usually know how it will end half way through).  It was a refreshing change.  The computer graphics were amazing, especially the shots of the Colesseum, and there was a good balance between the grand sweeping shots and the small private moments that really let the audience get to know the characters.  It would have helped if the moviemakers would have let the audience get closer to Phoenix's and Nielsen's characters but they seemed intent on making the first purely evil and the second a helpless victim.One thing that the movie did eccel at was recreating the glory and spectacle of the Roman Empire.  Roman culture was well represented and history well meet if stretched at points.  Another triumph of Gladiator was the soundtrack.  It provided a beautiful counterpoint to the big events and subtly underscored the smaller moments.  Plus it blended perfectly with the action in the battle scene and the death scene and really brought Elysium to life.Gladiator may not be on par with the other cinematic Roman spectacles but it is one of the better ones to come out of that genre.	4.0	A grand vision that flounders at points	2000-09-23	9	8	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A18BV4O63DOWNH	"""juno2"""	*Gladiator*  is the story of Maximus  (awesome name, eh?), Rome's best general and heir to Marcus Aurelius'  throne, and his subsequent downfall thanks to the Emperor's sniveling, scheming son Commodus  (an even more awesome name, based on an actual guy!) . . . AND his subsequent escape from slavery via the gladiator trade.The film attempts, I think, to be a  &quot;throwback&quot;  to all those tunic 'n' toga epics of the 1950's, but with a modern sensibility.  The first question I pose is:  do we really need an update of those terrible films?  Here's my second question:  in a movie purporting to be about the horrors of the Roman sports arenas, why do we see so little of that horror?  The storytellers seem to want to say something about violent entertainment and the corrosive effect it may have on people, but the violence is obliquely presented and the  &quot;people&quot;  the violence is supposedly coarsening are never seen  (except as CGI stand-ins).  Comparisons to  *Saving Private Ryan*  are bogus -- say what you want about the other film, there the gore was made explicit.  Director Ridley Scott, mindful of avoiding an NC-17 rating, chooses to IMPLY violence.  He does this by simply NOT HOLDING THE CAMERA STILL.  The camera whizzes, jerks, suddenly slo-mo's, goes all grainy, occasionally reverts to black and white -- does anything and everything but actually record what we're supposed to be seeing.  During the opening battle scene and the later fight scenes, I felt no sense of  &quot;being there&quot;, or really witnessing anything . . . except the excesses of the latest motion picture industry's camera technologies.  Also, the LSD-inspired  &quot;dream sequences&quot;  were over-the-top, to say the least, and some of the worst-filmed stuff I've seen all year.Finally, the story had zero suspense:  you know what's coming every step of the way, and you know how it will all end -- with Maximus facing the nasty Commodus in the Colosseum.  Considering what an interesting lunatic the REAL Commodus was in history, the screenwriters'  pedestrian effort here puzzles me.  Oh well. . . .	1.0	A mess.	2000-10-17	16	6	10

Maximus is a man of absolute principle and values so deeply engraved he will clearly die for them.  But is that the wise man?  They say ""Only the good die young"" and ""You either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain"".

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2ELMS3SL74YOU	"Justin Lev ""Wind-up Toy"""	I'm sorry, but I need to take this movie down a peg or two.  I liked it well enough when I saw it in the theater, but I immediately began to grow a distaste for this movie when I came to school on Monday and suddenly everyone is messing themselves over what a great film _Gladiator_ was.&quot;It was, like, better than Braveheart!&quot; &quot;Dude, that was the best movie I've seen in years!&quot; &quot;Russel Crowe's gonna win Best Actor!  And that Commodus guy was great!&quot;These were a few of the many comments that triggered a boiling resentment deep within the bowels of my intestines for this film which I still carry with me today.  It will now be like that permanently, thanks to the Academy's ridiculous presumption that this was the best film of the year.  First of all, the winner of the Oscar should have been either _Traffic_(which, thankfully, Steven Soderberg got Best Director for) or _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_(which, thankfully, won for Best Foreign Film).  Both of these films were twice as well-acted, twice as well-written, and ten times more satisfying to look at.  Gladiator, all gore aside, is one of the most grainy and ugly films I've seen in years.  The actors seem to be walking through an endless haze, which is easy to ignore during the battles, but annoying when a conversation is happening.As for Joaquin Phoenix, his character of Commudus is cartoonishly and inexplicably evil.  Ebert &amp; Roeper used a word I particularly agree with: &quot;transparent&quot;.  He is transparently evil and insane and not enjoyable to watch.  And Crowe does an acting job that Schwartzenegger could have pulled off, but for some reason won an Oscar for it.  It could have gone more deservedly so to more eccentricly difficult roles such as Ed Harris in _Pollack_ or even Tom Hanks' half-silent yet emotionally accurate part in _CastAway_.Was it a BAD movie?  Not really.  Was it the BEST movie of the year?  Definitely not.	2.0	Give me a break!	2001-08-02	17	6	11

Gladiators fighting against chariots is one of the best combat scenes ever made and make you understand why it took so long to outlaw gladiator fights in Rome. Almost makes you want to be there and watch it live!opening battle with Germans is done impressively, but super inaccurate:Romans won their wars not with cavalry charges but with marches of superbly disciplined, trained and equipped infantry.Cavalry at that time was used only to chase and finish off routed enemy.They did not even have stirrups yet, which made horseman effective on the battle field few centuries later. during the period when Gladiator takes place cavalry could not and would not make a &quot;decisive charge&quot;.and finally, in that battle German tribesmen were MUCH more likely to have mounted troops than Romans, which they don't.	5.0	great dvd - not too accurate opening battle scene	2003-08-26	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1N8B6LMO5ZB8M	Kamal Alyousef	"I was disappointed by the sound quality. I knew something would be wrong the moment I saw that the theatrical and extended versions shared the same disc. On top of that, there is a French track (Il est l&agrave; pour quelle raison? Je ne sais pas), the commentary (good to have) and the trivia track (nice to have). Disc 1 suffered from having all that material crammed into it. The audio quality is worse than the Dolby track of the original Signature DVD. But if you've heard the DTS track on the original you just could not sit through this one. Once you go DTS you can't go back! Why didn't the producers of the extended edition simply put each version of Gladiator on a separate DVD? A 3-disc box could easily have been a 4-disc box without much extra expense. They could have done away with the French track to increase the bit rate. Heck, they could've done away with the theatrical version altogether! Near the end of the trivia track they suggest that the fans keep both DVD editions together as one 5-disc super edition. Then what is the point of having two theatrical versions in that collection? Although I'm disappointed I still have to say that the documentaries on disc 2 are very good. I have a suggestion: I think anyone who buys this edition is entitled to a free empty box and sleeves to put the 5 discs of both editions in it. They can call it ""Gladiator: Consolation Edition"". Now, about that 10th anniversary high definition edition..."	3.0	Poor Sound Quality	2005-10-22	10	6	4
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AARAKC9SC2HEC	Karen F	"Amazingly, interestingly, and surprisingly, the movie Gladiator received 5 Academy Awards because of its rich quality and Russell Crowe's perfect, pleasing, polished, prized performance. The movie Gladiator is a Ridley Scott film which is a Dreamworks and Universal production, and stars Russell Crowe as Maximus:  the general who became a slave, who became a gladiator.  Although Gladiator is rated R for intense, graphic combat, it is an excellent movie lasting a highly refreshing two hours and thirty-five minutes, and is a movie that most teenagers are permitted to watch along with their parents.The movie Gladiator is about the Roman army's general by the name of Maximus who becomes a slave, and then is made a gladiator.  When Rome's Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, begins to grow old and weak, he decides to crown Maximus as Emperor before he dies, because he had realized that his only son, Commodus, was unfit to become the next Emperor of Rome.  Unfortunatly, Commodus was informed of his father's astute decision.  Commodus brutally murdered his father.  He became Rome's Emperor.  Maximus fled for his life.  Tragically, Commodus tried to have Maximus secretly slaughtered by his men in the wilderness.  Escaping the Emperor and his men's wrath, Maximus hurries to his home to try and save his family before they can be killed.  Across the rural terrain, Maximus rides his horse, treads the path on foot, and rests on the rocky ground until he reaches the outskirts of Rome.Maximus faced his worst nightmare.  Arriving at his home out in the wilderness, Maximus finds that he came too late, since the Emperor's men showed up before he did and they killed his wife and son, who were not warned of their fate.  Hopelessly, Maximus trudged away from his beloved home and the life he used to have because there was nothing left for him there.  While Maximus buried his beloved family near his homestead, he was slowly lossing his strength and losing the will to live.  Along the edge of the road, he plodded on until he collapsed on the ground, unconscious.  He laid there, motionless.  Maximus was soon spotted by an ignominous slave caravan, was captured by the slave caravan, and was displayed for sale as a slave when he awoke.  After a man came along seeking to purchase some slaves to become gladiators, Maximus was immediately and wisely chosen as one of the men.  Maximus' life becomes a nightmare.Since Maximus had plenty of experience in battle, because he was an army general, he fought surprisingly well in the arena.  Defeating every opponent in the arena as easily as if he were swatting a fly, Maximus was prolific as a gladiator, and so he gained a wide reputation.  Because of Maximus' great reputation, Commodus, (who is) now Emperor of Rome, not knowing that the great well-known gladiator is Maximus, decides one day to watch him fight.  Angrily, Emperor Commodus realizes that Maximus had evaded the wrath of his men, that Maximus had survived all these years, and that Maximus was standing in front of him at that moment as the idolized and famous warrior himself.  Commodus plots an evil scheme.  Maximus is challenged to fight the Emperor for his freedom, and when they fight, the outcome is utterly shocking.After reviewing the movie Gladiator, Jonathan Foreman of the New York Post stated, ""Russell Crowe is simply magnificent!""  Personally, I love the movie!  Viewing, reviewing, and critiquing Gladiator, Andrew Johnston, who works for US Weekly, rates the movie as ""****"" because he, too, thinks that Gladiator is a wonderful movie."	5.0	A Gladiator Review	2007-05-16	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2W8E91R4R9NF5	"Karina A. Suarez ""Karina A. Fogliani-Ahmed"""	This is probably one of the best movies I have seen lately. After seeing it, it lets you wondering, full of wishful thinking and wanting for more. Although &quot;Gladiator&quot; is a movie where no expenditure was cut short, the true heart of it is the way it projects the timeless values of the betrayed, incredibly charismatic hero who fights until the end to avenge the death of his loved ones, with a past, unforgotten love lurking around all the time. We get a taste of life in Ancient Rome as well, with its vices and abuses and, above all, its &quot;grandeur&quot;. The animations of Rome are so accurate, one almost regrets having missed it for 1800 years. Russell Crowe in the role of Maximus gives an award winning performance for which he will be remembered forever as the &quot;actor of Gladiator&quot;. He gets deep into the emotions of Maximus, his character, showing us not only his bravery but also - and this is very important - his vulnerability. Moreover he has the gift of a fantastic, deep voice, which adds to the drama of the story and wraps it up spectacularly with a soundtrack that is both glorious at times as well as morose.The scenes are shot with great care and realism. The one with the tigers is fantastic; but I find the one where Maximus' rage has no limits and kills everyone in the arena by himself the most intense.After Russell Crowe's marvel of a performance I second Oliver Reed's and Richard Harris'. Both masters of their task, they also give award winning performances; Reed as the wise ex-gladiator who helps Maximus with his tactics; and Harris as the last Great Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Sadly, Oliver Reed passed away close to the end of the movie and the last scene in which he appears is an animation of his character.I commend everyone in this film, especially the director, Ridley Scott, for giving us the opportunity to enjoy an epic of timeless values in our modern world, so much devoid of them.	5.0	Timeless values shine through in a modern epic	2000-12-28	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3BV9E9XSA4Z73	Karl	This is, without doubt, one of the worst films I've seen in a loooooooooooong time.  A sad reminder that even the best directors can have an off-day - and another, and another, and ...The action opens with a battle scene, filmed in the woods near Farnham in Surrey, England, which is so wrapped in gloom and haze that it tells us precisely nothing other than that the Romans had a more advanced armoury than their Germanic foe.Anyway, lots of noise and fire - looks like a good old-fashioned epic, right?Wrong!To cut a long story short, there's a really hunky good guy - whose main problem is that he can't speak clearly, so most of the time we don't know what on earth he's talking about.  But I suspect this doesn't really matter, because even when he does stop mumbling he never says much of any interest anyway.Then there's a bad guy, and he's a patricidal creep of the first water who, amongst other things, has the good guy's family killed - so you can't wait for him to get what's coming to him.  Only you do have to wait - for ages, and ages.Oh yes, there's also a heroine - but this is a real &quot;mano a mano&quot;-type film, so she never gets to be anything more than incidental set dressing.Now, you're never going to guess how it all turns out.The good guy kills the bad guy.  But the good guy dies as well, so he can rejoin his family in the great bye and bye.  Then the film ends.Bet that surprised you, didn't it!Actually there is one highlight in the film - Oliver Reed, proving what a very talented actor he was when in the right mood.Even so, that Ridley Scott felt it worthwhile to drag this pretentious drivel out to nearly two and a half hours simply beggars belief.Tip 1: Always be wary of a film where the scriptwriter is also one of the producers.Tip 2: If this film is so great, how come people are queueing up to sell their copy?	1.0	Pretentious drivel	2001-06-17	12	2	10

Add to this some exciting and slightly gory swordplay and an amazing, award-winning soundtrack that flows perfectly through the movie, and you have a wonderful escapist experience. (One of my friends tells me that she didn't like the gore, but got through it by shutting her eyes until the music told her that the gross bit was over.)The extra scenes on the second DVD add a great deal to the viewing experience, too.

Think of this movie as alternate history, the way things should have been, so to speak.  Anyone familiar with Marcus Aurelius the philosopher will recognize that Maximus was the embodiment of his ideal man:  at one with the universe, standing up to any adversity, accepting of all humanity, yet willing to fight for what is good and noble in the world, while recognizing how wretched the world can be.  If Marcus Aurelius could have created his heir, he would have created Maximus. Commodus was, historically, a wretched, depraved man.  While the facts about Commodus were incorrect in Gladiator, his character was aptly portrayed.  The story in this great movie - and I do think it is a great movie - could have been written by Marcus Aurelius himself: the way things s'posed to be.

Scientists and historians alike have dedicated themselves wholly to the project of determining where we came from, and how we got to where we are now.  The empire of Rome helped build foundations both in the social and economic fronts that remain prevalent even today.  Further, all ancient civilizations which endured powerful, lenghty reigns-- the Incans, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans.  The era has fascinated me so much that I have choosen to dedicate a substantial amount of my time to the study of classics, and the Roman language, Latin.For me the film was a wonder.  The special effects are incredibly well-done, if not a bit too gory.  Partially inaccurate, yes; unbelievable, naturally... it's Hollywood.  But to me the key that makes a movie great is its ability to suck you in.  Can you imagine yourself right there in the action?  While your watching do you feel as if you are some silent character, standing beside Russell Crowe, swinging your sword along with his?

What this means is that considerable edge enhancement (EE), or false sharpness, remains in place.  Universal, in prepping the old, outdated transfer for release, smeared what is called ""digital noise reduction,"" or DNR, all over the picture, to remove both the natural film grain that provides facial detail and other wonderful Blu-ray things, as well as cover up the nasty results of EE, which include white halos around most edges.The result?  A terrible picture:1. The detail that justifies a Blu-ray upgrade, namely clear backgrounds and great facial detail, is GONE.  It does NOT look like film, and barely upgrades the detail on the DVD.  Yes, it's slightly better, but only because of the increased resolution.  It's a barely noticeable upgrade.2. Some elements are actually missing!  Like arrows and catapult ammunition.  Gone.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2O3HUMA1EAIV9	Keith Fraser	Gladiator, like Braveheart, is about 90% untrue. The Senate wasn't democratically elected (I just discovered this from another review!), it never gained power from the emperors again, Maximus probably never existed in any form, 'thumbs up' meant death, etc.However, for some undefinable reason, unlike Braveheart I was able to set such considerations aside and just enjoy the spectacle. The incredible battle scenes, music that blends really well with the action, Turneresque vistas of Rome, great costuming (it's probably all wrong as well but I for one don't really care).I'm not qualified to give judgement on the performances, but I thought Russel Crowe as Maximus was pretty good. Joaquim Phoenix as the incestuous, patricidal, spoiled-brat Emperor is just fun to watch and quite chilling in his callousness. His use of the Colosseum to keep the people happy has echoes of modern-day propaganda.Definitely up there in my Top 10 films.	5.0	Historical nonsense but awesome nonetheless!	2001-01-23	1	1	0

Despite the customary Hollywood-hype surrounding the effects and bloody battle sequences, this film is simply about the most upstanding hero I have seen upon the silver screen.  While Russell Crowe's Maximus exudes an air of invincibilty, he raptures the audience with his vulnerability.  Yes, the mighty Maximus is a conquering general, a cunning warrior and a ruthless gladiator, however - at the core of this film - is a man who simply adores his family and home.  And that's where you will make a connection (and I am not yet married nor do I have any children!!!).  Everything else is mere scenery, i.e., the effects, the gore, etc.  You see a man who loves and is loved and manages to do all in the most dire of circumstances. In the spirit of Maximus, do yourself a favor and see the meaning of &quot;strength and honor&quot;.  Purchase this masterpiece and I can wish nothing more than for you to enjoy it as I have.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1PTPHMTNU00RU	Ken	Too often Hollywood presents charachters that we don't get to understand and if we do we wish that we didn't. While the last Gladiator spectacle (Spartacus)was released some forty years ago both movies share development of charachters that interest us and make us want to know more.Most of the roles in Gladiator are interesting and in every case we want to know more about these people. The Director allows us to learn the good and bad of people. It is easy to like Crowe's charachter as he stands for most of what we would like to think is right with people: noble, honest, loyal, etc.The characterization of Phoenix in the Commodus role is powerful as while he is clearly not a good person we can feel his pain and his need to be accepted by both his Father and his People. That he turns to such violence when he does not receive that love and approval makes and the manner of the performance by Phoenix all the more special. It is always easy to hate a &quot;bad guy&quot; but the depth of the emotions generated by him makes us pity him as we might a wounded animal.A superb movie at all levels which really breaks new ground in the epic genre. A special salute to Hans Zimmer for one of the most exciting and thought provoking musical scores in years. Also to Oliver Reed in his final role. This movie is destined to become a classic and should do quite well at the Golden Globes and Oscars in 2001.	5.0	Gladiator - A Study in Personalities	2000-12-27	3	3	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1LNM9GLK8CQOC	"Kenneth Wolman ""Ken Wolman"""	"I just received the three-disk DVD--two versions of the film plus two disks of supplemental material. I'm not sure the supplemental disks are necessary. But the extended edition of the film itself fleshes out a few things left unexplained in the original theatrical release, which I saw in 2000. The chief difference, for me, is why Quintus (Tomas Arana) orders his Praetorians to sheathe their swords during the climactic fight between Maximus and Commodus. The Emperor had ordered him to execute two of his men for concealing the fact that Maximus escaped the forest execution. Though Quintus defends his men and his own actions, it is clear that Commodus is not buying it; and I suspect that Quintus, who was in fact Maximus' friend and immediate subordinate in Germania, was complicit in facilitating Naximus' escape. The final sequence represents a kind of payback to the Emperor for what he made Quintus do, i.e., execute his own men. He will let the fight proceed even if it means the death of Commodus.For the film itself, Gladiator never loses its power. It is a dark and brooding saga that never quite made sense to me as a revenge tragedy until Ridley Scott explained it as a journey of a man who wants to go home, rather like Odysseus. Maximus has lost through murder his wife, his son, and his place in Roman society. He seeks vengeance--almost suicide by duel--to take him to the Afterlife where he can be reunited with the only two people he loves in this world. When Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) whispers to him ""You're home"" she understand the nature of Maximus' epic journey to rejoin his family.One of the interesting supplements deals with May 1999, when Oliver Reed died unexpectedly, and how the filmmakers dealt with the gaps he left. In a word, brilliantly. Reed's performance was great, and sustained the dark nature of the film. Crowe reputedly is both a consummate professional and grating pain in the butt. So, for that matter, was Phoenix as Commodus, who showed us the wounded nature of the man who could take his own father's life from shame and emotional desertion, and then turn to incestuous love for his sister.The battlefield scene in the first part of the movie defines the universe as cruel and merciless. That vision prepares us for the arenas at Zucchubar and Rome itself. Win or die: there are no middle grounds."	4.0	Almost suspended in time	2012-09-07	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1TO1P3NV7OAU6	"KevinB ""The Honey Badger"""	At the height of the Roman Empire Caesar is murdered by his jealous son. The General who was intended to succeed him is left for dead. Rome is now under the rule of a maniac. The former General is sold into slavery and is forced to become a Gladiator. He works his way to the coliseum and is soon the center of attention. He will use his power and fame to avenge the death of his murdered family. He will get his chance. He challenges Caesar himself to a duel and the outcome is legendary.This is probably one of the most famous movies in American cinematic history. It's got tons of action and plenty of drama. The acting and screenplay are both magnificent. This film is breathtaking in all aspects. I can't imagine there being a person out there who hasn't seen Gladiator. If by chance there is, that person needs to buy and watch this movie as soon as possible. It is an unforgettable experience.	5.0	A Colossal Action Film	2012-11-12	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A37CJ1UP5QJ85H	Kevin F. Kiley	This movie is nothing short of magnificent.  It captures both 'the glory that was Rome' as well as the relationship between a fighting commander and his troops, both used to hardship and victory, and attempting to finish the job and go home.This is also undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen.  It is reminiscent of the spectacles of the late 50s and early 60s, such as Ben Hur, El Cid, and 55 Days at Peking, but much more intense and certainly more realistic.The characters are greater than life, such as Maximus (Russell Crowe), the Roman general who was like a son to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (masterfully played by veteran Irish actor Richard Harris, whose facial expressions tell more than his diaglogue), and who was betrayed by Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Marcus' feckless son, who 'was not a moral man.'Director Ridley Scott has captured many things in this film: the timeless relationship between veteran soldiers and their commanders, Rome in its last spurt of greatness, evil and corruption of the Roman upper classes, the seeming hopelessness of good being overcome by evil, innocence of the young, and the recurring theme that evil will fluorish if good men do nothing.Lavishly filmed, and with better special effects than either Titanic or last year's Star Wars Episode One, it shows the Rome that may have been, with all the dirt, grit, and corruption that never showed up in the other epic films about Rome and its Empire.Music is also superb, and undoubtedly brings out the violent action of the film, from rousing fighting in the Coliseum to savage combat on the Danube frontier between the indomitable Legions and the German barbarians.Lastly, this was Oliver Reed's last film.  Remembered for his portrayal of the one of the Three Musketeers in the mid-70s and in the film Oliver, he is superb here, dying of a heart attack while the movie was being filmed.  The final product is a tribute both to him and his ability in front of the camera.This is a film for the ages.  It covers valor, cowardice, loyalty, love, hate, betrayal, and brings it in a story that is enthralling, exciting, and relevant to modern times.  The Director and cast, and the rest that contributed are to be congratulated.  If Scott, Crowe, the movie itself, cinematography and music are not awarded with Oscars by the Academy this year, it will be a great injustice.  I saw it five times on the big screen and enjoyed it every time.  Quite simply, it is superb.	5.0	'Unleash Hell'	2000-11-10	11	7	4
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ABEMGUFAIF7XP	"Kevin Kotowski ""kevinkotowski"""	Gladiator is a story about the journey of a man as well as a light review on the workings of Rome. I watch it over and over, and even my most &quot;action movie&quot; fearing friends love it. The power of Russell Crowes character is moving even in its 15th viewing. An unbelievable circumstance is made highly believable primarily because of his performance.I took the opportunity to rent a similar story, Spartacus, recently. I expected that the thing that would make me like Gladiator more would be the special effects and exciting battle sequences. However, it turned out that the sheer believability of Crowe's Maximus just made Kirk Douglas' Spartacus pale miserably in comparison.	5.0	This action movie is deeper than it appears	2002-01-05	1	1	0

I was truly impressed to see such a movie come out of Hollywood.  The casting was excellant and I was truly impressed that they choose a woman for the ""romantic"" lead that though truly hot actually looked the age of the character.  This is proof that you don't have to hire 20 year olds to play 30 year old characters to have a good movie.  Russel Crowe's acting in this was excellant.  He really made it seem like he was Maximus, not just an actor playing a part.What also impressed me was that though there were some moments of sexuality, they didn't feel the need to throw in unnecessary nude and/or sex scenes.  Proof that you can have a mature movie without being trashy.This movie was a great exploration of the contrast between a real man (Maximus) and a poser (Commitus).  Throughout the whole we see the contrast between the one who had been given everything but earned nothing and the man who started with nothing but good character and through it overcame in the end.I just wish I had another arm to be able to give it more than two thumbs up."	5.0	Where do I sign up to be a gladiator	2004-09-09	2	2	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3F4M4SQDCJCU7	"Kevin P. Attwood ""Kevin Attwood"""	"This Blu-Ray is the topic of much discussion across the HD world and the Internet.Reputable sites like The Digital Bits who have seen the disc report :""The problem is with the level of detail. The vast majority of the film has a slightly digital-looking quality to it, and there's clear edge-enhancement ""haloing"" visible. The extended edition scenes, however, look fine - no halos, no digital patina - they're very natural looking. If the whole film looked like the extended scenes, we wouldn't be having this conversation. What it looks like to me (though it's impossible to be sure, obviously), is that someone at Universal (keep in mind, it's Universal that controls the assets for DreamWorks - not Paramount), decided to re-use the original digital master of the HD transfer done back in 2000 for the very first DVD release.Now, that transfer was state of the art for its day, and it was approved by director Ridley Scott, but obviously it's a far cry from the quality of new HD transfers done today, in 2009. One of the biggest problems is that until fairly recently, video mastering engineers were still applying edge-enhancement to their digital masters knowing that they were going to be used ultimately for standard-definition DVD release, and also analogue VHS and laserdisc. It took the mastering community a long time to break the habit.In this transfer, you can see it in the image. It's also clear that the 2000 digital master has been digitally-filtered to reduce the haloing and other artefacts - the signs of DNR are not hard to miss. That's in contrast to the extended edition scenes, which were transferred in HD in 2005 and so look much better. They're still not quite up to today's standards, but they look far superior to the rest of the film and there's no edge-enhancement or obvious filtering visible. The footage simply looks natural - as it should.There's been some talk of DNR being so excessive that - for example - arrows and fireballs disappear from one frame to the next. This IS an issue, but the fact is that when you watch the image in full motion it's not something you really notice. The arrow or fireball is highly visible in one frame, less so in the next, more so in the third, etc. You still detect the object in motion, so you don't go, ""Oh my god, that fireball just disappeared!"" The image just looks generally digital and lacking in fine detail.""So there,make up your own mind. I for one love this movie and have both the original and Special Edition on DVD and have just cancelled my Blu-Ray order with Amazon. I will not be forking out another 26 Bucks for a lesser quality Blu-Ray. Paramount need to fix this now!"	1.0	Be Warned!	2009-08-30	25	21	4

Joaquin Phoenix chews plenty of scenery (&quot;I am vexed.&quot;) but gives a twisted, juicy portrayal of Commodus, the ruler of Rome.The disc is a good value, with the commentary track by Ridley Scott and others being worth the price of admission.

My friend is a male model and studying acting, so I value his opinion. Actually, I value it more because he's a friend. I see this film won the Academy award. None of this convinces me this is a great movie. Well, great, of course by the judgement of consensus, and the experts, but it just didn't interest me that much. Perhaps I shared just a little too much of Crowe's nonchalant attitude. . . I just didn't care that much. Perhaps the subtlety is what I Should have liked. Perhaps that made it more personal and less about empire.It just wasn't that entertaining for me. I'm not glad I watched it - I'm not a better person now - lol.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1LENFX59AST9N	KIR	Gladiator seems to be Hollywood's revenge of the small, more literary and intellectual movies which have garnered praise over the years (Miramax, anyone).  It's a big-budget, no-holds-barred action thriller which delivers the action and the quality that makes it a much better production that alot of what has come out of the mill over the years.  This is a well-made and well-acted movie- history is turned upside down (the emperor does survive his sister's palace coup in reality) but then again what's new in these kinds of movies.  As far as the genre goes, Gladiator is a cut above the rest- and the cinematography is spectacular. The feel and the plot are vintage Roman epic but the visual production is unmistakeably modern-day.  Gladiator is alot of fun and is great entertainment, however, i'm still baffled as to why this got the Best Picture Oscar and Quills wasn't even among the nominees.  Also, Joaquin Phoenix did a much better job than Russell Crowe- who himself didn't act shabbily.	4.0	Hollywood Gets It Right (and History Wrong)	2001-08-21	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AGKPTMTR3UX1R	"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here"""	Russell Crowe does a splendid job in this big budget period epic, playing the Roman General Maximus. Maximus is tapped to be the next Emperor of Rome. Predictably, he is betrayed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar's blood-progeny (shades of DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS). The spineless Commodus is portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, who devours his role with relish. Commodus sells the general into slavery, after which Maximus ends up a gladiator in Rome.Crowe's performance is dynamic, even given that he growls his way through most of his dialogue. The action asequences are exciting, appropriately gory, and (as far as the Roman histories tell us) historically accurate. Rome was a culture where brawn outweighed brains in value, and social standards of behavior were tied to an Emperor's own idiosyncrasies. In GLADIATOR, the Thinking Man (represented by Marcus Aurelius) is displaced by the Mob, who crave nothing more than bread and circuses (represented by Commodus). Maximus, a warrior-poet straddles both eras.In terms of story, GLADIATOR inevitably samples much of Kirk Douglas' 1960 masterpiece SPARTACUS, the story of a slave-gladiator turned liberator. For those who have never seen SPARTACUS, GLADIATOR will be an original treat; for those who have, the older film is still a stronger draw, with better performances, more memorable characters, and far superior sets (no CGI cheats).Crowe acquits himself well, and in his desire for a Rome ruled by laws, Maximus is a not too far distant cousin to Spartacus, the spokesman for human dignity. Given my choice, I'd watch Kirk first and Crowe second, but I'd want to own them both.	5.0	It Isn't SPARTACUS, But...	2010-08-21	4	3	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A120V3RVSK1O1K	K. Ostrowski	"Someone I trust recommended this film to me, and someone I distrust said it was bad, so I decided to check it out, and was pleasantly surprised.Admittedly, the thought of ancient Rome brings back images of ferocious lions and burning corpses to a Christian like myself, but I enjoy a good historical fiction as much as the next guy, and this film is certainly that.A trustworthy, courageous roman general named Maximus is rewarded by Caesar for his latest successful campaign, with the promise that when he dies, Maximus must take his place, returning Rome back from the brink of corruption and totalitarian rule.  However, neither Maximus nor Commodus; the son of Caesar, are pleased to hear this.  Commodus assassinates Caesar before he can make his plans known, rising to become the emperor and betraying Maximus, killing his family and trying to have him executed.Maximus is soon captured by slave traders, who sell him as a gladiator.  His military experience and great strength and skill make him a natural in his new profession, but his heart still longs for one thing; the death of Commodus, and the fulfillment of Caesar's last wishes.  The rest of the movie is about the chances that Maximus gets to confront Commodus again, and his quest for revenge and the restoration of the glory of Rome.Though the story itself never really happened, it rang with something rarely seen in movies these days; the message that virtue matters much more than cunning or authority.  At every turn, Maximus is shown to be brave, determined, protective of his friends and faithful to the Caesar who once commanded him in battle, while his enemy Commodus is shown to have every form of vice; greed, selfishness, laziness, cowardice and sloth.The one black spot on this movie's record in this regard is that ultimately, it is still a story about revenge.  Oh, sure, they include a lot of stuff about ""fighting for the glory of Rome,"" and struggling for the good of the people, but in the end, you know the real reason why Maximus is fighting so hard is that he wants to avenge the deaths of his family.I say this is the only black spot because any traditional kind of story, like this one, is going to have conflict and bloodshed.  It's inevitable.  There's a reason why this film is rated R.  However, even this is not taken to the extreme it could have been.  Most of the time, Maximus is essentially forced to fight and kill, and in one noteworthy instance, he actually shows mercy in a fight against a strong opponent; a rare thing in the roman games.Ultimately, though, what I liked most about this film was the noble sacrifices made by the hero and his friends in the later parts of the film, and the movie's very clear message that there is an afterlife, and what you do in this life matters for that very reason.  It's a truth too often ignored; too infrequently discussed.  By no means would I consider this film perfect, but I definitely enjoyed it.  Just don't try showing it to the kids."	4.0	Virtue, Vice, Conflict, Revenge and the Afterlife	2012-08-10	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3NCFQ7EIVF3M0	Kramnik	I wasn't expecting much when I bought this DVD. I hadn't read any reviews or content lists. I just bought it for the 17 minutes of extra footage, but this release is so much more than just that!The extra footage in itself is fantastic. Some dialogue is repititive, but it draws out the story and make the intentions of the characters much clearer. Also while some of the footage was in the earlier DVD release's deleted scenes section, putting it into the movie gives it much more perspective than can be provided by watching single scenes by themselves. Overall, it's fantastic addition to the already stellar theatrical release.Disc 2 has a a mammoth 200 minute documentary that delves into just about every aspect of the production, answers questions and doesn't just offer a glossy TV view; you actually hear the personal opinions of the people involved without any censors. You hear about the writers' dissapointment with story changes, the producers talking about getting Ridley, their reactions to the death of Oliver Reed, etc.Disc 3 features some additional deleted scenes, storyboards, massive production photo albums and other nifty things that a viewer can sift through.To sum up: Just the extra scenes more than make up for the money spent on this set, however Ridley doesn't stop there. The rest of the additional content is absolutely stunning and makes this a must-buy for all fans of the movie.	5.0	***** For the Extended Edition - Bravo!	2005-12-25	10	9	1

There is a poetry in that screenplay that just sings and elevates.  However, Maximus offers a worthy successor in the arena and even wins the love of a dying emperor as well as his daughter.  The son, however, is another matter--at first Joaquin Phoenix looks completely foppish and in no way the equal of Maximus--until he starts scheming.  His jealousy over the love of his father adds a dimension to what could have been a thoroughly despicable characterization.Maximus fights for his freeedom, he fights for vengeance, he fights for the honor of his executed family.  Human nature hasn't changed since ancient Rome.  Certain values are timeless, and that is why this movie speaks to us."	5.0	Outstanding hero, a slave more powerful than the Emperor	2004-10-27	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1U7CDZ0TA5BO9	Kristopher Tong	A spectacular movie with wonderful extras on the disc, this is one for the collection.  Without recycling the same ideas already stated some 500 times before me, I'd like to add that what is wonderful about Joaquin Phoenix's performance in particular is that he doesn't simply make his character fall into the typical villain stereotypes, but rather provides his Commodus with a depth and resourcefulness that make him truly understandable.  Treacherous and menacing he may be, but the new Emperor is also wounded, emotionally, perhaps more deeply than any other character in the film.  His character might have been the focus of a movie which aimed at creating Shakespeareanesque tragedy rather than heroic epic.  The plot, of course, demands resolution in traditional style, but Phoenix does not allow the complexity of Commodus' character to be lost.  Bravo!	4.0	simple addendum	2001-01-06	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	After the critical and commercial dissapiontments of White Squall (1996) and Gi Jane (1996), Ridley Scott returns to form with Gladiator! Starring Russel Crowe, the film is centered around the famous Roman legionaire Maximus, who is betrayed by the emporer's son Commudus (Joaquin Pheonix) and is sold to become a competetor in the roman arena. Russel Crowe's commanding performance as Maximus is gritty and brilliant, and it's easy to see why Crowe won the best actor Oscar for the role.Scott's visioanry trademark seen in films like Alien and Blade Runner is excellent, with huge CG re-creations of ancient Rome. Working with such an enormous scale and with such a big palet to use, Scott's unique talent for vivid and brutal storytelling is to the fore.The collosal action set-pieces in the roman arena are breath-taking, and with top-notch stunt work and sharp visuals, the backgrounds, vistas and entire battlegrounds are done to masterful effect. Hans Zimmer's score for the film is a real romping, 'wake the neighbours up' soundtrack that is one of his best. The cinematography is astounding, with 'helicopter shots' over Rome, and the ear-splitting sound fits the film's brutal tone.The acting is really impressive, with legendary actors Richard Harris as Emperor Marcus Aurelius and the late Oliver Reed as Antonius Proximo, a slave dealer who trains Maximus. And Phenoix plays the part of the evil Commodus with relish. But this is Russel's movie, and his performance is brilliant, combining ferociousness with pathos.The DVD extra features are exceptional, with a feature commentary from Scott and the other film-makers, an extensive 'making of' documentary, deleted scenes with optional commentary from Scott, trailers, T.V spots, production notes, cast and filmmaker's notes and more fascinating production info. One of the best DVDs on the market, this is must-buy material from one of cinema's greatest directors.	5.0	Ridley Scott's masterpiece!	2002-05-21	3	2	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2Q7GAS16DI6XL	K. Thompson	This movie was a surprising disappointment. The acting was superb. Russell Crowe did a fabulous job portraying the main character, Maximus, and all the supporting actors were absolutely fabulous. The plot was somewhat captivating and easy to follow. However, it seemed to be on the same gore level as Braveheart (but, then again, what can you expect? Ancient Romans had a pretty sick sense of entertainment. I mean, who likes to watch people die gruesome deaths?). Though the actors and writers did an above average job, the directing could have been done better by a junior-high student. The camera was constantly switching positions, and except for a few longer speeches, mostly made by Maximus, the camera never stayed in the same position for more than five seconds. Secondly, throughout the movie, the director always goes to this overly-symbolic, confusing, unmentioned, unimportant scene with Maximus running his hand through a field (what is that supposed to signify?). Though this movie was fairly entertaining (mostly because of Russell Crowe), this is not an Oscar-calibar film.	3.0	Gladitsover!	2000-12-19	9	2	7

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A16X61RLY1YJL7	"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid"""	In all respects, &quot;Gladiator&quot; is the perfect movie that should and does appeal to both men and women.  For the men there is no shortage of blood, guts and gore, from the opening battle sequence between the Roman Northern Army and the barbaric Germans to the exceptional scenes in the gladiator's arena.  For the women, of course, there's Russell Crowe.  For all, this exceptional epic silver screen masterpiece brings to life the intriguing story, filled with deception, deceit and heroic valor, of a Roman General who was on the precipice of becoming the Roman Emperor who then, by a twist of fate, became a slave and slave who became a gladiator and a gladiator who defied the Emperor himself.Few movies, with the exception of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&trade;&quot; can truly compare with the epic nature of this film that tells its tale with such intrigue and a truly compelling plot that will keep the viewer on the edge of their seat from the opening sequence to the end credits.Russell Crowe deserves all of the praise and accolades he earned for this film.  He truly became Maximus for this film, in every aspect.  Joaquin Phoenix played the part of the mentally unstable Commodus to perfection and the ever beautiful Connie Nielsen as Lucilla performed brilliantly.  Richard Harris' brief but poignant appearance as Emperor Markus Aurelius serves quite poignantly in showing what a brilliant actor he was and his talents will be and are sorely missed in the film industry.Director Ridley Scott who has brought forth such huge films as &quot;Alien&trade;,&quot; &quot;Black Hawk Down&trade;&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&trade;,&quot; shows his talents as an exceptional director quite brilliantly in this film and he deserves every last accolade he earned for this stunning and memorable film.  The score for the film matches perfectly with every scene, lending brilliantly to the mood and atmosphere.The premise:Russell Crowe is Maximus; the Roman Northern General who as the film opens up is leading his army to the end of almost five years worth of campaigning against the barbaric Germans.  In a brilliant and exceptionally well choreographed epic battle scene, the Roman army defeats the Germans and the campaign is finally over.  Emperor Markus Aurelius is there to witness the final battle and he's more or less taken Maximus under his wing and thinks of him as his own son.As Emperor Markus Aurelius knows he's dying he also knows that his only heir to the thrown, Commodus, is not a &quot;moral&quot; man and he doesn't wish for his powers as Caesar to pass to him.  He asks Maximus to take the thrown but Maximus has to think about it for all he's thought of during this long campaign is to returning home to his wife and son to be a farmer.  When Emperor Markus Aurelius tells his son Commodus that he will not be emperor, Commodus murders his father in a psychotic display lacking any true emotion for his father and conveying a more despicable outrage that he wouldn't be Caesar.As Commodus' reward to Maximus for his many years of faithful allegiance to his father and to the Roman Empire, he asks Maximus but once to acknowledge him as Emperor and Maximus refuses; Commodus orders Maximus' wife and son murdered.  He then has Maximus led off by Praetorians to be executed.  As is Maximus' &quot;talent&quot; he is able to free himself from the Praetorians and begins the long journey home, only to find that his wife and son are dead.Here is where this compelling story takes its surprising turn after Maximus buries his wife and son, he collapses on their graves, exhausted and depleted by the wound given him from one of the Praetorians.  He is picked up by slave traders and taken to the Middle East where he is sold to Proximo, played brilliantly by Oliver Reed in his final role.  Proximo is a former gladiator who fought his way to freedom and now runs his own games.What follows from there is nothing short of one of the most brilliant and compelling epic stories to have ever been brought to the silver screen and DVD, in which Maximus, Roman General, becomes a slave and then a gladiator and ultimately the gladiator who challenged the Roman Emperor himself.I highly recommend this masterpiece to any and all fans of this genre and who love what movie making is all about because &quot;Gladiator&quot; is one the &quot;definitive&quot; films of all time.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:- Director's commentary from Ridley Scott- Deleted Scenes, complete with Director's commentary- Treasure Chest:  A unique montage of additional footage cut to the powerful score- Interview with award winning composer Hans Zimmer on scoring the film- 2 Extraordinary Behind the Scenes Featurettes- One of a Kind production diary by young actor Spencer Treat Clark (&quot;Lucius&quot;)- Special slide show featuring concept art and storyboards- Photo gallery from Behind the Scenes of the &quot;Gladiator&quot; set- Theatrical trailer and TV spots- In depth production notes and detailed cast and filmmaker biographies	5.0	Gladiator - A true silver screen masterpiece!	2003-10-05	8	6	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AJA4C7WISFA48	Lance Howard	[...] I think most people have seen this movie, but if not this has been called many times by many people the best hero movie of all-time. Ridley Scott (BLADE RUNNER, ALIEN) transports Hollywood to second-century Rome in this rousing historical epic that proudly harkens back to such films as BEN-HUR and SPARTACUS. Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a Roman general who leads the troops in conquering Germania for the empire. When an aging Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tells Maximus that he'd like him to rule Rome once he's gone, a classic confrontation ensues between the brave and charming soldier--who wants to return home to his wife, son, and farm--and the jealous and conniving Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the emperor's only son, who is thirsty for power. Bought as a slave by the profiteering Proximo (Oliver Reed, in his last role), Maximus must kill or be killed in the ring, battling to save not only himself but the future of the very empire that he loves and honors. The film features a terrific battle sequence (that recalls the beginning of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), huge crowd scenes of thousands of people, and even a little romance, albeit mostly taboo. The impeccably choreographed gladiator scenes are violent yet thrilling, flashing by like lightning. GLADIATOR is a glorious spectacle filled with heart and soul.	5.0	The Greatest	2004-10-29	4	4	0

I remember after watching it for the first time, I made my own sword from scrap wood & laid into some mailboxes and windshields.  Ancient Rome burned in my heart.  GLADIATOR charges the blood with electricity. The characters are so compelling, deep and human. The villain, played to perfection by Joaquin Phoenix, was pure brilliance.  Russell Crowe dips his hand into the gritty Earth and produces a hero of uncommon, brutal honesty.  The lions, the vicious cheers of a blood-thirsty crowd...I give this movie exactly ONE STAR.  The story, even for an epic, was compelling for a grand total of five minutes.  The plot blunders predictably along, creating little or no emotional momentum & absolutely no sense of adventure.  Kids in a sandbox could contrive a better story than this piece of garbage.  About an hour into this vacuum, I just wanted Russell Crowe to kill Commodus so I could get back to my life.Joaquin Phoenix ""vexed"" me with his paper thin performance as the twisted, impotent usurper.  Perhaps Phoenix can't be blamed for the job he turned in?  They gave him such a narrow, cardboard role to play - a weak foil to the driven, fertile, masculine Maximus.  There was no descent into madness; something vaguely human that would have at least given some dimension to this silly story.Ridley Scott created a beautiful film.  The cinematography was masterful - like a crazy European car commercial.  A wild, powerful sports car rolls into the coliseum, everyone stops their torturous acting & begins to feel the fine interiors, check under the hood, blare some music and then comment on the trunk space.  Maybe a quick ride to showcase the vehicle's performance?  A lion could sit on the hood and roar a little bit - an obvious appeal to the grunting desire to identify with virility and power that lurks in all of us.

Crowe stops, looks at him,his head cocked to one side with a slightly rye expression on his face quickly pulls out both swords and decapitated his victim to the roar of approval from the crowd. Incensed he throws one of the swords narrowly missing a high ranking member of the audience and screams at the populace in the amphitheatre "" Are you entertained""? Well yes, for all the wrong reasons. And for the same reasons why this genre was rightly discontinued about four decades ago it fails to engage outside of the fight scenes and cannot be taken seriously. Good fun though.

It is a heart wrenching tale of one man's struggle to survive against all odds with the only thing keeping him going is his hope for revenge against the one man that destroyed his life.  The historical accuracy of the movie is amazingly good in reference to how the Colosseum was composed and some of the methods of fighting.

Indeed, it was after the third or fourth time through that I realized movie wasn't really about arena combat at all - The bloodthirsty gladiatorial combat is simply the backdrop against which are played the two major themes: saving Rome in accordance with the wishes of the dead Emperor Marcus Aurelius as well as saving to from the despotic clutches of his biological son, Commodus; and the second theme that develops as the now slave Maximus wants disparately to join his murdered wife and son in the hereafter.Crowe (Maximus) and Phoenix (Commodus) are set against each other and you get wound into the battle between good and evil, honor and betrayal, loyalty to an ideal and Commodus' despotic avarice born of jealousy and huge insecurities.  Often overlooked in the critiques, but also very good is Connie Neilsen, the multi-lingual actress from Denmark who plays the part of Commodus' sister Lucilla.  Her apparently long-dormant and now reborn affections for Maximus sets off Commodus, who vainly pursues an incestuous tryst with her throughout much of the movie.Rebuffed at almost every turn and correctly fearing that Lucilla has plotted against him, Commodus eventually dares to enter the arena to fight Maximus...  A bit far fetched; however, according to the historians, the real Commodus would from time to time show his ""bravery"" by going down on the floor of the area to personally administer the final blow to an otherwise incapacitated gladiator - the real Commodus was apparently every bit the coward of the movie version.Great movie -  Crowe, Phoenix and Neilsen give wonderful performances in this larger than life epic.

The story centers around a general in the Roman legion who is enslaved and becomes a gladiator of reknown, called the Spaniard.The general, Maximus, esteemed by all the legionaires that he commands, is a favorite of the Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius. The Emporer has a son, Commodus, and a daughter, Lucilla. While Lucilla is clearly the worthier of the two to inherit her father's empire upon his death, she cannot by virtue of her gender. The Emperor knows his son to be unworthy to rule in his stead, as Commodus is totally devoid of character and craven. So, Marcus Aurelius, knowing that his health is failing, tells Maximus of his wish to declare him protector of Rome upon his death, in hopes of returning Rome to the people, as a Republic. Unfortunately, Marcus Aurelius makes the mistake of telling his son the same, thereby bringing about his death at the hands of Commodus.Commodus, now Emporer, extends the olive branch to Maximus who refuses, knowing that something unsavory has happened to Marcus Aurelius, for whom he had great affection. Rebuffed, Commodus has Maximus arrested with an order for his execution, as well as the ravaging of his lands and the slaughter of his wife and small son. Maximus escapes execution, but does not make it home in time to save his family. Captured by slave traders, he is sold and becomes a gladiator known as the Spaniard. This is all I will tell you about the plot. Watch the movie and see for yourself.Suffice to say that Russell Crowe gives a masterful and powerful perfomance as Maximus. Yet, I think Joaquin Phoenix gives an extraordinary performance as the the evil and sinister Commodus. His role is not a majestic, heroic one, but for that reason alone, his performance is, to my mind, the more compelling one, as it is stangely moving. If there are any Oscar recognized performances to be eked out of this film, he should certainly receive strong consideration for best supporting actor. As to the special effects, I was disappointed because, at times, the special effects were noticable; that is, you could occasionally tell when special effects were being employed. It does not necessarily detract from the film; it is just a little jarring to be aware of it.	4.0	TWO THUMBS UP FOR GLADIATOR...	2006-12-02	2	2	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3HITVG7H47ZHP	Leah Charlotte Gerchario	After experiencing this film for the first time I walked out of the theater with a huge lump in my throat. Such haunting glory, such subdued greatness....it was as if I had been in the Coliseum fighting along side Maximus (Crowe). One cannot begin to explain the pure genius of this motion picture. It brings you to emotianal, physical and pychological climax in less than the first thirty minutes only to bring you back again.  Crowe, Phoinex and Neilsen all act with Oscar worthy preformances. Neilsen with her absolute helplessness, Phoinex with his twisted, evil and ambitious potrayal of the emperor Commodus and Crowe with his heart wrenching character Maximus: Father, General, Gladiator, hero.  Not only are the actors stunningly beautiful, the visuals are likewise. If you have ever wanted to know what Rome would look like before Attila the Hun, before natural disaster, before collapes, this is your chance. &quot;Gladiator&quot; will take you from a quiet villa in ancient Spain to the over-crowded, energy-packed streets of the greatest empire on earth.  With visuals never before attempted and acting that of gods, what is left to stir your senses more? Music. &quot;Gladiator&quot; contains one of the most glorious soundtracks I have ever heard. Hans Zimmer amasses cellos, ancient mandolins and precussion instruments, latin vocalist and his already untouchable talent to create a spine-tingeling score worthy of any award. I especially loved the song played during credits, &quot;Now We Are Free&quot;. It truly gave me goosebumps.  I don't recomend that you buy this, I command it. &quot;Gladiator&quot; is for anyone who loves action, adventure, romance and characters so deep with emotion you cannot help but watch it again. I have seen this movie four times and every time I come out feeling as though I should not speak or else the soft fog of the moment will break. Buy it. You will love it.	5.0	Unmistakeable Beauty	2000-10-18	35	27	8

Other people tell you the copyright on the back bottom right of the box says 2010 DW Studios LLC instead of the original which says 2009, also not always true.It seems the only definitive way to tell if you have the new version is to look at the innermost rings on the underside of Disc One itself.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A393FS8PXA38CT	Lee G.	To be honest I was shocked and then disturbed when I read that the critically acclaimed Gladiator would be for sale on VHS for $111 dollars.  Don't get me wrong.  DVD is the newest trend in movie technology, and I support its amazingly low price for two very valuable discs.  However, most of us can't afford DVD, let alone the cost of a full-priced movie.  I paid full-price for Gladiator when it first was released because I was so impressed with the trailer.  I continued watching the movie, though, at the dollar theaters because seven times seven dollars would equal a smaller checking account.  Besides, one of Gladiator's themes is that everyone deserves fairness and dignity, whether slave or free, white or black, man or woman.  The enormous video price for this film insults this value, allowing the few to enjoy this film just in time for Christmas.  We can do better than this; Maximus died for a nobler cause than movie sales.  This is a film which needs to be enjoyed by everyone, on both VHS and DVD.	5.0	No VHS Sale of Gladiator Betrays Its Own Values	2000-11-21	0	0	0

Of coarse, the film is basically Russell Crowe-and he is magnificent. Some of the film's battle sequences (especially the first harrowing encounter with the gladiators inside of an arena) are stomach-churning, but they are increasingly operatic...and important in character revelation. A truly good movie, while not a five-star &quot;masterpiece,&quot; that should be recommended (and enjoyed) by everyone.	4.0	A rarity for the year 2000, and a welcome one.	2001-03-28	1	0	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A9TLCML8MF6RS	Les Novak	I've taken the time and gone through all the reviews of this film, and for the most part, their all great.  But some are by far measures taken to be different.  Now if you didn't like the film, than fine, that's your opinion.  We're all entitled to that.  But first know what your talking about before you verbally bash something unknown to the context of your mind.My review of the film is simply this:  an unmistaken masterpiece.  Why?  first off, the acting is worthy of the salaries paid, particularly Crowe, Pheniox, Richard Harris as Marcus Aurilius, and Connie Nielson as the troubled sister.  The emotion between young Commodus and Maximus is completely different, as their characters are DIFFERENT!  Hence, one will act different in given situations.Second, Ridley Scott's direction is spot on perfect, balancing the importance of storytelling with eye-popping spectacle.  Some people have forgotten that this is the man who brought us THELMA &amp; LOUISE, and is only capable of ALIEN or BLADE RUNNER.  This is not true.  His use of visuals to convey an emotion put him in a category with Hollywood's greatest.Third, John Mathieson's cinematography is near flawless for the effect intended.  Some reviews attack he and Scott of 'stealing' from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, because of the look of the battle scenes.  Well, when a new form of sneaker comes onto the market, is it now safe to say that everyone who buys it 'steals' from the last.  No.  This system is called an Image Shaker, and it was also used in ANY GIVEN SUNDAY.  And resetting the shutter speed on the camera has been used for years, just not to the great effect in PRIVATE RYAN.Lastly, the storytelling may not be accurate, but who the hell cares?  Really, does it bother you that much that someone has creatively changed the use of history?  History is what it is, it's not going anywhere.  Don't bash the historical accuracy of the film, if anything at all, bash the film itself.  Does the film work with what it uses?  Then let it be.  The script is tight, and taught, and chock full of emotion, never confusing the moment.Oliver Reed, a character actor from the 60's and 70's, who passed away while shooting, has done some of the best work of his career here.  Yet nary a person mentions this, only daunting a film that deserves it's praise.I could quote several catch phrases, but I'm not going to.  Take what you will from this, I personally loved the film, and will buy it on DVD.	5.0	&quot;What we do in life, echoes an eternity&quot;	2000-11-08	20	16	4
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3KB1H0S7T6JX1	L Gontzes	Definitely a great epic movie, Gladiator, brings to the screen the story of the Roman general Maximus, as he seeks revenge against the Roman emperor for the killing of his family and the injustices that have been done against him.The story starts with an AMAZING battle against the barbarians in Germania, in which the Roman legions are victorious.Maximus' quest takes us from Rome to North Africa and back all the while providing an extraordinary plot along with some great scenery.The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind, thus, resurrecting interest in historical adventures after a long dormant period.Needless to say, Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, especially Joaquin Phoenix's character who as Emperor Commodus, steals the show!The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!Arenas, Battles, and swordfights are all about.In short, it is a movie worth watching!	5.0	EXCELLENT!	2005-01-08	1	1	0

Fantastic, imaginative fight scenes which even got my adrenaline going, and I'm a nerd who wears bows on her shoes.  Crow was a stoic pillar of strength as a deposed general turned gladiator around whom Rome's disaffected republican  elements rally.

It is the kind of movie you don't expect it to be soossoso good, but when you finally are watching it you experience every emotion there is for you to experience in a movie(tension, sadness, happiness and fear). Although it does contain some bloody and intense scenes of war, it gives a message of life that is too special to miss it. How love can conquer all and remain in ones mind forever. Gladiator is a movie that, especially in my experience, the viewer feels like it's living the story. Russell Crowe does a fanstastic job in this movie and well deserves the Best Actor Oscar.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	The theme is familiar.  Good guy sold into slavery as gladiator in ancient Rome.  I was weaned on these movies as a child -- Ben Hur, Sparticus, Samson Delilah.  These epics still echo in my memories.  And I hold similar films to a very high standard.  Alas, though, the director of Gladiator is no Cecil B. DeMille or Stanley Kubuck.  The Gladiator doesn't even get on the playing field against those giants.That said, the Gladiator does have some good points.  Richard Harris as the dying Caesar is wonderful, and Oliver Reed as the gladiator slave dealer is great.  This last film of his is a great legacy to his talent as I understand he died during its filming.Russell Crowe, cast as the hero Maximus is all machismo and righteous anger. Undoubtedly this role will spark his career.  It might have been the weak script or it might have been his one-dimensional portrayal, but I just couldn't get into his character.  I wanted to care and I didn't, which is a shame because it is his performance which was supposed to carry the story.Joaquin Phoenix as the villain does a better job.  As the embodiment of evil, he is easy to hate.  The female lead, Connie Nielsen, while attractive, also played her role with a constant angry tone, which limited her appeal.The action scenes were done with the best of computer graphics.  There's blood and gore and heads being lopped off.  Some of the scenes are done well, such as when Maximus turns the gladiators into an army and they fight against several teams of chariot fighters.  Other scenes, such as the opening one where the Roman army is conquering an enemy, are so confused that I rarely knew who the participants were.Basically the film is 2-1/2 hours of action, with some long talky scenes in between.  Mostly, it held my interest.  But I couldn't help thinking of the good old days before computer graphics, when the epics were fueled with star power and great directing.  I'd like to see some real passion along with the violence. But perhaps I'm just getting too jaded.However, not all movies have to be all things to all people, and the Gladiator does succeed as pure entertainment.  There's good guys and bad guys and lots of battles.  There's a feeling of history and ancient Rome. And its a way to escape from our own personal stresses.  I can recommend it on that level.  And I'm personally glad I saw it myself.	3.0	I'd like to see some real passion along with the violence	2000-11-25	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AD2BIAIH78QI5	"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal"""	"Well, I don't THINK I saw the same movie everybody else did! ""Gladiator"" won all these Academy Awards and accolades, and my heavens, I really don't know why. I'll have to check what else was up for the Oscar for an insight into that decision.Russell Crowe stars as the victorious Roman general even Marcus Aurelius wants to succeed him as ruler of Rome. But Marcus A. makes the really stupid mistake of telling his biological son his plans in private, so guess what happens to him? Suffice it to say that the son quickly becomes the new emperor. The general survives a death plot only to find himself enslaved and sold to a gladiator trainer played by Oliver Reed.  When we hear that the new emperor is terribly fond of Coloseum games, we can put two and two together to figure out the rest of the plot.Bad Things?  The cutting was so confusing, I didn't know what was happening! Major problem. Another problem was the so-called acting of Russell Crowe. This is best actor? More like walk-thru acting to me. He was far better in ""A Beautiful Mind"".Best Thing? Joaquin Phoenix as the villainous young emperor. He really stands out in the picture. Seems to me he's been studying his Laurence Olivier tapes, especially ""Spartacus"" and ""Wuthering Heights"".The most obvious predecessor to this movie is Kirk Douglas' ""Spartacus"". There, a gladiator army takes on the legions of Rome with some success before their tragic downfall. Even has a gladiator school, though Peter Ustinov's is a more interesting place.  Other familiar scenes of gladiators who won't follow ""thumb"" in the arena, allowing their vanquished foes to live also derive from ""Spartacus"". I further contend that the makers of this movie were ripping off--now don't laugh at me--the Kevin Sorbo ""Hercules"" TV movies. Look at the one where Hercules has to journey to the underworld and his wife gets killed. You'll find it strangely reminiscent of a lot of this movie, especially the music and Elysium depictions of his wife in the afterlife. But frankly, ""Hercules"" is more entertaining than ""Gladiator"", and of course so is ""Spartacus"".So, after all the hoopla I'm really taken aback to see how unimpressed I was by ""Gladiator"". ""Gladiam"" that I saw it for free at a church social, rather than having had to shell out my own dough."	3.0	Quem vidistis, TutorPuella? or What did you see TutorGal?	2002-07-16	6	3	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3NYZB4V55CZIM	Liz	Gladiator is in my humble opinion, a near perfect movie. It works on so many levels - the acting is phenomenal, the story is compelling, the backdrop of the film is beautiful. It is destined to be a classic, and is a movie that can be watched and appreciated with each subseqent viewing.I know that many of the reviews have focused on whether or not the reviewer received the remastered edition. I cannot comment on that because it wasn't a primary selling point for me so I cannot in all honesty state if I received the remastered copy or not. Regardless, I am not disappointed with the picture and sound quality which I thought was excellent.There are plenty of special features to be had, including commentaries, storyboard designs, and deleted scenes. The bluray comes packaged in a dual disc bluray case. This was honestly the one source of contention for me. I personally felt that a movie this epic, deserved cooler packaging for it's remastered Sapphire Series release. Instead what I got was a cheap dual disc bluray case with no inserts or booklet. Other than that though this is reasonably priced and a great addition to any movie collection.	5.0	Reasonably priced and a great addition to any movie collection	2014-05-14	0	0	0

I don't think he deserved the oscar for this role, he should have got it for the insider but that is the way it goes.And I think by far the best performance was that of Joaquin Phoenix (Emperor Commodus), who not only looked like an overfeed ceasar, but convincinly played a madman obbsessed with winning the affection of both the populace and his sister and yet tormented by rage and jeleousy.  The final mockery is when his body is left unheeded in the colosseum while maximus is given an emperor's send off.	3.0	Not bad for an epic	2003-02-06	2	1	1

Gladiator is one of their premium catalogue titles and they've made a complete and utter mess of it. It appears they've used the old transfer from 2000 and run it through a grain scrubber (half-a-dozen times by the looks of it), thus eliminating all fine detail. Of course, it wouldn't be the first Blu-ray title to have excessive DNR applied, but scrubbed to the point it actually removes parts of the film? I believe that IS a first. Arrows and fireballs that magically disappear and then re-appear? I know the Romans were a rum bunch but I'm pretty sure they didn't have cloaking technology back in the day.Just as Sony did with The Fifth Element, Universal need to do a new high-definition transfer and issue a recall notice as a matter of urgency...and for those unlucky folks who've already coughed-up their hard earned, an exchange programme needs to be implemented at Universal's expense.As an aside, the Braveheart transfer is nothing short of stunning!	1.0	Waximus the Waxiator..	2009-09-01	34	29	5
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ADJXL0W0RJ7VV	Lord Chimp	Gladiator has somehow garnered adulation. It snagged the Oscar for Best Picture (no mean feat), made lots of money, and collected a reasonable share of critical acclaim. But even after watching it (twice), I steadfastly stick to my conclusion that Gladiator is not a great movie...not even a good one.Gladiator holds promise for a heroic story with a liberal dosing of medieval battles. In the end, I am left with a feeling that the film is a blatant retread of Braveheart and other more successful varieties of the &quot;hero fighting for freedom and revenge&quot; plot. Our hero, Maximus, spouts several turgid speeches that sound as if they were ripped directly from Braveheart, and his lack of emotional power render his recitations tepid and uninspiring. Maximus' forgettable dearth of emotionalized feeling when his family is mercilessly slaughtered is nauseating. Crowe's entire role is too halfhearted (he won Best Actor!?!?), helped little by the mimetic script. Don't even get me started on the implicit affection between Maximus and the emperor's sister, which was retch-inducingly contrived.The battle scenes are ambitious in their orchestration, but ultimately they are filmed poorly thanks to erratic camera movement that forsake clarity or the exhilarating involvement of, say, Saving Private Ryan. Admittedly, the chariot battle is stunning, with its breathless sense of urgency that the filmmakers captured here. But why didn't they do it for the rest of the movie? It doesn't help that the different battles seem like disparate events unforgivingly adhered to an existing story line to add violent physical conflict. What Maximus is fighting for becomes unclear amidst the series of battles, which lack fiery emotional intensity that SHOULD be present when someone is fighting for freedom and revenege. One area that deserves accolade is the incredible sound. All around, you can hear arrows whiz by, the cacophony of clashing steel, and anguished screams. Very impressive!And then comes the big kick in the face: the woeful anticlimax. I won't go into detail, but prepare to be disappointed. Suffice to say, Maximus becomes a martyr, but what did he accomplish? Bad, regurgitated speeches? Passionless action? Great work!Gladiator may have been a better movie if it had been thirty minutes shorter, cut out the sordid insinuations of romance, and had more chariot battles. But when you're making a big Hollywood blockbuster, you've gotta have reams of dross to guarantee it sells.	2.0	Well, the chariot battle was good...	2001-03-28	12	5	7

Like most people, I prefer instead to rent, and even then I read up beforehand, because I don't like supporting [bad stuff].Gladiator is a megaproduction that you have to watch a few times to really appreciate, with the exception of Ridley Scott's direction. Some criticise it as being too dark, the dialoge stilted and uneventful, or a very jaded representation of Rome, and they're right.As an epic, Gladiator falls far short due to it's narrow-scope and jumbled pace, making for a rough and confusing ride, which leads up to a somber, anti-climactic end that leaves you with the same pervading unease you had throughout the film. Suffice it to say, I didn't really enjoy watching Gladiator at first. Even grand-scale recreations get boring if there is no substance behind them. The performances from Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix drew me in at times.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3RCCH0GWOUMEE	"Louis M. Perez ""presicion25"""	This movie was good and it was very well made, but as another reviewer pointed out, it is not historicaly accurate. Commodus was actually made co emperor before Marcus Aurelius died and Commodus was only his last name. Not like it matters but his full name was Lucius Aurelius Commodus.Commodus was an ill conditioned youth when he took the throne at 19 and proved to be a latter day Nero. And like Nero he died an undignified death. A professional athlete was hired to strangle him to death in his bed in 192 AD because no Caeser would have ever fought like a Gladiator in the colisseum. Also Marcus Aurelius was only 59 when he died so he probably didnt have white hair and a beard.There's so many movies historically innaccurate it doesnt really bother me anyway. i thought id just let people know the true history.	4.0	Good but Not Accurate	2005-12-09	15	7	8

Whichever academic produced the research for this film should be shot for incompetence. When the Roman general, at the start of the conflict, shouted out 'Roma Victor' instead of the grammatically correct 'Roma Victrix', I knew I was in for a long haul. Whoever heard of anyone being called 'Proximo' ? And how did Maximus get from Germany to Spain so quickly ? The Occidental Express ? The actual gladiatorial scenes were well organised and thought out. It will not escape the viewer that the film is virtually a crib of 'The Fall of the Roman Empire'. For Russell Crowe supply Stephen Boyd, for Joaquin Phoenix supply Christopher Plummer, for Richard Harris supply Alec Guinness, for Connie Nielsen supply Sophia Loren. Add James Mason to this illustrious group and you have people who can act instead of people who 'go over the top'. Phoenix looked no more like Commodus than Jay Robinson like Caligula in 'Demetrius and the Gladiators (the movie, not the pop-group), both of them overacting. Of all the films involving gladiators, Spartacus is still the best. If people aren't convinced by Kirk Douglas, they will be less convinced by Russell Crowe who, whether he plays Maximus or John Nash, is still Russell Crowe.	3.0	Great entertainment of no educational value	2012-06-09	9	1	8

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A230OGCL6HYIKY	"Macjazz1 ""macjazz1"""	"I watched Gladiator on TV last night - what a piece of ... Oscars all around for this garbage? [I] always knew the Oscars were BS, but now I really know it for sure! Was Ridley Scott sleepwalking when he did this? I know he's inconsistent (see Bladerunner for one of his great films) but this verges on Paul McCartneyesque erosion of talent. This is from the same year ""Traffic"" was released - not a perfect film but surely more Oscar-worthy than this waste of celluloid (and waste of my time). I will grant that this type of ""epic drama"" is best suited for the big screen, not chopped up for television, but ... is ... whether it's 20 feet tall or the size of my TV.This movie is glaringly dumbed down - it relentlessly plays to the lowest common denominator, whether in its annoying and intrusive musical score (the placement and use of the music more than the music itself) or it's laughable ""faux Shakespearean"" dialogue ... what, the Romans spoke fake Elizabethan English? Bad fake Elizabethan English? I realize there's precedent for this type of speech in historical dramas, but it frequently doesn't work and it's certainly misplaced here. The special effects, scenery, etc. look good but, as with the recent Star Wars movies, the window dressing doesn't really matter...Forget Gladiator.Edit: I was looking through my profile today, and skimmed through some of my past reviews.  It needs to be said that this one was fairly heavily censored, making it appear to have been far more obscenity laced than it really was in its original version (for example a word meaning ""excrement"" beginning with C and ending with P was removed, among others of similar nature).More importantly, a lot of the content was removed, and several phrases substituted for my actual words.  For instance, I never wrote ""Forget Gladiator"" (Nor ""F.. Gladiator in any form). The review was more coherent and read a LOT better before it was bowdlerized.  Having said that, I'll still stand by the bit of it which did make it through.  The bad fake old English accents were particularly jarring in the film, in addition to the stilted performances.

Umm, seems to me just like your typical revenge type story strung together with the Gladiator battles to keep your attention along with some incest.Ah, the lovely scenery. Nope, just bland dark muddy colours here. They don't reflect the theme much either, even good events take place in front of hideous backdrops.Maybe, Russel Crowe's acting. Some of his lines are compelling, while others are bleak, empty and hollow.I nearly fell asleep between action scenes, which ultimately diminished into hand to hand battle. I didn't care how the movie ended, all I cared about was when. I yearned for another battle like the chariot one, but it never came. I yearned to see an umpredictable ending, but didn't.

GO to DVD town for more details.For those people who do not speak, write or understand Spanish, here is a full translation of the review above this one:A Caesar with something of common sense would not have an option: Gladiator deserves the sign of APPROVED, not with one, but with two thumbs up.With digital technology of last tip, the Roman epic of director Ridley Scott brings us of return the glory that was Rome.  Never lit up so densely affluent; so extravagantly decadent.On the verge of dying, the emperor Marcus Aurelius decides of naming as his successor to Maximus, general of his army, with the hope that he protect to Rome and he return the power to the town.  But its ambitious, determined son Commodus to comply not the will of his father will untie a chain of events that will change the future of the Roman Empire.  Maximus should survive to the jealous ire of , the murder of its family and the infamy to be a slave.  But it will be just like a gladiator that Maximus will find the way to serve again to Rome and to comply the done promise with the dead Marcus Aurelius.The epic movies returned to the large thing.  Reviving all the pomp and ceremony of the old civilizations, Gladiator will dazzle them with extraordinary battles, scenes of realistic fight and some admirable views of England, Malta, Italy and Morocco.Russell Crowe is a magnificent gladiator; a combination of brain, muscles and noble soul, that places him in the same rank of Kirk Douglas in Spartacus or Charlton Heston in Ben Hur.  His Maximum is a hero in all the extension of the word, virtuous, genuine, charismatic and very, very human.The remainder of the distribution is magnificent, since the selection of Joaquin Phoenix as the despicable Commodus, whose resentments and jealousy they are palpable, to Richard Harris in their small but stunning role of Marcus Aurelius.  Every actor is excellent: Oliver Reed (who passed away some days before culminating the filming), proud as the former gladiator Proximus, Connie Nielsen in the role of Lucilla, Djimon Hounsou like Juba and the veteran one Derek Jacobi, as the senator Gracchus.Under the right hand direction of Ridley Scott -who removes the best of the hyphen supported by a range of technological tools- Gladiator succeeds to find a perfect balance between action and emotion.  His main focus is in the personages and the flow of a history that captures the importance of our actions.  Its protagonists emit vitality, in the country of battle, in the bloody sand and above all, they convince us completely that is worth while to live or to die for the values and ideal that we carry inside.	4.0	New DVD is coming of Ridley Scott's 2nd best film	2005-05-20	2	2	0

Outstanding performances from all of the cast but surely the most watchable, by Russell Crowe, who fills his character to the the full (literally and figuratively).If you want to &quot;watch a film&quot; then this is the one.  The DVD version is fab value for money with oodles of extras, which are definately worth the leap from VHS to DVD (if you havent done so already, this is the film to persuade you to do so).This film has everything one is looking for in this this entertainment genre, action, suspense, intrigue, surprises, beautiful cinematography, character growth and phenomenal performances (Joaquin Phoenix is truely chilling as the mad egotistical evil emperor and was in my opinion robbed of the oscar for best supporting actor), and  an element almost synoymous with Russell Crowe now, sexual tension (yes its there if you were paying attention).If you buy nothing else this year get this.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3EKBQV42A48TX	Mark A. Jensen	"A Roman epic, a Loyal Roman's Odyssey, a movie that makes you cheer and cry for the good guy.A great and respected General, Maximus (Russell Crowe) helps Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the Roman Emperor, win another battle.  This battle was against the last enemy ""of the time"" to oppose Rome.  Marcus Aurelius, tired and old, is concerned for the future of Rome.  He decides that Rome's future would be better of it were run by a Senate instead of an Emperor.  He confides in Maximus and his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) that he is going to declare Maximus his successor to work with the Senate instead of making his heir apparent son, the Emperor.  Commodus kills his father before the announcement and, when Maximus will not pledge his allegiance to Commodus, has Maximus executed.  He also crucifies Maximus' wife and son, who Maximus loves dearly, but hasn't seen in almost three years.  Maximus narrowly survives the attempt on his life, but ends up a slave to an ex gladiator (Oliver Reed).  Commodus had admitted to his father that he is neither brave, respected, nor righteous, like Maximus, instead he exclaimed that he is ambitious, smart, and cunning. He knows his role as Emperor is tenuous at best, as many believe the senate should be the governing factor of Rome.  The gladiators are brought to Rome by Commodus as a ploy to entertain and thus gain allegiance of the people.  However Maximus the Gladiator ""known as the Spaniard"" gains the good will of all that watch the games.  Once Commodus finds out who the Spaniard really is, Maximus needs to be saved by his one time love Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) Commodus' sister, and a loyal Roman Senator.While the sound track will not be on the top ten hits list, it works well with the story line and helps build suspense and mood.  The grandeur and reality of the landscape, especially the coliseum (albeit noticeably digitized) is noteworthy.  The script makes the characters and plot believable.  The acting of Crowe and Phoenix make it come to life with the help of director Ridley Scott (Hannibal, G.I Jane, Alien, Thelma and Louise, Blade Runner and Someone to Watch Over Me, to name a few).  Crowe, after making numerous movies involving Australia where his acting, looks, masculinity and horsemanship where propelling him to bigger and better roles in more recent films, such as LA Confidential and last years film The Insider.  Crowe leaves his suit coat and whistle blowing scientist role in The Insider to go back to the rugged look, which he can obviously play.  Crowe shows us his macho side in this movie, much as he did in LA confidential where he played a police detective that takes on the mob and dirty cops.  In contrast to his macho side is his sincere love for his wife and son, once you see him light the candles and hold the little wooden figurines of his family to help get through the time away from home, you can sympathize with him when they are killed.While I am not a big fan of Phoenix, (The Yards, 8MM, Clay Pigeons, and To Die For) in this film he convinced me he was truly cruel and off of his rocker. Nielsen (Mission to Mars, Soldier, Devil's Advocate and Voyage) is beautiful, loyal, and convincingly sincere in her fear of her brother and in her love for Maximus.  Reed, who died during the production, stars in his final role after over two dozen movies since the early 1960s.  He played and looked the part of a retired Gladiator that shows the ""Spaniard"" how to win the crowd's favor.When this movie came out I couldn't decide if I wanted to see it, so I asked someone who had.  My secretary, I'll just say she is over 50 years of age, ""said I loved it!  Russell Crowe's eyes are to die for!  You and your wife will both like it.""  I like action movies but my wife does not; yet we both enjoyed the movie very much.  We felt the battles, scenery, and roles played by the actors were very realistic.  This movie is not unlike Braveheart and The Patriot, both of which have there bloody scenes but they are offset by intensity and captivating roles of the characters.  The Gladiator, rated ""R"" due to the fact that it also has graphic violence and bloodletting as the war between the Germanic tribes and the Romans comes to life.  Of course the battles that the gladiators have also let a head or two roll.  Don't let this bit of realism scare you off, much of the veracity is subdued by the grandeur and speed at which it happens.  Beyond the blood, the acting is good, the scenery and the coliseum are beautiful, but can't be appreciated on TV like on the big screen.  The politics involved with running Rome at the time is realistic, much like today where politicians play one group against another to get their way and/or where they want to be.  The plot is well thought out, and the story moves along making the two and a half-hour movie seem much shorter.  It gets five stars."	5.0	Gladiator; A Roman epic, a Loyal Roman&#65533;s Odyssey.	2001-03-27	7	4	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AKX28FGA6L47J	Mark	"Gladiator marks the return of those epic movies about the Roman Empire of the 50's and 60's i.e. Spartacus, Ben Hur that seemed bigger than life. It is a grand spectacle of a movie that contains amazing fight and electrifiying battle scenes (think about the opening 15 minutes of the movie..!!) as well as superlative performances from not only Russell Crowe, who richly deserved his Best Actor award, but from an assortment of wonderful British actors i.e. Richard Harris, David Hemming, Oliver Reed.Gladiator tells the story of Rome's most decorated soldier / general - Maximus. Maximus is loved by Richard Harris - Marcus Aurelius Caesar - who sees qualities in Maximus - strength, honour - that he does not see in his own son, Commodous (a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix).When Commodous hears that his father is dying and will not be bequeathing the title of Caesar to him, but instead handing over the management of Rome to his most trusted general, Commodous murders his father and decides to execute Maximus for treason - not recognizing the treacherous Commodous as the new Caesar. In addition, he also decides to have Maximus' wife and son crucified as well.Maximus escapes his executioners and escapes to his home, only to find his family murdered and his home burned to the ground. Shortly thereafter, he is found by Oliver Reed and banished to Reed's gladiator school.The rest of this epic movie follows Crowe's ascent to ""gladiator superstardom"" while thirsting for revenge against Commodus, the man who killed his family.Russell Crowe was made for this role. He commands much of the time on the screen and it's impossible to take your eyes off of him. Prior to his many fights in the colliseum, Crowe is like a focussed but caged animal just waiting to spring into life. It doesn't matter how much the odds are against him, Crowe is relentless in his desire to live to eventually get his revenge.He's a natural leader of other men and it's remarkable to see him exert his leadership skills over the other gladiators who have also been captured and enslaved into this life. Crowe quickly gains ""superstar"" stature amongst the Romans who flock to the Colliseum to see him and this creates a problem for the Emperor, who sees the threat that Crowe poses, but can no longer just have him killed for fear of offending the Roman citizenry.Like many of the great Hollywood historical epics, Gladiator is the story of the triumph of a heroic figure over seemingly-insurmountable odds. What sets this movie apart is that it manages to perfectly blend sweeping action scenes and great computer effects with a wonderful story and magnificent performances from both the leading and supporting cast.It never allows the special effects or grandeur of the scenery overshadow the basic storytelling of a slave / gladiator who is taking on the most powerful man in the world. Too many Hollywood films rely on the millions of dollars that they're able to throw at the digital and special effects and hope that this alone will salvage the movie (I disliked the Matrix movies immensely precisely for this reason.!)This movie essentially tells a story that may not be entirely original, but it is told in an honest and forthright manner and is believable. Maximus is a decent man who is committed to a singleness of purpose - whether it is destroying the germanic army in the opening scene. Or exacting his revenge on the cowardly emperour who murdered his family.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the efforts of the film's director, Ridley Scott. Best known for Blade Runner and Alien, Scott has managed to create an incredible canvas that conjures up the majesty that must have been ancient Rome. Between his vision - and Crowe's performance - they succeeded on a level that is not very often acheived.It's no surprise that this movie successfully managed to be both a commercial and artisitic success and will appeal to both men and women.Highly recommended."	5.0	An Epic Movie For The Ages..!!	2004-08-24	3	2	1

You would have had to major in Roman history to tell where it was going. I know this was not suppose to be a girly movie, but it could of had some drama to it. Plus their was no substance to it.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AST7UNIXVOAVA	Mark Shanks	As reluctant as many people may be to admit it, this movie wouldn't have been made if it weren't for &quot;Conan&quot;, not to mention Hollywood's earlier Roman extravaganzas &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, and the others. The problem is that all the testosterone has been drained away: in our enlightened age, it won't do to have a man beat and hack the life out of another guy without getting the opportunity to show us his softer side.As a &quot;revenge&quot; movie, it works on a pretty superficial level. There simply isn't enough background for the audience to identify all that deeply with Crowe's &quot;Maximus&quot; - his family dies off screen without us ever really seeing them, and frankly, I didn't think find him a sympathetic character anyway. The entire plot was contrived - I felt thoroughly manipulated: wind up Maximus and let him buzz through all those bad old gladiators on his way to his eventual (and totally inevitable, entirely predictable, and wholly inconsequental) fight with Commodus. Ho-hum. Top it all with a big Hollywood-style happy ending (&quot;Rome the Republic&quot...; ...It was over-the-top feel-goodism.Crowe is pretty darned hammy, there's just no getting away from it. When he shouts to one audience, &quot;Do I entertain you?&quot;, I wish they had shouted back &quot;NO, you hambone, bring in Commodus!&quot; But I guess he fills out a skirt nicely, so the ladies have something to look at. (There sure isn't anything for the guys, 'cause female lead Connie Nielsen, as Commodus' sister Lucilla, is draped chin-to-toe throughout, even when her brother is pawing at her.) Oliver Reed does well as the ex-gladiator running the team, but Richard Harris's Marcus was exhausted to the point of near incomprehensibility. And are we going to be stuck for the next decade with red-lipped, downy-cheeked little boys instead of kids who look like they actually play outside and skin their knees?Digital tomfoolery. Feh. The opening scenes in Germania were simply awful. Totally inexcuseable. For crying out loud, when will the ninnies in Hollywood learn that only SNOW looks like SNOW? I guess it comes from never having seen the stuff themselves, but in this flick, you get feathers and down. That's right - feathers. It is SO obviously filmed through a blue filter on a bright sunny day with feathers drifting about that you wonder who's raiding the henhouse. (By the time the first 30 minutes was over, I wanted to take every filter in Ridley Scott's kit and make him eat them....) Look, at least TRY to film SOME stuff on location if you have a budget like that. But I forget - you're paying for auteur Scott and actors like Crowe and Reed and Phoenix and Harris, plus all the digital scenery - can't afford anything like realistic LOCATION shots. Hell, why bother - why not make it one big cartoon and leave ALL the real world behind? The rest (the Colosseum, Maximus' villa, Rome itself, etc.) - think &quot;Perfect Storm&quot;. NOT convincing. You know, it would be preferable to have painted backdrops (which in effect is what we DO have, only digitally) with better shots of the actors than big screen-filling matte shots. Count me underwhelmed.I didn't bother with all the extras. Go for it you want them - I just don't care enough when you have something SO self-important, over-hyped, and at it's heart hollow and shabby. No kidding - I think Ed Wood *cared* more about his movies than the folks associated with this bloated blintz.SO - no sympathetic characters; hackneyed, trite, cliche-ridden plot; hokey digital effects; emotionally overwrought and JARRINGLY anachronistic soundtrack, plus a large dollop of 1990's-style political correctness, and you have the mediocre mush of &quot;Gladiator&quot;. &quot;Conan&quot; without the cohones, &quot;Spartacus&quot; without the spirit, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; without the....you get the idea.

This disc is what I envisioned when I finally determined it was time for a DVD player.  Sure DVDs have better picture and sound and you can see the film more as it was intended and try to replicate the theater experience.  As a movie buff, the reason I wanted a DVD player was for background information on the movies I loved.  I think it is obvious that this is a great movie, with Oscar nominations galore, but what makes the DVD so special is all the extras.  Along with commentary on the movie, film trailers, and film ads there are numerous little clips cut from the movie during editing, an hour long documentary on gladiators, pictures of the storyboard for the movie and so much more.  You could truly enjoy &amp; explore all the other features on these discs for a long time to come.

The CG panoramic shots of Rome definitely show their age, but the picture and sound are crystal clear, and the story line and action are still spectacular.The reviewers who received the same edition yet are still complaining about image quality may forget that this movie was shot 15 years ago, back in the days of film; Hence the grainy image in many scenes.  I personally didn't find it to be annoying at all.  I would definitely recommend this movie in its current edition to others.

Russell Crowe's acting is very good.  Connie Nielsen's unfortunately isn't until the final scene.  Joaquin Phoenix does ok as the unloved and immature son, but isn't buyable as a ceasar.  the editing and directing and lighting frankly were subpar - it's like this movie wanted so badly to be a Simpson/Bruckheiemer production, but couldn't master the tricks of that genre.  the editing was choppy and intrusive.  the fight scenes were good, but the directing in final night scenes was difficult to follow.  perhaps this was in part due to the measures they had to take to cover for Oliver Reed's untimely death.  it's too bad this movie didn't have a more leisurely pace and a little better acting, character development and plot development.  but this movie was geared toward being a summer blockbuster, not a classic.	4.0	a decent film	2001-06-26	2	1	1

The violence is not gratuituous in nature -- it illustrates the barbaric nature of things back in that century and is actually an important part of the story as a whole.Maximus, the main character, is a person with high moral standards who ends up being kidnapped and sold as a slave ... eventually he ends up a gladiator. I don't want to give away any more of the story, there are surprising details.  Let's just say that you root for Maximus through the film.

That's because anyone who might have,has seen every lame trick in this movie used again and again. I don't know where to begin as the list would be too long.I liked Russell in LA Confidential and that's about it. The mere thought of him having a Best Actor trophy makes me shudder.I  mean, come on-all he had to do to prepare for this role was cut out 5 hours of sleep every night. His routine with the scowling and talking raspy got so old after the first half-hour, I still ask myself why I didn't leave the theatre at any point thereafter. My bad.I will give the movie credit for the few fightscenes that came across as very brutal and somewhat epic, but these moments are basically few and far between. Sets are pretty much flawless and the costumes are well done, both of which create total believability in the environments. Ok, enough with the compliments.Overall, I feel Im being generous giving Gladiator 2 stars, but had it not been for the re-re-re-re-hashed plot, the look and style of the film could have made it the classic so many seem to think this is.

This movie is as historically accurate as Hollywood gets.The Emperor Commodus probably did not have inner child issues portrayed here, but they are well done.The Gladiatorial arena is very vividly and accurately portrayed.  Also the battle scenes are the best ever done.  I think a Roman legionary watching this movie would think that the Roman Army in was for real here.For lovers of history and tragedy, gladiator is your movie.  Take a trip back to the dark side of Rome and the dream that Marcus Aurelius had for it and the nightmare his son Commodus made.For lovers of old movies, this is sort of a redoing of &quot;Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; with Alec Guiness and Steven Boyd.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1V5G1O9TRGO7M	matt	If it weren't for the rousing battle scenes and stunning locales, Ridley Scott's half-hearted epic Gladiator would've been a total flop.  Gladiator is by no means a bad movie, but as far as a great one?  Not even close.Russell Crowe delivers a star making turn as Maximus, a loyal Roman general whose loyality is put to the test when he refuses to follow the orders of the newest emperor (Joaquin Phoenix in a BORING performance).  Accused of treason, Maximus' family is killed and he sentanced to die.  Of course he escapes and begins his unholy quest for revenge against the new emperor.  Gladiator begins with a rousing battle scene and has many to follow, all of the acting credible and the story is undeniably interesting, but there are too many flaws for this one to be considered a masterpiece by any means.  Many of the sequences between the battle scenes almost exist solely for filler purposes, they serve to bring the film from one fight scene to the next.  There is nothing wrong with this type of film, if it weren't pretending to be something more.  Crowe makes for a great action hero, his enemy in this film, Joaquin Phoenix is annoying and sickening.  Phoenix is normally a superb actor, but his character in this film acts the part of the cliched Roman Emperor.  He kills his father, babbles on and on in scene after scene about NOTHING and even pointlessly lusts after his sister.  There is a lot that could've been removed from this film without damaging the story, audiences sometimes think that a long movie automatically makes for a good one.  That is not the case here.  Gladiator is not a bad film, just boring.  Director Scott thinks he's doing a film of more substance than he really has, proof of this comes in the pretentious &quot;death&quot; scene at the finsh.  Comparisons to Braveheart are unfair, this is a bloated Hollywood 'epic', not terrible, not very good, and very unmemorable.  Whereas Braveheart used gruesome battle scenes to move the story along, Gladiator seems to exist FOR the battle scenes, they are incredible, but to find something else of value in this film is the real challenge.  It's hollow, pointless and pretty limp.  Another case of Hollywood going through the motions.  Some will like it, others will agree with me, but in the end, it's all in the opinion.	3.0	Simply Overrated...	2000-10-17	9	4	5

Marcus actually had little choice in this matter: Either make Commodus the new emperor, or have him executed.It seems unlikely that the son would have murdered his father, as Commodus was Marcus' named successor, and was already officially a joint emperor.Once in power as the only rulng Caesar, Commodus led a generally shameless regime. His sister Lucilla did conspire with a few senators to have him assassinated, and when the plot failed, he had the senators executed and his sister banished and then executed. From there, his reign was characterized more or less by viciousness, caprice, and insanity. He renamed Rome the 'Colonia Commodiana' (Colony of Commodus), envisioned himself to be the Greek god Hercules, and entered the arena as a gladiator to fight man and beast. His unpopularity appears to have grown until, when he made known that he intended to instate himself as consul on New Year's Day, 193, several of his advisors conspired to have him murdered. Commodus was strangled by a professional wrestler on the night of 31 December 192. Civil war followed his death.Much of Ridley Scott's Roman-era epic GLADIATOR wanders into fictional territory, despite the rootedness of a few individuals in actual history. Of course, this is nothing new. From ""Spartacus"" to ""Shakespeare in Love"" and beyond, studios and producers have used their story-telling talents to expand and explore, creating tapestries that range from very historical to almost entirely (or entirely) nonhistorical.So why have I given GLADIATOR five stars? Because it works well - very well - on the narrative level! As someone else has suggested, it is not really a biopic. Before the movie premiered in theaters most people on the street would be hard pressed to recount very much about the historical persons involved. Instead, here is a story with interesting characters going through some provocative change and circumstance, in which the two subset stories of (1) Commodus & Lucilla in Rome and (2) Maximus in Africa come together for an almost fate-initiated clash of calculating spite that climaxes in a slave-versus-emperor face-off in the Colosseum (then known as the Flavian Amphitheater). The story exhibits a respectable measure of originality; plot lines are largely not predictable.The Roman Empire is reaching the zenith of its power and glory, spanning three continents, from Spain to Judea, from the Danube to the Nile. Emperor Marcus Aurelius - having concluded his military campaign against the Germanic barbarians - must now find someone to serve as 'the protector of Rome' (pending the Senate's readiness to rule). He knows his son Commodus is too corrupt for the position, so he appoints his now-favorite general, Maximus Decimus Meridius, for the role. When Marcus Aurelius breaks the news to his hopeful son, Commodus throws a fit, and father tries to comfort only to be suffocated by his scheming progeny. Commodus assumes emperorship, and when Maximus declines to pay homage, the young Caesar orders his execution, and his family's. Maximus foils the attempt on his own life and escapes, but not in time to save his wife and son. Distraught over the loss of his family, the former general is sold into slavery, to be trained as a gladiator. When the trainer learns that 'the games' have been instituted, he - and Gladiator Maximus - head to Rome for an unforgettable matchup.Sure, Marcus' (and the Senate's) desire to ""give power back to the people"" sounds rather modern, as the Roman Senate of 1800-plus years ago was not as 'democratic' as is the United States Senate - though we may label it a few steps toward the idea - and that and other elements enrich the story, making it more palatable for [modern Western] viewers.Quality performances by Harris, Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen, and Reed. Other strong appearances by Jacobi and Hounsou add to the appeal. Plus great directing by Ridley Scott (especially during the action sequences), well-positioned cinematography, and a rousing score. For all of its shortcomings in the historical files, GLADIATOR has scope and grandeur.P.S. For those who wish to learn more, various online sites offer some information about Marcus Aurelius, Commodus (and perhaps Lucilla) and about the world of the time in general, but the best source is probably Encyclopedia Britannica 2004."	5.0	Impressive!	2004-11-30	4	4	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	Film, more than any other art, has the wherewithal to create an epic tale. One reason is that the medium is literally larger than life. The screen exaggerates everything. Another reason is that most people who make movies are gamblers by nature. They often invest staggering sums of money on a single movie. Sometimes, they hit the jackpot. The three most successful movies of all time are Gone with the Wind, Star Wars, and Titanic. Each had an epic tale to tell. Each cost a fortune, made back an even larger fortune, and became legend in the public's eyes. Since Titanic was released just three years ago, it appears that this form of movie making is as popular as ever. This year we have Gladiator. Financially it did well, though grossing nowhere near what the Big Three did. Artistically, it's as good as almost epic I can think of. It certainly disproves the notion that the 'sword and sandal' movie is dead and buried.The place is the Roman Empire. The time is the Second Century AD. A Roman army, led by Maximus [Russell Crowe], is ready to wage a decisive battle against fierce Germanian troops. Winning the battle will bring to Rome and its emperor, Marcus Aurelius [Richard Harris], peace for the first time in years. Marcus has been at the battle front for many months and is now joined by his children, Cummodus [Joaquin Phoenix] and Lucilla [Connie Nielson]. After the battle, which is a most intense and brilliantly orchestrated piece of film making, Marcus gives Maximus, whom he loves like a son, many new responsibilities, though Maximus wants nothing more than to return to his farm in Spain and to his wife and son. The treacherous and insane Cummodus, terrified that Maximus will prevent his succeeding to the throne, plots to have Maximus killed. While the hero escapes, he pays a terrible price and winds up becoming the gladiator of the title. Lucilla, who also loves Maximus, can do nothing, for fear that Cummodus will harm her young son.In Gladiator Russell Crowe has finally found his way to major stardom. He is perfect as Maximus, giving him a macho facade that masks a loyal, caring and intelligent man. Joaquin Phoenix gives the best performance of his career to date as Cummodus. The two actors make formidable onscreen adversaries in several chilling scenes, most of which take place in a nicely rendered vision of the Roman Coliseum as it might have appeared all those years ago. Connie Nielson gives the wily and brilliant Lucilla a majesty reminiscent of Cate Blanchette in Elizabeth. Bringing added depth to the movie are three older actors - Richard Harris, Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi. Harris and Reed were major stars in their own right in the early 1960s and early 1970s. Sadly, Reed died just after completing his role, and Gladiator is dedicated to him.Director Ridley Scott is one of the best, bringing elegance, style and substance to most of his movies. He had directed such diverse pictures as Alien, Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise.	5.0	Oustanding reinvention of the 'sword and sandal' genre	2002-03-18	1	0	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3JZ5L52FM318H	"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen"""	"First things first:I have watched this Blu-Ray disc in my home theater environment. I am not reviewing this based on screen shots on a PC monitor. I really think this is the only fair way to truly evaluate a film, which is inherently a moving medium that is intended for viewing in a darkened, controlled environment.The Blu-Ray:Paramount's ""Sapphire Series"" has debuted with a double-barreled blast of action - Gladiator and Braveheart. But one of the rounds didn't fire, and I'm sorry to say it was this one (On the other hand, Braveheart is probably the finest HD video transfer of a 90's film EVER).Video is problematic throughout. The beginning shots of the film, which feature a text intro superimposed on a background of golden mist, betray serious color banding and posterization - usually a sign of Digital Noise Reduction or Edge Enhancement gone awry. And while DNR is tamed to some extent for the rest of the film, EE remains present throughout.Had these effects been present throughout the whole film, it might not have been as noticeable. However, the ""Extended Edition"" features scenes which were edited into the film from a 2005 master - and these shots show much more fine detail, much less edge halo, and better color fidelity. So it kind of slaps you in the face when you return to the film proper.I do not want to give the impression that I freeze-frame my way through an entire film looking for problems. I try to let it breathe, and if it is still a pleasing presentation despite flaws, to enjoy it on its own terms. ""Gladiator"" does deliver in this respect. I would say that 10% of the film, and not just the new footage, is competitive with some of the better Blu-Ray discs out there. Usually, the strongest elements are close-up shots of faces and armor. Well-lit scenes fare much better than dark ones, too, which is unfortunate, since Ridley Scott has such a dark, muddied hand for cinematography.But when it's bad, it's almost DVD-level bad. Medium and distance shots, especially the Rome fly-over upon Commodus' return as emperor, are positively CRAWLING with false information created by edge enhancement. Black levels also refuse to remain steady in darker scenes - some are nice and inky, while others are a gray mush.At its best, this BD looks better than the previous two DVDs. But at its worst, it aggravates anyone who truly craves top notch HD. If you're a casual user, this probably won't bother you terribly. But if you are an A/V junkie, be warned.The soundtrack is fine, in a generally well-balanced DTS-HD track.Extras include two strong commentaries, an EXTREMELY long and exhaustive making of feature on disc 2, and many, many, many small vignettes on Roman history, production, and all sorts of minutiae. It really is an impressive assortment, except that all, sadly, are in Standard Definition.So essentially, Paramount did everything right with this edition of Gladiator, with one small exception - the film itself.The Film:In my opinion, ""Gladiator"" has not aged well. This is probably more a statement about me than about the film. When I first saw it, I found it an engaging swords and sandals affair with a nice historical flair and a rousing storyline. I've now seen it a good 10 times, though, over the past 10 years. I'm sad to say I now find it rather trite and pat Hollywood storytelling, especially when contrasted with the much more interesting real history of Rome.To be fair, as Russel Crowe bellows in the protagonist's role, ""are you not entertained?"" It's still a rousing action spectacle. Crowe is an action star par excellence, as well as a fine dramatic actor. Joaquin Phoenix cuts a dashing and creepy figure as the villain, Commodus. Various supporting characters are also nicely portrayed.But it just rings so empty. Many characters are posterboard cut-outs, only serving to advance the plot, without an internal life of their own. If you want to see a telling contrast, watch Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus,"" another gladiatorial epic. Granted, that film has the likes of Kirk Douglas, Peter Ustinov, and Laurence Olivier, who would have to strain to make a bad movie, but still. As they say, ""If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage."" Well, it's just not on the page here.Much of the problem, in my opinion, rests with the film's utterly ham-fisted treatment of historical events (another Scott dud, ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" suffered the same faults). There really was a Commodus who succeeded Marcus Aurelius, and he really did fight in a few gladiatorial games. But that's where the film departs with reality. The writers seem dead-set on draining the real events and persons of all possible subtlety, and on reducing the story to a trite hero-vs.-villain tale, in which the heroes fight for democracy, and the villains want to french-kiss their sisters (See also: ""300"".)In the end, it's a big, dumb action spectacle. If decapitations and gushing spurts of blood are your thing, you will not be disappointed. Perhaps that's all I wanted when I was 20. But I guess I'm older and wiser now, and I need my entertainment to suit those things, too.Conclusion:I am rating this Blu-Ray on the quality of the disc itself, not on the film. I may just be in a curmudgeonly mood at the moment on the content. It is still entertaining. Maybe it will even inspire a viewer or two to research the real story.But as a Blu-Ray, consumers should know what they're in for. A/V enthusiasts will find a disc that only meets the standards of some of the early Blu-Rays from 2006. It is by no means a perfect presentation. It also seems unlikely that Paramount will re-issue this disc any time soon. So it's a tough recommendation.If you're a more casual viewer, however, or if you have a smaller screen (40 inches or less), the faults of this transfer will probably not be as evident or mean as much to you.So call it a qualified recommendation with a caveat emptor for the enthusiast crowd.Are you not entertained?"	3.0	"*Blu-Ray Specific Review* Probably not the stunning debut Paramount was hoping for with ""Sapphire Series"""	2009-09-11	24	20	4
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3Q06LH9C5GG5K	Matt Hruslinski	Few movies come along during our lives that make us stop in our tracks and take notice.  The star-loaded action movies always grab attention but that is to be expected.  Gladiator doesn't fall into that genre.  Ridley Scott's epic of Roman General, Maximus (played by Russel Crowe) is a movie that commands attention.  From the intricately detailed by battle sequences at the beginning to the monstrous recreation of Rome (albeit computer enhanced), Gladiator is every bit as good as the critics and media have praised it to be.Since buying the DVD version shortly after Christmas, having seing it when it first came out in theaters in May, I've only enhanced my appreciation for it.  As it says on the case &quot; The General who became a slave.  The Slave who became a gladiator.  The Gladiator who defied an emperor.&quot;  That is really all of the story that you need to know if you have not seen this film.  To give any more away spoils the movie.On the musical side, Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard composed a score that is as moving as it is dramatic.  Nearly of the score coincides directly with key points in the film and add just that extra touch to the scene.  I don't think there has been a score quite to match it in the last few years.Comparisions with Braveheart and other movies like it are evident but this film stands on it's own.  Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix (as Commodus) and Scott give their all in the movie of the year for 2000.  Anyone who hasn't yet seen Gladiator owes it to themselves to purchase it.  You won't regret it.	5.0	Gladiator, Directed by Ridley Scott	2001-01-14	4	4	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3RN55YRON2DY1	Matt McDougall	In Gladiator, Commodus says he will show the people a vision of Rome - and that is exactly what this film gives us, a vision.  Do not watch this film (or any other Roman epic, for that matter) expecting historical accuracy, watch it for the vision of Rome, which is the best that we have yet witnessed, from the bustling city streets to the torn up forests of Germania.  At the film's core, of course, are the massive spectacles of the Collosseum, which are captured quite faithfully.  There is a wonderful deleted scene on the DVD where Maximus witnesses Christians being fed to the lions between gladiator contests.  This scene shows the horror and depravity of the Roman mob through the eyes of an innocent child, clutching his mother on the sandy floor of the arena.In addition to grand spectacle, this is probably the best DVD I have ever purchased with regard to technical detail.  The deleted scenes and documentaries are a very novel touch.  Some films have a few deleted scenes, but 25 minutes' worth!?!If you have a DTS setup for your home theater, BUY THIS DVD.  I watched it with my parents at their home over Thanksgiving and had major reservations about the big screen spectacle's translation onto video, and then I got home and popped it in my DTS system.  I cannot begin to explain the awe - the sound editing on this movie should win an Oscar.  If it weren't R rated, every high-end home theater store would be showing this film to show of DVD and DTS capability.	5.0	A Vision of Rome - in DTS	2000-11-28	29	25	4

This isn't an action film, it's about a man who must go threw the trials a tribulations to become a hero. Maximus should be compared to other notorious characters, like Travis Bickle, Rocky, and Don Corleone. ""Gladiator also deserves to be compared to ""Spartacus"", ""Braveheart"", and ""Ben-Hur.""

It was remarkably like Ben Hur.  All it needed was Charlton Heston, a chariot race, and a few lepers.  The background music was less than subtle.  The music in itself was very nice, but the viewer gets beat over the head with the &quot;choir of angels&quot; bit.  I heard a great deal about Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the evil Commodus as well.  There were a few moments when he was very much like the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood:  Prince of Thieves.  Instead of saying &quot;I am vexed!&quot;, I was waiting for him to say, &quot;That's it!  Christmas is cancelled!&quot; (at least Alan Rickman was comical and enteratining as well as menacing).

But the biggest surprise is Joaquin Phoenix. I'd never heard of him, as many people probably had never heard of him, till this movie. Then you leave saying &quot;who IS that guy?&quot;. He's good everyone, and he makes you love him and really, really hate him. He emotes through entire movie, whether its hatred, lust, or this anonymous feeling that makes you pity him. Then there are the supporting characters that make this such an ensemble piece, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris, they all do their part and make is superb.The cinematography is good;  the score has some high points and low points; the plot twists in a way that would make Shakespeare proud.There are aspects of this movie that are new to the movie scene, such as some of the themes, acting styles, and plot twists, and overall it has this power to it that nearly blows you away. It sucks you in from the first scene and doesn't let go till the very last , very intense, scene of the movie .

Extras are a large part of the amazement, and Gladiator delivers is like only a few other DVD's have in the past (ie - Criterion Collection Armageddon, or The Abyss Special Edition).  This two disk feature provides top quality sound and picture, behind the scenes featurettes, detailed cast/crew bios, deleted scenes and oh so much more.  The film itself is a fantastic production, well acted and produced, and serves up healthy portions of action and politcal intrigue.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A164X7DBL5LZ15	Michael Cigledy	After hearing all the hype about Gladiator, I was dissappointed to see it for myself ( DVD version ). I was told that the fight scenes were good, and they were, but the rest of the movie is just filler. There is almost no plot whatsoever, and what little there is is so incredibly predictable it's almost sad. The best part of the 2 disc DVD set is the real history of the gladitorial games on the second disc. Give this one a miss.	2.0	Where's the Plot?	2000-12-17	5	1	4
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3QFC8X23IR3QC	"Michael C. Smith ""MGMboy@aol.com"""	"After forty years the Epic Roman film is revised and reborn in unmatched magnificence. The new age of the ancient world in film arises under the vision of Ridley Scott and presents us with the Oscar winning star making performance by Russell Crowe.Now that we have the wonders of computer graphics there is no place that film makers can not take us and no world past, present of future they can not create in ways that would a few years ago proven cost prohibitive.The demise of the ancient Epic of the early 60's may have been in part due to the fact that to recreate Rome, Greece, or Egypt with any degree of splendor studios had to build full sized sets and people them with thousands of extras. See as superb examples of this real time expensive film style illustrated in ""Cleopatra"" 1963 or ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" 1964 (Which has many parallels to ""Gladiator""). But today we can revisit this old genre and make it exciting and new with our technological advancements in film.Scott and his collaborators have given new life and spawned a new generation of epic such as the upcoming ""Troy"" and ""Alexander"" with this impressive and exciting film.The only thing I found disturbing in the recreation of Rome was that it was painted in terracotta's and blacks. I would have preferred to see the riot of color that Rome actually was. But beyond this nitpicking I am thrilled by what I see on the screen.But for the first time viewer there awaits the visceral impact of Russell Crowe's creation of Maximus.  Truly a star turn that few actors of his generation could achieve. He fills the screen, the film, the very era with authority, strength, and even tenderness and proves here that there is nothing this fine talent cannot do. With Maximus he transfigures his screen persona to the Elysium of the greats such as Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, and Paul Newman.Scott has surrounded his star with stellar supporting performers who add to the film with talent and in some cases just the right touch of humor.The music by Hans Zimmer, which by now is much imitated in TV miniseries of late, recalls the greatness of Rozsa and Alex North and adds dimension and scope to the picture.The cinematography by John Mathieson, particularly in the opening scenes in Germania is of such skill and beauty that the viewer is transported to the 1st Century A.D.The DVD is chock full of wonderful extras including a hilarious parody trailer for ""Chicken Run"" (this is an Easter egg. Just look for the Roman eagle on Richard Harris' breastplate.)""Gladiator"" is a supreme effort and well deserving of it's many laurels."	5.0	Epic Splendor Reborn	2004-05-13	2	1	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3D2RRDEHSETZ0	Michael D Delcour	Gladiator has all the makings of an extraordinarily entertaining film: intense action, thrilling sound track, solid acting, and, of course, Russell Crowe.  Ridley Scott put together an awe-inspiring film of epic proportions.  The recreated Rome is stunning, especially the Coliseum.  If there is a downside to this movie, its that the action sequences are just too exciting, leaving the audience a little bored with the dramatic aspects of the film.  But no worries; there is always an action sequence lurking around the corner.Russell Crowe puts in a great performance, and he handles the action sequence with the same ease as he handles the dramatic sequences (Anyone who's seen &quot;The Insider&quot; knows this man can act).  Lesser-knowns Connie Nelson and Joaquin Phoenix put in solid performances as well.  Joaquin Phoenix seems especially well suited as the evil emperor Commodus.Historians are bound to have problems with the inaccuracies of this film, but &quot;Gladiator&quot; isn't meant to be a lesson in history.  It's meant to excite, and it does that extremely well.The DVD edition of the film is exceptionally well done, featuring a documentary of the history of the gladiators (that's where you can get your lesson in history), and a great assortment of parts that were cut from the film with director commentary.  If you're looking for a great film to add to your DVD collection, you can't go wrong with &quot;Gladiator.&quot;	5.0	The Most Entertaining Picture of the Year	2001-07-27	2	2	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A16XRPF40679KG	Michael Dobey	Amazon.com needs to seperate reviews.  Blu ray reviews should NOT be lumped in with standard dvd releases.  The blu ray version of this movie is far superior to the standard dvd version. Both in picture and sound quality. The movie itself features great performances from the whole cast inlcluding the late Oliver Reed who died in Italy right as this was being finished.  The fictional story of the evil emporer Commodus and his betrayel of his top general is a interesting one.  In real life Rome had just had a number of great emporers : Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian and then Marcus Aurelius who was Commodus's father. All of these men had fought on the frontiers and made the empire strong , they were excellent emporers and then came the degenerate partier Commodus.  He fought in the gladitioral games and spent the empires money on his desires while the frontiers were being attacked.  He was cruel and finally killed and that was a good thing for the world.  But he was in charge for many years and not a few months like in this movie.  Still the movie captures his evil nature very well as does the actor who protays him,  and it presents a story about revenge.  This is a good movie in spite of this historical misstep.  After all they couldn't have the main character fight for ten years waiting for revenge.  On blu ray this movie really comes alive and from this point on is the only way to watch it.	4.0	a sort of historically accurate movie that is still great. but blu ray is better	2009-09-06	15	6	9
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1WGF3DAX2WUV0	Michael Dyckman	Russell Crowe has a definite presence on the big screen and he makes Gladiator his own as Maximus, a general in ancient Rome. Beginning with an impressively staged battle in Germany, Crowe embodies this warrior with his whole being. The favorite of Richard Harris' Caesar to take over Rome, Crowe refuses, and ends up as a slave whose only existence is to fight in the arenas, where most of the warriors die very young deaths. Maximus sees this as his chance to redeem himself.Besides Crowe's terrific performance, Harris and the late Oliver Reed, as Profumo, Maximus' master, deliver wonderful performances.The special effects are amazing as well, from the battle and action sequences, to the renderings of the Colosseum and ancient Rome. Gladiator is a top-notch action film, and one that signals Russell Crowe as a major star on the rise.	4.0	Amazing Crowe and action	2000-09-29	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2W93T2X3TDM9J	Michael F. Maddox	Wonderful action, great characters, perfect musical score, what else do we need?  The DVD only adds to the movie's greatness, with the addition of commentary, behind-the-scenes video, and more.  Sure, this isn't exactly the most historically accurate movie ever made, but it IS a wonderful bit of fiction, sure to satisfy the most hardened action lover, with enough intrigue and romance to fill the needs of others, too.As an avid &quot;Romanophile,&quot; I have some issues with the portrayal of Rome as merely a blood-thirsty population of savages, plus numerous inaccuracies in staging (I even found myself trying to see how they solved the problem of canopies in the Colosseum). Still, the movie, as a whole, sucks you in, and suspends even the most scholarly disbelief (even knowing that the armor is injection-molded resin ...  This is what epic Roman stories SHOULD be like.

This was an average movie plagued with clich&eacute;s and themes already covered by better films.I loved the first battle scene. It was beautiful, despite the death and destruction taking place. However, once that scene is over, the movie takes a steady nose-dive through the rest of the film. From the death of his wife, the gladiator imprisonment and ""Spartacus-esque"" training sequences, the villains idiotic decision that taking on the most successful gladiator in Rome could be a good idea (not to mention he's got the jones for his sister), right down to the ""I've seen that so many times before!"" ending, there wasn't really an original idea in the whole picture. Top that off with what literally looks like dirt and dust the director forgot to wash off the film reel, and you get a ho-hum movie that's probably only worth watching for the fight scenes."	2.0	Hardly the Best	2000-11-27	3	1	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A30CULRZ756V0G	Michael Kramer	We all know Russell Crowe rocks in this film, but let's give Joaquin Phoenix his dues!  Without him as the antagonist you love to hate, this film wouldve had to survive solely on the merits of the fight scenes.  I love a good villian I can't stand.  This up and coming actor plays this character to the hilt, even calling up a few tears to make you want to slap him for being such a sissy cry-baby!  The opening battle sequence I would have to liken to the opening of Saving Private Ryan (not quite as intense, but darn close and as bloody).  Russel Crowe's intense emotional potrayal of Maximus is worthy of 5 stars alone!

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2JU4FUSW1PBEC	Michael Pappalardo	This is by far one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  Russel Crowe definitely earned his Best Actor award in this movie.  Joaquin Phoenix is also excellent in this movie, his performance was underrated.  The story itself is moving and gripping, you actually feel something for the characters.  Many 'historians' criticise this movie because of the innacurate events that take place in the movie.  It is clearly stated at the end of the movie that it is based on events in history that have been altered, and it is a work of fiction.Ther story itself does not drag, and is very moving.  Maximus Desimus Meridias, a general in Emperor Marcus Aurrelius' Legion is betrayed when the son of the Emperor finds out that he wants to pass his powers to Maximus when he dies.  Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix) gives an exemplary performance as the son of Marcus, who in jealousy kills his father to prevent him from announcing the passage of power to Maximus.  When Maximus refuses to pledge loyalty to Commodus, he is ordered to be executed, but escapes.  Afterward, a horrific chain of events leaves Maximus with no more than a quest for vengeance, when he is picked up by a slave trader and turned into a Gladiator.  Describing the movie does it no justice.  It must be seen through your eyes to be fully appreciated.  Ridley Scott once again directs a maserpiece.The acting is great, and this can definitely be the movie that made Russel Crowe.  Joaquin Phoenix also gave a memorable performance, and it was very disappointing not to see him win the award for best supporting actor.  Wonderful movie, do not miss this, whatever you do.  You will NOT be disappointed.	5.0	A moving epic, can't be missed!	2001-05-31	8	6	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2FVUYZ8BWTPH1	Michael R. Cooke	This is a sand and sandals gladiator epic with flair and intrigue. The plot is just a little too trite, the picture just a bit too long and the often pretentious dialogue is just so-so but the acting in support, the grand cinematography, the totally enveloping big sound and the magnificent battle staging, along with great computer special effects, all combine to make this one of the best action movies of the year! You get sucked in in spite of its flaws. Crowe is quite good as Maximus but I feel he was better in L.A. Confidential a few years ago. Here he nobly struts around as a killing machine with the right amount of angst and honorable rage.  However, the supporting players really make this movie work. Joaquin Phoenix pouts, sulks, lusts, romps and schemes his way through his juicy role as Commodus, Maximus' evil foil (Academy members take note!). Wthout Phoenix, Crowe would be just another well-built dirty slave waiting to nobly die in the gladiatorial dust. It is true here that the star brings the masses in but the villain actually makes the movie work as entertaining art. Connie Nielson projects just the right air of conniving, jaded  sadness as the Emperor's sister and Maximus' former lover. Oliver Reed as the cynical former gladiator who saves Maximus for the battle pits is convincingly world-weary, waiting for his redemption to come. Richard Harris is also fine in a small but integral part as the failing Roman emperor whose murder by Commodus acts as the catalyst for the subsequent machinations of the main players. Finally, Crowe's adoring gladiator buddies provide excellent redemptive &quot;backup&quot; for him at the proper times later in the picture. I saw this movie for the first time in the big screen theater and I was not all that impressed at that time. It took a second and even a third viewing on my home theater screen to really appreciate the fine work and detail that went into making this a superior entertainment. Comparisons to Kirk Douglas' Spartacus are inevitable. In many ways this picture is better made and has more to say about life, love and honor than even that old classic. Perhaps the extreme budget differential between the two plays a major role in that assessment but the bottom line for the discerning viewer is that this picture can stand alone against the best of its peers and still come out on top as an entertainment with a message. This is enjoyable escapist fare and comes highly recommended!	4.0	A toga picture to Crowe about!	2001-01-09	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2JH15SN3J5MCJ	Michael Sympson	"Personally I liked that film - especially the soundtrack. A film is of course not a history lesson. Still I don't see the harm if the producers had cared to stay closer to the circumstantial facts. Armory and clothing came close enough, except for crossbows, the Alsacean breed of the dog  and the cell phone an extra had dropped in the second part. Especially Lucilla's haute couture came straight from wall paintings in Pompeii.It looks good on the screen to see the Roman infantry trot up to their enemies in close formation and take cover behind their shields when the barbarians fired a volley of arrows. However that's not how it was done in those days. The Roman legioner was not a Greek hoplite who held formation with shields locked. The Roman infantry man had three paces of open space to his neighbors left and right, giving room for his moves. The second rank spread accordingly covering the gaps behind the first rank etc.So instead of losing momentum and stop to receive the arrows and take the full shock of the opponent's onrush the Roman legion would pick up the pace, discharge their ""pilum"" - the spear or javelin- and go straight for the kill. A legioner coming at you would do exactly the same move, Shaka used to teach his Zulu warriors 1,500 years later: a sweeping move with the shield would deflect the opponents defense and the sword or assagai would go straight for the kill in one decisive stab into the undefended side.Both, Shaka and the Romans kept the blade deliberately short, so that the fighter had to go on close quarter - which actually is an advantage because it leaves the opponent fewer options for fancy moves. Perhaps Hollywood is thinking that this industrial killing technique doesn't make good film-copy? In Shaka Zulu's case it was still effective enough to annihilate a complete British brigade fully equipped with Springfield rifles and field artillery.The main thing of course are the gladiatorial combat scenes. In the film it is very simple: every gladiator is a slave (or convicted criminal), every encounter a fight to the death. Not so in ancient Rome: many gladiators were actually free born people from all walks of life - in one instance even an emperor - who had chosen the arena as a career. But like the professional boxers in modern times, or the Japanese sumo wrestlers, a fully trained gladiator was obliged to enlist in the stable of a licensed impresario.Not every fight was a mortal combat. In fact far less than 30% of all combats ended with a kill. Gladiators fought for money, even slaves received a purse. (Slavery in antiquity didn't mean loss of wages: an enslaved mason received the same minimum wages as his free colleague, the difference being that the slave's owner took out his cut.) There were contract rates for different kinds of performance; comparably low for feigned combats to show off the combatants skills in good clean entertainment at, say, weddings and funerals. Only an extremely rich patron could actually afford to pay the rates for mortal encounters.Historians also like to quibble at Proximo's accusation that Marcus Aurelius had shut down the arenas, apparently for humanitarian reasons. The truth here is that Marcus Aurelius, a civilian to boot, was forced to fend off an invasion from Persia. His generals performed brilliantly and even invaded Iraqi territory. But among the trophies they also brought back the small pox. The epidemic ravaged the Empire for a whole 15 years and reduced the army to a mere skeleton force, of which every hostile tribe from across the border took due notice. So the civilian Marcus Aurelius suddenly found himself confronted with the task to rebuild the army practically from scratch and to wage war on the intruders. He partly accomplished this by drafting all the gladiators, whether free or slave, from all over the empire. So the arenas closed for lack of fighters. So far I see no reason why the film could not have reflected these facts more faithfully.That the emperor was assassinated is Hollywood's favorite myth. There is no evidence for a plot on his life. As a matter of fact - but this would of course spoil the story - Commodus was already co-emperor for six years before Marcus Aurelius died in the camp of exhaustion and disease. This was the whole idea: one Caesar at home and one in the field, so that the surviver would guarantee continuity. Commodus continued to reign without causing complaints for another six years, and only changed to the worse after a failed plot on his life. From then on his eccentricities ruined his reputation and he died in 192 from a mysterious ""accident"" in the gym."	4.0	very watchable	2003-02-17	3	2	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3L46ZRKNFN0SG	Michael W. Howe	The critics lovd it, and almost everyone who went to see it at the movie theater i worked at did as well: even I enjoyed it!  Gladiator was a film that actually took the heroic plot and turned it into a grand epic, that I would have to compare to my movie going experience when I saw &quot;Titanic&quot; in December of 1997.  Russell Crowe plays Maximus Decimus Meridius, a Roman General, who is at the command of Marcus Aurillius, an aging Emperor.  While Marcus's son (Joaquin Phoenix) is supposed to be the next ruler, Marcus wants Maximus to lead Rome to a new future.  But upon hearing this news, Marcus's son Commodus destroys him, and proceeds to have Maximus killed as well as his wife and son.  Maximus survives, but soon finds that he has been enslaved.  Wanting revenge for this deed, he uses his skills as a general to make it all the way to the great Colliseum, where he befriend several other gladiators, and with their skills, they triumph in the face of the evil Commodus; but that's not the end of the story;)  Mill films does a grand job for a European FX company in relaizing the Colliseum and shots of a city that no longer can be constructed in our world.  The shots at times cut short and seem to be filmed on separate kinds of filmstock, but the cinematography is much better than what John Woo did on MI2.  On a final note, there isn't as much blood and gore as most would think, but still, if you have children, I caution you to not let them watch this.  Even though Maximus is a heroic general and all, be responsible with what your children view.	4.0	One of the few good films of the summer!	2000-10-03	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"Does anyone truly remember the golden age of cinema anymore? It was the era when the screen was lit up with lavish epic-dramas set against ancient backdrops such as Greece or Rome, where the likes of Kirk Douglas and Charlton Heston fully controlled the attention of movie-going audiences across the country for three-plus hours, and when going to the movies cost you under a dollar (and that was including popcorn and soda-pop). Well it seems the studio executives in Hollywood are becoming quite nostalgic as they are willing to take a risk and return motion pictures back to the genre that many thought was dead long ago. And it was Gladiator, a film that contained what many thought was a washed-up director and no-name leading man, that resurrected the ""ancient"" genre thanks to its nearly $200 million domestic haul, massive DVD release, and its five Academy Awards wins including Best Picture. Now Hollywood is going all out in, what they hope will be, the new golden age of cinema complete with lavish three hour epic-dramas, gladiatorial and militant battle sequences, and overly-oiled up leading men ... if only they could be convinced to bring back old ticket prices, only then would we be truly satisfied but perhaps that is asking too much too soon.The story center on a man who was once in the service of a vast ancient empire commanding troops in grand feats of battle but now serves merely as entertainment in the gladiatorial events fighting for his life. Maximus Decimus Meridius was one of the greatest generals the Roman Empire had ever seen in that he courageously fought in battle, won the field when he was commanded to do so, and retained the loyalty and devotion of his troops. Here was a man truly a rare sight in the area of leadership, one that could, if given the opportunity to, lead Rome back to its former glory as a republic and not an empire. That is what the current emperor, Marcus Aurelius, sees in him and why he choose Maximus over his son Commodus to take control of Rome when he dies. Unfortunately Commodus suffocates his father before the announcement can be made public and orders Maximus to be secretly done away with. After escaping from his captors and returning home to find his wife and son crucified, he is taken by slave traders and made into a gladiator meant to kill other slaves for the enjoyment of the veracious crowds. When he is entered in the gladiatorial games in Rome, he sets out to enact his revenge on Commudus, either in this life or the next, all the in the effort of seeking retribution for the deaths of his innocent family. The story for Gladiator, though marred with numerous historical inaccuracies, is quite honestly one of the most entertaining and visually engaging epic-dramas in years. Though it is not the most original story line one could come up with (it borrows heavily from Hamlet and other Shakespearian plays), the plot does manage to keep the audience's attention even against a lengthy two hour and forty minute running time.Gladiator is one of the rare shining example for the rest of Hollywood ... a $100 million budgeted epic does not need tremendously famous leading men and women to be successful as long as the cast members that are used in the film are suited to their roles and work cohesively well together on screen, which this film demonstrates in spades. The role of Maximus Decimus Meridius is quite possibly Russell Crowe's most commanding performance to date, with the only exception being his role as Captain Jack Aubrey in the naval drama, Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World. He successfully transitions his character from a dynamic general in the beginning of the film to a barbaric gladiator by the mid-way point of the film, and yet at the same time he maintains some of those leadership qualities that made the character so enduring to begin with. Another relatively unknown, at the time of this film's release, actor who manages to light up the screen was Joaquin Phoenix with his exuberant and often disturbing performance as the Emperor Commodus. The character is so overly emotional, viciously conniving, and eerily mysterious that one can't help but have extreme hatred for him from the moment you first see on screen. Phoenix does a tremendous job at emotionally setting a character that you are meant to hate, which only fuels already fervent enthusiasm for Maximus as he progresses through the film. Possibly the only slightly famous name on the list of cast members belongs to the late veteran actor, Richard Harris, though the only people who may have really recognized his name would have been film enthusiasts and fans of his work. Harris presents a character that, although he is the emperor of a vast empire, is frail and grandfather-like in manner and actions, which makes his death scene all the more excruciating to watch. And praise must also be given to Connie Nielsen, the only woman of the cast, who showcases a strong and caring woman trapped between the wishes of her dead father, the brutality of her powerful brother, and her enduring love for Maximus. It is not till the final sequence of the film till we see her fully come into her own and present it a way that is eloquent and yet commanding at the same time.Overall, Gladiator successfully resurrects the once dead epic genre albeit more sanguineous, vicious and gut-wrenching then its golden age predecessors. Visually, and emotionally, this film is nearly perfect with Ridley Scott's direction taking the ancient world of Rome and presenting to the movie-going audience that is neither overwhelming nor is it trivial to their view of the story at hand in this film. The only major complaint that can be made about this film is its constant lack of respect, or reverence, to historical events and characters involved in the plot of the film. One can say that this is an action-drama that is not meant to be played out for historical purposes but the fact that it deliberately takes historical figures and twists their lives to make them more interesting for the overall plot of the film should be disturbing to many educators, though, it must be clearly noted, that this is hardly the first, nor last, time Hollywood is guilty of such a crime. But taking the film, despite all of that, for what it is, Gladiator is one of the most enthralling and emotionally compelling dramas of 2000, though not at quite the level of being the best picture of the year."	4.0	The Moose Hole - 'Gladiator' Resurrects Golden Age of Cinema	2004-05-12	2	1	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1JW7M9QIIZN8A	"""miezee"""	Russell Crowe brings something indescribable to this movie...I think it is a kind of tempered stoicism, a deep sadness to match the gladiatorial exterior.This is a story set in the grandeur of ancient Rome. The emperor does not think his son, Commodus, is fit for the throne, so he plans to make General Maximus, played by Russell Crowe, the next emperor. Commodus overhears, and kills his father, after which he attempts to kill Maximus, but fails.Maximus becomes a low slave, and, eventually, a gladiator. He is heartbroken, for his wife and son have been killed by Commodus.The ending of the movie is bittersweet. Maximus neither entirely triumphs or entirely fails. But this movie is definitely a great one.	5.0	Epic	2002-12-30	2	0	2

Well as soon the video edition came out in my video club i only rent it because of the oscars it had won and i was courious. The first 5 minutes was enough to change my mind. Almoust perefct in every way : the director (THE great Mr Scott)did a great job (the action scenes are great and also the flash backs); good plot; Russel is the perfect heroe : a man tormented by the death of his Joaquin family trying to avange  them, in the oposite corner is Phoenix the &quot;vilan&quot; who is fourious by the chose of his father to give the power of the empire to a a general; one of the best soundtrack i had ever heard; and excelent psecial efects: I really recomend it.	4.0	THE film of the year 2000	2001-06-28	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A30L67CSB98SAN	Miguel Aguilar	I rented the early released copies of Gladiator and Braveheart on Blu-ray from my local video store and while Braveheart received top notch treatment in its transfer to Blu-ray, Gladiator did not. It looks like the studio applied a bit too much processing to the film. The film looks a tad bit to bright at times. Also, I immediately noticed very visible halos around the heads of the actors and edges of buildings in the film, indicating that the studio used a bit too much digital sharpening, i.e. edge enhancement, to make the picture look sharper than it probably was in the first place. I further noticed flashes of unnatural color here and there in the film. If there is an upside to the HD transfer of Gladiator it is the HD audio which is very good. Gladiator is a film deserving of a dynamic visual presentation in High Definition. It is a shame the studio did not produce a beautiful transfer, like they did for Braveheart, being that Gladiator is such a great film. It deserves better than this release. I would seriously recommend you rent this version of Gladiator before you decide to buy it.	2.0	Gladiator Blu-ray	2009-08-31	29	26	3
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A182CY2NWMR6XT	"Miguel ""Writer, Journalist, Film Critic"""	This film is probably the best blockbuster of the summer. It has grisly and rousing action, wonderful technical direction from Ridley Scott, and masterful performances from Crowe and Pheonix.Flaws always first. The opening battle sequence is confusing, and tries to be chaotic, when it is just incoherent. However, the rest of the film justifies Scott's technical brilliance (more on that later). The screenplay isn't as much a story told with action sequences but a string of action sequences with some connecting thread. However, it allows for some great acting. The script introduces a startling relationship between Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix) and his sister Lucilla (Connie Nelson), giving Pheonix and added dimension to chew through.And does he ever. One of his three films this year, Pheonix proves that he can act in several diverse roles. This will probably garner him on Oscar nomination. His snivelling, ambitious emperor provides a fine foil for Crowe's Maximus. Crowe finally cements his star status with this film, after amazing turns in The Insider and L.A. Confidential. His performance is brutal and intense. In fact, the screenplay spares nothing on his character, giving Crowe several powerful scenes (the climax, his prison conversation with Lucilla, and his earlier conversation with Marcus Aurelius). He'll probably get an oscar nod as well.Now, the direction of Ridley Scott. I am a huge fan of his, so I was pleased to see him handle both the technical and narrative direction with equal aptitude. His technical direction is superb, ranking with Blade Runner, Legend and Alien. For the balance, he has paid attention to the story (as in Thelma and Louise and Someone to Watch over Me). And it has paid off handsomely. Look for Gladiator to have the most nominations at the academy awards this year	5.0	Old fashioned blockbuster... you may gape at it!	2001-01-01	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1JMQ88IMH0XJL	Mike	"""Gladiator"" (2000)What more could you ask of Gladiator? It's crowd-pleasing, entertaining, its got Russell Crowe, CGI tigers, swords, lots and lots of action and a suitable running time for a battle epic. I enjoyed Gladiator even since it came out. I thought it was clever and enthralling entertainment that kept me captivated with its ferocious and heartfelt story.On the subject of the story, Gladiator really does have a lot going for it. It may not look a lot on the outside, but look for Gladiator's interior and you will see there is actually quite a lot going on the film. The big picture of course is the story about ol' Maximus (Crowe) becoming a gladiator and defying an empire. However the movie also has some excellent sub-plots which bring across the messages of family love, revenge, jealousy, history, friendship, death, war and terrific conquests. I was constantly surprised at how much I was learning from Gladiator, even if it did have some historical inaccuracies.To bring to life all these stories we needed a great director, someone who used his/her vision to bring such a highly anticipated cinema event to life. Thank God for Ridley Scott. Scott puts all his heart and soul into the film and it finally emerges as one of his most enjoyable and entertaining and overall best achievements to date. Scott uses every ounce of his filmmaking passion and incredibly he makes this movie look, feel and seem every inch like a gladiators stadium.Scott's cast also does extremely well in delivering the goods. Heading, of course, is New Zealand's own Russell Crowe, who has never faulted yet. Crowe brings such a manly, strong and enjoyable hero to watch you literally have to choke back the urge to cheer for his character. Joaquin Phoenix is the villain in the film, he brings an eerie screen presence, and he is finally matching up to the standards of his late brother, River. Connie Neilsen is the main lady in the film, and struts through the movie with a great elegance. Neilsen carries herself excellently, and she proves that she can do better than just an extended cameo (The Devil's Advocate). Oliver Reed is also particularly enjoyable, as is Amistad's Djimoun Hounson, and Richard Harris is perfect in the very small but largely important role of Marcus Aurelius.The movie looks great, too. The battle scenes are gory and the incredible sound techniques used in them are eye widening. The costumes are beautiful and have a lot of range, Janty Yates did do a good job, but the armour and most of the costume designs weren't actually made in the times when this film is set. Never mind, they look good and suit the cast, and at the end of the day that's what matters. The CGI and effects are like nothing you'll probably see throughout 2000 - you cannot even tell these are special effects. I almost thought that Scott had got his team to build a coliseum and make Russell Crowe fight real tigers. Stunning!The length and pace of the film suited me fine. Even though it is over 2 hours, Gladiator actually never really bored me or had me uninterested, so I was fine with the couple of hours well spent in the cinema.I really liked the way the movie begun and ended. The beginning really proves a man's hand gliding across grass can lead to a lot of different points in a film, and the ending almost had me in tears. This movie is very well done and never goes over the boat with cheesiness. I guess that's exactly why I felt so much for the characters and never found myself sighing or rolling my eyes when the dramatic scenes were on.Gladiator is a film you'll love or hate. I loved it a lot, it's a movie that has the power to entertain you with action, stun you with thrills, take your breath away with some amazing atmospheric special effect places, and definitely make you feel a lot for the people in the movie. I highly recommend this to not only action gurus and Russell Crowe fans, but I think everyone will find something they like in Gladiator.MY GRADE: A"	5.0	A stunning epic.	2002-04-08	1	0	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1F6EN9CE0QUYI	Mike	I give it 5 stars because I do like the film. And Russel Crowe is a good actor, but is he really the star everyone is gushing over.  Really look at it objectively, Crowe dosen't really have that much dialogue. Just a bunch of well acted fighting, and in the end it's over for him as well as Commodus.  Joaquin Phoenix on the other hand has tons of drama.  Some powerfull scenes with his &quot;father&quot;, good long scenes with his &quot;sister&quot;, really show what a coward Commodus was.  I thought this was great acting, even though Crowe is the listed star, In my opinion, it's Phoenix's character that really draws out some fine drama, and powerfull acting.	5.0	Another Perspective	2000-10-07	1	1	0

Right from the start there is violence.  This movie is definitely not for children.  If you can stomach the gore, give it a chance.  It is a great story starring Russell Crowe, the premier hero, and Joaquin Phoenix, the main villain.  When you see what happens to our protagonist's family, what he loves most, you will be intensely wishing for justice.  And justice is served, however bittersweet it may be.  This is the best movie involving the Roman Empire that I have ever seen.	5.0	A Good Man Seeks Vengeance	2006-09-21	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A27PSZX2SE0B51	Mike Stone	"There's a series of scenes about halfway through ""Gladiator"", when you realize the filmmakers have pulled off a neat trick.  Commodus has reinstated the gladiatorial matches at the Colosseum.  Proximo, a slave-owner gives this advice to Maximus, a gladiator intended for the ring of battle: ""I was the best because the crowd loved me; win the crowd and you will win your freedom.""  He's talking of the power of spectacle, as a means to an end (i.e., Maximus' freedom).  It is easy to see how this applied to not only the Gladiators of ancient Rome, but its politicians as well; Commodus is desperate for the love of the people (a.k.a. the vulgar mob) and the spectacle of combat shall bring that to him.  Taking this strain of logic further, it most definitely applies to politics in contemporary society.  Witness the ""style-over-substance"" approach of modern political campaigning.  But nowhere does spectacle reign supreme more than... Hollywood blockbuster movies!  Of which ""Gladiator"" is most definitely one.  Neat trick, no?  Kind of a gutsy move, biting the hand that feeds and feeds and feeds you.So how do we judge this movie as spectacle?  Pretty good, I'd say.  From the opening bloodbath in Germania (""Unleash Hell,"" Maximus says, coolly), to the multiple battles in the Colosseum, director Ridley Scott handles the action with great style.  The sheer size of these battles is impressive enough, and the action does its very best to measure up.  If you are a fan of watching appendages sliced from bodies, or ever wondered what sound a sword would make when plunged into the torso of a Roman, then you won't be disappointed.  And except for a dubious decision by one of the characters that sets up the film's climax, the story was handled well.  Sure, it aims for Shakespearean and misses.  But what summer blockbuster even gets this close to the Bard?  It's a poor man's mixture of `Julius Caesar', `Antony and Cleopatra', and even `Hamlet'.Ridley Scott seems to have taken a cue from Jerry Bruckheimer (who's produced five movies directed by brother Tony), by casting a boatload of quality actors to read from a script who's main function is to quickly deliver the audience to another action sequence.  All of the actors make the best of what they're given.  Joaquin Phoneix as Emperor Commodus is suitably creepy, whether he's visibly lusting after his father's power or his sister's body.  Richard Harris as said father is majestic as the dying Marcus Aurelius.  Connie Nielsen as said sister is cunning and thoughtful as the daughter who, if she'd have been born a son, would have made a fine leader.  Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, and even Derek Jacobi show up in small, but pivotal roles, lending authority to the proceedings.But there would be no spectacle, no ""Gladiator"", with out Russell Crowe.  I am ever amazed at the amount of visceral intensity this man burns on screen.  I tried to picture someone else in this role, but couldn't.  Who has his combination of physical power and grace, charisma, and quiet dignity?  I wouldn't have been surprised if the filmmakers had mounted the Colosseum itself on his sturdy shoulders, in one last fit of Apollo-like spectacle.  It would definitely be a fitting end to a fine piece of entertainment such as this."	4.0	Spectacular	2001-01-05	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3EIILPV6LMY0K	Mike T.	You are not going to learn a lot about history by watching this movie but I found it very entertaining.  Unlike one of the other reviews, I thought it had a great ending.  Obviously I will not go into details and spoil it but I thought it was very fitting.Some parts are predictable and far-fetched and this is a very violent movie.  I put it in the same class as Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan which were both great movies.  If these movies offended you I would suggest not watching this one.While watching this movie I tried to imagine what it must have been like to be alive in that era.  Walking into the arena not knowing what or who you would be facing with a very likely chance that you would not be walking out is very erie....	5.0	Not the history channel but a great movie	2001-01-01	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AUSATFDSU2INS	"milss ""Yellow hair warrior"""	A Caesar with little common sense wouldn't have a choice. Gladiator deserves the approved sign not with one, but with two thumbs up.With state-of-the-art digital technology, the Roman epic of director Ridley Scott brings us the return of the glorious city that was Rome. It had never shone so densely opulent; so outlandishly declining.On the verge of dying, Emperor Marcus Aurelius makes the decision to name Maximus, general of his army, his successor, with the hope that he will protect Rome and give back the power to the people. But his ambitious son, decided not to fulfill his father's will, will untie a chain of events that will change the future of the Roman Empire. Maximus will have to survive the jealous wrath of Commodus, the murder of his family and the infamy of being enslaved. But as a gladiator he will find the way to serve Rome and to fulfill the promise done to the late Marcus Aurelius.The epic cinema returned big. Reliving all the pomp and ceremony of old civilizations, Gladiator will dazzle you with extraordinary battles, realistic scenes of fight and admirable views of England, Malta, Italy and Morocco.Russell Crowe is a magnificent gladiator; a combination of brain, muscles and a noble soul, that places him in the same rank of Kirk Douglas's Spartacus or Charlton Heston's Ben Hur. His Maximus is a hero in all the extension of the word, virtuous, genuine, charismatic and very, very human.The rest of the cast is magnificent, from the selection of Joaquim Phoenix as the despicable Commodus, whose resentments and jealousy are concrete, to Richard Harris in its small but impressive Marcus Aurelius.Under the skillful direction of Ridley Scott - who brings out the best from the script supported by a range of technological tools- Gladiator succeeds finding a perfect balance between action and emotion. Its main center is in the characters and in a history that captures the importance of our actions. Their protagonists emit vitality, in the battlefield, in the bloody sand and mainly, they convince us that it's worth to live or die by the values and ideals we have inside.	4.0	Colossal warrior, unparallel hero	2005-05-20	0	0	0

No complexity.She pretty much hit the nail on the head.  KAWHAP!I found this film to be good for its special effects and costumes and mediocre to above average in storyline.  The former for the costumes, wonderful renditions of the colosseum and city of Rome . . . but not so good story as there were a few plot holes.  I don't want to give anything away but look for these elements:(1) the opening battle scene (anticlimatic);(2) self absorbed Emperor Commodus who slowed down the pace of the story;(3) overly slow flashbacks and dreams;(4) atrocious Historical accuracy: there was an Emperor Commodus but he wasn't slain in the ring; one of his competitors had a wrestler slay him;(5) one word gets out that a Roman general is alive, his troops tended to march upon any city to free him.  This was typical in Roman History when the leader was well loved as Maximus was . . .woops! . .. of course, we never hear much about it.(6) If Commodus wanted to win the love of the people, there are better ways than matching swords with some ex general who hates your guts.The GOOD PARTS OF THE FILM WERE:(1) wonderful colosseum fights; kudos to the Battle of Carthage in the middle;(2) Russel Crowe did a great job (anyone notice how surprised he looked to have gotten best actor in the AA?);(3) wonderful cinematography of the city, colosseum, tigers and the seven hills of rome; the birds; the sunlight; etc(4) great and realistic looking costumes; believable extras; and(5) some pretty good backstory with the minor characters, as well as the main character.While I don't feel this deserved best film, Hollywood has always had a soft spot for big epic pieces (look at TITANIC).	3.0	3 1/2 stars; lots of style but not much substance	2001-03-30	20	13	7
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2TPPTGR4DIRL0	Mitch Clifford	"This movie was excellent. I went to the theater expecting a movie more in the line of ""The Patriot"". In other words, a good popcorn action/war flick, nothing special but still not a bad movie. What I found was a masterpiece. This movie blew me off my feet. The actors were perfectly casted. The storyline was excellent. The acting was some of the most memorable in many years. The special effects were amazing. The Cinematography was perfect. The battles were incredibly realistic and beleivable. Russell Crowe(Maximus) was perfect at playing his role; a Sad Hero. Throughout the movie you are made to believe that all he is trying to do is win his freedom. He has no ""save Rome"" attitude as I thought he would before I saw the movie. I thought he was going to be a ""Rebel"" trying to save the people. But what he is, is a man trying to win freedom and revenge against the man(who is the King's Son i.e. the Prince) who slaughtered his family and the king(who happened to be his best friend and the father he never had). By the end he finally wins his freedom.I wont ruin the surprise ending for you. I will say that it is deliciously ironic though."	4.0	Best movie of the year	2008-09-15	1	0	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A27RJ30RN5K9MX	Mitch Weaver	Maximus Decimus Meridias ( Russell Crow) is the general of the Roman army. Over the course of being general, Maximus has won many victories which has caused him to be loved by not only his soldiers, but the aging emperor Marcus Aurelius ( Richard Harris) as well. As time grows nearer towards the emperor's death, he names Maximus as his successor over his son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix)in a private conversation between Maximus and himself. When Commodus is told the news by his father, Commodus kills him in a fit of rage. In order to keep his father's last wishes hidden, he orders that Maximus and his family are to be killed so that he can become Rome's newest emperor. Maximus manages to escape before he can be killed, but loses his will to go on when he discovers his wife and son dead. He is captured by a slave trader named Proximo ( Oliver Reed) and forced to compete as a Gladiator until he is killed in battle. However, Maximus proves to be a worthy Gladiator, and soon wins the hearts of the crowds in the Colliseum. Maximus uses his desire for revenge to fuel his way towards gaining his revenge on Commodus.Ridley Scott's &quot;Gladiator&quot; is an amazing film. For 2 1/2 hours I was glued to the screen and loving every minute of it. Gladiator is the first film since Braveheart, that captivated me and left me speechless. Everything about this film was extremely well done. The story was extremely inspiring because of what Maximus is forced to go through. At times I was also somewhat amused by the story because it featured elements of the WWE and reminded me of the Stone Cold Steve Austin/ Vince McMahon feud. The more that Maximus rebelled against the system and defied the emperor Commodus, the more he was revered. The battle scenes in this film are unreal. They are so violent and realistic, that you wil be made to flinch at times. The musical score to this film was amazing. It was extremely powerful and moving. Each time that it played throughout the film, the intensity of the scene would increase. I also thought that Ridley Scott did an excellent job at recreating the Colliseum and ancient Rome in general. Everything from the actor's dialogue to the costume designs were dead on. Rusell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were both amazing in their roles and played extremely well off of each other. Their feud was extremely entertaining throughout the whole film. Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Connie Nielsen, and Djimon Hounsou were all fantastic in their roles as well.Overall, Gladiator is a great film. The story is inspiring, all the actors involved did a great job, the musical score was very powerful, and the film effectively recreated ancient Rome. The 2 disc DVD set is great on its own. The first disc features the film and offers outstanding picture and sound quality. If you have surround sound, you will love watching this film when using it. The second disc contains nothing but extras that include 25 minutes of deleted scenes, featurettes, an interview with Hans Zimmer on the making of the musical score, and more.A solid 5 stars...	5.0	Thank you Ridley Scott!!!	2004-03-11	1	1	0

After escaping captivity, Maximus joins the Gladiators of Rome, and becomes an undefeated champion, awaiting his revenge upon the Emperor, for the murder of his family.MY REVIEW:&quot;This movie is powerful and emotional, is action packed, and is a true epic with great story telling. Russell Crowe earned his BEST ACTOR oscar well. This is a real career turn-around for him. GLADIATOR won BEST PICTURE of 2000, and it deserves it! The movie has great special effects (which it won an Academy Award for)and marvelous battles! The music is the best part! Hans Zimmer is top notch at his music which really sets the tone for this film! This movie deserves far more than all five stars! See GLADIATOR, as being the BEST MOVIE of 2000!

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"Ridley Scott is one of the most visually prolific directors ever.  His films ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" alone are testaments to his talents, though the Roman epic ""Gladiator"" is one of his best, resurrecting Rome but at the same time delivering a classic Shakesperian story ripe with feeling and authenticity.  He employs an extraordinary cast, which include Russel Crowe who won an Academy Award for his portrayal as the fallen general Maximus.  Not to mention Joaquoin Phoenix is creepy and sullen as the coniving Commadus and the late Oliver Reed and Richard Harris are wonderfully animated in their respective roles as Proximo and Marcus Aruelius.  And Connie Nielson is effective as Commadus' sister, who is terrified of mourning her slain father for her fear of her unstable brother.""Gladiator"" starts off with a bang as the Roman Legions battle Germanic hoardes in the forests of Southern Germany.  It is spectacularily staged, with the stoic Russel Crowe (Maximus) leading the charge and hacking away at opposing fighters.  After the fight,  Maximus learns from the ailing Emperor Marcus Aruelius (Harris) that he is be the Emperors' heir, and not the Emperor's son, Commadus (Phoenix).  Commadus goes berserk and Maximus is forced to flee and he finds his family back home dead.  In despair, he wanders aimlessly collasping in an open plain and picked up by a group of Gladiator recruiters, led by a former Gladiator named Proximo (Reed).  From there, Maximus is a Gladiator fighting in pest-infested arenas, waiting for his chance to return to Rome and Commadus.Even though big-budgets are routinely given out these days, ""Gladiator"" lives up to its epic title by being granted a $100 million-plus budget, and it shows.  The special effects are mega-sized, resurrecting the landmark Roman Coliseium  in all its glory.  When the gladiators enter to 50,000 screaming Romans, one cannot help but be in awe.  The visuals are not limited to computers though.  The costume and set designs are exquisitely detailed, down to the last thread of silk on Connie Nielsons' gowns.  ""Gladiator"" looks, smells and feels like ancient Rome.Some people say that this movie is no more than overblown spectacle, devoid of a story worth following and empty acting all-around.  Now, everyone is entitled to their own opinion (with the internet you can just about read everyone's anyway) but I see ""Gladiator"" as a triumph as a modern-day epic.  It brims with equal parts visual splendor and genuine emotion, carried by restrained but stylistic direction and wondrous acting.  It succeeds at being both a feast for the eyes and as grand storytelling.  When Maximus bellows ""Are you not entertained?!,"" I will respond with a resounding ""Yes."""	5.0	A Visual, and Emotional, Triumph	2003-06-30	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1KAR9G699RM56	M. Miller	"Gladiator was the first in a series of recent successful Russell Crowe movies, and I think he started on not so bad a foot.  The plot is centered on a general (Russell Crowe) who is loved by all, until the emperor's crazed son gets wind that Crowe is supposed to takeover instead of himself.  As all jealous based plots go, Crowe is sent away and stripped of his old life.  This is much like Dante in Monte Cristo, except for the fact that Crowe becomes a gladiator instead and has to find himself and ""old Rome"" through the games instead of a prison cell.  It is an okay movie overall, but really the only things that made this movie interesting to me were the gladiatorial games themselves.  I feel that the dialogue and basic plot overall is lacking, but I understand that the basic plot highlights the action, and therefore not meant to stand up to much criticism in the first place.  Historically it is off too, but not everyone cares about that kind of thing these days, but if you do be warned.  I would say this movie is worth a rental, and maybe on a personal level you will find it more exciting than me, but I would not just go off and buy it."	3.0	Film of the actions, not the pages	2004-04-15	3	2	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3I50GSQRG58MH	M. Montesa	I've always been a fan of the 'sword and sandal' epics of the '60s (Ben Hur, Spartacus, etc) and I was thrilled to see the genre brought up to date with 'Gladiator'. I don't think Gladiator can fairly be compared to the old classics though, as some have done; different directing methods, cinematography, and other aspects make it difficult.'Gladiator' is an outstanding film in its own right. The visuals go a long way towards giving us some idea of what ancient Rome really looked like; I especially revelled in the overhead shots of the city and the Coliseum. The set pieces, the battle in Germania, all the fights in the arena are extremely well done and realistic. The attention to detail was amazing.But the thng that makes the movie shine is Russell Crowe's portrayal of a man who has lost everything, and will risk all that he has left, for revenge. A simple story really, but Crowe as Maximus gives the character a lot of depth and I found his character inspiring. Leaders like Maximus are few and far between, and not always appreciated by those they serve. A man like Maximus inspires others to great things and helps raise them up. I'd follow him to hell and back!The other supporting cast is also great. Joaquin Phoenix does a fine job as the evil Commodus. Sure, Commodus a lunatic, but in the opening scenes with Emperor Claudius, at least you can see where he's coming from. Oliver Reed is great in his last performance, and the actor who plays Maximus' African friend (can't recall his name) ads a poignant touch (I especially liked his last scene in the Coliseum at the end, when he buries the dolls of Maximus' family in the earth of the Coliseum).Scenes like that, and others; the scenes with Maximus walking through the wheatfields, the German barbarians screaming their defiance, Maximus and his men refusing to die in the arena, make this movie a real blockbuster.	5.0	Well hard!	2000-09-21	8	7	1

Maybe my head has been in the sand, but I didn't really know who Russell Crowe was (excluding his romance with Meg Ryan) but now find myself a true fan.  His acting is extraordinary and the story line allows us to look a little bit into the past.  I never liked history in high school but find myself more interested in it as movies come out which tell a little bit about the past (yes, I realize they are &quot;Hollywoodized&quot; somewhat-I'm not that naive! :-)  ).More than the movie, the bonus material is fantastic.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AKUSIO6C5EAK4	"Mr. A. P. Venables ""andi02"""	I don't think Gladiator is a great film. Oh it looks wonderful, the fight scenes are great but, and I know it's not just me who thinks this, the whole enterprise isn't very involving. I left the film feeling nothing.The problem is the hero. As a general he hacks and slices barbarians. Through misfortune he is made a slave and he hacks and slices through gladiatorial games. There is no reason to like the guy and the idea that he wants to join his family in the after life doesn't hold much water.What is worse is the fact that is glorifies ancient Rome. You get the sense that film makers believe that the Roman Empire was a noble enterprise. Never do you get the sense that, like in Unforgiven, that the killing is needless or that the hero is in fact as bad as the people he's killing. I wasn't enjoying the film because I was never convinced that the heroes task was either justified or compelling.However, this is a Ridley Scott film and of course it's very well made. The fights are great and all the acting is fine.Epics like Braveheart, and Spartacus were about freedom. Maybe it's just me but Gladiator is a hollow experience by comparison.	3.0	I didn't like it.	2002-07-02	1	0	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	Every summer there's at least one blockbuster movie.  Usually it's a complete no-brainer, but 'Gladiator' proved otherwise.  The premise is basic as Maximus (Crowe) battles his way through the gladitorial arenas to win his freedom and avenge the deaths of his wife and son.  Ridley Scott is one of those directors that every so often really hits the big time with his movies such as 'Alien' and 'Thelma And Louise', and 'Gladiator' is one such movie.  It manages to drag up the old gladiator epic and breathe new life into it without resorting to camp.  Using state of the art computer graphics you'll believe that you're actually seeing ancient Rome and this is definitely a highly cinematic film that loses something on video.The acting is fantastic as well.  This burst Russell Crowe into the big league, something that anyone who had previously watched 'The Insider' or 'LA Confidential' already knew to be inevitable.  As loner Maximus he is perfectly cast and manages to bring to his character what is perhaps left out in the script.  As the villainous emperor, Joaquin Phoenix is genuinely creepy and actually quite unconventional as well.  The emperor's sister Lucille is also played with vigour by Connie Nielson and Oliver Reed turns in a last performance as a gladiator owner.Unfortunately 'Gladiator' does tend to modernise the premise, with a few politically correct characters thrown in as an afterthough.  Over anything else this is a blockbuster and as such can't be viewed as anything truly revelatory.  Yet viewed simply as a movie it is a stunning breakthrough: utterly breathtaking and compelling in equal measure.	5.0	A real epic	2002-02-28	1	0	1

At over two hours (it only seemed like six and a half), this landmark in cinematic ennui poses only one threat greater than having to watch it: having to watch it again. When Maximus' family is slaughtered in the first 35 minutes, you know that he's not going to be around at the closing credits. And the viewer's mood parallels Maximus' throughout the movie: there's agony and despair all along the way with doom at the payoff. The first twenty minutes of this film earn it its one star. The opening battle scenes are truly thrilling, but only serve to highlight the stupefyingly boring nature of the remaining two hours. If your aim is to overcome a massive case of insomnia, run to see ""Gladiator."" If entertainment is what you crave, run faster, but run away from this tedious time-waster.

The Majesticness of the Roman empire was captured nicely and the power of it's people and culture were also well rendered.Bottom line?  This was a somewhat sad movie which was surprising as the title and concept had me figuring it was gong to be a rough & tough action movie.  Sure, there was a lot of action and bloody fighting but the undertones of the film were mainly sadness, despair, and ultimately revenge.  The main character goes through what can only be described as hell on earth from an emotional standpoint.  I mean.... geeesh...how could he take all those things that happened to him and his loved ones and not go completely crazy?Russell Crowe did a nice job as the under-spoken Gladiator and his nemesis was the perfect ""spoiled brat"" heir to the throne type that you want to immediately choke to death.

I purchased the DVD the day of its release ages ago and am contemplating purchasing a Blue Ray player and this would defiantly be one of the first movies I purchase.Well, my brother happens to be a big fan of this movie as well and has a Blue Ray player.  So he invited me over so we can catch up and watch this movie on Blue Ray.  I could not tell that this was on Blue Ray.  In fact, I thought it was even worse than the DVD I have at home.  The extended parts that were included were pretty cool, but I was definitely expecting more from Blue Ray.  My brother threw in another movie afterwards to ensure me that it was just the movie, and not Blue Ray in general, and I was blown away by the quality of Sin City on Blue Ray.  So I still will give in to the Blue Ray, but not this movie.Here I am checking out what other people think of Gladiator in Blue Ray and it looks like everyone is in agreement that it was created rather poorly.  Can this be redone?  I would definitely purchase this movie, but I already have it on DVD, so work that Blue Ray Magic!	1.0	I was sure i was watching a DVD by accident	2009-09-03	21	12	9

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3HA0A92FVYHOF	"Mr. Tickle Snort ""Mr. Ticklesnort"""	"More recently, the critics took aim and fired collectively at Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor.  One of the criticisms was the film's (alleged) lack of attention to historical fact.  Indeed, Michael Bay took some liberties with Pearl Harbor.  He altered history.With Gladiator, history was not altered, but put through a  paper shredder and completely re-written.  Early in the film, the audience is asked to go along with the most ludicrous of propositions.  It goes like this.Caesar, (played by Richard Harris) is weary of war and conquest.  He would like to die knowing that Rome will be reformed.  Thus, he makes known his desire to make Marcus Aurelius, (played by Russell Crowe) the new Emperor.  He would rather have a soldier be Emporer than his own son.  Why?  Because he wants to give power ""back to the people.""Anyone who knows anything about Roman history ought to be ashamed for swallowing this whopper.  The real Caesar didn't give a rat's behind about giving power to the people.  One has to get past this ludicrous idea from the get go, or spend the rest of the movie scratching his head.And the battle scenes?  Well they  are so obviously computer animated,  I felt l as though I was watching  Rogger Rabbit vs. Ben Hur.And what's more, the basic plot seems stolen straight from the Mad Max movies and placed in an Acient Roman setting.  The hero's family is murdered, and so our hero must rise up against seemingly unstoppable forces to get revenge.  Sound familiar?I can agree that Russell Crowe is a fine actor, as are the other players in this film.  But I don't understand how that  excuses all of the other flaws.Even still, lots of folks out there liked it, so I guess its just a matter of taste.

In this movie, he brings the fanatic and edge of your seat excitement that Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart had to the epic roman battles.  This film had it all, from a great cast to wonderful cinematography and editing.  The only fault I could find was the somewhat anti-climactic ending, but I heard that it was due to some storm that destroyed the sets for the grand epic battle.  I wonder if they will shed more light on that subject, but still it was a great movie.  It made a star out of Russell Crowe, a great actor who has been in some very good movies, among my favorite, is LA Confidential.The special edition DVD is defiantly worth a look at, I can't wait to buy it!	5.0	Ridley Scott does it again!	2000-10-03	1	1	0

The award-winning actor Russell Crowe plays the leading role in this movie as Maximus, a Roman general turned gladiator.  With a 2 hour and 35 minute run time, this movie does not leave you wanting for adventure.Maximus wants nothing more from life than to return to his family and take up farming again.  A friend to the people of Rome, as well as the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, he is unable to return to the life he had previously led and due to his fame, and the jealousy of that fame, the antagonist Commodus (played by Joaquin Phoenix) attempts to have him and his family killed.  It is after the murder of his wife and son that Maximus vows to get his revenge. It is also at this point that the action intensifies making the movie the Award Winning picture that it became.The intense, fast paced gladiator battles set the stage, while the emotional struggle of the players set the backdrop.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3VY5UA24EZT72	Nathan Dickey	Gladiator is Ridley Scott's very successful attempt at portraying the life of of a gladiator. It is definitely one of my top ten favorite films, because of its excellent character development, excellent storyline, and excellent portrayal of the time period and of the life gladiators lived.Gladiator is the story of a Roman general who, in the beginning of the film, is leading his army of soldiers against a stronghold. It is the last stronghold they must take over before they achieve total victory in the war. Maximus (Russell Crowe) who is the Roman general survives the battle, leading his forces to victory. The emperor, Marcus Aurelius, who presides over the battle commends Maximus for his abilities as a general. A little later on he chooses Maximus to succeed him as emperor instead of his son (Joaquin Phoenix). When he learns that his father has chosen Maximus instead of him to succeed as emperor, he kills his father, then tells the people he died of natural causes. When Maximus refuses to acknowledge him as emperor, he orders Maximus to be killed. Maximus narrowly escapes from the executioners with his life and makes his way to his homeland, where he finds that his wife and small son have been murdered by the new emperor's agents.He is then captured by citizens of Zucchabar and taken to Zucchabar to be sold as a slave he, along with several other slaves, is purchased and forced to live the life of an arena gladiator.The rest of the movie portrays Maximus the gladiator struggling to stay alive as he battles professional fighters, barbarian hordes, and tigers, determined to win his freedom. The film's climax comes when Maximus battles against the emperor himself . . .Gladiator is a film which should not be missed by anyone. The excellent character development, plot construction, and choreography makes it one of the best films ever made (in my opinion). 5 stars	5.0	One of My Top 10 Favorite Movies Ever!	2003-05-10	0	0	0

The reviews were uniformly good, friends who had seen it rated it a solid thumbs up, and I'm a huge Russell Crowe fan, so I settled in with my popcorn, ready to enjoy.And . . . I liked it.  I didn't love it.  Visually, it's a very striking film, although at times Ridley Scott lays on the effects a little too thick.  The performances, most notably by Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, are good, although Connie Nielsen's presence in this otherwise male-dominated drama seems to be superfluous (her costumes are great, though).  But what keeps this in my mind from becoming the masterpiece some claim is the screenplay--or lack thereof.  Crowe said in an interview that they essentially started shooting with no script, and it shows.  The dialogue is often stilted, despite some good lines (&quot;At my signal, unleash hell&quot; is already a catch phrase of sorts), and the plot turns can be seen coming for miles.  As for the history, well, Hollywood's never been a fountain of accuracy, and they certainly aren't going to start with &quot;Gladiator.&quot;  Crowe looks tremendous in a breastplate and tunic, by the way.Many have put &quot;Gladiator&quot; on the same level as &quot;Braveheart&quot;.  I will too, but for a different reason--like &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot; is a very heavy-handed historical drama that came out in a kind of a down year for good films.  Not that &quot;Gladiator&quot; isn't entertaining--it is, most definitely--but it isn't Oscar-caliber filmmaking.  That doesn't mean it won't get some Oscar nods when the time comes, though.  Enjoy it, but don't elevate it to something it's not.	3.0	Maybe it was all the hype . . .	2000-11-24	1	0	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2AP6M97YCWTYW	nibblywolf	I read these reviews and see people talking about the gore factor. I was impressed by this movie that with the title it had and hollywood's obsession with gore just for the sake of gore that there wasn't more then there was.The big difference here to me was that they didn't mull over the bloody scenes and glorify them. But what really surprised me about this movie was the way it pulled me in and made me feel,mainly due to the very crafty way in which the scenes were composed, and of course, the talent of the main actor.Anyone remember how the first &quot;Mad Max&quot; movie made them feel? Small budget, big on emotion. Next came Road Warrior- bigger budget, less emotion, then they plopped down that feeble excuse Beyond Thunderdome- biggest budget, flat on emotion. What I'm trying to say here is that Gladiator and it's Director deserve a standing ovation just for being able to pull off a big budget film that still packs a heavy payload of emotion rather then just &quot;wowing&quot; you with a glossy package of special effects. It is well worth the 3 hours it takes to watch this movie.	4.0	Gladisawit	2000-10-29	10	7	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2887J6P8VPB5H	Nichomachus	A movie with stunning visuals and great action scenes. Does that really warrant all of the wet pants everyone seemed to have after watching this movie? By such a standard, 'Men In Black' could at least have scored a Best Supporting Actor. &quot;Epic&quot; it is not. The tendentious movie reviewers of this country are all about as laughable as Columbia Pictures' &quot;David Manning.&quot;Apart from the great effects and visuals, and well-planned arena scenes, the laughable factor is greatly increased by how seriously the movie takes itself to be. The most boring, two-dimensional dialogue keeps happening over and over. Whiny-pants Russell Crowe's monotonally incessant, &quot;I don't want to be a slave anymore,&quot; spiel is constantly shoved down our throats in lieu of any content; it is certainly no &quot;CINQUE MAKE FREE!&quot; Crowe's glottal delivery is strangely reminiscent of the manic-depressive Marvin the Paranoid Android from the 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.'The interaction between Crowe and the princess is so hammy one's fast-forward finger just begins to itch out of embarrassment. The loopy emperor-guy is so evil, and so pale you're thrilled when his purple-clad guard comes stomping in so that there is something interesting to watch. The incest line is supposed to be creepy, but all it does is help convince everyone that THIS CREEPY MO' IS GOING DOWN BLOODY-STYLE. If you want to see an exquisitely acted bad-guy, watch John Huston in 'Chinatown;' your skin will crawl.As is this review, the movie went on for far too long for the completely tragic, touching, and poignant (blandly inevitable) ending it produced. I'll let you in on a secret: Rome still bit the dust. The Germanic tribes that got housed in the first scenes ... they won in the end.	2.0	Unabridged Mediocrity	2001-08-12	9	3	6
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3VA0URSHXZB6T	Nick Chang	Director Ridley Scott triumphs again in this modern EPIC. I need not put more into this review than to simply say this is a great film. From the openning battle in Germania to the final dual between Maximus(Crowe) and Commodus(Phoenix) in the Coliseum, this movie is an audio and visual feast on a grand scale.Like James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, and Wolfgang Peterson, Ridley Scott ranks as one of my favorite directors because these gentlemen all make high quality films. They are all visionaries who are masters of using modern visual effects to tell stories which have timeless themes. Gladiator is a perfect example.Other Ridley Scott films I recommend: ALIEN, Blade Runner, Black Rain.	5.0	Hail to Ridley Scott!  A Must Have DVD.	2000-11-27	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1TG7HEZZ1QH55	Nico Taudarian	With this film Russell Crowe cements his place amongst the elite of the world's top actors, a group he was on the verge on joining after stellar performances in LA Confidential and others. He plays the Roman general Maximus, a man of principle in an empire of corrupt politics, who falls afoul of the jealous new Emperor Commodus (a great Joaquin Phoenix) who kills his father Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) upon learning he plans to hand the Empire to Maximus.An attempt is made on Maximus' life but sadly the men sent to Maximus' family succeed in killing them. Whilst captured by slavers and sold into the arena, Maximus finds himself unable to let go and die, and victory after victory leads him back to Rome and closer to a revenge on the man who destroyed all he had. Director Ridley Scott is a sure hand on the tiller, delivering the years most magnificent spectacle. The multinational cast deliver superior performances, including a final swansong from Oliver Reed.In response to Tokyo-dude who found some things hard to swallow I would point out that he is in error for most of them. Maximus never witnessed Aurelius' death though he suspected Commodus of murder. He was arrested by Praetorians Commodus brought along, not his own troops, when he is about to be executed he addresses one as Praetorian. The Romans swore loyalty to Rome not their general, mutineers were routinely decimated (10% of them killed by drawing lots) by scourging and beheading, Maximus' own troops would have known this risk. Maximus' family were in Spain not central Italy and the terrain is the Massif Central in France and The Pyrenees. And the Praetorians assumed Maximus dead which is why the troops weren't waiting for Maximus to show up. Commodus was shocked to find Maximus still alive. It's the missing out of the sea-crossing to North Africa that left me puzzled but the film was so good it didn't spoil my enjoyment and nor should it spoil anyone else's.	5.0	Best film of 2000	2001-01-18	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1TWNOCUFHAQYB	"""nijhazer"""	Folks, they don't come any grander or any better than Ridley Scott's epic, Gladiator. This is without a doubt the best DVD I own, not only because the movie itself is outstanding, but because it's more jam-packed with fascinating extras than any other DVD I've seen-- only Disney's collectibles come close.What you're getting here is a two-disc set, one containing the nearly three-hour film (in widescreen with Dolby 5.1 and DTS audio tracks, plus English subtitles), and the other containing numerous Gladiator extras. You'll get some outstanding deleted scenes that, unlike some other films, add quite a bit to the Gladiator experience. You'll get a full filming journal written by one of the movie's stars throughout the course of the filming of Gladiator. You'll get a number of &quot;making-of&quot; featurettes-- one for the movie itself, one for the creation of the music, and more. You'll also get some sub-features about the continent on which Gladiator was filmed and the history of the Roman empire. In short, there's enough extra material here to bust a couple of togas, and it's of extraordinary quality.And then there's the movie itself. A better film than Gladiator I have not seen since 1994, the year of Braveheart-- a movie to which Gladiator can and rightfully should be compared. Both are epic in scope, both center on one man's quest for vengeance at the dawning of a new era, both are beautifully directed.... and both films contain some of the most outstanding battle scenes ever shot. Gladiator's opening battle is perhaps the best I have ever seen. Yet I won't say that one film is better than the other; they complement each other. Suffice it to say that if you liked Braveheart, you will like Gladiator.And regardless of what you like, you must have this DVD.	5.0	Gladiator absolutely defines &quot;must-own DVD&quot;.	2001-07-18	3	3	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2LOAZIOYP1T0T	nik	Respect Ridley Scott for what he has done with Gladiator. In revisiting an ancient civilisation, he has essentially regenerated the 'sword and sandals' epics of the 50s (Ben Hur, Spartacus in the 60s). Gladiator is astounding. The first ten minutes of the film are possibly the most awe-inspiring in any film (barring Star Wars), and this stream of adrenaline pumping action continues throughout the film. And the Tigers rock. And that's the good bit of the film.  The flawed aspect is the story itself, for although the idea of a vengeful Roman General fighting through gladiator 'school' and into the Colloseum is effective, and very cool, although not entirely original, it is when we are given this sub-plot of a secret Roman political conspiracy, and Maximus' role in disolving this conspiracy, that the film starts to slip a bit.The 'politics'of the screenplay detract from what we all want to see more of in this film-people getting chopped to bits. And that is what I think of the film. When it's good, it's the best action 'done in the old style' film in a long time, but when it starts to believe it has a well crafted, engaging story, it just becomes rather too Hollywood.	4.0	Staggering, flawed film	2000-10-13	1	0	1

But after the first battle scene, I kinda sat back and waited to see where they would go with it. Its very acurate at showing Rome at its peak, it has awesome fight/battle scenes, and shows that everything in the Gladiator games does inspire modern sports entertainment like pro wrestling. Russel Crowe displayed acting chops and sheer screen presance through out the film, and doesn't appear to be to overly physicly developed for the time it takes place in. My only problem with the movie is that several key plot points seem to have been lifted right out of Braveheart. I dont want to spoil anything, but it just seems weak a movie has to take so much from something else to stand on its own.

Despite the graphic violence (I had to close my eyes on some parts), it was definitely an amazing movie. It was so beautifully filmed and acted. The characters seemed slightly odd to our standards. That just gave the feel that this really was more than one thousand years ago and almost a completely different world. Even though the fighting was gory, it was always well choreographed. Russel Crowe did a fabulous job as a brave and honorable fighter (he's awesome!), as did everyone. I definitely suggest this movie, despite the bloodiness (if that's a word).

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A33TBHM3O9AY17	No one of consequence	"Russell Crowe is well-cast and in excellent form as the Roman legionnaire general Maximus, a well-loved hero of Rome and devoted servant of the aging Marcus Aurelius.  Maximus is not only a great commander, but is loved and respected by his soldiers, and deeply trusted by Aurelius.  As his death draws near, Aurelius entrusts the fate of Rome to the reluctant Maximus, precisely because he does not want the task.  Maximus has no ambitions for power -- he wants only to return to his home and family after years of hard campaigning.The emperor's son and heir, Commodus, however, is not pleased that Aurelius has robbed him of the throne by asking Maximus to restore the republic rather than perpetuate imperial power.  After Aurelius is dead, Commodus quickly moves against Maximus, who refuses to support his claim to be the new emperor.  Commodus' plot to kill Maximus fails (of course, or we wouldn't have much of a movie), but Commodus doesn't know that.  He does, however, succeed in brutally murdering Maximus' family, thereby sparking the unquenchable fires of revenge.  Maximus is enslaved by a former gladiator turned entertainer, Proximo, and forced to become a gladiator himself.  Maximus quickly distinguishes himself in the arena under the moniker ""The Spaniard"".Thus Maximus unwittingly is launched on a collision course with the emperor himself, as he is brought to Rome to compete in the Coliseum.  When his true identity is revealed, he finds that the adoration of the people enables him to defy the will of the emperor.  Maximus, then, is the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor.  Throughout this narrative, the noble, pious character of Maximus is starkly contrasted with that of the ruthless, perverse, self-serving Commodus.  Although the ending takes some liberties with history, it is nevertheless a quite fitting conclusion to what is essentially a morality play.  The cinematography is of the highest quality, and the gritty, gory action sequences create a strikingly realistic look back to the days of ancient Rome.  Well done!"	4.0	A visually stunning object lesson in true nobility.	2006-10-02	7	5	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3HEOREMM29XWV	"""novicaine19"""	Actually, I would like to give this movie a negative star rating. Ridley Scott basically raped the Roman Empire and put a modern socio-political spin on a time when there weren't even free elections. Seeing Maximus throw down his sword and shout, &quot;Are you not entertained?&quot; at spectators of a gladiator fight had me screaming, &quot;Die next time!&quot; Of course, Maximus had to be the adult, white male, accepting of all other colors, creeds, and genders (and he loves those innocent little kids). Good stuff, for today to be sure, but that's what makes this movie fiction and not historical fiction. It's odd that this happy, feel good concept is juxtaposed to a dark, gloomy back drop and morose faces on characters. Scott was clearly trying really hard to say something, maybe even something important, which makes this bad movie all the more embarassing.	1.0	to gag is not enough	2001-08-12	15	3	12

I have to say, however, that this movie was a brave attempt to make an epic like those of Hollywood's golden age.  Unfortunately it didn't work out and one of the main reasons for this is probably the arrogance of the filmmakers that literally distorted and changed the entire Roman history so it could fit in there movie, as if the history of the great Roman Empire was not interestig enough for hollywood. The worst of all is that Hollywood underestimated the audience's intelligence by filling the movie with frenetic scenes of battles and putting aside the real roman story(wich is much more intersting)as if the public could only be impressed by scenes in wich someone's head is cut off and not by the amazing history and legacy of the Roman Empire.	2.0	Hollywood's Roman Empire	2001-05-05	9	5	4

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A10ZE8HITPZ503	"oamaz ""oamazonka"""	Although it seems it's been the most reviewed movie of 2000, I can't refrain from saying a few words in its praise. If you're not blind or from Mars, you must have seen this epic &quot;how a general became a slave, the slave became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor&quot;.The movie has been compared to Ben Hur and Spartacus (from which it drastically differs, having in common only historical background and costumes; as Star Wars of 1977 differs from Phantom Menace 1999; it has been compared to Braveheart (the latter being much more steeped in patriotism and historical inaccuracy). It has also been blamed for being theatrical (and it is) and pathetic (oh, thumbs up), and illogical (indeed, flight to Spain over hundreds of kms to save his family and this abduction of Maximus by slave-traders are, well, unconvincing.Its success has been cemented by three ingredients: R Scott's director's genius and talent &quot;to create worlds&quot;, R Crowe's colossal charismatic performance that as magnet glues your eyes to screen whenever he's in frame and CGIs. However, so much has been dwelt on their grandeur in creating the world of the Ancient Rome, that I'll skip this part. All the CGIs prove once more that still (and thank God), movies are held together and brought to fame by actors. R Crowe fits in perfectly (imagine someone else in his place now? Impossible!), he's of the new actors whose talent comes from within - you can rewatch some scenes for a dozen times only to catch change of emotions on his face or expression of eyes (exhibit 1: Maximus scraping off Pretorian insignia from his shoulder - mixture of choked up pain, hatred and wry humor; exhibit 2: last conversation with Commodus - mixture of hatred, defiance and surprise and many others). Well, I like him so much I'd spare you and save the extra-space of this site. Watch for him, he'll get his Oscar if not this year, then the next.The supporting cast is harmonious as well: especially J Phoenix: although his Commodus is a capricious spiled brat, but watch his royal profile and gait, contempt in cold eyes and hidden fear. C Nielsen as his sister is not less ambitious and powerful, only in a more subtle way (I'd bet she was the one to jilt Maximus, not the other way round). The music is opera-suiting, sounds in your brain long after the movie is over.The finale is ... well, the best you can expect from Hollywood. Pathos is towering to heaven, but still sends shivers down your spine and mist into your eyes. I'd ask happy DVD owners: has there been any alternative ending in mind?To sum it up, although I'm a VERY BIG movie fan, it's the first movie EVER that I've watched for 4 times during last 1.5 months. It's a treasure for your home collection.PS: My greatest fear now is that R Crowe will squander his newly minted stardom and huge talent on some brain-dumb movie. Greatest hope - maybe someone will dare to revive Spartacus or come up with story of Alexander?	5.0	Magnificent!!! (although nothing is perfect)	2001-01-18	0	0	0

I'm game! and both versions are on one disc, I love both versions, so thats another bonus for this set.Paramount has done a great job with these Sapphire Series, I will be reviewing the Braveheart one and the Saving Private Ryan ones when I watch them, I've sampled them, and they look fantastic, but this one here is truly outstanding.Now if you buy the triple feature sapphire series set, you get all 3 movies said above, but you won't get the extras, and I'm a completist, so I bought all 3 seperatly, but still, these 3 movies on blu ray for about $25.00 for the set is still a great deal don't get me wrong, just no extras.I don't need to say much about the movie, fans of this film know truly how great of a film this is, so my focus was on the product itself, so if you are a fan of this movie, this edition is a MUST HAVE!, I'll still keep my DVDs of it of course, but this one will see the playing time!	5.0	One of the best movies ever gets a facelift!	2012-11-27	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z	Octavius	"""Hail Caesar! Those who are about to die salute you!"" And Ridley Scott's brilliant skills as a director certainly brought vivid imagery to the pageantries and spectacles of the Roman Empire. The film is more a historical fantasy epic as opposed to strictly a historical epic.  In addition to a fantasy context, the film is also plagued by various historical/anthropological errors.As a fantasy, the film's historical license makes the story historically absurd. It would be somewhat akin to having George Washington being an officer to a tyrannical George III and who flees from him after he's accused of plotting against the crown.  In the mean time, George III has Washington's entire family executed.  Washington finds refuge in the Americas and returns to London for revenge.  He fights George III mano-a-mano in front of a full Parliament and kills him.  Washington returns to the colonies and announces their independence.  Hurrah! And even that would be less of a stretch than this film's story.  Maximus is not a real figure but rather a composite of several Maximi. The film also makes it seem as if Commodus died in a short time after he began his reign which was not the case. Although Commodus did personally participate in gladiatorial spectacles, he was not killed in the arena but instead killed in his chambers 13 years into his reign.  Although the film's end leaves the question open whether the Republic was restored: it was not and the notion of republicanism in Rome at that time is equally erroneous.  In terms of a popular republican movement, the last time the Senate seriously contemplated restoring the Republic was upon the death of Nero over 120 years before. Such sentiments were long dead when Commodus ruled and people had become both dependent and accustomed to imperial despotism.  A well developed imperial bureaucracy provided many peoples with prominent positions and considerable influence to keep the imperial institution fixed as a permanent one. The scene with senators Gaius and Falco tempting Maximus with thoughts of a Republic within earshot of Commodus and Marcus Aurelius is therefore absurd.  Even the 'benevolent' Marcus Aurelius would probably have had them immediately executed for entertaining such dangerous ideas.In addition to factual errors, many of the sets and costumes were historically incorrect.  The unpaved dirt roads leading into Rome probably the most amusing. The battle was well done and most of the armor accurate except for the Praetorian guard who look more like they came from a galaxy far far away than from Imperial Rome.  The armor was over polished and the helmets completely out of place aesthetically.  The same is true for some of the scenes in the gladiatorial shows such as the crossbows which didn't exist at the time. Finally, Commodus' triumphal procession through the Sacra Via in a pitch black chariot with white blinding marble walls and statues everywhere is not an accurate depiction of what a Roman triumph would have been like.  Marble statues and reliefs were painted which would have made Rome a more colorful place than depicted in the film. The clothing and their colors don't reflect the fashion of that period at all either. The costumes and furnitures actually looked Napoleanic more than anything else. The soundtrack was the biggest disappointment. Although the incidental music was authentic, the wailing new-aged Persian singing for the main title was completely out-of-tune with the context of the movie: What were they thinking?  Is this a movie about Maximus or Mohammed? The music for the Commodus' procession was also such a cheap steal of Richard Wagner's ""The Ring"" trilogy they might as well have stuck to the original. Placing such divergent compisitions as the title track and the processionary one in the same film is more a cacophony than a symphony.  No creativity whatsoever in that department.Despite these draw backs,the acting by Crowe and Reed was decent.  Russel Crowe fit the role very well as a humble general (those were also very rare in Rome except perhaps for Lucullus and Belisarius.) An entertaining historical fantasy!  The star of the film is definitely J. Phoenix as the demented Commodus.  The combat scenes were a little too quick in sequence but certainly captured the mood of the fury and excitement the crowds expressed at these spectacles. Definitely worth owning."	4.0	AVE CAESAR MORITVRI TE SALVANT	2005-09-16	12	4	8

I'm not saying it's not good, but make no mistake, this  is no 'Ben Hur' or even 'Braveheart'.The 'epic scale' is more or less achieved, aided considerably by some  impressive Computer Graphics, and the action sequences are mostly  well done. However the storytelling could've been better ........  and in a strange way, the movie lacks soul. It doesn't really shake  you up when it supposedly should.Russell Crowe is competent as the chief protagonist, but his role is  not emotionally demanding. I believe he's given finer performances,  eg in 'Insider', without winning any awards so i guess it's some  kind of poetic justice that he must win it for this.Phoenix Joaquin is more impressive as the villain, even though his  character has no shades - he's just evil through and though.  Connie Nelson as his sister &amp; Crowe's ex love interest is fair.Most of the support cast do their job well.The technical aspects of the movie, like cinematography,  graphics, etc and the score all quite good.All in all, a movie worth watching, but you should do that first to  decide whether it's actually worth **buying**.	4.0	Good * Hype = Great ??	2001-08-09	3	2	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A15B5DO3A3A30C	Osher Doctorow, Ph.D.	Gladiator completely absorbed me with not a moment's lack of interest.  The beginning that starts in battle is the way human life starts - not born free but struggling and requiring courage and dedication and hard work to master and learn.  The film is in the tradition of the Count of Monte Cristo, Les Miserables with its human suffering, and Audie Murphy's story with its incredible courage in the face of the seemingly unconquerable odds.  It also gives a side of the Ancient Roman army that provides food for thought - it may well be that the army was more courageous than the politicians and their followers (does this seem to parallel modern times?) who misused it and sent it to fight their battles.  I also like the idea that you need to live in other people's shoes so to speak in order to understand them - the slavery of Rome looked very different when seen from the inside than from the outside.  The inconsistencies that some reviewers have noticed in the story seem to me less important than the consistencies and the similarities with our times.  I would have given this film the Academy Award, although I think that it would be better to give several awards for best motion picture.	5.0	Review of Gladiator	2001-04-03	4	2	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AFQ81K3X0NGEU	"PandtheB ""newhon"""	I have always loved gladiator films, and it has been a really long time since one came along, so when I found out they were making this particular film with Russell Crowe(sigh!) and directed by Ridley Scott who is always interesting and many times just a little bit bloody which is perfect for a gladiator film, I was thrilled to bits.  I had the opportunity to view this film on the big screen and then recently on DVD, and the contrast was informative.The battle scenes on the big screen seemed to me somewhat chaotic, a criticism that sometimes has me rubbing my forehead, because in a way it added a realism to the scenes; I am certain battle is much like that most times.  It did, however, take me out of the movie a little because it made me wonder if Ridley was getting too artsy-fartsy with it or if the guy in charge of editing was drinking way too much coffee.  I loved the ash falling like snow.  It added a sense of immediacy and realism that put me back into ancient Rome.  The computer graphics were breathtaking; clearly there was someone in charge who really cared about how ancient Rome really looked.As for the acting, as much as I love Russell Crowe who always does a good job, and as moved as I was with the knowlege that this was the last we would ever see of the late and talented bad-boy Oliver Reed, the performance that wowed me was Joachim Pheonix, in his almost perfect portrayal of Commodus, whose rule many scholars agree pretty much signaled the beginning of the end of the Roman Empire.  What a wonderful job Joachim did!  A true monster, terrifying and yet somehow sympathetic as well.  In fact, I personally believe he nearly stole the whole show.  Very talented actor.The story-line I found very touching.  It takes a fine hand to make tragedy appealing; to underscore the sadness in such a way that one feels they gained something in the telling of the story, instead of being dragged down by it, is a technique that in this case should be shared by the creator of the story(I'm sorry, I immediately lent it out to friends and so cannot check who that was), Ridley, and Russell.  Scott and Crowe show in this film what professionalism really is--the play's the thing, didn't Shakespeare once say?--and that is what both men focussed on.  What all of them focussed on, in fact.I've gone on too long.  I think you'll like Gladiator if you liked The Thirteenth Warrior or both Cleopatra movies(Elizabeth Taylor and the more recent one starring Billy Zane as Mark Anthony); also anyone who enjoyed the brilliant mini-series I, Claudius may enjoy this film.  Plus those of you who have read Colleen McCullough's incredible series of roman books, starting with The First Man in Rome to her most recent, Caesar, will most likely enjoy this movie as well.Ciao.	4.0	Ah, Rome!

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1D663YD036KNH	paperbackriter	You really get yor money's worth with &quot;Gladiator&quot;! This is a DVD lover's dream come true --- an epic movie loaded with tons of extras. First and foremost, this two-disc set features a beautiful widescreen print of one of the most visually stunning films in Hollywood's history. Director Ridley Scott and crew bring Ancient Rome to life in a grandiose fashion not seen since &quot;Ben Hur&quot;. The images are so crisp and 3-dimensional that it's hard to believe so much of this film is computer generated. The DTS sound really delivers. Crank it up during the intensely  thrilling Roman Coliseum battles. It's like being front-row and center as the heroic Maximus (Russell Crowe) slays both man and beast during some of the most riveting fight scenes ever filmed. Of course, all the visual effects in the world are worthless if the movie itself fails to deliver. No worry here. The tension between Maximus and Emperor Commodus (a wonderfully evil Joaquin Phoenix) carries &quot;Gladiator&quot; from beginning to bloody end. Phoenix is one of the creepiest bigscreen villains of all-time-- a snide, backstabing traitor. Crowe, however, is as heroic as Phoenix is evil. I guarantee you'll cheer Crowe's every move during their imminent showdown. It's a battle of pure bloody vengeance which, in terms of thrills, is unsurpassed.Just as satisfying as the film itself is the second disc which is packed with extras. Included are a &quot;making of&quot; mini-documentary, and a pair of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; featurettes which provide a lot of interesting insight. Director Scott provides an informative audio commentary which I found to be nearly as good as the movie itself. And if all this isn't enough, you get a ton of deleted scenes (complete with commentary) and a gallery of still photos from the set of &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Overall, this is a first-rate DVD. It's not often that a film of such epic proportions is packaged so well for the home theatre crowd. In fact, the extras alone are worth the price of admission. Highly recommended for action fans. Five stars all the way!	5.0	This DVD Delivers --- Epic Movie Loaded With Extras!!	2000-12-08	50	41	9
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1IYXWIF9XVY7K	"Part-Time Dreamer ""Dancing Pianist"""	Without any doubt, Gladiator was the best action film of all-time. It's amazing! The story of this movie was extraordinary. Maximus (Russell Crowe) had the ferocity of a warrior but with dignity and character. He combined the great feeling of heroism and bravery with goodness. Commodus, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius's son (Joaquin Phoenix) was a person with an insatiate thirst of human blood and capable of the most inhuman actions. His dislike about himself was reflected in his difficult personality. He was envious of Maximus because people loved him and above all because the Emperor loved Maximus mere than him. Although his wickedness, he suffered for this condition and, it causes into the public a sense of pity. The Emperor was an honest man and he fought for his people. He was never proud of his son and he paid for it with his live.This movie is the most realistic historical movie on Romans produced so far. The computer work on ancient Rome is beautiful and pretty much correct. The first 10 minutes (battle in Germania) are so real that you feel like you just did a time travel. The violence is cruel and disturbing, but that only adds to the realism of the movie.Of course, there are some amazing fight scenes as well, in the Coliseum and other gladiator venues as well as Germania, where we are introduced to Maximus putting down a barbarian rebellion. The combat scenes are where the CGI work and other special effects especially shine, with a fight between Maximus and his cohorts against a squad of charioteers making for one heady adrenaline rush.Ridley Scott is an absolutely talented director. He and a talented team of writers figured out a new way to breathe life in the old formula, with the help of CGI and a talented leading man. One of the best movies of Ridley Scotts since Alien and Blade Runner.Russell Crowe is more than adequate in the role of Maximus, he did a very decent job on his role and he does deserve the BEST ACTOR from those movies awards. Joaquin Phoenix also did a very outstanding job in his role. The acting of this movie was flawless and stunning.	5.0	Gladiator Rocks!	2006-04-03	9	6	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2RG88FJRTFCGR	Patrick Darms	"So far, I've never seen a more enthraling movie like ""Gladiator.""  I saw it when it came out, and I bought it as soon as it came out on DVD.The plot of ""Gladiator"" centers around Maximus (Russell Crowe), a decorated Roman general who wants only to go home, but the Emperor (Richard Harris) names Maximus his successor.  His immoral son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) gets jealous, kills his own father, and orders Maximus executed.  However, the good general escapes, only to be captured by slave traders and bred as a gladiator--a killing machine with a single purpose: to entertain the crowds of the Colosseum.""Gladiator"" is blessed with fine acting, photography, sets, and costumes--not to mention the bold score by the always fabulous Hans Zimmer.  Director Ridley Scott knows how to entertain, as he keeps the action scenes exciting but not too gory.  Even the slower parts are showered with tension, a true sign of a great drama.  Simply put, everyone should see this movie.  It's the best movie of 2000, and certainly worth of its five Oscars including Best Picture."	5.0	An instant classic	2002-10-06	3	0	3

Maximus, being a skilled fighter, escapes his killers and flees to warn his young wife and son, but he is too late - Commodus' troops have horribly slayed them.  Maximus weeps and blacks out.when he awakens he is a common slave.  his master forces him to become a gladiator, but then we find out that his masters may not be the cruel man we take him to be.  Maximus makes friends with the other gladiators and sets out on a personal quest to avange his murdered family.  he doesn't mind if he dies, because he will be with them.with beautiful directing, acting, cinematography, special effects, and costume design, &quot;Gladiator&quot; is truly a winner in all respects - forever destined to become a classic.	5.0	great historical film!	2001-10-18	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3C2Q9W6VN8EWL	P. Bartl	The DVD version of &quot;Gladiator&quot; is very good, especially the director's commentary on the deleted scenes (some of which would have made the movie better, and in my opinon should have been left in the final version).&quot;Gladiator&quot; is overall a fine film, with good actors, good dialogue, and a nice screenplay. The visual recreation of the Roman world of the 2nd century is thoroughly convincing and sometimes breathtaking, especially the opening battle sequence, which alone is worth buying the DVD for. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, as always, is excellent.Seen as the struggle of one man, Maximus (Russell Crowe), who falls from Roman general to gladiator and slave, the plot is quite strong and moving, apart from the many excellent action scenes.From the historical point of view, the movie is very flawed. Its starting point is a momentous event - the death of Emperor Marcus Aurelius and the accession of his unworthy son Commodus, which was seen by ancient and modern historians as the beginning of the empire's long decline. This same starting point had already been used in &quot;Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; in 1963, hence the similaraties between both movies, already noted elsewhere.But, while &quot;Fall&quot; did its best to remain at least partially faithful to historical events (getting ever less so towards the end), &quot;Gladiator&quot; uses the historical background but messes it up considerably.The main problems I have with &quot;Gladiator&quot;, historically, are:- the characterization of Commodus. The historical Commodus was a sports fanatic and a superb athlete, who wasn't too bad a gladiator himself. He was an eccentric tyrant, possibly even mad, and devoted himself to pleasure while his minions governed the empire - but he was a very different person from that portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, who's more of a &quot;problem kid&quot;. The real Commodus is not known to have incestuous designs on his sister Lucilla - he banished her to Capri and had her killed there afterwards, fairly early in this reign.- the idea that Marcus Aurelius might have thoughts about removing Commodus from the succession is probably wrong, but not too implausible. The idea that he might have planned to restore the Republic is preposterous. Any such attempt would almost certainly have plunged the empire into civil war, which is also why the historical Marcus actually did what he could to ensure that Commodus's position would be unassailable (since a rumor that Marcus had died 5 years earlier did indeed start a short-lived civil war), even though he was only 19 when Marcus died.- On this subject, someone says &quot;Rome was founded as a republic&quot;. No, it was founded as a monarchy ruled by kings; only some 250 years later did it become a republic - and some 480 years later an &quot;empire&quot;.- Maximus is portrayed as a &quot;general&quot; of the whole army in Germania, but who had never been in Rome. In Marcus's reign that would have been impossible - anyone in such a position would also have to belong to the senatorial class, and therefore have spent at least part of his career in Rome. &quot;Generals&quot; in the sense that Maximus was did not exist. However, people like Maximus did appears a few decades after Marcus's death.- Finally, the real Commodus was murdered in a palace conspiracy, strangled in his bath by his sparring partner, after 12 years as emperor. After 2 short-lived successors, the empire plunged into civil war, after which the victor, Septimius Severus, emerged as sole emperor.What I mean is that &quot;Gladiator&quot; is a very good film, but bad history. Which is fine - if one is aware of that.	4.0	Good movie (but not historically) in a technically good DVD	2001-11-03	3	3	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ADE852UR9121C	perfecto	"I remember first watching this movie in the cinema, because at that time there were no other movies showing that my friends and I have not watched. What followed was an amazing cinematic experience like no other, my eyes were glued on the screen at all times and I was literally on the edge of my seat. ""This is the story that would resonate in the years to come, the ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben-Hur"" of our time"", I was thinking to myself...and true enough, it took home 5 Academy Awards.Maximus is a grizzled war veteran in the eyes of his soldiers and the Emperor, Marcus Aurelius...but what he wants more than anything else is to go home to his wife and child and tend to his crops. After leading the Roman army to victory in one of the most breath-taking battle scenes I have seen in movie history, Marcus Aurelius summons Maximus to his camp, and asks him to take over administration of Rome until he sees fit to pass governance to the senators. Before Marcus Aurelius announces his decision, his son, a very upset Commodus kills the Emperor and takes his father's place. Commodus asks Maximus to swear loyalty to him, he doesn't and what follows is a story that is emotional, powerful and compelling at the same time.Strengthening the story in every way possible is a very talented cast, led by none other than Russell ""the Oscar"" Crowe. It seems that every movie he does earns him an Oscar nomination and in this movie, he deservedly won the award. Casting Crowe at that time was a brilliant decision by the film's director, Ridley Scott because he was relatively unknown, so we don't see Crowe as Maximus...we just see Maximus. His portrayal of the man was exceptional, every tear, every stare, every move speaks volumes. This was a man tormented about his past, unhappy about his present and doubtful about his future. This was one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. Of course, the rest of the cast are no less impressive. Joaquin Phoenix, as Commodus gave a fine performance as someone who is evil, not because he chooses to be, but because of the way he had been raised. He has felt vulnerable and not loved his whole life. It's easy to read his mind, ""Why do these people who hate me be treated any nicer?"" With a supporting cast that includes Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, you expect nothing but the best, and they do deliver in spades.The directing of the movie was also flawless. Ridley Scott knows what he's doing, he has a good idea what the audience is expecting and he makes the right decisions. Where other directors have tried and failed (Troy and Alexander comes to mind), Scott weaves a story that by the end of the movie, every person who is watching the movie, would want the hero to win..but will he? The anticipation that Scott evokes is what makes this movie special. The action sequences in this movie is also no walk in the park. They are shot with extreme precision, that when you watch it...every strike, every blow seems to be happening right in front of you. With a good home theater set, I am sure you will understand what I mean.But ultimately, no home theater set is needed for you to really appreciate this movie, the powerful storytelling and superb acting is the driving force behind this movie and I for one, am all for that.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3J58U5KF9F8LW	Peter A. Thomas	There have been a lot of reviews claiming that the picture quality of the new Gladiator Blu-ray transfer is poor. Not so. Most of these reviews were written before the Blu-ray was released. These Reviewers couldn't be more wrong regarding the transfer. I rented Gladiator from Netflix on the the second of September, and the picture quality of the transfer is superb. The sound quality is even more excellent. This transfer looks better than when I saw Gladiator in the theater, and wipes the floor with the previous two DVD releases. The theatrical version's transfer is the first I watched, then I viewed the extended version. Both are excellent transfers. It just goes to show that rumors are just that, rumors. Wait for the release to hit the market before you falsely review the picture quality or sound quality. It is wrong to make potential, interested buyers cancel their order based on a false claim/rumor. If you like Gladiator, this is a MUST BUY Blu-ray.	5.0	The Blu-Ray Transfer Is Excellent-Don't Believe the others	2009-09-02	34	6	28

The eerie candlelit scenes between Phoenix and Nielsen, with Zimmers haunting music in the background, make the movie for me; ""Busy little bee!"".  Scott does this same kind of staging in Bladerunner and Empire Of The Sun and it is hypnotic.2) His love of historical subject matter.This and Ben Hur are the greatest Roman Empire movies ever made."	5.0	I Cant Be Left Out	2009-11-28	2	2	0

I was simply amazed at how beautiful this film came out. The photography was breath-taking and Russell Crowe was perfectly cast. This is no-doubt the film he'll be remembered for as this one did for him what Titanic did for Leonardo DiCaprio. The real star of Gladiator however was Joaquin Phoenix. He was one of those villains that makes you almost want to root for the bad guy. This film was a breath of fresh air. See it as soon as you can unless you can't stomach violence.

I had to turn it off half way through to take a break before returning to the tripe.  I was hoping that somewhere along the line it would get better. The only saving grace of this movie was Joaquin Phoenix.  Russel Crowe's couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag.  Only epic movie I have seen where I actually was hoping someone would kill the &quot;hero&quot; and put me out of my misery. With all the money that was spent on the movie I would have thought the computer generation would have at least been good, but even that was poor - the scene with the tigers was comical.  As for the historical inaccuracies, using archers or saddles is minor, but a complete distortion of historical fact takes creative license too far.  Did Scott bother to read any Roman hisory at all?  First Aurelius - what the hell was Richard Harris doing in this movie - was not killed by his son Commodus, Aurelius had made Commodus co-emperor several years before he died, Commodus had his sister Lucilla executed after a failed assination attempt, and Commodus was strangled while taking a bath after a failed poisoning attempt by his mistress.  The most amusing thing about the film was that with all the British, Irish, and Australian accents I started to think that the British Empire started long before it actually did.  Overall, a thoroughly terrible movie.  How this movie can be nominated for Best Picture is beyond me.  If you want to see a great movie of this type go rent Spartacus or Ben Hur.	1.0	1 star is generous	2001-03-01	32	11	21
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A22ACSDILW5LT7	PHILIP T. RUIZ III	Russel Crowe and Ridley Scott prove beyond doubt that outstanding filmmaking is still all about masterful storytelling. The heroic tale of Maximus the general and gladiator keeps you spellbound from opening shot to the ending credits---thanks to the no-nonsense realism of Russel Crowe's portrayal , as well as the outstanding ---and sometimes scene stealing---performances by Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, and Richard Harris.Of course, the riveting visuals and perfect pacing of the film are all signature Ridley Scott and provide the story-telling with  gritty, contemporary, and ---on occasion---ethereal qualities.  Who would think that the sandals-and-toga genre would be this captivating ?Gladiator is an outstanding movie and certainly headed for hall-of-fame status.

Russell Crowe truly represented all those great things we would like to be ourselves. Joaquin Phoenix's acting exploration into the character of Commodus was artful.  The graphics were, of course, great and gave an astounding &quot;view&quot; of Rome at its height of beauty at its depth of immorality. Zimmer's music brought out the scenes with thought provoking melodies, orchestration and rhythms (e.g. waltzing during a battle) that helped carry the broad strokes of the story, the acting and the directing. Few movies compel me to watch it again and again, but this one is it!

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	Gladiator is a return to the sandals and robes epics that were so prevalent in the 1950's.  The film revolves around Russell Crowe's Maximus who was the emperor's favorite general and in fact was picked him to rule Rome upon his death instead of his own son, Commodus.  Commodus finds out about this, kills his father, takes control of the empire and orders Maximus to death.  Maximus escapes and ends up being sold as a slave.  Maximus' new master sees him as a gladiator and he is forced to fight in the arenas.  These fighting scenes are what make this movie so great.  They beautifully choreographed and the action is filled at a breakneck speed.  The fights are a bit gory and violent, but the violence is never gratuitous.  The technical wizardry of the day allows director Ridley Scott to recreate the Roman Coliseum in stunning detail.  Eventually Maximus and Commodus face each in the arena and the film comes to a surprising conclusion.  Mr. Crowe is superb as Maximus.  He has a commanding presence on the screen and he nicely balances the certain degree of pomposity and arrogance that the role requires with a subtly that make Maximus seem real.  The late Oliver Reed is great as the slave owner and Richard Harris has a fine cameo as the emperor.  As great as Mr. Crowe is, it is Joaquin Phoenix who steals the movie as Commodus.  He is perfectly evil in the role and he eats up every scene he is in.  The film recently won the 2000 Oscar as Best Picture and Mr. Crowe took home the Best Actor award.	5.0	Return To Rome	2001-03-27	20	15	5

I have never seen so many redundant reviews of the same movie, most of them from people who do not even own the blu-ray and are commenting based upon screen shots and others opinions. I have a sneaking suspicion that this is all an organized attempt to get Paramount to re-release this with a better print. Well... good luck with that.For me, this is not the best looking blu-ray out there, and a classic like this does deserve a better treatment. But it is the finest looking print of this movie. It is beautiful for the most part and whether you can see 11,000 arrows or 10,000 is irrelevant! Now I realize some of you are more perfectionists than I am and have wall sized screens that will show the flaws more than mine. But to label this some kind of travesty is laughable at best.If you love this movie then you will love this blu-ray. The complaints about the sound are unwarranted. It is the fullest sound I have heard and surpasses the mix of the original DVD. Again, that is my OPINION, so do not flail me over this.The disc comes with a $10.00 rebate if you own the DVD, so it is hardly a gamble to purchase the movie. Again, if you love the movie, it is time to buy it. If it gets re-released, then buy it again!

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2T1A688IYIK98	"""quantumsean"""	Ridley Scott silenced naysayers with his fantastic Roman Epic, Gladiator.  I absolutely love some of earlier Ridley Scott's films, and any Ridley Scott fan would absolutely love gladiator.  It is a very visually slick film, the cinemetography is top notch.  The look and feel is amazing.  The action is supurb. Part of the popularity of this movie has to deal with the amazing fight scenes that are portrayed in this movie.  Yes, the fight scenes are incredibly directed and are very intense.Even with all its technical prowess and action spectacles, Gladiator is not great because of this.  These aspects just greatly enhance what underlies it all: A fantastic story about a man and his longing for home.  The story and interaction between the characters is fantastic.  The general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator that defied an empire..... it is often an epic and ever engrossing film.My only complaint with the film (and keeping it from being a modern classic) is some problems with the script....  I would have liked to see more of the senate and the political dabblings of these corrupt individuals.  Oh well, can't ask too much. Gladiator should and deserves the oscar award.

One minute, he was going to get his army, the next, he was fighting the emporer in hand to hand combat. I didn't get it. It was like they ran out of money and couldn't pay the army, so they had to slap together a quick ending. And Russell Crowe's acting? Please. He plays every single role the same: the self-proclaimed inner hero, but with a hard outer shell. So now all of a sudden he's this artist?

It's Ridley Scott's best film, as well as Crowe's most impressive performance.But what really sold the film for me was the star-making turn by Joaquin Phoenix, River's little brother. Taking what could have easily been a one-note, one-dimensional &quot;villain&quot;, Phoenix absorbs the emperor in true pathos and mortality. His performance gives the film its emotional core, even though many would argue that that feat goes to Crowe. I believe that Scott's film is just as much about the emperor as it is the Gladiator.Props to an excellent production crew.

In fact, there are details present on the DVD that are missing from the Blu-ray.  On the other hand, Braveheart (released on Blu-ray on the same day) has a fantastic picture and makes Gladiator look even worse.

The first, be completely ignorant of the history of the Roman Empire and enjoy it for the great heroic epic it is.  The second (and way I chose) is to just ignore the errors, suspend disbelief, and enjoy it for the heroic epic it is.  Either way, as action, Gladiator can't be beat.  I even almost forgave that dog Crowe for messing around with a married woman (believe me Dennis, you're better off without her).  Crowe is close to perfect in the title role (if a bit flabby - Arnold would have been too big).  Richard Harris makes even over acting look good.  And Oliver Reed is a joy to watch.  Joaquin Phoenix . . . well, let's just say he was supposed to be unlikeable, not laughable.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3SARNBM5U4A20	RAUL DASILVA	We had grown used to Ridley Scott missing in action when it came to story concept, plotline and story elements.  He seems to have gotten away with these shortcomings because his taste for visual aesthetics is peerless.  He is one of the few working directors whose grasp of visual beauty is constant and always gratifying.In Gladiator, we are once again surprised because the grapevine said that the script was not really finished at the start and it kept changing with more than one writer in the pot mix.  Indeed, the Gladiator story is superficial and the concept as old as the hills of Rome, but one can hear an old song once more beautifully rendered.  Unquestionably, this is a beautifully realized film.  It has all the elements, including a great lead player and solid supporting cast.  Here, we bid good-bye to Oliver Reed, who died with three scenes left undone.  The scenes are not missed, but some of us will miss Reed.This DVD, especially the Extended Edition with lots of background features, is a keeper, thanks to an extraordinary filmmaker and company.	5.0	A beautifully realized film.	2006-02-25	0	0	0

But what seems to be overlooked here are the unmistakable parallels that can be drawn between this movie and Braveheart, the best epic in this genre.Ridley Scott delivers a solid product that rivals his best work (Alien, Blade Runner, Legend, and Thelma and Louise).  It may in fact be his best work to date.  Nevertheless, while watching the movie I couldn't help but keep thinking about how it felt like Braveheart.... set in Rome.Our hero is a reluctant soldier, who prefers to go home and run his farm and raise a family (sounds familiar?).  But instead the ones he loves are brutally massacred and he has nothing left to live for except revenge and justice (beginning to sound familiar yet).  As you would expect he ultimately achieves this, but with a tragic conclusion that when compared to Braveheart now begins to feel clich&eacute;d.Please remember, however, that this is a good movie... in fact its one of the best movies in 2000 (and yes this does not say much, because this has been a dismal year for movies).  The open battle is grand, but Scott films it in style that tries to hard capture the chaos of battle and this results in a sequence that lacks in coherence and lucidity.Nevertheless, if you haven't seen this movie, and you love epics that play in this space, then WATCH THIS MOVIE! ...

Unfortunately, Amazon is still sending out the old version at least in my case.  I called Paramount Home Entertainment (888-889-9456) and they verified my copy I rec'd on Aug. 10 was the old version. They also indicated the old version had been pulled & discontinued. Verification was done by asking two questions: 1) What was the color of the UPC label, yellow not white is the new version, and 2) What is the ID number on the back side of Disc 1 near the center. I had to use a magnifying glass to read it beginning with the letters ""NA"" and ending with ""R1"" for the old version or ""R2"" for the new.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1LDIMQISH07WK	Rebecca	Okay, let's get the facts straight: GLADIATOR is a really good movie that had been very overhyped. The background of the film was specatcular, though I do think they went a little overboard with the setting, and the special effects/sound effects were amazing, too. After all, when my parents rented this video (they had turned up the volume, of course), I could hear the sound perfectly and clearly all the way upstairs in my closed bedroom! Talk about excellent sound effects.The acting was pretty supurb, too. Especially Russell Crowe. And I think he deserved the Oscar for Best Actor. Well...it's actually kind of hard to tell (especially that &quot;affair&quot; he had with actress Meg Ryan!). The action is awesome, too. But some of the Oscars I don't believe this film should have won. Sometimes, I believe the only reason this film won all those Oscars was because it was so overhyped and it hit big in the box office. But flat out, good film and definitely one that shouldn't be missed. I really enjoyed it and it gives accurate historical events and the setting and costumes make you feel like you've actually traveled back in time during the Roman Empire.Still, this film doesn't top my list of favorite films of 2000. Some of the other 2000 films that I enjoyed a lot more were ALMOST FAMOUS, BILLY ELLIOT, and CAST AWAY. It would probably be in my honorable mentions list. But GLADIATOR is definitely worth your money and you definitely have got to see this film!	4.0	Almost perfect.	2001-04-24	3	1	2

It GRABS you from the very first, less than 5 minutes into the opening, and doesn't end until the movie is over.  Even then, I recall wandering out of the theatre, almost in a ""fugue"" state of mind.  THAT'S how powerful was the movie's moral is, not to mention plot, character development, protagonist vs antagonist, all the way from the gripping start to the ending.  Evil vs. Honor, the ""parable"" of the consequences of choosing to live the thrill of EXHILERATION, acheived ONLY via the absorbtion of selfish greed and power, compared to the everlasting courage of a principlied, moral, ethical, self-effacing life.Actually, Ridley Scott DID do another classic - Alien (the original.)

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1CZW5JPNSSAA1	Reputator	I am pleased to report that the version I received, ordered on the 1st of December, was the remastered version. While the original release has seen a lot of highly vocal backlash, the remastered version couldn't look any better. Simply put, it is reference quality, pushing the detail envelope enabled by the blu-ray resolution to its limits, and showing the film as it was truly intended by the filmmakers. Pristine, with bold colors and exemplary contrast, this is how a blu-ray master should be. Paramount sacrificed some marginally bad PR (the importance of a small percentage of home theater enthusiasts is disputable in the grand scheme of things) in exchange for not having to recall their previous version, and seemingly going out of their way to mask the differences on the outside packaging to make distinguishing the two more difficult. It's getting almost to the point now that you might be better off simply putting the disc in your player and looking at the image yourself to see which version it is. You can be sure that if you receive the newer version, which will only become more probable as time goes on, that it will not be representative of all the bad ratings it has garnered here on Amazon. Contrarily, it will be an indispensable addition to any discerning blu-ray collector, and one worthy of showcasing your home theater system with. Highly recommended to those willing to take the (quickly dwindling) risk.	5.0	Recieved remaster	2010-12-03	5	5	0

Watched this on: Pioneer BDP-51FD Blu-ray player > Pioneer Elite SC-07 Receiver > Pioneer Kuro PDP-6020FD. This looks great unless you want grain, you cant notice any enhanced edges or smudging. Wish I hadnt read all the reviews since it made me look for it during the movie.

On the whole it's not an emotional film, which I found quite surprising, but if you like action and you're a lover of history (without casting too much of a critical eye on the accuracy of the history), then you'll love it! The special effects are brilliant and the storyline is good for what could potentially be a very boring film in the hands of the wrong director.The only complaint I had having seen the DVD, was that they left out a couple of really good scenes, which would have completed the film quite nicely.	5.0	MAXIMUS!

The R rating is for blood (fake, of course, but well done) and your kids have seen worse on TV.  There is no sex or even bad language!  The growling tigers are the best I've seen on film since Sheena QOJ in the 50's!  For a Dreamworks production, this film is surprisingly free of political undertones (except of the anti-Gore ilk, if you'll forgive the pun), unlike the (for interracial sex in the first 10 minutes) 15REW-rated The Perfect Storm. It's just a plain good action movie, not unlike Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning BRAVEHEART, his PATRIOT, and Spielberg's last decent film the Oscar-winning SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  The action is surrounded by and laced with excellent acting in the best British tradition.  The two newbies, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, are good additions to the seasoned cast.  Phoenix, with his harelip scar, is destined to be typecast as a slimeball, I'm afraid, but he does it well.  Nielsen, a Sela Ward lookalike, holds up her role as the only sexy personage in the film very well.  And speaking of scars, the perfectly-scarfaced Tommy Flanagan reappears as Cicero, Russell Crowe's aide-de-camp.  (He was Mel Gibson's aide-de-camp in Braveheart, the prima-nocte-&quot;offended husband.&quot;) This DVD was well-worth the $$ spent for it.	5.0	Gladiator -- Best of old and new	2000-11-23	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1OW7A7HW60ZVV	Rich Williams	It amazes me that movies about Roman Gladiators are so few.  All the attributes that movie-makers long for; adventure, romance, action, heroism - can be found in a good Gladiator story.  This is why my surprise at the success of Gladiator is somewhat muted.If anyone could put together a modern day epic such as Gladiator it would be Ridley Scott.  Through films such as Bladerunner, Thelma and Louise, and Alien, Mr. Scott has been revealed as one of our foremost storytellers.  His ability to take a conceptually challenging story and make it almost universally accessible, must surely be enviable amongst his peers.Gladiator follows this tradition by taking what was once considered &quot;old news&quot; and pumping it full of modern day movie steriod.  The war sequence well surpasses anything that Mel Gibson (Braveheart, The Patriot) has yet put together and the gladiator fights are brutal but not distasteful in their depiction.From the first frame to the last, I found myself enthralled at this story of a famous Roman general who, when unjustly disgraced, falls into a life of slavery.  His rise through the ranks of the Roman gladiators to a point where he can finally face his nemesis, although bloody, is treated decently.Russell Crowe, who plays the part of General Maximus, is superb.  Indeed, his performance is somewhat reminiscent of Kirk Douglas's Spartacus in that the personality of the character overshadows his physicality.  Russell Crowe was a relative unknown when this movie was first filmed and if Mr. Scott ever considered this casting decision a risk then I believe he hit the jackpot.  I believe we may be watching the creation of a new superstar.Other stellar performances are provided by Joaquin Phoenix, Richard Harris, and Oliver Reed (Who sadly died during the making of Gladiator).Mr. Scott did not skimp on his use of technology in this movie, although this is not entirely apparent until you review the bonus features on the DVD.  In particular, the digital recreations of Rome and the Colussium are stunning.I would suggest at this point that you grab your credit card and order this movie right away.  It will be one of the most welcome additions to your DVD collection this year.	5.0	Stunning Adventure!	2001-01-02	18	15	3

There is no explicit sex (and the only innuendo is shown as desired by one party and rejected by the other, and not accomplished) and only one or two instances of swearing. There are, however, definitely some adult themes of vengeance, incest (desired by the evil emperor, so it's given proper moral context), and gore. Lots of gore.

After escaping his execution, Maximus returns home and finds his family brutally murdered. Alone and broken, Maximus is enslaved and forced to the life of an arena gladiator. With his courage and skill, Maximus earns the admiration of the Roman public and rivals the authority of the new emperor.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1O7P2HKGHHBI0	"""rmacd"""	Don't be distracted by the nanny school of movie critics; this movie will take your breath away.  Gladiator has it all (well, not quite--there's no sex):  a truly powerful--and appealing--lead performance by Russell Crowe, stunning cinematography, the superbly paced direction that made Ridley Scott famous, and a moving soundtrack.Crowe's brute magnetism powers Maximus, a heroic figure that Crowe manages to make entirely believable.  The supporting actors are strong as well, particularly Connie Nielson (although she does hit one slightly off note at the end of the movie).Folks, this movie is BIG; it's ambitious, and it succeeds.  Gladiator isn't quite perfect: the special visual effects are a mixed bag, some fabulous, a few slightly hokey, and the performances from Oliver Reed and Joachin Phoenix, though generally impressive, are just a bit over the top.  The necessities of keeping the movie a reasonable length (it ended up at about 2:20) meant the deletion of some scenes whose absence hurt the plot line.  (You can see many of the deleted scenes on Disc II of the DVD set, and I think most of us would have elected to keep most of them in, even if it meant a 3 hour movie.)  But the movie's strengths dwarf its few weakness, and the overall effect is undeniably powerful.Most movie critics are cynics, which predisposes them to dislike heroic epics.  Gladiator is not cynical; Crowe's Maximus, like the real-life Maximus described by Marcus Aurelius in &quot;The Meditations,&quot; is an example of strength, courage, and honor.  Still, the propulsive force of Gladiator is so potent, it managed to win over a substantial body of critics.Note to parents:  while I strongly recommend this movie to those mature enough for it (and it includes neither sex nor profanity, for those who care about such things), its violence will frighten young children.	5.0	A Stunning and Powerful Epic, but Not for the Highly Cynical	2001-02-17	3	1	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A361LE16VBQDP8	Robert Bezimienny	In an interview prior to this film's release, Russell Crowe disclosed that when asked to read the script he found it to be only '70%' complete - a friend of his advised him to do the film anyway, on the strength of Ridley Scott's past record.  Some 8 months later, with the shooting about to begin, Crowe looked at the script again, and much of it had been discarded, leaving only about 30% intact.  Somewhat apprehensive, Crowe took his concerns to Scott, who consoled him with a confident, 'We'll make it up as we go along', or words to that effect.  This attitude betrays the cynicism with which Hollywood treats its own products and, in particular, its screenwriters.  If the budget allocated for, say, the rather fake looking CGI tigers had been allocated to script development, then (who knows) a good movie might have been created.  Instead we have this.  The deficiencies of story not withstanding, it was surpising to see the film fail on many technical levels.  Firstly, the editing deserves to be singled out for special condemnation.  Clumsy abrupt cuts, gratuitous effects, poorly compiled battle and fight sequences: the list could be extended.  Secondly, the short cuts required to computer generate a colloseum (only some 30 degrees of the entire 360 were rendered, the illusion created by repeating this segment) see a distanced (and surprisingly small) crowd of Roman onlookers - the gladiatoral 'spectacle' seems less exciting than your typical weekend football game, the arena itself often appearing artificial and quite 'empty'.  Thirdly,...well what is the point of going on...  While George Lucas and Speilberg at least try to learn from masters such as Kurosawa, Scott appears happy draw upon his earlier experience in television advertising - and, hey, we all know advertising works, it's often clever and entertaining, it's lots of things, but it's just not great cinema.	1.0	Let's make it up as we go along	2001-06-09	27	10	17
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ	Robert Blake	Ridley Scott's &quot;Gladiator&quot; is a roaring, romantic, moving spectacle about the glory that was Rome. This is a great film, one that brings back classic themes of the cinema that we haven't seen since the days &quot;Spartacus&quot; or &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; or even &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; stirred screen audiences. People have been waiting exactly for this kind of film for a long time. The purpose of a movie like &quot;Gladiator&quot; is to exhilarate the viewer and capture him with red-blooded drama and action. The screenplay by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson barrows from other films and molds into a riveting story, a simple yet entertaining tale. Ridley Scott (Alien, G.I. Jane) directs with the eyes of a master, with great taste for epic material. The cinematography by John Mathieson is rich, making some scenes look like classic paintings of Ancient Rome. The editor is Pietro Scalia, who won an Oscar for Oliver Stone's &quot;JFK,&quot; he creates some great, gritty, bone-crunching action sequences. And of course, the music by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is effective, moving and a romping experience all in itself. &quot;Gladiator&quot; also works for women, it's not just a guy-flick, it has a nice, sensual feeling to the romantic material. This is fun, moving and enjoyable cinema. &quot;Gladiator&quot; will call you back for a second viewing.	5.0	A Rousing Epic.	2001-01-13	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2UF61ZDRDMGR3	"Robert H. Bedford ""Rob H. Bedford"""	For starters, I loved the movie when it was in theaters so it should be no surprise that I love the DVD.  The opening battle scene is phenominal and the transfer to DVD is amazing.  From the dark opening scenes in Germania to the beauty of the city of Rome--the cinematography is breathtaking.  Russel Crowe is perfect as Maximus, he is a great actor in a career defining role.  While he kicked but and took names in L.A. Confidential, he simply annihilates everything in his path as Maximus; while earning the respect of his soldiers as a general and peers as a slave turned gladiator turned hero.Joaquin Phoniex did a fine job as the revolting Caesar who cries and whines for respect he does not deserve.  All of the actors were great and the film from beginning to end is truly a masterpiece of modern filmmaking.  The spiritual framing sequences of Maximus in the the wheat (?) were a nice touch as well.  The only thing holding back from a 5 stars is the movie was a little slow at times.An adrenaline pumping heart wrenching story.  If you own a DVD player, buy this DVD.  If you don't own a DVD Player-buy one just so you can appreciate this amazing DVD.	5.0	Battles to the Top (4.75 stars)	2000-12-04	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	I am a big fan of Ridley Scott, but I think this is one of his worst films.  On the positive side, this film has the unique atmospherics that you expect from his productions, the acting is strong, and he strives to inject interesting historical themes into the plot.  However, given that I have loved so many of his films, this one disappointed me.  I guess I could say its effects are so spectacular that Scott thought he could coast on them, that the film's content and characters have a laziness about them that I would not expect from a great filmmaker like Scott.  The characters are two-dimensional, the action is hardly realistic, and the themes so maudlin and milked for effect that it disgusted me at times.In addition, as a Rome history buff, I admit that I am put off by the wildly ridiculous inaccuracies in the film.  It's just an action film, so I can imagine viewers who liked it would tell me to lighten up.  Scott makes it into a discourse on democracy - Marcus Aurelias' general wants to bring back the republic, Commodus wants it to stay an autocracy - when it was nothing like that; the republic had been dead for over 100 years.  Moreover, removing the insane Commodus solved nothing:  Rome headed into a catastrophic period of instability in the passage of power, yet the film makes it look like that was all that was needed.  Granted, I suppose I should look at it purely as an action film, and it is a good action film, with blood guts, and daring.  The trouble is, I saw and loved The Duellists, one of his early films, so I know that he can pull off an absolutely first rate historical film, with realistic and yet unusual characters, without glaring make-believe, and deep themes that stick with the viewer, in my case for decades.  I was hoping that this film would be similar, and it certainly could have been.  Instead, it is a crude formula film, though lavish in production.	3.0	melodrama that is all glitz, little substance	2011-09-19	14	2	12
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A30JWBSVCFYXPE	"Robert Knetsch ""Wanna-be theologian"""	I had heard that this was a &quot;guy movie&quot; full of action and even gore!  Well, being the &quot;enlightened&quot; guy I am, I went with my nose high, expecting to be mildly entertained, that my base desires would be met.But, like a child, I was enthalled with the film and watched with wide eyed wonder.  The cinematography at the beginning of the film with the war scene was absolutely breathtaking.  It rivalled the beginning of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; though it was a little less disturbing.  Only a little less so.What I was surprised about was the great plot.  Sure, it was about the super-human hero, the rugged male who stuck by his own morals no matter what.  His honour superceded everything, no matter what horror came to him.  Yes, it was a bit &quot;American&quot; and individualistic, but it was done so well, it captivated me.  I truly felt his sadness and his anger.Ridley Scott of Blade Runner fame directed this film superbly.  I particularly loved the frquest flashes to the fields of heaven - it was this mix of beauty and action that captured my interest.  He was able to make me truly enjoy this film.  The acting by Crowe was a great compliment as well.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	My rating indicates my regard for this film in terms of its entertainment value. The plot is essentially uncomplicated and too often predictable. There is almost no character development. And there is only one conflict, really, whose resolution occurs long after the most thrilling action has occurred. However, Russell Crowe's performance as Maximus is (no pun intended) commanding, the special effects are first-rate, and -- from beginning to end -- this film is visually stunning. The plot (such as it is) focuses on Maximus who, soon after his greatest military victory, finds himself enslaved and in training to become a gladiator. (By then we already know that he is a fearless and skillful warrior.) Eventually, circumstances enable him to return to Rome where he hopes to gain revenge on Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) for reasons which should not be revealed in a commentary such as this. Although working with an idea-impoverished screenplay, director Ridley Scott keeps the narrative moving along at a brisk but appropriate pace. Although Crowe dominates the screen (and was later selected to receive an Academy Award as best actor), others in the cast provide strong performances. I was especially impressed by Phoenix, Richard Harris' brief appearance as Marcus Aurelius, Oliver Reed (Proximo), Djimon Hounsou (Juba), Derek Jacobi (Gracchus), and Connie Nielsen as Commodus' sister Lucilla.For me, three years after seeing Gladiator for the first time, the dominant images are no longer those of the life-or-death competition but rather, of the opening scenes when Maximus leads his troops to victory against the Saxons, later when he returns to his farm, and still later when he and Juba nourish their friendship with exchanges of confidences. How ironic that a film so filled with brilliantly-staged violence should persist in my memory because of images wholly unrelated to that violence. It received an Academy Award as best film as well as for best costume design, sound, and visual effects. I think it is a notch or two above earlier and similar films such as The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) but not quite in the same league with the director's cut version of Spartacus (1960). One man's opinion.	5.0	Visually Stunning Presentation of a Simple Plot	2003-08-12	1	1	0

It's hard to get it anywhere except from some of the great epic films of the past like ""Quo Vadis,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Demetrius and the Gladiators,"" ""Barabbas,"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire.""Scott's ""Gladiator"" is build around a mythic character, a man trying to find his way home... It is around someone finding inner strength in a tough time...Maximus is somebody who doesn't want to be a soldier... We realize this is a man who is pursuing the ultimate which is transcending death and finding love after death which completely transforms your reaction to the man, a man who is very, very strong but very, very loving...One of the most successful bits of casting was Oliver Reed... He's a gruff businessman who makes his living off the death machine and yet, inside, there was some kind of ethical person that would come out at the right moment...Ridley Scott creates a lot of beautiful scenes between the characters... He did some fantastic work in all of those wonderful scenes in the film... One of the best scenes of the motion picture is where Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is told by his father that he is not going to be the emperor... But there's another moment between Harris and the Danish beauty Connie Nielsen that I liked very much... Harris says, ""Let's not speak of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I'm a good father. "" They walk for a few seconds and Lucilla says, ""This is a pleasant fiction."" I felt this short scene so sophisticated... It seemed to me wonderfully insightful, simple in terms of amount of words, but complex in terms of understanding this relationship...The plot, familiar from Anthony Mann's "" Fall of the Roman Empire,"" had Russell Crowe as Maximus, the proud well-loved Roman general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Maximus whose motto is ""Strength and Honor"" is like a son to Aurelius, a statement that left Aurelius' own son, Commodus perturbed...Disappointed by the news that his father privately decides to name Maximus his successor, and being a young ambitious son lusting for power, he murders his father, and orders a strike against the general... Joaquin Phoenix is easy to hate in a frightening and vile character... Ridley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying, blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall...Through its beautiful music, through Russell's performance and through Ridley's soulfulness, ""Gladiator"" brought a poetic vision in a new and very cinematically luxurious way that really gave the audience something different, so emotional and intimate..."	4.0	Scott's epic romanticizes a big, brawny heroic adventure...	2006-12-31	3	2	1

But in this case, I have to say that region 4 rocks. The DVD presentation is the same, the extras are the same, and the quality is the same.... BUT.... you have spanish dialoge, portuguese dialoge spanish subtitles, thai subtitles, chinese subtitles, portuguese subtitles,and other subtitles I don't remember.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AK1OBVI54SY73	"Rocky ""Raquel"""	Truly it wasn't. My friend and I watched the film and we were expecting a lot more excitement than there was. My friend was right there was way too much dramatics and not enough action and the acting in itself was kind of lame in parts. Russell Crowe is a very wooden actor to me. It's like he had one face on the whole time in the film and I was thinking what is he truly feeling right here- is he mad, sad, worried? Russell is not the best actor again the wooden performance he gave turned me off from the passion that the film should have been leaking out. And every leading actress is always trying to find justice and also wants something extra from the man who is supposed to bring this justice- I mean that is getting so cliche and I didn't like watching that same old material in this film. Couldn't the Ceaser's sister just want to save her home without any romantic feelings involved? I mean honestly. That is kind of stereotypical and it gets old. Braveheart did the same thing and I think these romances are rushed and honestly there is no time for them. Like I said, the drama was overdone and there wasn't enough action.The only interesting parts were where Russell was standing ready to fight. The tiger scene was particuarly interesting and the woman with the arrows. Then at the very end with the very last fight scene. And these interesting parts hardly took long to finish, and then once more they went back to the dramatics. I don't know, maybe I'm too picky, but I have seen better historic films and this definitely is a mere average historic film. It was nothing breakthrough except for the plot, which didn't carry out too well. With a few more fight scenes, and a few snip snips to the overfilled drama and a cut out of the romance between the ceaser's sister and Russell- it doesn't work at all in that film- I don't think this film wouldn't have been bad. What historical film- makers need to know is that when we watch swords and armor we expect to see that a lot of the time, and when their armor comes off then they better have a good and interesting reason for it that keeps the movie going into more exciting scenes instead of lazing off into dramatics we could care less about and further just bore us. Just a pinch of drama and plenty of fight scenes is what a historical film is- I think people don't get that at this present time and that is why I am constantly bogged down with drama- fillers like Alexander that I am fooled in thinking will actually be an exciting action film.Remember people- critics love drama. So when a historical movie gets awards, think about it twice first.	3.0	It Is Nothing Special...	2005-10-02	36	3	33

That's because anyone who might have,has seen every lame trick in this movie used again and again. I don't know where to begin as the list would be too long.I prefer the real life action like Ultimate street brawls at least thats real.I liked Russell in LA Confidential and that's about it. The mere thought of him having a Best Actor trophy makes me shudder.I mean, come on-all he had to do to prepare for this role was cut out 5 hours of sleep every night. His routine with the scowling and talking raspy got so old after the first half-hour, I still ask myself why I didn't leave the theatre at any point thereafter. My bad.I will give the movie credit for the few fightscenes that came across as very brutal and somewhat epic, but these moments are basically few and far between. Sets are pretty much flawless and the costumes are well done, both of which create total believability in the environments. Ok, enough with the compliments.	1.0	Boring	2001-12-02	9	2	7
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A214QCK2BMXN7M	Roger Twitchell	I was very impressed by Ridley Scott's truly magnificent depiction of his vision for the film.  One can nitpick all sorts of details in the film as historically inaccurate etc., but if those details were rendered more accurately they would often actually interfere by being misinterpreted by modern audiences.  Richard Harris portrays the philosophical Emperor Marcus Aurelius very, very well; his character meshes almost perfectly with the thoughts written down in the real Marcus' excellent _Meditations_ well enough to be uncanny.  (The sole exception is essential for the film's plot.)Oliver Reed is also excellent as the gritty, wizened gladiator camp operator Proximo.Russell Crowe brings great force of character to Maximus, a very high-ranking Roman general with long-standing connections at the very top of the food chain so to speak, who also remains down-to-earth and sensitive enough to be personally admired by his troops.  He brings that combination of sensitivity, intelligence and able willingness to bring on extreme yet controlled force (simply and very effectively of emotion at times) to his scenes throughout the film to great effect.The Germania battle scene is probably most accurate and incredible depiction of Roman war techniques the screen will see for a very long time.  Occasional suspension of disbelief is required there though; Ridley Scott is depicting a vision of a great, well-equipped but increasingly challenged superpower military in action effectively enough, so just don't nitpick some of its treatment of ballistic physics or other small details that could make you wonder.  Sit back and be impressed (and set your player to full-width widescreen).The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard (who invented her own language of indescribable sounds specifically for emotional effect) is masterful, helping carry the action and intensity along without interruption from scene to scene.The depiction of Imperial Rome was impressive overall, depicting it as somewhat more organized in layout than it actually was, again I suspect to support his depiction of &quot;the greatness of Rome&quot; for his vision of the film.  The outside views of the CGI Colosseum again be nitpicked, but it's still very impressively done and the views from center stage of the roaring crowds in the realistic, well-detailed gleaming marble interior make up for it.  Considering that the bloodsport put on in the Colosseum was put on for folks generally of little more than what we'd consider a 2nd-grade education, I won't criticize the previously WWF-compared combatant presentation style.The camera work is also excellent, especially when including the touchingly done Elysian Fields scenes.The outcome is not what you'd expect from a typical Hollywood lots-of-fights film, not at all.Ridley Scott has set out to display the challenges faced by real people whose roots lay in a collectively held fierce desire to build something people of any time could look back at in both awe and humble respect, but who then found themselves having achieved most of that dream while also finding that realized dream half-occupied by the ever-present dark side of human nature.  He succeeds magnificently; that is what in my opinion makes it a truly great film.	4.0	Gladiator	2004-02-20	0	0	0

I think Russell Crowe equally deserves at least a nod for Best Actor, although he will have some tough competition in Tom Hanks (Castaway) and Mel Gibson (The Patriot).

Two examples are &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Boys Don't Cry.&quot; Both excellent films, and very moving, but once is more than enough.By contrast, I can never get enough of Russell Crowe (&quot;Maximus&quot;) or Ridley Scott (the Director) who are the real stars of this film.Ridley Scott is a genius for transporting the viewer to alien worlds whether they are in the far future (&quot;Blade Runner&quot;) or the distant past, as he does here in Gladiator.If you are guy and the opening battle sequence does nothing to get your blood pumping, then you are, as Maximus exhorts his soldiers in that scene &quot;...already dead.&quot;	5.0	Galdiator Rocks	2001-01-05	2	2	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2SXOIKOS87ZII	Ronnie	I could not wait for Gladiator to come out, being a HUGE fan of Russell Crowe since I saw L.A. Confidential.  I dragged a friend of mine with me to watch it because she had never seen one of his movies.  Neither of us were dissappointed.  The movie captivated me from the beginning action sequence.  From there the movie just got better and better.  This movie is definatley a movie for both sexes too: for the men you have the obvious action, and for the women you have well, Russell Crowe.  Ridley Scott does a fantastic job directing this movie, bring ancient Rome back, forever immortalizing it.  Joaquin Pheonix is great in this movie, playing the perfect bad guy.  I hated his character just as much as Maximus does.  The graphics of this movie are awesome, i can just see the Collisseum in all it glory and feel the awe the citiznes must have felt just looking at the city.  As a person who took Latin and study Roman history, and watching tons of movies about this time period, I can honestly say that this by far teh best of out of all of them.	5.0	Woohoo!	2000-11-12	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AKATOKRYX7F9N	"R. Ortega ""Movie Collector"""	"Gladiator (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray]""A Ridley Scott Film"" ... what more is to be said. Scott has to be ranked up in the top 10 Director's in the last 50 years! Brillant film, excellent masterpiece, riveting performance's by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou: (who's making a name for himself in cinema) and applause for the rest of the outstanding cast put together including Richard Harris. This film is an attribute of pure genious, as far as, production, direction, and cinematography. In my own words 'Bravo' ... there's not enough superlatives or accolades that has not been already attributed to this movie. This film is liken the movies of epic perportions of the late 1950's into the early 60's, with it's magnificent cast and colossal action. Especially on the Blu-ray Disc 'Sapphire Series' and it's extended version, as an option. The Blu-ray transfer is the best I have seen to this date with it's rich and vivid color, sound, aspect-ratio. It's as if you were sitting in a theater and much more. It's definetely a keeper for your library with the additional bonus disc loaded with special features. I personally have three copies of this movie, the first release on DVD, the 'Signature Selection' two dvd set and the Blu-ray Disc ""Sapphire Series""."	5.0	Gladiator	2009-10-30	10	7	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4	"Ross McKenzie ""ross"""	An powerful empire,a new ruler,and a man worthy enough to  change a dynasty,a slave who would become a gladiator, a man who become legendary to his people.Ridley Scott's epic so beautiful so intense , so gripping , and so dramatic that it can only be  called truly epic.Academy Award nominee Russel Crow gives this  Roman epic life in his role as Maximus the brave slave general who is betrayed by his empire for not complying with the wish  of his new ruler Commodus (Joquin Pheonix) who has forced him  self as the new ruler of Rome by killing the previous Ceaser  for not giving Commodus rule over Rome.Commodus is a pitiful  ruler that is calculating , benevolent , pathetic , hateful  when Maximus refuses to take Commodus's hand in rule he finds that he pays the price when he looses everything dear to him and is forced into slavery to become a Gladiator , when he  becomes a great Gladiator he is given the honor to fight in  the colloseium when he becomes a hero amongst the people he is forced to give his identity as Maximus the general gaining  the support from his men , he devises a plan to escape and join his soldiers to build an army to overthrow Commodus from power when Commodus finds out the plan of Maximus he gives  the people of Rome a chance to see the great fall of the  great Maximus by challenging him in one on one combat to  the death , Maximus see's this as a chance to bring Rome  out of chaos and give it the order and freedom it deservesfor it's people in doing so he will risk his life to be the greatist hero Rome has ever known.Russel Crowe is an even more fitting potrayal of a  Gladiator then even Kirk Douglas he gives his charachter  more depth and a human side , it's evident that Crowe is one the best newcomers hollywood has ever seen he is very versitle in films and Gladiator only shows that to an even greater extent.Joqiun Pheonix is a great match for Crowe  giving Commodus depth and making us feel pity the he is  the way he is and his hatered for Maximus and his uprising. Ridley Scott has an imaginative veiw to detail as some of  the set's are detailed to what Rome would have looked like in this time the costumes accurate and the cinimatography is astounding.This may be an action movie but this movie  is worthy of it's predeccesors Sparticus , Ben Hur ,  Cleopatra they don't even near as get close to the vison of Rome the empire then in this movie.So people invest  in a DVD player cause this one is well worth the money  a truly epic film.	5.0	Truly epic driven by Ridley Scott's ingenious.	2000-11-20	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"Russel Crowe is Maximus, the Spanish-born General who has brought the Roman empire its final victory against the barbarians. Now with Roman rule stretching out across the world, and knowing of Ceaser Marcus Aurelius' desire to return the rule of gov't to the Roman Senate, Maximus seeks only to return to his family. Everybody has other plans however. Corrupt Senators who prefer the old way, and the emperor's amoral son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), want the popular general to support their plans for Empire, while the sage Aurelius (Richard Harris) tags Maximus to head an interim government with the aim of restoring the supremacy of senatorial rule. Dispatching his father and naming himself Ceasar, the evil Commodus orders the deaths of Maximus and his family. Escaping, Maximus reaches his family in time to witness their brutal murders at the hand of Roman soldiers, before he is enslaved and sold to Proximo (Oliver Reed). Once a gladiator, Proximo now trains other slaves to fight in the crumbling arenas of the empire's fringe-provinces. Not revealing his identity at first, Maximus bides his time, knowing he will eventually reach Rome and revenge himself. Distinguishing himself in the arena (he brings teamwork to the other gladiators who are supposed to fight for themselves), Maximus has his wish and returns to Rome where he gives Ceaser Commodus a rude shock. Winning the hearts of the Romans (if spectators of the brutal games can be said to have any heart), Maximus becomes a larger figure in Roman society as a slave than a general, looming larger than the emperor himself. Becoming desperate as his subjects begin to idolize the gladiator, the ever grim and demented emperor resorts to ever more severe measures to undermine the ex-general both within and without the coliseum.I didn't want to see ""Gladiator"", but Russell Crowe and Director Ridley Scott won me over. While Scott gets a lot of mileage out if his charachters, none of whom are really defined, it's his vision of the Empire (c. 180) that makes the film. Sure we know it's all CGI, but Scott's trademark touches (smoky light, bustling crowds, and constantly having something - whether smoke, garlands, rolls of bread or snowdrifts) create an ambient setting that is either cold, or hot, dry and sandy or swampy, but lways enveloping. Like the spanish general, Russel Crowe conquers the film as the brooding Maximus, the husband of a murdered wife, father of a murdered son and redeemer of the enslaved empire of Rome."	4.0	A hero has arisen!!!	2001-02-05	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AY3AVLL5IWW9	Russell Fanelli	I agree with all the reviews in Amazon that caution buyers from purchasing this extended presentation of Gladiator.  The added story frames are not enough to make up for the significant loss in sound quality, particulary during quiet moments when the dialogue is difficult to hear, even with the sound turned up.Many reviewers are also angry with all the historical inaccuracies in the film -- too many for me to list here.  Even so, I think most people don't go to the movies to get history.  If they do, they are almost certain to be disappointed even with films that make a point of trying to be accurate.  Story always seems to take precedence over truth value.Russell Crowe won the academy award as best actor for his  perfomance as Maximus, Roman general turned gladiator.  He dominates the film from beginning to end, and a good thing too.  It is his story we care about, not the senatorial nonsense that comprises only a small part of the film.  Crowe is good enough to give this movie five stars.  Earlier versions of the film are the best bet for first time viewers because of improved sound quality.	5.0	Russell Crowe outstanding as Maximus.	2005-09-14	3	3	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2N1KXZVM9X53Y	R. Weber	I don't think I've written a review on Amazon yet for as much as I've shopped here, but I felt compelled to review this Blu-Ray release.  Gladiator is one of my favorite movies and I was quite excited about this release.  To much dismay, most of the movie visually feels like I am watching an upscaled DVD.  There are some moments that shine, but the difference between the great quality of the extended scenes and the processing that plagues the theatrical scenes are very noticeable that it has really made me question why the whole movie couldn't be transferred with the superb visuals displayed in the extended scenes.Overall, the movie is still great with a nice bundle of extras included, but I am still very disappointed with the video quality of the theatrical footage which is what I was mostly looking forward to with this purchase.	2.0	Should be better than it is	2009-09-03	16	12	4
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3AKPY4LXIC24O	Ryan Costantino	I didn't know what to expect when I went to see Gladiator in the theater.  Spartacus?  Braveheart invades Rome?  No story and lots of blood?  Well, I was right about the blood and wrong about everything else.  Ridley Scott's epic vision of a wronged and enslaved Roman general, of political corruption, of revenge and honor is a prime example of what a good movie ought to be.Russel Crowe (L.A. Confidential, The Insider) plays Maximus, the Roman Empire's greatest general, who is betrayed by the dead emperor's son (played by the film's only flaw, Joaqin Phoenix) is first enslaved, then by becoming a gladiator he gradually works his way back to Rome to find his family murdered, which only throws salt on his wounds.  The story of injustice righted is highlighted by spectacular action sequences that are extremely violent and realistic (which is what initially kept bringing people back to see the film in theaters) but the story is involving (thanks to Russel Crowe's brilliant performance) enough to warrant repeated viewings.  All in all Gladiator is the best movie of 2000, period.  Nothing released this year will match the beauty and grand scale of this film.  So if you like good movies make sure you get your copy of this wonderful film.  Expect plenty of Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations (and wins) for this film, for direction, acting, cinematography, and special effects no other film has delivered the goods in such a spectacular package this year.	5.0	The Best Movie of 2000, Period	2000-11-18	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A33EQA6FIKKAOF	Ryan	Now I'm not saying the image quality is perfect. There are halos around the characters and little strands of hair in some scenes. Image enhancement has obvisouly been used. Is it as horrible and distracting as some people make it out to be? Far from it in my case.I was blown away by the level of clarity showcased in this movie. Every fine detail in a characters face, in the architecture of the sets and city shots, every little rock in the dirt, every bit of detail I want to see pop out on the screen is gloriously there, something sadly missing from most Blu-Ray's released.Those who claim it looks no better than a DVD are simply fooling themselves. The difference was almost Night and Day for me, especially after comparing the two formats, even upconverted.If it hadn't been that I happen to work at a video store and could take the Blu-Ray home to see for myself, I wouldn't have bothered buying it going by what the people on here and other sites have said.

Gladiator is one of the grandest movies.  The places that this movie takes you is almost like you are there.  The fight scenes were very real and dramatic.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1XPB0BO0UYEMX	Samtertainment Critics Society	Gladiator is my first ever DVD, and I can't think of a better way to start &quot;DVDing&quot;. The soundtrack happens to be also my favorite CD, with memorable songs that complement perfectly the feel of the movie. The movie starts off in 180 A.D., in the finale of the wars in Germania. Russell Crowe is Maximus, the legendary General who wins the war for Rome and its caesar, Marcus Aurelius. Aurelius is old and has to choose a heir to the throne; but, instead of choosing his own son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix in an excellent performance) he decides to elect Maximus as his succesor. This isn't seen well, obviously, by Commodus, who kills his father before he's made his decision public (Maximus had made it clear that he would refuse, anyway) and proclaimes himself new Emperor of Rome. Maximus doesn't support this new Imperator, and Commodus orders him and his family to be killed. The attempt on Maximus fails (else we wouldn't have a story), but his family's killed, and he vows revenge. After burying his wife and son, he's so beaten that a group of slave traders easily captures him, converting him subsequently into a gladiator. His combat skills are so good, he soon becomes a superstar among gladiators and is sent back to Rome, to fight in the Coloseum. He's in Rome, so is the Emperor...you can imagine what comes next. Although the movie's a little too novelesque at times, its all done so well that you can't do anything but like this movie. The bonus features of this DVD will entertain you on their own, even without the movie itself. All in all, its a great buy.	5.0	&quot;What you do in life, echoes in eternity.&quot;	2000-11-21	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AP0R9UZK7W5UB	Sandra L. Rigas	Gladiator is a richly textured, well-written, and most of all truly spectacular film, powered by Russell Crowe's superb, Oscar-winning performance. Filled with epic battles, striking scenery, and first-rate acting, Gladiator is certainly not to be missed.The story begins in Germania, where the Roman Army is preparing to vanquish the last of the barbaric tribes there. The opening battle scene is a harrowing, masterfully crafted piece of work, thanks to fine editing, brilliant cinematography, and of course, Hans Zimmer's excellent music. The battle footage is dark, vivid, and grisly, bringing out the horrors of war in a truly gripping fashion. The film shifts to a camp after the battle, and two of the most crucial scenes in the movie take place here, involving Commodus, Maximus, and the emperor Marcus Aurelius, who is also the father of Commodus. After Marcus Aurelius names Maximus his succesor, Commodus kills his father and has Maximus arrested. Yet the general manages to dispatch his executioners and is taken with a slave caravan and is sold to Proximo, a slave owner. After winning battles in Africa, the group travels to Rome.... and you can guess the rest.Crowe's performance is so good really because of his charisma, the way he looks and speaks. His powerful screen presence enables him to capture the audience's attention, and Maximus is really a character you can root for. Joaquin Phoenix is convincing and in telligent as Commodus, having an authoritative, commanding presence. The fact that Commodus has done and tried to do such sick and evil things makes you really hate him. Roger Ebert said that a quirkier actor might have been more fun in the role. But if there was, you probably wouldn't be able to hate Commodus as much. The old pros Jacobi, Reed, and Harris are all great, but Reed stands out in the trio, giving a splendid performance and since he appears in the film longer, his character is fleshed out more. Nielsen is fine as Commodus' sister Lucilla.Ridley Scott's direction is well done, keeping the story moving along at a reasonable pace. (My only complaint: What the heck is some cheesy fart joke doing in this film?!) The screenplay is full of memorable lines and keeps everything in a classic tradition. John Mathieson's cinematography is terrific, with breathtaking shots and exquisite lighting. I really like how most of the beginning sequences are dismal and gray, and the scenes in Rome are sunny and bright, (Maximus says that Rome is the light). The production design is elaborate and and Rome is visually stunning, thanks to some seamlessly crafted computer work. Hans Zimmer's score is terrific and diverse, at some points rousing and at others somber, overall extremely effective and beautiful.  The battle scenes are dazzlingly shot and edited, the standout being where Maximus and his fellow gladiators battle Roman charioteers. Still the others are eye-popping, graphically impressive pieces of work. And the ending is unforgettable.Overall, in my opinion Gladiator was the best film of the year and is a powerhouse, tour-de-force film spectacle.	5.0	Strength and Honor	2001-07-22	14	11	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2NE94SMWN9DAJ	S Arnold	Before I could write this review, I had to view Gladiator a second time to be sure I was being fair to the movie.  In all honesty, this is a slick production and the DVD was excellent.  Unfortunately the story was so lame and the acting so weak that the best I could rate it was 2 stars, primarily for the quality of the picture and the extras.The characters are one-dimensional (which is not a pan on any of the actors, you can only perform what's written).  The story is worse than weak, it is not believable.  At least in Ben Hur, there is an explanation as to how the character becomes a galley slave and then later wins his freedom.  In Gladiator, Rome's greatest general becomes a slave, then a gladiator who later fights in Rome and no one wonders what happened to him and why the transformation.If you want to view a great &quot;Gladiator&quot; DVD, check out Spartacus, it doesn't have nearly as much action but the story has some substance and the characters are much better acted.  If you are interested in a period piece, I would suggest Ben Hur.I have only bought two DVDs without seeing the movie first.  Gladiator is one of the two and I am now firmly convinced that I will never purchase another DVD without seeing it first.

Needless to say, I recommend saving your money and spending it elsewhere. Heck, gambling it away on lottery tickets may garner a more quantifiable return than the visual mess contained on this disc. It seems the technicians went on holiday and left the Blu-ray conversion process to the interns; that, or the studio had a lens filter on loan from Janice Dickenson. Every single prior review is precisely accurate regarding the dismal toll DNR and EE have taken on what could have been a cinematic pleasure. To use an analogy; it's like living in the monkey house. After a while, one becomes acclimated to the terrible smell of dung, to such an extent one no longer notices the pungent odor. Whoever remastered Gladiator to this poor excuse for ""Blu-ray"" must have been so accustomed to seeing the same fuzzy and distorted images, they were incapable of realizing what a gratuitous and utterly worthless product they developed."	1.0	Seemingly no point to this gratuitous release	2010-04-26	12	11	1

This is a brilliant work or historical fiction, with excellent acting, a decent plot, engaging characters and incredible spectacle.  Those factors make up a completely enjoyable film which sucks you in and leaves you wanting more at the end.  Period.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2BC5INKLERWUT	Scott Lester	Gladiator is a one-of-a-kind movie, not to be missed for ANYTHING!!! Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix put on a tale of epic proportions. Two men desperately struggle for power as they try to tear each other to apart. Ridley Scott and crew do an outstanding job in recreating the shear power of the Roman empire and it's beginnings to an end. Connie Nielsen is stuck rite in the middle of the intense rivalry, brothering Phoenix and loving Crowe.Maximus (Crowe), the loved general, is finished with war in Germania as his valiant army finishes off the last of the opposing threat. Maximus seeks a peaceful return home to his farm, where he left his wife and son 4 years ago. Times change as the current emperor passes onward into Alesium. Phoenix orders the death of Maximus and his family. To bad only part of his wish is carried out as Maximus escapes just in time to see the aftermath of his family's death. Forced into slavery Maximus becomes a basically a target for killing in the arena. Maximus does not stay in the arena for long. The new emperor has decieded to host a series of games in his late father's honor. Maximus is flushed right into the center of Rome, where he gains the peoples respect. Using that as his only defense from Phoenix killing him, Maximus manages to become the Savior Of Rome.Gladiator is a force not to be reckoned with. As each second passes a chill will race down your spine and then a warmth will race back up it, as you are thrown into the sand of the Colleseum. Scott, Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen all names known widely now because of this one spectacular feature.	5.0	Simply, the best ever	2001-09-08	1	1	0

The acting is one dimensional, the story is not original (but drawn out and plain boring) and when you watch this film see if you really care about Crowes character. The answer will be NO.I gave it 2 stars because it was mildly entertaining. However NOT oscarworthy!!!Do yourself a favor. For the real story see SPARTACUS instead.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1NRHJW5X9COX	Scrivener	I saw this movie five years ago.  It was called  *Braveheart*.  (And it wasn't much better than this tripe.)There's so much to dislike, I'm not even sure where to commence.  OK, the music.  Laughably portentous rot by someone named Hans Zimmer.  Tragic violins.  Arabesque singing.  World Beat bongos.  The idea was to elevate the sophomoric material.  It failed.Number two -- the notions of the Roman Empire.  The screenwriters seem to think that Senators were, rather like Hillary Clinton, ELECTED by ballots to their posts.  This made me chuckle.  A sad-looking Derek Jacobi, in a conversation with Joaquin Phoenix, proclaims at one point that the Senate, as opposed to the Emperor, is CHOSEN by the  &quot;people&quot;.  May I interrupt? -- No.  They were not.  It was a hereditary right.  Speaking of the people:  where are they?  I've never seen a movie where the populace is discussed so much without actually getting to KNOW any members of said politic body.  Perhaps the gladiators are meant to stand in for the  &quot;people&quot;.  If this was the screenwriters intent, they are again wrong.  Gladiators were celebrities, usually beginning their career as captured prisoners of war or common felons.  Hardly representative of the Roman  &quot;people&quot;.  At any rate, the movie's ideas of the Roman people are obtuse.  The word  &quot;mob&quot;  is given quite a workout.  Again, Derek Jacobi:  &quot;He  (meaning Commodus)  will give them DEATH . . . and they will LOVE him for it,&quot; re:  the apparent resumption of the gladiatorial spectacles.  This a rather sweeping statement.  If true, why's Commodus a bad guy?  Hell, he's giving them what they want.  The movie seems to believe that the Senate would represent the  &quot;people&quot;  better than the Emperor.  In other words, the screenwriters don't know from Imperial Rome.  The Roman Senate, from its inception, was a venal, aristocratic body who lived off the labor of Rome's slaves and poor tradesmen.  Julius Caesar was killed by SENATORS because he wanted to reform some of these indignities.  But the screenwriters believe that Rome's Senate musta been like the USA's Senate.  At last check, our Senators haven't owned slaves since the 1860's.Number three -- the story.  Or what there is of it.  Synopsis:  *Braveheart*.  If ya seen that hullabaloo, you don't gotta see  *Gladiator*.Number four -- performances.  Russell Crowe looks mightily unhappy.  Heck, the dude's grim even before his family gets hanged 'n' burnt to a fine crisp.  All the  &quot;Oscar&quot;  talk in these many Amazon reviews is wishful thinking, because not only did he get into some fisticuffs with Matt Damon but he also violated America's Sweetheart.  In other words, Hollywood don't like him.  He was better in  *L.A. Confidential*, anyway.  Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius and Oliver Reed as Proximo bring in some of the old professionalism and canniness.  Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus is an unplayable part, so the disastrous result is not really his fault.  The screenwriters saddle the Emperor with Freudian hang-ups.  It's the same old song.  Daddy doesn't love me . . . blah blah.  Who cares.  Not only that, Mr. Phoenix steals from Ralph Fiennes'  Amon Goeth in  *Schindler's List*.  At one point, he even says of himself  &quot;Commodus the merciful . . .&quot; -- recalling the scene where Schindler tries to persuade Fiennes to not be such a wacko.  Well, that's typical of this movie's lack of originality.Number five -- the production.  Dusty browns and reds.  Also, unaccountably, a stainless-steel blue atmosphere when we first see Rome guaranteed to make you squint your eyes.  Same applies for the first battle scene in Germania.  Dark blues and blacks.  Not much is visible; you gotta take the victory on faith.  The Germania scene was done better in  *Braveheart*, anyway.  Also, the gladiatorial fights are, as one reviewer wisely pointed out, done in the manner of an Oliver Stone production:  the camera whizzes around, shakes, convulses into time-elapse . . . all the modern goodies.  I think there were tigers in the ring at one point, but the camera wouldn't sit still long enough for me to be sure.  I'll take Kirk fighting against the net-and-trident dude in  *Spartacus*  on any given Sunday.This movie sux.	1.0	Gee willikers, I hate to rain on everyone's parade, but --	2001-01-20	27	8	19
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A24DBUIAWDQXA2	S. C. Smith	I watched this for the third time wondering if it deserved its popularity and rave reviews.  It really does.  The cinematography deserves five stars by itself.  There are some of the most awe-inspiring visuals here that I have ever seen.  And the more you watch it,  the better it gets because you can really pay attention to the detail of the scenery.  Then comes the great story line.  It was just good writing and scripting.  The characters are all very interesting and likeable and pitiful.  Joaquin Phoenix put on a performance that is probably the envy of many actors.  And of course Russell Crowe is great to cheer for.  I don't think there is quite perfection here,  but I have yet to see a film that is perfect.  In many ways,  this one comes close.And for the DVD,  this is also a great adaption to DVD.  There are some great special features here.  Probably too much for the casual viewer,  but for the big fans that want to dig deep there is a bunch of good stuff here.

This is Scott's best, Crowes best, Phoenixes best, and Harris steals every scene he is in (even though they are few).  The action is amazing, from the opening grand scale battle to the climatic showdown between Maximus and Comadus (lets not forget the incredible chariots sequence) the action is just the greatest (though of course its not like the matrix, but just as good none the less because its traditional swordplay done phenomenally).  The story is deep, the performances are superb all around, the cinematography is sweeping, the visuals are great, the score is unforgettable, the action is... well i covered that, its powerful and stunning.  This is film making at its best, in everyway.  One of the best films ever made, right there next to Braveheart and LOTR.  I recommend Troy, Braveheart, and The Last Samurai if you like this because they are both just as magnificant, but if you have any taste DONT SEE ROB ROY because its a disgrace to true hero films like this and Braveheart.  The extras are great too, can you believe they were gonna have Maximus fight a rhino, that would have been so freakin awesome, too bad they didnt put it in the movie.	5.0	Forget Spartacus.	2004-09-25	1	0	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AIE80KMNGXL5Y	Sean McCormick	Watching this movie in the theatre inspired me to take an impromptu trip to Rome, and seeing it again on DVD just reinforced what a tremendous movie it is.  There are excellent performances by Russell Crowe, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris to compliment a strong screenplay and a beautiful score.  The character of Maximus is surprisingly well developed in a subtle and very satisfying way; his relationship with his family and the grief he suffers over them is better developed in a few minutes than many movies manage in hours (The Patriot comes readily to mind).  Every shot is beautiful, and the movie does a wonderful job of recreating the feel of the period, with wonderful recreations not just of Rome but of the Roman world.  Throw in a jaw-dropping opening battle that stands as one of the great movie openings of all time (and is the first movie to accurately recreate a Roman fortified camp) and you have a fantastic movie.  Evidently I'm not alone in thinking so, as when I was at the Colisseum, every tour guide I overheard was fielding questions about how accurate the scenes were in Gladiator.  I can't think of any higher praise than that.	5.0	The best Roman era movie ever made	2000-11-27	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A321HL4JXM8GRW	Sean T. Carnathan	A wonderful film.  Russell Crowe plays the great general, Maximus, who is sentenced to execution after the failing Caesar, Marcus Aurelius, chooses him to govern the empire rather than his son, who is morally unfit for the job.  His son takes the news poorly, and takes steps to ensure he succeeds his father.  Maximus escapes his executioners, but ends up enslaved and sold to an ex-gladiator (Oliver Reed) who now sends men into the pits to fight as their owner.  Crowe is terrific, Reed turns in a solid, workmanlike performance (in his last role, he died during the filming and at least the last scene he is in was a neat bit of computer/camera trickery).  An unapologetically violent film with the trademark Ridley Scott atmospheric direction.  A must see.	5.0	Terrific	2001-01-15	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3AZNVQF08QUMR	"Sean ""welshronin"""	What an outstanding movie!  The acting, story and choreographed fight scenes were excellent.  Russel Crowe has proven himself to be one of the greatest actors of our time with this superb performance.  My highest praise goes to this movie, though, not for the aforementioned points, but for the portrayal of a man with honor and integrity, willing to die for what is right, for his country and for his honor.  This seems lacking in our society today and it was refreshing to see such a great portrayal of the Roman Warrior Ethic (which is historically accurate).  This will be required viewing for my children in a few more years.The violence is too much for pre-teens, but I believe it is necessary to accurately and powerfully tell the story of the times in which it is told.	5.0	Strength and Honor	2001-01-13	1	1	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1PXRD4G9YNN9C	Seth Gecko	Somewhere in Ridley Scott's grandly engineered epic, hammered on and tinkered with by a horde of writers and rewriters, is a flesh-and-blood story that gets lost in all the bread and circuses.Crowe plays Maximus, the most-trusted general serving the aging Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), leading troops into battle against Germania in 180 A.D. But Marcus Aurelius wants Maximus to fight a tougher opponent -- the corruption of Rome -- by taking power after the emperor's death and restoring the republic. Maximus is reluctant, preferring to return to his wife and son, but he agrees to serve his Caesar. But his Caesar doesn't last too long, thanks to Marcus Aurelius' snotty son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who kills Daddy and takes the throne - and orders Maximus and his family executed. Maximus escapes, only to be captured by slave traders who train him as a gladiator. Maximus gets a chance at revenge on Commodus when his owner/promoter, Don King, er, Proximo (Oliver Reed), gets Maximus the big gig at the original Caesar's Palace - the Colosseum. Maximus is a hit with the crowd, setting him against Commodus in a battle for the hearts and minds of Rome.Gladiator is pretty to watch but doesn't have enough plot to be a Roman epic (and what plot it has is pinched from Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus), and too much plot to be an action movie (even with the 2-1/2 hour running time). A few things get muddled in the course of things, like the relationship between Commodus' sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and Maximus (or, Lucilla's relationship with Commodus), and some intrigue with the Senate (led by Derek Jacobi, who knows his way around a toga after starring in &quot;I, Claudius&quot;). Also, there is the distraction of Phoenix, who plays Roman villainy like a very weak John Malkovich.As far as the DVD itself goes - It's awesome - Better than the movie itself. Presented in an anamorphic 2.35:1 transfer, the visual presentation found on the Gladiator: Signature Collection is an almost flawless recreation of the film as I saw it theatrically. The jerky visuals of the war sequences come across as faithfully as the polished exteriors in Rome. The varying degrees of color saturation are rendered amazingly well, from the drab, washed out exteriors in Germania to the earthy tones of Zucchabar, and the vibrant cityscape of Rome. The print is almost completely free from any debris or other imperfections, and appears to have suffered only very slight edge enhancement in a few scenes, making for a wonderfully clean, sometimes polished, but always film-like image. The DVD includes a full-length audio commentary by Director Ridley Scott, Editor Peitro Scalia, and Director of Photography John Matieson. This is a great commentary track that appeals to the more technically oriented film fan. The topics range from Scott's views on historical accuracy, to motivating the actors, to the challenges of making a film of this nature, and more.There is also a section aptly titled From the Cutting Room Floor. Included here are 11 deleted scenes, playable with or without commentary by Director Ridley Scott, that range from 30 seconds to 4 minutes. The 2.35:1 non-anamorphic scenes look quite nice, but have obviously not been through the same postproduction processing as the main feature. In addition to the deleted scenes, there is a 7-minute montage of deleted snippets of footage that is accompanied by the music of Hans Zimmer...this is, for all intents and purposes, a music video. The Making of Gladiator is a 25-minute feature that is pretty much the typical &quot;cable television promotional making of&quot; that we've all come to know and love. The use of Zimmer's music throughout this featurette lends a certain charm to the piece that some similar programs lack...and if nothing else, the antics and charisma of Russell Crowe make this one worth watching even if such material isn't normally to your liking. A nice, and somewhat surprising inclusion is the 50-minute TLC program Gladiator Games: Roman Blood Sport - Very informative. Along with other very cool extras, this DVD is simply a must purchase.	2.0	Style over Substance	2000-12-15	6	5	1

Maximus(crowe)leader of the roman army led the opening battle against the goths(early germanic tribe). His great leadership puts him up for the seat as the emporer of rome, but before he can decide, the emporer's son kills the emprorer making him the immeadiate heir. He orders Maximus to be put to death but Maximus escapes and gets put in to a gladiator sept.The movie is very historically correct with nothing historians could criticize.

Cinematography, art direction, costumes . . . everything visual about this film is dead-on.  Unfortunately the movie too often slips into passages of such extremely grotesque violence that my enjoyment of the film was diminished.  Also distracting is a storyline which lacks depth and originality.This is not a bad film by any means.  It is certainly an accurate depiction of what life may have been like for a Roman Gladiator.  I'm just not sure it's something I needed to see in such gory detail.The true gem in this film, along with superior visuals, is the amazing performance of Joaquin Phoenix.	3.0	Despite Spectacle, Gladiator is NOT for Everyone.	2001-01-02	12	7	5
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3E8N6IGU9JW4L	Shankar Sengupta	I loved everything about the movie - but I will mention a few highlights that I found truly enjoyable.I loved the acting in the movie - Joaquin Phoenix puts on a show and is extremely convincing even when the plot gets unreasonably melodramatic at the end. And Connie Nielsen as the frightened mother and sister embroiled in palace intrigue is unforgettable. Ofcourse, Russell Crowe deserves every accolade heaped on him.What impressed me most about the DVD (and movie) was the soundtrack. From the opening sequence to the last, the music was simply mesmerising. Note how the music shifts moods and genre in keeping with the sequences playing out on the screen. Watching the hour-long special on the music and its composer on the accompanying second disc is a must.The quality of sound was amazing - I could have sworn I heard a horse neighing in my front-yard as Aurelius was conversing with Maximus in his tent after the battle!!The little touches to the script, to portray reality 2000 years ago, are admirable. The sewage issues being discussed in the Senate, the bloodthirstiness of the crowds at the Colisseum, the adoration for the gladiators, were all deftly portrayed without ever getting to be a heavy dose in history.Finally, the movie makes one realise why Rome was the greatest civilisation in Europe (inspite of its culture of arena violence and its deviation from the original political ideal that Maximus fights to restore) when the rest of the continent was dark and sinister.	5.0	Sound, Music and Other Thoughts	2001-01-09	3	3	0

Pheonix is also really good, he plays his sadistic character with gusto, and if you know anything about the history of the Caesars you know they were usually stark raving mad....as for Harris, he was just an acting icon, and he steals every scene he is in.  The film itself is beautiful, whatever you think of Ridley Scott as a director, he does know how to shoot a visually spectacular film, the openning battle scene is fabulous.  This is an action packed winner, I really don't know anyone who did not like this film in some way and most loved it.	4.0	MAXIMUM MAXIMUS	2006-03-08	6	4	2

The Dvd offers spectacular bonus features and a host of interesting deleted scenes.Ridley Scott has succeded, once again, in bedazzling moviegoers with his vision and flair for effects. This is the best movie he has directed since Blade Runner back in the 80's. He has seen to it that the DVD is as special as possible. Further, this movie is also priced quite reasonably. It could easily have been the type of new release that one could have found priced at 35.00 or more - and people would likely have paid. This is a film not to be missed.	5.0	A film not to be missed..	2000-12-14	5	5	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2RL9JHYNEJ1QR	"SH in Tampa ""SPH"""	Gladiator is a big budget film with great actors and amazing special effects that falls just short of the mark.Russels Crowe is one of my favorite actors and I was hoping that he would come out swinging in this movie.  Unfortunately, he did a far better job as a psychotic in Virtuosity or a mean cop in LA Confidential.  Unlike Mel Gibson in Braveheart, he does not carry the role of an inspiring leader credibly.  His impassioned speeches lack punch and you never build up enough respect or empathy with his character for him to have sufficient emotional appeal.  Part of it was bad dialog and part of it was his raspy voice (he sounds better when he tries to be menacing than he does trying to be grandiose).One area that is hard to fault are fanastic visual effects.  Each scene is well conceived and laid out beautifully.  The fight sequences are superbly choreographed and exhilarating to watch.  Too bad there are so many interuptions between them.One area that they apparently skimped on the budget was the script.  It appears that they just recycled the Braveheart script with some minor updates.  One of the driving forces behind Russell Crowe's character is his desired to avenge his wife and son.  In Braveheart this was an effective device because you got to know his bride beforehand.  However, this portion of Gladiator was rushed and ineffective ... leaving the rest of the movie a little dry and unmoving.Overall, you will spend a lot of time bored during this movie waiting for the next great fight.For those that like the film, the DVD is a pretty good buy.  The commentaries are interesting if you want to know how the film was conceived and the two additional features are more than the standard pre release commercials, they actually talk about some of the more interesting aspects of the movie.	3.0	Braveheart visits the coliseum	2000-11-22	5	5	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2TFNT0PZ6RCZ	"Simon  H. Murray ""The Mucker"""	Ridley Scott did an amazing job here, with an equally amazing effort from cast members Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix.  If you do not know what it is about maybe you are living under a rock, this was the movie of the year when it was released.  Gladiator is a phenomenal film that portrays the Gladiators in all their guts and glory.  Within the walls of the coliseum, the final scene plays out with superb, hard-hitting drama.  This movie is not just about fighting it has other aspects to enjoy.  There is family and loyalty, and also a love interest within the story.  Epic, Surreal and Amazing eye candy for any viewer, this film is a modern day classic!

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A13IKSGDYNBNQS	S J Buck	This is a superb film from the opening battle scenes right through to the end. As it was directed by Ridley Scott this shouldn't surprise you, since he is one of the most consistent directors around.Russell Crowe takes the leading role of Maximus, a Roman General who is betrayed by the son of the Emperor and he gives a commanding performance. The authority he gives off as a Roman General is spell-binding (not to mention his impressive physical condition) and if anything I would have given best Oscar for this role rather than A Beautiful Mind. In fact its a stellar cast all round with Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings all playing good supporting roles. Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus, the treacherous son of Marcus Aurelius and Connie Neilson his sister.The cinematography and cutting is excellent, and although this was made 7 or 8 years ago now, the CGI efects still look good to this day. There are some brilliant scenes inside the Colloseum, noteably where the Tigers are released during a Gladiator fight, and during the scene involving the chariots.Although the film is nearly 2 and 1/2 hours long, you'll never be looking at your watch during this. This is what cinema and film (and I include DVDs in this as well) were meant for. There is no basis of fact behind the story, but in the end who cares this is just great entertainment.	5.0	A Roman Epic	2007-06-20	2	2	0

The film is full of action, political intrigue, and also deals with issues of love and faith.  The cast is strong, the dialogs perfectally written, and the viewer is treated to the perfect amount of gore.  You will feel you are really there without being overwhelmed by blood and guts that weren't really needed in order to get the point across.This film is truly a work of art, and it is obvious that it aimed to please.	5.0	Wow!	2003-02-04	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A55B9VCC7F2ZL	SkookumPete	[I wrote this review some years ago under an anonymous account. I'm resubmitting it so that it will show up under My Reviews, as it sums up what I think about a lot of modern movie-making.]I strongly believe that the tremendous success of this movie at the box office and the awards is tragic testimony to how the art of film-making has declined from storytelling to mere sensory stimulation. Consider: music that never lets up; reverb added to every voice, even when characters are talking out in the open; constant use of quick camera cuts to ensure that you never have a chance to study or reflect on anything; every scene keyed to the same pitch of intensity, so that there is little to distinguish a fight in a small provincial amphitheatre from the climax in the Colosseum. It's all just a barrage of noise and light calculated to keep your reptile brain stimulated while your intellect shuts down.Compare this film toSpartacus, a movie that could not be made in this era because the younger generation, overstimulated by movies like Gladiator, would consider it boring. Despite the lack of computer FX, the action scenes in the earlier movie are so much more successful because (a) they stand out against the background of long, slow, quiet plot and character development and (b) they are coherent, unlike the muddled battles and fights of Gladiator, where you don't get much of an idea of what is going on besides general mayhem.It's really sad that manipulation of the senses has become so confused with artistry. Sad because more movies like this will be made, while we get to see fewer and fewer that offer any stimulation for the higher parts of the brain.	1.0	Stimulus not storytelling	2009-12-14	17	8	9

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AMYW43AHO16SS	smoothjazzandmore	The year 2000 has to be considered one of the worst movie years in recent memory.  As far as I'm concerned, none of the films nominated for Best Picture should have won, let alone nominated.  Which brings me to Gladiator, the best picture winner of that year.  This is probably the worst movie to win Best Picture since 1947 with Gentleman's Agreement.  Don't get me wrong.  The film is exciting with its chariots scenes and fights.  Russell Crowe given the lack of competition probably deserved his Best Actor.  Joaquin Phoenix is certainly effective in his supporting role.  It's just that this film has been done before.  If you like exciting, action packed film, this is for you.  If you want to see a real Best Picture winner, try the original Ben Hur.	3.0	Not a Best Picture Oscar in my book!	2005-08-12	47	5	42

I've also observed that people who've seen &quot;Spartacus&quot; are less enamoured by &quot;Gladiator&quot; than those who've yet to experience the Kubrick sword &amp; sandal epic.  Another quibble with &quot;Gladiator&quot; is that I wished the actual fighting sequences in the coliseum weren't so disjointed and muddled.  I couldn't follow much of the fight sequences, and they made me really appreciate the talents of, say, Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan, whose choreographed action sequences are always displayed fully on the screen, sans quick-cut editing and camera trickery.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AK3R3RNUWLFJR	solar-bear	I have been of the opinion that Ridley Scott is an opportunist with no originality.  While Braveheart itself fabricates history, it is not without some enthusiastic immitators.  Ridley Scott evidently took the Braveheart forumla to heart, and his attempt to clone it is the flick Gladiator.I realize it's a matter of personal taste, but the choice of Crowe as the leading character is a poor one.  There's always something filthy and unseemly that comes through Crowe.  I can't put my finger on it, but it's a persistent problem with Crowe as far as I am concerned.Now back to Scott.  His latest venture, Kingdom of Heaven, again follows the Braveheart formula, and exploits the hatred towards Islam in the West.  An opportunist he is.	1.0	A Braveheart wanna-be.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1K8H3V5DYIVUL	Solidus	I was excited to see Gladiator, I really was.  I expected a lot from the man who gave us Alien.  Then I actually saw it and thought to myself, what a waste of money (I'm talking about the film, not my six bucks).  In the first battle, the film takes a decidedly &quot;Hollywood&quot; turn.  The battle is shot in a mixture of slow motion and blurred shots that leave everything to the imagination and leaves you hanging before the movie's hackneyed plot even begins to unfurl in its oh so predictable manor.  Compared to Braveheart, Gladiator's battles are nothing more than campy and predictable fight scenes ala John Woo films.  The acting and the characters are paper thin.  Rather than come across as a mean-spirited monarch, Juaquin Phoenix (who's bad in any movie) simply acts like a whiny baby and spends the whole movie trying to get into his sister's pants.  Russel Crowe (pure window dressing) acts like a typical Russel Crowe and spends the movie rather void of emotion.  In Ben Hur, you could see and believe the anger and fury in Charlton Heston's face when he was framed by his best friend.  In Gladiator, Crowe looks like he's trying to remember whether or not he left the oven on.  The best performance in the movie by far comes from veteran actor Richard Harris.  Unfortunately, he's not in it for too long.  The film is basically a carbon copy of oscar winning epics such as braveheart.  Man loses someone close to him and is forced into a position he doesn't want to be in.  He goes up agains tremendous odds, triumphs, earns the respect of his people, and dies in the end, and right before he dies, Crowe sees a vision of his deceased family (Braveheart anyone?).  If you're looking for a good Roman epic.  Wait until March when Ben Hur comes out on DVD.	1.0	This film reeks of cheese!	2000-12-20	13	4	9
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ADEW9NW1HGTNJ	"""songbear"""	This movie is both one of the finest mainstream movies and finest DVDs ever.  The action of Ben Hur and fine writing of a great epic film screenplay combined with up-to-date, understated digital technology and a wonderful ensemble cast - this film is a  visually spectacular and sonically intoxicating.  Ridley Scott manages to put the viewer in the middle of the Roman Empire the way George Lucas hurled his viewers through outer space - but with Gladiator I didn't even suspect half of what I was seeing was digitally generated background scenery and backdrops until I saw the &quot;making of&quot; featurettes on the DVD.In addition to Russell Crowe's great performance, both Richard Harris (Camelot) as Marcus Aurelius and Joaquin Phoenix (Parenthood, 8mm) as Commodus, his son and heir to the empire, turn in Oscar worthy performances.  The late Oliver Reed (Oliver, Tommy) also does a wonderful job.  The costumes, the special effects, the cinematography, and the sound are something to be experienced at home, in DTS, on a good surround sound system.This 2 DVD set is PACKED with special features, including quite a few &quot;Making of&quot; featurettes and an interview with Hans Zimmer, the soundtrack composer.My only criticism of the film - and I am a Lone Ranger on this point - is the musical soundtrack to the film sounds to my ears like other soundtracks (Bram Stoker's Dracula, for instance) and classical pieces (Mars from the Planets by Gustav Holst) that have been thinly disguised and re-arranged by the composer.  I honestly don't know if this is coincidence or intentional, but only devout ST and classical music fans will notice this.  Thank God it doesn't detract from the film, and in some places the ST is quite effective.  It is a shoe-in for an Oscar nomination.  Sonically - the film is superb.Congratulations to the studio on the common sense to release with several different audio options - Dolby 5.1, Dolby 6.1 EX, and DTS - all on the same DVD.  Nothing more a consumer could ask for at this or any price.  Thanks.	5.0	Best ensemble cast in years!!	2000-12-14	41	34	7
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2CFDO15YU02Y2	Soseki Shikibu	Gladiator is a dark and violent tale laced with some very cool action sequences. Like Spartacus, it tries to be an old-style sweeping epic, while on the other hand, it tries to be a dark story of revenge, not unlike the very cool Conan the Barbarian. Strangely, it's not a great example of either of these things. As impressive as the scope is, the plot of Gladiator is both dull and familiar. Part of the problem is that the character of Maximus has no complexity. He's a one-note hero, a generic good guy on a noble mission. Crowe does a lot of contemptible sneering at the bad guys, but doesn't have enough material to shape a 3-dimensional persona. You never doubt that Maximus will triumph because he's clearly set up to; he lacks the even the slightest sense of depth, so there's no reason for him to be in the movie except to triumph. Another problem is that, while the action scenes are good, the rest of the picture is painfully slow. I'm talking &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; slow. Characters talk in cliches or give laborious soliloquies. I believe that it's hard to write or perform characters from Roman times because it was so far back in history; the primary source material for writers or actors feels like it comes only from other films.At its heart, Gladiator wants to be the next Braveheart. You know, the period epic that obtains a loyal legion of fans and goes on to win a handful of Oscars. The difference is that Braveheart was more strongly conceived; it knew what it was about and what it wanted to say. Gladiator, meanwhile, serves up some amazing bits of action, but begs you to take it seriously the rest of the time.	3.0	Death Wish 180 A.D	2000-12-29	1	1	0

As a computer arts major, I pride myself on being able to critique the cg, beind able to tell when they haven't used enough layers to make it the CG look real, or whether the peopl in the background aren't quite as smooth as they could be. Gladiator stuns and mazes you with not just a brillant story , but Ripley Scotts legendary amazing viewpoint and telling of Maximus' story and the landscape surrounding him- reminiscant of Bladerunner's majestic run down dark city it's run down hero, Decker.It's a movie worth it's cost and is somethign to be watched along with Spartacus and Ben Hur.

The first battle, you couldn't see what was going on in it.  Russell Crowe's character was never really challenged throughout the film.  I did think Crowe did a good job in the film.  It was to expected after standout performances in LA Confidential and The Insider.  The story just did not draw me in.  Everything looked too easy for Crowe's character (I know I am repeating myself here).  It is just disheartening when a good director and a good actor get together and they make a mediocre film.  A similar film is Braveheart.  Braveheart is a much better film than this.  That film thrust you into the battle scenes and made you care about William Wallace.  That film had heart, while this film seemed cold and distant.  I am sure Scott and Crowe will bounce back with their next projects.	2.0	Disappointing film from Ridley Scott	2000-10-18	29	3	26

Action, intrigue, romance, huge battle scenes, betrayal, vengence, and death.This was a good one.  Had a great cast.  Russel Crowe played Maximus.  A general,  turned prisoner, turned slave, turned gladiator, turned hero of the Roman Empire.  Richard Harris played the Roman Empereor whom  Maximus was a general under, and who was like the son, whom he wished his son was like.  Joiquan Phoenix, played the Emperors son who killed his father when he found out his father was going to make Maximus Emperor instead of him, and then he orders Maximus killed.Maximus gets away, but not in time to save his wife and son from being murdered by the same men he had been in control of when he was General.  He is sold into slavery, and becomes a Gladiator, and vows revevge on the new Emperor.Oliver Reed, in his final performance before his death, plays the owner of the Gladiators.  He agrees to give Maximus his freedom, if he can get the crowds to love him and see him as a hero.  This is how Maximus keeps the Emperor from killing him.  The Emperor will not kill him since he is so loved, 'cause that would make Maximus a martyr, so he has to find a way for the people to either hate him, or have him die &quot;fairly&quot; in the Gladiator ring.  That's all I'm going to tell about the story, because I don't want to give anything away.  This is one you need to see in the theater.  This picture is great.THE GOODThe acting, the sets, the cinemetography, the battle at the beginning was excellent, the fight scenes, the ending.THE BADNothing, though some people may not like the length.  But as I have said before, you're getting more for your money.THE BOTTOM LINEGreat movie.  Go see at least once if not more.  And definitely see it at least once in the theater.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3GFE7PHP2GHDA	Stefan	This is the good remastered version. It has all the items listed in other reviews that indicate it is the new remaster.Some indicators:It seems the only definitive way to tell if you have the new version is to look at the innermost rings on the underside of Disc One itself. Hold it up to the light, and at the end of a string of letters and numbers, you should see &#34;B1R2.This version has that code.In addition a review I read somewhere said you can tell by the title screen at the beginning. I can't find that review now, but I did a comparison at the time and this &#34;Gladiator [Blu-ray] (2013)&#34; had the title as described.Looks very good.	5.0	Gladiator [Blu-ray] (2013)	2013-03-25	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2VUOO5RVB78A7	Stephanie Sandlin	Gladiator Extended Edition.First, if you are considering this DVD and you don't have DTS ignore all the whining by the DTS crowd. While its disappointing it is not there. It doesn't destroy the set. Especially, keep in mind the majority of us don't have 1000 dollar audio setups to enjoy the DTS sound. Its a minority all in a hoot on this one.As for the film - its a improvement. Many have said it, so I'll be succinct. The added character development (Lucilla, Politics, Proximo and Commadus' scene in the basement) all augment the characters wonderfully.So, without recycling other viewpoints? If you are a fan of this film, more than likely you'll find the Extended Edition enjoyable as well.  It takes what you saw in theatrical release and adds a layer or two in spots. Thats a welcome addition to me.Only downside - if this was to augment the original DVD release why include the theatrical release again? Space used for the Theatrical release could've been use more wisely. They should've just made this Extended Edition only.Other than that, great movie - added scenes for the most part add to my enjoyment of the film.	5.0	***** for Extended Version / *** 1/2 for DVD release	2005-11-17	17	15	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2C4YFKN0Q81AY	Stephen A. Browne	When I first saw the battle scene and heard the battle cry of the Germania barbarians, I had to replay that scene a couple of times to make sure of what I was hearing. I thought that somehow a soundtrack from another movie made in 1964 had been accidentally included with this film. The 1964 movie I'm referring to is called &quot;Zulu&quot; and is based on an actual battle in January of 1879 between British troops and Zulu warriors in South Africa.So based upon this &quot;historically inaccurate&quot; event, what are we to deduce? That the Zulu nation of 1879 used the same war cry as the Germanic tribes of 180 A.D. because they were somehow descendents and migrated from North Central Europe to South Africa?I wonder if the same people responsible for this gaffe had worked on &quot;Zulu&quot;, if they would have had the Zulu warriors yelling &quot;Banzai&quot;?&quot;Gladiator&quot; was OK. I probably had preferred that Commodius had been dispatched as he actually had been from the historical point of view, and that Maximus had escaped, been reunited with his army and returned to Rome to battle Quintus and then found out he had been cheated out of his revenge with Commodius.Another point between &quot;Zulu&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot; - in 1964 there were no computer enhancements done for &quot;Zulu&quot;. What you saw was real, not digitally done to show the overwhelming force of Zulu warriors. Also the battle scenes were more &quot;stable&quot;....shot in real time....not done in 3 different speeds then spinning from here to there and back again.	2.0	Six Degrees of Historical Separation	2000-12-19	14	7	7

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AWFDFLR1DA23A	stephen Garry	When Gladiator came out at the cinema i didnt go and see it at the pictures as there was too much hype and i didnt think that it would live up to its expectations.  A friend recently bought it on dvd and talked me into watching it and i  have to say that it knocked me for six.  I wish that i had watched Gladiator on the big screen as its a fantastic film, with some excellent fight scenes.  Russell Crow (Maximus) plays his part with unpresidented pride and makes the character come to life.  Gladiator is a film that you should own(i do now) as its one you watch over and over again as the quality of it is so good and there are also loads of extras on the dvd.	5.0	Worth All Of The Hype	2001-04-11	7	3	4

So I held off buying it until i figured they had worked out the bugs. The bugs being the not so good transfer of the film into the bluray format. I bought it when i heard it was all set and received it and checked the indicators that it was the newer edition distributed by WB. The picture quality on about 60% was high quality while many of the scenes had a heavy grain accompanied by specs of blinking small lights. It was enough to be very much noticeable. Im not going to send it back because i doubt they will com out with another for sometim and im content with the way it is right now.	3.0	RUMORS	2013-01-30	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AWY56V0LIB3P	Stephen McLeod	I kept waiting for this movie to get better.  Alas.  Each chunky scene in this self-conscious, overweight &quot;virtual&quot; spectacle just sort of drops out of the sky, connected by only the thinnest conceit, to what precedes it and what comes after.  There's a feeling after a very short while into the film, that it might never end.  The screenplay, its characters, the actors who portray them are entirely gratuitous, and serve no purpose than to justify the choreographed violence that takes up two thirds of this very long film.  This is a movie that Ridley Scott made because he could, not because he should.  The whole thing seems designed merely to show off the (art) director's flamboyant, and shamelessly artificial vision of a high-tech antiquity.  The plot is nonsense.  Why is our hero allowed to live past the first thirty minutes of this movie, for example?  The digitalized cinematography is gaudy and overwrought.  The actors are boring and the dialog is stiff where it's not plain cheesy.  I bought this movie.  I don't recommend even renting it.	2.0	Arch, adolescent camp	2000-12-05	21	7	14

The musical score accentuates your emotions and leaves you mesmerized and emotionally drained at the end of the film.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	I'm not here to give my opinions of plot and acting.  My book report days ended years ago.  Only the quality of the film on blu ray means anything to me and you can decide whether you like the actual film on  your own.Disc one has both the theatrical release ,which Ridley Scott claims is the Director's cut ,  as well as the Extended version with plenty of additional footage.  I have both the original SD release and the Sapphire SD releases and this 2 disc set takes the cake for video transfer quality.  Deep dark blacks and rich hues even in muted scenes.  Really quite excellent.The audio is DTSHD lossless audio but often the score itself seems to envelope the foley effects of the action which occurs in too many spots to specify.  Never the less, the audio sounds great on my fairly esoteric audio system.The 2nd disc contains more extras than you might want to watch in one sitting.  While the letters on the back of the disc are simply too small for me to read, I ordered the disc from Amazon about 1 month ago and just got to it today.  I have watched the Gladiator many times and always enjoy it. One of these days I will travel to Pompei myself.  In the meantime, be assured that the quality of the Sapphire Edition of Gladiator is well worth it.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks	5.0	Gladiator-Sapphire Series on Blu Ray	2012-06-21	5	4	1

Exciting fight sequences, cutting-edge special effects, and breathtaking performances help to take the viewer back to the Roman era, a time of both intolerable cruelty and technological advancement. The film is truly the masterpiece of Sir Ridley Scott!The new DVD release has a great host of special features, including a 200-Minute Making-of Documentary. But, best of all, the DVD features two versions of the film: the 155-Minute Theatrical Cut, and the 171-Minute Extended Cut. Both versions are given terrific sound and picture quality!

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3SUMZCZOMTLSI	Steven J. Greenwald	This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies of all time. I am totally shocked that Ridley Scott directed it, since he is one of my favorite directors (e.g., Alien, Bladerunner). ...Some of the moronic things about this horrible movie that drove me up a tree follow.The opening scene shows the Romans using something akin to napalm against their enemies. I thought napalm was invented by Dow Chemical in WWII! The main character rides from Germany to the Mediterranean coast of Spain on a horse - in one day. Did you know that tigers live in Africa? The Roman gladius (the sword they used) could not be used for hacking only for stabbing due to its fragility because of the metallurgy of that day. A Roman emperor entering the Colliseum to fight a gladiator??? Sure. Reed gives a truly horrible and cadaverous (fittingly I guess since he died during production) performance. There are continuous nauseous flashback sequences of Crowe's son that made me ill. There's absolutely no evidence that Marcus Aureleus decided to make anyone other than Comodus emperor!Did I mention that the plot is totally boring and predictable, being a typical Hollywood formula with no surprises?The only good thing in this movie was the historically accurate reproduction of the Colliseum. I admit to being impressed with that.For the rest of the movie: feh! I'd give it no stars were that possible.This loathsome movie could only appeal to morons who have no grasp of history, plot, acting, geography (I still can't get over those tigers in Africa), or metallurgy, and who have taken a dramamine to combat the nauseous flashback scenes.	1.0	Fodder for Morons	2001-06-19	23	4	19

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3U56M0Y8LYO6J	"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict"""	"It is strange that Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" is the one film he has directed that was honored with the Academy Award for Best Picture.  It is strange because of all the films he has made, ""Gladiator"" is easily one of his more mediocre efforts.  Hopefully, future film-historians will not consider this the apex of his noteworthy career.A general named Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a favorite of dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After he spectacularly triumphs in a vital military campaign, Marcus names him protector of Rome. But the general is betrayed and left for dead by Marcus' son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), after he learns his father has decided to not bestow upon him the mantle of leadership.  Maximus, however, manages to escape his executioners and winds up becoming a gladiator in North Africa.  Under the mentorship of Proximo (Oliver Reed), Maximus fights his way up the competitive ranks and becomes a beloved figure among the public.  His celebrity soon brings him into contact with Commodus and gives the wronged warrior an opportunity for revenge.""Gladiator"" is a mixed bag from start to finish.  Every positive to the film is muted by a negative.  The action sequence that opens the film is good but the gladiatorial battles that follow are average.  The special effects work done with Oliver Reed's stand-in is impressive but the special effects work done with the computer-generated tiger is horrible.  Even the acting is uneven.  Crowe, Harris, and Reed are fine but Phoenix and Connie Nielsen turn in weaker efforts.  Well, a lot of directors usually produce at least one less-than-inspired work sometime in their career and ""Gladiator"" is clearly Scott's creative hiccup.  Do yourself a favor and check out his more noteworthy works like ""Alien"" (1979), ""Thelma and Louise"" (1991), and ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001) to gain a better appreciation for the man's talents."	2.0	"""What we do in life echoes in eternity."""	2004-02-28	3	1	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2HMZNZFOZ4EL1	Stresspuppy	there are many pluses to this 2-disk set. the entire second disk is full of extras, like behind the scenes featurettes, the making of, etc. the sound is crisp as is the movie. i absolutely agree that the recreation of the Coliseum is very impressive and Ridley Scott, as he's done so often, conveys a seemless sense of style and scale. the battle sequence with the volleys of fire arrows was exceptional.i agree with some of the other reviewers that if this were strictly an action flick, i would probably rate it five stars but with the stigma of a picture of the year, i find it overrated; the story is a bit abreviated and disjointed. perhaps it's nitpicking but there is a real lack of motivation in the Russell Crowe's character: why does he fight? in fact, there is more compelling reason for him NOT to go on.'I will always serve Rome' -- well, not really. we're not given any vision of Rome except maybe for Marcus' but that was to give Rome back to the people. well, wasn't Commodus on his way to getting the mob to come around with the games? it is really unclear how badly Commodus would have ruled (there is no benchmark left by Marcus to judge) except for that one insensitive remark about the Greek quarters and that he brought back the games (ok, regicide/patricide is bad). wasn't Marcus worse by his conquests of 'barbarians' and taking over them?! Rome is the light? maybe but i'm sure the 'barbarians' would disagree. only the victors write histories.'Let me go home' -- even more reason for him not to fight. staying alive meant being apart from his family. there is no home for him among the living. sure, revenge is an issue but was that a realistic thought in the beginning?for me what kept him alive was his loyality to Marcus and his need to be able to return home. both were taken early on. he decision not to fight initially as a slave was consistent; the crowd doesn't even motivate him (killing everyone in record time and screaming 'Is this what you want?!' and throwing the sword away in disgust.)finally, the duel at the end was trite... Maximus winning despite being injured and drugged. i have a lot of problem with this, as the feeling throughout the movie was that he will never lose a fight and therefore there was no suspense or expectation. Maximus was barely hit by Commodus despite the fact that early on we see Commodus training and being quite good. (a better executed duel was the way Rob Roy ended -- it was in doubt and he won only in a desparate manner).i don't hate this film; it is a good movie but just not exceptional. the extras on the disks and the cinemtagraphy makes it worthwhile but i couldn't seriously give this five stars.	3.0	with all my heart, no...	2001-02-21	4	2	2

(Not that I think any video is worth $112, but that's another subject!) It's a shoddy video transfer-I guess the powers that be were focused exclusively on the DVD release. Thanks guys, really appreciate that. The colours are muddy and off. Check the scenes w/Marcus Aurelius watching the battle in the very beginning. In the theatre, his cloak was a glorious Imperial Purple, but here it was a dull blue-green. I watched this video on 2 seperate TV/VCR set-ups, so it wasn't the equipment. Unfortunate that while the DVD gets all the extra footage and behind the scenes stuff, those of us purchasing the video get stuck w/sub-par quality.

This movie, although extremely violent, has an awesome story that is very inspiring. It's about someone who does things for the right reason. It's interesting how throughout the whole movie our Gladiator is really a person who would rather not kill, but does so because he has to. I lived in Italy for two years and never visualized Rome as it truly was before this movie.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A18UBPBIKPQMPE	"Suppresst ""suppresst"""	"There are technical flaws, covered extensively by other Amazon reviewers, in this film contributing to its mediocrity - over reliance on computer generated  backgrounds/special effects; too many scenes filmed in dim or blue light; excitement punctuated with too long boredom. However, there are deeper and more fundamental flaws; some which ought to cause grave concern:1.) Why was this mediocre film so widely acclaimed? Perhaps it was the spectacle of Coliseum violence, violence that is one step beyond the spectacle of NFL football; violence people in American society are hankering for. Hankering for because as Americans fail to see the larger problems of society go unresolved, they long to see resolution achieved in other venues - games, contests -; resolution that allows them to imagine the violent, painful and bloody end of their enemies (for example, a liberal imaging the death of a conservative, and visa versa). The success of this film is an evil portent for where our culture may be headed.2.) Everyone should be troubled that while Hollywood finds it almost impossible to cast in the mold of a hero anyone with Christian faith, Russell Crowe in this role is depicted as a man of worth because of his faith in the gods worshipped in Rome. His strong faith in these gods is depicted as a stabilizing and grounding influence in his life, over and against his semi-crazed Emperor-antagonist. Faith also allows Crowe's character to endure the cruel treatment of his family and to hope and believe he will be rejoined in an afterlife with lost loved ones.  In light of who the Roman gods actually were, was Crowe's character's faith reasonable, or worthy of admiration? By what mechanism do the gods of Rome provide justice in an afterlife? For example, Crowe's character is sure his loved ones will go to a heavenly afterlife, partly because they were a target of evil, but the movie begins with Crowe butchering thousands of Germanic tribesmen - presumably with families themselves - which Crowe's character, and Rome, is invading as imperialist conquerors. Why is not Crowe's character ""evil"" for a lifetime of butchery as a Roman general? If Hollywood is going to cast out Christian heroes (Ben-Hur) and credibly substitute with Roman conquerors?

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2YYY1JRMNV5SJ	Tami D. Cowden	Gladiator is a wonderful retelling of the timeless story of good versus evil - of the hero who acts not for his own advantage but for the good of all.Maximus is a WARRIOR - a brilliant example of this hero archetype, a man who wants nothing more than to live happily with his own family, but is called by destiny to serve the good of the nation.When his emperor calls upon him to take the helm of the government, Maximus is reluctant and refuses, but then villain makes the choice for him, by destroying all Maximus held dear.  He is lost for a time, but his Warrior spirit will not let him succumb tot eh temptation to join in family in the Elysian fields.  He has a job to do, an empire to serve.  Only when the job is done will he have earned his rest.In short -- it's a great movie.  See it today!	5.0	A Warrior's  Mythic Journey -	2000-12-15	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3EX36SNRYD5VL	"TammyJo Eckhart ""TammyJo Eckhart"""	I happen to be an ancient historian and I find that I can best enjoy movies and films set in the ancient world if I don't expect them to be realistic.  There are many problems with this film in terms of the reality of the Roman world during the second century CE -- listing them would use up the entire word limit for reviews on Amazon.com.  However, the film itself moves rapidly, the scenery and costuming is eleborate, and the characters are interesting and well-acted.  Its good to see both veteran actors and younger ones interacting so well.  My only real complaint is that some of the filming made me a bit dizzy but then combat is a fast-paced and terrifying experience and the quick, spiraling movements did a good job of making me feel overwhelmed at times.  We're using it in the Roman History class this semester and it should generate a lot of good discussion.	5.0	"set aside ""reality"" and you can enjoy it"	2003-01-15	2	1	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3RKCSI3NKSFMF	Taryn	The first time I saw this movie, I admit, I cried at the end. The acting is spectacular and Russell Crowe was extroidinary for his role. Rome is brought alive again and the empire is not forgotten with the younger generation.  I do also compliment the soundtrack, which I also own. The music is emotional and moving. When paired with the majestic, perfectly balanced images and story line, it creates a marvel far set apart from Hollywood's usual flicks.  If ever there was a film in the modern age that is so accurate and astonishing, Gladiator is it.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AZ3ESALUSJ6JX	Ted Hitchens	This is, without a doubt, one of the most historically accurate films of all time.  I noticed some of you didn't like this movie.  The #1 complaint seems to be historical accuracy.  Someone described the tiger scene as comical. Define &quot;comical.&quot; Do you not think that they did stuff like that in the Colosseum?  As a historian by degree, I think you'd be mentally and psychologically shocked by some of the atrocities that were done in the Colosseum!  True, Commodus did NOT actually kill his father, but what some of you don't seem to realize is that the number 1 rule of filmmaking is to ENTERTAIN, not educate.  This is especially true with period films (films that take place long ago).  Although some characters were actual figures, &quot;Gladiator&quot; is NOT a true story.  Here's a common-sense rule of life: don't get your history from cinema!For the rest who enjoyed this film, I don't think we should be surprised that &quot;Gladiator&quot; is nominated for 12 Oscars, including Best Picture.	5.0	This film sets a new standard for period films.	2001-03-06	8	5	3

This is an amazing, engrossing, and brilliant film. Not since the earlier years of celluloid and such collossal cornerstones like ET, Titanic, and Star Wars has a film redefined the term epic. If you've never seen it, you have no idea what a true film experience is. I'll just leave it at that!&quot;...Are You Not Entertained??!&quot;With this said, I'll move on to my review of the DVD. In spite of the fact that attending a film at a theater doesn't really compare to home viewing (although with today's technology, it's arguable), this DVD is a treat that I didn't get when I experienced the film on it's original theater run.&quot;...on my mark, unleash hell!&quot;First of all, the extras are what I call &quot;extra extras&quot;. There are hours of REALLY interesting content. From the cute diary of the kid, to historical presentations of costumes, gladiators, and culture, to behind the scenes footage and deleted scenes, the extras really deliver.

Gladiator, on the other hand, was a disappointment in all areas. When the level of detail is taken to this extreme with DNR and EE it results in a very artificial and harsh picture. This is the case with Gladiator. So extreme is the ""scrubbing"" of this film that actual parts of the movie are missing, as reported. This is unacceptable. Any QC could have easily spotted this before production. To make matters worse, this is part of their ""Sapphire series"" which apparently means...we dont care, just give us your money you idiots.

Crowe is good and the acting is decent but the story is just too long and the action scenes are done in a choppy slow motion style that takes away from any excitment we should be feeling.  Plus the ending is a total downer.  I just love these period epics like Braveheart, Titanic and Saving Private Ryan where the filmmakers decide to kill off the hero for the sake of nobility.  This film's ending is no exception only that it has none of the impact those other films had.  This film is disappointing.

And I amafraid that I want something more than simple visual thrills( even though you get those in spades ).The movie is weakened as soon as Maximus reveals his identity toCommodus - which happens way too soon. Then the movie becomescompletely incredible from that point. Because all the Emperorwould have done on learning his old enemy was still alive ishave him killed. No one would have questioned that. He wasEmperor. He had the Praetorian Guards.

Although there are some of those &quot;I think I'm gonna hurl&quot; moments, there is a lot more to this movie. Reason #3: Ridley Scott &amp; Co. do a good job of recreating Rome as it might have been back in 180 A.D. This is a movie that, I think, will win these Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor-Russell Crowe, Best Supporting Actor-Joaquin Phoenix, Best Director-Ridley Scott, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Sound, and Best Choreography.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1NSUJJCG73IRF	"The Tweeder ""tweeder16"""	"Director:  Ridley ScottCast:  Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nelson, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou.Running Time:  155 minutesRated R for intense, graphic combat and some language.The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott (""Alien"") and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, ""Gladiator"", who is ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor"".  ""Gladiator"" chronicles the story of Maximus (played brilliantly by Oscar-winning Russell Crowe), General to frail Caesar Marcus Aurelius' Roman Army as well as a husband and father. After a victorious battle far from home, Caesar (Richard Harris) holds private court with Maximus to offer him his position after his passing. Overhearing this, Caesar's jealous and scheming son Commodus (a solid Joaquin Phoenix) guilts his father then murders him. Commodus plots to get rid of Maximus because of his lust for power and envy of his father's love for Maximus.  Maximus survives Commodus' henchmen's attack, is found near death only to be sold into slavery, loses his wife and son to murder by Commodus' minions, and becomes a very celebrated gladiator in the area.  Eventually, Maximus decides that he must kill Commodus, who is creeping along to the edge of insanity; however, Commodus thinks Maximus must die, as he believes Maximus is more popular than he.  The two enemies reveal to each other that their conflict can only resolved with a fight to the death.With a budget of over $100 million, Scott certainly delivers the goods. ""Gladiator"" transcends the notion of ""blockbuster"" that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and Ben-Hur.  Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc), but also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting; a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent occasionally may occasionally annoy, but this aside, he was well and truly up to the billing. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Connie Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who ""should have been a son"" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guards of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.  So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualize the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe.  A visually exhilarating masterpiece that is not only one of the biggest motion-picture spectacles of the decade, yet considered to be one of the most powerful as well."	5.0	Gladiator  (2000)	2006-03-01	5	5	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A30OXD42ZFYZLO	Thomas Keneally	Gladiator by Ridley Scott won a lot of awards and was praised by a number of people. It is a gritly movie, with revenge, honor, triumph and some decent acting. It is supposed to based on history of Roman empire, but much maligned. A lot of similarities exist between this movie and Braveheart. I do notice that a number of people like both movies, probably due to the similarities. It will easily appeal to people who are drawn to battle and blood sports. Like a number of recent movies, it suffers from a lack of good screenplay. The days of great epics are gone. Many have compared it to Spartacus and found this wanting. I do not concur. Spartacus had spectacular acting and screenplay. I cannot remember any of the great lines in this movie, though it had good graphics.Spartacus on the other hand had Lawrence Olivier, Peter Ustinov and Kirk Douglas give magnificent performances. Even the lines in the movie are resplendent. That movie has stood the test of the time, which I suspect this will not. People who see such movies would say this is a movie, not a documentary, so it need not be close to the truth. In the past, directors like William Wyler used to Gore Vidal to clean up the script for movies such as Ben-Hur. Nowadays, they do not bother. If something is inaccurate why bother, very few people read about the Roman empire, its rise and fall. All they want is a brief 2 hours of spectacle. I shudder to think that they go back home thinking that what they saw was the truth. This movie had a good score and decent photography, so I give it 3 stars. I can watch a few times, but it falls short of the great epics. The laughable part was an emperor fighting with a general in the arena. I do not know who came up with that, do people who see the movie stop and think for a moment how stupid that is.	3.0	Historically inaccurate, enjoyable	2005-05-26	4	2	2

Paramount needs to give those of us who purchased this a free trade-in for the re-release that's supposedly coming out that fixes this quality control problem. On cable and satellite, the broadcast version is actually the way it's supposed to look, it's true 1080p as opposed to this upscaled DVD-looking mess. I'm sorry for all of us, and very disappointed. :(  Get with the program, Paramount!UPDATED 8/28/2013: Forgot to update this!

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2EKOWTEJ1N165	tim connors	GLADIATOR  Is GLADIATOR an action movie? Is it an historical drama? Is it a sweeping epic? Yes. This movie really makes you think, unlike other movies of its kind where all you do is sit there and ponder who is going to die next. Like BRAVEHEART, this is a story of a brutal era told with realism. This is a violent movie that shows  our appetite for violence.  This is the kind of movie that I love the most, one that leaves me with so much to say about it that I could write a book. If you havent seen Gladiator go see it, if you have do yourself a favor and buy it on VHS or DVD.  You are really missing out if you dont.  This is the kind of movie that movies were invented for.  In AD 180, the death of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius leaves a void at the height of Roman rule. Aurelius had told Maximus (played by Crowe) who is Rome's greatest general, that he, Maximus, should hold the emperor's power in trust after the ruler's death until the Imperial Senate can take the position of command. Aurelius relied on Maximus because he is a simple soldier, unskilled at lying and uncorrupted by politics. And Maximus, who loved the emperor like a father, agreed, but even said that all he really wanted was to go home to his wife and his young son. But the emperor's son, Commodus , takes control before Maximus even knows the emperor is dead, and the son has very different plans for the empire than his father did. He wants to save Rome from the politicians so he can rule Rome. Maximus escapes his own execution and then is captured by slavers and trained gladiator in a distant desert city, Maximus is then sent to fight in the Colosseum in Rome, where he at last has the opportunity to avenge both his emperor, Aurelius, and his family, slain by Commodus's troops.  Gladiator is one of those movies that you can watch over nad over again.  bleive me since buying the film on DVD i have watched at least ten times.  every time i watch it i find something new to think about.

There are plenty of fight scenes, some great mano a mano action and some beautiful shots of Rome that make you wonder if you are in the right movie as the grey scale hits big.The problem with this movie is that the greatly hyped special effects are used way too often. You almost expect Jar Jar to show up. And it seems particularly bloodless when a gladiator is cut in half, more than it would be if they used camera angles and visual trickery. Like other computer generated movies, this one leaves you with a headache at the end.

Sexton ""tjs"""	"Gladiator was a 5+ star movie when it debuted in the theater in 2000, and whether you watch it in VHS, DVD or any format it remains a 5+ star movie. Now released in Blu Ray / Steelbook and surprise, surprise ;-)it is still a 5+ star movie.  What did you expect?  It's Gladiator... and the format it is released will never change the fact it is a 5+ star movie and one of the best movies all time, in this reviewer's humble opinion. I would enjoy Gladiator on a 5"" screen in 4x3 format, heck, I would even watch it on one of those old Viewmaster slide flipper thing-a-ma-jigs from the 70's!!  This movie is a classic, period. There is no other way to put it...So now, with Gladiator packaged in Steelbook and Blu Ray, and with 17 minutes of new footage in addition to the Theatrical version, could we even make a case that it is better than ever?  Maybe now 5++ stars?Forget about the fact it is probably one of the most historically accurate movies Hollywood has ever produced.  Then forget about how Russell Crowe turned in the performance of his career - probably the performance of anyone's career.  And let's not forget that this movie was so good, that even Joaquin Phoenix turned in a good performance!  The movie would stand on it's own without any of that - the plot and story itself was well laid out and well executed - and that alone make it a great movie.The Blu Ray transfer quality of the movie was good.  There were a couple of scenes that did not transfer well, for instance the initial scene on the battlefield - some of the shots came out dark and not as clear as I would have hoped. But other than that, the movie looked great in Blu Ray - and definitely an improvement over my DVD copy overall.Bottom line - we are talking about Gladiator here.  In Blu Ray.  With 17 minutes of bonus.  And in Steelbook to boot.  One of the best movies ever made.  Amazon should only offer a five star choice for rating this movie - the 4, 3, 2, and 1 star choices should be grayed out and not selectable!Thanks for reading."	5.0	One of the all-time greats now even better in Blu Ray Steelbook.	2013-08-31	8	7	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2503MK7FPGE76	Tim Russell	The hype surrounding Gladiator led me to believe that this would be an incredible movie.  What it proved to be was a TYPICAL epic with the basic plot of every other epic ever made.  The acting is done fine but was not superb by any means.  Aren't we getting a little tired of revenge as the main theme for movies?  It's time to expand our minds.  Movies such as Traffic accomplished this goal.  It was an original film.  Gladiator won because it had &quot;cool battle scenes&quot; which were not the greatest ever made.  They were poorly designed and the speciall effects were not as well thought out as the special effects in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Gladiator proved to be typical in many respects.  The plot was obvious to begin with.  It's heartwrenching that his family was murdered but give me a break.  Let's talk about ultimate movie cliche.  My family was killed, I must avenge their death.  Gladiator follows the Last of the Mohicans pretty well, differing only in the time period it takes place.  The Academy needs to become more true to the nature of their awards.  The BEST movie of the year should be chosen, not the most typical.	1.0	Not Oscar Worthy	2001-05-27	22	10	12

The writiers of this film paid little attention to history. Commodus ruled for twelve years and began his reign qite ausipiciously, listening to the advisors of his father. The murder of Marcus Aurelius by his son is pure unfounded speculation by people with little historical conscience. Knowing full well the many historical errors of Gladiator, I must once again reiterate that despite these I loved the movie. It is indeed a very Roman movie. The ancient historians had no qualms about changing things up a bit here and there to make a few heros. The imagery of the field and the wheat is taken straight from the spirit of Rome and the pages of Livy, a Roman historian. The Romans themselves would have agreed that the character of Maximus was excellent. Of course, the special effects and the acting were good as well.	5.0	The Spirit of Rome, the Ghost of Romulus	2000-10-05	5	2	3

The pacing of this movie, with the exception of several fight scenes, is leaden. Regardless of what is happening, everyone moves at the same slow pace. Even when the bad guys are hot on the trail, the good guys just sleepwalk through another scene. This might be because this 2.5 hr movie only has 1.25 hrs of plot. Even with all this extra time, nobody thought to add a little dialogue to clean up all the loose ends. For example, after the early battle, he says he wants to go home to his farm &amp; family. If he had said his farm was in Spain (easily done)then it would make sense that he was called the Spaniard when he was a slave.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2WAJWFB6ZPEGW	Toshifumi Fujiwara	I really can't see why this film became so popular. It's basically the same story as Anthony Mann's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, with the thematics of SPARTACUS added to it. This should have been a good idea for a great entertaining as well as powerfully emotional movie in which the audience engage themselves in spite of the fact that the story is 2000 years ago.SPARTACUS is still a powerful film because it's also a story about humanity and idealism; the equality of all humans, freedom, etc.,. It's also has a lot of strong visuals and fine performances through out the entire film; the subject matter is so engaging the actors should be good.THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is a flawed film perhaps, but still is a great one in the way it investigates the corruption of power, which is also a very contemporary theme. (by the way, SPARTACUS was also partly directed by Mann).Now comes GLADIATOR, which is a recent film, but I find it quite obselete because the thematic matter is reduced to one over-used stereotypical idea; the guy wants to fight against a poweful but corrupted empire because he wants to...see his family who are already dead? This mutilated hero doesn't even have the guts to revenge that precious family of his. Come on! Is that a bad joke or something?How an actor, as good as he may be (and Crowe is a terrific one) can put his emotion in a character like this? Well, obviously he couldn't. All that remmains is the fact is that he is still good looking... The other actors are horrible. For instance, just compare the portrayal of the emperor as Anthony Mann envisioned him and the shallow vilan in this Ridley Scott version.This film made me think again that Hollywood now has a lot to learn from its own history. Scott is basically a good, very skilled and inovative director I can't see why he could be satisfied with such an empty, uninteresting script.Okay, I admit, the first 20 minutes battle sequence is quite interesting visually, and that's my reason for the one additional star. I hoped the filmmakers could keep that tention through out the film. But with such a bad script, I guess it must have been difficult to look continuously for interestitng things to interpret as image.	2.0	THE FALL OF ROMAN EMPIRE added with SPARTACUS, but ...	2000-11-23	12	4	8
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1LUSMM31M5IFC	"T. Parry ""Stonewall63"""	Gladiator is a worthy successor to the great sword and sandal films of the past.  With a classic story, great acting, spectacular cinematography, and an incredible score, Gladiator is a true epic in every sense of the word.  Russel Crowe's and Joaquin Phoenix' performances are exceptional, and you find yourself despising Commodus(Phoenix) and actually cheering for Maximus(Crowe).It is hard to watch the film and not be moved by the story, which at some points can drag, but is more than made up for by stunning batte and single combat scenes.  The larger political story gives flesh to the main arc of the film--vengance.  The film is fairly accurrate in its portrayal of the Roman gladiators, and the characters of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus are based on real emperors.The DVD version which I am specifically writing about is excellent.  The chapter segmentations are done very well and you are able to skip to every major scene without any fast forwarding.  The bonus CD has many nice features, including all the trailers, cut footage, and a history of the gladiator games.All in all, this is the best movie of the year, and if you are going to buy it, I highly suggest the DVD version, and if you don't have a DVD player, buy one to see this film...truly an instant classic.	5.0	The Glory of Rome	2000-11-24	3	3	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2E1EVGIK657KC	Travis McFetridge	To begin, this movie is visually stunning.  Upon seeing it in the theaters, scenes like the overhead shot of Rome and the colisseum simply leave the audience in awe.  The DVD is excellent as well.  Russel Crowe (Maximus) does a great job convincing us he is moral man with values, fighting  against a corrupt government and emporor.  However it was Jaoquin Phoenix (Commodus) who really caught my attention.  His role as a tortured soul, who never felt loved by his father (Marcus Auerlius) even in his youth, echoed throughout the film.  He is extremely convincing in his hatred and jealousy for Maximus.  This film greatly parrelled the earlier epic &quot;Fall of The Roman Empire&quot; starring Sofia Loren (who played Lucilla).  I recommend that film to anyone who loved Gladiator, as it had a direct influence on this film, including characters and plot.	5.0	An Excellent Sword and Sandals Epic for 2000!	2000-12-24	0	0	0

Power-hungry Commodus kills his father and orders the death of Maximus. But the latter flees, only to discover that his wife and child have been murdered by Commodus. Crowe proves he is a world class star with his versatile, passionate and physically virile performance.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1CHHXYG1YFQLW	Trevor Cook	Based loosley around the film 'Fall of the Roman Empire', 'Gladiator' is a brilliant epic from director Ridley Scott, bringing the glory and bloodshed of ancient Rome back beautifully. Whether its the gorgeous visual effects, moving story and music, gritty battle sequences, or superb acting that gets you, one thing is for certain: Gladiator is an epic adventure, worthy of all its hype.Russell Crowe's explodes into the spotlight with his role of Maximus, the greatest soldier and general in the Roman army.  When Marcus Aurelias is murdered by his son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, who plays the role of the 'evil' emperor to its limit), Maximus is sentenced to death.  His family is murdered, and he barely escapes execution with his life.  He is picked up, sick and weak, by slavers, where he travels to Africa and becomes a gladiator.  With the help of his new found friends, Maximus eventually rises to Rome, where in the Coliseum, he prepares to take his revenge on Commodus, and free Rome and his once lost love, Lucilla (Connie Nielson).The story itself is beautifully crafted around actual historical events.  For example, Marcus Aurelias was murdered by his son Commodus.  Commodus did go mad.  Commodus did fight in the gladiatorial battles of the coliseum.  and Commodus was killed in combat by a gladiator.  By using these true events to act as connection points, the story flows together, with love and war and revenge all into one.  The music, by composer Hans Zimmer, is absolutely outstanding, though the Celtic feel of it sometimes seems out of place.  The special effects are impressive; never before have we seen Rome or the Coliseum like this.  And acting is excellent from all.The movie is not perfect.  There are minor plot errors, as well as historical aspects that are fictional (the Roman army did not have archers at that point in time; Roman swords were meant only for stabbing; Romans did not have saddles on their horses).  But these are minor in the grand scene.  And grand it is.  Gladiator is by far one of the best movies to come out in quite a while.  It easily ranks up with BraveHeart, El Cid, and other historical epics, and deserves every award it has gotten and will get.  Don't miss this one.	5.0	Not since Rome have we seen something this grand!	2001-02-21	13	10	3
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A8KQFDL7D81KR	Trevor James	Ridley Scott must have known something that nobody did.  That an Ancient Rome-themed movie could sell big bucks at the box office again.  Do you remember way back when (40 years ago) when gladiator movies were so popular?  Well, never has the time period looked better than it does in Scott's much praised masterpiece.  Russell Crowe gives the best performance of his career to date. (Oscar on the horizon)  But what the gladiator movies lacked so long ago was a believeable plot.  So Ridley Scott fixed that by giving Gladiator one of the best story lines of the year.  The 3 hour epic keeps you content during every minute.	5.0	Best Movie Of The Year!	2001-02-04	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A220FJEQNGMSRN	Trevor Willsmer	The extended cut of Gladiator still has many of the problems of the original but doesn't feel as disjointed or quite so disappointing. It's not just that it has more room to breathe, more that the additional footage, particularly the scenes away from Maximus where the future of Rome takes center-stage, raise the stakes beyond the simplistic revenge tale the theatrical version all too often settled for. The climactic fight with Commodus is still a major disappointment not just because it's so underwhelmingly staged but because, unlike The Fall of the Roman Empire, the film it relentlessly plagiarises, Commodus is never a credible threat: where Mann gave him foolhardy courage, Scott has implied he's a coward throughout until even a wounded hero can't even the odds. It's still no Fall, but it is a more satisfying film than the one released in cinemas. Very impressive extra features too.	4.0	A vast improvement, but it's still no Fall of the Roman Empire	2009-05-09	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2R3Z50XIZZ6EO	"Trina G. Campbell ""srvngdaddy"""	This film achieves Ridley Scott's goal of portraying the Roman time period and the gladiator's plight in stunning fashion.  With the combination of a captivating plot, marvelous acting, and second to none special effects, Gladiator shines as one of the best films recently produced.The placement of actors and their performance in this movie is nearly perfect. Russell Crowe is captivating from the very start, and his character's homely attributes make him nearly impossible to dislike.  The character is simultaneously filled with many emotions such as anger, passion, bravery, and loneliness.  Crowe exhibits the qualities needed to perform in this type of role.  Phoenix, in addition, portrays the desired effect through his character with flying colors. The character, along with Phoenix's one of a kind touch makes Commodus create a sense of disgust in the viewer.The historical aspect of the movie, in my opinion, is very well done. Though it may not be completely accurate, it illustrates the grandeur of the Roman Empire magnificently and creates a good balance between history and Hollywood.  The plot is filled with passion and the classic themes of freedom and the power in people.  The action sequences in the movie are great with nearly uncensored views of the bloody life a Roman gladiator.The film has something for everyone from the action film junkie to someone who enjoys quality artistic expression. Ridley Scott achieves a nearly perfect balance between having to sell in the box office while still attempting to be as historically accurate as possible. I would recommend this film to everyone.BB	5.0	"""Outstanding in Every Respect"""	2006-11-28	5	4	1

Zzzz. What's worse, as history it's retarded.  Nothing happened this way, folks, and there are countless anachronisms.  I don't believe that the movie medium is anyplace to really get your history, but at least it shouldn't try to pretend to be historical when it's not even close to the facts.  This is, pure and simple, an abuse of history for the purpose of glamour. At best, it's simply a costume drama fantasy.  They should have changed it from Rome to Lemuria--then they could have added some dragons and fighting skeletons and emulated ""Jason and the Argonauts,"" which is what this movie is closer to than Tacitus.  Otherwise--a Roman general who's actually a man of the wheat--wow, powerful..zzzz. Take away the fight scenes and this is pretty boring stuff. But yes, the fight scenes were often wonderful.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	"Many years ago, Hollywood mass produced epic movies that were not only monuments of spectacle, but also contained meaningful messages that gave films moral magnitude as well. There are several reasons why Hollywood stopped making epic movies and just a few short years ago the great movie epic was said to be dead.Well, the great movie epic is back. It began with BRAVEHEART in 1995 and reached new and different heights with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN in 1998. The tradition coninues with GLADIATOR.GLADIATOR is the story of Maximus, a fictional Roman general. Maximus is the greatest of all Rome's generals. A dying Caesar, Marcus Aurelius, chooses a reluctant Maximus as his heir. However, the Emperor's son, Commodus, has different ideas. Therefore, instead of the Imperial Palace in Rome, Maximus soon finds himself as a slave sold as a gladiator fighting to stay alive on the fringes of the Empire. Maximus is chosen to fight in Rome and from there he plots how to revenge himself against Commodus and make Rome a republic again.Russell Crowe plays Maximus and one word need only be said: amazing. After stellar performances in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER, GLADIATOR has cemented Crowe's place with the top echelon of Hollywood's elite. Other noteworthy performances include that of the late Oliver Reed, who plays the gladiator owner/trainer, and Djimon Hounson, who plays Maximus' gladiator friend.Director Ridley Scott has revived the ""Roman movie"" with this awesome epic. The melding of great performances, visual scenery, special effects, and sound story is a testimony of Scott's skill as a filmmaker.GLADIATOR also contains a moral message. Maximus is a religious man; yes a pagan, but a religious one nonetheless. He is tossed around the wheel of fortune, yet ends the film as he began: a man of integrity and honor. All must die. Yet, it is how we live our lives that makes a difference. That's a lesson, especially in our current troubled times, that's worth hearing (and seeing) again and again."	5.0	Bring It On	2002-01-27	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2329GPAT2XIIZ	Ultimate Reviewer	To my detrement I did not see this on the big screen where I think it must have looked spectacular! The gladiatorial combats are a treat. I think that this must be one of the best representations of what it must have felt like to be a gladiator at the Colloseum. It had a profound effect on me and I was thinking about it for ages afterwards. In the scene where the gladiators are waiting to enter the ring, you can really feel the fear of these poor souls. It is comparable to the first scene of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; where you really get inside the fear of the soldierd aboard the landing craft. But, even though there is some gore, it is not as &quot;in your face&quot; as in &quot;Ryan&quot;. I do have some complaints about it though. In one scene Maximus is in germany and in the next he is in Spain, having evaded capture and having ridden the same horse all that way! Also in the last fight scene, why should the general (I forget his name) suddenly tell his men to sheath their swords and let Comodus die, after all, he has betrayed Maximus throughout by not supporting him. it doesn't ring at all true. Also, I was sorry to see that Hollywoods original departure from history is stil the norm for gladiator films. The thumbs up/down thing to indicate whether you want a downed gladiator to live or die is actually THE OPPOSITE WAY ROUND! Thumbs down means SHEATH your sword. That is where the 4 stars comes in. It is interesting, though, that they used Derek Jakobi, star of the 70's multi part I Claudius. Maybe it was somewhat of a tribute to him. Also, most of the actors are English, which makes sense because, on the whole, English actors really ARE actors.  Some great filming though, and Ridley Scott's obsession with darkness and varying shades of orange is ever apparant. Worth seeing.	4.0	Take some of the &quot;history&quot; cum granum salis.	2001-04-23	1	0	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A26UW8DNN74AGK	"""unhelpful"""	I thought &quot;Gladiator&quot; was remarkably uncompelling.

The effects themselves look totally unreal and strangely prototypical, as if they hadn't quite figured it all out yet.  And the DVD is reverently packaged like everyone involved was confident they'd made a masterpiece.  They didn't.  And the last shot of Russell Crowe walking toward his wife and son reminded me uncomfortably of that idiotic walk into the clouds at the end of another preposterous Roman epic,'The Robe.'  Kubrick's 'Spartacus' is nearly 40 years old, but it's infinitely more advanced than 'Gladiator.'	2.0	Big Budget Bomb	2000-11-26	10	6	4

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3KLC5M7K1C5FJ	Vato-Curandero	Gladiator is possibly the greatest action-adventure film of the past decade, and this is the movie that made Russel Crowe the superstar he is today (much like Top Gun launched Tom Cruise to superstardom). The action scenes and intense battle footage are some of the most heart-pounding moments you'll ever see on screen. Any guy who sees Gladiator will momentarily wish they could be Maximus.The movie features a great plot, thrilling action-packing fighting, superb acting, great costumes and cinematography, and an excellent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. The snowy woods and forests of Germania and the sun-baked deserts of North Africa really stand out, adding a sense of realism and brutality to the storyline. The film's score is very fitting for soldiers who are heading off to battle. And who can forget that memorable bloodbath in the Colliseum where Maximus and colleagues face off against opposing Gladiators armed with horse-powered chariots and superior weaponry?Critics of Gladiator invariably blast the film as nothing more than excessive machismo and violence. I couldn't disagree more. The plot is quite elaborate, with several sub-plots thrown in along the way (but I won't ruin the film for those who haven't seen it yet). The acting really takes this film to the next level, though. Maximus's stoic demeanor and iron-like will is portrayed perfectly by Crowe, who took home the Oscar for Best Actor in 2001 for his performance in Gladiator. Joaquin Phoenix gives a convincing performance as Commodus, a spoiled royal brat and megalomaniac concerned with his perception among the Roman public. Connie Nielsen is under-used in this film, but nevertheless gives a good performance as ceasar's daughter. The film momentarily hints at a past romantic affair between Lucilla and Maximus, but all we are left with is speculation. Just who is the father of little Lucius?I won't ruin the plot, but the storyline follows General Maximus as he leads Rome to victory over a barbarian uprising in Germania. Following the death of ceasar and some unfortunate luck, Maximus finds himself sold into captivity to a slave master in North Africa who uses his property as gladiators because of the popularity of this spectacle. Maximus hacks and slashes his way to become the top gladiator in the Roman empire and soon finds himself heading back to Rome - ready to avenge an old score. Along the way, Maximus wins the loyalty and respect of his fellow gladiators and the Roman public; in the process he achieves an almost emperor-like status. This sets the stage for the film's climax.This was the first Russell Crowe movie I ever saw, and I've been a Crowe fan ever since. Some actors were just born to star in musclebound, action-packed films - and Crowe is one such actor. With Stallone and Schwarzenegger both heading into their 60s, Crowe may be on the verge of becoming the top action actor in Hollywood. Of course, neither Sly nor Arnold ever had Crowe's acting ability, and Crowe never needed steroids to build his muscular physique.I fully recommend Gladiator to any fan of the action-adventure genre. However, an important word of caution: If you are squemish when it comes to violence, some scenes may be hard to watch. There are several scenes of graphic combat in Gladiator, so be forewarned.The DVD contains several nice extras. There are several deleted scenes, the most disturbing of which pertains to a group of Christian adults and children who are fed to lions inside the Colliseum. Ridley Scott provides commentary on both the film and the deleted scenes, and there is information on the production of the film and interviews with Crowe. There are audio options as well, allowing the viewer to choose between Dolby 5.0 and 2.0 Surround Sound channels. The picture quality is very good and vibrant, and when a subwoofer is added to your system, be prepared for a thrilling cinematic experience.Some reviewers have criticized Gladiator for its historical inaccuracy. It should be pointed out that this film never claims to be a true story. However, the main characters are based off of historical figures from different eras of the Roman empire. Marcus Araelius was a real-life Roman caesar, as was Commodus (although they were NOT father and son). Maximus is a re-creation of the Roman General Narcissus, who actually did kill the real Commodus. Joaquin Phoenix's character, Commodus, hints at an incestuous lust for his sister - which mirrors the psychotic real-life Roman emperor Caligula, who had sexual affairs with each of his three sisters.However, if viewers are really that concerned with real-life accuracy, they should be tuning into the History Channel rather than Gladiator. In the motion picture, it is its non-stop action, quality acting and directing, and entertainment value that push Gladiator over the top. You will not be disappointed.	5.0	"""What we do in life echoes an eternity!"""	2005-06-15	7	4	3

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A31D8QKJXU93BT	"Vince Perrin ""Byline"""	"Director Ridley Scott has made a movie about dying that lives up to its subject: two of his leading actors died, one before finishing his performance and another following the completion of his. For these two old hard-drinking friends, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, ""Gladiator"" was their final film. How fitting that they have left us in a popular movie of astonishing scope and splendor.""Gladiator"" is a savage sword-and-sandal spectacle (it revived the genre), a rumination on the politics of then and now, a chronicle of dysfunctional royalty, and a revenge tragedy that turns into a happy family reunion in Heaven. Cecil B. DeMille would have given his last bullhorn to have made this movie, but he lacked the skill and artistic sensibility which Scott has in abundance.Not that DeMille would have fancied the Freudian dynamic of the script, but neither was he the storyteller that Scott is. In relinquishing power, an aging Roman emperor (Harris) bypasses his son (Joaquin Phoenix) for a popular general (Russell Crowe) to rule the empire as a republic. After an act of patricide, the son later sums up his dilemma: ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an empire.""As the general-cum-gladiator, Crowe commands the screen impressively and got an Oscar for it. Phoenix gives the most complex performance and should have won one (he was nominated); Connie Nielsen, as his wary sister, spends most of the movie dodging his incestuous advances. Derek Jacobi seems to have been born a Roman senator. There isn't a weak performance in the picture and several are outstanding, including those by Harris and Reed.Computer graphics provide some of the most mind-boggling images ever created: amassed warriors on battlefields, bustling streets of the ancient world, sweeping views of cityscapes and landscapes, and a Forum overview that includes the entire Coliseum; when gladiators enter it, the camera completely circles them, giving us an eye-popping view of the huge interior crowded with Romans screaming for blood.Scott has an artist's eye for composition and juxtaposition. He knows when to pull his camera back, when to thrust forward. The production design, art direction, costuming and music for this movie are brilliant, as this extended DVD version attests. The supplements on the three discs are generous and non-repetitive, and the extra 17 minutes of footage deepen and finish the film.""Gladiator"" is an intimate epic, if there can be such a thing, and a large scale piece of big box office entertainment.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A1U45PWLFGT8XA	"Walt Williams ""Walt"""	I'm not disappointed in the movie per say, haven seen it in a different format and copied it from TV. I love the story, although it is really just a revenge story, but the side characters, the culture and the action make it seem richer. But the TV version was much better in many places. They had a nice flow in the battle scene, for example, but this version is longer (which is nice) but doesn't flow nicely. The music and pace of the action was great on TV. Sometimes a director falls in love with his own directing and tries to do too much. Perhaps Ridley Scott's direction caused it to lose its flow. The guy was good at large scale scenes such as this and did a great job on the gladiator fight scenes, the editing especially and the epic sized sets, but his artistic direction was a bit forced. Also, I don't recommend the scenes between brother Emperor Commodus and his sister for the sensitive set or younger people. Another negative is the historic aspect. They use some real names but this is not an historic story at all. But just ignore that if you know better and enjoy the flick. Just get a different version if you can.	3.0	Disappointed in this version	2013-04-22	4	2	2

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"(Updated for Blu-ray remaster 8/19/10):Although the plotting is a bit uneven at times (with some minor plot holes due to the numerous writers who worked on the project), ""Gladiator"" is a brilliant looking spectacle which allows director Ridley Scott to excel. Scott's brilliantly shot and edited film over comes its slight narrative flaws due to terrific, strong performances from a Oscar caliber cast and the epic production.The Blu-ray looks positively stunning and is a huge step up from the original DVD and the previous Blu-ray which looked better than the DVD (particularly for the extended version sequences)but failed to live up to the potential for Blu-ray due to the use of an old HD master prepared for TV broadcast. Colors are richer, image quality is crisp, sharp and absolutely stunning at times nicely capturing the theatrical presentation in high definition.The biggest problem with the previous edition was the overuse of digital noise reduction which worked for the HD broadcast of the film but the higher resolution of Blu-ray betrayed all the extra noise reduction and elimination of textures. Universal (which actually mastered this for Paramount since they own the negative and Paramount only has North American distribution rights) has done a marvelous job. Textures and a high level of detail have been returned to the film taking it back closer to its theatrical presentation.We get the same special features as the previous Blu-ray and DVD editions of the film with the bulk of them on the second disc. Paramount is running an exchange program as previously mentioned for those who have the previous edition (like I did) and if you mail the original transfer disc to them they'll return the new Blu-ray disc. You will probably need to call them to confirm if which version you have however. The phone # is 888-889-9456 and the address is PHE MKT c/o Deluxe Media Mgmt PO Box 801464 Valencia, CA 91380-1464. Include your name and address in the package.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AHSOATU39KF00	Wayne L. Giza	When I first saw Gladiator in the theater I was somewhat disappointed. Watching it on DVD caused my appreciation for it to grow. It can now be listed among my favorites. So much so that I was very much looking forward to the extended version... til I got it. While the additional minutes add to the story, and make it an even better viewing experience, this movie is also a delight to the ear. That's why I am dismayed by the lack of a DTS soundtrack, which is available on the original DVD release.

The extras included are a feast for movie buffs or just someone interested in the making of this film.  There is also added scenes not seen in the theatrical release.  While a lot of effort was put in to making the costumes, weapons, tactics, etc. accurate to history, the history of this emperor was not very accurate.  Marcus Aurelius finally promoted his own son to share the throne as a Co-Caesar before his death from natural causes.  Commodus was strangled by his hired wrestling partner in a plot to get rid of him.  Pertinax took over as emperor as arranged, but his reign was short and led to another  &#34;Year of four Caesars&#34; period.  Commodus had light blond hair we are told by Herodian, and was extremely handsome!  But why quibble with details, the story as told is still quite engaging.  But Hollywood misses the mark by not exploiting the real events which are just as interesting instead of spinning their own version--as seen here!  Still, this one is worth the money.	5.0	Glad I Have It	2013-09-15	0	0	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3CFT5LHFCB46K	"""weirdo_87"""	Gladiator is a movie I saw a couple months ago and it still holds up in my opinion. Russell Crowe does a great performance as Maximus, a roman general who becomes a slave. Joaquin Phoenix is an excellent villian who is so evil you just want to gouge out his eyes with your bare hands. Like alot of epic films that get nominated for Best Picture at the oscars, Gladiator is long and a bit boring. But spectacular battles at the roman colosseum and great acting will keep you riveted right to the end. This film however should not be viewed by the weakened heart, due to graphic violence. But anyone who has a big set, is interested in the roman empire or who just likes great movies should watch this cinematic masterpiece.	5.0	Let's hope it sweeps the oscars!	2001-03-24	1	0	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2DBO5Z8W3ZJPO	Welt	Boring, typical, overrated, uninspired Hollywood tripe.Spectacular action sequences, decent cinematography and brilliant performance (by none other than Phoenix) marred by EXTREME lack of substance, and a truly hokey and predictable script. Scott's frantic direction can't save this utter waste of film. Not for a second. As far as I'm concerned, this movie just caters to the random and puerile 15 year old. Did anyone care about Maximus? I sure didn't. Robbie the Robot has more life and emotion than this guy! Crowe's performance is dull and destitute, and quite frankly, makes the whole project destitute with his dull and empty presence. He's like paper-mache up there. Yeah, I know Maximus' world takes a tragic turn for the worst, but COME ON! He's a paper-cut-out for the entire movie! Very annoying. What's worse is he actually got an Oscar for it. Yikes! Who knew wooden acting was awarded so shamelessly?Yeah, I liked the hyper, ultra-violent action scenes. The movie had the potential to be a great action film. Thus the reason it gets 2 stars. Well, not the only reason... this abysmal failure of a movie has somewhat of another saving grace. Yep, Joaquin Phoenix's abrasive performance as the villain, Commodus. He's too good for this tedious mess. It's just too bad his brilliance can't correct the errors that litter the rest of this tedious insult.In the end, Gladiator is completely void of any intelligence, originality, and soul. People bawled at the end. I didn't. How could I? I didn't feel for Maximus. He was a dry, sour and ridiculous character. He's extremely hollow. So is the script! I can't understand why so many people commend this...So many awards for such a weak little meaningless, forgettable movie.So, in summation, this inferior pile of wretchedness is literally clubbed to death with more cliches than you can shake a stick at. And to tell you the truth, I laughed at the end. It's THAT [weak]. A movie that struggles for 2 hours to build up this intense level of emotion and drama, and failing so miserably. Makes me chuckle.Recycled piece of boring regurgitated Hollywood junk.	2.0	See ya later, Gladiator	2003-04-27	15	5	10

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ARWCFLO1Q0XY9	W. Foley	I really enjoyed this film. The acting was very well performed, and it is a visually stunning film. I think it brings to life the time period better than any other film of its type. It is a great popcorn munching piece of eye-candy. But as an historian I really cringed with one of the premises of the movie. I also know that there are some people whose only information regarding historical events comes from watching Hollywood movies. That is not a good thing. Historical accuracy is not one of Hollywood's best attributes.At the end of the film they would have you believe that the Empire was abolished and the Republic was restored. (Anti-monarchial sentiments?) But in reality that was not the case. The two emperors are historical figures who actually lived in real life. Emperor Marcus Aurelius ruled Rome from 161AD until 180AD, while his son, Commodus, excellently played by Joachin Pheonix, ruled from 180AD until his murder in 192AD. But hopefully most people are aware that there was not a restoration of the Roman Senate after the death of the emperor Commodus. The Empire in the West survived for another 284 years, while the Eastern, or Byzantine, Empire survived until 1453 when emperor Constantine XI was deposed by the Turks.I think films such as this are good for capturing a way of life that can be hard for people to conceptualize, and they can also be an excellent impetus for investigating further into historical information.	4.0	Good Movie, Bad History	2003-02-08	0	0	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3LVJAERSYW90Z	"W. Han ""DOIWO"""	This movie is one of the summer's better movies because it has emotion all around (except the ending) and very good acting.  The movie starts off with a battle and then introduces the characters, which gets you on the edge of your seat in the very beginning.  Russell Crowe acts with power, as he would've made a good attorney, and the other actors didn't do that bad either and sound persuasive.The storyline is pretty straight foward and a little simple, with a few extra twists.  This movie shows the violence of the Roman past time a bit too many, but causes expense.  The emotion is pretty strong, as you follow the characters along and you're always thinking, &quot;Watch your back, he'll chop your dam* head off!&quot;  A very few movies did that to me this summer.  Not only that, the actors fitted their roles perfectly.  Nobody else could play a better gladiator than Crowe, except maybe for Meg Ryan.  Although the movie shows a bit more blood than I intended for, the violence only ads to the horror of the profession of gladiators.  The music is good and the f/x are one of the best there ever was!  Other than a few storyline problems near the end, the ending is adequete, although not the best ending, it almost sheds a tear.	4.0	Good Production, Excellent Quality	2000-10-26	5	1	4

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3BOH0F7V12H7O	William Kendall	An outstanding epic from director Ridley Scott following the fall and rise of a general who ends up a gladiator after the murder of the emperor. Russell Crowe is ideally cast as the lead, seeking revenge not only for the death of the emperor, but the murder of his wife and son. His Maximus is a man of determination, depth, and courage. Joaquin Phoenix is memorable as the vicious, cowardly new emperor, a sadistic sociopath. The rest of the cast are all well suited to their roles, and the world of Rome and beyond is well captured both by location shooting and special effects.

I purchased the DVD for the movie, not knowing what kind of extras were on it, and I was very pleased with the product.  I am a music fan, so I enjoyed the focus on the music on the second disc.  There are a couple of deleted scenes with the late Oliver Reed that are worth watching.  There is so much on the DVD, that I have not yet been able to see all of the extras, which makes me anticipate the next time that I am able to watch it.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"IMPORTANT NOTE: Several days ago I received a replacement disk of ""Gladiator"" with a new transfer in which edge sharpening and grain reduction have been reduced or eliminated. Paramount insists (see their site) that such enhancement is necessary and correct -- it is NOT! -- and this new edition was made solely to satisfy a number of people who complained. That must have been a /huge/ number, because the cost of remastering and repressing a film is not pocket change. (The new version can be identified by a /yellow/ -- rather than white -- proof-of-purchase tab on the back.)This is typical of the home-video industry. When the LaserDisc was state of the art, some companies (such as Paramount) would transfer beaten-up 16mm prints (eg, ""Hud""), completely ignoring the fact that LV was a medium for movie lovers and videophiles. It's typical of American businesses to degrade the quality of a superior product to the point they think is ""appropriate"" for the Great Unwashed.I realize home video is not the same as theatrical presentation (it can actually be a lot better!), and the studio /might/ want to make adjustments for the best image quality. I can understand the desire to reduce grain -- a /bit/ -- and sharpen the image. But when such ""enhancements"" are so heavily applied that they /degrade/ the image /and/ the viewer's pleasure, they've gone to far.There is no reason (other than saving money!) /not/ to produce the best-possible transfer -- if only so you won't have to redo it. Those who don't or can't see a difference won't care. Those who do, will. (I just read that Blu-ray now has a 17% -- 1 in 6 -- market penetration in American homes. Amazing.)Only Disney and Warners (which controls its own and several other studios' catalogs) have, as far as I can tell, made a consistent effort to produce superior transfers. Universal is erratic, with a not-very-good ""Spartacus"" followed by a beautiful ""Back to the Future"" trilogy and a superb ""Psycho"". (You really /have/ to see the latter. If Mrs Bates doesn't knock your eyes out (ar, ar), the image quality will.)Please read the following with the preceding in mind.-----------------------------------------------------I've seen several reviews -- both in magazines and on-line -- excoriating this transfer for its mediocre image quality. I'm not sure what they're talking about.As for sharpness and real detail, this transfer has gobs of it. Richard Harris is a lined and wrinkled geezer, and the close-ups of the women -- well, woman -- plainly reveal that they're (she's) not wearing makeup.My only complaint is that this is the first Blu-ray I've seen with visible edge enhancement. You will occasionally see trailing-edge overshoot. It's not common, but it does occur.Regardless, the BD's image quality quite obliterates the DVD's. Oddly, the CGI looks much more believable in the Blu-ray than it does on the DVD. I've seen this with other films, and have no explanation, other than the extra detail makes the fake stuff more plausible.As for the film... It's ""Ben-Hur"" redux, without the Christianity. The /overall/ arc of the stories are the same -- a man is unjustly accused of crimes, then has to ""prove himself"" to the Roman populace. The principal difference is that ""Ben-Hur"" is a story of revenge in which the principal character eventually discovers how unimportant revenge is, while ""Gladiator"" is explicitly not about revenge, but about a man's desire to return to what /is/ important to him.Russel Crowe might /think/ he's the world's greatest actor, but he ain't. The otherwise-sharp script portrays him primarily as someone who /doesn't/ want to be where he is. It's hard to act /negative/ attitudes, and he does little except yearn and pine and be noble. Perhaps this is all for the good -- the part is better underplayed. Richard Harris is far more effective -- and memorable -- as Marcus Aurelius.Outside of the fact that the story is a broad fictionalization of real people and events, there are surprisingly few (apparent) errors or anachronisms. The principal error is getting the ""thumbs-up/down"" gesture wrong. The thumb represents the sword -- ""thumbs up"" means cut the guy's throat, ""thumbs down"" means bury the sword in the sand. And when Oliver Reed's character complains that his giraffes won't mate -- ""You sold me queer giraffes!"" -- it reflects a modern view of sexuality that would have made no sense to Mediterranean people.""Gladiator"" is, overall, an very entertaining and well-paced film -- but it's hardly an Oscar contender. It won because, as with many Best Picture winners, it lavishly combines Spectacle and Sentiment. Though almost everyone dies, there's still a Happy Ending.The extras are lavish, including a 3.5 hour (!) feature on the film's making. The first 12 minutes or so of it were transferred with the wrong cadence, and every time something moves, you see scaning-line breakup. There are also at least 100 short segments on various aspects of the film and its production. (I believe all of this appeared in the three-DVD set, but I no longer have it for comparison.)"	5.0	updated thoughts on the image quality...	2009-11-14	22	14	8
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	ATGUPL2UM1HA9	William Wheeler	Fourteen years after Gladiator won the Oscar for best film, I decided I'd watch it.  I was most interested in Joaquin Phoenix' performance as Commodus.  The performance lived up to its hype.  Pheonix turned in a performance of a cowardly, contemptuous tyrant, a thoroughly evil man without being melodramatic.I'll blame the writers for making Commodus out to be worse than the historians make him.  That is pretty difficult to do.  In history, Commodus had a reputation for neglecting the day-to-day maintenance of the empire in favor of Roman imperial parties with all the debauchery that entails.  Commodus did have a whimsical side that wasn't explored in the film.  He liked to dress up as Hercules, carrying a club over his shoulder and a lion's hide for a jacket.  One thing Commodus did do to scandalize the Roman nobility that was dipicted in the film was to appear as a gladiator in the Colosseum, but this is not how he met his end.  After twelve years as emperor and about as popular as an outbreak of plague, a palace conspiracy was hatched in which his mistress attempted to poison his food, but he survived by purging the meal.  Later in the day, his wresting partner was sent to strangle him in his bath.  That was more successful.  The Seante damned his memory, making him only the second emperor to be so dishonored, the other being Nero.This is the second movie I've seen which depicts Commodus as the assassin of Marcus Aurelius.  The other is the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, a film made in 1964.  Sophia Loren played Lucilla and was easily the bet thing about the movie.  In both films, Commodus is prompted to murder his father when he decides to name another man as successor.  In truth, Marcus Aurelius died of natural causes and there was never any doubt about who he wanted to succeed him.  Commodus had been co-emperor with his father for the last three years of Marcus Aurelius' life.  Marcus Aurelius wasn't as good an emperor as his reputation would suggest.  Classical scholars have a hard time reconciling the fact that an emperor who wrote a book of philosophical musing that is still in print and widely read today wasn't a perfect ruler.Lucilla became involved in a plot to assassinate Commodus early in his reign.  The deed was to be carried out by a nephew of both Commodus and Lucilla, but he botched the job.  Lucilla was exiled to Capri, where Commodus saw to it that she was quietly executed sometime later.If I have an opportunity to meet Joaquin Phoenix, I would ask him how he prepared for the part, assuming that he is a method actor.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A35IQ898QX8IQG	Winston May	At the age of nine, my father took me out of school to see the movie Gladiator. You may wonder why in the world would my father take me out of a school to see a movie. The reason was that Gladaitor was a much more educational thing to do than half a day of thrid grade. The movie illustrates war, love, and honor better than any of its predicesers including Braveheart. The first scene of the movie is one of the greatest battle scences ever created to this day. The battle tactics and realities of war were more vivid in this piece than many people were willing to imagine. Even the almighty Roman Empire sustained extensive casualties and injury. The movie then goes on to show how Maximus is captured and forced into being a Gladiator for another mans profit. This and war were the two most common ways a man became a Gladiator. Maximus then with the seeking of vengence out matches every Gladiator in the known world and causes the Emporer Commodus to fight him in an attempt to rid him of all that he meant. In actual history Commodus did actually fight as a Gladiator for fun, but his actual unduing was the Praetorian Guard. This movie shows an acurate amount of history on the history of Gladitorial fights and of the Emporer Commodus and Roman warfare. I would rate this movie as one of the greatest in the history of moving pictures and suggest this to anyone who would enjoy a great movie.	5.0	Timeless Masterpiece	2012-02-17	3	2	1

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A2049TBN63BAJA	"W. Thielemans ""script editor extraordinaire"""	Gladiator is far, far less entertaining than the big sword'n'sandal epics from the fifties and sixties. Russel Crowe's Maximus could have been far more imposing as a character than he is now (he spends most of the film as a brooding wimp). Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus is a weak, immature villain who never really poses a major threat to the hero. The story is full of illogical events, the CGI recreation of Rome is dodgy, and the historical context... well, the less said the better. And the fight scenes are shot and edited in such a way that they hurt the spectator's eyes AND it is nigh impossible to make out what is going on (with the exception of the final duel, where the freneticism makes place for more traditional camerawork; unfortunately, it isn't a very suspenseful or exciting one). I'm probably giving this movie one star less than it deserves, but nevertheless I was very, very disappointed. Anthony Mann's Fall Of THe Roman Empire wasn't perfect, but it treated the same historical subject matter in a much better way than this.	1.0	Oh so overrated. ..	2000-10-18	25	6	19

But the making of the film is truly great. The first battle scene itself alone is worth the price of the video. The fighting in the Colosseum is also gracefully presented. I kept rewinding these parts for many times and still enjoy them so far.

From a happy, loving father who only wants to return to his son and wife, to a gladiator bent on getting his just revenge. Seeing a general who has just one a huge battle cry at the burned bodies of his wife and son is particularly jolting. How can any sentimental person not like him after seeing him cry? From the actions scenes with sword and tigers to the visual affects of the coliseum to Russell in a skirt, this movie is pure eye candy. One of my favorite details is the use of rose petals throughout the movie. Far better acting than Tom Hanks in Castaway (he doesn't even talk for an hour of the movie!) and definately deserves Best Actor awards.	5.0	Best Movie of 2000	2001-01-28	1	0	1
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AUNE3P2AWMG6Z	Xnavynuke	Gladiator chronicles the story of Maximus, a Roman general that serves Rome itself, and not merely the person holding the reins of the great empire. The story is an epic tale that reminds me of the great classic, Ben Hur. True, this movie, reminds me of the modern films, the Patriot and Braveheart, this one surpasses both of these in both story telling and action.While the scenes are at times a little bloody, it is done tastefully, and it does not remind me of some of the gore fests that I have seen. I feel that this story although not totally original, is a very compelling and stirs one's emotions. Maximus is a reluctant hero, and merely wants to be left alone, but his wrath is provoked by the son of one whom he trusted, and he is unjustly dishonored. Through valor and his own abilities, he survives as a gladiator until one day his skill and ability puts him in a position to gain both vengeance and an assured future for Rome.Masterfully directed by Ridley Scott and wonderful acting by those in the movie will make this a classic that will endure as has the classic that this reminds me of, Ben Hur. I would heartily recommend this to all except the most squeamish. This would be a great part of any DVD collection.	5.0	Gladiator is what a blockbuster should be!!	2001-01-06	3	3	0

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	For all you really avid movie-watchers out there, think about this question for a minute: Have you ever seen a movie starring Russell Crowe where you said &#34;that was really bad?&#34;.  I didn't think so either.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Gladiator&#34; tells the story of Maximus (Crowe), one-time member of the Roman army turned gladiator slave at the hands of tyrant ruler Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).  While fighting all that the Colosseum can throw at him, Maximus must also inspire a revolution to return Rome to its former glory.Despite starting off quite slow for the first 30-40 minutes, &#34;Gladiator&#34; quickly becomes top-notch drama primarily because of the simmering intensity Crowe brings to his role.  Without his presence in this film, I cannot think of another actor who could have turned in such a nuanced, show-carrying performance.  His gravitas on screen carries itself almost without dialogue whatsoever.This is also the kind of film (much like Crowe's later work &#34;Robin Hood&#34;) that is quite long but only builds on itself.  It takes some time for the real drama to really kick in, but when it does it is all the more pertinent because of the character development we have already seen.Overall, &#34;Gladiator&#34; is a great movie that has a little something for everyone.  If you like historical fiction, battle scenes, drama, or incredible acting, than this film will capture your interest for a full two and half hours.  I can easily see why it cleaned up at the Academy Awards in 2001.	5.0	"""Death Smiles At Us All. All We Can Do Is Smile Back"""	2013-11-16	1	1	0
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A320E866XEA97C	zac	Gladiator presents to movie goers a refreshing and original piece of story telling. The plot is easy to follow but contains enough twists and creativity to keep viewers interested. Personally, I myself would rank this movie high on my list of the greatest films of all time...Entertaing and truly superb, Gladiator is a true winner.The performances were extraordinary. Russell Crowe is amazing as Maximus, but the real standout, omitted in earlier reviews, is by Joaquin Phoneix, as the looked down upon Caesar of Rome, Commodus. My two other favorite were played out by Connie Neilsen and Richard Harris. Overall, the charcters brought their emotions upon the auidience very well and let me relate to them.Technically, the film acheives greatness all across the board.From the spectacular visuals, state of the art direction (Ridley Scott), and fitting costumes, to the screenplay and powerfull score (Hans Zimmer).The many battle scenes are breathtaking and extremly fun to watch. Some memorable scenes included the opening battle with the barbarians of Germania, The first colleseum battle in Rome, the tiger fight, Maximus' getaway, and the climatical concluding battle between Maximus and Commodus.Overall the film is unflawed. Bound to give you chills, Gladiator is the story of betrayal, lost love, revenge, and loyalty. As you know gladiator won multiple oscars at the 2000 Academy awards inclusing best picture and actor, Joaquin recieved only a nod.

B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A3OI841P5R6FCH	Zagnorch	Yikes! With over 1200 customer reviews about `Gladiator' (as of this writing) posted, I think I'll hold off on reviewing the movie proper. I seriously doubt that anything I'll say about it will sound any different from what many of the others have written, so I'll let my fellow Amazonians try to wow you with their insights on how good, bad, or indifferent this flick is. Instead, I'm going to review something that most folks have neglected to mention in their prose critiques: the DVD extra features! And off we go...Being the high-tech, big-budget box-office champion that it is, one would naturally assume that `Gladiator' would have a pretty wide array of bonus materials. And sure enough, that is indeed the case. In fact, there're so many extras, the studio devoted an entire second platter to `em. But first, let's start off with the feature-length commentary. Director Ridley Scott and a few of his filmmaking cohorts go into the details of how each particular scene was devised and filmed, how they tried to make the movie historically accurate in some ways, and other things regarding the making of this film. Throw in a few amusing anecdotes here and there, and you have pretty much your basic commentary track that doesn't particularly stand out from others I've listened to before.Okay, now we can get on to the bonus disc. There's the obligatory teasers/trailers/TV spots section, as well as a half-hour behind-the-scenes doc where you see the director and principal actors get a bit too involved and in describing their roles, and taking things a bit too seriously. I mean, I like the movie and all, but sheesh-lighten up a little, guys! Also thrown in is an hour-long documentary that goes over the history of the original Roman gladitorial contests, which I found both entertaining and informative. True, it was likely included as an attempt to appease the more nitpicky moviegoers who demand historical accuracy, but I liked watching it none the less.Then there's the gallery of deleted scenes, all of which include commentary from the director. After seeing these bits of trimmed footage, I thought it was a shame that Mr. Scott didn't see fit to restore them to the movie... oh well. There's also the interview with composer Hans Zimmer regarding the scoring of the film which I found less than exciting. I like the movie's soundtrack tunes and all, but it doesn't exactly make for a compelling interview.Also thrown in to fill out the package are several storyboards and behind-the-scenes photos. You know, a little something for the cinema uber-mavens to drool over. Personally, I would've preferred a blooper reel, but that's me...`Late	4.0	There's more to this DVD than the movie, you know...	2002-02-10	2	0	2
B00003CXE6	Gladiator [VHS]	A318RKL1I9ABCM	"""zaloop"""	Gladiatorial combat is immortalized in this film, the only way it can be: through stunning action sequences and beautiful imagery. It also immortalizes, above all, director Ridley Scott.Roger Ebert complains of people with short memory spans praising this film while forgetting that films like Spartacus have supposedly done this before. Well, I have a good memory, and I remember Spartacus. In fact, I kept on remembering that film while watching Gladiator, only in the context of, &quot;This is so much better than Spartacus. It goes beyond.&quot; The action is better, the visuals are better, the story is better, and the acting is better. Sorry, Kirk.Since this is an action film, the story isn't the most important element, but for an action film it is actually quite good. For one thing, I liked the disturbing under-the-surface incest element going on between Commodus and Connie Nielson. Furthermore, it was interesting to see how Crowe gained support among the gladiators until it became as if he were a general leading his army again. The plot itself needed to be there in order to fully create a sense of grandeur. With its insurrection story, the rise of the hero and his trek to the capitol of Rome, and the look at the people in power, the plot creates a sense of time-and-place necessary for an epic that couldn't exist with the visuals and action alone.The acting is among the best one can ever seen for an action film, and there is plenty of fine dramatic work pulled off by the two main actors. Russell Crowe is now one of the best &quot;new&quot; (four or five films so far) actors in film. We believe, in his glances and the ways he delivers his many great lines, that he is Maximus. He is poignant, hate-filled, and sorrowful all at once. The praise he is getting is deserved. But why isn't Phoenix being lauded just as much? He carries the film in the second-largest role just as well as Crowe. His Emperor Commodus isn't a good villain and has no real character, but Phoenix adds so many layers to him and turns him into a great antagonist that that alone makes his performance excellent. He commands attention just as Crowe does. All by himself (no help from any great dialogue or development), he creates a villain that is prissy, whining, ambitious, pathetic, and malevolent, and worthy of our hate as well as our pity. It's a wonderful transformation. To sum it up, the characters themselves aren't really developed at all- but the acting is so good that it seems they are.Now, onto the action, which, as I had hoped, is plentiful and intense. It has diversity and grandeur. All the fights were fast, hard-hitting, uncensored, and very bloody, which is what they should've been like. And every single fight sequence is unique from the others. There's the match where two men fought chained to each other, the opening war battle, Maximus vs. numerous other fighters, and the final sword duel, to name a few. This is so much more than just two half-naked men fighting with swords, which is what it could've been. The film also captures the feel and the motion of combat. Ridley Scott speeds up the film slightly during fight scenes to show the chaos and rapid reflexes necessary to survive. During the fight scenes, the camerawork is nonstop and covers the combat as one big blur to the fighters. (But we can still follow the fights themselves.)This film also stands out in my mind as one of the most visual, image-driven action films I've ever seen. Thanks to Ridley Scott, practically every scene is jammed with wonderful detail, art direction, even distinct lighting (the Collosseum orange, other parts of Rome dark blue). Just look at the wide multitude (seemingly infinite number) of battle masks, weapons, and locales. Cinematography is skillful and impressive. There are tons of memorable shots, like Maximus entering the ring with rose petals coming down on him like rain from above, Commodus' pure white battle costume (when he's being risen up on the platform he looks like a demented angel ascending to heaven), and the images used to represent Crowe's home- the gentle hand carressing the wheat reeds, the door to his house, etc. They had a surreal quality and each were bathed in their own distinct color. Excellent work, Ridley.A very impressive film. So why can't all summer movies be this good? We'd be spoiled.	5.0	We salute you, Ridley.	2000-10-30	410	340	70
