B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3Q5S9VH832QW5	AA	"Lord of the Rings is not just about men, elfs and dwarves fighting orc armies while Evil Lord seeks to regain his lost ring.It is about the resilience of human spirit. It is about us and our desire to survive against all odds. It is about our iron will and our capability to unite and fight against common enemy who threatens our kind.This is why Lord of the Rings has struck a chord with all those who dare to plunge into its dark depths and evil plots.If Tolkein's book was grand with graphic details about massive orc armies threatning the middle earth, Peter Jackson's movie is well, ""grander"".Director Peter Jackson brings to life what all of us could only imagine. True, some things are not exactly as they are in the book, but the changes are apt and in many cases necessary. For example, do you really want to hear all the songs Merry and Pippin sing in the books? I was relieved I didn't have to.The movie begins where the last one left off, Gollums treachery and Froddo's encounter with Shelob. The book had this covered in Two Towers itself but the movie carries it beautifully in the Return of the King.The only other deviation worth mentioning is towards the end when triumphant Froddo returns to the Shire and finds Saruman and Wormtongue bullying the Hobbits. This part was not shown at all.Apart from that each and every detail of the book, from elf world to city of minas tirith has been beautifully recreated. The green ghost army of mountain men and humungous Oliphaunts add to the magnificience of the story line. If you take a deep breath your heart will start pounding as men struggle against all odds to beat Sauron's orcs.Aragorn and Arwen's fairy tale love, Gimli and Legolas' friendly, almost playfull rivalry and Froddo and Samwise Gamgee's deep bond of friendship bursts forth in a thousand colors and leaves you wondering how the director managed to do it all in such vivid details while maintaining the flow of the book and coherency of the plot.My favourity scenes include battle for Minas Tirith and &Eacute;owyn's valor as she slices dragon's neck and then kills Nazgul. My wife's include love scenes between Arwen and Aragorn adorned with beautiful, almost delicate elf words. I am sure you will find your favourites as you watch the movies again and again."	5.0	Why You should Buy Lord of The Rings	2004-08-03	2	0	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1GMF57M876V99	"Aaron Long ""Young Academic"""	"Do I really need to offer a synopsis of a film that we've all seen? In fact, do you need to read yet another review that holds Jackson's directing and his cast's acting in high regard? No. That's not what I've done here, either.Instead, I'd like to pay tribute to Tolkien, whose imagination sowed the seed that has grown into the Great Tree of this trilogy and its cultural shade.(Yes, third time I've used that intro, if you've read my other two extended scenes reviews... so what?)  Artistic license sadly overstepped its bounds in this one.  The elimination of ""The Scourging of the Shire"" drops one of Tolkien's primary themes, and mutes the story's prophetic voice in the age of modernity.  Tolkien was trying to comment on the loss of innocence--his own, and his generation's--and demonstrate that despite that sad loss, hope need not be among the casualties.  We got the hope theme from the film, but the loss of innocence was insufficiently portrayed.  The War of the Ring did not even leave the Shire untouched (read the book--you should have before seeing the film anyway).  And just when a return home looks welcoming, the hobbits find one last chore between them and peace.Nevertheless, the sheer number of digital effects/sequences, more Smeagol, the glory of Gondor, the horrors of war, the brilliance of the Ride of the Rohirrim (my aging professor quoted a couple of stanzas from Tennyson's ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" from memory, he was so inspired), and the heart-rending theme of loyalty relit make this an inspiring cinematic experience.  Jackson and crew have done the unachievable, and we sit spellbound.How unachievable is it?  Check out the extra two discs to find out.  Make a day of it.  It's worth it.Wish you'd left us the retaking of the Shire, Pete.  But I understand your reasons for not doing it.ALong"	4.0	The Good Finale	2006-06-01	5	4	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A19G3IUSQC7OGC	A-banta	Some people give a movie 5 stars, some give it 1 star. Often it doesn't deserve the 5 star, or it is better than a 1 star. But not this movie. It deserves the 5 stars i am giving it. The return of the king is a spectacular blend of drama and action. The action doesn't overshadow the plot, nore is it just a slow paced drama. ROTK is a perfect blend of the two, like the nice blend of fudge and vannilla in vannilla fudge swirl ice cream.Let me tell you the joys and reasons why no movie equals ROTK.Acting-  Everey role is perfectly assigned. Just picture the disaster that would have occured if the wrong actor was cast. Normally i dont like Orlando Bloom (Legolas) (no matter how hot you say he is), he seems kindof vacant. But he fits legolas perfectly: calm, handsome, quiet, etc.  Then there is Elija Wood (Frodo) who is a magnifecent actor. When i watched the movie, i literally felt the physical and emotional pains he was suffering. Sean Austin (Sam) was perfect. You senced how much Sam cared for Frodo, and how he stopped eating, so Frodo would have enough to eat. I found Sam among the most emotional chacters in the movie. Ian McKelin was also wonderful, he had a nice sagely feel to him, he had a serious yet cheerful tone to him and i he is a great actor. Viggo Mortenson (Aragorn) was amazing, he had a wonderful knack for conveying emotions wonderfully through his face. Andy Cerkis (Gollum) was amazing. He didn't do just the voice as many say, actually he drove the charactars movements in a motion capture suit and made the facial expression. He put every ounce of his strength into making a good character; bashing himself on the rock, dragging himself on the ground and tearing his throat apart with that incredible voice acting.Visual Effects- They were stunning, people may say, but i say they were not stunning. That is what made them great. They were so real that you did not think they were special effects, and that is what you want to go ofr, not some stupid lightshow (Star Wars II). They spent 2 years designing Gollum. Gollum was not a ball on a stick, he was not immaterial. The actor Andy Cerkis did his voice, movements, and facial expressions. Gollum was a real carachter. Andy Cerkis was there the whole time, performing a wonderful dramatic display. Andy Cerkis was there, making film history. And the rohan army was massive, it required digital horses and soldiers. You could definitely not tell wich soldier was real or not before they were tossed into the sky by the nazgul. Thhe nazgul's dragons were spectacular with massive flapping wings, but regardless of the fantasticness of this, it does not seem fake or out of place at all. The visual effects are not stunning. The visual effects are great.-Music- Just listen and you will be blown away. The great vhoruses at mount doom and minis tirith, the carefree shire theme, and the Rohirrim theme, which i find strangely nostalgic. The theme to the white tree of Gondor has a wonderful sence of growing danger. The music is beyond beutiful.-Direction- It is a miracle. Peter Jackson filmed 13+ hours of film consecutivly. The entire crew put heart, soulf, and life into this production. If Peter Jackson does not win best director, i will really go insane.This is a legendary masterpiece. The Return of the King will be considered one of the greatest movies of all time. The emotion, the action, the sorrow, the whole feel of it is incredible.	5.0	An epic masterpiece.	2004-02-26	3	3	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3TVRV55XEF13D	"Abi Lu ""Happy Hobbit"""	I don't know why some people complained about ROTK being so diffrent from the book. There where a few things that where left out(ei Faramir and Eowyn's relationship, Eomer becomming king of Rohan ect..), but the movie is already 3hrs long! Most of that will probably be covered in the extended version DVD. There where a couple things that where actualy changed, but it was not so much that it stole from the integrity of the story.My favorite element(in the film and the books) is probably the beautiful friendship between Frodo and Sam. Many of the scenes with them will bring you to tears. So wear waterproof mascara!I love the books and for the most part the movies have done them total justice.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A21IMO4TXXSBZ0	Absinthe	I'll begin with my thoughts on the movie: it was too long with way too many endings.  I thought the scene between Arwen and Aragorn slobbering all over each other at his coronation was cringe-worthy (I mean honestly... they did everything but dry hump).  the third movie also ignored parts of the book in favor of adding scenes that appeared to be ad hoc with no other purpose than to extend the movie by a good 45 minutes.Now on to the packaging:  I've watched the DVD's a few times, and some of the little round tab buttons in the package have snapped off, entombing the DVD in the case.  While trying to pry out the DVD for the second half of the movie, it snapped in half!  The packaging otherwise looks slick, but they could have sprung for the extra 5 cents a package to get something more durable and unbreakable than the highly-fracturable plastic they used.	2.0	Movie was too long.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A32HM4MO1O3BHM	A Customer	Return of the King is the best movie that I've ever seen in my whole entire life. Its gorgeous! Breathtaking & simply wonderful. Its the best movie of 2003. If this movie doesn't win a few Oscars then I'll scream that the Academy Awards are rigged.Seriously this movie simply deserves it. Could anything be more wonderful? I loved this movie. Just loved it! Once again we join the characters in the battle between good and evil. The film opens up by telling us of Gollum's history and how he became wrapped in evil. Its short but somewhat graphic. The journey continues with Frodo & Sam to destroy the ring at Mordor. Meanwhile Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, Eowyn, and the rest of the hobbits prepare themselves for war.I loved the battle scenes. They were awesome! I also like how Eowyn got some action at the battle scenes! Yeah! I like it when females are strong and can hold their own! I think Peter Jackson did a nice job by wrapping up the movie & he ended it well. Yes its sentimental, so what? I love sentimentality and its handled pretty well.This movie has everything. Its good vs. evil, war, love, friendship and loyalty. Breathtaking scenery, amazing special effects, and damn good acting. Sean Astin and Elijah Wood are wonderful. I hope this film gets the recognition it deserves from the Academy Awards.They had to change some things from the book to the movie but I think they did a wonderful job. Peter Jackson was the right director for this project. The gamble that the studio took on, paid off extremely well.Go see it! You won't regret it.	5.0	The best movie I've ever seen!	2003-12-20	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A33L7G4E8CID3	"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19"""	Let me get a few things out of the way here: I have never read any of the books. I was lukewarm on the first movie, liked the second one, but I had seen better movies last year. This movie, though, was quite a ride. This movie certainly deserved its honors for Best Picture, such a moving and entertaining film it is. The Return of the King provides a coda to the Lord of the Rings series and ties up all the threads, there is one heck of an emotional payoff, although the end is tinged with melancholy. In terms of narrative power, it is unmatched among the series, and it keeps the action simultaneously epic and personal.The plot, as you know, has the characters mainly split apart: Gandalf (Ian McKellan) is off to lead the troops against the armies of darkness, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) tries to unite the various denizens of Middle Earth to band together to fend off the onslaught with his band of warriors (Orlando Bloom, Jonathan Rhys-Davies, both excellent, as before), and Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, respectively) returning the ring to the hellfire to bring the war to an end once and for all. The same themes of duty, friendship, and courage continue to abound here, and the characters really come to life here, more so than in previous installments, in my opinion. The CG work is absolutely breathtaking, especially the war elephant scene, which is so incredibly real. It is, like both its predecessors, remarkably well made in terms of production values, but this one really plays with the emotions of the viewer, at least more so than its predecessors.In short, even if you weren't the biggest fan of the last two, this one might just surprise you. My one complaint: I saw it on opening night and didn't see one person dressed as Gandalf! What's the matter with you, LOTR orthodoxy? :) I kid, of course: the movie does drag a little at the end, but that is understandable, there's a lot to tie up. In short, this is one you've got to see.	5.0	Film Powerhouse	2004-04-16	4	2	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A16E68RMTCHUYM	Adam	If I could give this movie 6 stars, I would do it in a heartbeat. This movie is one of the top 5 movies I have ever seen in my life. If you love fantasy movies, this would be most likely your number 1 choice. I haven't read the book(s) to it (them) yet, but I would have to say that J.R.R. Tolkien is an outstanding and astonishing imaginative genius. I definitely think that he is a hell of a lot better storyteller than L. Frank Baum, no offense. I am really glad that all 3 of the movies had received the Academy Awards that they got, especially The Return of the King. I think that EVERYTHING that is done in ALL of The Lord of the Rings movies, especially this movie, are beautifully crafted and achieved in a way that you will cherish this trilogy for the rest of your life.	5.0	One of the absolute best films I have ever seen	2004-03-23	5	4	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3T769B249IZIT	Adam Pierson	This movie is a prime example of why not every book should be made into a movie, least of all an amazing classic like The Lord of the Rings.  Not only was much of the original material overlooked, but new material was added that did nothing to enhance the story. Did Peter Jackson think that no one would come see the movie if there was no romance? Romance was added and at the most inappropriate moments. Characters died that never did, true heroism was turned into cloying, wistful looks and less than heroic speech. Worst of all was the return of Sam and Frodo to the untouched Shire.  Tolkien was making a huge point by having them return to a Shire that was being ravaged and ripped apart. It would seem that no one connected with these movies bothered to read or understand Tolkien's work.Save your money and buy a good copy of these books and read them many times in the years ahead.	1.0	A travesty which dishonors JRR Tolkien	2004-08-31	49	14	35

Am one of those who was sucked into buy the regular DVDs and the fancy extended sets - and don't regret it!  I absolutely love these movies and could never grow tired of them.  But I have been on pins and needles wanting to see the final installment - hopeful it would live up to the first two - fearful it would not.  And I am one HAPPY CAMPER to report that it delivers!!  I won't spoil the plot for you deserve to experience the wonderful brilliance for yourself, just tell you how amazing this film is!!There will be some grumblers about liberties taken with Tolkien's story, and I was sorry to see Chris Lee short-shifted (though I understand from the releases we get more closure to the treason of Isengard in the extended version - sigh, guess I will be queueing up for both versions of the DVD again!).But the movie makes all movies pale beside it.  Epics like Braveheart and Spartacus seem Mickey Mouse when compared to the battle of Pelennor Fields.  The acting is first rate, with the many beloved characters going to the wall for save middle earth.  If this does not get best movie - the academy has take leave of the senses!!  This will reign for some time as THE film, it's just so amazing.  Just to give you an idea - the battle of Pelennor Fields makes the battle for Helm's Deep seem pale!The emotions, the willingness to give all for the good of others has never been so evocatively filmed.The story  starts with the small history of Gollum's killing his brother to gain possession of the ring, then it is 3 1/2 hours of wonder magic and everything we have come to expect.All I can say, is hurry up and get it on DVD so we can enjoy this over and over again.A beautiful end to the trilogy.  As a Tolkien fan, and a lover of his many others tales of Middle East, I can but hope, one day Jackson will come back and give us more tales of this wonderful world.	5.0	Holy Cow!  He did it!!

Definitely falls under the 'masterpiece' category. Peter Jackson, the cast and crew have truly outdone themselves.While I would've preferred more with Legolas and Gimli (including mention of their sailing together for Valinor) and Faramir and Eowyn, it leaves me something to look forward to in the DVD.Arwen wasn't nearly as annoying of a distraction from the main storyline as she was in TTT (even though the whole 'she's dying' bit was cheesy and unnecessary, it can easily be overlooked).I've never been much of a fan of the Hobbit storylines, but even these kept my interest this time around as they were compelling, heartwarming and heartbreaking all at once. The love and loyalty between these characters was never more apparent than in this film.This is the first movie that has ever captured my heart enough that I've sat through it 8 times in a movie theatre and would gladly go 8 more times if they brought it back to my town.	5.0	Saving the Best for Last	2004-02-28	5	5	0

That being said, however, I found The Return of the King to be my least favorite of the three films.Although a true blue fan of the Tolkein books, I can understand the need to omit parts of the book when making a film.  In the first two films Jackson made up for that with wonderful character development.  But the heavy reliance on special effects and the awkward tying up of cheesy previously added subplots in ROK was very disappointing to me.	4.0	Books to film	2004-11-22	21	4	17

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A379SAP75SPDHD	Alec Solomita	Return Of The King is more than the best movie of the year. It is also the best trilogy of all time! There have been some great trilogies in cinema history, but none of them were able to not only sustain the greatness of the original, but improve on it to create the greatest epic film trilogy of all time. If the first LOTR introduced and developed the characters and had amazing small moments, the second one continuing us on our journey without having a beginning or end and yet still able to keep our interest and amaze us with action, the third one shows our characters being developed into who they become and still manages to upstage the action of the second one. A third intsallment has never wrapped up so nicely and Peter Jackson should get an Oscar for his amazing work. Sean Astin and Ian Mckellan both put in great performances in a wonderfully acted and directed film. The only bad thing about this movie is that it brings a great series to an end and the only reliable franchise we have in the wake of The Matrix and other silly sequels. This film and series will be remembered forever as a classic.	5.0	The Ring That Ruled Them All!	2004-01-01	9	8	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A182E0HWSK2EQH	Alejandro Carrasco	The first thing that comes to mind is WOW!!!!  I was enthralled for the whole four+ hours.I will concentrate this review on the differences between this edition and the theatre version.  The new and extended scenes are definately aimed for those of us who wanted a movie version that is truer to the books.  The only complaint I have is the way in which the fate of Sauruman was portrayed.  It is not the same as in the books and I don't see why it couldn't have been done that way.  On to the good... I love the extra scene with Aragorn barterring with the Mouth of Sauron at the gates of Mordor.  That scene is worth the price of the Extended Edition.  The scene with the Witch King and Gandalf is also fantastic.  The added scenes of the development of the romance between Faramir and Eowyn allows for some closure to both charater's lives after the final battle.  I had doubts when I heard of the inclusion of scenes having Frodo and Sam dressed like and marching with orcs, but is worked out great.The added and extended scenes are put in seamlessly.  You never feel like you are watching anything just for the sake adding in extra scenes.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the threatrical version and to anyone wishing for more elements from the books to be included in the movie.	5.0	Saved the Best for Last	2005-01-11	1	1	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A20LY8E9NGYA4M	Alejandro Cortes	"In the final months of the year 2002, everybody was waiting for the release of the final two chapters of the ""Matrix"" trilogy, a lot of fans thought that ""Matrix"" could be the most spectacular trilogy in movie history. Meanwhile, quietly, the first two installments of ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy amazed the audiences all around the world due to the artistic and technical quality of the movies.Finally came the year 2003, and while ""Matrix: Reloaded"" and ""Matrix: Revolutions"" failed to achieved the quality of the original ""Matrix"", ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King"" masterfully concluded the most impressive and ambitious project in movie history.Unlike ""Star Wars: Episodes I & II"" and the Matrix movies in 2003, ""The Return Of The King"" actually topped the achievements of the first two installments, due to it's incredible quality in every aspect: visual effects, special effects, music, make-up, wardrobe, photography, direction and spectacular scenes. After three years of watching a chapter of the trilogy in december, most of the audience was very satisfied with the final result.""The Return Of The King"" running time is almost an hour longer than the two previous movies, so the movie requires more patience than before, but the reward for the time invested also is bigger than before. The battle scenes will be known as the most spectacular scenes committed to celluloid so far, surpassing the horse race in ""Ben-Hur"", the sinking of the Titanic, the explosion of the Death Star in ""Star Wars"", and the highway chase in ""Matrix: Reloaded"".The three chapters of ""The Lord Of The Rings"" should be considered as a single movie (very long, but still I think it's one movie divided in three installments). Many years will pass before we can see another movie (or trilogy) that can surpass or even reach the artistic level of the ""Lord Of The Rings""."	5.0	THE MOST AMBITIOUS AND IMPRESSIVE PROJECT IN FILM HISTORY.	2004-02-07	0	0	0

This film has terrible special effects that look as fake as they are, the acting leaves a great deal to be desired and the characters are miscast and cartoonized.In the extended edition many hoped it would be 'fixed' but even duct tape couldn't fix this disaster, if you buy this it would be a better investment to flush your money down the nearest drain.

The glimpses of Gollum were too short to judge the success or failure of casting a major character to a cartoon. I am satisfied that special effects can be made beautiful enough to be as convincing as makeup. Gollum's appearance in ""The Two Towers"" was ideosyncratic but not a failure. The character was intelligible, given Tolkien's significant contribution, and the technical performance was ""unreal yet acceptable"".Taken all together this ""Ring"" has been a stupendous achievement with only ""The Return of the King"" to complete the whole. But once again everything hangs in the balance. The key secen to the entire epic is the destruction of the ring. Exactly how that is accomplished will determine the authentic mythological vision of director Peter Jackson. There are only three possible choices; 1)Gollum, the cartoon character accidentally falls. 2)Gollum is pushed. 3)Peter Jackson follows the text and we do not see the cause of Gollum's fall. Upon this hangs the entire enterprise of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"". I tremble - but I will see the movie."	5.0	I'll See it All Again	2003-03-12	27	2	25

But THIS dvd release? The sound and picture quality are about as good as can get, but the extra features are pretty useless. Infact the first two documentaries &quot;The Quest Fulfilled: A Director's Vision&quot; and &quot;A Filmmaker's Journey: Making The Return of The King&quot; use so many of the same images and snipets of interviews that they are almost identicle. They even have the same basic structure.It all depends on how much your into the trilogy, if you enjoyed the movie and want to own it, theres nothing wrong with this release, if your LOVED the trilogy then rent this one, watch the feature and the extras and wait for the extended edition, that will be the version worth owning.	3.0	Great Movie-Pointless DVD release (for most fans)	2004-05-25	9	4	5

For me the viewing experience was always improved in the extended versions so out of curiosity I watched the extended version of Return.Return of the King in its extended version is an entirely different film  full of subtlety and explanations that were highlighted or neglected in the shorter release. It is not just an additional 20 minutes the editting and story telling is shifted and as a result the final telling of the story is more interesting.

Not since the reign of the Star Wars original Trilogy has there been such a passionate embrace of a trilogy of movies such as what we have seen over the last 3 years when it comes to Lord Of The Rings. In some ways this passion has really just begun. However the story of our heroes Frodo, Sam, Arragon and the others does indeed come to a close with ""Return Of The King"". The legacy of these movies will however forever have an impact on our culture as one of the greatest movie achievements of our time. It is for the 21st Century what Star Wars was for the 20th Century.You know the story. There is ring of power created by the evil Sauron to control Middle Earth. Sauron defeated as we saw in the first movie ""Fellowship of The Ring"". The ring is found again and there is a quest to destroy this ring or the world of Middle Earth will seek to exist. Hence our heroes of hope and picking up where we left off with them Frodo, Sam and thier guide Gollum (Smeagol) continue on their dangerous journey to the cracks of Mt Doom to destroy the ring. Will they make it? Will Arragon accept his path and become the King that he was destined to be and lead his people against the forces of Sauron that threaten all of Middle Earth? Well you have to see ""Return of The King"" yourself to find that one out. This is not so much a review as much as it is praise to Peter Jackson for bringing this marvel of an epic story by J.R.R. Tolkien of good vs. evil to the screen. In these times we live in this is a refreshing reminder that no matter how bad things can get one must always have hope that in the hearts of men there lays truth and within that truth lays good. The epic saga of The Lord of The Rings really does capture this theme very well and in the final chapter there is no question that your emotions are going to be aroused unlike they have with any other movie. Expect the unexpected. Remember it is ok to cry, to laugh to cheer. These are all qualities that each of us shares. This is what this was meant for. It will have you talking. It will inspire you. It will take you to a place unlike any other, and most important it has brought people together to appreciate the concept and message behind the story. Praise to Peter Jackson the wonderful cast and crew for bringing this treasure to life for all of us to marvel in and to take something with us that very few movies tend to provide in today's lackluster Hollywood vibe"	5.0	Hail to the King Baby.	2003-12-19	3	2	1

It was a supurb work of cinema, the artistry and special effects were breathtaking, and there was very very little to complain about acting-wise.But as an adaptation?  There are some massively questionable moments, such as linking Arwen's fate *directly* to the ring (as opposed to having her fate be the same as everyone else's, should Sauron get the Ring back).  Such as Elrond bringing Aragorn the sword (in the books, Aragorn had it the entire time, I'm pretty sure).  Such as Merry (and I think Eowyn) at the Black Gate with Aragorn to challenge Sauron in that last battle scene when the Ring was being cast into Mt. Doom.I can't say the *movie* is crap because they did these things, but I can say that the adaptation leaves me with many questions.

Although it is about a half an hour too long, each ending (and there are about ten of them)  was appropriate and needed to be veiwed in order to bring the trilogy to an end.Since bringing these well loved books by JRR Tolkien to the screen was such a difficult process, it is understandable why it has gotten mixed reviews.  Jackson had to meet the expectations of Tolkien fans all over the world while still making a film viewable for those of us who aren't obssessed with Lord Of The RIngs.  The acting, with the excepetion of Ian Mckellan's Gandalf, was probably the worst part of the movie, but the special effects gives you back anything you feel you were deprived of.Probably the best fantasy film ever made, this is definately the best of all three LOTR movies and deserves to be seen, if for no other reason than it received eleven oscars including best picture.	4.0	A must see	2004-05-19	7	2	5

Everybody leaves... satisfied. The adventure is engrossing, and let's just say the ending is a major tearjerker. I don't tear up at movies,but this one got my eyes all teary.""Return"" resumes where ""Two Towers"" ends. Frodo and Sam go deeper into Mordor. In the meantime, Aragorn is asserting his kingship and rallying the troops. Denethor sends his son Faramir on a suicide mission. Aragorn,Legolas,and Gimli also take the Paths of the Dead,to help the ghostly warriors seek release. Aragorn himself is torn between his betrothed the elven,immortal Arwen and the earthly,human Eowyn. Merry and Eowyn--both banned from the battlefield--find comfort in each other (sorry,NOT THAT WAY) There are also the two sexiest sequences in the series--Frodo's romantic vision of Galadriel,and then Frodo,shirtless,in Cirith Ungol. The whole epic is pure gold--but that scene in Cirith Ungol--is gilding the lily,the cherry atop the cake,the frosting on the cake. It's,um,that good.""Return"" basically ends with a triple wedding. There's a double wedding of Aragorn to Arwen, Faramir to Eowyn, and in the Shire, Sam to Rose. Frodo goes westward because Galadriel gives him a come hither look at the Grey Havens (THAT'S a happy ending) Sam finds comfort in the domestic life. It's worth noting for all its epic battles and royalty,it's basically about the home and the family. (Fangirls might be annoyed at the heteronormativity of the ending--but that's what the internet is for!) The movie also ends with Frodo's narration. For anyone who's curious, Elijah Wood has done the ""moral of this story"" ending (sorta like the ones at the end of '80s He-Man/She-Ra/GI Joe cartoons) narrations for ""The Faculty"",""Green Street Hooligans"",and back in the day,""The Good Son.""

"When I first went to see ""Return of the King"", I eventually gave up and walked out of the theater two hours into the movie. Last week I finally had to see the final hour and a half, just to satisfy my curiosity (mostly just to finally see Gollum suffer a well-deserved death) and rented the DVD. Then I remembered why I was so frustrated and impatient in the theater the first time. This is the most overblown, bloated, and exagerated hogwash I've ever been coerced into sitting through in my entire life. It makes the mediocre ""Titanic"" seem like an artistic masterpiece. It could almost inspire me to see second-class trash like ""Bad Santa"", although ""Return of the King"" is far more tortuous because of its incredible never-ending length. Sitting through an afternoon tea at the Plaza Hotel with Margaret Thatcher and John McCain would be easier than enduring this. And if I have to see bulbuous-eyed Frodo forgive that green double-crossing midget ring-lover Gollum one more time, before he vanishes into the boiling lava (finally--a merciful death for moviegoers if there ever was one) or watch another hammy gaze or hammy expression of the immensely hammy and cheesy Viggo Mortensen, I just might throw up. It's amazing the depths that standards have sunk to when this pathetic trash melodrama is given eleven Academy Awards! Ben-Hur deserved it, but never this crap. If you want to see what a great movie can be, rent the DVD of Gone With the Wind or Chinatown or The Black Stallion or The Magnificent Ambersons. If it weren't such a travesty, the fact that this film is hyped as ""a great epic"" would be just a joke.

I saw it on STARZ! on Saturday night, on Sunday afternoon, and I'll watch it again on Tuesday night.  I know that the movie is only BASED on JRR Tolkien's books, but I hope that the extended version shows what happened to Saruman and Wormtongue, since the book talked about their demise on the way to the Shire.  The movie never showed them after the flooding of Isengard.I also think that even though Tolkien left Shelob's eventual fate unmentioned, it would have been nice if Peter Jackson actually included a scene where Samwise actually kills her instead of just wounding her.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3ELG7HJO76K3O	"Amazon Customer ""Flower'sFriend"""	"This title of this third book of the Trilogy. Tolkien wanted to call it the War of the Ring but the Publishing company picked The Return of the King. Both Titles are a good description of this story. The Return of the Heir of the old Kings as Aragorn the Heir of Isildur (The one who cut the One Ring from Sauron in the opening of the first film) comes to save Minas Tirith (Capital City of Gondor) from the Wrath of Sauron's Assault and Claim the Kingship.This is when the real part of the War gets started. Sauron was just setting things up in the first 2 films. Saruman and His Army yes was huge but Saruman could not really Rival Sauron unless he had got the Ring. Sauron's Armies are much bigger plus He has the Nine Nazgul that you saw in the Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers. As you saw in Towers they now Ride upon Winged Beasts.Sauron will use these Evil Ghost in His Great War that He has been preparing. The Lord of these Nine Riders the Lord of the Nazgul (the one who wounded Frodo in the Fellowship of the Ring) will lead the Armies of Sauron to destroy Minas Tirith. Gandalf will arrive at Minas Tirith to where Denethor the second the Lord and Steward (the line of the Stewards have long held the place for the line of the Kings until they Return) of Gondor is to get ready for the upcoming assault from Sauron. (Denethor is also the Farther of Boromir and Faramir.) Theoden and Eomer with the Men of Rohan will come to the aid of Minas Tirith also while Aragorn will come but he will take a different Path.The Great Battle of the Pelennor Fields is what the Battle at Minas Tirith will be called and it will make Helms Deep seem like a nice walk in the park. There are supposed to be way more Orcs at this Battle. Also if you noticed in the Two Towers Evil Men called Easterlings (the ones Frodo saw at the Black Gate) and the Southrons or Haradrim (the ones Frodo saw before he was taken by Farmer) they where Gathering together for this Great War that Sauron was getting ready to unleash and they should be at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. There should be 200,000 strong lead by the Witch-King to attack Minas Tirith.  Also Great Ships of Evil Pirates will also be coming to attack Minas Tirith.The Lord of the Nazgul (The Witch-King) few in Gondor will stand and abide even the rumor of his coming. For He is a Dreadful enemy and even his own servants fear him. There hope will lie with Frodo and Sam but Gollum will lead them to Cirith Ungol a place of Dreadful Rumor where a Dark Terror Dwells. Remember at the end of the Two Towers where Gollum said ""we could get her to do it for us "" ? Well she is the Dark Terror that Dwells in the pass of Cirith Ungol but what she is I will not say, but you will find out in the next film (or you can read the last part's of the Two Towers. ) Yes she is in the Two Towers books but for movie she is getting pushed back to Return of the King) and this will be an Evil Trick by Gollum to get the Ring backAlso (and I think this shall be the worst part) the Ring will really start to overtake Frodo more so in the Return of the King then in the Two Towers. I really can't say how it will overtake him, since I don't want to give too much away.Gandalf the White will have the task of keeping the Eye of Sauron on them in the Great War of the Ring. By doing this he will be keeping the Eye of the enemy away from Frodo and Sam to give Frodo a chance to complete his task and cast the Ring into the Cracks of Doom. But the chances of Frodo doing this will seem like the chances of seeing Snow in South-Florida in July."	5.0	The Eye of Sauron Strikes	2003-09-28	11	7	4
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A22ZJTTFZFCUTV	"Amazon Customer ""gdawg007"""	"This movie is amazing. Some critics have said it lacked the emotion of the first film and focused mainly on combat and less on characters.  But I think when the Rohirim charge over the field of orcs it shows something of Theoden's character, especially in his speech before they charge.  And Aragorn's ""For Frodo"" charge, while not in the book, shows his total belief and faith in the path laid before him and his trust in Frodo to truly end the conflict.  Then there are the interactions between Sam, Frodo and Gollum.  The trio deserves Academy awards for their amazing performances.  The emotional state of Denethor is not difficult to see either.  Gandalf is perfectly portrayed as the stern yet wise wizard who leads the people of middle earth on, even when his advice seems unwise.  He truly encompasses Tolkien's views on how the world changed from WWI and WWII and how the nature of war itself changed because of them.  Gimli and Legolas' characters are the only ones that got a little undercut.  While he and Legolas are representative characters and do not have as much growth in the story as the rest do, it is sad that Gimli becomes the comic relief dwarf and Legolas the one who lets the audience know exactly what they are fighting (orcs!) and then performs some over the top fighting sequence.  It would be nice to see a little more of their growth too, but then again, we already have five characters undergoing major changes, to add two more might just bog the whole thing down.  The additional scenes with Eowyn are great and provide more growth for a character that was underdone in the books, if you ask me.  Arwen again feels like she's there solely because they paid so much for Liv that they had to use her, but still Jackson keeps her character relevant and well portrayed.  Elrond too gets more screen time in the movie than he has in the book, but he does take the place of several other characters and it would've been a shame not to see more of Hugo Weaving.  Merry and Pippen are also well done if not perfectly.  You get a real sense of just how big everything must seem to these little people.  Overall, character growth is well done.As for the adaptation of the original material, a movie and a book are two very different forms of media, and the two cannot and should not be compared. The books are great, and so are the movies, but they are apples and oranges. The omissions of certain scenes from the theatrical release will not doubt make their way into the extended version, such as the confrontation of Saruman, the use of the Palantir by Denethor, and possibly even the small romance between Faramir and Eowyn. Peter Jackson has confirmed the first one, and the last one seems hinted at since Faramir and Eowyn are standing next to each other at the end. The second is not necessary, but it would be nice to see.  I would love to see the Orc Chieften's death scene, although it would require much work on Peter Jackson's part to portray, as it is not a major scene in the book.  Over all, the additions to the extended version should be plenty and will make the movie even more satisfying for all.The special effects are obviously amazing and the battle scenes leave nothing to the imagination.  The Rohirim's attack on the Haradim is one of the best scenes in the movie, as is the siege of Minas Tirith.  Shelob looks perfectly creepy and people in the theater cringed at the sight of her.As for the numerous endings, it would've been unheard of it Peter Jackson had ended it with the destruction of the ring, and simply had a voice over tell us what happened to the characters. It would've been equally unfulfilling of they ended with Aragorn becoming king. To show that Frodo could not live the rest of his life in the shire was important to his character, and needed to be presented in contrast to Sam, who was totally content to live out his days fully involved in Hobbiton. And if the movie did not end with Sam saying the final lines of the book, people would be up in arms. Peter Jackson had a difficult task with the ending of Return of the King because it wasn't just an ending to a movie; it was an ending to all three films.  And he pulls it off with amazing skill, something to rival even the greatest of filmmakers.  This can be said for all three films, a true treasure that will hopefully be revered as such for many years to come.You must see this movie if you haven't, and the whole trilogy if you haven't.  There are no excuses for not seeing them."	5.0	Obviously I haven't seen the DVD yet	2004-03-23	11	10	1

Also, beware of serious geekness committed by yours truly...I saw the ROTK EE with a couple buddies last Friday. 50 minutes of extra footage. Unlike the first two movies most of the extra footage here were in very small almost not noticeable increments.There were a couple larger scenes. The most prominent was the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf and company. This was pretty good. They basically threw in what happened at the Scouring at this scene.  I was glad to see the plot with Saruman get finished but I didn't like the way they ended it.Added in also was footage of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas in the Halls of the Dead. Instead of the scene ending with Aragorn asking the allegiance of the Undead, it continues on with the Undead initially rejecting Aragorns plea and then accepting it about 3 minutes later after Peter Jackson pulls out an Indiana Jones type scene.Other tidbits were just more humor scenes. Totally not needed and I think it kinda butchers the story. Any fan who has read the books know the seriousness of what was happening. Trial came first, joy came at the end.Really, only a couple of the scenes added in were faithful to the books....the love between Faramir and Eowyn, the troubled relationship between Faramir and Denethor and then Aragorn confronting Sauron with the Palantir.The Mouth of Sauron was ok too but even that bugged me because after Aragorn kills the Mouth and the new footage goes back to the original footage, you no longer see the body of the Mouth. BAD EDITING!Oh, and the standoff between the Witch King and Gandalf was horrendous. They didn't even make it somewhat of a battle. You telling me that one of the great Maia (Gandalf) couldn't stand for more than a couple seconds against one of Saurons spawn when in ""The Hobbit"" Gandalf was able to stand against Sauron himself? Please...All in all....I am pretty disappointed. I think this movie was the best of the trilogy but I prefer the other two extended editions. I will still end up buying it just because I have the first two and I want to complete the collection. But if I watch ROTK again it will probably be the theatrical release."	3.0	Average - First two EE's for FOTR and TT were better	2004-12-20	29	23	6
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AMIGVTZZIWS6I	Amazon Customer	"Return of the King is by far the best of the three movies in this trilogy -- hands down!  There are moments of true drama in this film that really tug at the emotions of the viewer:  the troubled relationship between Faramir and his father; the unrequited love of Eowyn for Aragorn; the reluctant warrior Theoden; the interaction between Gandalf and Pip; the sadness of Gollum; and of course, the heroic friendship between Sam and Frodo (which packs the most emtional impact in the entire movie).  This movie deserved every Academy Award it received, and Sean Astin deserved one for his portrayal of Sam.  Peter Jackson has done a wonderful job with this trilogy and I have no doubt these three films will have the staying power of the first Star War trilogy, and last for decades to come.  A note on the additional scenes:  I didn't really feel like they added much this time around.  With the other films, Jackson added new material that better explained events in the respective films, but with this movie they just seemed like nothing more than ""extras"" or ""deleted scenes"" you find on most DVDs.  They didn't take away from the overall film, but they added very little.  Regardless, this special addition is a must-have for any Tolkien fan, any fan of the Lord of the Rings.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1EQZQ5BY3TXPG	"Amazon Customer ""NoirDame.com"""	"If you haven't read Tolkien and are unconvinced, here's my confession. Somehow, despite lovingly reading all the Chronicles of Narnia by the age of 11 (written by close Tolkien friend and fellow 'Inkling' C.S.Lewis), repeatedly patronizing an Ann Arbor store called ""Middle Earth"", and having ""Misty Mountain Hop"" as partial soundtrack to my life, I had never read Tolkien. My first experience was with the dreadful and convoluted 1970s animated film ""LOTR"", and it turned me off the books.I've since learned that Tolkien actually hoped that children would wait before reading ""Lord of the Rings"", having written ""The Hobbit"" for kids, but believing that adults would better savor his epic.We now live in a different ""visual"" time, saturated with ""Maxim"" magazine, video games, and shallow reality TV like ""Newlyweds"" and ""Average Joe,"" showing that poor judgment is alive and well in America. If Tolkien were alive today, seeing how much more sophisticated the average child is, and the spiritual emptiness of so much entertainment ... perhaps he want them to have the benefit of his books, and his ideas, at an earlier age.In essence, when you consider how the film industry has splintered, seemingly into ""art-house Oscar fare"" (released in November) and ""lowest common denominator"" pictures, Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Phillipa Bowens and their many collaborators should be commended for making not one but three films that are about ""Something"" - a stunning undertaking filled with ideas and ideals, visually gorgeous with great performances. After seeing ""Two Towers,"" I began to read Tolkien. While his epic's essence and very language can't be fully translated to the silver screen, these films come close. If ""Babylon 5"", heavily influenced by LOTR, forever challenged the conventions and reset the bar for science fiction television, these films have challenged not just fantasy films, but modern cinema itself...its recent lack of originality, spirit and vibrancy. You can bet Jackson has lit a fire in scores of would-be filmmakers.While ""Fellowship of the Ring"" sets up the quest, and ""The Two Towers"" deepens the journey into an ever-widening war, ""Return of the King"" is about friendship, love, loyalty and compassion.Much, much more historical and ""weighty"" than ""Star Wars,"" and much more optimistic and uplifting than your typical historical film or Arthurian legend (""Excalibur"", ""Braveheart""), there is something for everyone here.Some people will be deeply touched by Frodo's journey in this last film, and how it transforms his sense of self and outlook, aging him subtly but permanently. And critics and media stories have focused on Gollum, and Andy Sedaris' performance. As I watched it, though, it was Sean Astin's ""Sam"" that was my anchor in Middle Earth. Astin supposedly gained weight, after he was told by an agent he would lose the part otherwise - and there have been comparisons to Dr. Watson and other ""sidekicks"", as if he is another burden to Frodo, on top of the ring. On the ""Two Towers"" CD, Phillipa Boyens talks about the relationship between British officers and their 'valets' and how that might have influenced Tolkien - then reiterated that Sam is Frodo's equal, or at least Frodo sees him as so.In fact, while the ""heroes"" - and cinematic sex symbols - Frodo, Aragon, Legolas, Boromir and Faromir - are to some or full degree *chosen* or inheritors of this quest - Sam solely participates out of friendship and protectiveness for Frodo. There's something beautiful in that, so rarely seen in the movies, which completely dwarfs Sam's ""dumpiness"" factor. (A movie about friendship, particularly between men, is often categorized as ""homoerotic"" - even Rick's comment to Renault in ""Casablanca"" comes in for this goofiness - unfair to friendship, unfair to gays, who deserve more than tepid representation in the movies).Meanwhile, Orlando Bloom is a beautiful young man, but Legolas seems to be a character to whom heroism and grace comes easily, making him much less interesting as a *film* character. This quest is not so easy for the humans, much less the hobbits.  Sam's platonic dedication to Frodo is echoed in Eowyn's love for her father, her wish to save him emanating from a pure place in her heart, which we know is not automatically rewarded in reality, even in Middle Earth. Pippen's character blossoms, given the chance for redemption and bravery.Watching the battle scenes from further away, when we see the Hobbits' and Eowyn's diminutive statures, I kept thinking what a thrill this must be for pre-teens watching - seeing that someone small, young or lacking in experience can still make a difference, still do something great. (That's half the appeal of Harry Potter in a nutshell - although some critics claim Rowling's another Inkling in waiting, too!)It is the theme of sacrifice, for a loved one or for love and life itself, that elevates this movie. It's a feel-good movie that makes you think and brings tears to your eyes, without a single false note. Having it released during the holiday season, a time to reflect on spirituality and loved ones, makes it an even greater gift from the filmmakers. Cheers!"	5.0	Didn't read the books first?

Maligned by some for being a little protracted toward the end, and running over 3hrs and 15 minutes this is certainly filmed on an epic scale. Some criticism from purists with regard to the transition from page to screen, were I feel also a little misplaced as this will surely become known as the definitive version of a great work of literature, and is in it's own right cinematic history at over 4 years in the making.This film (like the two that preceded it) has everything: - love, action, adventure, emotion, sadness and the list goes on. Superbly acted, directed, and written, I cannot recommend this film enough. Those who enjoyed the other movies will feel more than a little sadness at the end of this trilogy, which although it seemed frustrating at having to wait a year for each installment to come along, has left us without anything to seemingly look forward too. Some excellent DVD extra's on disc two, including the promotion of the extended version later this year round out the disc set well, and this will certainly be a worthy addition to any collection.

Unlike the first two, the movie was not drawn together by broad lengthed battle scenes. I also liked how this movie actually contain all the elements a good movie would, comedy (the laughing in bed scene, or the Sam and Frodo posse, and even Gandalf-pure comic relief), romance (though somehow not deep romance, but its there),characters overcoming their obstacles to mature their position, a plot that was straightforward and not cut out, random people with problems, drawn out death scenes, and trying to build from the novel with the creativity of the director. Though there were plenty of scenes missing from the book.So in this version I hope it includes the Battle of Baywater (or when the Hobbits get home, and see it taken over by ruffians and Saruman), or the scene where Aragorn rescues injured patients with a magical herb. But I'll have to see how it goes.	5.0	Great Movie, but could this be the real novel-ty	2004-10-04	81	15	66

M Robertson ""brother_entropy"""	I remember watching some of Peter Jacksons previous movies, Bad Taste, Dead Alive, and Meet the Feebles.  When I heard that he was helming this very ambitious project I was a bit suprised and worried.  But when I saw the final project of Fellowship of the Ring I was pleasantly suprised.  I was a big fan of the books and despite the minor changes, he hit it right on.This was an excellent retelling of the Return of the King, one of the slower moving of the three books.  There were changes and omissions, some of which I hear are going to be on the special edition of the dvd, this is the desperate to have it version.High PointsSmeagol/Gollums history, an interesting way to start the movie.Shilob, the spider woman, not what I envisioned, but it was a creepy ass scene none the less.The depiction of Minas Tirith, I liked the Greek Roman style they used.  I may be wrong on that since the history of architecture isn't one of my specialties.The battle of Minas Tirith, I know it is CGI, but that is the biggest cavalry charge I have ever seen in a movie.  It was also nice to finally see what the olyphants were going to do in battle.The breakdown of Sam, Frodo, and Gollumn.The madness in the Regent of Minas Tirith.There isn't much else that I can say that will sway opinions one way or another.  Just see this movie, the only acceptable reason to wait would be for the special edition.	5.0	don't get much better	2004-05-27	1	1	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1OHN5GNVBZKF4	Amy Gillespie	(...)George Lucas was, I believe, in grade school when JRR Tolkien published these books.  When one is portraying the human struggles of good vs evil, one often uses fairly universal themes and types of characters--perhaps you didn't notice this in high school english.  How fortunate Mr. Lucas did.  As for your, ahem, critique of the special effects, I guess I haven't seen a whole lot of your superior work in theaters lately.  In closing, Peter Jackson has said that they decided to create Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth, which I believe they have.  If you have problem with basic content, the multiple endings, and length, perhaps it is just as well that you haven't read the books--they'd go over your head.	5.0	A Bit of History...	2004-04-15	7	4	3

We watch the videos over and over, and my two children have most of the lines memorized.  We could not wait for this movie to come out, so we could see how the producers could top the first two.  They did!!!  Although, there are lots of things left out of the movies from the books, to me, there is much more added to the movies that makes them better than the books (if I may dare say that).  The final part of the trilogy, Return of the King, is a battle of Biblical proportions, an epic story of good versus evil which gives me chills to think of the Spiritual implications and symbolism of this movie (and the first two).  Now, we can't wait for this movie to come out on video/DVD so we can watch it over and over again!  It's fantastic, and, if you can imagine, even more captivating and stunningly beautiful than the first two!  I love the cast, as well.  They are fabulous, each one!  I would highly recommend seeing the first two in order, if you haven't done so, before seeing this film, but I would recommend the trilogy to anyone from action fans to love story fans to sci-fi fans, and the writers even throw in a bit of comedy, as well.  There's no profanity or nudity or lewdness.  There is violence, but what do you expect when you are trying to rid Middle-Earth of the evil Dark Lord??? Even at that, it is tastefully done to enhance the theme of the film! Thank you for reading this review and letting me express how much I have enjoyed LOTR...all 3 of them!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AFFYQ0XWO20W3	"Ana Sedai ""Ana"""	"Alas, all good things must come to an end, and on December 14, the last milestone in a four-year-long (or decade-long, depending on who you ask) odyssey will be passed.  The release of the extended edition of ROTK is arguably the most anticipated DVD event of the whole year, and with good reason.  I'm assuming that everyone who is interested this early has read about the extra goodies we can expect from Jackson and Co.  Things like the Mouth of Sauron, the orc-march with Sam and Frodo, and (my personal favorite) the blossoming relationship between Eowyn and Faramir, not to mention a whole host of others.  I guess the Extended Editions prove the exception to the rule that less is more.  50 extra minutes is a long time, even compared with the original hefty running time of 3 1/2 hours.  I'm heartily anticipating the numbing my rear is going to receive.When you think about it, The Lord of the Rings should never have happened.  At least, not in this day and age.  We're talking about an unknown director, with no previous experience in epic filmaking, a special effects workhouse in *New Zealand*, of all places, and a smallish production company that really couldn't afford to make a gamble of this magnitude and expect to recover if they lost.  Still, Jackson certainly made sure they got their money's worth, even before the movies became hits.  He made three movies, each over 3 hours long, with copious special effects and a huge cast, for $300 million.  Titanic, a single movie, while admittedly a very ambitious one, had a price tag of about $400 million.  I have no idea how Jackson did it, and I don't need to know.  Even if he never makes another movie as good as LOTR (God forbid!), he will go down in filmaking history as the man who was able to translate an untranslateable classic to the big screen, and still do it justice.  How many ""serious"" directors can claim that feat, even with less ambitious books?Now, for those who claim LOTR is a lesson for our time, you may very well be right.  Then again, you might not.  Either way, it really doesn't matter.  We all see what we want to see, but I think I'll trust the author's view in this case.  Tolkien was famously contemptuous of allegory, and the least we can do for him is to honor his request that the books (and the movies) be read and seen for themselves, without bringing our own prejudices and justifications into it, at least not on purpose.So, here's to the final leg of the journey.  The most awe-inspiring visual representation that will ever be seen of one of the world's greatest books will be complete in just over two months.  Mark your calenders, folks!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AHY9EY9HGQTP6	Andrew Freborg	"A modern Wagnerian-like treasure; and like the staging of Wagner's ""Ring"" -- a true perfection of vision is impossible to achieve; but the enjoyment comes in the experience and churning of the mind the experience creates.I have to admit overall I expected more from the extended release (maybe from being spoiled by FOTR and TTT), and I think it was a bit hyped. Also I can't quench an underlying feeling of being manipulated by Jackson ... The extended version flows so well, and I can't rationalize why some of the restored OUTSTANDING scenes were cut in the first place (i.e. Saruman and Grima at Orthanc, Frodo and Sam ""recruited"" into the Orc army, Mouth of Sauron); While lame ""Hollywood-esque"" stuff with Arwen/Aragorn was left in place, esp. now after seeing the restored version (I'm sorry, but I found the Liv Tyler scenes annoying)- I just get the feeling Jackson cut what he did as a ""teaser"" and a good marketing tool, knowing droves of die-hards (like my wife and I) would of course jump for the DVD :-).The absolute gems of the extended version are the restored Saruman scene -- Christopher Lee is amazing! (what a voice), and the additional development of Theoden and Eowyn -- Bernhard Hill and Miranda Otto are understated treasures and incredible. I don't get all the hype about Orlando Bloom; his acting and the overall characterization of Legolas was wooden, and I found the running gag of killing competition between him and Gimli very wearing (how cares). Opinions are a dime a dozen, but here is my take on the restoration (partially influenced by my Tolkien ""nut"" wife too :-))POSITIVES- Saruman and Wormtongue at OrthancVery powerful: Saruman plays psych. games with Theoden and Gandalf. Sarumans motivations are clarified, And Bernhard Hill is very moving as an angered and ashamed leader. Also, Grima is made a bit more sympathetic.- Gandalf/Pippin in initial confrontation with DenethorNice exposition on the fall of the Kingdom of Men while leaving the citadel (makes the Middle Earth world more ""real"")- Faramir and PippinDavid Wenham becomes a much more sypmathetic Faramir, and I think the scene is good for deeper character development for both Faramir and Pippin.- House of HealingPrb. to ""slow"" for cinema, but would actually have liked to see more in this scene. David Wenham and Miranda Otto play very well against each other.- Grond and GothmogThe enhanced Gothmog and Grond sequences are terrific - esp. the scene where Gothmog fights Eowyen and then hunts her down.NEGATIVES- The Witch King/Gandalf confrontation was good (glad it was added), but underdeveloped and rushed.- ""Macho"" LegolasOrlando Bloom is wooden, Legolas comes off as swashbuckling eye candy and his removal from Jacksons setting I don't think would take much away from the movie (not case with book)- Army of the DeadThe skulls scene is silly- Cirith UngolNobody mentions the absence of the ""Watchers"" at the gate of the tower, where Sam has to use the Galadriel vial to be able to pass. Would like to have had more and more ""Tolkien"" Cirith Ungol and less ""swashbuckling.""- Aragorn and Sauron (Palantir)So what? No prior context with Sauron and Aragron -- its been all Sauron and Frodo.- Mouth of SauronCool scene, again given short shrift (like the Witch-King confrontation. Aragorn beheading the Mouth under a truce flag is ""dishonorable"" and cheapens his character.I'm ambivalent on the Scouring of the Shire -- though my purist wife was very disapointed it wasn't included. BOTH of us were glad Tom Bombadil was removed.One other ""wish"" --- a further enhanced prologue on the Second Age with Gil-Galad, Elendil et. al. in the first film."	4.0	"Modern ""Wagnerian"" Treasure"	2004-12-16	9	8	1

This is, without doubt, the best picture of the year, and anything less than that from the *Academy* would be a grave disappointment.Peter Jackson, with grace, deference, and a masterful hand, has directed three of the best films of our time. The ending to this film trilogy is a far cry from disappointment, or even mediocrity!Fans of the Tolkien's original masterpiece will remain admirable of Jackson at how true his direction stays to the books. Special effects afficionados will marvel at the stunning, epic proportions of the beautiful Middle Earth landscapes, heart-pounding battle sequences, and all the rest of the magnificent visual wizardry present throughout this film.The characterizations, performed by a fine cast, are never overdone, and are presented in this astounding mythic tale with near Shakespearean quality.The Return of the King is far and away, the best installment of the trilogy, and possibly the best studio release of the year.I know nothing comparable to it except HBO's equally beautiful and fascinating mini-series, Angels in America.The Return of the King is the final chapter in the legendary Lord of the Rings saga.

I wish that I could find a better word to start off this review, but after searching my brain, I am unfortunately left with only ""wow"".  I'm not saying that this movie isn't worthy of wow, rather, it deserves so much more.  Peter Jackson's genius is finally, after two years of production, and three years wait for viewers, brought full circle (get it?).  This final chapter tells the story of the last fight for Middle-Earth; the people of Gondor and Rohan must unite in order to save their lands from evil, and leading them is Gandalf the wizard, Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, Th&eacute;oden the king of Rohan, and Aragorn, the man who is the heir of the king of Gondor.  However, Lord Sauron of Mordor has assembled an army so great that not even all the soldiers in the world could hope to achieve victory.  And there is another problem.  Ever since Isildur (Aragorn's ancestor) was killed some millenia ago, the land of Gondor has been in the hands of the stewards, who are the caretakers of the throne.  The current steward Denethor, who is the father of Boromir and Faramir, has gone mad, and has lost all ability to defend his nation.  While all of this is going on, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, who is now plotting against the other two, are moving ever closer to Mt. Doom.  Now they have no choice but to carry on, for if they die, the ring will be right within Sauron's grasp.  If the ring is returned to him, it will be the end of Middle-Earth.There are very few words that can do a movie like this justice.  It's scope is grand, it's story is timeless, and it's cast and crew couldn't have been better.  The special effects are also amazing; Gollum looks even better than he did in The Two Towers, which is saying a lot.  Speaking of Gollum, I was a little worried that they weren't going to elaborate on how he became the thing he is today, but fortunately, the opening sequence tells his story.I guess the only thing that I am a little upset about is that we don't get any closure on Saruman.  We don't see what happened to him, so we have to assume that he has died.  Oh well, this was a 3 1/2 hour movie; I guess that he will be in the extended edition.This final chapter is definitely the best of the three, but you must realize that these films are not supposed to be individual, rather they are one movie broken into three parts.  With that mindset I must say that, without a doubt, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best movies ever made, or that ever will be made."	5.0	The Epic Ends...

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3TZQNYSL8SZFM	"Andrew ""rewster"""	"One of the best movies of this era easily. If you have been reading other reviews then the upsides are almost a given: astounding CGI, huge battle scenes, amazing portrayal of Gollum and Shelob, truly emotional endings etc... But just for my take on these things here we go.Many have said that the CGI in these movies is just annoying,obvious, or ugly. I whole heartedly disagree with this claim because in my opinion CGI is the only way to realize tolkiens words on scree. Tolkien describes hundreds of thousands of orcs attacking minas tirith, how in the world could that be done practically? Hire the entire population of wellington, NZ? Probably not. Also, shelob looks magnificent and would not look so realitic if she was rubber or a puppey. Gollum continues to amaze me now with even more facial structure and small detatails not seen in TTT that truly add to his believabilty and make him just another actor. Serkis conveys great emotion and character in Gollum in the film making him one of my faveorite characters.As for the emotion of the film it is really amazing. I am not an outwardly emotional person but i had tears in my eyes during sam and frodos scenes in Minas Morgul and Mount Doom.Now then, after reading some of the bad reviews of this title i just want to interject some thought on the ""bad"" things about this movie.First of all Saruman being cut is not necassarily smart but if you want to see him then rent the extended cut coming out at the end of this year. He was obviosly not impotrtant to this part of the story. Infact in the books he tries to persuade people to join him but gandalf breaks his staff and wormtongue throws the palentir which is the only part of this scene which changes the story in any way. Therefore it was not a hard scene to cut.Also the houses of healing must be on the extended cut as well and unless you care a lot about seeing another reasons Aragorn is the rightful king they arn't needed by the non tolkien enthusiest.As to people who complain about how easily the orcs were defeated with the coming of the Army of the Dead, it was made a necassary change from the books by the screenwriters. First of all, in the book there was an Army but they only conquered the ports where the Black Ships of Umbar were in order to allow Aragorn and co with i belive at least a thousand new troops recruited from surrounding villages to take said ships to the battle. However tolkien had a bit less Orcs at the battle allowing this small troop to being the reason for Saurons defeat. Jackson upped the number a bit meaning he needed the army of the dead to win the battle. These are the reasons (pretty resonable reason in my opinion) for the triumph of the Army of the dead.I only list these faults becuase i wanted to explain to people who are angered by them why they shouldn't be.Anyway brief summary of what to expect from the movie: Aragorn Legolas, Gandalf and Gimli must travel to Minas Tirith stronghold of men to prepare for battle against Sauron. While this is happening Frodo Sam and Gollum travel through Minas morgul on their way to try to destroy the one ring of power and bring down the evil in Middle-earth.The theatrical DVD is not the definitive version but if you are like me you will buy it anyway just for the small amount of behind the scenes stuff and the movie itself to own it for four months before buying the EE in November with at least 10 hrs of behind the seensSo all in all wonderful movie mostly true to the books and amazing visual effects.

I just feel that Two Towers is much better done.  In ROTK, some of the computer graphics were sloppy, like the olephaunts....  My biggest complaint for ROTK is that there are too many close-ups and ""slow-motions"", especially in the beginning.  They really interrupted the flow of the movie.Minas Tirith is breathtaking and the battle scenes are great too.  There are trolls, catapults and Nazguls....  The part I like most is when Theoden was lining up his horsemen before the battle at Pelennor Field.  He banged his sword on his men's spears.  The sound effect really got my blood pumping.  I know some people don't like the battle scenes, calling them ""eye-candies"".  I'd disagree.  What is so mesmerizing about them is the sheer multitude:  horses charging into a thick wall of orcs, horses looking like ants running between the olephaunts.  (I really love the horse scenes....)  Peter Jackson wants us to see those eye-candies.  Why else would he devote like two hours for the battles?For the Tolkien loyalists who think that Jackson missed the point of the book, I think they should remember this is Jackson's LOTR.  This is Jackson's vision of the Middle Earth--the Shire, the Rohirrims and Minas Tirith....  Rather than complain about what's not faithful to the book, think what Jackson had achieved."	4.0	I Still Think Two Towers Is Better	2004-02-15	6	2	4

From the opening sequence until the screen faded to black at the end, I couldn't move from my seat. This was the best movie I can remember seeing...ever. The acting was superb (Viggo Mortensen was breathtaking in his ability to portray reluctant nobility) the emotions hard to watch, the battle scenes fought but not over-bloody... and there was no use of foul language, no sex, and no overt, unnecessary violence. It was WAR, not shoot-em-up-for-fun kind of battle in these films. The romantic element was not overplayed, the friendships were incredible to see unfold (especially in the jaded society in which we now live) and the loyalty was impossible to miss. I have gone back twice since to watch this movie again (something I have NEVER done), and would gladly watch it again, and again... I can't wait until it comes out in DVD!I've read the books, and though there are things portrayed somewhat differently from the book throughout the movie, the basic story is the same. The time element and what it would take to make a movie from that entire, HUGE book was why much was cut from the story I'm sure, but it's refreshing to know that the important things in it were not lost in translation from paper to film.The scenery is breathtaking, the visual effects so real that you find yourself taking a second look...or a third... and the score is enough to hold you captive in and of itself. If you're a fan of Tolkien, don't miss this film if you can help it, especially on the big screen. I wish I'd seen the first two in the theater, now.Hooray to Peter Jackson, to the cast, crew and all involved in making this truly wonderful, epic drama!	5.0	Best I've seen in years...!	2004-02-06	3	2	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A47OISX4AV8I	AngelosOne	Well, the extended edition runs at a whooping 250 minutes (that's about 4 hours boys and girls) and you'll be surprised that when you are watching it, none of it drags so as to make you realize the insane amount of time it'll take to watch it.The extended scenes for the most part, are nice to have because they further flesh out the characters (such as the house of healing-Eowyn meeting Faramir).  Some, I'm quite puzzled as to why they were not included in the theatrical release, since they are quite good, and would have helped make the movie better, such as Gandalf's meeting with the Witch King.  Others were a bit silly, such as the drinking contest scene; don't get me wrong, it's quite funny, especially Gimli's nutty remark, but kind of superflous.  Instead, I don't understand why Peter Jackson didn't use that scene to follow the books little game between Eomer and Gimli, regarding Gimli's claim that Eomer admit Lady Galadriel was the most beautiful female he's ever seen or he'll cut off his head; for those who've never read the books, it ends when Eomer finally sees Galadriel at the end of the book, but tells Gimli to cut his head off becasue he cannot say it. Gimli asks why, and Eomer answers that he thinks Arwen is the most beautiful.  Gimli concedes, saying that Eomer has chosen the night, while he prefers the day- an allegory to the ladies' respective hair color.The extras were pretty interesting too.  Many documentaries about the filming, cast accounts, and other tidbits about what went on behind the scenes.  It was especiall nice to see what happened with the horses, and it did give me a warm fuzzy when I heard about Vigo's kind gesture to one of the horse rider doubles.It was amazing to think that Peter Jackson was still working on the film only a few weeks before it was released worldwide.  One of the documentaries really shows the pressure many of the people working on this film felt; they were even a bit harsh with each other at some points :0It was also a nice surprise to find out that the actor playing Pippin (hopefully I'm not getting my hobbits mixed up) wrote and actually sang the song in the Steward of Gondor's hall.If you are like me, and has collected all the extended edition versions of this trilogy (those nifty fake book covers make them so nice), you'll find that inside, there is a coupon with an offer for a case cover for all 3 extended edition films.A must buy for anyone who liked the films and who just wants to see more of Middle Earth.	5.0	A perfect ending......	2005-02-17	9	8	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AHTO4B5TCAMIE	Ann A.	"Like so many LOTR fans, I was sobbing way before the end credits started rolling. I think the first tear fell at Aragorn's coronation and it kept going while at the same time getting louder.I loved the multiple endings. It gave closure to many of the questions I had for I had never read the books (although I am doing that right now starting with ""The Hobbit""). Truthfully, I didn't want it to end. I was afraid for it to end. But when it did, I cried all the more harder. RotK &lt;i>is&lt;/i> the most dramatic of the three. It really tears at your heart.Although the movie is three hours long, it really just felt like it was only an hour and a half long. From the very beginning you're engrossed in the film.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3JZPZ889JOUYX	anonymous	"The ROTK EE is fantastic.  It is the best of the three movies and the best of the three extended versions.  The new scenes added make up for a long scene-selection list of seventy-eight scenes.  Cow holy.  It is four hours and ten minutes long, just about.  Since the new scenes include Saruman and Wormtongue (this scene is awesome, with some great dialogue and effects, including Saruman's staff shattering, Wormtongue dying, Saruman falling to a gruesome death, etc.), the credits with the pictures of each character have been altered, and Christopher Lee and Brad Dourif now appear.The new scenes are fantastic, the best in my opinion being the additional Paths of the Dead stuff, the Mouth of Sauron, new Minas Tirith shots, and the Witch King/Gandalf fight, in which you actually do witness the Lord of the Nazgul completely defeating Gandalf, just as he promised (""I will break him"").  Don't worry, the White Wizard doesn't die... There's some new Legolas and Gimli humor, some very fascinating character development scenes, some new Sam and Frodo scenes which make the journey through Mordor much longer, more grim, and more interesting.  More MASSIVE digital army shots are cool.The special features are, as with all the E DVD's, extremely in-depth and interesting, discussing the movie-and-book-differences and why they were made that way, music, sound, digital effects, the miniatures, the different sets, the filming process, the weapons, armor, creature, and prosthetic making, the editing, and more.  Lastly, there is an entire  documentary with the actors and crew saying goodbye and talking about the last moments of the filming and their last scenes, etc.  Very nice.So there you have it..........choose wiselythis was a weird review"	5.0	fantastic	2005-01-02	4	2	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1VDRK69F22YMN	Anticlimacus	"I've seen this movie before, but remember almost nothing about it. I re-watched it and concluded that it had similar flaws to Two Towers, but here are some notes.SPOILERS!--The film opens with two tards named Smeagol and Deagol. No, I'm not making this up. Deagol finds the ring in the river, then Smeagol kills him for it. I can't help but laugh while writing this. This is hokey stuff.--Sarumon inexplicably has no power anymore. Well, that's convenient. I guess that powerful wizard wasn't all that powerful after all.--And speaking of wizards, Gandalf is completely misused. So the scriptwriters (and/or novelist) use a contrived twist to bring him back to life in Two Towers, only to then use him for basic swordsman tasks. Isn't this guy some kind of powerful wizard? Why the hell does he spend almost all of his time riding horses, leading armies, and beating orcs over the head with his staff? Last time I checked, wizards use magic and cast spells. Gandalf is portrayed as a three-trick pony in terms of magic. He can summon eagles, exorcise kings, and make his staff glow. That's about it. If this guy had any real skills, he'd use powerful magic spells during the battles. Apparently, Gandalf is better at using blunt objects. They should have let this guy die in peace during Fellowship.--This film has the same boring filler material that Two Towers had. Again I ask, what do the characters accomplish during the first two hours of this movie? The humans sit around and prepare for war, which consists of putting on armor and walking or riding around. No battle strategies are discussed whatsoever. Why can't someone write some interesting dialogue for a change? All we get is banal, middling chit chat about honor and the coming fight. It's incredibly tedious stuff.--Okay, let's take a look at Gollum. Many reviewers (even those who dislike the film) think that he's a well-written character. I disagree. It's rather ironic that his ""good guy"" personality completely disappears early on in the film, which contradicts his persona that was defined in Two Towers. He's just purely evil and manipulative in Return of the King. So I ask, what was the point in giving him a split personality in Two Towers? I'll tell you: it was a cheap gimmick and a lazy way to create a character with fake complexity. Also, at this point I'm frankly getting sick of hearing him say ""precious"" every other sentence. This guy must be one of the most annoying characters ever created.--Frodo, Sam, and Gollum continue to walk through mostly gray environments, but there is a bit more color in Return of the King when compared to Two Towers. You see, there's a white castle in this one. That's a big step forward for Jackson. Maybe next time he can add a third color to the film's color scheme.--Liv Tyler still can't act.--Some super villain called the Witch-king is introduced. Not surprisingly, he barely gets any screen time. He also dies rather easily for being the most powerful of his kind.--So Aragorn attempts to recruit a ghost army. You'd think that would be difficult, but he waves his special sword around and they immediately follow him. Can't we make this stuff a bit more interesting? Some kind of test, riddle, or obstacle would have made the scene more memorable.--There's no additional character development for any of the characters in this movie. Even the newer douchebag character named Denethor is wafer thin. There's a scriptwriting contrivance where his son is delivered half-dead but Denethor thinks he's completely dead, so he commits suicide. This despite the fact that he heartlessly sent his son on the suicide mission to begin with. It's kinda stupid, actually.--The big battle ensues at Minas Tirith. At first it feels impersonal because it involves a lot of stock characters that no one cares about. Also, it's like a rehash of the Helm's Deep battle where hope is almost lost until reinforcements arrive. However, it gets more engaging as it moves along and there are some cool moments, like the giant elephants. Overall, I think it's a good battle.--We get a memorable moment when Sam fights the giant spider. Definitely one of the best scenes in the film.--The final hour is both predictable and dull. This film takes forever to end. It's simply not worth slugging through 200 minutes for only a small handful of good moments.This film won 11 Academy awards. One can only shake their head in disbelief. At heart this is a brainless action movie with thin melodrama masquerading as dramatic depth. Of the numerous awards, Return of the King won for Best Film Editing, which is hilarious."	2.0	Slightly Better Than Two Towers, But That's Not Saying Much	2013-06-12	8	0	8
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A13H2JJ3GEMJN1	"AntiochAndy ""antiochandy"""	Two things. First, I'm just doing this one review to cover the entire trilogy, because it's all a single entity as far as I'm concerned. And I'm doing it for the extended versions because that's what I bought. I knew that's what I wanted and I just endured the extra wait until the extended version of each segment was released. Second, I'm endlessly amused by people who quibble that Jackson didn't remain faithful to the books, line for line. I mean, c'mon, they're translating from one medium to another. It's amazing that they did as well as they did. Did they take some liberties? Of course. Did some elements get left out? Of course, but what we got is remarkably true to the books. I applaud Peter Jackson and the rest of the people involved for bringing this tale to the screen. They did a magnificent job. I never expected to see these books done anywhere near this well.The movies, themselves? They're beautiful. The faithfulness, the attention to detail, the gorgeous scenery, the drama, the touches of humor (very much ala Tolkien), the sound, the special effects, the acting...  This movie deserved all the academy awards it got. In fact, they could have given each film the award for best picture in it's year and it would have suited me just fine.I recently sat down on a Saturday with my brothers and watched all three extended versions in sequence on a big screen TV (one brother has the whole set-up: big screen, surround sound, etc.). WOW! We started just after noon and ended around 2:30 the following morning. That includes brief breaks between discs and an hour for dinner between TTT and ROTK. It was a lot of movie and I'll not try something like that again soon, but it was a terrific experience. I had hobbits and other denizens of Middle Earth in my dreams for the next two or three nights, but I'm definitely not complaining.Not everyone will love these, of course. You can't please all of the people all the time (to re-work an old bit of wisdom), but the almost universal acclaim says a lot. This is classic literature brilliantly realized on the screen. I'm happy to own these DVDs (and I haven't ever viewed most of the extensive special features yet). If you're one of those who hasn't seen them yet...well, what are you waiting for? Don't just take my word for it, there are an overwhelming number of other 5-star reviews here. Go for it. The LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy gets my very highest recommendation (both books and movies).	5.0	Magnificent	2005-02-20	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2EL3990HXOMZB	Antonio Robert	"Two years ago, not considering the cult following J. R. R. Tolkien's work worth reading the books (although their literary and historical importance is undisputable), I nevertheless decided to give ""The Lord of the Rings"" film trilogy a try. The first two parts -- ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"" are and will remain examples of a very good film craft, but the climactic third part ""The Return of the King"" made it all worth checking out -- yes, I guess the nine hours spent in the cinema will not be in vain for most movie lovers.There's certainly not much left to be said about this film. It's one of those rare cases when the hype is actually justified. Although the story will never outgrow what it really is -- a never-to-be-real fantasy, what counts here is the sweeping imagination, powerful storytelling and dazzlingly spectacular special effects. I don't know whether the film stayed true to the book and, frankly, I really don't care. But what I do know is that the making of the LOTR trilogy was a labour of love for people around the director Peter Jackson and the result must have brought satisfaction also to the vast majority of those who have seen it. The actors also merit high praise. None of the stars stands out, but as a whole, the cast is probably the best possible.As for the awards; I did not think the ""Fellowship"" or the ""Towers"" deserved to win, let's say, an Oscar for the best picture. ""The Return of the King"" deserves it. In itself, it's a stunning cinematic achievement, and has helped make the trilogy one of the most momentous art-works the 21st century has to offer so far."	5.0	King Returns to Rule 'em All.. the Fantasy Films (4.5 stars)	2004-02-23	2	1	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A21EKBLNPXB2ZH	"Aprajita Veronica Booth ""Veronica000"""	There are many reviews about the extraordinary qualities of these three movies, with Return being the climactic high point in both a narrative sense and a cinematic sense as well.  I havent felt this attatched to characters in a long time and realize that this trilogy has raised the bar in so many ways.  My one fault (who cares if it doesnt follow the book completely-it got a million people reading the books!  Actually reading!)  is that there are some racial steriotypes hanging around...like the asians in their closely resembling junks and the orc hybrids looking extremely African American...I understand that there needs to be a basis for every character, but making all humans and elfs in the movie aryan was just a tad annoying.  Superficial, yes to a degree, but this is a movie that will live on, and I hope that that doesnt date it.  In any case a must see film.	5.0	Incredible. But Mildly Problematic	2004-01-19	16	3	13

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E	"Archie Mercer ""Archie"""	"As almost everyone knows, TROK is the best of the three movies. Gut-wrenching and suspenseful, even if you have read the books, it takes the viewer on a trip beyond imagination. It is a classic book filmed almost perfectly by Peter Jackson and company.The extended version does have some issues though. A lot of the new and extended scenes on disk 1 seem to for the first time have a ""filler"" feel to them. The ""Voice of Saruman"" scene is the first of the new scenes and is needed. Although it is not accurate to the books version of the end of Saruman (there is NO way the correct way could have been done without adding another 30 to 45 minutes to the end of the film) it is adequate. The absense of Saruman in the theatrical release version was always a problem to me. But other new scenes, like ""Eowyn's Dream"" really do not seem to have the purpose of expanding the story. Another new scene, ""Sam's Warning"" where Sam threatens Gollum (for probably the 5th time) just supports the already known fact that Sam does not trust Gollum. But the expanded scene, ""The Paths of the Dead"" was a wonderful addition, well worth the watch.Disk 2 made up for any issue I had with disk 1. The first scene is brand new and shows how Aragorn captures the Corsair's ships. ""Merry's Simple Courage"" is a nice, touching new scene. And the MUCH expanded battle scenes of ""The Battle of the Pelennor Fields"" & ""Victory at Minas Tirith"" are absolutely brilliant.One of the best part of this version is the expanded roles of Merry & Pippen. In the books both characters were heros in their own right. In the theatrical version you only se a little of that. In the Extended releases you get to see many more heroic deeds from these two.The Lords of the Rings series has been a joy to watch for the past three years. As the books were favorites of mine since I first read them back in the 70's I had been worried about how this would play out on the screen. I shouldn't have been.

As the coda of the Trilogy, I had high hopes for the extended version. Alas, alas. The extra time that could have been used to relate threads of the complex story and tie up loose ends has been wasted. The added scenes are, for the most part, all non-canonical. (I.e., not in the book). The most important loose end, the Three Rings, is left almost as afterthought and even then it wasn't gotten right. It was an essential plot point and it was cheerfully tossed overboard in favor of creating non-events. Unless you crave the endless extra features and frat-boy prank Easter eggs, save your money and buy the plain-jane DVD version of this movie.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2VMT89TCSF105	"Ashtar Command ""Seeker"""	"""The return of the king"" is the third Peter Jackson movie based on Tolkien's fantasy epic ""Lord of the Rings"" (LOTR).I liked the two other movies, but by the time the third was released, I had become ""bored of the rings"", to use a phrase known to detractors of Tolkien and the LOTR universe. I got the same feeling when reading the novels. The second and the third novel are pretty much the same story, repeated twice! I know that's not *strictly* speaking true, but that's how I mentally felt like after digesting them.In the same way, ""The return of the king"" feels like ""The Two Towers"" plus even more special effects, battles, monsters, and what not. I was excited by the effects in the first two movies, but started suffering from ""special effect tedium"" when watching the battle between the good guys and the Witch-king of Angmar outside Gondor. As usual, Gollum saves the day, but he isn't the centrepiece of attention as he was in ""The Two Towers"". And why is it so bloody important that Aragorn should become king of Gondor, anyway? I never got that part...On one point, the movie version is actually worse than Tolkien's original epic. It leaves out the scourging of the Shire, which I take to be an important part of the plot. The scourging makes Frodo's decision to leave even more understandable, explains the ultimate fate of Saruman (the most visible villain in the story - Sauron never manages to rematerialize), and shows Tolkien's ecological concerns. Jackson apparently felt that the LOTR films were getting out of hand already, and decided to skip it (it's not included on the extended version either, although the fans hoped that it would be). Christopher Lee, who stars Saruman, was apparently so disappointed that he didn't even show up at the official premiere!Only three stars for you this time, Mr. Jackson."	3.0	Bored by the king	2010-04-20	17	0	17
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3R1LT8XJHBV00	A. Stryker	This film was FANTASTIC.  It's very hard for me to put across in words how wonderful this movie truly is.  A must-see for ALL Lord of the Rings fans, HOWEVER, don't go see this film if you haven't seen the 1st two!Everything about this movie is great.  The acting, the score, the special effects, costumes, the sets...everything!!  I thought that all the actors did a brilliant job in this one, especially Sean Astin (who SHOULD have gotten an Oscar nod -- although, I KNOW it's an 'ensemble' thing), Andy Serkis' Gollum was superb (again), I was intrigued by the Denethor/Faramir relationship and I had hoped they would have expanded on this (having read the book and Faramir being my favourite character), but John Noble's Denethor to David Wenham's Faramir...excellent.  You can really feel the tension in that relationship.  They were all brilliant, what can I say?I loved the special effects, too.  The Battle of Pelennor was, or has to be, the BIGGEST on screen battle in cinematic history.  Yet, while the battle raged on, you still had the little stories thrown in, Eowyn/Merry fighting the Witch King to save Theoden, Pippin & Gandalf trying to save Faramir's life (with Gandalf trying to save Minas Tirith from crumbling at the same time).  And then Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli doing their thing...(which there should have been MORE of their story in here).  The ending with the destruction of Sauron...I would pay $8.50 just to see this part of the movie ALONE.  It's FANTASTIC.  Easily one of my favourite parts (obviously).I cried so many times during this film, and each time I see it I find a new place to cry, honestly.  It's filled with such heart and emotion.This film, in case you haven't heard, was nominated for 11 Oscars and SHOULD win them ALL.  If they don't, I'm revolting.  haha...What it finally comes down to is that you SHOULD see this movie...NOW.	5.0	One film to rule them all...	2004-02-02	4	3	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3568NFZQJL313	A. Tomsho	I know a lot of purists are upset over the changes made with the transition from prose to screen, but I personally loved this movie! One of the best compliments I can give it is that in over three hours of cinema, not once is there a single spot slow enough for you to get up and go to the bathroom.I was a little disappointed with the way Faramir was portrayed in the The Two Towers, though the estended version of the DVD cleared some of that up for me. The character really got his chance to shine in this movie, though.Ian McKellen was Gandalf. He had so fully immersed himself in the role that it's hard to believe he could act differently in real life. He came across so convincing.I would also like to give a huge round of applause to Sean Astin. I had always thought you had to be a Lord of the Rings geek to truly appreciate what a pivotal and important character Samwise was. Mr. Astin really was able to bring that out in his performance. Return of the King shows him at his best. Even the youngest viewers can understand just how significant Sam was to the story. This character goes underappreciated by a lot of people, so it's good to see him portrayed so accurately.And of course there's Gollum. Tolkien made it a point throughout his books to state that one of the reasons Gollum had survived so many encounters was because people pitied him. In these movies, you really connected with Gollum as a character. He was given the depth and attention he deserves. Some people complained that Gollum can't be cute, but then how are we supposed to pity him?To those who would say that Return of the King is nothing but special effects, let me re-state what we already know: the casting was perfect, the acting was nothing short of superb, the cinematography was spectacular, the music was beautifully arranged, and the imagery was so deep and well-thought out that it really made the lands of Middle Earth seem to come alive. Rather than focusing on the special effects, Jackson focused on the story that made those special effects a necessity.I await the extended DVD for a number of reasons. First of all is because I've heard that closure is given to the fate of Saruman, and that is pretty important to me.Now all that's left to do is wait for this movie to sweep the Oscars. If the academy does not give this film the credit it deserves, it only proves that they are completely immersed in pretense and self-importance. Who cares if a movie isn't art? If it entertains, then in my book that's good enough.	5.0	My new favorite movie!	2004-01-06	3	3	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1CQGAPQMN41LV	"A. Whitehead ""Werthead"""	The Return of the King concludes the Lord of the Rings film trilogy. On release it was one of the most-lauded movies of all time, receiving eleven Oscars which tied it with Ben-Hur and Titanic for the record, and becoming the second-highest grossing movie in history. However, critical reappraisals of the film over the past decade have been more mixed.On the positive side, much of the craftsmanship, attention to detail and acting skills of the first two movies have carried over into this one. The actors all do good work (even if Viggo Mortensen as 'King' Aragorn is distinctly less convincing than his depiction of Strider the Ranger) and are bolstered by the addition of John 'Walter Bishop from Fringe' Noble as Denethor. Denethor isn't very well-written, but Noble gives his heart and soul in the role and manages to sell it, inconsistencies, unconvincing-flaming-death-plunges, warts and all. The effects are impressive, with the miniature work on Minas Tirith and its combination with CGI and physical sets being breathtaking. The CGI for Gollum has been upgraded as well, improving upon the already near-flawless work on the second film. There's some genuine power to iconic scenes from the book as they are realised in the film: the Ride of the Rohirrim is amazing, the battle with Shelob (which could have looked very silly) is extremely well-done, the lighting of the beacons is inspiring and Sean Astin's work as Sam on the slopes of Mount Doom is highly impressive. The decision to cast Andy Serkis as the pre-Ring Gollum is also inspired, and the resulting prequel sequence for the movie is tremendously effective.But, for all of its high points, the film suffers in several areas. The most notable is pacing. The three-and-a-half hour cinematic cut is simply too long, with too many climaxes. The novel averts this problem by inserting the thematically vital Scouring of the Shire sequence into the midst of the ending, giving the Hobbits a crisis they need to overcome by themselves before matters are fully resolved. The absence of the Scouring, though understandable for time and budgetary reasons, weakens the ending of the story on screen and makes the final sequence of goodbyes and farewells somewhat interminable. Something that should have definitely been cut is the 'dying Arwen' storyline, which is utterly nonsensical, doesn't make any sense and leeches the life out of the film whenever it appears. Whilst it was nice of the film-makers to try to involve Arwen more in the storyline, it is so badly-handled they really shouldn't have bothered. This also leads to the bizarre scene in which Elrond teleports to Rohan (making something of a mockery of the extremely tough journey everyone has endured, if he can just replicate it in a few days with ease) and gives Aragorn his sword, which he could have just done before they left Rivendell as in the book. These problems can be boiled down to the producers not trusting Tolkien and the book and instead inserting lots more fake drama and jeopardy into the storyline in an unnecessary attempt to spice things up when things are tense enough and the stakes high enough already.Another problem is an overreliance on CGI and effects. The Return of the King features a startling three times as many effects shots as The Fellowship of the Ring and this leads to, at times, the film starting to slide into the Star Wars prequel trilogy problem of things looking too fake and unconvincing. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields is visually impressive and it would be difficult to do it without CGI, but there's too many shots where it's obvious the actors are waving swords in front of greenscreens. This fakery lets down the battle a little, and renders it less impressive overall than the much more tightly-orchestrated Battle of Helm's Deep from the previous film. There's also the decision to use the Army of the Dead to save the day at the Pelennor Fields, which is a cheap and easy way of resolving the situation but also a nonsensical one: in the book the Army can be used once and once only, and vanishes after Aragorn uses it to seize the fleet at Pelargir. In the film it can be used until Aragorn says so, and it's hard to argue with Gimli's suggestion they carry on using it until Sauron is defeated (what's a few more days to an army that's been cursed for a thousand years?). The dumbing-down from the book in an apparent attempt to avoid having to cast Prince Imrahil and use Gondor's actual army is bizarre, as that would not have been particularly time-consuming anyway.Ultimately, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (***) does not have so many problems that those who loved the first two films will hate this one and some of those problems (the increased use of portentous and pretentious dialogue, for example) are taken straight from the book. But The Return of the King remains the weakest link in the trilogy, where self-indulgence - particularly with regards to length, spectacle and effects - are allowed on a few too many occasions to override the storytelling and characters.Note on the Extended Edition: As with its predecessors, The Return of the King was re-released a year after its original release with new material added. In this case there is about 45 minutes of new scenes. Some of these scenes are actually very good, with the final confrontation with Saruman being something that should never have been cut out in the first place. However, too many scenes go over information we already know, add little to the narrative and in a few cases are excruciatingly awful. The scene where Aragorn seizes the pirate ships is badly-acted, badly-written and appallingly self-indulgent (the crew of the pirate ship is made up of behind-the-scenes crewmembers). Even Jackson on the commentary admits it isn't every good, which makes it a bit odd that they put it back. The less also said about the 'billion skull rockslide', the better. The biggest problem is that, Saruman scene aside, the Extended Edition does not add anything essential to the film and drags its already overlong run time to well over the four hour mark. Accordingly, the Extended Edition (***) is in this case not the definitive version and should only be watched if you are a completionist.	4.0	Moments of brilliance but let down by poor pacing and bad writing decisions	2013-09-12	2	2	0

Expectations are so high, and by now the amazement of the CGI of Gollum or the incredible cinimatography has worn off, and the fact that there must be an ending, not a cliffhanger, all conspire against the closing chapter from a ""this is great, I need to see the next one"", to ""its over, nothing more to see"". We've see it in Star Wars and the Matrix, the failure of the closing chapter to set one imagination on fire, and to some degree I think it can be said the same for Return of the King. But in comparison to SW or MR, we see a closing chapter that continues the quality of the first two installments, and although the wow factor diminishes, the quality does not."	4.0	The Last Film of a Trilogy...	2004-12-08	9	5	4

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AVYMBTCXYREXE	"Batmanbrb ""batmansbrb"""	This movie was probably the hardest of the three films to make because there was such a wealth of storyline and trying to cram it all in 3 1/2 hours really left the movie feeling like something was missing.  Thank goodness the Extended DVD will totally satisfy all us fans.  However, even though I like 'all the endings' after seeing it over 5 times, I would rather have seen those cut out for the theatrical release and stick in the fight between Gandalf and Saruman as well as the Witch King confronting Gandalf and breaking his staff (which will be included in the Extended Version).Anyway, I have to be honest, even though I enjoyed the movie the first time, I was a little disappointed in it because my expections were so high.  However, now that I have watched it over 5 times, I totally understand now why it swept the Oscars and I now love this movie very much, but it's still my least favorite of the three.  I can probably speculate that the extended version will raise my opinion of this movie considerably (as the other two films extended editions did).I won't bother to recount the story because there are hundreds of descriptions already posted here.  This movie was epic and grand, special effects were decent - but they did not overshadow the story (Hint! Hint! to George Lucas).  My most favorite moments were Gandalf's ride to Minas Tirith, Lighting of the Beacons, the &quot;Oscar Moment&quot; of Faramir riding to his death as Pippin sings an incredible ditty to Denethor as he ravages cherry tomatoes like some starved beast.  The beginning scenes of Frodo entering Shelob's lair was very well filmed, the comedy between Gandalf and Pippin was refreshing, the Witch-King's defeat by Merry and Eowyn was very good, the 'bull-dozer' charge of the Rohirim was phenominal.  The Nazgul on the fell beasts grabbing men and throwing them to their death was horrifying.  I guess I could go on, but those are my favorite moments.  My main complaint was that the &quot;King&quot; and his friends Legolas and Gimli were very robbed of scenes.  I know there are extended scenes of these 3 in the mountain caves of the dead, and I've heard that Aragorn will confront the Mouth of Sauron at the Black Gates in the EE.So, basically, Yes, this is a very good movie, but more so than the other two films, I think this one has to be watched several times to really appreciate its greatness.  I've read some very ridiculous criticisms of this movie here, like &quot;LOTR is a rip-off of &quot;Star Wars&quot;... haha... HELLO!!!  LOTR was written over 40 years ago - if anything was ripped off, it was Star Wars ripping off LOTR!!

Cochonour ""Rolstin"""	I thoroughly enjoyed all three in the series and I own all three extended versions.  ROtK's ext version, like the previous two, includes fantastic footage.  It gives me new respect for Peter Jackson and his difficult decisons.Many extended movies and director's cuts contain scenes that are absolute crap and deserve to be omitted.  These three are special because extra scenes improve the quality & continuity of the film.If I could order a dream version of these films, though, I think I would remove all the scenes with Frodo & Sam from the second and third movies.  You need those scenes for the plot, and they were admirably acted, but I will use the mighty Skip button on them on future viewings.  This is not anyone's fault - in reading the books, I was always ready to get away from Frodo & Sam.All in all, though, this was a landmark trilogy.  In movie-dome, it strikes me as StarWars 2000.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3ACS6V536APSV	"BDSinC ""Music lover"""	"So much of what is good with this movie, and what some felt was wrong with it, has already been said. I won't comment much on that. I know that some people were outraged we didn't have the scourging of the Shire, which is in the novel. I missed it too, but have to say, it would have been such a ""let down"" theatrically. Imagine, we have just had our guts wrenched out of us, nearly fearing the loss of all hope as Frodo puts on the ring, and finally the battle is won, evil has been vanquished. Even in the book, after all the heavy stuff of war before it, the scourging of the Shire seemed, well, just too much of a ""good thing"" when all the real battle was over, and the threat to middle-earth destroyed. We know that Saruman had no power anymore, and he would be defeated. The fact he went and enslaved some Hobbits to appease his ego was completely out of place, and it made the very long summing up of a great story too long. Destroying Saruman as he was destroyed and where he was destroyed made perfect theatrical sense. His power was over, his threat destroyed. That last little bit in the Shire, as in the book, would not have changed a thing in regards to him. However, it would have made a huge difference in regards to the movie. Like I said, we have been wrenched in two, emotionally, as the various characters face their nearly overwhelming battles that are at times almost hopeless and unwinnable. We have seen Frodo fail, really, and be overcome by the power of the ring (it is really Gollum's greed for ""the Precious"" that finally destroys the ring, Frodo has given in and if Gollum had not bitten off his finger and fallen over the edge and died with the ring, Sauran would have won, and middle earth would have been destroyed). And finally, because of all things combined, we see the destruction of evil and victory for middle earth. The real important battle, the cause of the entire story to begin with has actually ended. The rest of the movie and the book is a summing up of things. I was actually disappointed when I read the book as a kid to see we had another battle to win to free the Shire; wasn't evil conquered once and for all, and now we have two caricatures holding on to their evil with no power whatever to sustain them tormenting the shire and we have to overpower them all over again. The events pass quickly in the book and are forgotten. However, the destruction of Frodo as a person, a person unlike Sam who is able to reintegrate himself into his former world, is most telling and sad. Here we see a man who after all he finally overcame, even when in the end it was almost impossible for him to overcome what he did, couldn't find the strength within to face life and go on. The movie portrays that somewhat (though by no means as it is portrayed in the book; in the book, the Hobbits in the Shire sing the praises of Sam and the others as true heros, while to them Frodo becomes too distant, too depressing to be understood, and even though he had the greatest of the great deeds to accomplish, the hardest of all tests and challenges to overcome, no one seems to even see much importance in him at all; also, he cannot relate to his former life, his former hobbit values, you could say, he has been forever changed, and life as it was can never be his again -- a common result of war for many soldiers). We have seen Frodo changing throughout the entire trilogy and the ring possessing him. It really wins, after all, even if it is destroyed, for the damage it does, the evil with which it infects all those who possess it also infected Frodo, and he is never freed from that. To me, it was far more important to express these feelings, for we saw them before our eyes, and resolve them, than to once again have us see another battle (and in the extended version, we are witness to many, many battles, an additional one would not enhance our experience much). As we see, as in the book, the only resolution for Frodo is to leave middle earth and the Shire. He leaves with Bilbo and with all those who are not of men. Sam returns, though very sad, to the Shire and to his new and wonderfully fulfilling life. The quest didn't destroy him, even if his brief moment carrying the ring had its affects. Frodo, on the other hand was changed completely.The wonderful thing about the books is they reflect on so many different issues while telling a very long involved and moving story. It is more than a kid's ""war-time fairytale"" even if the author considered it nothing more than a child's book. The Hobbit is such a work, Lord of the Rings is not. Through the entire movie series, Jackson has thrown us deep into the horrors, the fears, the despair, and the triumphs of the characters. Once we have sighed with them the sighs of relief for all is now safe and the evil is destroyed, to force us to endure another battle (and one as unthreatening as the scourging of the Shire really is) would destroy the feelings and the emotional release we so deeply need.So many have commented on the fact that the ending after the end of the wars seemed just ""slow"" and unnecessary. If that is what you feel, then I can guarantee you after watching the incredible victory that is achieved, to see the Scourging of the Shire would have been even more of a let down, for it would make no sense at all; why another battle when the war was won.There are many parts of the movie that are not faithful to the details of the book, but the feel of the book is well represented. Some have complained that it would have been impossible for the Witch King to destroy Gandolf's staff, and in the explanations they give that is quite true, but it is there to let us know just how powerful the evil has become. It is not Gandolf's staff that is the source of his power anyway, and besides, from that point on (even in the book) we see no evidence of his great ""wizardry"" anyway. However, it is so necessary that we the viewer understand just how powerful Sauran has become. His evil has invaded the entire world, and excepting a few who battle against him, most all the world is rushing to his support. The scene could have been done better, that is true, and there could have been more clarity in explaining what was happening, but in the end, we get the message: evil is stronger now than ever, and the battle against it will be impossible to win if Frodo should fail, not even the power of the most powerful wizard of all could save middle-earth. It was important that this message, and the feelings of hopeless despair it would bring be set in our minds so that we are in despair as we watch the battle that would come and fear, as our lead characters fear, wondering if Frodo will be successful (and there are moments that it is most powerfully presented in the movie that one can tell the characters actually get a sense all is lost, the battle is over and middle earth will be no more; then we notice the eye change its focus, and all switches raising our expectations and our hopes).I agree that the house of healing was not well represented, and the reason the various characters were there is not made clear. However, the fact we even have what we have in such a long movie is wonderful. At least we now know how various people meet, and that Arogorn is not only a wonderful Ranger, Friend, part of the Fellowship, but a real King who is there for the serving of his people. Even getting that tiny bit is well worth it.Overall, I loved this movie, as I have done all the extended versions (I never watch the theatrical releases anymore, as once I saw the extended versions I simply didn't enjoy them). I think this is an unbelievable movie accomplishment, one that we are not likely to see again in the future or for a very long time. And as for a movie version of the Hobbit, well, why bother. So many things in the Hobbit (which is where the story of the ring and the hobbits begins) are changed so drastically by the time of Lord of the Rings, the contradictions would leave us wanting or disappointed. Should anyone want another Tolken book to make a movie of, the Simarillion would be a far better choice.I recommend this movie to everyone. It is long, but very satisfying. It is a super ending to a most difficult and ""impossible to adapt"" book, and I am sure the best we will ever have, for as it stands, it is the best version that has ever been presented ever."	5.0	extraordinary and Fabulous	2004-12-18	10	6	4

The entire Lord of The Rings series and their predecessor,""The Hobbit "" are a must read for every child in your household. If you haven't read them yet..then treat yourself to a wonderful adventure. I didn't discover these masterpieces untill I was in my 30's. I read them outloud to my kids and we still watch the DVD's together. They have now introduced them to their own children.  This special boxed set is so beautiful. The strange way in which I was led to these wonderful books and the stories of Middle Earth , was that I saw a guy wearing a tee shirt that said ""Frodo Lives"". I asked what it meant and the rest is history. I guess alot of kids in college were wearing these tee shirts in the 70's."	5.0	What you read defines who you are.	2012-08-19	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2YHVU7K4DM1SH	Benjamin Ho	few words can be used to describe the final installation of Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings. While the theatrical version highlighted the key elements of the story, the extended one goes further by exploring some of the more poignant moments in the saga. For example, I loved the extended scenes of Eowyn and her relationship with both Aragorn and Faramir. In the extended cut, one also appreciates the return of Aragorn to the throne of Gondor, as the movie increasingly demonstrates the strength, courage and ultimately, the nobility of the the ranger-turned-King. The 4 hour 10 minute screening was picture perfect - though it would have been better if the last few movie chapters contained extended scenes in them (considering the critics about the multiple endings) - in my opinion, this is the best of the lot!	5.0	An absolute beauty	2004-12-10	11	9	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A31I3HXMD5H1EL	Benjamin J Burgraff	"I admit that I've been a GREAT fan of the Tolkien trilogy since I first read them (in the 1960's), and that I love director Peter Jackson's visionary interpretation, but I'm not going to attempt to analyze the longer (and superior) version of ""The Return of the King"", here...what truly makes the Extended Edition absolutely ESSENTIAL for ANY film fan are the 2 discs of additional features!If you really love filmmaking, in all of it's many aspects, you will NEVER find a more comprehensive 'primer' of the creation of a film classic! Beginning with the WWI experiences of J.R.R. Tolkien, which, combined with his love of the heroic prose epics of Great Britain and Scandinavia, and an amazing talent to create languages, led to his writing what he considered an ""unfilmable"" classic trilogy, the viewer is taken on a journey as magical and fascinating as the final chapter, itself.Jumping from Tolkien's source material to Peter Jackson's daunting task of not only completing the trilogy, but making the final part the greatest of the three films, we visit each area of production, with step-by-step documentary 'chapters' of how the finished film was achieved. While a 'nuts and bolts' technical overview has been done as an 'additional feature' for many DVDs, I've never seen a version more comprehensive and entertaining, because Jackson produced it, himself, and set the chapters into a timeline (from pre-production to premiere), that captures the tension and excitement of a film so large in scope and production that the final FX shots and music were not inserted until less than a week before ""Return"" premiered, world-wide!Fascinating stories and secrets are shared, by cast and crew...You finally meet one of the 'little people' who played a Hobbit for the long shots of the trilogy; Christopher Lee's controversial 'disappearance' from the final theatrical cut is explained; you get to see 'unused' subplots that were actually filmed (including a thankfully discarded sword battle finale between Aragorn and Sauron); in a very funny sequence, you see Jackson and many production heads, in full make-up, doing 'cameos' as Corsair pirates during a battle!There is much, much, more, and every chapter, from FX to Costume, from Sound Design to Music, are each given loving attention, and are all terrific, and great fun.As a climax, viewers are treated to the premieres in Wellington, and around the world, and get front-row seats for both the Oscars and the post-Oscar party...then get to see Jackson return to the studio to add even MORE footage to the 'Best Picture' winner, for this extended edition!See why I consider this version ESSENTIAL? To my knowledge, there has never been so much fabulous material offered in ANY 'Special Edition' DVD!This IS a 'MUST' for ANY film fan's collection!"	5.0	Extended Edition a MUST for Film Fans!	2004-12-19	7	7	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1GJO22X6ODPGS	Ben Lacy	First off, too many people are complaining about the adaptation of the book to the big screen.  What I say to these self-righteous folks is: it 's an adaptation, Peter Jackson preserved every ounce of integrity tackling this hugh project, and sure, a few characters were left out, I've read the books several times too, but you can't perfectly reproduce a set of books like this to the big screen.  It just doesn't happen.  What Peter Jackson did do, was adapt the greatest fantasy story to the big screen very accurately, and I think Tolkien would be proud.I have nothing against purists, but come on, be realistic.  These movies were not made for YOU personally, P. Jackson made these films for the masses, while trying not to compromise anything he didn't have to for the sake of time, money, etc.  Even Tolkien historians who had apprehensions about the films before production are agreeing that Peter Jackson did an excellent job of reproducing these stories on the big screen.Having said that, the movie is amazing in its scope, power, sense of connection with the characters, and amazing Computer Graphics.  Also, just look at the detail that went into making every single costume and piece of clothing, armor, weapons, jewelry, etc.  It's just awe-inspiring.  Just watch the extras to see exactly how much went into the making of this film.  This really is my new favorite movie ever.	5.0	Probably my favorite movie.  EVER.	2004-12-06	5	4	1

Also Sam does not get the opportunity to try out his ring skills.Mean while back at the ranch. Oops Minas Tirith prepares for a major battle. Aragorn sees dead people. We see a flaming Denethor (John Noble). If they survive the battle then they must prepare to confront Sauron of Mordor to distract him from his real threat (Frodo).The absents of the scouring of the Shire we still get the feel if not an added extra as the four Hobbits having been places and seeing sights that are unfathomable to the other residents of the Shire look knowingly at each other.Comments on the four hours and ten minute version suggests that the is quite a bit more footage that is not seen here and may never be.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AS6L0L7D0EZOK	"Bert Caruthers ""Hage"""	"As with so many other Tolkein fans out there, I've been anxiously awaiting this release and was finally treated to it after receiving it as a holiday gift.  By way of background, when I initially saw Return of the King in the movie theater (2 or 3 times), I thoroughly enjoyed it but was somewhat disappointed.  Generally, I felt that the filmmakers made certain decisions as to content (i.e., what to include and what not to include) that I would not have made.  Of course, the thing to realize is that the films are derivative of the original books and given the volume of material included in Tolkein's masterwork, it is impossible to include everything in the films.  Nonetheless, I could tell that there were several scenes in the theatrical version which would be expanded in the Platinum Series.While the extended edition of Return of the King does not include ""everything I would liked to have seen,"" it adds so much flavor to an already brilliant film.  For anyone who loves Tolkein or anyone who never read Tolkein but loved the movies, this (and each of the extended editions) are must-haves.  My favorite added/extended scenes are:  (i) the additional details concerning the many battle scenes; (ii) the Mouth of Sauron scene; and, (iii) the scenes w/ Frodo and Sam in Cirith Ungol and Mordor. I was somewhat disappointed with the scene in which ""Aragorn Masters the Palantir"" (started out well but the ending was not in keeping with the character of soon-to-be King Elessar).  Likewise, ""the Voice of Saruman"" scene fails to included Gandalf's warning re: the pursuasiveness of the wizard's voice).  The ""Hour of the Witch King"" also left something to be desired although I loved the courage and bravery of Shadowfax).  Also, it would have been very useful to the plot had the filmmakers included a scene with Denethor using the Palantir of Minas Tirith -- it would give newcomers to Tolkein a better understanding of what drove the Steward to madness.  Finally, it would also have been fun to see a scene at Cirith Ungol where Sam breaks the ""Will of the Watchers.""I know I'm a harsh critic because I love the books so much but, all in all, this was a wonderful adaptation.

Oh well...no matter, really, it's a joy to have the additonal material; a joy to see some of the other possiblities for certain scenes...and a few of the new scenes are truly worthwhile  (my personal favorite is the chance to see Christopher Lee and Brad Dourif one more time in ""The Voice of Sauroman"" which is a scene very faithful to the spirit of Sauroman's death in the book).  The wonderful thing is, you'll always have the choice between the EE and the Theatrical version.So...Buy it, watch it, and decided which version is YOUR ROTK.  You'll have fun deciding.

While Jackson may have taken some liberties, I am not such a purist to believe that one must stick to the book like glue in the use of elements in a story. Canon is the blueprint, the basic design, a guideline, yet Jackson took only a few liberties that enhanced the story without stepping out of bounds. Yes, there were &#34;many endings&#34; but there were also many lines to tie together before Sam finally got home. And I thought it not too out of bounds for Frodo to fight with Gollum over the Ring, since it had taken possession of him at the very end. i did miss the rooster crowing in the dawn when Gandalf and the Witch King met at the Gate, but the horns made up for that. Shelob was every bit the nightmare that she was in the book, making me jump out of my skin when I first saw her, and she still makes me shudder every time I see her in the picture.

The one-two punch delivered by Return of the King through inspired acting, and the incredible CGI effects, is simply amazing.

Some reviewers, and other viewers of the film have taken issue with the long ending(s), but I believe the manner in which the film comes to it's conclusion is very appropriate and ties up all loose ends.

Know how sadly dissapointed you may be.  I was able to watch a rip of the extended version and I'm glad I did before I ordered it!  Unlike the first two where the extended version added some much needed scenes to fill gaps in the story, this version adds things that never even happened.  In a degree that was shocking and upsetting to me even thought I would not consider my self a Tolkein Purist.  I would have rather not had an extended version and I am sorry but the Scouring of the Shire was a damn important part!  I was okay with it not being in there but instead we get some made up crap, that never happened to Sauraman.  I will be ordering the theatrical release of this movie, at least it is not as far from the book as this version.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AHCVWPLA1O4X8	bixodoido	For the most part, the essence (if not the minor details) of Tolkien's great tale remains intact throughout the final movie in Peter Jackson's trilogy, The Lord of the Rings.  In fact, this film seems to recapture, mostly, the brilliance of the first movie, The Fellowship of the Ring.  The seamlessly flowing story and compelling characters, which were what made the first movie so great, and the lack of which made the second movie mediocre at best, are back in this final installment. This film features a vast array of important characters, too numerous to mention, and yet somehow manages to maintain the dignity of the story without becoming bogged down in the several simultaneous plotlines.  There is a lot going on at once in this movie, and many threads of story, but somehow it all comes together seamlessly at the end.As always, the acting is very well done, with spectacular performances by the entire cast, who seem to truly believe in what they are acting.  The special effects are also very good, as are the battle sequences and overall cinematography.  It is unfortunate that so many great elements of the book were not included in this film, but this is to be expected when, at nearly 3 1/2 hours, the movie is so action-packed that little else could be cut.  Still, I hated to see Saruman ignored in this film--I think this detracted a little from the overall effect.  Despite the discrepancies, however, this film is an exciting and climactic conclusion to an epic trilogy, a movie that will put you on the edge of your seat and leave you with a satisfying sense of completion when it's all said and done.	5.0	A great finale of an epic trilogy	2003-12-18	3	2	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A18QA3A3UYWFU9	Blade	"The final chapter of the wonderful J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy is finally here in its full, UNCUT version, which is indeed quite better than the theatrical cut and deserves much more credit than what it's given. This is the DVD release we've all been waiting for and the Special Features, BTS footage, & the other surprises packed in this special edition show no sign of slowing down and doesn't fail to hold the eye (No, I don't mean Sauron) of ANY Tolkien fan! (especially those who've read the books, you'll find these movies VERY close to what they were meant to be)Mr. Jackson is without a doubt, one of the most highy anticipated directors of all time since George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, and is truly the master of storytelling through his own vision of Middle Earth and the many different species that inhabit it ranging from hobbits, elves, dwarves, wizards, orcs, dragons, and so much more! It is all here in the beauty of each land (even the grotesque atmosphere of Mordor has plenty of detail with it's volcanoes) that draws us into the books, holds our interest, & never lets us go as if this could have actually been a real world in another lifetime! Of course, there is plenty of CG to go around, but it is very convincing even more so than that of the newest Star Wars films (though those are also excellent movies too!)Now that the LOTR trilogy is at long last complete in its entirety, we can always return to the familiar world of Middle Earth and relive all the exciting moments, from the journey of the Fellowship through the dangerous mines of Moria, the epic battle for Helm's Deep, & the final revelation of the two Hobbits, Frodo & Sam, as they venture up to the blazing inferno of Mt. Doom to destroy the one ring once and for all! Beautiful music, stunning special effects (CG or not), & the unforgettable characters with the PERFECT character development than any other movie ever seen in the face of history! The clever camera angles, some comic relief, & a ton of blood and gore also reminds me of some of Jackson's earlier works (Who hasn't seen ""Dead Alive"" or ""Bad Taste?"") which was good to use once more to his full advantage! (Heck, I'm surprised these merited a PG-13 rating!)As with the previous two films in their Extended Editions, you will get even more than ever before and these are definately the ones to own over the plain, two disk releases! Why? Well, most noticeable are the extended/deleted scenes that were NOT shown in the theatrical cuts, which REALLY help fill in some of gaps and connects well to the other scenes that were originally there. From my own perspective, ""Return of the King"" has the BEST never-before-seen footage that brings this awesome trilogy to a close better than ever before! Allow me to explain some of these scenes:(WARNING: Do NOT read this if you have not yet seen the movie. Contains spoilers...)One of these scenes shows the final confrontation between Sarumon (played magnificently in all three films by Christopher Lee) and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (a humorous and lively performance by John Rhys-Davies), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), & Mary & Pippin (played by Dominic Monaghan & Billy Boyd), who witness the evil white wizard fall from the Tower of Isenguard and to his death after being stabbed in the back by his assistant, Grima Wormtongue! (Originally meant to be used at the end of ""The Two Towers"") I've got to admit when I first saw 'Return' in theatres, I was quite disappointed at the beginning where they hadn't shown any more of Sarumon and what became of him. (And I think most fans would agree with me on this one too!) As a matter of fact, it is said that even Christopher Lee complained that his character did not get enough screen time. (From what I've heard from some reliable sources) I'm VERY glad that they added this scene in and therefore it was stupid of them to leave it out in the first place! *****-5 star ratingThe next extended scene is at the House of Healing, where Aragorn nurses Eowyn back to health and Faramir begins to fall for her. Although this scene wasn't really all that necessary in my opinion, I thought it fit in just fine and shows more character development, after all. ***-3 star ratingAnother scene showed Frodo and Sam being mistaken for orcs after disguising themselves in orc armor in the land of Mordor. I thought that this scene was needed because it actually showsexactly HOW Frodo and Sam sneak past the army of orcs in order to make their way to Mt. Doom. In addition, it gives the audience more of an up close and personal interaction with the orcs themselves! ****-4 star rating(END OF SPOILERS)Anyways, there are possibly a few more parts which were left out in the original version, but I'm not going to be explaining those. You'll just have to watch this version of the movie for yourself! Be prepared though, for this is obviously the LONGEST chapter and you may want to pop a little popcorn, grab some beers (Or soda, whichever you prefer) and brace yourself for this epic masterpiece of all time, running over FOUR HOURS! I have the original 'Fellowship' & 'Two Towers' on DVD, & I am very happy to finally own all three movies in their Extended Editions the way they were meant to be seen!! Please, do NOT pass these movies by, for everyone should view them all at least once!""ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL, ONE RING TO FIND THEM, ONE RING TO BRING THEM ALL AND IN THE DARKNESS BIND THEM..."""	5.0	RETURN OF THE KING-PLATINUM SERIES SPECIAL EXTENDED EDITION	2005-02-19	6	6	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	`The Return of the King' is the third movie of the three-volume novel, `Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien. This fiction is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as `Ben-Hur' and `Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, `Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's `Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's `Gone With the Wind'. Another `Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole `Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of `Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.It is impossible to speak of any one of the three movies as part of a trilogy of three independent works related by common characters, location, and history. `The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than `Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as `Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time.Like the movie version of `The Fellowship of the Ring', the `Return of the King' movie leaves off some important chapters. And, unlike the Tom Bombadil / Barrow Wight episodes in the first volume, the deleted `Scouring of the Shire' chapter in `Return of the King' created what was virtually the only real criticism of the movie, because the drama of `the scouring' was left out of the events between the celebrations in Gondor over the defeat of Sauron and the departures at the Gray Havens. So, we get a half-hour of celebrating and saying good-bye. Not too much in relation to the previous nine and a half hours, but a bit tedious in the context of a three hour movie. So, for the three of you who are reading the books for the first time, you have a great `lost' event to look forward to in reading `The Fellowship of the King'. As with the earlier two movies, Jackson has actually improved on virtually every scene he has touched. One of the very best scenes from `Lionheart' is Wallace's exhortation to his troops before their most important battle. Jackson has two such scenes in this movie, and each is both more powerful than anything Tolkien put into words and that Mel Gibson put onto the screen.One of the easily most important parts of the `Return of the King' book is the very long historical appendix which lays out the major events of the first three ages of Middle Earth. One of the most satisfying aspects of both `The Lord of the Rings' movie and book is the sense of the great depth of history. The appendices show that the history of the One Ring just scratches the surface, as Isildur wrested the ring from Sauron (see the opening scene of `Fellowship of the Rings') at the beginning of the Third Age. There are two earlier ages of Middle Earth from the time of the birth of the elves to the end of the first war with Sauron. It is a knowledge of this history which tells us why a ranger from the distant north is an heir to the throne of Gondor and why Denethor, the Steward cannot be King. One thing which amazes me is that no movie reviewer has noted the fact that Arwen and Aragorn are very, very, very distantly removed cousins, since it is quite possible that Elrond was the brother of Aragorn's great,....great grandfather. This is because Elrond and brother Elros Tar-Minyatar were given the choice of immortality as a half-elf or very long life and a homestead on the island of Numenor, removed from the sorrows of Middle Earth. Elrond chose immortality and `exile' to Middle Earth'. Elros chose long life on the Eden-like island. Another thing which seems to have escaped comment is the notion that kingship and right to rule can only pass from parent to child. It is amazing how quietly people accepted this undemocratic notion, although it would have been entirely logical to a mid-20th century Englishman.This appendix contains a great many other bits of miscellany. The most important for the movie is the story of the love between Arwen and Aragorn, which is not in the main narrative.This history is easily one of the most elaborate fictional histories created to date. Other fantasy histories such as Robert E. Heinlein's future history (in which he predicts the turmoil of the 1960's with amazing accuracy) is tiny in comparison.Truly great ending to the greatest fantasy cinema, ever. One of my favorite questions about movie fantasy is musing over what was the second greatest cinematic fantasy after `The Wizard of Oz'. This great ten-hour movie makes that question an almost trivial query about third place.	5.0	Last of Three Parts to the Greatest Fantasy Ever!	2005-05-13	2	1	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A8DMT4SCTANWI	"Bob ""bobsacamento"""	"I can accept a movie treatment compressing a book's dialog or leaving out scenes to make a story watchable in under three hours.  We've all got to go the bathroom eventually, after all.  What I can't understand is why Peter Jackson would actually *add* scenes and new fluff dialog to this already interminably long movie.  We get scenes of Liv Tyler as Arwen emoting with her father Elrond, Gollum successfully driving a wedge between Frodo and Sam (Say it isn't so!), Aragorn et al. in a battle of words with the spirits of the mountains and on and on.  And pretty much all the scenes from Tolkien's wonderful original are padded with useless new dialog.Someone out there is bound to say, ""Jackson was just developing characters!  He was exploring with them in new directions!""  In many other movies, I could accept this.  But if you are going to ""explore"" and ""develop"" the work of an author like Tolkien, you should ask yourself a couple of questions.  Like, ""Do I feel lucky?""  But, more importantly, ""Can my writers really write like Tolkien?""  The dialog from the new scene with Arwen and Elrond sounded like it was written for ""The Young and the Elvish,"" and the spot with Frodo and Sam breaking up was straight out of ""As Middle Earth Turns.""  I almost expected Frodo to snarl, ""If I can't have the ring, no one can!""  The scene with Aragorn and the mountain spirits put more corn on the screen than you can find in the entire state of Iowa.The mountain spirits scene was dreadful in pretty much all other aspects as well.  It looked just like Disney's Haunted Mansion.  (I don't mean the movie.  I mean the ride in Orlando.)  And Jackson's ""exploration"" of Aragorn's character here is inexcusable.  Tolkien's Aragorn had some trepidation about the task to which he was called, but he faced it through and through with manly courage.  If Jackson's Aragorn had waffled any more, we would have had to douse the screen with maple syrup.  Why Jackson gave this role to Viggo Mortensen instead of  Woody Allen is beyond me.The real crime here is that, to make room for this fluff, Jackson had to leave out some of Tolkien's most powerful scenes.  Gone is the final meeting of Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard.  I figured Jackson would put that in as an excuse for more sceptre-fu like we saw in the first movie.  Gone also is Gandalf confronting the Nazgul at the gate of Gondor.  Given the apparent appetite of Jackson or his FX crew for ""over the top"", I thought they would be like kids in a candy store here.  Maybe it was the PC reflex that led Jackson to give this scene to Eowyn the maid of Rohan.  The dialog between her and the Nazgul is truly Shakespearean:Nazgul: ""Do not come between a Nazgul and his prey!  No man can kill me!""Eowyn: ""But I am no *man*.""(Cue music: Helen Reddy's  ""I Am Woman.  Here Me Roar."")Missed most of all, the scouring of the Shire is completely gone.  I know this scene would be a little slow for the typical targeted audience of big budget cinema, i.e. over caffienated teeny boppers, but it was integral to Tolkien's story of a world where magic was disappearing and men (and Hobbits) would have to learn to live by their wits and their courage.But back to the Nazgul, his helmet looked like something Sauron had jury-rigged to pick up illegal satellite TV.  And his dialog, whether with Eowyn or with the Orcs under his command, was just stock action-movie bad-guy lines.  (""I will break him!"") But the real problem was that he just shouldn't have been given lines to say, or any close-ups either.  Tolkien showed us the forces of evil almost always, to borrow a theological term, ""from below.""  We hardly ever saw them ""in themselves"" but only as they were perceived by the frightened soldiers and hobbits.  This left them shrouded in a dark cloud of mystery that made them all the more terrifying.  The film's close-ups of the Nazgul and the orcs and so on exchanges the fear that can be generated by the imagination for cheap thrills at how great the movie's FX crew and costumers were.I have to hand it to Jackson, I was really surprised that he actually tried to give the movie's ending some of the same melancholy that we get in Tolkien's original.  But, as with pretty much all the other scenes in the movie, it would have been so much more effective without the bad soap opera poetics that the writers felt compelled to add.There was one shaft of sunlight piercing the Mordorean darkness of this film: Sean Astin's Samwise Gamgee.  Astin finally hits his stride in this last of the three LOTR movies.  His portrayal of the simple, tough, goodhearted hobbit called to do things he knows are beyond him is in perfect tune with the Sam Gamgee Tolkien gave us.  The Samwise he delivers really is the one that Tolkien created.  I have to wonder if Jackson was furious with him.I have to give this crime of cinema at least one star for Sean Astin.  It gets a second star because, since it ends pretty much the way Tolkien's book ended, and since there are no reports of Jackson giving into the pecuniary temptation to create a sequel, it implictly promises to be the last movie in this horrible series.  (Please!  Leave The Silmarillion alone!)  The cloud of Mordor is dispersed.  The suffering has ended.  I just wish the Age of Men were dawning in big budget cinema, an age where writers and directors would have to rely on attracting audiences with emotion and imagination, instead of grabbing fast bucks from teeny boppers with FX magic."	2.0	At Least It's Over	2004-05-21	17	10	7

But to say that this movie is a failure is to prove that one has no heart no soul no love and no clue as to what the Lord of the Rings is about.This version of the story really is a continuation of the dream begun by Tolkien and made visible for the ages by Peter Jackson and company.  If a single scene captures the essence of this entire trilogy it's not one of the great battles or one of the great speeches.  Rather it is that of Gandalf and the eagles appearing like a trio of angels to save Sam and Frodo.  The music with that visual chokes me up every time.The fellowship of the film has done us all a wonderful favor.  Now if only Peter can be persuaded to direct and star in The Hobbit.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A46A1LOTVJ5PL	Bola Onayemi	I love the Lord of the Rings movies, and LOTR: The Return of the King is quite a satisfying conclusion to the Peter Jackson trilogy.It's better than the previous two films, not in terms of story, as all three simply begin, continue, and end the story of the 'ring', but rather in terms of quality and expression.  You can tell that the filmmakers are really in their element by the time they work on this film, and all I could do was sit back and be filled with awe time and time again at the music, the imagery, the grandeur, the epic nature of the battles, the incredible effects, and the emotion.I see the whole trilogy as one movie now, but each part has a certain style different persons may prefer; 'Fellowship' was graceful and beautifully slow, capturing the feel of the shire, the argonath, moria and rivendell perfectly, showing off incredible music with each scene, a really well done introduction to middleearth, 'Towers' was a huge suprise to many with all its action and heart pumping visuals, taking the best action shots of the first film to the next level, like the 'balrog's fall' and the 'attack on isengard by the ents'; it created many new fans who thought middleearth was 'quite beautiful' but still 'quite boring', by really increasing the tempo of the story.  And gollum...oh, my, GOODNESS.  He was already so compelling (yet repulsive) in the first film...but NO ONE could have expected the endearing (chilling) performance he gave in the Two Towers.This third film, 'King', is my favorite though. I like it the most because it combined the graceful imagery and music of the first film, with the action and heartracing tempo of the second, and then added delicious layers of emotion again and again until the whole film just transcended genre and became a masterwork of cinematic expression that i have rarely ever experienced.  I felt like there was so much to take in that was enjoyable, that I would just have to see it again and again in order to fully get the most out of it - it was that amazing to me.  When it ends you realise you just can't hate something that has this much love of story and filmmaking written all over it.  You may not cry at how the story ends, but the experience stays with you long after it over, and should you see it again, you tear ducts may not react the same way.I highly recommend the filmed trilogy of the Lord of the Rings to everyone, especially those who are tired of the same old same old kinds of movies all the time (really - many more films lack exceptionality than not), or those just looking for something new or different, or unexpected.  This is a movie for the thinker who likes a slice of adventure, beauty, and music with his/her story. An epic adventure with beauty and heart, that isn't from the Lucas/Spielberg era...who could have expected it?	5.0	it sticks with you long after its all over	2004-03-19	3	3	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A36YH3VHK7050C	"Bola Onayemi ""kind_faramir"""	"This past week, I had the rare privilege of watching the Lord of the Rings with someone who had never seen it.  He is a friend of my youngest brother (17 years old, in High School), and I figured that if he was watching these films for the first time, he might as well watch the extended editions.He saw Fellowship 2 weekends ago and loved it.  Then he saw the Two Towers last Saturday, and was very eager to see the final chapter.  Incidentally, the last extended edition was out this past Tuesday, and yesterday, my brother, this friend and I sat for the Return of the King and watched it from beginning to end, integrated scenes and all.To be able to see the expressions of shock, wonder, suprise, and conviction as someone watches the Lord of the Rings movies for the first time; the feelings of cinematic release that I myself went through when I was introduced to these films, is quite hard to put in words.  Let's just say another fan has been added to the list.Just as magical was being able to suprise and shock my younger brother and his friends even more with the enriched history and sheer emotion of the books; describing the last chapter in the ""Two Towers"", and how intense 'The Choices of Master Samwise' is as you read it, and how you do not want to stop reading the rest of the story until the very cracks of Mount Doom have come and gone; seeing their eyes widen and their curiousity abound as I explain the history behind some of the amazing detail that has been included in these films, like Shelob's mother (Ungolianth), or Erendil's light; the saga of the Valar and the Silmarillon, and Morgorth and his many Balrogs.The best part of this experience in Middle Earth is more personal.  Last night my younger brother and his friend asked why, once the climax had passed, there was a need to show so much of the aftermath.  I realised then that while it took courage for Frodo and the fellowship to fight their battles and face their fears, especially with almost no hope; once the worst arrived, and the sacrifices were made, a new courage was needed, to face life after 'The End of All things', and to continue to live it.  I told them about the casualties of war, and how so many soldiers who have served and suffered, return home, only to find their lives can no longer be the same.  Many do not know how to go on living a normal life after experiencing the horror and pain that comes from war.  It takes courage to keep on living, to find happiness that brings peace.For me, this movie shows what courage is like - it shows the many forms of courage.  Not 6 months ago, my other, older brother (27 years old, graphic designer) died very suddenly, and tragically.  One moment very close, the next, ripped out of my life; once living and breathing, funny and God fearing, my mentor - my friend; now, only memories - many, many good, some sad, all, usually painful.  It takes courage to persevere past the pain of losing a loved one, and struggling, fighting to find meaning, happiness, and faith in life - happiness that will bring peace.These movies are much more than entertainment or great cinema, they are instruments of hope, spanning the spectrum of life's deepest sorrows, and most meaningful truths.  They are a treasure, truly, truly dear and precious to me.For that, I am thankful."	5.0	One of the most precious film treasures of our time...	2004-12-16	47	43	4

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3DM08AHYJHS0P	"""boxingelena2000"""	"Admittedly, I wasn't really into that whole ""Lord of the Rings"" hype at first. J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" was one of my favorite childhood books, and though I haven't read the ""LOTR"" trilogy, after watching Peter Jackson's (""Bad Taste"", ""The Frighteners"") first installment, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", I was mildly disappointed. I felt that the film, despite boasting some great performances, and spectacular special effects and cinematography, was a little too self-indulgent and grim.  In addition, I thought that the pace was lethargic - the film had too many `helicopter' shots of the main characters striding towards their destination. Since two more chapters were yet to come, I felt that the film should have had more than just numerous close-ups of weepy Elijah Wood's mug to compensate for the awareness that the goal would not be reached until the third part of the trilogy.  After all, this was supposed to be a grand fantasy for kids, and Peter Jackson failed to supplement the intermittent grandeur of impressive visual effects and mildly riveting suspense with the spine-tingling awe of, say, Wolfgang Petersen's ""NeverEnding Story"", or Bob Zemeckis' ""Back to the Future"" trilogy. ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was all impressive production value and epic scale, but no zest.""The Two Towers"", the second installment, further disheartened me - I considered its structure messy, its pace even more languid than in the previous chapter. The constant identical close-ups of Elijah Woods expressing distress annoyed me doubly, as did Elrond, played by Hugo Weaving in 'Agent Smith' mode. The talking trees kept my attention for a while, but then their mumbling, interweaved with gorgeous shots of the protagonists walking through snowy mountains and endless plains, soothed me to sleep. I did wake up to watch Arwen (Liv Tyler, unnaturally gorgeous with elf-ears); I was enthralled by Gollum (the subsequent media dissection of the character, how it was made, and the actor Andy Serkis diminished some of Gollum's wondrous appeal); I enjoyed Ian McKellen's wizard Gandalf (who, I think, kept truest to Tolkien's magical spirit); and the final battle was startling in its scale. Still, I walked out of the theater somewhat confused: why wouldn't Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin) just fly one of those long-necked dragons all that way to the ring, instead of conquering monsters in caves and all that stuff? And what's all the rage about Orlando Bloom's Legolas, who comes off as a sissy with his elfish ears and long shampooed blonde hair?With the third chapter, ""The Return of the King"", Peter Jackson manages to validate his commitment and affection for the saga, if not the preposterous publicity his films have triggered (one could get a specially designed ""Lord of the Rings"" Harley Davidson bike - what association does a motorcycle have with J.R.R. Tolkien?!) After watching the final episode of the saga, I recognized and grew to appreciate the fact that essentially, the director kept true to his vision throughout, handled a hell of a yarn, and ended it with a blast. The virtuosity of Peter Jackson's grip becomes most apparent in ""The Return of the King"" - the film made me temporarily forget how much I criticized the first two installments.Frodo and Sam continue their quest, as the film opens with a little prehistory of Gollum, revealing his origins. Back in the present, the little bastard cunningly attempts to grasp hold of ""the precious"". In the meantime, the power of the ring is taking hold of Frodo, who struggles to resist its evil, abandoning loyal Sam in the process. This is soon followed by a giant spider scene, which I feared, having just suffered through two painfully tiring hours of watching hundreds of CGI ""Eight Legged Freaks"". However, I found myself on the edge of my seat at the sight of unconscious Frodo getting tangled up in sticky web, as Sam hurries to his rescue.  More than that, I remained on the edge of my seat almost until the end, as opposed to slouching back all the way through the first two chapters. The reason for that is: ""The Return of the King"" works as a separate film, with freshness introduced to the material. Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) asking the ghost army for help is a brilliant scene that leads to a stunning pay-off. Aragorn's romance with Arwen also feels fresh - it lacks the sentimentality of their previous encounters. Legolas proves he's not a sissy in a jaw-dropping confrontation with a giant elephant (the elf literally SURFES on top of the creature, killing off the enemy in the process, as well as slaughtering the mammoth, and it all looks real.) The battle goes on forever, and is executed flawlessly - it is almost impossible to tell where the CGI is, and when an army crashes through the combating legion, the thunderous power of it all will take your breath away.In ""The Return of the King"", Peter Jackson has taken the best elements of the two previous chapters - the action, the effects, the cinematography, Ian McKellen - and elaborated them into unreserved sumptuousness. The exhilaration and the palpable enthusiasm of the director overshadow small inconsistencies reminiscent of the preceding chapters, such as some stretched-out parts, a lengthy triple-ending which is just about groan-inducing, and, of course, the frustrating determination to win 'Best Puppy Eyes' contest on Elijah Woods' part - kid's acting range is clearly limited. Sam's the one we're rooting for from beginning to end, but annoyingly, Frodo gets all the credit. In actuality, director Peter Jackson and his team of filmmakers deserve all the credit, for making the last installment of the saga the most faithful to the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien, or so I feel, even though my judgment is solely based on my memories of ""The Hobbit"". True aficionados of the writer might enjoy all three of the chapters, but in my opinion, only ""The Return of the King"" is the inspired cinematic masterpiece."	5.0	"""The Return of the King"" Marks the Return of Ingenuity"	2004-05-30	3	2	1

Although I loved the movie, I did have one complaint: the whole Saruman plotline is wrapped up in a really odd way.  (Peter Jackson promises that this will be rectified in the extended version.)

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AE5CO6BFF6IYD	"Brandon B. ""brndnb"""	NOTE: SEE OTHER 2 MOVIES IN ORDER BEFORE SEEING THIS ONE!!!!!The greatest movie trilogy of all time comes to an end in this spectacular movie.  I gave this movie 5 stars for a reason.  Years ago I heard everyone talking about this new movie coming out called the Lord of the Rings.  Personally I had never heard of the movie or even the books.  Before I went to the first movie, I read the first book.  After I saw the movie, I immediately read the 2nd and 3rd books.  These movies are powerful and exciting.  During half of this movie my mouth was hanging wide open.  I couldn't help it!  I tried eatcing popcorn and my jaw wouldn't shut to chew it.  I couldn't even drink my pop.  I was shocked and amazed at how many actors that I had never heard of could make a powerful book into an awesome movie.  The only actor in this movie I had ever heard of was Ian Mckellen and his appearance in X-Men.  But did that make a difference?  Heck no.  Let me get to what the movie is actually about.This movie starts out with a part that is actually written in the Fellowship of the Ring.  It was never put in until now.  At the very beginning it tells how Gollum came to be.  Then it picks up right where the Two Towers left off.  People were disappointed with the fact that last time they didn't get to see Shelob.  That was one of the main reasons I wanted to go and I was mad that she wasn't there (in the books she is in the Two Towers).  Waiting one more year was well worth it as Frodo and Sam battle the enormous spider trap that was set up by Gollum.  Gollum earns Frodo's trust in this movie and Sam doesn't trust Gollum at all.  Also, as Frodo and Sam move closer to Mordor, Sauron's ever-watchful eye is scanning Mordor.  So, Aragorn and Co. lead an army to the Black Gate to distract Sauron.  Then, Frodo starts giving out and Sam carries him to the cavern inside Mount Doom.  Here you can see what becomes of the ring and Gollum.  Barad Dur meets its match and Sauron along with it.  Bring some tissues along at the end.  I'm not gonna say anything about it.  See the movie or read the last chapter in the book to find out.I was disappointed that the Scouring of the Shire (read the book) was left out.  That was one of my personal favorite chapters (Sam is a stud in that chapter).  The hobbits take back the Shire in that chapter.  Here's how I rate the movie:Ratings out of 5.Storyline: 5Visual Effects: 5Score (sound and music): 5Overall: 5I can't rate this movie any other way.

I was actually surprised at the popularity of the movies.  I had always considered LOTR a kind of underground movement, and thought the audience wouldn't go much past people who were already into fantasy.  It's always been my favorite fantasy book and I re-read it every few years.  I did think that the long ending didn't fit a movie very well, there were several points towards the end where the credits could have started rolling and it would have been OK... but it kept going.....just like this review.  But I think that Peter Jackson was trying to keep true to the book as much as feasible, and appreciate all that.	5.0	Loved the book, loved the movie.	2004-11-21	2	1	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2S7EOOOJQGXN4	"Brian D. Gallof ""B. D. Gallof"""	"Star Wars has it's time and place...and sadly, it is the 70's and 80's, and in the 90's...the language, dimensions and magic fell flat as it became clear Lucas never grew up while locked in his ""castle"" over on Skywalker Ranch. Juxtaposed with that fallen star, is Peter Jacskon, a man who takes into his grubby, stubby little hands, that torch, and leaps to far new heights. And, we, the viewer, are led to the final tale that swept the Academy Awards for 11 golden men. The filmworld was silenced and trampled by this masterpiece of modern cinema...the melding of special effects, acting, high drama and powerful storytelling, and that was just to muzzle Michael Moore! ;)The modern myth...which is why I bring Star Wars into this little online review, because Lucas was a prime example in our late 20th century....was originally delivered far better by Tolkien during the dark days of a world at war and industrialization invading as a Brave New World came clear...and Tolkein wrote, with deep passion and love, a cautinary tale of power, atavism and imperialism railing against the common folk, who must forge old alliances to meet and triumph over the dark forces at work. Tolkein was a deeply relgious man, and his true faith was his trust in the good heart of man, or more aptly, hobbits. And through Hobbits, and their sincere and open humanity, would be the very fulcrum to meet and defeat the forces of evil.Peter Jackson uses the final film to paint the widest and most colorful brushstrokes of his great triptych. There is great unease and impending malice from the very beginning of the film, as he weaves Tolkein's characters to the final showdown that doesn't take place so much on the battlefield, but in Mordor, in it's very bowels...the future rests on two hobbits who face the biggest evil of them all, who Sauron truly represents...the evil of themselves/ourselves.With 50 more minutes and bountiful features galore, Return of the King is more than just the final chapter of a glorious 3 movie run that made us ALL children again in awe...but a start of a true melding of special effects/technology and the craft of filmaking/storytelling and acting...creating a masterpiece that has made an indelible mark upon film, the modern myth...besides my wallet, this holiday season."	5.0	The Greatest Epic in film history...	2004-12-14	7	5	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3TTK5BJ4JXZFJ	"Brian Libby ""Gadfly"""	"The 4-CD, Special Extended DVD Edition of RotK is available! No one will say you don't get a lot for your money. You can start watching it in high school and finish in old age. You pay only pennies per minute. But is it worth watching, even at so economical a rate?Some of it certainly is. Do not miss ""Home of the Horse Lords,"" one of the many appendices. This half-hour vignette is about the horses (and owners) who participated in LOTR. ""Home of the Horse Lords"" is charming, funny, moving, and interesting. And from these characteristics we can infer that Peter Jackson had nothing to do with it.The 76 scenes of the main feature (including 24 extended and 12 new ones) enshrine forever the Great Director's inability to tell drama from cheap sensationalism, his love of tawdry glitter, his littleness. Letting that man get his hands on Tolkien's trilogy was like putting a Stradivarius into the clutches of a destructive child.One could write a book on how bad it all is. Here I will just give one example: Watch scene 64, the Mouth of Sauron; then read pp.182-185 of Volume III. I cannot believe that anybody who does this could possibly fail to see how low, how plebeian, how stupid,is the film when compared to Tolkien's moving and dramatic scene--a scene that could easily have been in the film, had it been directed by a man of taste.The Great Director found his true field when he made his horror films. That sort of thing is the limit of his abilities. It was a ghastly error to turn him loose on a piece of great literature. All the splendid work of the talented folks in New Zealand--the Weta Workshop, the costumers and armorers, the miniature- and set-builders, the dedicated extras--was in the end brought to grief because the director was a (very) overgrown adolescent whose talent was so very, very limited.What a pity.

I am a true and very pleased fan with Peter Jackson's Trilogy, especially The Return of the king. The Plot is that The final battle for middle earth is about to begin and The battle takes place in the fields of the pelennor and The black gates of Mordor. This movie was a great experience, everything was just perfect as it was! Mostly nothing was wrong with it! The script was beautiful, The Lord of the rings trilogy was written by J.R.R Tolkein, a fantastic story writer and the script for the actual movie was supurb! It flowed so well with the sorroundings and it was easy to understand and comprehend and still get the emotion with it. The battle scenes were THE BEST! I just loved every minute of it. The special effects were so real and so exciting! So action packed ( though sometimes it can go allitle far but we still enjoy it....). I have been a Enormous fan for The score music for the return of the king and the music fitted so well, there was a mixture of slow but beautiful and heroic and energetic which, with the film made your back tingle in happiness :).The acting was what made the film connect with so many people. It was realistic, not corny. Their eyes, their facial expression, I could feel their emotion, therefore, I cried like a baby 4 times and other people cried too in the cinema. When I was in the theaters, people were so engaged with the film, they started to Cheer. Some people would think this would be annoying BUT! bevause we now it is so good.. why not join them???Emotion, music acting and realism, story are the key things that all directors should take account for... The return of the king has done all of this and this is ultimatly one of the most perfect epic films ever made. I just loved this film. fabulous.The dvd is not worth getting unless you want just the theatrical stuff and don't bother with the extras. There are many things that P.J left out in Return of the king and waiting for the extended edition is something I cannot wait sitting still.Overall, I have said it before, FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thankyou Peter Jackson, it has been a great three years and thankyou for the journey you took us,5 Stars = 100%	5.0	A pure classic!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3T8G3FN3H3948	bryhil_04	The first movie was very dull and kinda boring. I saw the second one in the theatres, in was boiling hot, my Uncle was snorting continuously, the chairs were uncomfortable and the movie was just good enough, but not great enough to beat all the other unpleasentaries surrounding me. So, I come into this movie thinking it will just be like the rest of them, man, was I wrong. This is by far the best of three and the only one I would praise out of this trilogy. The ending is sad, yet happy and The WitchKing is the best bad guy yet. Plus, he can't help but love good old Gandolf. He makes his appearences in this movie much more notable then the first two, and even Frodo managed to get on my good side. This movie is terrific and if I were to go back and watch the first two now, I think it would be much more delightful and interesting. It's just a shame that they couldn't have made the first one like this because then I would have been fascinated from the beginning... and this is a great series to get in to because they have so much from this series. Overall, it's packed with excitement, good acting and a strong plot that builds throughout the trilogy. There is nothing more that I liked about this trilogy then the plot, the acting was always shaky in the first two, but they pull out of shaky and go to great in this one. Overall, it's a must see for anyone.	5.0	After a long wait...	2004-11-02	4	2	2

Semon ""a HUGE fan"""	"First off, those of you saying this is a kid's movie . . .o please . . . .as many people think, LOTR is not a cutesy little fairy tale about a fantastic (meaning something in a fantasy) hero who saves the day.  LOTR is a war movie.  If you bothered watching any of the interviews, they will say that Tolkien wrote these books based on his experiences in WWII.  He hated war.  Saruman is a fantastic version of Hitler.  The power of the ring if often discussed.  The ring itself has no power . . . the power of the ring is the FEAR it creates . . .""a nameless fear"" (quote from the movie).  Tolkien wrote the books as though it were history.  Peter Jackson does a wonderful job of creating this ""realism.""  Honestly, I watch other movies now (such as Spiderman) and don't enjoy them near as much because of the lack of realism.  Frodo is no Hercules.  His strong friendship with Sam and his pitty for Gollum alone save him.  The civilizations in Middle Earth are based on old European civilizations.  Rohan, for example, is based on the Anglo-Saxon society.  All the names relating to Rohan contain a prefix meaning ""horses.""  You can find that out reading the Appendixes.  The Appendixes also make this story seem so real.  Any facts you need to know about the history of Middle Earth can be found in it.  Very rarely will you find something like this in a fictional book.  Only non-fiction history books are that organized.  Tolkien set a new standard for books.  At the time this was written, nothing like LOTR was around.  It was originally supposed to be in one-volume.  Tolkien much disliked the idea of splitting up the books, but at that time, paper was very expensive and the book would be too highly priced to get many sales, so his publishers agreed to split the book.  It took a while for LOTR to catch on, but eventually, people all around the world began reading it and it became the trilogy it is today."	5.0	Truly Unbelievable	2004-09-21	6	5	1

Having said that I will also point out that you can't replace or recapture the essence of a book on the TV screen no matter what. They are different mediums...Hard-core fans will no doublt want to get the Extended Editions, but even this standard edition is loaded with bonus materials, including an excellent National Geographic documentary. This is one of the rare cases where having both standard and extended DVD editions is great :-)Highly recommended, if you are unfamiliar with this trilogy, make sure you start from the first movie ""Fellowship of the ring"", then watch the 2nd movie ""Two towers"" and then this one which concludes the movie trilogy.Unlike most of today's science/fantasy movies which are like dining at a fast food restaurant, the LOTR trilogy is the gourmet 5-star restaurant dining experience.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3HTX1NOTTWERP	Busy Body	"I'll say it right off the bat: ""The Lord Of The Rings"" is simply the greatest, most astounding movie trilogy of all time. I'll say this ever quicker: ""The Return Of The King"" is the greatest film in history. There are simply no words to describe my love for this film. It goes beyond an obsession, beyond a craze and the same can be said for most of the world. The recipient of 11 Oscars in February 2004, the film deserved every single one, and then some. The film has also grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, becoming only the second film in history to do so. ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"" are both classic movies which opened up J.R.R. Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth to the world. Director Peter Jackson had the vision and put it on screen to create two of the most astounding action fantasy epics in history. However, both pale in comparison to the masterpiece of gargantuan proportions that is The Return Of The King.Although Saruman (Christoper Lee) has been defeated, the battle is not quite over. The quest for Middle Earth is just beginning, in fact. In a last attempt to annihilate the race of men, Sauron assembles his army of Orcs to launch a devastating attack on the capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith. The capital is currently being ruled by the rather insane Denethor (John Noble), father of Faramir and the now-dead Boromir. He has no hope in the capital and will not assemble an army in preparation for an attack. As all this is going on, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join forces with Theoden (Bernard Hill) as they prepare for battle at Minas Tirith. Despite assembling an army of Rohan residents to fight, they are significantly outnumbered by Sauron's forces. Their solution to go deep into a cursed mountain proves inspirational. The discovery of the ghosts in their sea of lush green makes for most impressive viewing and this is fully realised upon their attack at Minas Tirith. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) is also astounding once again in his role, and lifts the spirits of millions.Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum continue their trek to Mount Doom in their unwavering quest to destroy the One Ring. Along the way the ring threatens to destroy their plans, as does Gollum whose evil side is more prominent than before. Despite other astounding moments in the film, we must not forget that this is the movie's main story. Their arrival at the great staircase is phenomenal, and made even more memorable by the enormous green bolt shooting through the sky. The broken relationship between Frodo and Sam due to Gollum's interference is heartbreaking and proves the film still sticking to the emotional side of the book. The spider scenes are at times scary, but always entertaining. The journey to Mount Doom is the most anticipated ever seen on film surely, and the final scenes within the mountain are just complete overload. You're on the edge of your seat and nothing is going to tear you away.The best moments arrive with the battle scenes at Minas Tirith. The massive boulders that are launched from each side are some of the most impressive weapons ever seen, and the arrival of Nazgul's is absolutely breathtaking. The way they soar over the mountains is just awe-inspiring and the screeching they make truly was deafening in the cinema. The sheer amount of Orcs preparing to rip the place to the ground is amazing. There must be hundreds of thousands covering miles and miles of land - it makes the battle at Helm's Deep in The Two Towers look like a child's ice cream fight. The lighting of the beacons, the enormous battering ram that breaks through doors and the arrival of the Rohan army to kill off the Orcs is fascinating, pulse-racing viewing. However, nothing can prepare the viewer for the arrival of the eight-story mammoth elephants that mark their arrival with horns as they swish their trunks/tusks through the air, destroying hundreds in their sweeps.What is most astounding about these moments are way in which Jackson constantly cuts from eye-popping bonanza action to emotional and intimate moments. For instance, as the camera rides on the back of a boulder tearing through the sky and crushing a hundred Orcs, we then witness Pippin (Billy Boyd) holding his ears and crying to the heavens as manic fear surround him, before he kills his first Orc. Or with Merry (Domanic Monaghan) riding with Eowyn (Miranda Otto) on their horse and the defeat of Sauron. It's heavy and beautiful, as is the scenes between Arwen (Liv Tyler) and her father Elrond (Hugo Weaving). Then more breathtaking, open-air battles, followed by textured and poignant moments of friendship, hope and the will to survive. This is what makes the film so spectacular. Obviously, it would be nothing without the stunning special effects, but its the relation between the emotion and action that makes it all so brilliant.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10As the final fifteen minutes of The Return Of The King roll on you're left with a feeling of amazement, of astounding satisfaction in the fact that you know this is the greatest film of all time. Your nerves balance on the edge of oblivion, waiting to see if Frodo drops the ring into the fire or not. I give many thanks to Peter Jackson for displaying his vision and creativity. He is truly a genius and this film will be remembered for generations to come."	5.0	The Greatest Motion Picture Masterpiece In History	2004-04-04	12	10	2

By the time the little fella was getting married I was about to hang myself with my belt, I mean what would have been so bad with ending it at the castle? Them riding back into town and everyone looking at them...yawn. who mowed Frodos lawn while he was gone? Wouldn't he owe some back taxes? Did the other 3 little fellas lose their jobs as well? What are they going to do for dental?All I am saying is the last 45 minutes is worse in the thatre than at home, because at least you can get up and do some bow flex or something during that time, or make something to eat.

Tolkien would not be happy with this translation of his book. Peter Jackson has done a magnificent job of making the books come to life. This last installment of the Trilogy was incredible in scope and action. The director smoothly transitioned us back and forth between Frodo and Samwise's incredible trek to destroy the ring at Mount Doom and the fight of Arogorn for his throne and the destruction of Sauron. The battle scenes were unbelievable. The special effects were great. The number and types of creatures filled one with awe. The acting, scenery, sets, music, and all facets of this film are magnificent. I loved it all. The softer ending with Sam's writing the final chapter of &quot;There and Back Again&quot; made it a little easier to come to the final conclusion that we all hate to see. I and many others I'm sure wish it would never end. I hope that Peter Jackson will seriously consider doing a movie of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. He certainly has the knack for putting Tolkien's words to film. This 2 DVD set quality is as good as it gets. It includes many extras along with the standard commentaries and documentary to many details of the making of it. Any fan of the other two movies will love it and anyone not familiar with these movies will enjoy them if they enjoy fantasy movies like &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; and &quot;Dragonheart&quot;.	5.0	Tolkien must be smiling	2004-06-03	4	3	1

It's like a whole new movie! I've been very pleased with all the extended editions thus far, but this one just made Return of the King my indisputable favorite of the series. As much as I enjoyed the theatrical version, I felt that after the battle of the Pelennor Fields the movie lost its pace and rushed through the final sequences just to cover the remaining bulk of the story. (Similar to how the theatrical version of Fellowship felt after losing Gandalf in the mines of Moria.) Fret not! All has been remedied.Enough has been said about the inclusion of Saruman's demise and I agree with the sentiments that it really sets up the emotions of the film. I understand the reasons for why it was not included, but still it was a pity that it did not make the original cut. Great stuff.However, hat's off to this new final act. An extended Cirith Ungol sequence, Aragorn's confrontation with Sauron in the Palantir, Frodo and Sam getting caught up in the orc army and last but certainly not least- the encounter with the Mouth of Sauron (talk about creepy!!) add much needed tension and drama. The growth of Aragorn from ranger to king was also far more palpable and satisfying as his additional scenes provide more depth and insight into his character.Alas, there certainly are some scenes that were very loosely adapted from Tolkien's original text and may get a few people in an uproar, but I resigned myself to those kinds of changes ever since the day Aragorn went over that cliff. I've come to realize that these films are a labour of love and are the only movie adaptation of its kind that I will likely ever get to see in my lifetime. I'm just happy someone had the guts to try to film the unfilmable and to do it with such passion. It's been a great ride!	5.0	Best Extended Edition Yet	2004-12-17	13	11	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3CX6923NJPC40	Carl Gobelman	We can get into all kinds of debates as to whether or not ROTK should be considered with the all-time great movies ever, or whether it deserved 11 Oscars, etc.  The bottom line is the ROTK, and the entire LOTR series is easily the best fantasy movie to hit the screen.  PERIOD!First off, the film were adapted from the best fantasy literature has to offer, Tolkien's LOTR trilogy!  No other fantasy movie to my recollection boasts such strong source material.  Second, and this may anger some LOTR purists, but I feel the movies were faithful to the spirit of Tolkien, if not always to the letter of Tolkien.  Let's face it, you couldn't take LOTR and make a movie without some alterations.  The written word flows much differently than a live movie.  Frankly, I wouldn't want to sit through a completely faithful rendition of Tolkein; it'd be waaaay too long and too slow in many parts.  Third, this series of movies took special FX to a whole new level!  The battle sequences were--in a word--AWESOME!The amazing thing of it all is the three theatrical releases totaled 9 hours and 20 minutes, and it still seemed too short!  Take into account the nearly extra 2 hours of material in the extended editions, and there was still stuff that had to be cut out.  It pains me to read some of the reviews or talk to some of my Tolkien purist friends and hear them complain.  I don't envy Peter Jackson's position in this.  He was in the unenviable position of taking one of the most loved books of all time and making it into a movie; knowing ahead of time that picky purists would complain.  In all honesty, I think after watching all three movies that Peter Jackson managed to capture the main story line extremely well.  A person who never heard of Tolkien before (like my kids) could watch the movies and enjoy them immensely.  As a side-note, think of the interest Jackosn's films have generated in Tolkien's books.  People who have never read the books are reading them.I think this movie, and the two previous ones, are completely deserving of all the accolades they have received!	5.0	A true masterpiece!	2004-12-15	5	5	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	APD0A1BERBRH6	Carl Townsend	"I may be in the minority, but I personally feel Peter Jackson made two major mistakes with this movie and let his viewers down. I still think it's a great movie and probably should get the rewards it will get (and you should see it), but it is not The Return of the King that Tolkien wrote and you need to read the book to fully understand why. Here are the reasons:First, the Scouring of the Shire was completely omitted from the movie. Peter Jackson's claim that this is anticlimactic is far, far from the truth. In fact, it is climatic and that's why Tolkien put it in. There are three basic needs for a man: an adventure to go on, a battle to fight, and a pursuit (of the woman). You see all three of these in movies such as Braveheart. A young man needs to hear from his father that he has strength for the adventure, battle, and pursuit. Without this, a man is serverely wounded. Instead of being a stallion, he becomes a gelding, and one of the key problems of the church today is we have these geldings instead of stallions, and geldings cannot bear fruit.Frodo has these same needs. In the Scouring (the book), we see Frodo returning to his ""Place"" (Hobbiton) after it has been destroyed by Saruman. Frodo is in a massive depression. He essentially failed his mission (he didn't put the ring in the volcano) and is burdened by his guilt, failure, and physical infirmitiess. On his return to ""Place"", however, he takes on his masculinity and leads the hobbits in restoring their community (""Place""). Frodo leaves the story as a true hero. That's climatic, not anticlimactic.Second, the Houses of Healing incident was completely omitted from the movie. In the book story Eowyn, Faramir, and Merry lie dying in the houses of healing. Ioreth, the lady attending them, says their healing is beyond her power. ""The hands of the king are the hands of a healer,"" she says, "" And so shall the rightful king be known."" It is Aragorn, the coming king, that enters and leads all three to their healing. Tolkien pulls a little psychological trick here in the book. After the healing Ioreth repeats the sentence again, acknowledging her perception of Aragorn as the coming king because he can heal. She seems to repeat this line again and again until Aragorn is crowned as king. She tries to repeat the line again, but fails as the trumpet drowns out her voice. By this time, however, the reader is completing the line; that is, the reader is being forced to take ownership on that statement.Now Tolkien was a devout Christian (Catholic), and was the man that led C.S. Lewis to the Lord. Tolkien is not talking about any earthly king or kingdom here. When I read this in Tolkien's book I wept. I think it's the most important quote in the book, but it's not even in the movie. It is a great movie, but it is not The Return of the King if you can't see why he is king.My guess is that Peter Jackson probably didn't understand the spiritual significance of either of these parts of Tolkien's novel. That's unfortunate, as both are the highest points of Tolkien's story.In all fairness, I think Peter did a more than remarkable job with The Two Towers. I see King Theoden, as he first appears, as the majority of the Church today, captured and powerless and not even knowing what is going on. Our heroes heal him and release his bondage, and his people rejoice to have their king again. Aragorn, knowing war has already started and Theoden's son has died in a battle, tries to encourage him to get ready.Theoden: I will not risk open war.Aragorn: Open war is upon you, whether you risk it or not.That is exactly where the Church is today. Christ said he gave his followers authority and power. To do what? That is what the Gospels are all about. There is a war going on, whether we risk it or not."	3.0	Jackson let me down.	2004-01-15	47	12	35

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2YVV3TCN3SUMR	Cate	"""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is the final chapter in one amazing trilogy. I had never heard of the books, but thought the first two movies were very good and enjoyed them thoroughly. They tell the story of a horrible ring, created out of pure evil that gives you the power to take over the world if you wear it. It's creator is trying to get back to it, and it must be destroyed. Enter Frodo Baggins, a hobbit (they're just humble beings that live peacefully) who inherits the ring from his uncle, Bilbo, who found it on a journey many years before. With the help of his friends, Frodo must go to Mount Doom, where it's lava is the only thing that can destroy the cursed ring. When you've seen the first two, there's no WAY you're not going to want to see the last one. And it was amazing on so many levels.First of all, it's visually stunning. The sweeping landscapes, the choreographed battles, it's all so pleasing to watch. They really picked a beautiful place (New Zealand) to film these movies.Second, the characters are so multi-dimentional and lovable (or hateable, in some cases). Aragorn (one of my favorite characters), the brave, handsome man that has to lead the men of Middle-Earth into victory. Gandalf, the oh-so-wise wizard that is guiding everyone on their quest. Frodo, the little hobbit that has the biggest job of all, to get the horrible ring to Mount Doom and destroy it.

If you're a LotR fan, spend the few extra bucks to get your hands on the extended edition/Verison. You see extra scenes and extended scenes that help add more to the overall storyline.

But, I was totally immersed in it and felt it one of the best pictures I have seen.  The acting was above great, the action supurb, and Jackson's directing beyond anything done by others.  This is a wonderful ending to the best series of movies ever made.  I read &quot;poohs&quot; at the special effects from National Geographic, but I found it vastly interesting and had enough sense to know that it was opinions of various historians and it just added to it all for me.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1N00127IDBHD6	CConn	If I were called to describe the three chapters of the Lord of the Ring Trilogy in one word, I would probably call The Fellowship of the Ring Serine with it's peaceful shots of the Shire, elf villages, and forests. The Two Towers, I'd call Hectic, with our heroes dashing to and fro trying to accomplishmultiple tasks. As for The Return of the King, that one word that explains it perfectly is: Chaos.If asked to explain the plot, I'd simply reply Chaos, pure Chaos, with Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas, along with the Wizard Gandalf preparing, then engaging in multiple battles, with multiple armies, some of whom, aren't even of this earth. Chaos explains the journey of Frodo Baggins, and Sam Gamgee as they seem simply to craw along mountain tops in agony, desperately trying to reach their destination, as every second seems like an eternity. Or as they try to deduce the true motives of the multiple personality impaired Gollum, who makes their journey all the more daunting.Chaos explains the cinematography of the film. In the first film, most shots contained the green hue of tree leafs and grass. In the second chapter, the hue was now gray with rock. Now that hue has changed to the blood red of fire and lava. The amazing landscape shots look as though they should be plastered on the ceiling of a Roman Church. That's how good the camera work is in this film. The cinematographer has seemed to transcend film from being merely a bland, uneventful window into a story world, to being an actual art form.Chaos explains the attitudes of all the characters, whom through the film seem as though they've been beaten to a bloody pulp, both physically, and mentally. Not to sound mocking, but in every scene in which he is present, Frodo seems as though he is half dead, every word spoken seems painful, every movement seems agonizing. Likewise for Sam, who's always-look-on-the-bright-side attitude is battered throughout the film. The rest of the cast's demeanors are all taunt and intense, obviously because through the course of the movie, they fight at least three major battles.And as for the battles, guess what. Chaos also explains them as well. Giant elephants, ghost armies, dragon-like birds, and giant (equipped human intelligence) eagles, not to mention the hob-goblin-like Orcs, all are involved in skirmishes in this movie. All these grandiose spectacles add to all of the battle scenes making them even more (guess what!) chaotic then one would think possible. What more could you possibly want?Something I like to ignore in reviews I simply must mention in this one: special effects. As I said, I really don't like to talk about SF because they are used just too much these day, and usually, are not important at all in the movie. But, and this is a big but, this film proves my two beliefs wrong, with a character like Gollum, the SF does become a storyline, and with hard-to-tell effects and blending, ROTK doesn't become over-reliant on effects, making the movie's SF extremely enjoyable.The musical score is good to, having several strong and enjoyable main themes, that are delivered at opportune times in the film. Though, as my one criticism of the film, I have to wonder if the score would have been better if, say, John Williams was drafted to do the score instead of Howard Shore...But really the best thing about this film, is how all the necessary sections come to together perfectly: acting, story, cinematography, special effects, musical score, and just overall heart and sincerity, make what this movie is; one of the best ever made...Oh, and just in case you were wondering; yes, The Return of the King does deserve every single one of those eleven Oscars. It should have been twelve even; Why it wasn't nominated for Cinematography, I'll never know.	5.0	Chaos, Pure Chaos.	2004-03-01	7	6	1

It concerns the hobbits.  The story comes full circle as it should be.  However, my only concern about the film comes at the expense of the ending as well.  It was too abreviated.  So many great chapters and scenes from the book didn't make it into the film, post-Mt. Doom.  I want more.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A393ASBSKO7BHR	Cecilia A. Camacho	The only thing I found especially shortchanged was the House of Healing segment; I was particularly looking forward to the encounter between Aragon and Faramir.  There is something biblical about the image of Aragorn the Healer which was not developed in this extended version either.  Very much appreciated was the confrontation scene between Faramir and Denethor and the exchange between Pippin and Faramir which established a comradery that better supports the later developments.  I noted that the extended edition gave a superficial but poetic gesture towards depicting the relationship between Faramir and Eowyn.  I appreciate the challenges of keeping the overall pace of the movie and avoiding losing focus by developing secondary story lines, but fans of Faramir and Eowyn are going to be disappointed.	5.0	Almost Perfect	2004-12-17	8	6	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AK091BFCPVBY9	ceeb	"As far as ROTK and the series goes, Jackson did all right. I generally agree with most of the points made in the positive reviews, and even a few of the negative ones to some degree. And I could have done without the Legolas ""eXtreme"" skate-rail grind on the shield scene, and I think there were a few too many shots of grime-covered orcs and Uruk-Hai snarling (do they snarl 24/7?). And certainly, Saruman and Wormtongue were poorly portrayed. However, Elijah and Sean nailed their characters (no pun intended relating to the homoerotic relationship between Sam and Frodo) as best as anyone could have hoped, McKellan was perfect, and the production values soared like deus ex machina eagles. ;-)It's not perfect, but as a whole a respectable adaptation. I left feeling more impressed with the visuals than any psychological gravitas (say, the way Apocalypse Now left me emotionally drained) but it's hard not to recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Tolkein and the fantasy genre. It's an epic popcorn series that goes several layers deeper than any Schwarzenegger fare could have hoped.However, what irks me isn't the flaws of the trilogy. It's the marketing types who you KNOW will soon create several ""new editions"" of the entire trilogy year after year to bait purists into shilling out more cash for what they essentially already have. I predict by Xmas 2005, there will be an all-encompassing edition of all three films in one collector's set, and--mark my words--it'll have a few more extras to entice reselling the same product again to the same people. Wonder where those shire scouring scenes went? Just wait... And then comes the DivX version. and then the Superbit version. And then the Enhanced Superbit version. And then the Hi-Def version. And then the Hi-Def Collector's Edition. And then the 10th Anniversary Edition, signed by Peter Jackson, and including yet more scenes that weren't added to the previous 9 editions, plus a nude picture of Liv Tyler for fanboys. And... ad nauseum. Grr. Sure, caveat emptor and all, but one has to acknowledge the continuing rampant greed and lack of ethos.So I say screw the evil marketing types. Don't buy the DVDs.

In this case, skin color is a non-factor.If anything, this film series turns the notion of white and black as good and evil on it's ear, because the villainous Sarumon was a ""White"" Wizard before Gandalf became so...and it's his evil army that bore the mark of the ""White Hand of Sarumon"" on their faces and armor!Obviously the African American Film Critics Association didn't detect any racism when they chose Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King as the best film of the year, and neither should anyone else!"	5.0	A Question of Racism?	2004-01-13	15	14	1

Being a typical average teenage girl, I was not particularly excited when I was dragged to see the Fellowship three years ago. In fact, if it werent for the extremely sexy cast including Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood, and Dom Monaghan, I may not have gone at all. As it turned out, even if Elijah looked like my math teacher, this movie would still be well worth seeing. Now that the third installment is finally out, it has only gotten better. These movies have everything, great acting, directing, action, adventure, and even romance. The third is by far the most emotional, having felt like you have known these characters for years. While in the theatre, I remember thinking 'two hours left, THATS IT?'. Peter Jackson found the perfect harmony within the cast and crew, and their real life love for one another is obvious in the movies. You will be just as hesitant to say goodbye as they must have been. Having seen it several times now, I have two tips; don't miss out on the most epic  triology of the century just because it is not a shallow makeout movie.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1JBQMLD12QMQZ	"Christian Keller ""Dancing Fool"""	"The thing that is interesting about the block-buster Lord Of The Rings trilogy is that the films are filled with battles, both huge and one-on-one and amazing special effects shots, yet it never loses the focus on relationships, and people. Nowhere is this more evident than in Return Of The King.The film focuses on the relations between various characters.Sam and Frodo's relationship is jeopardized by Gollum, who wants to be rid of Sam because ""the stupid fat hobbit knows"" of his plan to take back the ring. When he does drive a wedge between the two, Sam is sent back home while Frodo attempts to finish his quest. The emotions are churning at this point, and the sadness and betrayal on Sam's face are heartbreaking. Sam does realize that Frodo needs him when he discovers proof of Gollum's treachery, and comes back just in time to prevent tragedy.When Sauron's plot to attack Minas Tirith is uncovered by the rest of the fellowship, Gandalf and Pippin head to Gondor's capital, Minas Tirith. Here we see that the Steward has learned of Boromir's death, and his grief causes his other son, Faramir to observe that his father wish the two sons' places had been reversed. This leads to another heartrending scene, in which Faramir's attempt to prove his worth to his father results in tragedy.Rohan's army is called for to assist in the defense of Gondor, and we discover that Eowyn's love of Aragorn is unrequited She elects to go to battle, disguised as a man. When her uncle, King Theoden, is attacked by the Witch King and his fell beast, Eowyn is the one to come between them. Due to a prophesy that no man may kill this wraith, Eowyn is the only one who can destroy him. It was a thrill when she whips off her helmet to say ""I am no man!"" and plunges her sword into his face. Total girl-power moment.Of course there are many other thrilling moments that I could describe, but this review is dragging on too long. Suffice it to say that the battle scenes are exciting, but the story is really about people, not special effects.And for those who have heard the end drags on too long, ignore those who tell you that. They have no taste, and must have expecting ""Terminator 4: Rise of the Orcs"" or ""2 Fast 2 Hobbity"" instead of a real cinema treat."	5.0	More Than Just Big Battles and CGI Fun	2004-01-16	6	4	2

Brown ""amateur reviewer"""	This is an excellent film, the most enjoyable of the three LOTR movies.  The battle scenes are magnificent.  The love and friendship between the characters will move you.However, I cannot give 5 stars to this DVD because a better DVD exists... the Extended Edition of this movie.  If you love this movie enough to buy it, you should spend the extra cash to get the extended edition DVD (which has an extra hour of additional footage).Without the additional footage, this film still works.  Everything in the story makes sense and is held together well.  However, the extra footage ties up more loose ends and gives you the pleasure of spending a little more time in Middle-earth.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A8MOBUTMII8OM	Christopher	"It is hard to caputer with words the emotions that resonate so profoundly throughout this film. Upon my first viewing I was struck awe at the shear size and spectacle of everything that was transpiring before me. I cringed in horror at the moment when Frodo was stung by the hideous spider Shelob, I cheered when Sam charged the tower of Cirith Ungol to save his dear friend (what amazing courage) and I wept when Sam told Frodo on the slopes of Mount Doom, ""I can't carry it for you Mr. Frodo, but I can carry you!"". These scenes are just a few examples of what this film has acheived, in truth there are far too many to name here. While there are some who will complain that the film had one too many endings, as fan of both the book and the movie I felt that every ending was absolutely necessary to bring this epic saga to a proper close.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3VHO2HU2S1SXW	C. Huston	"Yes, the trilogy is beautiful, awe-inspiring, magnificent, etc.BUT...there are two areas in which I found both the theatrical and EE deficient.First:  You remember in ""Fellowship"", Frodo puts on the ring three times, and Peter takes us all three times into the shadowy world that results.  Killer stuff.  Ever since ""Fellowship"" I'd been waiting for what would happen when Frodo puts on the ring at the brink of Mt. Doom.  It could have been incredible--Frodo's heightened sense of Sauron, and edits back and forth between Gollum's weird fight-with-thin-air, and Frodo's perception of the fight from inside the wraith-world.  But all we got from the theatrical was Gollum bouncing around in the air.  I held out some hopes this would be improved in the EE, but it wasn't. Opportunity lost.Second:  A semi-glaring plot defect in the theatrical was the omission of Denethor's palantir--the reason why he was such a deluded, depressed mess.  Surely this would be corrected in the EE, I thought.  But again, no.  The palantir Aragorn uses towards the end MIGHT have been Denethor's, but might also have been the one Gandalf confiscated from Orthanc.  It's not really clear.  Either way, Peter's omission left Denethor's character motivation unclear.  My wife, who never waded through the book, said, ""Well, I assumed he was just kind of crazy.""Anyway--those are my gripes.  Probably small in the grand scheme of things.  For the remaining 99.9% of the movie, Hail Peter!  Your incredible work will stand for a lifetime."	5.0	Loved it--but I have two gripes	2004-12-15	5	5	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3P2POCHUYTJO4	clang_the_o	"All great films have something in common, characteristics that are evident with each viewing.  They are beautifully moving.  They are empathetic and tender, and terrifically entertaining--exuding a delightful energy that seems to spread throughout your entire body when watching them.  You are inevitably charmed by a great film's complexities, enamored of its giddy humor, and never fail to cry nearly every time you watch it--hoping in some remote fashion that the ending, perhaps this time, will shift just a bit.  These are the hallmarks of a great cinematic experience, and they are completely embodied in a remarkable piece of filmmaking...""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.""People have spoken of the grandeur of ""King,"" of its sprawling scope and intoxicating scenic beauty.  The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those experiences that, when passing a room where it is playing, a person is made to pause and take note--much in the same way as one would pause in front of a beautiful painting in a museum.  The intimate close-ups and large sweeping vistas leave you breathless before hearing the first word of dialogue.  You do not have to like Tolkien to acknowledge the sheer splendor and aesthetic value of these films.It is the human element, however, that drives ""King"" to its paramount perfection.  Elijah Wood (who is strangely rarely spoken of as the keystone of these films) is the perfect Frodo: Cherubic and strong, and consummately overwhelmed by the task given him.  His haunting blue eyes reflect the innocent naivet&eacute; of the Hobbit clan--within his steal-blue gaze you can almost see his old life in the Shire, the sunny dales and sprawling green pastures, a bittersweet recollection of a former life.  Reflected also is the stricken reality of his present situation...the horror of foresight, knowing he may never return from his quest.  As for his role in ""Return of the Kings,"" Elijah Wood's performance cuts like a sharpened blade, stealthy and determined and wholly unaware of its own strength.  Important also is the fact that young Frodo is essential growing into an adult, under the harshest and most unforgiving of circumstances.  Wood conveys this beautiful, often with no more than a stricken, soulful glance in Sam's direction.  His most riveting moments, however, are often by himself, silently tortured by the burden of bearing the One Ring.  Watching this movie you can hardly wait for his next appearance, even with the knowledge that with every scene we become closer and closer to the certainty of his suffering.The Hobbits as a whole have an innocent, androgynous beauty...they are entirely believable as these brave little beings of substance, joy, and love for the simplicity of life.  Samwise, as Frodo's loyal companion, steals nearly every scene--his sincerity and strength is the backbone of their relationship, and perhaps, of the film entirely.  He is heroic in every pure since of the word, his obligations demand nothing less.  Sam is solid and unwavering in his devotion, and he more often than not tends to lead Frodo instead of following him.  Without Sam's unwavering sensibility and purity of spirit, the fate of Middle Earth would have never turned favor.  Sean Astin does a wonderful job here, his Sam is well-timed, sensitive and moving.  If it were left up to me, a Supporting Actor Oscar would be in order here.  His Sam fills the screen with an assuredness that is rarely scene on film.Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are not to be overlooked.  Their exuberant performances are filled with clarity and nuance.  The characters of Merry and Pippin play off each other's strengths and weaknesses, each a perfect compliment to the other.  What makes all of these performances work, however, is that the actors themselves are as close as they are.  Making the Trilogy was such an intimate experience for the cast-the true friendships behind the characters shine through and are undeniable compliments to the script.Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn is simply breathtaking; it's hard to believe he was an ""accidental"" choice as this remarkable character.  Aragorn is the consummate leader, someone who is not arrogant or flamboyant, someone with humility and true heart.  Aragorn is strong and full of purpose, loyal and fearless.The same strong performances by the other actors that typified the last two installments are present in this film as well.  There is no one scene I can choose as a favorite.  The fight with Shelob is so stoked in adrenaline it leaves you breathless and shaking.  Billy Boyd has many fine scenes, one most notably in the presence of Denethor as he sings a poignant Hobbit folk song interspersed with scenes of Boromir rushing the enemy, a most certain suicide mission.  Every scene with Gandolf is a delight; Ian McKellen exudes a perfect balance between wisdom and companionship.  The sequence on Mount Doom is both breathtaking and heartbreaking...the screen belongs to Astin and Wood as we are reluctantly drawn into their realms: ""I am glad I'm with you Sam,"" Frodo says, ""Here at the end of all things.""There is too much to love about this movie to talk about in one review.  This film is poetry and music, war and redemption.  It is literally a return to the time of great filmmaking...a return to the silver screen of Hollywood's heyday.  It is the strongest of those classic films that purport the worthiness of the smaller person in all of us.  I suggest, obviously, that you see it.  Then see it again and again.  With each viewing you'll find something new to delight in, something else to appreciate when you least expect it.  ""Return of the King"" represents humanity at its best:  the triumph of love and camaraderie in troubled times.  ""All people for the greater good"" seems to be the central theme of this dazzling tale.  Lose yourself in this wonderful film, and take a little bit of its love with you each time you watch it."	5.0	Lord of the Rings: A Return to the Screen	2003-12-19	0	0	0

It's an absolutely amazing conclusion to a great movie trilogy. It won eleven Academy Awards including Best Picture and deserves all of them. Sean Astin should have won Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal as Sam Gamgee. It was the shining performance of this film. This movie is the most emotionally moving part of the trilogy. Some people complain about the multiple endings but i think they are necessary to wrap up all the story lines. The special features disc lacks the preview for the extended DVD and a music video.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ATOS750XCC9MQ	Classis Genre Film Fanatic	The Return of the King marks the end to the best trilogy ever made. Peter Jackson and his team got it right with the first two films, and they outdid themselves by combining the best elements of those films, multiplying them by 50, and putting them into this film for an incredible climactic ending to the trilogy. The story is the most emotional and human of the three films (although &quot;Fellowship&quot; comes close). The special effects and action sequences are the best in not only all three of these films, but of all time.What can I say about the DVD? Well first, the quality is absolutely stunning for the film. The picture is nice and crisp, with every color being as vibrant as it should be. The sound is once again in 5.1 Surround, so we get an awesome experience during the action sequences. Nothing was sacrificed in the quality of the film.I didn't give this DVD 5 stars simply because while the movie itself is a 5 star film, the special features aren't as good as the features on the theatrical version DVDs of the first two films, and those weren't even that great. They like to save all the good extra features for the extended cut DVD sets that come out during the holidays. Even so, the theatrical version DVDs of films 1 and 2 still had some special features that this one does not, and these specific features are what I looked forward to the most with these releases. With this DVD, there's no preview of it's corresponding extended cut coming out in December like there was for the first two films. And there's no Annie Lennox music video. The theatrical releases of the first two films on DVD had both previews of their extended cuts as well as a music video for the main theme song. This one does not. Plus, while the National Geographic documentary is informative and interesting, it was released as a single DVD when the film came out in theaters. So if you already bought that, then it's inclusion on this DVD isn't anything special.I did enjoy the first two documentaries on this DVD, although both repeat some of the same interviews and such. But there were things there that I've never seen before, and they were interesting.So if you only want to buy a Return of the King DVD with tons of unique special features, wait for the extended cut that comes out during the holiday season. You'll get an hour extra of footage added back into the film, plus two whole discs of special features. But, if you're like me, needing something to hold you over until the extended edition release, go ahead and cough up the $20 (or less) cost for this release if you plan to watch it again and again so that December doesn't seem that far away. :)	4.0	What a wonderful film...	2004-05-26	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1YWUPCT83WY48	"Claude Avary ""West Coast Reader"""	"It feels almost redundant to review ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."" How much promotion does this DVD need? The movie earned $1.1 billion worldwide in its initial release, the second highest-grossing film in history. It nabbed eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Critics raved about it. Audiences staggered out of the film in stunned amazement. Certainly, there are people didn't like it. Some viewers simply aren't interested in fantasy, and a small minority of J.R.R. Tolkien fans objected to the changes made to the original novel (I belong to the majority that believes the movies, despite alterations, remain extremely faithful to the source book). However, no film in my recent memory has garnered such strong love and adulation as ""The Return of the King."" It has become the great epic film event of its time, the same way that ""Star Wars"" was over thirty years ago. All effects films will now be measured against it. If you've seen it, chances are you loved or at least liked it and will want this DVD. If you haven't seen it, no time like the present...you'll have to see it eventually!For the buyer, however, a note of caution: an expanded special edition DVD set will hit shelves later this year. As with the releases of the previous installments in the trilogy, this second set will contain a longer version of the film (four hours in length) with two discs loaded with extras that total in excess of seven hours, plus four feature-length commentaries!By comparison, the DVD offered here is far slimmer: only two discs long, with `basic' extras and the theatrical version of the film (a bit over three hours). The documentaries are promotional pieces from TV, and don't have a lot of info in them because they were released before the film and kept many parts of it secret. (The National Geographic Special has already been available separately on DVD). The short featurettes are adequate and only whet your appetite for the expanded DVD release; there's not much hard data here. The inevitable ad for the videogame hardly counts as an `extra'. The six-minute ""Super Trailer"" for all three films is a pretty nice feature, however.For a casual viewer, this DVD should satisfy them. People who really loved the film might want to wait a few months and get the expanded edition instead. Tolkien lunatics like myself should get both. (I want to be able to watch the two different cuts separately, and if I don't have time to sit with friends and watch the four-hour version, we can watch the slimmer theatrical cut.) Whether you buy this DVD or the later one depends on how important ""The Return of the King"" is to you personally.The final third of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy of movies exceeded all expectations. Jackson took the most epic portion of the novel, with the final showdown between Sauron's forces of Mordor and the Men of Gondor, and Frodo and Sam closing in on the completion of their quest, and fashioned a film both magnificent in scope -- surpassing not only the previous two films but every film ever made -- and with deep emotions and wonderful characters. It's an astonishing feat that the biggest of the three films is the most touching and ""human."" Frodo's struggle against the Ring as he closes in on Mt. Doom unbearable torment, and his companion Sam (Sean Astin, in a role that should have received a Supporting Actor nomination) shows the greatest bravery and dedication of any character in the story. Every character gets his or her chance to shine, whether in a dramatic scene or a battle sequence.And the battles...nothing like them has ever been shown before. The initial strike on Minas Tirith, with catapult rocks decimating entire columns of orcs and flying Nazgul making vertigo-inducing dives onto the city, steals away one's breath. The climatic clash before Minas Tirith, with the Rohirrim battling a brigade of mumakil (titanic elephants), is the most sweeping battle scene ever put on screen. The technical effects are the best in cinema history, and they are all put in service of the story instead of existing to wow audiences, as happens in most popcorn summer flicks. The meld of drama, character, and technical achievement in ""The Return of the King"" is seamless; I doubt we will see the like of it again -- at least during the next decade.The most common complaint about the film is that it has ""too many endings."" I don't understand this criticism at all. After three full movies with these characters, it would be a cheat to abandon them without giving each one a special farewell. It would also let down the epic story, for this is a great tale that requires a large deal of wrapping up for it to work. For Tolkien fans, indeed, the ending feels too quick! (A major portion of the end of the novel, ""The Scouring of the Shire"" was not filmed because it would have dragged the ending on too long.) It's rare for a film today to let its characters stretch and resolve their stories correctly, and I commend Jackson for not cutting ""The Lord of the Rings"" short at the end in a hurry to `get it over with.' Savor this film to the end...it's a remarkable achievement.It's with some sadness that I face this DVD release, for it means that ""The Lord of the Rings"" movie trilogy is over, and there will be no highly anticipated, thrilling release coming this December. But I have the movie in my hands now, mine forever to cherish and re-watch whenever I want to relive the stunning experience.

Frodo is becoming sick and weary, all the while Sam tries to help him and the ring becomes heavier and tempts Frodo evermore.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AS14NV2O3HL1E	Clement Singarajah	Simply put the greatest movie ever made, for the greatest story every told - and that means better than the usual classics such as the Homer (not Homer Simpson for the illiterate), Tolstoy, Shakespeare, Dickens, Goethe and other long dead authors. Better than the Matrix, better than Star Wars, better than Titanic or Spiderman, The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Metropolis or Finding Nemo or Gone with the Wind or any other movie I have ever seen, which includes virtually all of the AFI top 100 films list.Movie making history has been made with this epic production.Yes there will be those who did not like this movie, usually those who have not bothered to use their brains and actually read it and are to quote &quot;regular cinemophiles&quot;. Tolkien himself accepted that many would find his novel boorish and to all those who quible and complain or did not like, you are entitled to your opinion and as the professor said,  I (and he) will probably detest the things you find enjoyable. Each to his own!For those who have read the novels, and the true Tolkien afficionados, the changes may be irritating but certainly reasonable bearing in mind this is a completely different medium to a novel. I believe most fans (which spans the gamut from teenagers, to doctors and scientists, churchmen and regular people, educated people, stupid and smart in varying degrees, religious or agnostic), will agree that the spirit of Tolkien lives on.Special effects are part of the story, not the story, the battles do not detract from the individual storyline. Courage and fortitude shine through, characaters show their frailty, they are scared, and desperate but they find it within themselves to go on. Despite knowing the novel intimately, I was captivated and felt every moment as if it was the first time.The themes are all there, beautifully portrayed by a cast that cared about their work as art and not just a quick job to the pay the bill. If you don't find yourself moved, it shows you are one of those that Tolkien referred to above.Those who criticise the endings, show the lack of appreciation of Tolkien's depth. To gain a victory some people pay a price and can never regain their former lives. Simple victories are what the massess want, more poignant moments are far from the usual Hollywood fare or mass market paperback.  Frodo paid for the victory, he can never be wholly healed of the scars. Sam's family is what they all fought for, the little people who as Frodo said &quot;all the stupid little hobbits.. but I love the Shire.. &quot; (a quote from the novel). They did not embark on this quest for personal power or fame, but for a higher ideal.The endings are perfect, as moving and bitter sweet as the novel.Soundtrack is stirring, complementing the movie superbly.Many spine tingling scenes abound: the last ride of Rohirrim, the pass of Cirith Ungol, Shelob's lair, Farimirs pain and courage, Frodo and Sam's struggles, the ring that eventually overcomes Frodo, Gollum's glee at getting his precious, sweeping shots of Minas Tirith and the battle of the Pelennor fields.Peter Jakson, the whole NZ crew and New Line cinema deserve a standing ovation for their vision in bringing the most popular story of at least the 20th Century if not all time, to the screen and in going the extra distance to make it nearly perfect.The othe Oscar Nominations for best movie are no where near as good, a well deserved victory for deep and moving stories.Hints of the special edition abound, scenes to come probably include Merry's pledge to King Theoden, Eomers anguish at his sister's apparent demise, the  Mouth of Sauron and probably a lot more.Favorite scene; the spine tingling prelude to King Theoden's last ride. &quot; Death!&quot; they scream and then they thundered forward to &quot;meet the doom of our time&quot;	5.0	Incomparably magnificent	2004-05-27	10	9	1

He sure matured as a filmmaker really quickly and Return of the King finds him combining everything into one great, but really long film.Concluding the Lord of the Rings trilogy: we find Sam and Frodo continuing their trek to Mount Doom with Gollum; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli going through an unorthodox method of getting help and the Hobbits being separated on 2 sides of a war. This will culminate in the massive Battle of Pelennor Fields as Frodo tries to destroy the One Ring while braving a massive creature.One complaint about the film is that it's quite length. It's always funny when people say the film's 3 and a 1/2 hours even though my clock said it was 3:10. I will say though that film does run long in parts, some of which unneedingly. Yeah we should care about the characters but when they go ""this upcoming battle is going to be dangerous"" than somebody else goes ""the next battle will need all the help we can get"" it seems kind of obvious. I have absolutely no issue with the ending actually; it ends the way it ought to. The only thing I didn't like was the fadeouts which made the false endings that much false.One thing that Jackson LOVES is his wide shots where the camera is extremely far away from the action, showing the scale and scope of the scene such as the big battle scene. Unfortunately it doesn't have the drama that it does when we're on the ground right in the thick of it. When you have 10,000 characters who are no bigger than a fingernail it's not as dramatic but when we go under Mumakils legs and dodging its feet we feel this is an intense battle. The CG is great in parts although the big crowd scenes look slightly too computer-y. Shelob however is marvelously done, looking creepy and menacing. And Gollum, while not a huge improvement, is still great. Not only that, he's in my favorite shot of the entire film: when we follow him alllll the way down when he falls off a cliff.If you want a nice big of epic fun, I very much recommend Return of the King but be forewarned it's long in parts and the Extended Edition is even moreso although it does have all the special features. After the disappointing Godfather and Matrix trilogy closers, it's great to finally watch one that's actually good."	5.0	Certainly way better than most trilogy enders	2006-04-09	2	1	1

Thankfully it never happened. Also Arwen at Helm's Deep never happened though they did film some horribly conceived minutes of it.(see TTT ex.ed. docs) These revisionist ideas can only be attributed to corporate greed. Someone at NL or AOL thought a final  one-to-one battle would rack up more bucks according to traditional hollywood formula. The LOTR fllms are in a class by themselves , possibly the greatest cinematic achievement of film ever. Luckily, Peter Jackson had enough clout by then to reject the idea based on the grounds that the idea had leaked and millions of book fans had protested on the internet. What hasn't been said enough, and most people realize by now even though many other fans of other genre's(Matrix Revolutions, Star wars prequels) who refused acknowlegment of LOTR's gold standard among all films, is that these films are simply among the best ever filmed of all time, not to mention a truly faithful adaptation of the epitome and progenitor of fantasy literature and LOTR is considered literature even to the point there are Cliff's Notes(cheat notes for high school) for the LOTR books.	5.0	Sauron vs. Aragorn concept???	2004-12-05	16	11	5

I'm siding with the reviewer who said it was ""profane"" and impossible.In Unfinished Tales Manwe asks Olorin (Gandalf) to be the third messenger to Middle Earth, as an answer to the reawakening of Sauron. Olorin was noted for being the wisest of all the Maiar, and he remarked that he was ""too weak for such a task, and that he feared Sauron."" Manwe said, essentially, that was all the more reason he should go. (Like the man who says he has not what it takes to be King - all the more reason for him to be King.) Most readers believe that Gandalf's fear of Sauron was tied into Sauron's relentless malice, not that Sauron was so much stronger than he. That his ""fear"" was the fear of wisdom, not of cowardice.Two pages later Tolkien writes, ""To the defeat of Sauron would [Manwe] not then send some...mighty spirit of the angelic people, one coeval and equal, doubtless, with Sauron in their beginnings, but not more? Olorin was his name.""Gandalf and Sauron shared the same beginnings, are from the same race, and are, as Tolkien notes, conteporaries and equals. When Gandalf slew the Balrog of Moria (also a member of the Maiar, twisted by Morgoth as was Sauron), he was, as the other reviewer noted, cleansed and sent back greater than he was. So much stronger that even Saruman's considerable strength (Saruman was also one of the Maiar, and the first chosen as ""messenger"" to Middle Earth upon the reawakening of Sauron.Now, the Witch King is not infused with Sauron's power. That is a direct misinterpretation of the character of the Witch King and the source of their power. All of the Nazgul were men of Numenor - and the men of Numenor were mightier than ""regular"" men. Sauron wooed them with rings of power, and brought them under his control.They derived much of their power from the rings they carried, not from Sauron - and this includes the Witch King.What must be remembered is that Gandalf himself - although it is not mentioned in the movie - bears one of the elven rings, Narya the Great, the Ring of Fire. Given that Gandalf bears a far greater ring than the Witch King, is of a greater ""race"", and has been cleansed and strengthened when he was already Sauron's near-equal, it is impossible to imagine that a mere human could have broken his staff."	5.0	Olorin/Gandalf and the Witch King	2004-12-15	13	11	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AL6JH1MR37Z25	"CNJ ""eebooks"""	"As usual, the scenery was gorgeous, esp. the mountainous areas, but the characters were shallow and much of the acting was either mediocre or hollow.  The film was still was also very male-dominated.It was mostly hyped-up, medieval battle after battle with the same tripe on horses and bows and arrows in this film that advertised itself as a fantasy film. But there is really little fantasy or magic at all and the plot is shallow and lacks the depth and emotion that the Harry Potter films have.The closer Frodo gets to Mordor, the more he becomes a complete dodo, esp. over the ring.  I had to laugh out loud when Frodo keeps Sam from getting on Gullom, who is after the ring.Sam is one character who improved over the first two films; the actor did a better job this time around with Sam and Sam showed some promise here; after Frodo hurts his feelings so nastily and acts stupid, Sam courageously comes to Frodo's rescue when Gullom tricks Frodo into a trap.Throughout the film, Sam also tries to warn Frodo that Gullom is up to no good and is trying to deceive both of them, but Frodo, who is also exploiting Gullom, just coolly brushes Sam's fears off. Frodo was also very insensitive and showed a lack of loyalty in allowing Gullom to mock Sam and badmouth him.I felt so sorry for poor Sam when Frodo turns on him and sends Sam away in tears and it's revealed that Frodo has just been using Sam all along.  Frodo should be thanking his lucky stars that he has Sam for a friend; few friends would come to aid the way Sam did. I get the feeling Frodo doesn't fully appreciate Sam's friendship.Gullom was funny in many parts; his self-mumblings made me laugh; other times, he was downright mean, esp. to Sam and I'd have been irritated enough to tell him to get lost.  Gullom is the brains of the threesome and knows that Frodo is using him and resents it, but realized that Frodo isn't too bright, so he devises his trap after Frodo falls for his lies about Sam.  In that way, Gullom uses Frodo and Sam, although Frodo is too dull to realize it.I also laughed at some of the scenes with Gandalf, Merry, and Pippin; poor Pippin rather naively looked thru Gandalf's ball and gets into trouble with Gandalf, who, despite his ""wizardly"" demeaner of being a ""gentle"" old man, really doesn't have much patience with the hobbits and isn't as deep or caring as Hogwart's Dumbledore is.If anything, I watched this one for a lot of laughs and spoof ideas, despite the film's attempt at being a serious war film.  It's good fodder for comedians and spoofs."	2.0	Scenery lovely, buuut...	2004-10-21	23	2	21

Zachary ""Thematic Score Aficionado"""	RETURN OF THE KINGTheatrical Version ReviewAlthough the cinematic achievement of the theatrical version of `The Lord ofthe Rings: The Return of the King' may be considered unparalleled in the genreof epic fantasy, there are problems with the film.  Arguably, there are fourmajor areas where I feel there could be improvements.1.) The Smeagol flashback opening runs a bit too long, and could be trimmed toone half of its length.  The Edoras Victory Party could also be cut in half.Streamlining the first twenty minutes of the film would leave room for theDeath of Saruman, a necessity considering the evil wizard's stature in thefirst two films.2.) Denethor's ownership of a palantir and his obsession with using this seeingstone would explain his madness more fully.  A short scene revealing this factonce again develops Denethor's character better than the film's simplistic useof grief alone.3.) The absence of the Orc Chieftain Quasimodo's death scene as well as theface-off between Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgul are both glaringomissions.  The over-expanded Arwen story could have been trimmed to includethese two necessary story closures that would have greatly improved the film.4.) The House of Healing scene is compulsory for two reasons.  The hospitalsequence establishes the blossoming romance between Eowyn and Faramir as wellas revealing the healing powers of Aragorn.  The omission of this scene is yet anotherpoetic jewel left out of the Lord of the Rings' cinematic crown.Again, my affection for this trilogy soars even though I feel the critiqueabove illuminates the editorial errors in bringing the great epic to the silverscreen. I eagerly await the Extended Edition that surely includes some of thesescenes.	4.0	Four Improvements	2004-03-19	40	23	17

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1XYFI8215KTF6	Colleen Chen	When I saw ROTK in the theater I was disappointed--several of the scenes really seemed to drag on.  I felt that they had too many pans of the pig-faced Orc and then way too much of crying Hobbits at the end.  The battles stretched on into infinitesimal sameness.  Overall, I felt that they could have cut a half hour from the movie and it would have benefited.However, once I saw the extended version I completely changed my mind!  Suddenly, with the extra scenes all the holes were filled in and the lengthy battles and long goodbyes fit much better in that context.  I could better see how the pieces fit together.  And it was beautiful, a masterpiece!  I've now watched the whole thing over 15 times through.And I don't know if anyone's mentioned that with the Platinum Series Gift Set you get this really great little model of Minas Tirith and you can look at it while it's being attacked on the screen in front of you.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A6YPIO7EWMLI6	Colombo	"I would give this movie 10 stars if i could, but since this is about the Extended Edition, i'd like to say that the extra scenes are great, especially the part with saruman. the end of that scene is almost exactly like the end of the Scouring of the Shire, except that it takes place at orthanc, and Gandalf is there.That being said, i'd like to mention one part that makes me hate Peter Jackson with a passion for about 3 mintues: Gandalf's confontation with the witch-king of Angmar. For those of you who have seen it, the witch-king intercepts Gandalf, says a few words, erupts his sword into flame, then breaks Gandalf's staff, throwing Gandalf off his horse, onto the ground.To me, that is a total degradation of Gandalf's character.1) Gandalf is more powerful than the witch-king, period.2) Gandalf fought and killed a BALROG (also more powerful than the witch-king) when he was gandalf the GREY. he was sent back as gandalf the WHITE, more powerful than he was.so why would the witch-king, a MAN with minimal power, be able to  break GANDALF THE WHITE's STAFF, and throw him onto the ground, cowering like a little kid???and if u watch the regular cut closely, you can see that Jackson was alluding to this part through whole movie. Gandalf explains to Pippin about the Witchking, clearly showing some type of fear. The witch-king also tells Gothmog, when asked about ""the wizard"", ""I will break him"".If Peter Jackson felt he had to give Gandalf some type of nemesis from Mordor, i'm fine with the witch-king being that character. But I'm not fine with the fact that Jackson made the WitchKing so much more powerful. It just wouldn't happen. If anyone has explanations, please tell....no wonder that part was cut."	5.0	FANTASTIC...except for one part	2005-11-19	15	11	4
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3DTUMLBZCG47D	Connor J. Hamilton	The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers were both superb films, and The Return of the King is a satisfactory end to this wonderful trilogy that has become probably the best three films ever made in the history of cinema.With events escalating toward a final Gondor/Mordor showdown and Frodo and Sam toiling through Mordor, the epic scope of this film is obviously tremendous, but Peter Jackson handles this with what seems like effortless skill.This movie has three minor flaws-the beginning, the end, and Arwen Evenstar. Since few people would be coming into the third movie of a trilogy without having seen the other two movies, it seems a bit redundant to give the audience Smeagol's degeneration into Gollum all over again at the beginning of the film. The scene is a little bit long, too, and the film could have just started off where that scene ends-Frodo and Sam just outside of Mordor on their quest to destroy the Ring. This is just where The Two Towers left off, so it would be a very natural starting point.Arwen-why does Peter Jackson think everybody likes her so much? I certain don't. Liv Tyler's breathy, overly dramatized performance gets on my nerves quite a bit, and since she was hardly in the books at all, I think Jackson would have made a good move by just not putting her in there nearly as much as she was. Lord of the Rings is about self-sacrifice and a desperate war of self-defense. It's not a love story.The end has nothing inherently bad in it in the least-it's just too drawn out. I fully realize that Jackson is doing what he can with the material in the book-which was obviously quite a bit more extensive-but it just seems a little anticlimactic to the tight, excellently-done action that's come before it.Now to the rest of the film, which is uniformly excellent. All of the actors are good, and Elijah Wood and Sean Astin in particular give thrilling performances. Wood's portrayal of Frodo's slow degeneration from the power of the Ring is awesome, and Astin's performance as the tremendously self-sacrificial Sam is quite touching.Most of the beginning of the movie is taken up by anticipation of and/or preparation for Sauron's massive attack on Minas Tirith, and the progressively more difficult journey of Frodo and Sam.Then after that things start getting darker. First of all, there's Gollum luring Frodo into the cave of the hideous spider Shelob. This is a chillingly suspenseful sequence, with Shelob looming out of the darkness of her cave, and Frodo getting stuck in her sticky webs. It's hard to believe that Shelob is completely digital-hats off to the computer graphics team for a great job.And then, of course, just when you think Frodo has gotten free from her cave, those creepy long legs come out of a crack in the ground...Weaving in and out of Frodo and Sam's journey is Mordor's great hammer stroke against Minas Tirith. With 200,000 orcs spread out across the field in front of the city, complete with trolls, siege towers, a massive battering ram, and the Nazgul on flying steeds swirling above the walls, you really can't go wrong when you mix this with Peter Jackson's directing. I loved the part where Minas Tirith lobs pieces of its own stone back at the orcs below-especially when the camera actually follows one of the rocks down to the ground. All of this entire battle sequence is awesome...especially when the Rohirrim come over the crest of a hill with the rising of the sun. Listening to King Theoden encouraging his troops and then seeing the riders of Rohan plunging onward to rescue their allies-you can't really get much better than this.One might think that after one tremendous battle, Peter Jackson is finally done with sword-swinging action and flying arrows. But he's not. There's another combat to come right before the Black Gates, initiated by the powers of good expressly to give Frodo and Sam a chance to get across Mordor alive. This battle is like the other ones-well done and realistic. But it may have the most importance of any of them, since this is pretty much the last troops the good guys have, and Frodo had better do his job, or they'll be obliterated.The final scene in the Cracks of Doom is incredible...so I won't reveal anything. It's just plain awesome, and this movie is an absolute must-see. Don't miss it.	5.0	Incredible film--definitely watch it!	2004-02-05	1	1	0

Jackson does a fantastic job with his shooting here, magnificent camera angles, lighting, sound, it all falls into place here. And as for the actors, everyone is at the top of their game, even Elijah Wood (though that is debateable).

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A39LRLKACX89IP	Courtland J. Carpenter	"Yes, there are some parts missing, some (such as the final battle of the wizards) are rumored to be saved for the DVD. Still, this is a great movie, and the focus was meant to be on the hobbits, and it was. One of the most difficult things to do in these movies, was to make them have some semblance of being self-contained. Yes, movies like Star Wars original trilogy managed it, but those stories were created to be broken down in that manner. In fact, the final part of that trilogy, The Return of the Jedi, was little more than a redo of the first film, but with the head baddies killed off.LOTR is a true trilogy; each part builds upon each other, until the epic finish.  It contains all 12 parts of the classic ""heroes journey"", in a depth and detail rarely seen in modern literature.  The movies captured this in a way most of us, would not have thought possible.  The special effects of this movie blended seamlessly with the live action, to create an experience, like none I've ever felt before.  The only missing elements, which I can only hope was filmed, to be later restored on the DVD, were the wizards battle, and the 11th element of the ""heroes journey"" called the ""resurrection"".  This was the part in Tolkien's book where the hobbits returned to the ""Shire"". They found it corrupted, taken over by ruffians, who were led by the evil Saruman, and Wormtongue.  Unlike the time before, when they first departed on this great adventure, they were now seasoned, savvy fighters. They could now overcome this great evil, without the help of Gandolph and the others.The movie skipped that element, and went right to the ""return with the elixir"" part. This is where they all said their goodbyes as the elves sailed away to whatever. (Maybe to bake cookies in a hollow tree!) In the movie, even this part added, probably made the film a bit long, but at least it gave the viewer a chance to wind down.  I bought the first two movies in the simple, inexpensive packaging.  I'm going to guess that this one comes out in some sort of ultimate collectors edition. It will appear as a box set, that includes all three movies, and which should be well worth getting.This movie was somewhat better than the middle in the trilogy, as the characters stood out this time, over the still spectacular, action sequences. Perhaps it was easier to make this evident, as there were ample opportunities.  The madness of the temporary ruler of Gondor, the battle with the ""witch king"", the ""ring bearers"" hardships, the reforging of the ""kings sword"", and many other great moments. If you missed it on the big screen, try at least to catch it on a big TV.  Despite the worldwide billion plus dollars these three movies have pulled in, I sincerely doubt we shall ever see anything done in this grand a scale again anytime soon. At least I wouldn't expect to see it again in my lifetime! It will be a crime not to hand out some Oscars, for this last in the great LOTR series!

I know what many people are thinking, that these movies are a sad recreation Tolkin's outstanding novels. And I think that you have a small point. Now before you hate me LOTR fans I will have you know that I loved the movies. But it is true, the movies in No way can compare to the novels, they lack in detail and they did not follow the story line very well. But everyone must understand there are curtian things that had to be cut out of the movies or changed; and another thing wake up and realize:PETTER JACKSON IS NOT TOLKIN!From what I have heard many of you spend your time comparing the movies to the books instead of really ""WATCHING"" the movies. Yes some of the special effects in the 3rd movie are a little... dissapointing, but the movies really are five star deserving. I know everyone has different views on such things, but Petter Jackson did do a great job.The books would be imposible to make into movies with out having to alter things. And also realize how you read the books and inturpeted them is NOT how everyone else saw them. Everyone got different thing out of the book. So before you go around saying the movies sucked because the weren't like the books realize that they are from different peoples views, and that movies can not be 100% like the books.I reccomend ""The Return Of The King"", to people who are willing to appreciate the movies for what the are; and also to those who where dissapointed by the comparison of the 1st and 2nd movies vs. the books, I think you should whatch the 3rd movie as if there was no book, and maybe then you will see Jackson did a great job!Well see you guys at the movies on December 17, 2003!!!"	5.0	Petter Jackson, is not JRR Tolkin... in a good way...	2003-12-07	16	6	10

Phan ""Fincoon"""	The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition Collector's Gift Set) is a must have for all LOTR fans.This edition has well over 50-minutes of extended scenes that are worth watching.  I really enjoy the highly-detailed bust of Minas Tirith that came with the box because it is well-designed and very detailed.  Another of my favorites from the collection is the Howard Shore Symphony DVD exclusive that shows the music performed live in a symphony.  Yet another good addition to my LOTR soundtrack collection.Extended scenes that I like are the last confrontation with Saruman and more story-telling of Faramir and Denethor.  The battle sequence is somewhat longer because more uncut scenes were added, and they really enhance the battle at Pelenor Fields.  I love it.Those who complained about the movie does not know what Hollywood and Movie-making is all about.  Peter Jackson did an outstanding job at directing the movie in every aspect.  He did many alterations to the scene and events from the book, but it was appropriate for the flow of the movie.  I believe Peter did a wonderful job at keeping up with Tolkein's work.I myself have read Tolkein's LOTR trilogy, and I have to agree that it surpasses Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy by far.  Still, I believe movies are just movies and must take in consideration that the purpose of movies is for entertainment.	5.0	Extraordinary and Outstanding!!  ASIN: B000634DCC	2004-12-18	1	1	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	"First of all, let me just say how impressed I was with the first two movies in this trilogy. They were outstanding films and deserving of all the awards they received. Perhaps that is one reason I was so disappointed in this movie; it wasn't nearly as interesting as the first two. The main reason can be summed up in my headline here.Director Peter Jackson made the same mistake he made in the film he did right after this one: ""King Kong,"" where the action was way too much, too the point of ludicrousness and an insult to viewers' intelligence. So was this film, the third in the LOTR series.It was too much action, so much that after halfway through this 3 hour, 20-minute movie I was numb and could care less what happened from that point. I stuck with it, but, overall, it committed the worst sin of them all for fantasy-adventure movie - it got boring. Too much violence translates into ""boring."""	2.0	Two Words: Overkill & Excessive	2007-09-17	8	5	3
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"The third Lord of the Rings film is better than the first two, and is a joy to watch.  It somehow manages to avoid the mistakes of the previous two films and, in fact, succeeds despite the errors inherited from the first two that could easily have sunk it.  Peter Jackson's mistake in the Lord of the Rings trilogy was to try to include too much of the books.  In Fellowship, for example, the crossing of the Pass at Carhadras should have been cut.  In Two Towers, the Battle of Helm's Deep, while impressive, does nothing to advance the story.  Because of these slow-downs, something like 1/4 of Two Towers had not been told yet - and they were essential parts of Frodo and Sam's journey into Mordor.Fortunately, Return of the King is a smooth and simple story.  Only 3 things happen: 1. The Battle of Pelennor Fields, where the men and orcs fight it out for control of Minas Tirith. 2. Aragorn, Eomer, and Gandalf lead an army into Mordor to distract Sauron from ... 3. Sam and Frodo trying to get to Mount Doom to destroy the ring.  There are no side battles.  There are no extraneous dream sequences that don't even appear in the book.  Extra characters are ruthlessly cut.  If Jackson does allow the end to spin out for far too long - the departure of the Elves from Middle Earth is irrelevant to the main story and is probably confusing to the casual viewer - he is still better than Tolkien himself.  Jackson heroically manages to cut most of the last 100 pages of Tolkien's narrative that added little to the main story.Because the same care and attention to detail is brought to this film that were brought to the first two, and because the script is better, the film transcends its genre into greatness (and was appropriately awarded 11 Academy Awards, only half of which were in technical categories).  The Battle of Pelennor Fields is possibly the single greatest cinematic achievement since the beginning of the CGI era (including Star Wars Ep. III).  Seamlessly combining 150 live horses and riders with 6000 computer-generated ones would be difficult enough, but the addition of the completely computer-generated Oiphants in Sauron's army was a recipe for potential disaster.  Instead, the sequence is exciting, immersing, and even ""realistic."" (I know, as does every calvary rider since Alexander, that real horses won't run over people, but maybe Middle Earth horses behave differently - the sound and visual effects totally sell the realism of the battle.)Jackson effectively keeps alive the Frodo/Sam storyline, which could have been very dull.  But their personal battles (Sam's with Shelob - one of the leftovers from Two Towers), Frodo's capture by Orcs, Frodo's fight with Gollum) are small and contrast nicely with the big doings of Aragorn's armies.  Through all the action, the humanity of the characters still shines through (as Tolkien would require).  The actors are universally good - inspiring, overawed, and moving as required.  The effects are outstanding, the sound editing seamless, and the musical score very effective (without the cloying melodies that plagued Two Towers).  If the undead Oathbreakers look similar to the Pirates of the Caribbean, it's purely coincidence.Fans of the book will naturally bemoan some omissions and reinterpretations - especially among fan favourite characters.  Wormtongue's end comes in the first reel, not in the last pages of the book.  The sons of Elrond are absent, as are the Dunedain, as are the Woses (the Wild Men of Rohan).  The entire subplot of ambitious and unscrupulous Hobbits taking over Bag End and Hobbiton was similarly cut.  Gollum's fate is altered (although Jackson is right - the way it's described in the book is unfilmable).  All these changes are necessary - to include them would only have added to the already overlarge cast of characters (it was already difficult enough to keep Faramir and Eomer straight!).  I, for one, have never forgiven Jackson for cutting the Barrow Wights from the first film, but certain sacrifices had to be made, and these cuts are all logical in the final analysis of the film as a stand-alone piece.  Again, Jackson could have cut more - especially the departure of the Elves, as I mentioned above - but overall the excess amounts to little more than 15 minutes out of the 4-hour running time of this special-edition cut.The extras are, as with the previous two Special Edition DVD's, very thorough and enjoyable to watch.  There is virtually no overlap within the special features for this film, nor between the special features of this film and those previous.  There is some repetition between the special features and the audio commentaries, but you can hardly count that - there are 4 commentaries and the people have to talk about something for the 4 hours!  Certainly, this DVD box set is worth the cost, both for the film itself and the myriad special features."	5.0	By far the best of the trilogy	2005-08-14	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"For me, this is the best of the three movies.  It brings everything together and is the climax of the story.  The battles are absolutely breathtaking visually and do have touches of humor to break the relentless fury of the battles.  For example, after Legolas has done an amazing attack on one of the marauding giant elephants with the dozens of soldiers riding it with a 10.0 dismount, Gimli says, ""It still only counts as ONE!"" and off they go to more fighting.When I read the book I was most touched by the scene where Frodo and Sam and just about finished on the slopes of Mount Doom and Sam says, ""I may not be able to carry the ring for you, Mr. Frodo, but I can carry you!""  He rousts his last reserves of strength and carries Frodo to their fate.  The movie was just as I had imagined it and I wish Sean Astin would have won every acting award for his portrayal of my favorite character in the trilogy.The entire trilogy is a gift to all of us.  Yes, the books should be read and there is more there than in any movie could ever portray.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2JUMQUP5OBQWA	"CSH ""CSH"""	I initially vowed not to watch this movie. The second had me so offended by everything that Peter Jackson had embellished, and truth to tell, I nearly walked out on the Fellowship of the Ring during the Rivendell sequence. The reason for this is I could give an hour long synopsis of the history and story of Middle-Earth ten years after I was dead, or so it seems, and I have memorized longer passages of the Lord of the Rings than I have of the Bible. (Yes, that is tragic.) That tells you how much of a geek I was.It should also tell you how much I know of the story, and how important precision is to me, when we are talking of the Lord of the Rings. I hated the whole men-are-weak theme that was in this story from the first of Peter Jackson's films, nor did I care for the manifold other changes that the two movies preceding this one had, and I was, I admit, very angry at the end of the Two Towers, so angry that I decided not to watch this movie, and I will not purchase the Two Towers. After all, I know how the story ends.This oath to myself, chiefly made to keep me from spending another seven dollars just to get angry, set off a long debate in my mind, a debate that also occurred in my circle of friends and family who have read the books/would be interested in this kind of movie. Their vote was unanimous: see the movie, they said. Yet the debate continued until this very week when I finally relented.I am glad I did. This was the truest of all three films, and the dialogue was perfect, every signicant line being derived in one fashion or another from the books. The most drastic change from the written work was how the Paths of the Dead sequence was done in the film, and that change was easily forgiven. As I said of the first film, the film was editted for integrity, and this film was more so than the other two combined. Not to say that there were no differences between Peter Jackson's film and the written work, but they were forgivable, and none of the scenes were completely fabricated, or ripped out of the Hobbit, as I felt several scenes were in the second film, or changed excessively, unnecessarily, or counterproductively, as I felt several scenes had been in the first.The best thing about this production, though, was the goal. For all his embellishments, Peter Jackson did not commit the travesty of trying to do anything different with the ending, nor did he try to add some message to it that was his own and not the intention of Pr. Tolkien. John Huston could not resist doing that with the made for television version released in 1980, and that production was just horrid. This production ended just exactly as it should have, and Peter Jackson's attention to detail was such that the last line of the film was the last line of the book. The entire movie was that true to the story, and Peter Jackson was entirely consistent with how he told it, meaning that he never contradicted himself. Four things only did I note about this production, and only people who have studied this series as much as I have would have even noticed (some of) them. First, the scene inside Mount Doom, once they reached it, was lengthened just a bit for dramatic effect. Secondly, the last time Frodo dons the Ring, he puts it on the wrong finger. Thirdly, the final conversation on Mount Doom's slopes makes no mention of Gollum. Finally, the Elvenship mentioned at the end is called the very last elvenship. Still, none of these detract from the story itself and I only mention them because to me they were incredibly obvious. After the second film, I had passed a death sentence on any possibility of watching the third, but the Lord High Executioner granted a pardon, and was not disappointed.

See, when you actually have read Tolkien's books, you have a much better understanding of what's going on, and a much greater appreciation for what Jackson has managed to do with the series in general, but also this movie in particular.I'd also like to respond to a few other people's comments, for example: ""It doesn't tell us about what happens to Legolas, Gimli, Faramir, Eowyn, Eomer (who deserved more screen time) and others."" Hmm...could that be because Tolkien never mentioned it? Could it be because the story starts and ends with hobbits and the Shire? I mean, use your brains, people. As for minor characters, like the ""squishy faced Orc"" and the ""hell raiser/mad max dude that's leading the Oliphant soldiers."" Do you know why they're not introduced? Because they don't need introduction. They're only important because they are in charge of, respectively, an Orc army and a huge Oliphaunt. They are faceless and nameless, that's why they're not introduced.In conclusion, I'd like to say that I am a HUGE fan of Tolkien's books, they are my favorite books ever, and I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It certainly beat out other movies almost as anticipated, like Matrix Revolutions."	5.0	Puh-LEEZ, people	2003-12-21	12	8	4

Thomas ""Wanna be Critic"""	I was one of the early critics of ROTK because the film seemed disjointed in the theater-although I still generally liked the movie then.  However after watching the extended editon everything makes so much more sense.  I mean some serious scenes were cut out of the theatrical production-my new personal favorite of the new scenes takes place initially at the gates of mordor when Aragorn, and company ride up to call out Sauron.If you do buy this DVD, and you should, be prepared to spend about 5hrs with this one(including a couple of short breaks).  Very very long, but well worth it because it got almost everything from the original Tolkien novel here.  This film is a winner on so many levels for the breadth of detail Peter Jackson incorporates into this film.If $30 is not an issue, definitely trade-up to this one-even if you own the original version of ROTK-you wont regret it.	5.0	Fantastic Film	2004-12-16	5	5	0

Tolley ""Chris Tolley"""	After enduring a year's worth of waiting, I have finally seen the extended cut. Oh, my. If you are one of the few who couldn't stand to sit through the theatrical cut for its length, this is not for you. If how long a movie runs isn't that important, read on. As the extra scenes have already been pointed out and dissected by many others, let me just say that many scenes really weren't that vital to the story, but helped it tremendously. The scene at Isengard with Saruman and Wormtongue alone is worth getting this set for. The new and enhanced scenes add depth and development to several charactors, and help explain a few scenes from the theatrical cut that didn't make too much sense at the time. As for leaving some things out or unfilmed, (the scouring of the shire, for example)this is Peter Jackson's adaptation, and his call to edit or film as he wished. I believe he did a top-notch job with extremely difficult source material, and was richly deserving of the accolades that came his way as a result. The film was deeply moving, dark, and terrifying. Happy in completion of the quest, melancholy at the cost of victory. To me, a favorite scene is near the end, with the four hobbits back home, at the inn. Sharing mugs of beer, looking at all the gaiety about them, unable to join it, due to the fact they themselves are forever changed. When viewed in sequence with the other extended cut films in the trilogy, The Return of the King is extremely emotional, thrilling, and heart rending. I truly believe this trilogy to be the greatest ever filmed, and likely not to be topped, even in top-heavy Hollywood.	5.0	Brilliant Finish to Brilliant Trilogy	2004-12-20	12	10	2

No less than the redemption of humankind.  Indeed, we do live in what is almost the day of the Orc.  Is our world today that much less a hell than the burning plains of Mordor where the all-seeing eye of Sauron ever torments?Inevitably, the overwhelming threat of doom (which we in fear, and greed, and obsessive heartlessness of a Gollum or any other maker of Evil have created) will have to be faced.  Probably, in this generation or the next, the climactic battle will occur.For this reason, if not for many others, this film demands to be seen.  Do you share enough in the vision of peace, the humility of the Shire, the courage of Aragon, to allign with the forces of Good?  For not the armies of the dead shall claim this victory, but those of the living.For over four decades people attempted to covert Tolkien's masterpiece into the great cinema which we all knew it could be.

First, the special effects in the movie are astounding, yet not overwhelming. Realism is key here, and the movie accomplishes this without question. Second, the &quot;hope&quot; that no one purchases this movie just speaks of bias. Anyone worth their salt would give opinion and allow others to form their own by viewing this movie. Unlike perhaps the Matrix series, in which the latter two movies are mere shadows of the first, this concludes the series with consistency and, again, accuracy to the tale.That being said, I agree with other viewers that this is a fitting and incredible end to our journey through an intense and accurate depiction of the books through film.

Runyan is absolutely correct that this chapter is the real climax of the novels:  the whole point of LOTR is that it's fundamentally a story told by and through the eyes of the Hobbits (identified with Tolkien's English countrymen but really symbolizing the average person everywhere).  It's all well and good that the great heroes of the world -- Gandalf, Aragorn, Elrond -- can win mighty battles; but the important thing is that the real heroes are the common folk... Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry, and in the Hobbit, Bilbo.  Tolkien understood that the real victory is that the Hobbits learn that their destiny is in their own hands, which the Scouring of the Shire chapter makes crystal clear.Alas, P. Runyan (and I) are destined for disappointment, as Peter Jackson stated in an interview that he did not even film that section.  It seems that he never understood the point of it; he thought it a huge ANTI-climax, because he just never got it.So it's very unlikely to be in the Platinum Edition, as that would require reconstructing the Shire sets (rebuilding an entire village) and going back into principle photography just for the DVD, which all the die-hard LOTR fans will buy anyway even without the scouring.If it's there, I'll be utterly shocked and delighted.

So much has already been said about it that I won't belabor it except to say that visually, dramatically and musically -perfect.  It is dramatic and moving, just as it ought to be, and in all the right places.  Sam's fight with Shelob is actually scarier than in the book, and the final confrontation between Gollum and Frodo is even better than Tolkien portrayed it, hard as that is to imagine.  If any quibbles can be made, I think the fans universally disliked the elimination of Saruman and Wormtongue so early in the story, and Faramir still comes across as a weak shadow of his older brother.  As for Denethor, the movie never once explains why he is the sort of man he is, driven to despair and despiration because Sauron has been lying to him for years through a second palantir.  The battle for the Shire is absent, but that too was one of the many sacrifices made for dramatic purposes.To portray the stories exactly as written, even 12 hours is far too short.  A 30-hour mini-series would have been necessary, and that is highly unlikely.All things taken into consideration, the ""Lord of the Rings"" series is one of the finest movies or series of movies ever made. They have wonthe hearts of a generation, they are stories of friendship, hope, love and salvation.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	APHRSI8S66Y2D	D. Albinson	"I have just returned from LOTR ROTK. It's almost 5 am here but wanted to write a quick note for all those planning on seeing it tomorrow that are still scouting reviews. It seems there is almost 100 reviews and I only found one in the first half from someone saying they have seen it so maybe my 2 cents will help. :)They did it justice. Rich without being crass and impressive without crossing the line, ROTK is the year's best trilogy ending and quite possibly one of the best action movies in years. I believe the visuals and the direction bring to life not only the pages of the infamous series but also the brilliant mind of Tolkien. On the negative side, some may say it is long, and they are correct. THough I didnt see more than a mere two or three squimish in the theatre. I do think that the editing that was done for theatre viewing slightly  cheapened the story, with the post-climax scenes occasionally seemed to be trivialized. A couple times it seemed like it was over, fade to black or fade to white and then a couple seconds later another scene opens! This was funny watching the people get up and then sit back down...only to get up and sit down again a minute later! This ""is it over now"" technique did make it seem that ending scenes were included mainly for the diehard book-to-screen translation fans. Typical American action movies end within a minute or two of the final battle, often zooming out of the end battleground to credits. The fact that they did it differently does show in one more way how this is not your typical action flick. It also illustrates something else interesting...this film's brand of humor. That brings us to the top three things I could think of on the way home. WHy I think they did it better than many other past franchise installments. One, they kept it serious. Screenwriters didnt interfere and find the need to pen in comic relief. Very few cheesy one liners. No Jar Jar Binks. Many people have a preconceived notion that scifi/fantasy is child's subjects and adding content in for comedy often just reinforces that. Two there was a low level of fake looking scenes. Scenes where you say ""is that as good as they could do?"". Scenes like the windgliding the wave post avalanche in Die Another Day or similar scenes in the Mummy Returns. Third, they didnt blatantly leave it open for a sequel. It ends where a sequel would not be impossible, but there still is closure. I don't put it past Hollywood to leave good enough alone anymore and wanting to try to hook you for another round should the numbers look good, you know?In summary, There was times when my mouth was hanging open (and not for popcorn either)!  You will be highly entertained, more in the second half I'd say without having ever heard of a hobbit. Though you'd really enjoy it if you watched 1 and 2 first. There is evidence of enthusiasm and ambition for the project everwhere, and combined with a great entertainment value (almost 3 hours long) equals an uncommon cinema experience for the whole family. (Compare to Men In Black II...expensive to make and only 80 min. if u count the  credits...lol) My hats off to Mr Jackson and his entire team. They brought something previously seen only in the imagination to the big screen for all to see. They did it justice. Enjoy!"	5.0	It Does Justice!	2003-12-17	4	4	0

In all my 600 DVD collection, the three extended versions of LOTR are the most treasured, occupy the top shelf of the first DVD rack. There's a reason for that. Best experienced in DTS with a high end sound system. No need to review the content, as by now unless you are an isolated amazonian tribe in Brazil you have already read the accounts of these films.One comment I must make, I dont get too emotional very often from film moments, but the moment where Aragorn , after being crowned King of all Men, tells Frodo and his hobbit companions that they bow to no one chokes me up, and Ive seen it 3 times already. That moment crystalizes the entire 3 film package for me, all the emotions I feel when watching the films come to a head at that moment. Its the single most spectacular, emotional, meaningful moment in any film of any genre I have ever experienced. Thank you Peter Jackson and thank you LOTR cast.If by some reason you have been living under a rock, DO NOT PASS GO, DO NOT COLLECT $200, DO ORDER THIS DVD IMMEDIATELY.I can think of no better way to spend 25 bucks.	5.0	Is there any better way to spend 12 hours?	2004-12-27	8	7	1

To actually think that this is a rip off on Star Wars just goes to show how backwards his thinking is. If anything Star Wars is rip off on the Lord of the Rings. I mean you do know that it was a book written 40 years ago. And of course you have to have watched all the movies to understand the movie. Thats how the book was written. It was pretty much written as one giant book. And the effects were top notch. To have that many shots in a movie takes a lot of work.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2RUFILQXWXTEI	"Daniel J. Smitherman ""phenomenologist"""	"In one of the special features, Tom Shippey shares his thoughts on Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, and the movies. Mr. Shippey wrote ""J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century"" and ""The Road To Middle Earth."" In the interviews for the special feature, Mr. Shippey said he thought that there were now two equal ways to access Tolkien's work: through the books, and through the movies.I agree with Mr. Shippey. I read the books for the first time in 1977 at the age of 16; I read them several times more over the years. I read them out loud to my daughter as she grew up. The end of The Return of the King has always moved me deeply, especially the sense of loss as the hobbits return to Hobbiton, and for Frodo especially, it isn't the same as when he left. The scene at the Grey Havens has always moved me to tears. The movie did just the same, and in the same way as the book.As in the first two movies, Peter Jackson has stayed close to the spirit and the letter of Tolkien's written work. I reread ""The Grey Havens"" last night, and some of the most important dialogue is taken directly from Tolkien himself. The special feature interviews relating to Tolkien himself are a such a nice addition - focusing on the man who made these movies possible.Again, too, I am moved by Peter Jackson's own passion and devotion to the story. The degree of detail and care is evident in stray shots and trivial costume matters - which are clearly not trivial to all who were involved in creating these films.Return of the King continues the excellence and passion of Jackson's work in the previous films, and stays true to Tolkien's work."	5.0	Aching in the Passing	2005-02-21	10	9	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A13RM1AWD1C5ZR	Daniel K.	"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a wonderful final installment to the ""Rings"" trilogy.  It featuresgreat epic battle sequences, nice acting and an great story (which is rare in movies now a days).  Director Peter Jackson makes the environment of Middle Earth so real and miraculous along with the dazzling special effects, and Gollum-Smegal (Andy Serkis) is the one in this movie who just about steals the show.  Sir Ian Mckellen is excellent as Gandalf (as always) along with the rest of the great dynamic cast.The journey sadly ends in part 3, as Frodo and Sam along with Gollum are on their quest to destory the ring in the ragingfires of Mount Doom.  The dark lord Saruman is rising, and he must be stopped.  All in all, the film is grand and truly at epic scale.  I am also pleased to announce the Return of the King which received 4 Golden Globe nominations won all 4. It won Best Motion Picture Drama and Best Director (drama).  This is a good sign for the oscars, and this film might just take a lot of them home.Though this film does deserve five stars, I took one off for the ending, this is a 3 hour and 21 minute film and in the last 30 minutes it does get a bit tedious and seems to end several times.  All in all Peter Jackson's superb ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy are the 3 best fantasy films or our time.Return of the King is rated PG-13 for Intense Epic Battle Sequences and Frightening Images.  This one does feature the most violence, with intense but excellent battle scenes.  Nothing exceptionally graphic or unpleasant, and the sequences feature hardly any blood what so ever.  This one might scare younger children for the grotesque and horrifying monsters, along with the boisterous noises which they make.  A fine pick for the family though and surely one of the best films of 2003.A huge hit at the box-office already, which of course is no surprise."	4.0	Return of the King- A Welcomed Return	2004-01-26	7	2	5

Like the two proceeding it, Return of the King has awesome battles, wonderful music, and the end to an evil nemesis that plagued Middle Earth for so long.Return of the King made me wish that it was not the ending, but rather the beginning, its just so darn cool. Its not everyone that can make three movies so wonderful without losing focus on what the books where about. But Peter Jackson is definatly a master of the cinema. If you already haven't seen this movie in theaters, don't delay any longer and try to watch this on DVD.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3KOVFORKXQ2U9	Daniel McInnis	"I should probably begin this review with a confession: I've only seen this movie once, several months ago, upon it's initial release.  Why would this matter, you ask.  Well, I went only after reading numerous reviews placing this film among the greatest cinematic achievements of all-time, and my expectations were naturally sky high.  So, I suppose that it was all too inevitable that I would wind up disappointed.  The problem is, I actually liked the first two films and felt this, it's concluding chapter, was a real letdown.Now, I understand that it's unfair to hold the movie's failure to live up to my expectations against it, but that's the reality of the situation.  All I had heard for months leading up to ""Return's"" release was how awe-inspiring the final battle scene was going to be, and how it would blow away everything that we've seen in the previous two movies.  But when I actually saw it, I found myself asking, ""Was that it?""  And that's a question that you're libel to be asking yourself quite often as the movie seems to end about a half dozen different times.What the film does have going for it is that it's almost three and a half hours long, but doesn't feel a minute over two.  Now, that's quite a feat in it of itself and would normally be enough to earn this film a three star review on the basis of that fact alone.But getting back to the movie itself, I should probably mention what a phenomenal performance is given by Sean Astin, arguably the best of his career.  Much of the final film is placed on his shoulders, and he ably carries the weight of an epic, a feat I would have never imagined him capable of just a few years ago.  And at the end of the day it's he, Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis who are the ones primary responsible for giving these three movies their most important ingredient: humanity."	2.0	The Thrill is Gone	2004-05-12	11	4	7

In fact, damn near the ONLY two things this movie has are 1) special effects, and 2) an ""epic"" feel, due mostly to swooping landscape shots and occasionally (i.e. inconsistently) arcane dialogue.I wish I could give negative stars to offset the innumerable geeks and nerds (who undoubtedly use this movie to escape from their miserable, failed lives- you know who I'm talking about- those greasy faced centipedes that wear black tee-shirts touting a love of either a) Star Wars, b) Metallica, or c) Monster Trucks, who hang out at video arcades and play D&D; in dingy basements) who think this movie gives life meaning.Not since Titanic have I loathed a movie quite this much. In truth, I don't quite hate the movie as much as I hate what it represents, but make no mistake I do hate this movie.I could go on for hours about why I abhor this waste of celluloid, but for those who enjoy this tripe it would make no difference. So I'll spare you all the rant.

Sauroman was in this movie, however, not in his original form. If one remembers the second film, then one will surely remember that Sauroman was defeated, he thus was turned into an orc. Do you remember the white orc that looked like he had a tumor growing out of his head? Yes this was indeed Sauroman, hence the reason why Gandalf and the orc (Sauroman) paused and glanced at each other for a good while.Now to the movie. I have seen hundreds, probably thousands of movies and this one tops them all. It has everything one can ask for in a movie: action, suspense, horror, comedy, drama, etc. All of these elements are combined to bring the audience one hell of a movie. It may have been 4 hours long but it didn't seem it. I anxiously awaited every coming second of this movie. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. All the pieces were amazingly wrapped up, but you got every last drop of those pieces. People in the audience actually cheered after every part, you don't see that very often. The other two films were snubbed by the oscars, and if this film is, then i don't ever want to see another movie again, because if a film tops this i think i'd pass out and die. The Return of The King is singlehandedly the best piece of cinema ever made, and nothing will top it.	5.0	The best film ever made, and a few sage words for George Row	2003-12-22	5	2	3
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A239PPUVV8O0U0	D. A. Reed	So here it is, the crown jewel of the three films. While the third film was already a tiring (for some) 3 hour 20 minute venture, this extended edition of 50 new minutes of footage extends it to an impressive 4 hours and 10 minutes. Again the cast delivers and thanks to this extended version, Christopher Lee and the actors who played the Witch King and Mouth of Sauron (its been awhile since I've watched the documentaries); as I was anticipating to find out what happened to Saruman )Christopher Lee being one of my favorite actors) and was expecting a little more from the Witch King, how threatening Gandalf made him feel then all we see of him is in the big battle, fight Mirando Otto and then get defeated. I find it hard to critique this one as I find no faults with it at all, until we get to the end, where it does drag a little but that's an otherwise small complaint for an otherwise flawless film. Action sequences are the best of the three; the Battle of Pelennor Fields being the highlight and Sam's moment of fighting Shelob as a brilliant moment of the character showing his loyalty to his friend. Howard Shore again provides an excellent score and Into The West is a great, melancholy song to end the trilogy.	5.0	One Ring To Bring Them All And In The Darkness Bind Them	2009-11-04	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1G7EOJ1UEEVGX	Darth Bane	"There is one HUGE message that is carried over to yours truly in this DVD set - particularly on the Appendices on discs 3 and 4 - What am I going to do with MY life? I so am overwhelmed by the sheer dedication put into the making of this epic, that it moves me to ponder what I can do, what good thing could I leave this world before I pass on?What's not to love about this work of art and its backstory?From the way Viggo Mortensen completely immerses himself in his role by bonding with his co-actor horse in real life and making that extra effort to enhance the friendship and love with his co-stars, to the way the fans in New Zealand (and around the world for that matter) made so much effort to celebrate the Premiere... From the moralistic storyline of compassion, friendship, dedication and honour in the script itself to the inclusion of an inspiring homage to a young moviemaker in New Zealand who died of cancer (whose story inspired the film's end theme song, 'Into The West')... every single thing in this DVD is inspiring and entertaining. It sets the bar to the highest possible level, and no matter what I do in my lifetime, no matter what field of work I am in, I would want to do the job as well as Peter Jackson and his team did for Lord of The Rings.I am in awe of the people who made these films. Their story runs parallel to the movie itself, and their journey is in itself a wonderful tale.As for the extended movie itself, I have to say that it certainly makes The Return Of The King more complete. Because of the added scenes, you get to see what happened to Saruman (Jackson and co's take on it, that is, modified from the original book but in keeping with the important bits), you get the whole 'theme' of the returning of the days of the King even more enhanced, and of course you get a really cool and wicked new character - the Mouth of Sauron (eventhough the scene wasn't as long as I had hoped.... picky picky!)Writing reviews for this product in order for people to buy it is probably redundant... because it's such a ""must-have"" item, especially if youre an owner of a DVD player or a fan of fantasy, and further glorifying Tolkien and Peter Jackson and his crew is also probably redundant because they did after all win all those Academy Awards for the film, BUT as a scholar of the arts myself I just have to express my deepest respect and admiration for them."	5.0	An Inspiration... and a Challenge To Us All	2004-12-25	4	2	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2MW0RYIXMEYGS	Dave	Unbelievable.Ladies and gentlemen, I am writing this review on the eve of the release of the third and final installment of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, as adapted by Peter Jackson and New Line cinema. Fans such as I find it hard to accept that the nearly four year reign of the Rings trilogy is over. But it had to end sometime. Having just seen the movie, I simply have no choice but to share with you.PLOT: Hobbit Frodo Baggins of the Shire, aided by his friend Sam and guide Gollum, continues his quest to destroy the Ring of power, the one that, if regained by the Dark Lord Sauron, gives the wearer the ultimate power to rule the world. The catch is that the Ring corrupts any bearer; it was created for evil, and evil does it serve.Meantime, the original members of the Fellowship unite with the rest of the leaders of the free world to resist the unstoppable surge of Sauron's deadly, crushing army, 200,00 strong. The brunt of this force falls upon the land of Gondor, the bigger of the two kingdoms of men. Gandalf the White must ride with Pippin to Gondor, where he must work against the complacent Steward of Gondor to prepare for the oncoming war. Aragorn must claim his true destiny, in order to take command over an army of hideous, un-dead troops, who broke a pledge to Aragorn's ancestor long ago, and were cursed until they fulfilled it. All must come together to fight the most enormous battle of the age, both ours and theirs.BAD POINTS: Violence is the only complaint one can have. And violence abounds. One must expect it with the battles that take place, but one must also be warned, in case it might offend, or upset the younger generation. Orcs are killed in every imaginable way possible. Giant elephant-like enemy beasts stomp and gore troops to death. The very creepy Nazgl pick up, crush, and throw troops. A man is shown splashing oil on himself and his son, with the intention of burning them both alive. One of them is set afire, and runs aflame and throws himself off of a high point. During battle, the heads of previously slain soldiers are hurled over the city walls by the orcs. A giant spider stings and then wraps Frodo up, before doing combat with Sam. Gollum's former identity Sm&eacute;agol is shown strangling a fellow hobbit to death for the Ring. All this and more take place. I don't mind, because violence must take place if Right must triumph over Wrong. But you have the right to know.GOOD POINTS: The special effects are ground-breaking, that much is obvious. But the incredible emotion, the power, the grandeur of it all is enough to make you cry, and I nearly did. My companions (appropriately dressed for the occasion: I as Aragorn, my brother as Gandalf, my sister as &Eacute;owyn) cried a lot. This movie is bound to storm the awards ceremonies, and top the box office for the next month in the least.My friend, words do not do justice to how incredible and colossally amazing this film is. From the tear-jerking resolve of Sam, to the gritty, stern determination of Gandalf and Aragorn, this film is pure Tolkien magic through and through. I don't care if you are a Tolkien fan or not, you will enjoy this movie. I'd stake my reputation on it.200 out of 10 stars, and that's severely undercutting it.	5.0	Amazing, beyond belief.

I am glad that they finally got the last part of the series finished off and the actors and actresses have put so much work into the last film and it's going to be hard that there will be no more films after this but to me it was well worth it for them to give it the best that they got. I am glad that they accomplished on what they needed to get done with the last trilogy and got it over with. I watched all three movies myself and I got widescreen on both the regular sets and the extended sets as well.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	"""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"", starring Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortenson, and others, is the final chapter of this trilogy.  Most trilogies begin falling in quality after the second or third edition.  This trilogy stays on top through every edition.  This edition won an amazing four Golden Globes and a record-tying eleven Oscars(clean sweap in both ceremonies), both including Best Picture and Best Director.  ""Ben-Hur"" (1959) and ""Titanic"" (1997) are the only other films to win eleven.  Like ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"", this honors the book version, written by JRR Tolkins, delightfully.  This also is one of the greatest action and fantasy films created in many years.  Such quality proves that the eight years spent on production and the two years spent on filming were spent wisely.  Since release, it's become the second highest grossing film worldwide with more than $1 billion in the Box Office, only exceeded by ""Titanic"".""The Return of the King"" explores the further threat of the end of peaceful civilization.  Frodo's ring takes over him more, the wars become more grand, Aragon's fight for the throne grows more crutial, and the odds of survival become slimmer.  The spectacular chain of events keep audiences interested and amazed in every moment.  Director Peter Jackson leads the cast and crew to accomplish this masterpiece, which keeps audiences intact until the end.  The action scenes become more intense throughout the film.  Frodo's duty of destroying the ring grows more crutial, which grows more difficult because of Gollum's yearning for the ring.  However, the dramatic and the emotional theme never fades.  The characters' emotions are always expressed to the fullest as they should.  Therefore, this is more than an action/fantasy film.The score, written by Howard Shore, blends perfectly with the events.  The fight scenes become more intense, and the dramatic vibes become more emotional.  While some songs are used for all three editions, the new ones are great editions to the trilogy.  Certain symphonies will become as well-known as the ""Star Wars"" or the ""ET: The Extra Terrestrial"" theme in the following years.  ""Into the West"" is a great ballad to end the movie, which is played in the end credits.  Annie Lennox sings it beautifully and emotionally.  It wonderfully commemorates and gives more closure to this film and trilogy.The visionaries offer a more grand viewing experience.  The spectacular background is nothing like most other films.  The amazing hard work spent on the graphics and the millions spent on it paid off greatly.  Many filmmakes considered such perfection impossible before the film was released.  Regardless, it never distracts from the storyline's emotional aspect.  The costumes and the make-up wonderfully blend with the old-time theme.  The characters' physical features are realistic-looking.  The evil citizens become more scary-looking thanks to the artists.The actors express the emotional aspects wonderfully.  Sean Astin performs at his career best in this film as Sam, who determinely supports Frodo through the journey.  Ian McKellen's Oscar-nominated role for ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" as Gandolf is to be highly noted, though slightly less demanding on this edition.  Elijah Wood expresses Frodo's struggles wonderfully.  As Frodo's well-being becomes increasingly in jeopardy, Wood accomplishes the process in every step.  All other actors add their own unique sense of being in the film.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AUEHG0DB54B7K	David A. Wend	"With 50 minutes of film that was not in the theatrical release of Return of the King, this director's cut should satisfy just about everyone.  Two important scenes, the murder of Saruman by Grima Wormtongue and the healing of Eowyn by Aragon, eliminate the gaps.  In addition, the meeting between Eowyn and Faramir actually takes place so we are not wondering why they are together at the coronation of Aragon and a tense scene where Frodo and Sam (dressed in armor as Orcs) are almost discovered by the enemy.  There are smaller restored scenes that, in retrospect, help to explain some details.  For example, why does Gandalf appear without his staff during the battle of Plennor Fields?  Because the Witch King appeared and shattered it!  This is not an essential scene but it adds detail.  Many battle scenes were included and gave the puffy-faced Orc commander who declares ""the time of the Orc has come"" some additional exposure, and we know who ends up killing him.The Return of the King now runs to 4 hours and 10 minutes - unmanageable for movie theaters but perfect for home viewing.  If this film had been released 40 years or more ago the footage would have been lost.  The footage cut from Lawrence of Arabia was eventually restored but whatever happened to the film culled from Gone With The Wind?  So it is good to be having Peter Jackson's final cut of Return of the King even if you can't watch it all in one sitting."	5.0	All the Questions Answered	2005-01-10	6	5	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	"Peter Jackson concludes his landmark version of JRR Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings.""  Frodo, Sam, and Gollum reach Mount Doom, where the ring is to be destroyed, while the remainder of the fellowship gather at the massive city of Minas Tirith to face Sauron's legions in a tremendous battle that surpasses any that I have ever seen on film before.  This is the best of the LOTR films; the complete arc of the story is now evident and the trilogy stands revealed as one of the greatest achievements in adventure cinema.  The special effects are both eye-poppingly spectacular (as in the afore-mentioned battle) and incredibly subtle (it is easy to forget that Gollum is a CGI creation).The backlash against this film's admittedly excessive hype has set in, with many declaring that its essentially lightweight story precludes it being considered a great film.  I would say that it-and the trilogy as a whole-is a great film *of its type.*  Every film cannot be judged by the same measure.  While the LOTR movies do not have the psychological heft of more serious cinema, it is difficult to beat them for sheer spectacle, fun, and exhalation at the possibilities of  film.  It really seems that we have reached a time when any visual that we can imagine can also be realized on screen.  Therefore, I have no problem awarding five stars to both ROTK and a more ""meaningful"" film such as, say, Ingmar Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers.""  Both films are trying to do different things and do them exceedingly well./"	5.0	The epic conclusion does not disappoint	2004-01-07	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AAE2DUEMTR30I	DAVID BRYSON	McKellen seemed to be hinting on a recent television appearance that we are not saying goodbye to our hobbits and their friend Mr Jackson. If I heard him aright we may yet expect The Hobbit and maybe more than that. What I am referring to is the end of the film which is a restrained tear-jerker as Frodo, Bilbo aged eleventy-five, Gandalf and the rest of them set off from the Grey Havens. The wind-up, post the downfall of Sauron, is kept commendably short. The events of the Field of Cormallen in the book seemed to me interminable, but Jackson avoids this. This is basically an action-and-effects movie, really just as Independence Day and the Indiana Jones films were that, and I commend it for both.Newcomers to the story, supposing there still are any, are given a quick enacted synopsis of how the ring was first found and how it got into the hands of Smeagol while he was still a regular hobbit. The action then takes up from where The Two Towers left off, with Treebeard and the ents left restoring the ruined surroundings of Isengard as an arboreal environment It was nice to see him again for a moment before the divided Fellowship moves on to the defence of MinasTirith and Osgiliath on the one hand, and the ascent of the stairs of Cirith Ungol and the encounter with Shelob on the other. The battle scenes seemed to me every bit as good as in The Two Towers, indeed better because this time we have the army of the dead on top of the already familiar orcs, trolls,oliphaunts and nazgul. Shelob is brilliantly done, the part of Denethor Steward of Gondor almost amounts to a piece of acting, the various towers are beautifully designed and differentiated, and of course nature herself has made rather a distinguished contribution by way of background, served by the superb camera work that we have now come to take for granted.McKellen lends the casting a much-needed touch of distinction as before, and the rest of the cast need no more comment by this stage. Those who like vertiginous effects, as I do, will get a feast of them this time, and if I have one minor disappointment it is that the wrathful but impotent giant relic of Sauron could have been more impressively done simply by following the description in the book. I tried to see whether Sam's hobbit-wife Rosie had hairy feet like the males of the species but was unable to determine this one way or the other. It's unlikely that anyone reading this review will not have seen the previous two episodes, and even more unlikely that anyone who does not like the story will be reading it anyway. For any and all others, it will live up to your expectations. There is a real touch of directorial brilliance in the final tussle between Frodo and Gollum in the Cracks of Doom, and I shall not spoil that for you.	5.0	TO SAY GOODBYE IS TO DIE A LITTLE	2003-12-17	4	4	0

I've never read the Tolkien books, but to me the final installment of this epic film trilogy pulls the whole story together and makes it work better than any of the three segments does on its own.I like this movie a lot, and will watch it again, but I do think it would have worked better if it had ended with the crowning of Aragorn and his speech to the assembled multitude. The 15-20 minutes after that seemed anti-climactic, and left me wondering: ""Why DID Frodo sail off with the Elves?""I suppose diehard Tolkien fans would have screamed and moaned if the movie had ended earlier, but I thought it made the whole thing a wee bit too long and didn't add to the story. Heck, they could have put the last scenes on the ""extra features"" disc, for those who wanted to see them.That said, I still give this movie 4 stars, and would urge people to see the whole trilogy for maximum understanding and enjoyment!"	4.0	A worthy conclusion to an epic trilogy	2004-07-08	1	0	1

If you are a busy person it may take you a while to watch all the special features. Anyway, this is definitely a worthwhile purchase, whether you're a diehard fan or just a casual one. The special features are mostly 30-45 minutes documentaries about things like the digital effects team, the horses used for the movie, editing the movie, and how the writers adapted the book to the screenplay. Almost all of them are interesting and informative. As for the movie, it has a ton of new and extended scenes, which are very good. The commentary is interesting too. All in all, you can't be without this if you're at least a casual fan of the movies. Be sure to buy this instead of the two-disc regular version, which has few special features and no new scenes.

Nagy ""eldamahj"""	While it is easy to admire the scope and effort behind Peter Jackson's TLOTR series, anyone who thinks Jackson was true to Tolkien's masterwork is fooling themselves. There is next to no scene which doesn't either have the wrong characters speaking the wrong lines (ie. as per the book -thus destroying any character development that Tolkien intended) or else an 'introduced' bit of dialogue from the screenwriters themselves which only served to reinforce their new version of the characters. Personally, I love Tolkien's work, and am constantly offended by critics and reviewers alike who think using the same title and character names (but not much more) from the book is some proof that the contents of the books were respected. They were not. So when Galadriel speaks in the first film (FOTR) with lines which came from Treebeard, and when Gandalf 'disposseses' King Theoden of Saruman (?!) (in TTT ) and when Gimli notes that the Army of the Dead 'would come in handy', all my pleasure at these films whithers and dies. Call it as it is, a big effort but a poor effort at bringing an epic to the screen. One might say that by pumping the film full of effects and reducing the dialogue to either simplistic obvious kitsch or cheesy American one liners, Peter Jackson has reduced an epic tale to a disposable 'film of the week'. Well done (sarcasm). As for the Oscar for Best Screen Adaption - give me a break. It couldn't be any worse.	1.0	No scene unchanged.	2004-12-06	128	24	104
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3QC0JW8WI04KF	"David M. Beall ""dbeall"""	"This extraordinary film will no doubt be even more amazing with the extended edition. This can be said with confidence based upon the first two films. The extended cuts make much more sense, and once seen you can not go back to the theatrical cuts.The film is great because it is based on one of the most inspiring and popular books of all time. To call these films fantasy is to misrepresent them, they should be called Mythological History.The effort, talent and cost effectiveness of the trilogy is without peer. It won 17 Oscars with 30 nominations. Countless other awards including much recognition for it's ensemble cast.Although it cost about $300m to make - if it had been made in the USA with ""Hollywood"" actors, technicians etc it would of cost over $1b to make. Every aspect of film making reached a pinnacle of artistic and technical achievement. To compare this level of brilliance with other 'flavors of the month' was always destined to be rather silly.Some of the key messages of the story still seem to pass over the heads of the audience. Tolkien was an environmentalist and a Catholic and a bit of a Luddite (bless him). Tolkein would be horrified by what is going on in the US today vis a vis deceitful preemptive aggression, destruction of the environment, ludicrous energy policy, and using Religion to con people with blind faith, and no mislead people stuck in the parochial and jingoistic universe devoid of objective information.So next time you see Orcs felling trees, the ring of power falling into the hands of shallow souls, scarred landscapes replacing the Shire and the wisdom and plight of the Ents - the next time you this type of stuff - try and think about what Tolkien is trying say. This film was meant to be a parable - and like any good parable it remains applicable for the ages, just like Orwells 1984. This trilogy, extended addition runs 11 hours and 25 minutes and while that might numb ones backside - do not let it numb the brain"	5.0	One of the best, maybe the best film of all time	2004-10-05	60	17	43
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2LEVKA3U6CXX7	"David McCune ""self-deprecating and proud of it"""	"This review presumes that the reader has seen the theatrical version of the Return of the King.  That movie as a whole was excellent, well-deserving of its critical and commercial success and 5 stars.  This review looks at the narrower question of how the extended and new scenes add to the original.One of the flaws with the theatrical release was that, in order to trim the running time for audiences, scenes were removed that moved the plot forward in minor ways.  As a result, the finished product was a bit choppy.  The DVD corrects that in several key areas.New scenes that work:Why was the palantir sitting in the ruins of Orthanc? ExplainedWhy are Frodo and Sam in orc armor in one scene, out of it the next?  There is now the scene (directly from the book) ""In the Company of Orcs""How do Faramir and Eowyn go from near death to in love?  The scene from ""The Houses of Healing"" is included.Missed the Mouth of Sauron?  Well he's here, and this was one of the places where Jackson's departure from a literal retelling of the book worked best.  I still can't believe that this scene was cut.New scenes that add little:In some of the scenes that differ from the book, I prefer the book version, but recognize that the DVD version probably works at least as well.  Aragorn's use of the palantir falls into that category.  Sadly, the (continuing) omission of the Scouring of the Shire probably does as well.New scenes that detract:The extended scenes from the Paths of the Dead are unnecessary.  The theatrical version had a better impact.  The new scenes create repetitive plot elements and veer into Indiana Jones territory.  And finally, readers will be happy to learn that the goodbye scene at the end has NOT been extended.Technical:I recommend having the remote control handy, or permission to have the house shaking during the battle scenes.  The range of volume from battle to dialogue is very broad.  be prepared to either listen closely or annoy the neighbors.So overall, the DVD provides a clear upgrade over the theatrical version.  Compared to the quality of the added/extended scenes in other films, this is far superior.  I would also rate it slightly better than the improvements in the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AYOPN5ABOAUER	DavidRoss	"I have loved Tolkien's trilogy since first reading it in the '60s. Peter Jackson's film of the first book was a masterpiece, beautifully realizing the most ambitious fantasy tale ever written. Clearly Jackson and the entire cast & crew regarded this project as a labor of love, and they seemed to understand that at heart LOTR is not a story about swords & sorcerers, but about the character of ordinary people who rise to the occasion when fate demands.After that astonishing achievement, the second film (LOTR: THE TWO TOWERS) was a bit disappointing.  The story bogged down, with far too much screen time devoted to the battle at Helm's Deep (perhaps the difficulties involved in shooting that scene affected Jackson's judgment in editing), and a few too many liberties were taken with the story.  Consequently I approached LOTR: THE RETURN OF THE KING with bated breath, hoping it would equal the standard set by the first film, but fearing another letdown like the second.  At first I was pleasantly surprised.  As the story unfolded, scene after scene revealed the same loving fidelity to Tolkien's novel that made LOTR: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING so astonishing.  Jackson's success seemed complete, the film an utter triumph.And then it happened: For some unfathomable reason, Jackson and his colleagues rewrote the ending of Tolkien's beloved masterpiece-and they didn't just leave out a scene or two barely relevant to the story (as with Tom Bombadil in the 1st part).  This time they gutted the book's final three chapters, cutting the story of the Hobbits' return to the Shire, their discovery of Saruman's vengeance, and the courageous rallying of their countrymen to rise against Saruman's gang of thugs and free their homeland of his tyranny.  Jackson's revised ending-in which the hobbits simply return home to business as usual-felt like a monstrous betrayal.  His revision denies the hobbits' growth, eviscerates their character, and even emasculates them as well.  By cheating his audience at the end, Jackson effectively plunges a dagger deep into the moral heart of the story.  A bitter disappointment, indeed.Perhaps Jackson cut the ending in order to maximize profits.  Perhaps he plans (in accord with the pattern established by the first two films) eventually to release an ""extended version"" DVD which will restore Tolkien's ending.  We shall see.  In the meantime, if you are acquainted with only these movies and not the books, but have come to love the story and its characters, then I strongly suggest that you read the books (particularly the end of the last book) to see what you're missing, and to see why Tolkien's LOTR transcends genre to rank as one of the finest literary achievements of the 20th Century. Then you will understand why--in spite of its excellence in most respects-Jackson's LOTR at best deserves no more than 4 stars."	4.0	Almost great, but Jackson's revised ending badly flawed.	2004-02-16	3	1	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2IE7YPWUYZAXS	David Wilson	This is a hard film to review.  The movie is technically awe inspiring and the acting is, for the most part, extremely well done.  Peter Jackson should be commended for that.  However, Jackson was not able to keep to deliver the true depth of the original work found in the books.  That is unforgivable.  I hate to say it but I think Jackson was the wrong person to bring this story to the screen.  He is a B-grade movie director and his efforts here show it.  He revels in all the technical whiz-bangery that can be had but he fails in bringing any of the real depth to the story that Tolkein so meticulously included in the books.  I am not talking about changing things that may need to be changed in the translation of a book (especially a long book) to the silver screen.  Rather, I am talking about, for example, the totally misguided and unnecessary changing of character&#65533;s personalities.  Why make Gandalf have so much doubt?  Isn't he the person that was sent back from the dead to finish his work on Middle Earth?  In the book we know that the powers that sent him back instill much confidence in him.  There was no reason to change this in the movie.  This change added nothing to the story but only took away a strong character from the plot.Another problem that I have with this adaptation is the inclusion of scenes that are not needed for the telling of the story.  For example, way too much was made of Arwen.  Arwen does not play that big a role in the books (even including the appendices).  I think a good hour between the three films could have been saved and used for building more depth into the story via, for example, better character development.Simple things that should have been in the film and would have been easy to do were not done.  For example, the Pelennor Fields in the book were farm lands with homes, barns, roads, etc.  Not a deserted plain as in the movie.  When Mordor attacked the sky grew dark from the fires of Mt. Doom (also darkening Frodo and Sam's trek across Mordor).  Adding these two things would have made the battle scenes much more interesting visually while adding a great sense of loss experienced by Gondor and increasing the sense of fear experienced by the defenders of Minas Tirith.I could go on but you get the point.  Technically the movie is a 5 star movie.  Good acting gets 4 stars.  But, other than the technical aspects and acting, the movie is a 1 or 2 star movie.  Evens out to a 3.	3.0	Technically Brilliant but not True to Tolkein.	2004-01-08	29	7	22

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	This third and final installment to Peter Jackson's cinematic interpretation of the Lord of the Rings is a triumph for all involved despite its flaws.  As Frodo, Sam, and Gollum approach Mordor in the attempt to destroy the ring, the kingdoms of man face brutal attacks that must be defended against all odds.  Especially compared to the second film, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; the action is well-balanced and tightly portrayed, with only a few scenes lasting too long.  As with the others, the cinematography is captivating and even breath-taking at times.  The computer graphics are, except in one or two cases, successfully integrated, with the Orc army a phenomenal achievement with its individualized &quot;actors.&quot;Many of the movie's difficulties derive from the translation of the book to film.  The complicated nature of the story line and cast of characters cannot be easily shown with visuals, even three and a half hours of them, resulting in some confusing scenes and relationships especially for those unfamiliar with the books.  The biggest, and only inexcusable, flaw for me was directorial.  Jackson chooses an overly sentimental tone to &quot;end&quot; the film - four or five times.  The music gets jacked up, the camera shows tight close-ups of supposedly meaningful expressions, the screen fades out, and, oops, here comes another scene that goes through the same throes of sentimentality.  The result is akin to a symphony that sounds its big, ending notes, only to then return to the less dramatic middle of the movement.  These false endings get downright annoying, and the Hollywood-type treatment mars this otherwise spectacular film.I still give this film five stars because of the remarkable achievement of bringing this story to dramatic life.  &quot;The Return of the King&quot; is the best of the trilogy with its nearly perfect balance of action and set-up, and with the ensemble acting really hitting its stride.  Do not see this film without having seen the others, as none stands well on its own.  This riveting epic will undoubtedly become a film classic.

It is powerful with great filming, characterization, and special effects. The acting was great with the friendship between Frodo and Sam being especially powerful, an accurate reflection of the book. It is hard to imagine finer casting possible for the roles. In many cases films are not nearly as good as the book, but this is different.

So the question - are you rabid enough you cannot wait until the extended version?  Okay, I am, so I preordered this.  I will buy the extended version too, because as long as this movie is it does not begin to handle everything.  If you would never watch the expected 5 hour version, go for this copy.  Regular screen you LOSE TOO MUCH of the movie lopped off the sides.All those of you who get this and intend to get the extended version as I shall - there is coupon to get bucks back so don't lose that.Simply amazing to put all three movies on and let them runs one right after another.Brilliance, magic, a century from now the power will still be there!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AFEOC3D8WKN1D	Deirdre	"Note: Too those who are using this review as a book to movie comparison: STOP IT! Thank you and have a nice day.First thing I have to say, yes they left out the Sack of the Shire and much more material, but you know what, this is a 4-hour movie okay, if everybodies demand was met, this film would be six hours. When it comes to the quality of the movie for what it is, it's fantastic, great new sequences, that are great, excpt one......The only bad sequence in this movie was The Mouth of Sauron, ""The Mouth"" is basically a demented human being whom Sauron has basically posessed and turned into his minion. Now the sketches for this creature (which they show you in the special features) looked great, on screen, they were a mess, so bad in fact that the whole sequence became a comedy. ""The Mouth"", in concept, is a being who is designed to look like an evil priest, he wears a large, veil-like helmet, that makes him look disturbing and sage-like. His mouth is slit open at parts and filled with rotting teeth. Now this sounds fantastic but on screen it's hysterical. His helmet is large and bulky, it looks so big that it appears he might fall off his steed at in moment. But the biggest flaw, was whenever he delivered a line, he tilted his head back and grinned, I don't know what was funny about this, but it was, probably because he through himself into his grin so much, he looked like he was a demented being trying to audition for Barney. If you watch the sequence for yourself, you'll know what I mean.I recommend this addition for ""Rings"" fans only, it will only bore anyone else."	5.0	The Return of the King - Extended version	2007-11-29	1	1	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3VLX5Z090RQ0V	"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut"""	"What a crazy and jumpy two years this has been for me.  Since 2001, I've seen 'The Fellowship of the Ring' fighting against the Uruk Hai, and they were on their feet when they're at raging battles against Sauron's minions from 'The Two Towers'; Man, and to think all these spectacular moments were authorized by an englishman with a sharp mind and a sense of imagination, but known little by the general audience back in the days, even I didn't known about his work if it wasn't for the first film.  And now, there's the finale.  The big cheese, the cream de la creme, the tip of the blade, ""The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King.""  If many people think this last installment of the whole trilogy would be just as disasterous as 'The Godfather: Part III' and 'The Matrix Revolutions', well, they're wrong!The story continues after 'The Two Towers' where Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam continue on a journey to destroy the Ring of Power at the fiery Cracks of Doom with Gollum, that creepy, lovable, schizophrenic, morbid hobbit with a fetish for the Ring of Power, as their guide.  Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Aragon, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and my favorite, Gimli, have found the other hobbits, Mary and Pippin, at Orthank Tower where the hobbits, with the help from the animatronical trees, stop Saruman's plans for the constant attempts to corrupt their journey.  Later when the fellowship retrived the Orb of Sauron's eye and Pippin touching the orb when no one's looking, he just visualize a predicament of the city of the kings, Minus Tirith, surrounded by the inferno.  Gandalf and Pippin then decides to go to Minus Tirith to tell the downfall that awaits the people of Minus Tirith, and a long-winded but glorious battle that awaits them as well, all prolonging the true battle that bring the people from different nations and the fellowship together--the decisive battle.Shock...and awe.  I was shocked with the surprising dramatic moments and the interesting character development of the whole storyline and awed when I see the impressive visual direction of the convoluted battles and fictional atmosphere.  ""The Return of the King"" relives everything that occur in the first two installments: the return of the fellowship, the return of of Narsil, the sword that defeated Sauron in the beginning, the return of family greivances, and the return of battles that are more gruesome that the Battle of the Last Great Alliance!  I might be going ahead of myself, but to put it simply: This movie is excellent!  The special effects, the CG animation and the Maya-inspired background of places, all are impressively well-done.  I actually had my eyes open wide and 'oohing' over these visuals at certain scenes.  Sure, the visuals make the movie fatigued, but at least New Line doesn't make it the overall focus of the film like in most of action films I've seen.It's good that New Line continues to not insult my intelligence with the book-to-film transition.  I may not have read J-dubba-R's books, but I believe New Line did a good job on the transition, with how the story progress and how the characters  are very convincing with their emotions. I'm surprised that this movie would have a back story of Gollum in the beginning, back when he's called himself Smeagol, though somehow the back story seems a bit rushed.  Execution is the first thing the movie company does best with the first two ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, and ""Return of the King"" is no different:  Great acting, a musical score that bring tears of mixed feelings, a sense of adrenaline during battle sequences, and to the point, something that everyone can love about this movie, not matter if they're into action, drama, romance, or comedy; yes, there is some comedic moments in this movie.It's hard to figure out why I shouldn't give ""The Return of the King"" five stars.  Maybe because this is not true to the book, or maybe 3 1/2 hours is just too long of a movie to see, or maybe it ain't 'urban' enough for all homies to check out, or myabe just too surrealistic.  For me, personally, these are just petty personal flaws.  ""The Return of the King"" is great from beginning to end, and it's a wonderful end to a wonderful trilogy; heck, even this movie alone is better than the last two 'Matrix' films put together.  A deeply embracive and heart-warming film like this should fare no less than five stars."	5.0	The return of the PRECIOUS Tolkien franchise!	2003-12-18	3	1	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3UW23DBF2KHWC	Denis Vukosav	From 2002 to 2004, for the fans of The Lord of the Rings the end of each year was marked by an extended edition of one of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.Although the plot of this and other two parts of trilogy is familiar to everyone, in few words the plot of this third and final part is about Frodo and Sam, who with the Gollum's help and obstacles continue their way to Mount Doom. Gandalf and Pippin are riding to Minas Tirith to help defend Gondor while Merry stays with Eowyn and the other Rohan fighters. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are seeking help from those who live in the Cursed Mountains. And all these battles have only one main goal, to distract the Eye of Sauron and to buy Frodo a little more time to destroy the ring.The first two discs contain the film in great 2.35:1 anamorphic video, split to permit the four commentaries and Dolby EX and DTS ES audio tracks. The movie can be used for presentation of your home theater and even greatest expert cannot distinguish where computer graphics left off and the real action took over. The viewer should just sit back and enjoy in this vast, legendary epic tale.Added is almost 50 minutes of extra material, which makes this 3rd part not only longest of the set, but truly epic in length. While most added scenes add nicely to the experience, some slow the pace significantly, but Peter Jackson's desire to give favorite moments from the original books even though they are not strictly necessary for the movie is obvious. Many of the extended scenes are in the battles. More computer graphics was added to additionally make sure the audience would get to witness the carnage of battles. But extra scenes also include the final conflict between the Gandalf and his former friend wizard Saruman, a bit more of what happened between Frodo, Sam and Gollum, emotional scene between Faramir and Eowyn, Pippin scene when he is being fitted with Faramir's armor and few more. What is most important and almost unbelievable is no matter how much longer movie is, the time spent watching seems to fly by.With the standards imposed by the first two extended editions, this one has also lot of additional extras. Included are four commentary tracks with the crew remarks ranging from highly technical to a chit-chat of group of friends discussing their experience. An especially interesting commentary is by Andy Serkis, picturing Gollum, who provides a conflicted commentary featuring the duel personality of his character Gollum and Smeagol. Next included are several featurettes, starting from comprehensive compendium of Middle Earth. &#34;J.R.R. Tolkien: The Legacy of Middle-Earth&#34; showing richness of world created by book author; next one is &#34;From Book to Script&#34; explaining the work about deciding which scenes should be brought from the book to the screen, not possible to film it all, of course. Also, the amazing efforts of hand crafters are filmed because every one of thousands of props and the smallest details of each set were hand crafted. There is also a documentary about computer graphics company, Weta Workshop, which made all this impossible special effects, gallery of production photos and couple of other documentaries about music and editing - you'll need lot of time to go through all of them.No matter what you are thinking about the movie and the trilogy itself, this is the only way a movie of this importance should be presented.	5.0	This is the only way a movie of this importance should be presented	2013-07-27	0	0	0

All he did was act tired - WOW give him the Oscar now.I have no idea why these films or books are so popular... are people that disillusioned with life that they need hobbits and dragons to make themselves feel good? I don't care that it took 25 years or whatever to make these films and Peter Jackson is regarded as a genius. This film is boring and lame - just like the first two movies. And it's also non-sensical, case in point: the flying dragon things and the super tough mean guy were supposedly the toughest, meanest things in the whole world. Well some chick kills the dragon in like 2 seconds and the tough guy in like 3 seconds. WHY? The movie doesn't explain at all how the good guys are suddenly all-powerful and can't be defeated. Anyway I give this movie a 1 because I couldn't care less about some mystical world and some dumb ring.	1.0	UGGHHH	2005-06-21	120	8	112

Before I reveal what I already know about ROTK. I'll just start out with my personal experiences with the first two movies in the Trilogy.FOTR: When I first saw the trailer in theaters for this one I wasn't too enthused. It simply wasn't the type of movie that I would rush out to see. Then it released and rumors of it spread like wildfire of how awesome it was. I decided I'd go and check it out. From the opening minutes I knew I was in for a very high quality ride, something that is lacking from todays movies for the most part. Watching Gandalph in that ""silly"" pointy hat as he rode across the fantasy-like countryside through the Shire and then off to Isengard was the exact moment at which I was hooked and sucked into this incredible world! This was unlike anything I had ever seen before and to see it being done so wonderfully, so proudly, so BLATANTLY, as if it were writing the law on how fantasy movies (and movies in general) should be done, was just mind-boggling! This deal was fully sold after watching Gandalf's battle with the Balrog. The word ""EPIC"" kept running through my mind throughout that scene as well as the whole movie and I knew I needed to own it ASAP! I was hooked! Just like most everyone else, I'd bet!! I bought the animated version and it satiated me for a while. But just barely. I was inspired to learn more about the whole LOTR world and I was fascinated. I bought the DVD the day it came out and the Extended version after that. The Extended version was a bit choppy and slow, but told the whole tale. I am very happy with it as well as my whole FOTR experience!TTT: At first I didn't like this one as much as the first because it seemed to lack that blatant fantasy feel of the first. And it also seemed to move too quickly, as though the whole movie was rushing to get to the climatic battle at Helm's Deep. Still I bought the DVD the day it came out, and watched it again and it seemed to get much better the more I watched it. But it wasn't until I bought the Extended version of TTT that I fell completely in love with it! Omg, what a VAST improvement! This is what it should have been in the first place! Incredible amounts of story telling, back story, and required elements were placed back in, making the extended version the truly superior version in ALL ways! If any of you do not own this yet, BUY IT NOW!! You WON'T be let down! Because of this version I like TTT a bit better than FOTR right now!ROTK: Now this is a true story... A friend of mine's dad knows one of the producers of the films and she invited him and a few others to a viewing of the complete version of ROTK on a special DVD. After seeing it, my friend's dad was so completely blown away, he couldn't stop talking about it for a week! He had already read the books before watching any of the movies, and is kind of a LOTR nut. He loves the first two movies and owns them on DVD. But he says that ROTK is even much, Much BETTER than the first two COMBINED!! Now whether he's biased or not doesn't make much difference to me. If it's even only half as good as he's been saying it is, we are all in for a really delicious treat! I personally cannot wait and I'll probably be one of those people camping out the next day to see it once it hits theaters, heh! It looks like this trilogy is set to replace even the legendary Classic Star Wars trilogy as the king of of all! This is the one for our generation! We all thought Matrix was going to win that crown, but as you know it kinda dropped the ball. This will truly be The Lord of All Movies!Well, just my two and a half cents plus tax.**UPDATE 12/17/2003 4:23AM PST**(SPOILER FREE)Well I just watched the Midnight showing of ROTK and I must say... What a letdown! It wasn't the greatest and best movie ever made of all time (even though it came close)... sheesh! But I guess that is too much to ask, huh. Anyways, what can I say.. I guess my friend's dad was RIGHT!! This truly is the best of the trio and literally better than the first two combined!! Now after watching all three, I look back on them and wonder why I do not see these as being mere ""movies"". They're more like a giant crisp clear ""window"" offering a view of another living breathing world. And within this vibrant developed world comes an incredibly epic compelling story that simply must be told. Stunning. Breathtaking. Captivating. Awesome. Terrific.

I don't own the Return of the King but I asked my parents for the extended version for christmas. I have already seen the theatrical version three times. Peter Jackson has really made a master piece with this movie. And I think that any Tolkien purist out there who complains about this movie needs to shut up. You should be happy that he has made one of the best and closest adaptaions we will ever have to these books. Some of the things that he took out of the movie he took out because the movies would be too long and they weren't even important to the plot.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2UDSLXX9SJC00	Dianne	This is such an excellent movie.  The basic themes of the story are classics: hope, friendship, courage.  This is the ultimate good vs. evil.  The fate of the world is in the hands of two of the most unlikely people, and they are struggling with little hope of survival.  Meanwhile, there friends are fighting what may seem to be equally hopeless battles.  Everyone is outnumbered, but they keep fighting.  But the movie is not just about the battle, it is about the people of Middle Earth.  Their struggles are so incredibly difficult, but they keep going.  We are brought right into their journeys, and experience their emotions.The casting is excellent.  Elijah Wood as Frodo is one of the most exceptional young actors I have ever seen.  He is so emotional that you cannot help but feel his anguish.  And Viggo Mortenson as the soon-to-be king is such an excellent choice.  Even the supporting cast is stellar.  There is not a bad actor or a bad performance in the movie.The special effects are incredible.  The crew put so much effort into the creation of this world that it is easy to forget it is all make-believe.  Each of the places they have created is detailed and flawless.  It is almost impossible to tell which armies are CG and which are real.  They have even included CG horses.Everything comes together perfectly in this movie.  The score Howard Shore creates is so perfect for each scene.  The writers have adapted JRR Tolkien's words so well that I challenge anyone to find a better adaptation.  The actors have taken these words and played their parts magnificently.  And the crew have all done exactly what was necessary to make this a movie for the ages.  I can't imagine anyone missing this movie.	5.0	Beyond worthy	2004-04-16	6	4	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1MEQOSGAR5ZCN	DIRK	"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? Well actually...quite a bit! How about the fact that it's a decent film, but overrated...at least by all those who deem it to be ""perfect"". I'm sorry, but this film -- as great as its battles are, and as entertaining as its denouement is -- has its share of problems. Am I the only one who felt like it went on way past its bedtime? There was at least one full hour of stuff that could have been cut from this picture and I would not even have blinked an eye. Did they really need to include a lame subplot about a nutty king and his son? It dragged the story down, cut into the action and to be honest, added yet another part to an epic that already had too many balls in the air to begin with. The film's 3-4 different endings were also ridiculously out of line. Dude, we've traveled all this way with these folks, the deeds are done...end it already! Why drag things out for scene upon scene upon scene, many of which would have been better left to the audience's imagination. Remember: this is the movie...NOT the book. I love Peter Jackson. I think he's a genius and I doubt that anyone else could have done such a great job with these three films, but this final episode is...let's face it, a little self-indulgent. The studio allowed him free reign (and rightfully so, to a certain extent), he let himself go (although strangely didn't think we needed to actually see Saruman's fate) and the movie got a little bloated and redundant because of that.Is it a good movie? Sure. I'm not going to sit here and pretend that it doesn't scream accomplishment, innovation, entertainment and epic in many senses of the words, but it's got its issues as well and they need to be acknowledged. Anyway, all that said (it needed to be), RETURN OF THE KING does continue its tradition of GREAT action sequences, many characters and plotlines intertwined and continuing suspense dealt upon its fellowship of do-gooders. Frodo and Sam continue to struggle with Gollum and his antics (loved the flashback to Smeagol...nice), Legolas continues to look far into the horizon and sense danger (his elephant-beast ride was the  bomb!), Gimli continues to crack wise (still feels out of place) and Aragorn continues to kick BUTT and look great! Arwen, on the other hand...why was she in these movies again? Gandalf continues his non-wizarding, but does have a lot more ""presence"" in this round and actually makes some things happen. The rest of the hobbits also had more to do here and did so effectively. The standout in the cast was Sean Astin though. His Samwise received a greater focus here and he made the best of it. Elijah Wood also continued his compelling work as Frodo, the character with whom we needed to identify with the most. The film's also packed with a number of memorable sequences, most notably the awesome spider-tunnel scene, as well as the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, with the elephant-beasts, trolls, orcs et al, looking to obliterate the good guys.I also appreciated the inclusion of Miranda Otto's character and her fate. Girl power indeed! The ending was also nicely handled (except all the stuff AFTER the ending, which felt out of place), although I still can't say that I was emotionally attached to any of the characters. In the end, I enjoyed the film, but like I said earlier, felt like a lot of it just regurgitated what we'd already experienced in the two previous installments but also inserted enough coolness to amaze those who didn't believe that more ""oomph"" was possible. I haven't read (or care to read) the books, so if you enjoyed the previous two movies, you're likely to appreciate this finale as well, and if you didn't, well...just wait until the longer  version comes out on DVD in a few months and watch it from the comfort of your own living room sofa, your own remote control (with stop/fast-forward buttons) and your own schedule.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3DIKJP95XTKX0	"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley"""	Make no mistake, I think with the first two films Peter Jackson pretty much buried the term 'unfilmable book'. They were two brilliant films and surpassed my expectations. It was with a real sense of excitement that I sat down in a cinema to watch this the third and final instalment, and in a nutshell it was a let down.The issue that makes Return Of The King go wrong is its editing. To cut out the crucial character of Saruman and the role that he plays througout this part of the book and right at the end is probably the most glaring.I would have like to have seen on screen the battle for The Black Ships Of Umbar but it is not there.Another cut is the confrontation between Gandalf and The Witch King at the Great Gate of Gondor. In the book, this was one of the crucial elements of the battle of The Pelennor Fields and its exclusion badly detracts from the menace of the Witch King.Also missing is the showdown at the Gates of Baradur between Gandalf and the Lieutenant Of The Tower which is a crucial lead in to the battle that follows almost immediately afterwards.The ending itself is changed from that of the book so that instead of the enormous black, lightening crowned figure of Sauron filling the sky, we have the Eye in the Tower only collapsing in on itself which is frankly an anti climax.On a more positive note, the Battle Of The Pelennor Fields is superb with the various armies, The Nazgul dive bombing the city, and The Mumakil crushing all before them.Equally The Army Of The Dead is superbly realised, as is the walk into their mountain city beforehand.Also the restoration of some of the cut scenes is also apparently in the extended version which I have still not seen yet, such was my disappointment with the theatrical release cut....To sum up though this could of and should have been a much better film, it does not compare with the book or the first two films that have gone before.Sorry Peter but it really does not hack it. When it comes time to film The Hobbit, please, please leave the scissors at home!	3.0	Keep those scissors away from The Hobbit!	2005-01-17	6	2	4
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3EJYJC25OJVKK	"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer"""	"Even with a thousand plus word review, I can never even begin to explain the sheer power and the scope that ""Return of the King"" really is. The final chapter in this great and apocalyptic trilogy is by far the darkest and most riveting of the three LOTR movies and in my opinion, the pinnacle of filmmaking in just about every way you can look at it.In this epic finale, Frodo Baggins, his companion Samwise Gamgee and their guide Gollum, also known as Sm&eacute;agol continue on their quest to reach Mt. Doom and destroy the ring by tossing it back into the fiery chasm where it was made. The power of the Ring though has become so strong that it is now causing Frodo's unraveling, his friendship with Samwise is becoming strained from the stress of resisting the Rings power, and Gollum and Samwise are coming into major conflict with each other and Frodo, already carrying a huge burden, has the choice of either going with Sam's or Gollum's advice. However, Gollum secretly has devious plans of his own. Meanwhile, Sauron's massive armies now launch a swift and brutal assault against the Race of Man's remaining refuge Minas Tirith and their remaining king Denethor II, driven mad after knowing of the death of his son Boromir, shuts himself off from the outside kingdom. Sauron is gaining power by every passing minute but the ultimate fate of Middle Earth lies in the hands of one Hobbit, which is Frodo Baggins who is becoming increasingly influenced by the Ring and also is facing decisions to listen to Gollum or his longtime friend Samwise Gamgee who has been coming into fights with Gollum.This movie is the longest of all of the three, coming in at a grand length of 3 hours and 17 minutes but even then, as the movie ended, I did not want it to end. If there is anything that occasionally pokes at my side, it's the omission of Saruman's fate. I originally have passed the news of it off as just media pap but sadly, his demise has been omitted from this movie and I was really eager to see how it happened but we may not be seeing it until the extended edition of this movie comes out. Other than this omission, ""Return of the King"" is just about as perfect as movies can go. This movie blows any of the Star Wars, and Harry Potter movies right out of the water and into orbit around the earth. Those are great trilogies but nothing rivals the multiple dimensions of the Lord Of The Rings novels that Tolkien created. He created entire languages, entire landscapes and different races of human beings ranging from Elves, to Dwarfs, to Orcs, and the Race of Man, along with countless others too.All of the characters were excellent but there are two I especially want to take note of. Samwise Gamgee to me felt more like just a sidekick to Frodo Baggins but on here, even amidst the setbacks he has gone through, he comes off as being every bit a hero as much as Frodo himself. The other one is Miranda Otto as Eowyn. Eowyn, who was asked to stay behind by her uncle King Th&eacute;oden, she however defies orders to stay behind, disguises herself and becomes a woman warrior like no other character in any other movie. I would go far to say that she even beats out Ellen Ripley from Aliens as the greatest woman fighter in movie history.The late 1970s and early 1980s animated screen adaptations of the novels were awful in my opinion as the hobbits looked more like giant coconuts and Gandalf and Saruman looked more like bearded figures from bad Christmas Cartoon outtakes. Those animated versions failed so miserably at bringing the novels to life that they turned many away from the series. On the other extreme, Peter Jackson's adaptation of these three novels though, he brings the images that I had imagined from reading the books right onto the big screen. There are some occasional areas where he deviates from some of the story elements but overall, no movie series has ever been so faithful to their books the way Lord of the Rings has and ""Return Of The King"" does the best job at it.I stated in one of my reviews on the last movie ""The Two Towers"" that that one was what had the most substance of them all but now I have to contradict that as this final epic installment in the trilogy is by far the greatest of them all and not only to best but also the most heartbreaking masterpiece that has ever been made. This whole movie trilogy will never be surpassed again in any of our lifetimes, if ever, and Peter Jackson has already sealed his status as a directing legend. I have never cried at the ending of any movie the way I did with ""Return of The King"". Not even ""Titanic"" from years back broke my heart the way ROTK did. It really brings to mind just the exact things that our world seems to be going through right now, the evil forces of terrorism are moving, corruption in corporations is rampant, and the forces of good who aim to counteract these problems seem to be scattered and in shambles but hope always remains for a better future. As the elves left Middle Earth to the race of men as the Age of Men dawned, I really cannot help but say that if the age of Man continues to this very day, according to Tolkien's timeline, I feel saddened at what man has done to the Earth since the end of the Third Age.Anyhow, go and see this movie. You will never experience moviemaking on an epic scale like this ever again in your lifetime. You will cry, you will laugh, many emotions will come up. I guarantee it."	5.0	Heartbreaking yet awe-inspiring conclusion to LOTR!	2003-12-24	17	16	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1OKMIT8B373YD	djhexane	"But it will not be this day!I just recently took in this picture long after the fanatic crowds had vanquishged themselves from the theatres leaving a few seats open for me.  I was very impressed once again.  The movie began with a flashback of what Gollum used to be, before he was corrupted by the ring and how it drove him to murder to be in possession of ""his precious.""  It was a wonderful change from the computer generated (wonderfully done) Gollum and to actually see the (exceptional) actor behind the hobbit.The rest of the movie goes back and forth between the epic battle and Frodo, sam, and Gollum's journey to the crack of doom.  Both are exceptional done with excellent acting and just plain eye popping special effects.Something I do want to address is the discrepencies between the book and the movie(s).  We must remember that these are movies and movies based on books are more often than not...completely different.  And this case is no exception.  And there were also things that many believe very important parts, that were unfortunately left out.  Examples: Saurumon.  He was a large villianous character in the book.  His turn against the good made a large impact on middle earth and so did his armies.  His fall was never shown (let us hope the extended dvd has it though).  The last scene at the Gray Havens failed to mention the Undying LAnds, where they were headed and according to the book, the ""last"" ship was in fact no the last ship.  But that is no big deal (the last ship thing) its only a movie.  Also the continued movie involvment with Arwen was...interesting.  She was in the book for very little and I don't believe she had *any* connection the the one ring, which would cause he death if not destroyed...what the heck was that all about?!But this was a movie.  If I want the book, I will read the book (which I think I will...once again).  And this is one movie I cannot wait to get on dvd so I can sit around for 15 hours and dissentigrate my eyes.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2WP0GOTX13MG4	"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff"""	'The Return of the King' is the final chapter in one of the most ambitious movie trilogies of all time.  Based off of J.R.R. Tolkien's famous novel trilogy, the 'Lord of the Rings' series tells the story of a hobbit, a race of half-human size beings, that is given the difficult task of delivering the 'One Ring' to Mount Doom so that it might be destroyed.Why is this such an important task you might ask?  Well, the One Ring (to rule them all), was created by Sauron, a being of unspeakable evil.  Long ago, the races of Middle Earth banded together to defeat Sauron.  However, they failed to destroy his ring of power.  Now, Sauron seems to be reemerging, and his minions are searching for his ring to completely restore him and solidify his rule over Middle Earth.In the first movie of the trilogy, 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' Frodo, played by Elijah Wood, the Hobbit accepts the incedible burden of transporting the ring to Mount Doom, where it might be destroyed.  He is joined, amongst others, by three of his fellow hobbits (including, most notably, Samwise Gamgee, played by Sean Austin), Gandalf the Grey (an old and wise wizard played by Ian McKellan), Strider/Aragorn the Ranger (played by Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the bow weilding elf (played by Orlando Bloom), and Gimli the dwarf (played by John Rhys-Davies).  The Fellowship ultimately splits up when they suffer losses and Frodo fears the others in his party will be unable to resist the call of the ring.The story continues in 'The Two Towers.'  Sarumun the White, a powerful wizard played by Christopher Lee, has joined Sauron's ranks and creates his own legions of orcs to threaten Middle Earth.  In this installment, the first large scale battle of the war is seen.  In the meantime, Sam and Frodo contiue to make their way to Mount Doom, but they are being trailed by a former weilder of the Ring, a creature called Gollum.Finally, the story concludes in 'Return of the King.'  Mordor, Sauron's kingdom, has her armies on the move, and Gondor lies in their path.  While Frodo and Sam make their final approach to Mount Doom, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalf, and the other hobits prepare for the climatic battles that will decide the war for Middle Earth...'Return of the King' won the Oscar for best picture.  In some ways, the Oscar was a way of acknowledging the entire series (the other two movies were nominated for the Oscar for best picture as well, but they both lost).  However, this movie was worth of the accolades.  The scale of the movie was immense.  The cast of characters for this series, in which all three movies were shot at the same time, numbered in the thousands.  The action, scenery, costumes, adaptation, and special effects were on par with any other movie.This movie was visually breathtaking.  In one scene, you witness Sam and Frodo escape from a giant spider.  In another, you get a bird's eye view as you follow the trajectory of a boulder as it flies through air and comes crashing down on the unfortunate soldiers and castle below.  Next, you see the might Nazguls fly through the air, spreading panic and raining destruction on those below.  And then, in the climatic battles, you see war craft and monsters of various shapes clash.Fans of Tolkien's trilogy should be very pleased with 'Return of the King' and the rest of the movies in the trilogy.  While not 100% faithful adaptations, most scenes are translated faithfully, or at least in the spirit, of their corresponding chapters fromt eh books.  Thankfully, Peter Jackson, the director (who won the best director Oscar for this film) spared the viewer many of the unnecessary songs that littered the novels, and only included those that added to the ambience of the movie.Fans of adventure and fantasy movies should like this film.  This special edition is over four hours long, so stock up on the popcorn and snacks before you start the movie.  Also be prepared to get up and stretch your legs a bit between disc swaps.  DVD fans will be pleased by the numerous commentary tracks, making of featurettes, and countless other special features.  Most viewers will be able to enjoy the movie, but some smaller children might be spooked by the various monsters and violence.

Knouse	"I have read the trilogy twice, and I saw this film in the theater three times, each instance surrounded by moviegoers completely enamored with everything in this film.  There was communal laughter and even applause.  So I pose the question again: How could anyone give this film less than 5 stars?  This is what all films should aspire to be: extraodinary filmmaking with incredible entertainment value.  I knew, after so much that was in the book ""The Two Towers"" was saved for the finale, that the third film was going to be amazing!  The cast received the Screen Actors Guild award for outstanding performance as a whole, and in the end the film won all 11 Oscars in which it was nominated.  After ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" lost both Best Picture and Best Director(blasphemy!!!), and ""The Two Towers"" was also passed over, it was genuinely surprising to see ""The Return of the King"" showered with Oscars.  As a film on its own, ""The Return of the King"" is the closest to a flawless film since ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in 1962.  There has not been a film series like this, affecting viewers on a cultural level, since the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy.  The visual effects in this film, in particular, are huge.  This film is a benchmark for all future CGI effects.  In a theater setting(first time viewers must see this on a large-screen television) the visual effects are overwhelming.  There was another surprise in the third film that was absent from the first two films: singing.  In the books there is poetry and song throughout and it was a welcome and excellent addition to the epic grandeur of the film.  Without a doubt, this is a 5 star film.  Those who disagree should be subjected to psychoanalysis due to obvious insanity."	5.0	How could anyone give this film less than 5 stars?!!	2004-05-24	5	4	1

I am bleary-eyed from lack of sleep.  My hair looks like an abandoned bird's nest.  I've been wearing the same pair of underwear since. . .Tuesday, I think.  That long-neglected salisbury steak TV dinner still resides in the microwave.Peter Jackson, you have successfully hijacked countless hours of my life with your extended version of THE RETURN OF THE KING.  I know I should complain--complain about the insomnia, lack of appetite, mold in my undies--but can't bring myself to do it.  These four DVDs are a Tolkienite's blissful nirvana, and I, after hours and hours of eager viewing, have only just begun to scratch the surface of their abundant treasures.For abundance is the watchword with this majestic extended version, beginning with the film itself.  Well over four hours in length, we are greeted and treated with exceptional extra footabe.  The violent demise of Saruman and Grima Wormtongue.  A jarring exchange at the Black Gate with the ""Mouth of Sauron"" (oh, for a good dentist).  Brief, fleeting glimpses at the blossoming romance of Eowyn and Faramir.  Frodo and Samwise, clad in Orc garb and deep within the festering bowels of Mordor, suddenly absorbed into a most dysfunctional brigade.And those are just for starters.The extended version of THE RETURN OF THE KING wonderfully and successfully enhances, augments, and improves the Academy Award-winning theatrical release; its special features and enticing appendices make watching this stuff an absolutely unforgettable experience.  As examples:  We learn why the ""Scourging of the Shire"" was not included; how Tolkien himself was influenced by the wanton carnage of World War I; the overwhelming emotions of the actors as they concluded their roles after more than four furious years of filmmaking--heck, we even get to watch a gigantic prosthetic oliphant get made and then transported, piece by piece, via dozens of trucks, to some windblown pasture, where it becomes the world's largest movie prop.No wonder I haven't showered in days.This extended version is the granddaddy of its two predecessors--a shining triumph of entertainment guaranteed to enchant and delight.  Pay close attention to the actors' voice-overs of the extended film; you will laugh, giggle, chuckle (what a witty group they are)--but you will learn, and absorb, a ming-boggling amount of information.

I have loved JRR Tolkien's, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; since my early adulthood (from the early '80s), and Peter Jackson's big screen translation is the one I've been waiting for for more than twenty years. I saw ROTK more than a dozen times at the theatre, and each time I was moved to tears, it was just so beautifully done! My favorite scenes include: Gandalf and Pippin riding Shadowfax to the top of Minas Tirith - the Howard Shore score, for which I can't praise enough in this review, perfectly matched my growing sense of amazement at seeing just how BIG the city really was, and how high up it got - simply majestic; one of my most favorite scenes was the one where Pippin lit the first beacon of Gondor, and watching, stunned, as the incredible score, combined with the amazing aerial cinematography, swept me up and made my spirit soar as the call for aid travelled hundreds of miles through the night across the mountaintops! When Theoden rode before his men, clanging his sword against theirs and their berserker cry of &quot;DEATH!&quot; before charging into certain doom - just thinking about it makes my eyes water! Sam's heroic climb, carrying Frodo up Mt. Doom; the expressions on Gandalf's, Aragorn's, and Merry's faces as they watch Barad-dur fall and Mt. Doom explode; the deep sense of acknowledgment as Aragorn, Arwen, and the peoples of Gondor, Rivendell, and Rohan bow to the Hobbits at Aragorn's coronation; and the deep-felt sense of loss - for an end to the beauty the elves brought to Middle-earth, and for the final ending of the Fellowship, as the last ship left the shores of Middle-earth to take all the Ring Bearers (except one - Sam, who bore the One Ring for a little while) to The Deathless Lands, never to return.I am truly puzzled by anyone who found this film boring (???), childish (???!!!), or anything other than an instant classic and a masterpiece that will light the world's screens for decades and longer. It would be interesting to know just what kind of movies *they* liked! &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; or &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious,&quot; perhaps. I enjoy a wide range of films, from Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, to To Kill A Mockingbird, Whale Rider, Casablanca, and even Fried Green Tomatoes - but ROTK (and FOTR and TTT) are in a class by themselves.

I felt that way when I heard that Tim Burton was going to remake Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. And, I felt that way when I heard that Peter Jackson was going to bring one of my favorite novels to the big screen--J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.It was pretty much a common agreement among fans--The Lord of the Rings would be impossible to turn into a film (or films) worthy of it. It just couldn't be done.Peter Jackson proved everyone wrong.The Lord of the Rings is a perfect spectacle, capturing the essence exactly right. It is sweeping. It is epic. It is personal and touching. It is beautiful. It is frightening. It shows to everyone who'd never be bothered to read such a thing exactly why this story has captivated so many for so long. The casting just could not be better. Ian McKellen owns the role of Gandalf as he seems to own everything he attempts. And Sean Astin as Samwise... well... he's as dynamic and layered as they come. Gollum is, of course, a stunning achievement and wonderfully imagined. The scenes are majestic--the locations, stunning--the score is marvelous. In short, in everything it tries to do, this series of films succeeds and fulfills the promise of one of the best novels of the 20th Century.Sure, not everything is included. There is no Tom Bombadil. There is no ""scouring of the Shire."" But enough is included to feel fully faithful to the novel and, at the same time, do everything that is required of a movie. Further, it's nice that there are still some surprises for those who decide to read the books because they've loved the movies.Episode I was okay (though Episode III partially redeemed the effort). Charley and the Chocolate Factory would've probably best have gone unmade, to leave us with the memories of the far superior Gene Wilder. But in The Lord of the Rings, we have a series of films for the ages, well deserving of the accolades, awards and moneys it has received.Five stars only because that's as high as it goes."	5.0	Fantastic Films, True to Tolkien and His Vision	2006-05-22	6	3	3

I saw Return of the King on a Sunday, following special screenings of Fellowship of the Ring on Friday, and then The Two Towers on Saturday.This last film of the Trilogy, does not disappoint. It ends the Trilogy in a manner that is worthy of the first two films.Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortenson and the rest of the cast fit their characters perfectly. With a cast that works perfectly together, and the amazing direction of Peter Jackson, this is the one movie this year that you do not want to miss.	5.0	Six stars - the best film of th year	2004-02-26	0	0	0

Peter Jackson has done an amazing job bringing The Lord of the Rings to life throughout this movie trilogy. Now, I would recommend you see the first two movies first, because The Lord of the Rings is very complex. This movie consists of amazing battle scenes and is able to produce emotion out of the viewers. (Honestly, I cried at the end).The Return of the King has magnificent special effects, battles, and don't even get me started on musical composition. I would be surprised if anybody wasn't satisfied with this movie. I think you should read the book too, it's a great work of art.So, you heard my review. All there is left to do is watch the movie.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1IHKEK41DDYPW	D. Ragan	The third installment of perhaps the greatest film trilogy of all-time, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King draws the epic journey of the One Ring to highly-anticipated end.Director Peter Jackson displays his finest work to date, as the film flawlessly weaves in and out of different sub-plots while balancing action with dialogue to perfection. Jackson also takes his boldest stab at adapting the LOTR series by straying away from the novel's plot and dialogue more than the other two books. Jackson even took the liberty of adding a different beginning and end to the film.Viggo Mortensen stars as the Northern Ranger Aragorn, whose return to native Gondor is highlighted in the film's title. Although ROTK sets the stage for Mortensen's standout performance, he fails at times to be more eminent than the scenery. When he voices his climactic speech prior to the culminating battle of the movie, one becomes reminiscent of Mel Gibson's riveting performance in Braveheart. Unfortunately, Mortensen comes nowhere near to matching the Aussie star's electrifying deliverance.One of the better performances of the film, however, comes from Sean Astin, who plays Frodo's companion, Samwise Gamgee. Like Mortensen, Astin's character receives a lot more focus in ROTK, but he comes off leaving a lasting impression on the audience. Astin convincingly embodies the courageous and caring attributes of Gamgee so well, that the audience is able to connect with his character the most.While the acting had its ups and downs, the special effects were all around spectacular. The Battle of Pelennor Fields was a true visual achievement, as the armies of Rohan, Mordor, and the Dead clashed in one of the greatest battle sequences ever put on film. The special effects crew also did exceptional work in one particular scene, in which Aragorn summons the dead warriors of Gondor to fight for him. The phantasms of the cursed men were generated with such eerie detail that it intensified the atmosphere with haunting suspense. This suspense, however, was exceeded by the still uncertain fate of the ring.By the time of the film culminates, viewers are left with some sense of fulfillment, whether it be by viewing high intensity action sequences or finally knowing how the epic ends.  Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King fittingly caps off the extraordinary saga that has drawn more attention to the classic novels than Tolkien himself would have ever imagined. If you take away all the publicity, all the awards, all the money; and all the recognition the LOTR films have attained, you're still left with an appropriate tribute to Tolkien's legacy.	5.0	Movie Expert	2004-06-06	1	0	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AF9FVW03AXV6I	dragon_rider	This is by far the greatest ending to a brilliant trilogy. Peter Jackson has created something special that won't come around again agian for some time. The entire cast are wonderful actors and Andy Serkis as Gollum really brings a new age of expression to acting through computer generation. The visual effects are breath-taking, and they do not overwhelm the story like some films ( matrix sequels, star wars prequels ), the effects support the story. To those people who say they don't like this movie because it's too long is just ignorant. If it was to short they would complain.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2A3F3SRHFPQ9E	"""dreg_87"""	It is impossible to fairly credit the genius and masterpiece that this movie is in a few short words. Each movie in my opinion, has been better than the last, making for an epic third movie.To begin with, the acting. People have said that the acting in each of the three movies has never been exceptionall, hence only one Oscar nomination to an actor/actress out of all three movies, (That was Ian McKellan FOTR.) However in this third installment there are several actors who must be recognized for their achievments, namely Sean Astin as Sam, and again Ian McKellan as Gandalf. Sam's incredible acting with his relationship with Frodo draws sympathy and emotion from me every time I see the movie. And Gandalf, with his several stirring speeches, both mostly to Pipin, are a a great acting performance worthy of recognition. Honorable mention must also go to Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Bernard Hill, who plays Theoden extremely well.Next a look at the visual aspect of the movie. In a sense of the natural beauty of the film, it is incredible. All three films incorporate a level of beauty and grandeur hard to find in many films. New Zealands fresh and exotic landscapes are always present throught the film, and can often take ones breath away. One scene in particular is that of the lighting of the beacons, as Peter Jackson takes the viewer on a spectacular ride over snowy mountains and sweeping valleys. The shot itself is not only a testiment to the amazing cinemetography and editing of the movie, but also the amazing beauty of New Zealand that is presented through the entire film.However as with the first two movies, The Return of the King's visual aspect relies not only on New Zelands beauty and Peter Jackson's camera moves, but also upon the amazing digital and visual effects that are integrated seamlessly throughout the movie. The Weta Digital visual effects team that brought to life such creatures as Gollem and Treebeard, have created the benchmark by which all visual effects will likely be judged from here on. Their ability to make a digital thing like Gollem who exists in a computer resonate emotion and feeling is a work of true genius. The visual effects shine not only in the obvious areas such as Gollum, but in the subtle effects that can barely be noticed; shadows formed by digital creatures that aren't there, lighting effects that create a mood in the scene that is otherwise non-existent. All of these things have been worked together so will with the real-time footage and acting, that you end up never knowing what is real and what is digital.Everytime I watch the movie, I never am bored. Peter Jackson has made a perfect blend of drama, emotion, action, even some humor and romance, that the movie never grows old. Scenes such as Faramir's ride towards Osgiliath and death, the charge of the Rohiram upon Pelennor fields, the last battle in front of the Black gate, while Frodo and Sam struggle up Mount Doom, just to name a few, are beautifully done and are implanted in my mind forever.The Lord of the Rings trilogy, which ended with this rousing finale, has created a pop culture phenomenon that will no doubt last for many years to come. If you haven't seen by all means must buy or rent this DVD. If you have, then I suggest the same thing, buy it. You won't be sorry you did.	5.0	A Masterpiece Beyond Description	2004-07-19	5	4	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AW704555R2B2N	Dr Gan T. Pau	"The third and final instalment of the Lord of The Rings trilogy deserves every accolade that's been heaped upon it, and more. It's unbelievably real, brutally honest and instantly memorable. This is a film that will appeal to all types of moviegoers, male or female, young and old, Tolkien fans and non-fans alike.The story was well written and executed considering the sprawling and meandering nature of the book. The strategy of placing Shelob here instead of in The Two Towers was a good one and helped enhance an otherwise lopsided war movie.Three scenes are particularly memorable. Firstly, the aforementioned Shelob's lair where Frodo and Sam battle the giant spider. Secondly, The Battle at Minas Tirith. If you thought Helm's Deep was good, get ready for a jaw dropping spectacular battle scene. Lastly but certainly not the least, a flashback about the origins of Smeagol and how he deteriorates into Gollum. This is an unscheduled and unexpected diversion but it allows us to fully appreciate the duality of the character and provides us with some room to develop a degree of empathy for the creature.Acting wise, I found myself rooting for Sam most of the time. Sean Astin's performance shines above all the rest. Samwise Gamgee's bravura and dedication to his comrade makes up for Elijah's confused and weakened Frodo. Oh and Gollum. I could go on and on about how good Andy Serkis and the CGI team were in bringing to life this awesomely tortured creature but I'll let you fill in the blanks here.Finally, here are a few tips to maximise your enjoyment of this movie or rather event of the year.1. Go watch the first two instalments back to back before going to see ROTK. It helps to jog your memory about the main characters and brings you up to date about where they're coming from. ROTK does not waste time reminding you about anything. It races ahead relentlessy from the word go and doesn't slack off till the end. So you're expected to remember and know who and why the characters are the way they are.2. Read some of the more reliable reviews about the movie first, either online or in print. Spoilers aside, they actually help illuminate some of the more rather confusing plotlines and side developments which is not fully elaborated in the show. (Where's Saruman?) You can't fault Peter Jackson for this. It's already 3 1/2 hours long and he already had chopped off more than an hour from the initial rough cut.3. Bring a hankie. ""Sometimes tears are not itself evil"".4. Lastly, start saving money to get that extended 4 disc version next year. I know I will."	5.0	A triumph of masterful moviemaking.	2003-12-18	0	0	0

Several people I know who had not read the books could not follow the screenplay at all.  Upon further reflection, I realized that although the action scenes were Epic and overwhelming in their intensity, they did nothing to allow you to glimpse into these characters as they were created in Tolkein's books nor did the dialogue allow you to follow the plot as it advanced.  There was not a failure in the epic quality -- there was a failure of genuineness -- if it had hit the mark -- even those who had not read the books would have understood and been able to follow the movies.	1.0	Great BIG Movie -- lots of shortcomings.	2004-07-08	32	9	23

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1TJIJKKN15KR9	drqshadow	For as little as this film has to work with, plot wise, there's really no excuse for how long it clings to the screen. Really, in the grand scheme of things, what does it accomplish? A big battle scene to preserve the sacred city of Gondor, a recruitment drive in the land of the dead to facilitate the former, Frodo and Sam's arrival at Mordor and the big finale at the lava pit. Some exposition can be expected, naturally, and in a few scattered cases it does serve to enrich the extended universe, but for those four primary points to devour over four hours of screen time seems ridiculously excessive.The wealth of character moments on display in Return of the King are generally well done, but rarely do they feel as essential as they did in previous chapters. With very little exception, the primary cast has already worked through their individual arcs before the title card, so there isn't much meat in that respect.As with The Two Towers, the fight scenes (scattered liberally throughout) are appropriately epic and pulse-pounding, though these too push the limits in terms of what the viewing audience is willing to let slide. We're already suspending our disbelief a fair distance in regards to the fellowship's universal fighting prowess, but one particular scene with Legolas and an elephant seems more than a bit excessive. In fact, Legolas is granted an especially silly amount of battlefield respect throughout the series.I could dwell on the negatives all day long - I haven't even touched on the stupid amount of slow motion in the farewell scenes - but at the end of the day, this really isn't a bad film&#8230; just a madly bloated one. It's thoroughly rewarding to finally conclude our journey with the residents of Middle Earth, and when the plot finally gets around to waving goodbye it's a powerful experience. I just can't help but wonder how much better a slim two-hour cut, trimming off half the body fat of the original, would play to the same material. Oh, and its status as a Best Picture winner? Clearly that was a lifetime achievement award for the trilogy at large, because The King is far and away LOTR's weakest installment.	3.0	Effective But Bloated, The King Could Stand to Shed a Few Pounds	2014-01-05	2	0	2

It is still a very good story in it's own right, and adding the extra only enhances the experience.One can go on about the story, the characters, etc., but I wanted to focus on THIS release.  I love the movie.  I think it is one of the great epic films of all time.  I find it uses technology and the skills of many arts to tell a story so that they never seem to take it over.  It is in that aspect that I wanted to mention what I found to be a flaw in this release.&#60;Possible Spoiler Warning&#62;A brave captain heads back out to confront the Orc army on a suicide mission.  The Steward of the Throne of Gondor has dinner, and asks his new &#34;Guard of the Citidel&#34; to sing him a song.  As the song begins, (at least on the DTS 6.1 soundtrack) a high piched artifact can be heard that was noticable enough to pull me out of the film and look for something wrong.&#60;End Spoiler Warning&#62;With the exception of the disk switch (I wish there was a DVD standard to automatically swap disks on DVD changers) no other part of the film ever caused me to be distracted.  The sound in question is on the high end of the audible range and may not be noticable on all but the finest equipment or by those with a more restricted range of hearing.  Certainly it does not cause any major problem, it is simply an annoying noise that I found broke the immersion of the moment.I also found that I needed to boost the rear center channel a little, but that could have been more to the fact that there is very little 6 channel source out there and I might not have had it well balanced to begin with.  This was not something I found in watching the film, but in using a selected scene before I settled in just to verify the sound settings were balanced.  This is more of a personal choice than a technical one.  To be honest I don't remember any spectacular rear center moment, which is exactly what you expect as it should just enhance the show before you, not having you look all over the room.Peter, go through your soundtrack with a better ear.  One such audio glitch really does have an impact when it pulls the audience out of what is otherwise a very dramatic and emotional moment in the film.	4.0	A standard to which all movies should strive	2004-12-22	7	2	5

For not all tears are an evil.""And it's of tempting to weep as the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy draws to a close, with the ""Return of the King."" Peter Jackson's brilliant adaptation ends the classic fantasy epic with a bang... but then quiets down to let us bid farewell to these lovable characters. Astounding direction, action, and a little pang when it's all over.Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realizes his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel on his own.Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring -- and its power over him is growing.The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.And in this movie, Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in ""Two Towers"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In ""Return of the King,"" Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene is a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other, such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into rich movie dialogue.Elijah Wood gives an unparalleled performance as Frodo Baggins -- it's hard to imagine any young actor in recent memory who has given a performance this wrenching. Frodo's deterioration is horrifying to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the ""strong"" hobbit, demonstrated in a tearjerking scene as they scale Mount Doom.But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the ""I'm going to take care of you"" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen and McKellen are astounding as the kingly outcast and the kick-butt wizard, while Miranda Otto, David Wenham and Bernard Hill are brilliant on the sidelines.Perhaps the most striking thing about ""Return of the King"" is the final fourth of the film. While the ""multiple endings"" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.""Return of the King"" brings the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is the best of the ""Lord"" films -- and that's saying something."	5.0	The story ends	2007-12-09	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ACCZJHQKB7S9A	Ebony Reviewer	This thing is about 25 minutes toooo long.  The ending just drags on forever.  It could have stopped at the wedding scene.  There are parts in the middle that need to be cut, they add nothing to the story and seem to be just left in as filler. I saw it twice, didn't really like it 100% the first time and truly disliked it the second time. The CG and other special effects are too obvious, and at times I felt like the story was just meandering all over the place.  When you compare it against the first movie it defects just glare at you.	3.0	It's toooooo Long	2004-04-15	22	7	15

There were so many parts of this movie that I considered my favorite.  For me the ending was the best because it was complete.  Many times in books and movies it doesn't end like you may want it to.  In the end of Return of the King the uniting of Aragorn and Arwen was special.  Love ususally ends in sorrow but not in this case.  The ending was one I could live with.  The hero is said to be Frodo.  But he doesn't share the title alone.  If it wasn't for Sam there would be no Frodo.  Sam was the real hero to me.  Legolas was the most beautiful elf I had ever seen.  Orlando Bloom congratualtions on being born with excellent genes.  The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is the first set of movies that I believe are worth the price of the ticket.	5.0	THE BEST EPIC ADVENTURE EVER MADE	2004-01-05	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1R2URG8OHNEDS	"Ed Mich ""Ed"""	For those of you who read my reviews, for the last two years I have reviewed the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movies once the DVD cames out so I could review both. &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; came out earlier than the others, maybe because it won Best Picture at the Oscars this year, but I am still going to review both the movie and the DVD. I could start off by saying this is one of the greatest movies of all time, and it is the best of the three. The DVD is loaded with special features, but it could have more, and the features were not satisfying. The movie is visually stunning, filled with special effects, but some of the dialouge is corny, and certain speeches could drag on for a while. The musical score isn't genius, and didn't earn the Oscar for it three years in a row, but it does have a good theme, played during the battle sequences. &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; is a great finale for a trilogy that started with a little dull, but ended grand.The movie starts off with Smeagol, a hobbit, whose discovering of a very powerful ring, caused him to turn into a creature named Gollum, who has a good side and a bad side, both telling him to do different things. Gollum is helping the hobbits Frodo and Sam to destroy the ring many years later, by bringing it to Mount Doom where it was made. Frodo intends on destroying it, but Gollum has plans of death. Meanwhile, other hobbit Pippin has found something that makes Sauron think he is in possession of the ring, causing the wizard Gandalf to bring him to safty. They go to Gondor where Gandalf learns about Frodo's quest and how he isn't dead. Orcs under control of the Dark Lord are coming to destroy the city, and warrior Aragorn, elf Legolas, and dwarf Gimli set out to get the dead to help the people. King Theodon goes to Gondor with an army, and orders his neice Eowyn to stay behind. She dresses up as a man, and takes Pippin's friend Merry to fight in the battle. Finally, Aragorn's true love Arwin, who is an elf, wants to be a mortal instead of the ability to be immortal, so she could be with Aragorn. The war is only in the beginning of the end, and the fight begins.&quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; did not deserve the Oscar for Best Picture, a statue that should have gone to &quot;Mystic River,&quot; but it was a great movie to watch visually, but the acting and the dialouge is nothing to rave about. It won a total of 11 awards, but it doesn't mean that it earned them all.The DVD is pretty good. It has alot of stuff, but the good in dept making of stuff is going to be on the December release of the extended version, with about 45 minutes of scenes not in the theatre release inserted into the movie, with a new score. The DVD has three &quot;in-dept&quot; making ofs called &quot;A Director's Vision,&quot; &quot;A Filmmakers Journey&quot; and a National Geographic special about the movie. It has featurettes that first made an appearence on the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; website, only six of them on this DVD. It has the trailer and television commericals. Finally, it has a look at the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; video game, which is coming soon.This is the longest of the movies, at a total of 200 minutes, which is a little over three hours. People say that movies like &quot;Troy&quot; and &quot;The Passion of The Christ&quot; are violent, and those are only Rated R. This is rated PG-13, and it is the most violent PG-13 movie I have ever seen, even more violent than &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.&quot;To end my final review on the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; DVD's, I have to say that as one big movie, it is a masterpiece. I was not a fan of the first movie, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; only giving it four stars. The final two were great, at five stars, and these movies cannot be remade, because they are one of a kind. The special effects are a wonderm and no trilogy of movies can compare to this. Not &quot;The Matrix&quot; movies, and not even the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; movies. This is a great movie, and if they ever re-release it, go see it because it is better in the theatres.ENJOY!Rated PG-13 for intense epic battle sequences and frightening images.	5.0	The Final Chapter!	2004-06-24	6	4	2

Tolkien's own introduction in which he denounces his work as an allegory. Such nitpicking on a remarkable achievement in film, storytelling, set design and ensemble acting is in my mind unfair and elitist. No film-to-book adapation is ever perfect, and people need to get used to that fact. Peter Jackson accomplished something insurmountable with grace, style, and flair...that achievment should not be ignored or cheapened by pseudo-intellectual hogwash.	5.0	To Bill Faith, the one-star guy	2004-12-18	9	8	1

I bought all versions of the VCDs and DVDs for both fellowship of the rings and the two towers. And, after watching for I donot know how many times, I still feel the thrill and the suspense of the movie. I think this movies should be rated more than 5 stars! Though many details were taken off in the screen adaptation, still the realization of such grandeur epic is just too wonderful to be missed by anyone who loves fantasy. I was no tolkien fan, but believe me, I am totally swept off my feet when it comes to The lord of the rings. lastly,I just couldnt wait any longer for the last installation of this amazing trilogy.	5.0	The movie that really deserve 5 stars	2003-10-29	160	70	90
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A9Y6B6OWUNHEW	Elisa Maza	"I was crying when the movie ended and for so many reasons. This movie is easily the greatest and most powerful of the three movies in Peter Jackson's future classic legacy ""Lord Of The Rings"" and will go down into the same category as ""Wizard Of Oz"", ""The Godfather"" and ""Citizen Kane"" as one of the greatest movies that has ever been made.Perfectly picking up where ""The Two Towers"" left off, Frodo, Sam and Gollum are approaching ever closer to Mt. Doom in Mordor but Frodo is falling further and further into despair as the power of the Ring is increasing. Meanwhile, Gollum has some nefarious plans of his own that they aren't aware of yet. Meanwhile Minas Tirith, the capitol of Gondor, is under seige by massive armies loyal to Sauron and the dark powers are spreading all over Middle Earth, causing death and destruction in the process.Time is running out, friendships are tested, powers both good and evil, start breaking down, armies start moving, and the days are growing darker as the fate of Middle Earth hangs by a thread.This movie is extremely intense.Arguably the darkest of the three, this brings the epic trilogy to a powerful and tearjerking end.I cried not only because of the powerful ending but because a great era in moviemaking has come to a conclusion.But we will someday see this again on the big screen someday and perhaps the extended editions back to back. We'll see....Until then, go and see this movie right away. You will never experience anything like this again."	5.0	The best of them all!	2004-02-14	207	167	40

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A8VCQPQTR8APD	Eliza	Before I saw this movie I've heard a lot of good things about it, so I must say that my expectations were high. Usually, when I feel like that the actual thing turns out to be worse than I expected. But ROTK didn't let me down. It was merely awesome! The cast was so well-picked, that there wasn't a slightest doubt in my mind that nobody else could've done a better job. Especially to me stood out Sam and Pippin. Billy Boyd just blew me away with his performance and how he showed the arc that Pipin's character had overgone.Elijah Wood has done his job well also. He managed to capture both the evilness of his ring-possessed self and the pure innocence of his old self.Visually the movie was captivating, the scenery and battles were grand and beautiful. And as bored as I usually get while watching the battle scenes, the ones here had nothing extra that would make, me at least, go to sleep.The plotline was very intruiging, but rather sad at the middle. I cried at least 5 times during the movie, and that tops all other movie I've watched.So, now I can only add, that this is a great movie, definatly one of the best movies made so far!	5.0	The Grand Finale	2004-04-22	4	3	1

I usually do this one when I am taking off my hat) -- on and on!Despite not having read the books in high school, I found the first three films absolutely riveting and well done.  My husband (who had read the books) also agreed and found the movies, for the most part, closely aligned to the book content.  The latter movies (Hobbit, Des. Smog), however, we both agree, have fallen prey to the Star Wars syndrome -- great effects, overproduced action scenes, sillier characters and dialogue, weaker plot and character development.  As per my husband, he found the more recent films to be quite overstretched  (particularly knowing that there are two more movies still), and the introduction of characters, etc. that were not at all in the book to be too much of a stretch of &#34;artistic license.&#34;  The kids will definitely love the newer films anyway, and we will most likely see the ensuing out of curiosity but without high hopes.Hope that helps!	5.0	I am now a Lord of the Rings Fan.	2014-01-04	0	0	0

I laughed, I cried, I held on to the edge of my seat, my heart sank, then soared.  It was like have every human emotion put on the spin cycle. I saw it twice and I am dying to see it at 100 more times.  And I am an adult who knows how overpriced movie tickets are!I don't want to give away anything to someone who hasn't already seen it but this movie brings closure to everything left hanging in the last movie.  I hadn't read the last book yet because once I saw the first two movies, I didn't want to spoil the surprise of the end.  I was glad I waited because I feel like I truly felt the way Peter Jackson wanted me to feel while watching it.The Aragon/Legolas/Gimli storyline was wonderful but I feel like there will be even more on the extended edition that I cannot wait to get. The Elrond/Arwen/Aragon story was beautiful and touching. Frodo/Sam/Gollum - one comment - I love Sam!  He is the best of what is good in the world.  Merry/Pippin - made all hobbits and men proud. Gandalf, Elrond, Theoden, and Galadriel kept things on the right track guiding the men (and women) to fulfill there destiny. Eomer and Faramir, brave warriors til the end.  And of course Arwen and Eowyn showed they were more than just pretty faces.Also, if you are the least bit sensitive - take a tissue.  If you are like me, take a box.  I spent the last half of the movie crying.  The complete stranger beside me thought I had lost my mind.  So did my husband though!This movie trilogy is the best movies of all times.  Peter Jackson is a genius.  The cast is so wonderful.  The makers of this film make you feel so drawn to the story of these people and you want to be there beside them fighting the Orcs or walking through Rivendell with them.  You fall in love with all of the men because no real men are truly that loving and in touch with their emotions. And only a man that looks as good as Orlando Bloom could make pointy ears look good - Spock from Star Trek could never pull that off! This movie is about good vs. evil and you can't beat that!  It makes you feel like a kid in a fairy tale again.  If Peter Jackson and this movie do not win every award available at the Academy Awards - it proves that the people who judge that award do not care about what people who watch it really think.

Matthews	"I have to disagree with another viewer who claimed the series doesn't capture the spirit.  I think that term is tossed around lightly by people who have no clue what it means.I have heard several people make this claim and then give specific examples of how the movie doesn't follow the exact events or some of the main characters do things differently or have been moved.  You can definately see some interpretation of the story That's plot not ""spirit"".Things were definitely changed throughout the series, characters left out, some fleshed out more, events moved to other ""books"" or changed, dialogue put in the mouths of other characters.  Watch some of the excellent commentaries included in the extended version DVD's and you will even get to hear some of the reasons behind these choices.This is simply the best DVD series ever made for a book translated into film.  You don't have to agree with the choices Peter Jackson and his writers made, but you do at least get to hear about those choices from them in their commentaries.  Nearly an hour of extra footage is included in this beast of a movie- complete with integrated musical score.  This was a labor of love, no one can refute that.The Spirit of the story is completely intact.  The messages are conveyed.  Middle Earth has been brought alive.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2VKUKPP10BT3Y	E. M. Collins	first off, this is a great dsc, but....I liked the EE of FOTR and TTT much better than the theatrical editions. The other EE's were made in away that improved pacing and filled out the story. ROTK just dosent have that quality as much. It feels forced in places, and some new scenes just dont do much for the story and/or are just in for comic relief- blowing out the ghost hands like candles after they appear to be pulling legolas down to the ground? come on!It also comes off as just too long- and I love long movies! The other EEs did not come off as longer, just better. That is lacking here. Some of the new scenes interefere with the pacing, such as the new battle scenes, i liked the theatrical version better.that said- there are some major improvments:voice of saruman scene was a great improvment. true, he didnt die in that manner in the books, but with the scouring of the shire scenes not in the movie, saruman didnt need to survive till the end, and that was a good way to close his a wormtongue's story.the added dialoge at the paths of the dead and the taking of the corsair ships were  great additions,as was the mouth of sauron. CREEPY!! some people have said it was unneeded b/c we the viewers knew frodo was still alive, but its not about the viewer- its about adding doubt to the minds of aragon and friends and the effect the mouth's claims have on them. they dont know he is alive. This is a attempt by suaron to fill them with doubt and despair, and our knowledege that frodo is alive is irrelevant.one final gripe- eowyn goes from talking to theoden just before he dies and looking pretty much fine (all things considered)  to half dead on the ground when found by eomer. Way to much of a jump, I thought i'd missed something. If you are not well versed on the books this is confusing, as the scene presupposes that that the knows that she eventually goes to the houses of healing.overall I'd reccomend ROTK EE, it's just not as good as the other EE s, but still agreat way to kill 4 hours.	4.0	not quite as good as other extended editions but still great	2004-12-20	7	4	3
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1D7X0XJAI6YC7	Emilie	"Allright, to begin I would like to make clear that there IS an existing ""Return of the King"" on VHS, but it is certainly not by Peter Jackson. It is a cartoon version and is, beyond ANY doubt, the WORST movie I have EVER seen. So please, do not blame poor Peter Jackson for the mess up. Now, if you enjoy listening to terrible ballads about ""Frodo of the nine fingers, and the ring of doom"", and the thought of a studdering hideous Sam, who uses his entire hand to cover his nose, is funny, than I highly recommend it. On the other hand, if you want to see a movie that even REMOTELY resembles what Professor Tolkien wrote, than PLEASE FOR YOUR OWN SAKE wait until Peter Jackson's version comes out in December (which will bypass pretty much EVERYONE'S expectations, I'm sure of it)."	1.0	Return of the King	2003-03-20	83	9	74

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1655SGPPUUCRP	Emily Todd	"""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is an extraordinary work of art.  Never in my life have I experienced such a stunningly beautiful, mesmerizing, passionate and moving film.  ROTK not only entertains and moves us; it shows us what greatness humanity is capable of.  Everything about this film is perfect.  And I mean that.I'm going to have trouble putting into words exactly what I feel about ""Return of the King"".  It's beyond words; indescribable.Director Peter Jackson's masterpiece is an example of what movies can really do.  Every other film I've seen pales in comparison.  From the sweeping aerial shots of battle to the tender bonds of friendship shown between Sam and Frodo, nothing even comes close.  One can only imagine what Mr. Jackson and co. went through to get these films made.  If this man does not win the Oscar for Best Director (and Best Film), I will loose all the respect I ever had for the Academy and their authority on film.The astounding ensemble cast is unparalleled in cinematic history.  Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Arwen, Galadriel, Elrond, Bilbo, Faramir, Eowyn, Theoden, Eomer.  Each one of these names draws to mind an incredible story.  An incredible character; so real you feel a pang within your heart when they suffer or happy to the point of tears when they triumph.  Each one of these characters will forever be embedded in the hearts of moviegoers worldwide.This is such a visual film.  The cinematography, in conjunction with Howard Shore's stirring score, is simply the best I have ever seen.  Jackson doesn't use his sweeping camera views just to impress us, each frame helps add to the story and the overall emotional impact.Oh, the emotion!  Never in my life have I been so supremely moved by a film; a book, an image, a song.  This is more than characters sitting around crying over each other.  It's more than you could ever imagine!  I don't know how J.R.R. Tolkien ever envisioned such an epic and poetic story.  There were so many moments in this film that brought me to tears.  And I'll have you know, I cried straight through the final 30-40 minutes of the film.When the credits began to roll, I remained in my seat, saddened.  Tears silently trickled down my face.  The journey has ended.  There is no more to come.  After ""The Fellowship"" and ""The Two Towers"", we knew there was something more to come.  Now there is nothing.  As I walked out of the theater, I felt as if I were bidding goodbye to old friends.  Farewell; you will all remain forever in my heart."	5.0	The Journey Ends...	2003-12-18	3	3	0

As a movie, it's top-notch. A thrill ride from start to finish, and there are moments where even the greenest Tolkien fan will weep at the beauty, the majesty, and the humanity of these characters, given breath so well by our beloved LOTR players. It's an action movie, very much in the vein of The Two Towers, only more so. Action, action, and more action. It's also a love story in the vein of original Tolkien, both romantic (Aragorn and Arwen) and staid friendship (Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam). This is indeed the last big bang that we have been waiting for. I don't watch movies again in the theatres, but I'm going back for another round of this one. You'll cheer, clap, and cry your eyes out. But be warned, purists: this is Tolkien at high speed. Yes, it is three-and-a-half hours long, but even with that length, chapters get removed, and other chapters get extensively abridged. Don't forget, this is moviemaking, a different proposition entirely from the authorial arts. As to the abridgments and omissions, don't forget-there's the extended version coming, and that should be PRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECCCCIOUS...	5.0	Excellent Film, but Be Prepared for a Reader's Digest ROTK	2003-12-18	1	1	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ATN1GKB3XZ3G9	"E. Palladino ""epalladino"""	"Reading ""Lord of the Rings"" for the first time at around 16 years of age was for me a seminal experience.  The impact of the work was so strong that I read the books three times in a row before I completely digested the enormity of this masterpiece.  Much of who I am today was formed from how that first reading made me look at myself and look at life.  Since that time I've read the books more than 30 times.  Each re-reading has deepened my appreciation of Tolkien, but the joy that I felt when reading the work for the first time is something that I thought would always be in the past.When I first heard about the Jackson films I was both pleased and anxious.  I was pleased because I love movies and have always looked forward to someone attempting a filmization of my favorite author.  Of course, I was anxious because any adaptation of LOTR would probably not be good enough (recalling Bakshi's attempt in the late 70s).When I first saw Jackson's ""Fellowship"" I had to watch it about 3 times before I could rid myself of my own idea of what a Tolkien film should be like. After this happened I realized what a great film this really was.  My experience with ""Two Towers"" was that I was so upset with the choices that Jackson made that I only watched it once and have yet to discard my disappointment with the film. However, I am planning on seeing it again when I purchase the DVDs (extended, of course) of all three films. I am pretty sure that several re-viewings of the film will also rid me of my disappointment with it.My more recent experience with ""Return of the King"" was a bit more complicated. On first viewing I liked it way better than ""Two Towers"" even though I was disconcerted with certain plotting choices and spent a lot of time arguing with Jackson (in my head, of course) while watching the film.  However, at the point in the film when Bernard Hill as Theoden was giving his big speech to the riders before their charge, suddenly something clicked for me that hadn't clicked in any of Jackson's three films until this point--Jackson somehow managed to distill in this one moment everything I loved about Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"". I started to cry, not so much because of how moving the scene was, but because Jackson managed to make me feel exactly the same ecstasy of emotions that I only had been able to feel when reading (and re-re-re-reading) ""Lord of the Rings"".The first time I saw ""Return of the King"" I had (literally) to run out of the theater the minute the credits came up to be on time for a choir rehearsal. I really did not have time to completely digest everything that I was feeling about the movie. So I decided to go and see the film a second time. In the past, when I had re-viewed ""Fellowship"", it was after I had purchased the video. This was the first time that I had returned to see one of Jackson's films at full price at a theater (which is now $10.25 in most NYC theaters). This second viewing was an eye-opener--not only did I feel the same emotions during Theoden's speech, I felt these emotions during the whole movie regardless of changes in plot or character.  I also started to forget that these people were actors in a movie and started to feel for them as if they were real people with real problems. This is the first time that this has happened with a fantasy, or science fiction, film.  I even went to the film a third time (still at full price) just to see if it still made me feel the same. It certainly did, only even more so.I have now come to the conclusion that Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" films (not just ""ROTK"") are among the greatest movies that were ever filmed.  Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" films are perfect in way that Tolkien's books themselves were perfect. Which is not to say that the films (or even Tolkien's books for that matter) are without flaws, but that the films (like Tolkien's books) are masterpieces that reflect much of the mind of their creator.  The fact that Jackson is not Tolkien (and visa versa) means, at least to me, that rather than a mere filmization of the work we have two completely separate, if at the same time completely related, works of art.Both are masterpieces, and while it is true that Jackson's films could not exist without Tolkien's books and the primacy of creation goes to Tolkien, Jackson's powerful vision gives something back to Tolkien. Having seen and loved the films I will never be able to read Tolkien in the same way again.Peter Jackson in ""Return of the King"" has done the miraculous--he has made Tolkien new for me again."	5.0	Jackson made Tolkien new for me again	2004-02-14	7	7	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1OG9NVWPCR2AV	E. Powell	As the third and final installment in Peter Jackson's directorial magnum opus, The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is a must-have title--if you already own the other two. Like its predecessors, it is a very long film that could easily be shortened by 45 minutes to an hour without losing anything from the plot. Yes, it's a visually stunning interpretation of a classic piece of 20th century literature, and it deserved the 11 Oscars it won, including best picture, but at almost THREE AND A HALF HOURS it's just too darned long. I mean, just how many monster battles does one need to sit through to get the point? If you're totally into that kind of thing, then this is your all-you-can-eat buffet. For me, the best thing about having it on DVD is the pause button, because you can periodically get up to relieve yourself, of fix a snack, or even have a life while watching it. Taking the thing in at a single sitting isn't just a pastime, it's a commitment.Of course, we haven't even mentioned the second disc containing several hours of bonus features yet. They're great, by the way, and there's a lot of them. One thing that can definitely be said for this package is that if you like the content, you more than get your money's worth.Amazingly, there is actually an extended version of this film available that has a running time of more than four hours!!! Now that's the epitome overkill, both literally and figuratively.	3.0	A modern--albeit lengthy--classic	2008-08-22	1	0	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK	"Eric James Cooper ""ejames43"""	"Peter Jackson saved the best for last.  Return of the King is a masterpiece of filmwork.  Tolkien created this amazing work of art decades ago, and Jackson had made it his own. Three and a half hours never went by so quickly before.  What you get is the perfect combination of storytelling and special effects with acting so spot-on that you will be compelled to both laugh and cry.Sam and Frodo continue their quest to reach Mt. Doom to destroy the One Ring.  The weight of that burden grows heavier with each step close to Mordo.  They are guided by the creature Gollum, who has plans of his own for the ring. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, and Andy Serkis are all particularly amazing in their roles, but it's Astin who really shines.  His performance is worthy of and Oscar nomination.Meanwhile, Aragorn still struggles with his own would-be destiny as the heir to the throne of Gondor.  The action that takes place in Minas Tirth and Pelennor fields is mind-boggling.  If you thought Helm's Deep was good, you haven't seen anything yet.We catch a glimpse of Smeagol as he once was.  We see exactly what the ring did to him, and from this we feel a sad sympathy for him as we experience his torment.Much has been said about both the length of the movie and the omission of Saruman.  I'll address them both.At 3 1/2 hours, it is epic, but truly this movie could have easily been four hours.  The story is so large in scope that it would be a crime to try to cram all of the information needed to complete the tale in less time.  Everything is finalized as it should be, and the end is more than satisfying.Saruman's omission seems jarring in theory, but Jackson's point is well taken.  The story has to move on, and wrapping up Saruman's tale would have slowed the movie too much.  He will reappear in the extended edition DVD, and then we can judge whether that part of the film should have been kept intact.A word about the missing ""Scouring of the Shire.""  I actually enjoyed this part of the book very much, but for this movie it would have been very anti-climactic.  I didn't miss it, but Tolkien purists will debate this one for years.Odds and endsShelob is incredibly realistic and frightening.  The scenes with her are very tense and well crafted.  Jackson did well to place her into the third film rather than the end of Two Towers.The Witchking of Angmar and the Fell Beast are incredible in their wickedness.The Paths of the Dead was placed into the film rather well, given that it really isn't written about at great length in the book.Return of the King is given even more power by the resurgent role of Gandalf played by Ian McKellan.  He was underused in Two Towers and his beefier role here is for the better.This trilogy is one for the ages.  Given the legendary status that the books already carried, Peter Jackson had a lot to prove to the purists while making the movies enjoyable for the casual fan.  He succeeds in both arenas.  He has become one of the foremost directors of our time, and I think his Oscar is due this time around."	5.0	Amazing.  Stunning. Jaw-dropping!	2003-12-19	3	3	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC	Eric J. Anderson	The virtues of this part of the trilogy are the same as the virtues of the first two parts. Superb acting, visuals, and of course Tolkien's story.However, this last effort had too much action for action's sake. This left less time for in-depth dialogue. The interaction between characters was left to the minimum, lowest common denominator stuff. It is in this film especially that a bigger dose of Tolkien's wordiness would have been welcome. Less action, more talk. I suppose Jackson was unable to resist the temptation to try to compete in spectacle and unrestrained busy-ness with other contemporary action films. Pity. LOTR is so much more than that. Or it should be.Also, the emotional peak of the film is the coronation of the king, and particularly his showing honor to the four hobbits. The two epilogues following this were not necessary. The ending therefore is strung-out to no good purpose.These flaws could be fixed in the directors cut, but I doubt they will be. If Return of the King could be made more like Fellowship of the Ring, then this trilogy would be an unqualified success, and I would pronounce it the greatest epic film ever made. But they dropped the ball at the last. I think it was fatigue on Jackson's part. He lost sight of what he'd done in the first two that made them so magical.Still, a trilogy must have an ending, even if it is somewhat flawed. I will wait with faint hope for the director's cut.	3.0	Scripting/editing not up to previous standards	2004-06-12	6	3	3

Schechter	"I saw the film on December 4, 2003, in Minneapolis; Barry Osborne had arranged a screening to benefit Carleton College, his alma mater.As with the others, I looked forward to this movie--wouldn't miss it for anything--with the repeated thought, ""Don't let them mess it up; PLEASE don't let them mess it up.""  I should have had more faith.  Peter Jackson didn't mess it up.  I recommend it wholeheartedly.It starts with the backstory of Smeagol and Deagol, telling the tale of the evolution of Gollum. It continues to highlight the character as even more manipulative than he is in the book.  I found Gollum's increased influence and a few other changes in detail confusing at first, but these things did serve to heighten the suspense for one who already knows the story well.  Of course the movie has to omit things that were in the book; time is limited, after all.  But these necessary changes were handled in a simple and elegant way, making the flow of the story smooth and impressive.  This film is extremely heroic in theme and action; as a result, some of the subtlety of the earlier movies is lost in the more direct appeal to the emotions of the viewers.The acting was. as always, excellent; in particular, Billy Boyd gave depth to the character of Pippin far beyond what he was called upon to do in the first two films.  David Wenham (Faramir) also was outstanding.I liked it very much.  Most likely, if Hollywood runs true to form, some other movie will win the Academy Award for best picture.  But Return of the King actually IS the best picture of 2003, award or no award."	5.0	I have actually seen the movie--VERY MINOR SPOILER	2003-12-10	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1Y5QQ1J5YYMP0	Essie	"After seeing the first two films, I had high expectations for this final chapter in the trilogy. These were far exceeded, however, when I saw it for the first time on opening day (Dec. 17th, 2003). Jackson's adaptation of the Return of the King is probably the closest to the original book plot of all the movies yet, with relatively few big deviations. Scenes such as Faramir riding to what he thinks is his death to try to gain a tiny bit of respect from his father Denethor, Sams courageous fight with Shelob (a giant spider) in order to save Frodo, or Eowyn standing up to the King of the Nazgul (the ringwraiths) to protect Theoden, struck me as being nearly perfect adaptations of the scenes in the books, and where both emotionally stirring and visually appealing. Sure there were a few minor aspects that seemed a little corny, like the spotlight effect to show where Sauron's eye was looking, but the positive aspects of the film outwieghed these drastically.Needless to say, the special effects in this film are completely astounding. Everything, from Shelob, to Gollum/Smeagol, to the battle of the Pelennor Fields, is incredibly detailed and believable, which really allows you to be sucked into the story. In fact, when I was watching the Return of the King in theaters, a man nearby was so utterly absorbed in the film that when Frodo was being stalked by Shelob, he cried ""Watch Out!"" before realizing that he was actually in a theater, and Frodo couldn't hear him. An especially impressive CGI shot is a scene on the Pelennor Fields where Legolas (the elf archer) climbs up a charging mumakil (basically a giant elephant) to get to one of the Haradrim leaders (a force of men that is fighting for Sauron).This is probably the best film of the trilogy, since it is more emotionally driven than the others, while still having the great plots and special effects that made the other ones wonderful. Though it is nearly three and a half hours long, the whole film goes by amazingly quickly except at the very end (the movie only felt like it was a little over an hour for me), which shows how absorbing the movie really is. Jackson has done a wonderful job writing and adaptation for this classic series, keeping most of Tolkien's themes alive while making changes to the plot (as any film adaptation most do). In fact, Tolkien himself even said that if a movie were ever to be made of his works, the plot would have to be completely changed from his writing! How nice to find that he was mistaken in this aspect. This is definitely one of the great movie trilogies of all time and I would recommend that everyone see it (except, please, please don't bring your small children to see it in theaters as it can be frightening at some parts and it is 3 and a half hours long after all)."	5.0	Amazing!	2003-12-18	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1E2CSVDYFJLLM	Eva Sepeda	Like Peter Jackson (or whoever it was) said, &quot;In this film, every character has to face their ultimate challenge.&quot; This is very true. Aragorn has to learn that he must take responcibilities as a king, Frodo must destory the 'One Ring' before it destorys him. It's all a very high special effects film, but lucky for Peter, it didn't go too far. This movie will capture your imagination and make you wonder if there really was a middle earth, if there really was 'one ring to rule them all', if there were really orcs and wizards and...well you get the picture.The story continues as Frodo and his companion Sam travel to Mt. Doom to destory the One Ring that has started to unfold an undestoryable evil. I don't know if most people realize it, but Sam was actually the one thing keeping Frodo from turning back. And without Sam, Frodo wouldn't have made it anywhere with just Gollum. Speaking of which, Gollum (as you know) has a split personality. One side is the kind, 'mustn't hurt master' Smeagol. The other half is the 'precious' side other known as Gollum. But since everyone...especially Frodo, knows the power of the ring, it takes over Gollum and makes him...well...Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimili, Gandalf, and all the other important/half important people must defend the city of Minas Tirith. Reason being is because...well you watch it for yourself and see why. At first, I didn't really know why either, but that's why I watched the movie again.The one thing I didn't really appreciate that well is that Gimili and Legolas and Eyown's (or however you spell it) brother (whatever his name is) don't have much of a say in anything...especially Gimili. If you watched the first and second LOTRs, you would notice that they all each talk about the same as the main characters (Aragorn, Gandalf, King Theoden). But in the third one, they really don't talk at all. Mainly because it's centered on the main people in the movie, Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo and somewhat Sam. But the special effects, the tearjerking scenes, and the breathtaking music really make up for it, to me at least. I don't think any other director, other than Peter Jackson, could have captured such a famous, epic book into an epic, 12 Academy Award winning movie. You should listen to the critics on this movie, it's a must see..if you haven't already seen it.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -P&gt;S&gt;If you've seen the movie...listen up, because if you haven't seen it, you won't understand what I am about to say/type/whatever. I didn't notice this at first but when I did, I was surprised. Well, in the beginning of the film, when Merry and Pippin are singing their little drunken heads off, watch the guy that gets the drink spilled on. If you'll look at him and some old lady a couple of people to his right...or left, you'll see that they're not really looking at Pippin and Merry. Which means that Pippin and his drunk friend aren't really there. I guess it was computerized so they would look short. Probably a green screen.Second, and last, of all, when Aragorn and King Theoden and everyone else reach that camp place in the film with that mountain with those green, dead guys, watch how Argorn looks into the cave. As you can tell, he is looking (or at least thinks he's seeing) somthing. I looked too but didn't see anything...that is until I bought the movie. If you look really close while is shows the cave and the movie is playing, you'll see the leader of the green ghosts that Aragorn comes across when they enter the cave thing. Here's another way to do it: Right before Gimili comes along and tells Aragorn, &quot;Let's find some food.&quot; (when the camera is on the cave entrance for the last time at the last second or whatever), pause the movie to where it still shows the screen. Now look closly and you might see it a little better. Or you can just put that scene in slow motion to see if you can see the ghost...wow that was confusing.If you already knew about this, then congrats, you knew something I didn't know about the movie. But if you didn't know it until now, then I guess I helped you out now didn't I?	5.0	The Best of Them All	2004-07-04	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1W0BW0PC0EAHX	Falcon42	Jackson's epic trilogy's conclusion sadly failed to deliver for me. Having read the original Tolkien works naturally set immense (unachievable?) expectations of any attempt on film. The first film I considered a super effort - true to both Tolkien's word and vision. Unfortunately I fear the cinematographer in Jackson overcame his vision of Tolkien's work, and much of the subtlety and nuance of the (lengthy and detailed) story of the Lord of the Rings was lost.For instance, literary scholars have often commented upon Tolkien's personal distaste for the impact of industrialisation upon the natural environment - a strong theme throughout LOTR, with the forces of good closely identifying with nature (elves from the woods, hobbits of the shire, even wizards that can talk to birds and trees) and of course Saruman's industry representing the force of darkness (destroying Fangorn, building weapons of war, etc.). In the written work Sam is given a gift by Galadriel in the first book of a small box filled with earth from Lothlorien and a single Mellon tree seed (the huge trees where the elves live in Lothrorien), which he carries with him faithfully throughout their quest and 'reseeds' the shire when the hobbits return home right at the end. Indeed each of the characters of the fellowship all have their own substantial tales to tell, and in my opinion many of the right seeds were sown in the first film. Sadly the character progression ebbed in The Two Towers, though a visual treat it was indeed.The third and final chapter sadly fails to deliver the full payload for each of the characters which makes the real depth of the original work and has maintained its high popularity and appeal. Jackson had the opportunity (and the expectation) that making the three films in one go would facilitate delivering on long story arcs spanning the three chapters, which it did cinematagraphically, but sadly not on the character front.Too much time is spent revelling in the back story of Smeagol/Gollum, whilst the focus on other important characters (the fellowship plus Eomer/Eowyn/etc from Rohan) was blurred.Reading this back I feel rather harsh as Peter has succeeded in the best effort ever to represent on screen the best selling book of the twentieth century, second only to the bible.Maximum use is made of superb New Zealand countryside, and technology is truly used complementarily to best tell the tale.Whilst it would be impractical to seek to tell all that resides in the extensive books, this rendition fell short of telling enough to give satisfaction.In some respects I think that even what was sought to be told lacked the careful thinking and planning evident in the first film and felt rather hastily assembled and lacking soundness. Fingers crossed the extended edition does a bit more justice. That said I don't think we can expect to see the scouring of the shire or the political changes in Gondor (I weep that PJ failed to deliver the party under the new tree planted by Sam when they return back to the shire the year after Bilbo's party - that would have crowned the piece in so many ways).Well worth a punt if you've not read the books, but if you buy this note that I hope it encourages you to buy the book to get the real full value of the story of the one ring!	3.0	Good show, but...	2004-01-23	16	0	16

But when I saw the first movie I had to read the books. And I am glad I did. Alot of movie based on books are made to the one who is making hte movies interpretation. These 3 movies couldn't have been made any more closer to the book. There was only maybe 2 major changes that I saw. When I read the book I didn't have conflicting images in my head of what the actors looked like and what I saw the chars looked liked. They matched perfectly. This man didn't jsut make a movie or 2, he made an entire world come to life. There is nothing I would have changed, and nothing more good have been added. Good job peter. you will go down in history for the love of these books.	5.0	Nothing better	2004-11-23	14	7	7
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A150QZUUQAN21X	Fallout Girl	"Like all Tolkien fans, I had once been afraid of this. I had been afraid that our beloved books would be taken by a talentless, indifferent hand and thrown into the horrendous money-making machine. I had been afraid they'd be ground mercilessly and without any consideration for J.R.R. Tolkien's work or for its fans, ground into pieces of overbudgeted FX with not much else left to the eye and to the mind.What we got instead was nothing short of a masterpiece. Hype? Sure, there's been some hype. But The Lord Of The Rings has rendered the word hype obsolete. It takes that hype and smashes it against a wall of pure brilliance. The final installment is a glorious ending to a trilogy that decades down the road, I have no doubt, will be hailed as one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema. Had I written the review right after seeing it, it would've probably consisted of one word. WHOA. But I'm OK now. I'm fine. I've taken my Advil, drank my three cups of coffee, got good five hours of sleep. I'm OK now. I can finally sit down and write a coherent review.On the other hand, do I dare? What can you say about a movie which is, for the lack of a better word, perfect? I know, I know. Of course, no movie is perfect. But this one is as damn well close to perfect as it gets. I've been literally put under a spell, very similar to the one that had seized my mind 18 years ago when I first read the books. Flaws and lowdowns? Sure, there are some, but only if you choose to be a grumpy purist who refuses to get it through his head that literature and cinema are two very different media and therefore cannot be the same, will never be the same. This is as great an adaptation as there will ever be. Call me when you make a movie one-tenth this good.In my eyes, the films are in some ways better than the books. I find it extremely annoying that Tolkien's work is being idealized by his fans. He was but a man and he, too, made mistakes. His books, as detailed and amazing as they are, still aren't perfect. There are characters who do nothing but sit around, scenes the very presence of which is meaningless or at the very least questionable. Think Arwen, think Tom Bombadil... who, while making a part of the story cool and magical, bears next to no impact on the story as a whole (of course, ""true Tolkien fans"" will probably have my head if they read this, but oh well). But above all, it makes my blood boil when I hear things like ""a true visualization of Tolkien's Middle-earth it is not"" (sic. Rogert Ebert). With all due respect, who in the world do you think you are to decide what a ""true visualization of Tolkien's world"" is? No one but Tolkien himself can give us the true visualization of his world, and he's been dead for decades.Peter Jackson & Co had a task in front of them akin to dragging a cross to the top of Golgotha, in metaphorical terms. And, by all that's sacred, I cannot see how a filmmaker could succeed more in such a task. It is no small feat to accomplish what they have accomplished. Not only have they succeeded, they have exceeded all my expectations. You can see and feel with every shot that this is a labor of love. That goes for everything and everyone in the movie. Cinematographically, it's amazing. The FX were just enough and never cheesy or unnecessary. The score moves you deeply - even the normally annoying Enya did not bother me this time. The acting was splendid, and the cast was simply perfect. I grew up with the characters in my heart, and now they finally have faces. I mean, how many times do you actually read a book, imagine the characters, and then see the movie and realize that the characters look eerily close to what you've imagined them to look like?I could go further into details about this particular installment, but I don't think Amazon supports reviews that long. I will simply say that I have never been one of those never-happy purists who nitpick even on the quantity of leaves on trees in Rivendell. I believe these movies should be seen for what they are, not for what they are not. Don't sit there and compare it to the book, or complain how something was added or taken away. Know this: if you want to see Tolkien's Middle Earth, you never will. Only Tolkien himself could give you his Middle Earth, and he's long gone. Look at these films from an overall point of view and try to see that it is simply impossible to film such a leviathan in a way that will make everyone happy. And for what it is, this trilogy is a rare gem. It combines end-of-your-seat action with heartbreaking drama, and brings intensity on both visual and emotional levels, which few films have accomplished so far. For me personally, it was also a memorable experience because I got to share it with a hundreds of moviegoers who sat in the theater with me for three years in a row. We watched in silence, lest we miss anything. We wowed at the sight of the dark, vast Moria, the surreal beauty of Rivendell, the fiery grandeur of Mt. Doom. We laughed at the hobbits' painfully sweet naivet&eacute;. We clapped at the grand finale. We couldn't hold back tears in the last few minutes before the credits rolled. We were there, with them, sharing this timeless tale of friendship, destiny, love, the loss of innocence and the reign of good vs. evil. Sounds trite, I know. But this is probably one story where it's not.Your mileage may vary."	5.0	As close to perfect as film gets	2004-12-07	106	97	9

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1UCA1NHSWRVFD	"Fantasma 240 ""fantasma240"""	First, I'll start by saying that this review is not for fans of the original books by Tolkien. They will approach these movies in a different way than the rest of us, regular cinephiles or moviegoers, who didn't read those. I mean, for them is a whole other experience, since they are already familiar with the plot and characters and situations, so they will like the movies or not on their own.I will address, as I said before, the rest of us. I had seen the two previous installments and liked them both in some ways. I even tried to watch The Two Towers one second time and found it a bit tiresome. But, that was me.And then... this one. When I got to the theatre and the movie started to go, I found myself less and less interested in the characters and situations, and by half the movie, the trilogy's visual atmosphere had already worn out. For starters, this movie is almost the same as the previous one: one Frodo complaining all the way about the ring, one loyal Sam, one treacherous Gollum. But also, one good vs evil epical battle that seems impossible to win firsthand, one heroe against incredible odds, and one beautiful Liv Tyler that you don't really quite get why is she in the movie for.You seen it before, all of this, now, this 3 hour elephant will give you all of this, all over again with one inmensely boring epilogue, which got even fans of the films to say that it should have ended quite earlier.Scale does not always work for the best. This is not a great epic film, and frankly, after this one I finally turned the whole trilogy down. I am almost sure, that, like those Matrix movies (which are far worse than these, I'll reckon) LOTR won't pass the test of time like the Star Wars originals did, or other great epic films.Once again, for the Tolkien fan, this does not apply, I can basically understand their rejoice in movies they have been imagining for years, and I respect that. But for the casual viewer, beware, there is nothing you haven't seen before (except for that horrible ending, that is).	1.0	If you've seen The Two Towers, you've seen this already	2004-05-27	56	15	41

This seems like a fair statement and a good system of measurement to me. That being said, The Return of the King is a great movie. Not because it has three great scenes and no bad ones, but rather because it has about ten great scenes and no bad ones.I loved this movie. I can remember back to when I was 16 years old (so long ago :p) sitting in the theater with a few hundred others, watching this movie, soaking it in, and loving every minute of it. I loved it! Loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it. It exceeded my expectations. Heck,it demolished my expectations and built a whole new set. There were so many things that I loved about this film, I can't even go into detail about it, because it would be incredibly boring for you, the person reading this. However, let me say this: The Return of the King is my favorite film.Why?Because of the emotional punch it has. Because of the depictions of heroism and sacrifice. Because Sam carries Frodo to the top of Mount Doom, and because Merry rides into battle certain he's going to his death. ""Sure"" you say, ""but I've seen dozens of movies like that."" Yeah, and they all come off as incredibly cheesy. But this one doesn't.Think about the scene in which King Theoden leads his riders into battle, with them all-bravely and guilessly- shouting ""Death!"" as if it were the greatest honor they could achieve. There's something about that scene, when the music rises, and the men, the niece, and the hobbit, all shout the praises of their battle, that just sends shivers up your spine. And, in my case, tears to your eyes.But I can't prove my point by eluding to scenes. I can't prove my point to you at all. Not until you watch it for yourself. I can only encourage you, to plead with you, to watch it. If you haven't seen it, go see it now. If you're a fan of the imagination; of themes of sacrifice, loyalty, bravery, heartbrack, loss, redemption, you will love this movie.

First off the new scenes (like the other two but more so with the first) improve the film. It is easy to see that for the most part time was the reason for deletion. The final confrontation of Saruman was wonderful. As was Aragorn talking to the Eye before the battle, a scene with Aragorn and group taking the ships (and killing Peter Jackson) was silly and didn't need to be included, as well as take away from the impact of seeing the dead in action later. All in all the new scene are wonderful and the film is better for it. I will go so far as to say that all three could be a bit longer adding scenes that were shot that include more details from the books. Would should understand that just because there were three books, doesn't mean to say that there should be 3 films,one can't simply have a neat package of 3 if there's more to tell.

Hey, for those who can't handle emotional endings (or the lack of an intense battle scene right at the end of a movie), just shut your dvd off (when it comes out of dvd) right after The rescue of Frodo and Sam.  That should make you happy.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AU16CSB5S8NH0	Frankie	The Return of the King is by far the best movie I had seen in a long long time. I cried many a time and sometimes laughed through my tears. The emotional rollercoaster that is the Return of the King is truely an expierence that you just cannot pass up. Pippin, played by Billy Boyd, wrenched my heart when he sang the Steward of Gondor. Also, the true hero to the story is Sam,played by Sean Astin. When Frodo tells Sam to go home was another heart breaker for me and I cried till he found Frodo again. I must also give credit to Merry (Dominic Monaghan)because his bravery in battle was extremely noble. Gollum was an extremely important character in the trilogy, hard as you would like to hate him with all of your soul. However, without him the Ring never would have been destroyed. I must also say that if anyone was perfect for the role of Aragorn it would be Viggo Mortenson. Enough said, for he was THAT good. Gandalf remains the voice of truth in the trilogy. The humor that Legolas and Gimli bring is truely laugh out loud competition. All in all, I would have 2 say that anyone who doesnt see this film has lost out on a masterpiece.	5.0	ROTK....worth your while	2004-04-24	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1W1VG5905ERTL	Frank Moore	"I'm going to start this review by saying that I never read the Lord of the Rings as a kid (I was preferential to the Dragonlance novels) and my experience reading the Hobbit gave me the impression that Tolkien was an over-wordy image relater, not a storyteller.  However, when I finally did read the books, I realized was that Tolkien's challenge was that he not only had to tell you the story, but he also had to explain the setting for you in detail because he was, in essence, starting a genre of writing.  Let's face it, bookstores didn't have science fiction/fantasy sections when he wrote these books 50 years ago, they have them now as a result of his creations.  Now, back to the movie review.Much like Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, Return of the King is an adaptation of Tolkien's works.  If these movies were made in strict adherence to the original novels, then each would have been a tedious, 10 hour-long musical - something Hollywood never would have green-lighted in a million years.  Peter Jackson and Barrie Osborne should be commended for taking the whole of Tolkien's story, including the details in the supplemental works, and using it to create a story that flows with characters who invoke a cathartic response from the audience.Speaking of the audience, I'd like to point out a significant but often overlooked fact to all of the Tolkien purists out there: a distinct majority of the people who paid to see these movies never read the Lord of the Rings books and don't care that Tom Bombadil and the Scouring the Shire were omitted or that elves arrived to fight the battle at Helm's Deep instead of at Minas Tirith.  As Jackson was spending someone else's money making these films, he needed to deliver a finished product that would produce some sort of return on investment.  Thus, we have the versions which were released in the theaters.And while those films were good enough for the mass audience (Return of the King did happen to win this little award for Best Picture), I would urge everyone and anyone to purchase the extended editions of the films, especially anyone who, like myself, walked out of the theaters after Fellowship of the Ring or the Two Towers shaking their head and muttering obscenities at Jackson and Osborne due to the ""liberties taken with the story"".  The additional footage (almost an hour and half over all three films) will restore your faith in the filmmakers by adding a depth and detail to the stories that, for whatever reason, the theatrical releases could not."	5.0	Titanic undertaking, awesome results	2004-12-08	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2MRZPTMYFADUV	Frodo	"I am still recovering from my uncontrollable tears which flowed from my eyes 2 months ago. It was an experience i dont think i will ever forget. ""The Return of the King"" is simply the most brilliant film i have ever seen in my lifetime. And coming from a movie critic such as myself, you must understand the rarity of my enormous praise.Not once are do you see a flaw in its absolutely revolutionary visual effects, and never do you find yourself looking around at the movie curtains, as you are absolutely captivated in the world of Middle Earth as you experience, Arwen's sacrafice, Aragorn's bravery, Sam's loyalty, and above all emotions that stir in your hearts, the absolute heartbreak and pain you feel for Frodo, the ring-bearing hobbit. For the final quarter of the film, my tears were for Frodo and Sam as i urged them with my every strength, so that they can at last be ridded of their most evil burden, the One Ring.The musical score is the most moving of the three films, for it is the most personal when it desribes Frodo's utter angst towards the ring, and espeically the mind-gripping battle sequences (the biggest ever seen on film), where ""frantic"" music is played. Sometimes the beautiful harmonies of the ""string"" instruments is enough to throw you into an emotional disgrace! It happened to me!It is a very great shame, that i am unable to reward this film with SCORES of stars, for there's is just not enough in this world that can describe the SHEER brilliance of this film.WIth already 4 Golden Globes, and dozens of other awards, i am praying that this film is blessed with the Best Picture Oscar as it is truly deserving of such a high honour. ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" will without a second thought be dubbed the most phenominal picture ever created.Please without hesitation see this truly remarkable film. Take a tissue - in my case a box, and be utterly mezmorised in the magical world of Tolkein!"	5.0	we've come to it at last...	2004-02-14	2	2	0

To see a creature so young, innocent, and beautiful corrupted so horribly is heart-wrenching, even if you're not a dedicated Frodo fan...Anyhow, don't be dissing my boy- Frodo has no hope whatsoever, and only Sam's love for him keeps him going.Again, it's terribly sad, so be prepared next December.~~~Frodo Lives~~~	5.0	Don't be dissin' Frodo...	2003-01-03	26	6	20

This is completely different than the end of the books.  It actually takes about 4 chapters of the book and squishes it into 10 minutes of movie that does not really reflect the book.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1G9FX1KV45N41	Gary Selikow	The stunning finale to the Lord of the Rings trilogy is simply mesmerizing. It simply awed me being transported into Middle earth in such a way.. We can fully experience the danger and pathos experienced by Frodo (Elijah Woods) and Samwise (Sean Astin) as they travel through the depths of Mordor, needing to survive Orcs, the giant spider Shelob, and the scummy Gollum (Andy Serkis).The movie actually begins with tracing the story of Gollum, the foul murder he commits to achieve the wring, and how he becomes the creepy wraith that lives underground.The movie also explores in depth, the torment of Arwen (Liv Tyler) and her decision to surrender her immortality for her love for Aragorn, who despite being the heir to the throne of the Dunedain, and the messiah of mankind (of sorts) on Middle Earth is a man nonetheless. This is portrayed in conversations with her father, the great elf lord, Elrond, and her visions. The Battle of Pellenor Fields and the siege of Gondor, where Gandalf (Ian McLellan) takes charge of the troops, Aragorn's feat in recruiting the dead men of Dunharrow, and the charge of the Rohirrim, give us a feel for the heroism of the West, fighting for all that is good against the dark forces of Mordor (Orcs, Trolls and evil men , as well as yet other darker more powerful creatures such as the Nazgul and their terrible flying steeds). It is indeed vital today, to give us the fighting strength, to defend our Western Judeo-Christian civilization, against the forces of Communism and Islamic Fundamentalism, and it rung a cord with me, the chilling parallel, as the forces of darkness moved forward , against a fearful and resolute West in Middle Earth.Granting us the straight perhaps, for our own fight for good. No room for moral relativism of Middle Earth. Saruman tried that, aided by the Noam Chomsky-like Wormtongue and was destroyed.	5.0	Stunning Finale	2004-01-23	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AK7D1BHZOSOL1	General Pete	"OK my thoughts on this movie1. Battle sceans were fantastic2. Most of the acting was incredible3. Cinenatoraphy was excellent4. A good book was ruinedPoint 1-There comes a point in every movie going experience hwere you just have to bow down and thank god for computer generation.  If you thought the battle for Helms deep was cool wait until toy see the Battle of Palenor Fields(for those you that haven't read the books that's the battle in which the King of Rohan dies)The army of the dead was a wonderful touch as well.  They get the award for best single moment in the entire series when you see these guys just pulling an elephant to the ground all on their own.Overall the battle sceans are why you should see this movie if nothing elsePoint two-Most of the actors were great it was great to see Viggo Mortensen's character(Aragorn) getting off the fence and deciding to embrace his destinyIan McKellen as always provides the central rallying point in his movie the Christ figure of this series he is able to rally the men of Gondor when all hope seems lost.  For a second there I actually felt that I was on the front lines with the men, it is a rare movie that can do that for me.Orlando Bloom also kicks some major [rear].  The rational parts of my brain know that the fights have been chorigraphed heavily but whenever he fights it is like watching a ballet dancer.John Rhys-Davies also provides a heartfelt and lovable, yet hammy performance as Gimli the dwarfMost of the others proformed maviliously well however there are times when one must be realisticTwo things that ticked me off-The freaking melodrama and the fact that the hobbits(by which I mean Sam and Frodo) looked like they were going to cry half the time.2 did not preform so wellLiv Tyler's performance is probably the most hyped in recent memory.  She is only in the movie for 20 flipping minutes I'm sorry I just don't get it.  I don't get the hype or the love interest or the stupid elven ballads that seem to erupt from her mouth without warning.Elijah Wood in my humble opinion cannot act his way out of a wet paper bag.  I want to love this character but how can I do it with an actor like Elijah Wood?  If his acting does the job for you though please take no offense.I will say this for every single one of the actors-They make you believe in the character weather or not the acting is good or bad.  I found myself rooting for Sean Austin especiallyPoint three-CinematographyThis will totally blow you away no it's and or buts about it.  It is as impressive as the great job that was done on ""Master and Commander""Point fourI understand that a movie is a movie and a book is a book and I understand that there are time constants but to show the Hobbits going back to Hobbiton and having nothing change, no ravaging of the shire no final resolution of Saurman left a very big hole in the entire experience for me.  Oh well that's what deleted sceans are for."	5.0	Great movie, let me break it down for you	2003-12-31	2	0	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3KZC2TLRZLOA0	George Beahm	Earlier this year, on Oscar weekend in Hollywood, where I attended the INTO THE WEST party, a large-screen television had been set up so all the party-goers could watch the Oscars, in between oogling at the Tolkien art show with originals by Tim Kirk. As THE RETURN OF THE KING won in every notable category -- an historic 11 Oscars -- it was clear that this film delivered, as director Peter Jackson promlsed, the emotional payoffs set up in the first two films.Not content to rest on his laurels, Jackson, who has said repeatedly that he's not a fan of director's cuts, affirmed his great interest in extended DVD sets, because it allowed him to offer an expanded version and the back-story as well. For most, the expanded version is enough; the back-story material is there if you want it.As with the gift editions of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and THE TWO TOWERS, Jackson has put a lot of thought in assembling this final piece in his film trilogy. Certainly the extended DVD is reason enough to buy the film, but the gift set is for those Tolkien fans who want more -- much more; if you don't find it under the Christmas tree, buy this set for yourself because it's money well spent.Beyond the two discs, with multiple commentaries, that comprise the extended DVD itself, the discs three and four comprise the back-story and supplemental material, as was the case with FELLOWSHIP and TWO TOWERS. In addition to the four discs, there's a bonus disc focusing on Howard Shore and his magnificent soundtrack; and, appropriately, the Minas Tirith sculpture (with hollow base, for keepsakes) by Sideshow-Weta is the ideal choice. (Among Tolkien collectibles, the Sideshow line stands alone in terms of quality and value. No question, Sideshow's line of LOTR sculptures, busts, and helms are accurate reproductions, beautifully sculpted, carefully painted, and are welcome additions to any Tolkien fan's collection.) Included only in the gift set, a coupon that allows you to buy the companion sculpture by Sideshow-Weta, Minas Morgul.As far as DVD sets go, the LOTR extended sets have raised the bar in terms of customer expectations. Woe be to the film company that produces a DVD with no imagination, for the fans will notice. New Line Cinema and Weta teamed up to produce DVD sets that, with extended footage, deepen and enrich the viewing experience. (If you want to be overwhelmed, see this film on a 42-inch plasma television screen.)At the San Diego Comicon, where Sideshow-Weta premiered the Minas Tirith statue for this gift set, and where New Line Cinema offered a preview of the additional footage, the fans responded very enthusiastically. I will not spoil your enjoyment of the new footage, but suffice it to say that it does does indeed deepen and enrich a film masterwork.The passion and the attention to detail that has been lavished by New Line Cinema, Sideshow, and Weta have combined to give the Tolkien film fan the final piece, as it were, in the impressive edifice Jackson constructed.There is no question that if you saw THE RETURN OF THE KING that you should buy the extended version on DVD; the only question that should be answered is simply this: Which edition? For my money, THIS is the edition of choice; and for your money, buy this edition, as you will have no regrets.October 2004 marks the 50th anniversary of the publication of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING in the U.S., from Houghton Mifflin. Next year will see the continued celebration worldwide, as new editions of Tolkien's classics find their way to bookshelves everywhere. But, unlike the various book editions, there are only two editions of the Extended DVD of THE RETURN OF THE KING. Buy whatever you budget can afford, but do not miss the crown jewel of Jackson's triumphant film adaptations.	5.0	The crown jewel of the Tolkien/Jackson film trilogy	2004-10-01	16	14	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3NN4RTUN0LHBN	George Rownd	This is a great film like all the others and deserves some awards, but I have a few problems with it. Like one, after watching all of the lord of the rings, it seams that all the main characters are imune to dying. They've been in all those huge battles(that look great) but never get touched. Sauromon(or however you spell his name) isn't even in this film. In one seen where pippin holds that crytal ball thing, he looks like his having a seizure or something and it is really funny. If you haven't seen the first two, this film will be full of laughs to you. When the orcs attack minis trinith, they are all of a sudden there. You really lose track of time in this film too. In one scene, where pippin is singing and there showing a battle between the orcs and the kins sons, all you see is the orcs shoot arrows. You don't get to see the outcome of the battle.

He knows how to get the story of the Lord of the Rings on screen without cutting to much ut from the book, but keeping the key parts in. I have read and reread the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and know it in side and out, and I think Peter Jackson along with Fran Walsh did an excellent job installing the final installment to Tolkien's trilogy. He knows how to keep the veiwers interested and on the edge. The actor's performances are outstanding. This is an outstanding performance of the cast and crew of Lord of the Rings. They have proved that the amazing Trilogy of Lord of the Rings isn't unfilmable, like Tolkien said.

Decker ""colonelrambo396"""	"I'll give this one three stars-- mainly because of the inexplicable divergences from the book.WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD1) The encounter with the mouth of Sauron.  Aragon doesn't kill the Mouth of Sauron in the books.  I can think of no reason why he should do so in the movie.  It was a pointless hollywood-isation of the original material.2) The Drinking game.  Couldn't they have come up with a better way to illustrate the friendship between Gimli and Legolas than to stage a drinking game in which Legolas utters the anachronism ""Game over?""3) Denethor:  In the books, he was strong willed, perhaps even a little pig-headed.  He was mad with grief and despair.  In the movie, he's more blood-thirsty, and the reason for his despair (he has a palantir stone in the books, which he used to view only what Sauron wanted him to see) is ignored completely.4) Faramir:  In the books, he is stronger of will and nobler than Boromir.  He turns Frodo loose without bringing them to town.  In the movie, he drags Frodo and Sam out of their way to Gondor, only realizing his error once the Nazgul arrive and he is scared into letting Frodo go.  The character is substantially weakened, in my opinion.5) The dismissal of Sam.  Sam and Frodo entered Shelob's lair together.  There was no intrigue by Gollum to get Frodo to send Sam away in the book.  And everything we learn of Sam's character in the movie says that he would never have simply left Frodo, even if Frodo demanded it.Aside from these changes, the movie holds up well.  It's not the rollercoaster that it was in theaters, for which I am grateful.  The Extended edition makes vast improvements over the Theatrical release, but it remains the weakest movie of the series.This is not to say that the movie is on down there with Godfather III and Return of the Jedi in terms of disappointment.  Make no mistake:  This is still a great movie.  It is but nit-picking to assert otherwise.Let's just hope that Peter Jackson doesn't pull a Lucas in 20 years."	3.0	Weakest of the trilogy	2005-01-20	23	7	16

Is it possible for every nanosecond of a film to be unique and peerless and perfect?My friends, yes, it is. ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" while near-perfect, had its moments that I had thought to myself might have perhaps been done differently. ""The Two Towers,"" while being good, still had moments that should have been done differently. But not ""Return of the King."" No. This movie, nay, this masterpiece of cinema, comes near hair-width of perfection.Of course, the siege of Minas Tirith was amazing. None but wunderkind Peter Jackson could have put together such an amazing, epic, heart-wrenching visual masterpiece. You truly, truly feel these people's passion as they fight, not for money, or glory, or gain, but for simply the ground that they walk on. They fight not for king and country, but for their families and way of life. It's all there.And with all the special effects, one might suspect that characters would be left in the cold, or even forgotten. Fear not, my fellow Rings fans, the characters only become richer in this last installment. Frodo and Sam's beautiful friendship only becomes more heart-rending as the treacherous Gollum tries to pry his slimy fingers between them. Truly, it's the hobbits that are the true stars of the movie, with the elves, dwarves and humans taking a more 'back seat.' But don't worry - they all get their share. And Gimli utters perhaps the BEST LINE in the whole trilogy. To those who have seen this - you know what I'm talking about.And the ending? It brought tears to my eyes. You'll just have to see it.I am still stunned that this movie was so...so GOOD! There's something for everyone here. I, as a fan of the books and an English Major, appreciated the storytelling and character. I had taken my little brother to see it, and he loved the great action and adventure. And my mom, of course, thinks that Aragorn is the hottest thing in this world. [I'll take Arwen any day. :-)] This is the best movie I have ever seen. And, I can say with a fair amount of confidence, that it will remain the best movie for a long, long time.Peace"	5.0	(insert random exclamatory praise here)	2003-12-21	12	11	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2AA5QXMKYLTMT	Gin	"I have seen comments where people are wondering where the full screen version of this movie is. Whether there is one or not of these 3 films, why would anyone watch anything but the Widescreen Version? The Widescreen version of this (or any other movie) is much better than the full screen versions. You get to see the entire picture as it was intended and as seen in the theater. Full screen is cutting out 1/3 to sometimes 1/2 of the full picture! Are the screens in the theater square as is your television? No, they are rectangular, as is the Widescreen version. Many people believe that the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen is cutting out the top and bottom of the picture. So untrue! Another term for Full Screen is ""Pan and Scan"". That means they take one scene and scan it from side to side so you can see what is going on, but only when the scene calls for a certain section of the full picture. Choose any movie you want and watch the full screen and widescreen versions and really look at them. View the top and bottom and sides of the full picture and you will see what you are truly missing. I tried to watch Fellowship in full screen on Starz once, and only once. I couldn't even get to the point past the fireworks at the party because there was so much of the full picture missing. It's a shame. Those of you that are die-hard Full Screen - Pan and Scan addicts, please give the Widescreen versions a try. If you watch them with an open mind and not freak out because of the black bars, you will have a much more enjoyable movie experience! That goes for almost any movie where you have the choice! If your argument is that your tv is too small - it's not an HD tv or something - the size of the tv isn't what is important - it's whether or not you are seeing the entire picture. I watched FOTR and TT on a 13 inch tv once in widescreen and I loved every minute of it! Granted my big living room tv is better, but even on a tiny tv, full screen just wouldn't cut it! I'd rather watch a true theater version than a tv version anyday! :)"	5.0	Widescreen is the ONLY way to watch these movies	2004-11-29	9	6	3

When wehave forsaken our friends and break all bonds of fellowship but it is not this day. This day we fight!""The magic of this movie is that each of the central characters matter deeply to the viewer and to the story.

It is humanity itself making the bittersweet pilgrimage to redemption.The challenges of making a movie based on a well loved book are obvious. Readers of the trilogy already know how the movie ends.They can look forward to savoring every precious page brought to life.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A21XVS00AIENLX	"G. Jennings ""G. J."""	The most fascinating part of the DVD is actually the amount of work that was put into cutting, editting, re-arranging -- my God.  You really get a sense of the pain and agony the entire crew went through to make such a movie.  Time's running out and more changes are made, more cuts have to be editted.  I'm sure there had to have been times when the crew wanted to go at each other's throats and have a word or two with their director.  I'm not in the movie business, but can truly empathize with what it's like to work with a huge team on a big project with a short, short deadline coming up and the huge, huge pressure to do well.But truly, all that strain and hard work was worth every second and it showed in all 11 Oscars the film rightfully garnered.  After watching the special features on the DVD, I can honestly say that Peter Jackson and WETA has honestly earned my respect and changed my view of the Hollywood crowd.  These folks really did give Lord of the Rings everything they got, and it will pay off for decades to come.Tolkien would have been proud.	5.0	Best Work of Art to Date	2005-01-07	11	10	1

Kroener	"Now, first of all, I have to respond to the people who compare these films to Star Wars or even The Matrix (""were they released as books 50 years ago, they would be praised as the greatest trilogy of all time""). This is ridiculous. The Lord of the Rings, and Tolkien's work in general, has a lot more depth to it than the Matrix and Star Wars ever can dream of. And George Lucas himself said he was influenced by Tolkien, so what are you all talking about?As for the Academy Awards: well, Return of the King is simply better than the rest and it fully deserves every single Award it received. That's it. Accept it or not.Then the movie itself: it's all about the siege of Gondor and Frodo's final journey into Mordor. The  two main themes of the film are death, despair and the consequences of war.I don't want to spoil the movie, but it has quite a few surprises. The end is bittersweet and true to the book.What else can you say? It's three hours long, but very well paced. The effects are superb as usual, but they come second to the story. The acting is brilliant, every actor totally transforms into his character.The sound is amazing and Howard Shore pulls off the best of his three scores.What's left?

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AA3HFFNJCFXI4	G. Laur	I won't ever forgive Peter Jackson for this.  The overweight bespectacled New Zealander had extremely humble beginnings making nasty little black comedy horror films on shoestring budgets in New Zealand.  In their own way, they were wonderful.  Then, Jackson started to deviate towards what he considered serious filmmaking, and made a bloated ass of himself.  He capped off this depressing downward trajectory by assembling a huge cast and crew to attack and bastardize a beloved fantasy classic.  Today, Jackson can be spotted with an enormous gut, thick glasses and unkempt facial hair rhapsodizing about himself and what a genius he is.Lord of the Rings could have been made into a cinematic fantasy classic almost worthy of Tolkien if, say, Terry Gilliam had been the director.  Unfortunately Jackson, a small-scale filmmaker taking on a very large-scale project, decided to cast a bunch of nobodies and some annoying B actors in the movies, make everything digitized and unconvinving, add unwanted and failed comic relief, add unwanted and failed sentimentality, and egotistically delete important parts of the trilogy to make room for scenes he pulled out of his bulbous posterior.With each successive movie in the trilogy things became sloppier and sillier and more redundant.  By the third movie, just about everything looked like it came out of a slick video game - it all culminates in a really poorly edited 'battle' in which some computerized armies are projected around a miniature city and lots of antics with digitized elephants, trolls, battering rams, orcs, elves, ghosts and John Rhys-Davies ensue, all of which are devoid of tension, excitement, or conviction.  As if Jackson hadn't punished my poor soul enough, he tacked on a syrupy half-hour epilogue with hobbits bouncing around on beds and Ian Holm in lame old man makeup.  I hang my head and weep.  Please, Mr. Jackson, can't we have some more cheap, gory zombie flicks?I'll be boycotting King Kong.  Sorry, Pete.	2.0	A classic destroyed	2004-12-29	25	6	19

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A16FUU8WW76QFY	gork57	What can one say about this film?  It is the climax to the greatest movie trilogy in the history of the genre-I think it is fair to say that the original Star Wars films have been eclipsed.  The 3 LOTR films have an adult storyline taken from one of the true classics of 20th - century literature, great acting (a travesty that only one actor, Ian McKellen, was nominated for an Oscar for 'Fellowship of the Ring'), and SFX by WETA that are second to none.The final installment of the series takes things to new heights in nearly every area.  The stupendous Battle of Pelennor Fields is simply awe inspiring; hordes of orcs, cave trolls, catapults, a squadron of oliphaunts, flying dragons, and a gigantic calvary charge...incredible!  One scene that really sticks with me is the death of Theoden, followed by Eowen's confrontation with the Witch King; it takes two good hacks of her sword to behead the Witch King's dragon, then she kills the Wraith with a blow to the face (aided by Pippin's timely stab in the leg).  Yes, this is only a PART of the grand scheme of things in this magnificent film.Taken in total, it is obvious that the Motion Picture Academy saw fit to reward Peter Jackson and cohorts for ALL THREE films in giving 11 Oscars to this movie.  Some have disagreed with this approach; I feel it is richly deserved.  When one watches the films on DVD, it seems that they should all be seen continously...they really are one long film.  The only real limiting factor is time.The one stellar thing about LOTR is through all the technical wizardry, the films never lose their basic humanity.  It is really the story of love and friendship, evil and greed, the lust for power and the love of freedom that make these three films the great accomplishments they truly are.  Now we wait and see if Jackson can pull off another miracle: remaking a true all time classic, animator Willis O'Brien's 'King Kong'.  Let's hope he does better than that DeLaurentiis debacle...	5.0	Stupendous End to a Modern Classic!	2004-04-14	7	5	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2L63RWENYXWSK	G. Pfeiffenschneider	So much has been said and written about Jackson's LOTR that I want to keep my contribution brief and clear.1) All in all I have greatly enjoyed the three films, and, while  I'm aware that, as with any work of art, LOTR cannot conform 100% to the individual viewer's taste, I found only minor causes for criticism-- except one: The killing of the Mouth of Sauron by Aragorn. In my opinion this one brief moment badly harms, almost ruins the credibility of the whole trilogy. With one swift stroke, the king-to-be here loses his dignity, moral integrity, and sense of justice, the most important attributes of a ruler. If only for a moment, he gollum-like displays his cowardly and inhumane lower self and (in my opinion) forfeits his right to wear the crown of Gondor. There was no need for this scene-- it is contrary to the spirit of all the rest of the movies (and the books). On first watching the extended version it shocked me so much that I had difficulty savouring the ending. Okay, it's only a movie, but ... what a pity. :-(2) My second remark concerns the bonus material, which (like with the other two dvds) conveys the exceptional commitment and cooperation of both cast and crew and the wonderful spirit Peter Jackson was able to generate and maintain among the team for so long. On watching and listening to all the enthusiastic interviews and moving footage witnessing people's dedication and friendship, I can't help hoping that this same collective, positive energy will also inspire other groups working on more serious issues such as famine, AIDS, climate change, or deforestation. The LOTR project is the living example of what true commitment can achieve; that lesson in itself is extremely precioussss! :-)	4.0	One dissonant note in an impressive and inspiring symphony	2004-12-25	8	4	4
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3XNGMK5LHY9P	G. P. Microulis	"The movie series directed by Peter Jackson adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's story ""The Lord Of The Rings"" is indeed an excellent one.To address some points of earlier reviewers, essential information and details of the book were left out of the films because they were essential to the book, not the film.  Remember that this is a Hollywood adaptation.  New Line Cinema still had to make money on this film and to produce it meant cutting a great deal of material from the original story.  I forgive Peter Jackson in that regard.While Elijah wood had not read the complete story of the LOTR before performing in it on camera, he did have excellent coaching on how to perform the role of Frodo.  With the likes of Rhys-Davies, McKellen and Holm there to help him, Mr. Wood did quite an excellent job.One must understand about what Tolkien wrote.  He was a man fascinated by languages, histories, mythologies and folklore and that is what he wrote about.  The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings, were just small stories or tales that took place in a fictional place for which he created an entire history and legend.  The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings are indeed just the tip of the iceberg.  Without these small stories, Tolkien's history would be limited to his childrens' bookshelves.  These stories helped bring to life a world of infinite wonder and creativity.  Likewise, without adapting the movies to fit the parameters of an epic motion picture, it would not sell, and it would not accomplish anything.I did not read any of Tolkien's work before I saw the first two installments of the LOTR.  It speaks volumes about the exceptional job of Peter Jackson and his crew that I saw his films and proceeded to not just read this story in its original form, but swim deep into the ocean that is Tolkien's work.  No matter how many times I read the LOTR, I will always envision in my mind Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Elrond and all the other characters as they were portrayed on screen by this excellent group of talented actors.I own the Extended Editions of the first two films and recommend them highly.  The added scenes do not drag the movie down or add meaningless menousia like some other movies do when extended versions are relesed.  Also, the commentaries are very nice to listen to.  You can learn a lot about the movies and filmaking by listening to them.  I especially like the design team commentary, their input is very helpful for a Tolkien fan.  While I highly recommend the movies, particularly in this special extended edition, I recommend the books, one hundred times moreover."	5.0	Adaptation Of Classic A Success	2004-11-02	3	0	3

Peter Jackson's skill here is never short of astonishing.  Every frame of this movie feels not only like a work of cinematic art, it serves to move the story forward at a pace respective of the material yet urging, coaxing it forward so that its more than four hour length never once feels weighty or bloated.Jackson seems well at home with his cast and the performances from every character - major and minor - ring with a dramatic truth so that they seemingly leap directly from Tolkien's pages.  With its potent mixes of adventure, fantasy, friendship and fear no emotion is spared or goes unchecked:  there are moments of pulse pounding terror, great comic relief, heartwarming as well as moments guaranteed to produce tears.  Return of the King brilliantly brings Tolkien's trilogy full circle and I cannot imagine a more satisfying evening of movie magic.	5.0	One of the Best Movies of All Time	2004-12-28	8	7	1

My previous extended edition of ""LotR: Return of the King"" had been a box set with four DVD's (at least before my apartment building burned down). This DVD was a bit thicker than the standard DVD case and only had 2 discs.I then saw that the movie was on a two-side disc and I was even more skeptical. I was only used to seeing ""classics"" on two-sided DVD's --  you know, the ""classic"" science fiction, horror and action movies you find in the dollar store for $2 each or 3-for-$5.But, I watched the movie and it was in excellent condition (which was good since it was still in the cellophane wrapping). I did have to flip the DVD over, but that was no big deal because, with the previous boxed set, I had to switch discs anyway.The DVD arrived in a very timely manner (at about the middle of the 14-day delivery window, not at the proverbial 14th day).

Stever	"I confess...of the three Lord of the Rings films, The Two Towers is my hands-down favorite. But Return of the King is a worthy second place in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. This is the extended edition. While it's fun to see the extra stuff, the theatrical release of this film is better paced and more watchable. I find that some places of this EE get bogged down with too much detail, particularly when it comes to the endless scenes with Gollum, easily my least favorite character in the triology. And we really didn't need more of Denathor...the stuff we already had was too ""over the top"" for my tastes.While I appreciated the extra scenes in the Paths of the Dead, I liked the theatrical release better from the standpoint that we don't learn that the dead have joined the battle until the critical moment. Revealing it too soon as is done in the EE ruins that later moment when the armies of the dead coming crashing down on Pelannor Fields.Easily the most enjoyable moment in ROTK-EE is the Gimle and Legolas drinking scene with a bemused Eomer looking on. Fun stuff!Disappointments? Well I guess I read too many spoilers because I was truly sad that the wedding of Faramir and Eowyn was not included after I had read that it had been filmed. I also wanted some new stuff at the end of the film...why not show Legolas and Gimle starting out on their adventures? It wouldn't have taken a lot of screen time and we know from the ""making of"" features that it was filmed.Overall this is a product that every true LOTR fan must own.

The flow of all three installments (culminating in this one) is seamless perfection, with cinematography, acting, and every other department absolutely shining. It's hard to imagine a better treatment of a better story. The DVD extras are another phenomenon altogether, to the extent that you can watch them all, you can play every commentary, and seeing the movie is still every bit as captivating as if you knew nothing about how it was made. Most qualities of good films are necessarily subjective, but this is as close to perfection as I've seen. Highly recommended for anyone, regardless of prior familiarity with the Rings trilogy.	5.0	Such perfection	2005-01-05	3	3	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2GRC6IJRA7W4H	HeadbangerDuh	This is one of the most beautiful, visually stunning action epics of all time. Viggo Mortensen leads a cast of highly talented and unusual actors and actresses that include Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, and Elijah Wood. The movie begins with the story of Smeagol's finding of the One Ring, and his descent into darkness and despair, turning into the hideous Gollum.We are then transported to the time the main story takes place, and we see Gollum leading Frodo and Sam on their treacherous journey in Mordor to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, and the unforgettable Gimli are searching for the lost Merry and Pippin, who are recovering from a victory over the evil Saruman. This is avery beautiful movie, with awe-inspiring scenes involving Galdalf riding over the meadows of Middle-earth with his staff shining across the skies like a beacon of light. Viggo Mortensen does a beautiful job of the star Aragorn is trying to find his destiny, which we all know lies as King of Gondor.The battle scenes are amazing. Peter Jackson did an amazing job of pulling it all together for this awe-inspiring three-and-a-half-hour movie. It is truly deserving of all 11 of its Academy Awards.NOTE TO PARENTS: This is a very, very violent movie. Much of the movie is intense battle sequences featuring thousands of warriors marching at each other, and although it is not espescially graphic,(except for one scene with the Nazgul) you might want to think twice about this movie for kids under 12.	5.0	An epic that will leave you slackjawed	2005-01-09	4	4	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AWL7FZN80O05Q	heather sterman	long before Return Of The King was released in theaters in December 2003, i tried endlessly to imagine what it would look like onscreen. and my interpretations were nothing compared to the final outcome. this is by far the most emotional film i have ever seen, more so than the previous LOTR films combined, which i admit shedding a few tears at. but watching ROTK, i cried full on buckets. while most people marvel at the grand scale of Minas Tirth or the mass destruction at Pelennor Fields, i feel most in touch with the power of human, er...hobbit emotion. Sam's undying devotion for his master Frodo is more powerful to me than the Ring itself. even after Frodo sends him packing, Sam's not about to abandon his best friend. no way will he allow Frodo to become dinner for the ravenous Shelob. and he's sure as hell not going to permit the Orcs to have their way with him. and he's definitely not going to stand for Frodo claiming the Ring at the foot of the Crack Of Doom. it's truly a shame that Sean Astin wasn't nominated for an Oscar. he truly deserved it, as did many of the actors/actresses in the film. in fact, i'm fairly certain i cried for the last 90 minutes of the film (and that also includes the closing credits featuring Annie Lennox's haunting voice).generally in films, it's the larger and more noticeable scenes that stand out in the audience's mind. for me, it was the simple opening sequence- where the young Smeagol is introduced in the flesh, unaware that he is about to embark on the ultimate trip to Hell with no return ticket. to me, witnessing his most unfortunate downward spiral is the most shocking and remarkable film clip i've ever seen. for years, i despised Gollum for my own personal reasons. but seeing him come to life onscreen made me feel sympathy for him, especially when it came to presenting him in his previous incarnation, which clearly demonstrates that no one is perfect. but one thing is for certain- the last chapter of the LOTR films is more perfect than i could have ever imagined.	5.0	embracing the little things in life	2004-09-10	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3960MOX93NBW0	Helder Gil	There is a little over a month left until the ROTK extended DVD release. I cannot wait.For the Tolkien purists out there who seem to get a thrill out of carping about how Peter Jackson didn't do this, that or the other thing, take a deep breath and relax. Jackson filmed the movies so that they would appeal to a wide audience and not just to Tolkien enthusiasts. The movies turned on a whole new generation to Tolkien's works. I had never read LOTR until after seeing Fellowship in the theaters. After seeing the film, I bought the books and tore through them in a few weeks. I doubt I am the only one who had this experience.Yes there is stuff I wish Jackson had included in the films. But that doesn't mean his adaptation of the books is an insult to Tolkien's writing abilities or storytelling genius.If the Tolkien purists hate Jackson's version so much, then why not take up a collection and make your own LOTR films?As for me, I will gladly fork over money to see this extended version of the film. And I will say a little prayer every night before going to bed that Jackson brings The Hobbit to the big screen and then does a film on all that happens in the Appendicies of ROTK.	5.0	Giddy like a schoolgirl	2004-11-03	34	23	11
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AUITKX16DITVO	Helel	If a heroic adventure is to be credible then the main thing it needs is a great villian. Sadly the dreadful and almost non-existent villian Sauron ruins any sense of greatness that the film might have had. A pathetic eye on a stick is hardly impressive and the whole notion of the ring being such a threat is laughable. The Lord of the Rings can't compare to modern fantasy, and that's a shame.There is also alot of hammy dialogue, with some un-called for sad music that play almost on queue like a soap opera. You can't fault the beautiful CGI or the impressive sets, but it's all so much gloss that fails to cover the hollow heart of the final film.Also Gandalf is probably the worst magician in cinema history, even harry potter seems to know more spells than he does. It's almost cringe worthy to watch him posture and grandstand then let off a little puff of magic.The ending is dreadfully slow and boring and shows Jackson doesn't know when to quit.Strangely enough the game Lord of the Rings - The third age for xbox and ps2 is really alot more impressive than these films, and is a better representation of the trilogy.	2.0	A very polished movie based on a poor Book	2005-10-10	29	1	28

It is quite possibly my favorite movie ever. Its great characters, story, special effects, and very good devotion to J.R.R. Tolkien's book make it very well worthy of your 4 hours' time.The theatrical version, which I only saw once (in the theater), was perfect and well worthy of its 11 Academy Awards. The extended edition improves on perfection with its flawless new and extended scenes, making the movie much more entertaining and understandable.The new scenes not only tie up loose ends, but they also spice up the story and make it more entertaining and exciting. The Voice of Saruman is one of the best new scenes, and I really don't know why it wasn't in the theatrical version. In the Company of Orcs is one of my favorites as well, showing much more of Frodo and Sam's difficulties in getting to the Cracks of Doom. The Mouth of Sauron was a very nice addition also. Eowyn's Dream is probably the least necessary of all the new scenes, as it doesn't convey anything of great importance to the audience, but it's not out of place or anything. The new scenes, for the most part, are pure pefection.The extended scenes give you more story, more special effects, and (this is my personal favorite) more fighting. All the extended scenes are excellent.The only thing that I am sad about that has to do with this film is that we've reached the journey's end to The Lord of the Rings. This movie is the crown jewel of the trilogy, the epic finish to Peter Jackson's near-perfect interpretation of J.R.R. Tolkien's perfect books.

There is only so much you can put into a film and their is so much in the LOTR books that it is amazing for me to see that one director can tell the story so clearly.

The fact is, even though our kids would love this move if it were FIVE hours long, three+ hours is too long for a parent to sit through a children's movie.  I don't mind spending time with my kids, in fact we've spent longher than this playing leggos many times.  But watching aliens and wizards and pixies mincing around flogging eachother with rubber swords is a totally passive, non-interactive activity, and it's unreasonable to expect parents to be willing to do it for more than an hour and a half, two hours tops.But I am giving it three stars because I sort of enjoyed it.  Part of me likes the whole dungeons and dtragons motif, probably the same part that still likes to play leggos!  I don't need every movie I see to be Schindler's List.  I'll go see a Finding Nemo, a Toy Story, or even a Lord of the Rings as a treat to my kids.

Like the books from which they are adapted, they are worth seeing again and again.  Peter Jackson finishes with the same respect for the original that was evident in the beginning.  In spite of changes required for film continuity (and most importantly, changes made for certain movie audience expectations) nearly every fan of Tolkien will appreciate the director's efforts.In the story of the One Ring and the campaign to destroy it, there are strong emotions:  friendship, devotion, duty, love.  Tolkien evoked these feelings in the reader in words, painting scenes and creating characters on the printed page.  These scenes and characters live as powerfully on the screen, brought to life by a cast and a land equal to the task.In the extended DVD version, several questions are answered and some events are fuller because of the fifty minutes of additional material not included in the theater version.  One of these is a short scene with Eowyn and Faramir that should never have been left out.In the commentary section, cast members discuss some of these and how they felt about their exclusion.  The documentaries, interviews, and other special material add to the experience, but are extensive enough for a separate night of viewing.	5.0	Three in a row	2005-01-05	2	2	0

The only problem is plane tickets are expensive, around 2000.00 dollars where i live.I am looking forward to the extended edition, especially for the scene when the ""mouth of Sauron""  Saurons lieutenant comes out to meet them and throws down frodo's mithrel vest, making the heros think that frodo failed.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2B0XO8BTPRX7R	Ian Vance	I attended the theatrical release of *Return of the King* on December 17th, 2003, queuing in line for two hours and waiting another hour once seated in the auditorium. The energy of the room seethed with barely retrained anticipation, a tangible excitement, along with perhaps a trace of nervousness - Jackson was 2 for 3, but *King* was the watershed: the one film where all of LotR's themes, character arcs, plot development and essential tension would find climatic resolution...or else fail, either spectacularly or disastrously, rendering all that before a wasted effort.  I personally had no doubts as to Jackson and co.'s abilities, and the film more than exceeded my expectations, capping the cinematic momentum of its two predecessors and paying satisfactory adaptation to the book(s) upon which it was based.  And yet, a feeling of incompletion haunted my euphoria, a sentiment very much similar to my reaction to the theatrical version of *The Two Towers*.  The special effects blew me away, the acting more than once tugged a tear from my eyes, yet in the end I knew what I had witnessed was a truncated version of *Return of the King*, with a rumored hour of footage left on the editing floor.  The cuts were dramatic - Saruman, the Witch-King/Gandalf confrontation - and, in some places, disconcertingly obvious, the rough transitions and haphazard pacing occasionally jerking me from the spell of the film.  I consoled myself that an Extended Edition would eventually `complete' the movie I had just witnessed, filling in the blank spaces and producing a much ~smoother~ viewing experience.  Such had been the case with *The Two Towers*, another film that suffered in its condensed version and subsequently became a masterpiece upon the Extended release.It is my firm belief that Peter Jackson as his illustrious associates (all several thousand of them) filmed these movies to *be* a 12 hour cinematic cycle, and the demands of the in-theater attention span (and New Line's profit margin) forced into necessity the widespread and sometimes arbitrary editing process.  The films themselves, when compared side by side, are testament enough; and the voluminous evidence as to the trials and tribulations of paring this four hour epic down to size, by way of the documentaries featured on this edition, set this impression in stone.  Like many others, I have no desire whatsoever to re-visit the theatrical releases, the Extended being the true completed rendition of *LotR*.The additional material of *Return of the King* tends to focus on small, intimate character moments, increasing the weight and depth of the story as a whole; and in the subtle lengthening of individual scenes, turning chopped cliff-notes *LotR* into a fully realized creative scope.  And what scope this is! It's easy to see why *Return of the King* amassed the box office returns and awards that it did - the film elevates all that brought forth previously, and enhances it tenfold.  The battles are bigger and incredibly intense, with much more at stake; the emotional denouement of Frodo and Sam's journey, from the pastoral Shire to the hellish pits of Mt. Doom, is devastating.  It helps that every aspect of the filmmaking process was taken up a notch post-production. Return of the King has the best special effects of the three movies (the best I've ~ever~ seen, to be honest), the grandest and most resonant score courtesy of Howard Shore, and an overall confidence/mastery of cinematography and scale that, on a purely aesthetic level, make *Return of the King* an artistic wet-dream, breathtakingly beautiful to an astonishing degree.  And now with the original editing restored and the drama allowed its maximum impact, this film has become cinematic near-perfection, the crown jewel of Jackson's masterpiece.That said, *Return of the King* does have its share of minor flaws that even the Extended cut was unable to overcome.  The opening flashback fishing scene with Smeagol and Deagol struck me as overtly goofy, especially in lue of its homicidal conclusion.  The Armies of the Dead, when viewed afar, look rather fake, the only real CGI mishap.  Denathor's character remains sadly underdeveloped, his madness via palantir-corruption strangely excised.  And the much-hyped Witch-King/Gandalf fight comes in far too abruptly and, though I'm no purist, violates the original text.  But these are minor when compared to the Lighting of the Beacons...Minas Tirith, in all its [miniature] glory...the Houses of Healing...the Ride of the Rohirrim...the entire Oliphaunt confrontation...the cataclysmic choice at Mt. Doom. At last, at long last, a fantasy world has come to life on the silver screen: a mythos has been made real.The effort involved to make it feel as real as possible is chronicled and concluded on the two Appendices discs; and, more than before, the toll it took to produce these movies, and the exactitude of craft Weta achieved, is presented with painstaking detail.  Although early reports about *RotK* were positive - Jackson constantly stating that it was the easiest and most fun to make - the Appendices reveal that this was an affirmation-faade: *RotK* more than doubled the number of effects shots of the first two movies combined, and proved a nightmare for Jackson and Jamie Selkirk to (not quite) successfully edit into a cohesive whole.  Particularly revealing is a section where one of the peak effects shots, that of the Oliphants colliding, was rejected due to cinematography issues: the staff went back and composed the shots in a 48 hour stretch, on the very threshold of the deadline.  Amazing stuff! It's rewarding to see these artisans go up and beyond anything they thought they were capable of, and in turn fashion some of the best work in cinematic history.Filming *The Lord of the Rings* was once considered impossible by conventional standards; but with the right amount of passion, dedication and love for the source material, a little team from New Zealand surmounted all odds and produced a stunning success.

It is on the top of the charts in almost every category except for most nominated, and it's not too far from the top. This movie is much more deserving of eleven oscars and one billion dollars plus at the box office than the piece of trash sleeper that's supposed to potray the Titanic disaster. The Return of the King leads in all of the categories that potray a movie: action (and I mean action!), tradgedy, drama, love, visual effects, directing and producing, and story. The action, as I'm sure you've realized, is my favorite part. The movie has plenty of sequences. Legolas's bow and arrow rocks, as does Gimli's axe and Aragorn's sword. Gandalf, Merry, and Pippin also get to participate this time as well. There's also plenty of humor in the action. Let's not forget Gimli's comment on Legolas's big kill (""It still only counts as one!"") and the confrontation between Theoden's niece and the Nazghul king (""You fool, don't you realize that no man can defeat me?""""Well, then, it's a good thing I'm a woman!""). The love in this movie is fantastic. Aragorn and Arwen are constantly thinking about each other like true lovers (and no adultery and betrayal like other movies (Titanic...Cough, cough))and the love (like the kind between true friends) that the hobbits show to each other is moving and powerful.

Great special effects and edge of the seat action, with plot twists, interesting monsters, captivating characters, and some life lessons to boot.The final episode of this trilogy earned a best picture award, an achievement the first two parts were nominated for but did not win.  The question is whether this was the most worthy, or if it won the award because the other two parts didn't, but either way, the award was deserved.This picture comes across as one project broken up into three viewable segments, if you consider a 3 (or more) hour movie viewable.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was all filmed at once.  Thus, the flow between the movies are pretty seamless, and not seeming to be separate parts put together as most movie series are.Vigo Mortenson does an excellent job as does Ian McKellan and John Rhys-Davies, and I enjoyed Kate Blanchett (I believe) as the elf queen and Orlando Bloom.  Personally, though, none compares Sean Astin's portrayal of Frodo's loyal companion, Sam.  There are characters who make you think of other people (though no one thinks they are that character), and there are characters who one can identify with.  The rare blessing is, like Sam, for the character to be one that you not only relate to, but motivates you to be the best you can be.  Sam is that kind of character.  I love the line where he said to Froddo, ""I cannot carry it (the ring), but I can carry you.""

This was a great movie about the triumph of good over evil, good people over evil tyrants, etc. Now I want to see the first two again. I see now the full sweep of this work. It isn't really three movies; it is one long movie and the division into three parts was more of a publishing decision than an artistic one. SEE THIS MOVIE!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A192KEPM0HW6AC	"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e..."	"I did not seek out this movie, because I never could get into D&D;costume flicks. I suppose that the closest I came to being a potential reveller in these movies is that I am a fan of Ronnie James Dio's album ""Slaying the Dragon,"" but that really is quite a stretch.First of all, the cinematography is gorgeous: Lots of light streaming in nooks and crannies and crevices. A lot of muted tones of pewter, forest green and cobalt blue -- it made me wonder why Peter Jackson didn't have it filmed in black and white; would have made more sense, but most people have an irrational aversion to black and white, particularly those who are epic movie fans.The costumes and sets were very good and very believeable, as were the special effects. Lots of Indiana Jones stuff, but without Indiana Jones.Mostly, though, my chief complaint is with the script and the acting. I'm sure glad that there was one reviewer here to tell me that this was about good and evil. I sort of got that from Elijah Wood running aroud everywhere toting this gold ring which has supernatural, but very unlucky powers. He really wants to get rid of it bad, sort of like a Medieval ""Talking Tina"" doll.There's only one way to totally get rid of it, though, and that's why what otherwise would have been a half-hour ""Twilight Zone"" episode has been turned into a mini-series Renaissance faire that's longer than Wagner's (coincidentally) Ring cycle.Actually, this plot would have been better as a Star Trek episode. After an hour of the ring causing Tribbles in the cargo hold and invading Klingons, Jim Kirk could have soliloquy'd:""Got....to....get....rid...of...ring,"" whereupon Spock would have replied, ""Captain, the logical course of action is to send it back to the jeweler, and get a refund. It's still under warranty.""However, this collection of celluloid deals with nerds before theadvent of daily bathing, though I often wonder, ""did this  fellowship of crusaders get their perfect 21st century teeth because the ring comes with a comprehensive dental plan?""The main weakness of this movie is the acting. Sure, Sir Lord Knight Ian MacKellen gives a believeable performance as the Old Guy in the Witch's Hat. The rest of the movie, however, consists of a bunch of pretty fair haired lads and lasses who impart inscrutable piffle to each other in the form of deeply profound sounding monologues, delivered in a deeply anesthetizing monotone.  Everything is so gosh darned deep and weighty, but when these folks lock their glassy Jim Jones Unification Churcheyes, we in the audience are sure to know: ""Ah ha! Here comes another clue! Now we can get out our Little Orphan Bilbo decoder rings to try and figure out just what in Hades they're talking about!""Now, this may be my fault. When I was in high school, I scoffed at the D&D; playing, ""Chronicles of Narnia"" reading, Hobbit horse nerds. I was a more socially well-adjusted nerd, belonging to the far more sensible backgammon club and into new wave music like Devo and Duran Duran. So, I can't exactly relate to all this knights of the ringtable esoterica. So, if you're inclined to be one who's into this sort of thing, I'm sure it will have you on the edge of your seat, comparing the movie to the book.But, for the unconverted, I really wish that the actors had been primed for these pictures by being forced to watch movies by Errol Flynn, Charlton Heston, Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, to see how to breathe some life into their anemic performances. My God, it was as though the whole cast somnambulated their way through the script on Prozac. Heston wouldn't have done it that way. Oh, no: He would have had a ""damn it all to hell, you damn dirty apes are all made out of soylent green!"" moment or two.Orson Welles would have waddled through the enchanted forest, drawling in Southern dialect some about how the corrupt ring could be bribed, and the dashing Olivier and Flynn would have swashbuckled away the dragons and flying monkeys from Wizard of Oz without even getting a run in their tights.But, that would have been seen in this sophisticated era as lessprofound and more entertaining. Entertaining don't get Oscars nowadays.When -- after what had seemed almost an eternity -- I told my cousin ""I can't believe I sat through the WHOLE trilogy!"" -- he thereupon informed me I had only seen just ONE of the films. I passed on seeing the other two, fearing the strain on my faculties, and not having enough toothpicks to hold up my eyelids to keep me awake.Instead, I did something far more exciting and less time-consuming: Counting every single blad of grass in my front yard with a magnifying glass and an abacus."	3.0	Not My Goblet of Tea	2005-01-05	34	5	29

I'll explain from a readers point of view(or hardcore LOTR fans) the movie lacks in detail and some things are left unexplained(or left out like Tom Bombadil >&lt;!!! and the vally of the Withywindle!) but if your a first time viewer like some(or a very young age) you really don't have much to lose and you won't be dissapointed with lots of  action and a very indepth story that will leave you on the edge of your seat! Though I have heard that the ending has been altered >&lt;!!. The part of the book that explains the after math of what happens I heard was going to be takin out because of time issues >&lt;!. I won't give away to much i'm sure I'v said enough to atleast get you woundering what happends(or if u read the books woundering if they are gonna screw us over of a great ending and other great parts that will be left out! >&lt;!!). So I hope this helps you some what . No matter what happens go see this movie and then read the books. I think you will understand where the readers are coming from(Harry Potter fans should know what i'm screaming about. Looking at the reviews of the up coming movies and how some where very displeased with left out parts of the old movies though i'v never read any of the books but I plan on it). If you get the chance play ROTK on ps2 IT ROCKS! by looking at the movie clips from the game I can't wait to see the battle of Pelennor Fields and Shelob who haunted Cirith Ungol(The last offspring of  Ungoliant from the First Age. Morgoth and Ungoliant destory the Two Trees of Valinor. Also if you have read the Hobbit  they infest  Mirkwood though they are of lesser decent and not as powerful as Shelob and nothing compared to Ungoliant) heh maybe this will get you to read the Simarillion! I think they should make a movie about Simarillion though the text if weird at the start and hard to fallow and not so much like LOTR. The storys are ALOT more tragic then LOTR  could ever hope to be in any form(least in my option) I mean u don't see frodo being tricked by a dragon to fall in love with his sister then have her baby an snaping out of the spell and then jump off a cliff into a watery grave! Thats what I call tragic!(though it was the sister under the spell and then she comes out of the spell once the dragon dies to find out she is having her brothers baby and jumps off the cliff her baby and all :( its a sad story but I you should read it :D ) so anyway this is my review and i'm going to shut up now before I keep blabing away and use up all 1000 words of this review heh heh heh heh.	5.0	Good or bad for u to decide	2003-11-30	14	2	12

My only problem was not with the movie, but with the audience. I feel the need to take a stand, here and now. People, please do not applaud in the movie theater! This happened at least 20 times (no lie) during the movie, and I ended up missing parts. I never understood the whole applauding thing anyway.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1P9NQ0XUE44S9	Jacob Victory	"Like abstract art, The Return of the King, I found, was the most pyschological of the triology.  Very intellectual yet subtle and moving, too. It focused more on ""what if"" scenarios, cleverly portrayed by a remarkably seasoned cast.  By ""what if"" I mean you imagine what could happen.  What could happen if Gollum succeeded in his plan? If Rohan fell? If the elves left, forever?  If Frodo failed?  If the steward of Gondor got the ring?The movie, while lengthy, also had a certain aspect of quiet about it.  The fairtale-ness of the Twin Towers and the missionary aspect of the Fellowship of the Ring shift to a more thoughtful sense of duty, of honor, of setting things back to the right path.  I found a lot of dignity in Frodo and Sam's quest to climb Mt. Doom.  Gollum's tortured existence is more clearly defined; pity is more easily attributed to him as he plots to break Frodo's and Sam's relationship and prey on Frodo's vulnerabilities.  Gondor's steward is beautifully portrayed as the utterly unfair, ambitious and elegant madman.While the ending was predictable (even for those who have not read the book) there is quiet power to this movie.  The fellowship still exists.  The mission is accomplished.  Love reunites; peace is reassembled; calm and order reign freely.I highly recommend this movie.  The cast is noble.  The dialogue more serious.  The consequences of failure more concrete.  Like poetry, the movie makes you think and pleasantly lingers in your thoughts as it teaches.  Kudos on a job well done."	4.0	A Quiet Power and a fine ending	2004-05-17	9	7	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	It is not the best episode though it is the crowning piece. Not the best because there are by far too many and too long battles which are quite repetitive in effects. But it is an essential episode to understand or extract some meaning in this fantasy. The vanity of the human king is turning criminal since he tries to burn his surviving son, who he does not like, alive. The hobbit Frodo who has been entrusted with the mission of carrying the ring back into the pit of hell is also shown as being vain somewhere in his mission. Vain because he believes he has been entrusted with this mission because he is special, though in fact it is the mission that is going to make him in the future somewhat special. Vain too because he does not understand he cannot succeed alone. And there the help of Sam is dramatically shown as essential to fulfill his mission,  not to betray it, not to let some kind of disgusting being and a giant spider of the deep caves of earth distract him and rob him of the ring, which it actually does, and not to fall into the pit himself along with the underground traitor and the ring. But the lesson is more for us than for the hobbit himself since he does not seem to learn his simple lesson very easily. The main lesson is that a batttle can only be won when everyone, including the dead come up and fight. This inclusion of the dead into the fight makes it slightly spectacular and is an allusion to Jesus and other Saviors who had to go down into the limboes or hell to do some salvaging with Adam and Eve or Euridyce. But the meaning - of the film - comes from some strong imagery used with a fair level of insistance. The world is cut in two. The dark forces of evil on one side to whom the ring has to be returned in order to be destroyed, and all the others representing light. Contrast between light and darkness, between underground traps, caves and tunnels and open air and countryside, between blue sky and very dark grey if not black sky, between the more or less civilized use of fire on the good side and its evil use on the bad side. The final battle is in front of the black gate that looks like a wall that finally crumbles and sinks into the ground at the end like some other wall fell in 1989. That can only be a modern vision since when the books were written the wall in question did not even stand. Since then this image has been turned around since two walls are being built but no longer by the forces of the east or the north, but by the forces of the west, one in Palestine and the other along Mexico's northern border (in that case the north is not supposed to be the bad side, and yet). History is twisty at times. The books were written during the Cold War and they represent this vision of the time of a world cut in two, black and white, etc. This today has changed too and this simple splitting of reality in two does not correspond to reality though it is still very active in the minds of people who still think a lot on an either/or line. So today, what used to be the reflection of cold war fear becomes rather simplistic and we experience everyday how this approach of the world and life leads to catastrophes and other swampy situations. The end of this third episode with the return of peace and quiet turns slightly emotional not to say sentimental or even sentimentalese. Too much crying indeed and too much sadness compensated by the joy of peace, love and a couple of weddings. Altogether it brings the tale to an end but it does not reach the height of the second episode, though we can see some of the inspiration of another recent series in the field of fantasy, Harry Potter who links the modern world with this underground fantasy world like Stephen King in the Dark TowerDr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne	4.0	Too many battles and too sentimental	2007-01-11	8	0	8

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1V7O3TXW2FQD5	Jade Sable	"THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE IN THE LOTR TRILOGY!  IT IS THE BEST FOUR HOURS YOU WILL SPEND WATCHING THIS!  FROM START TO FINISH IT IS NON STOP ACTION AND THRILLS!We cheer the defeat of Saruman and the flooding of Isnegard and reunite with Merry and Pippin. Gandalf and Pippin find Saruman's palantir, which reassures them that he has no more power left.  Rohan prepares for a call from Gondor while Pippin puts everybody in danger by looking in to the palantir and foreseeing the fall of Minas Tirith and making Sauron believe that he has the ring, so Gandalf takes Pippin and heads for the White City, Minas Tirith, which is as beautiful as Boromir describes to Aragorn.Frodo and Sam's journey becomes more creepier as Gollum plots their demise so he can get the ring.  He takes them past the dreadful abode of the Witch-King of Ang Mar, the leader of the Nazgul and the one who stabbed Frodo.  We learned from Gandalf that the Witch King can't be killed by man (Uh Oh)Gandalf and Pippin make it to Minas Tirith to learn from Faramir's army that the orcs ambushed them and took over Osgiliath, thei last wall of defense.  Not good, especially since a lot of his men are killed during the retreat by the Nazgul.  (Yes, you'll end up really hoping those nasty buggers meet their fate!)  We get to know Faramir way better and feel bad for him, since his father, Denethor, the steward of Gondor, lets him know he favored Boromir over him and wished he had died instead of Boromir. The rotten SOB tells Faramir to reclaim Osgiliath and hints he might look upon him more favorably, depending on his return.  It tugs the heart strings watching the soldiers marching to Osgiliath as white flowers are thrown to them and Gandalf tries to talk sense into Faramir (""Your father loves you, he will realize it before the end."") but he insists on trying to recapture Osgiliath.Gandalf sends Pippin to light the beacons of Gondor, which is a spectacular chain reaction.  Rohan rides to their aid and sends Gamling and Eomer to find recruits from their neighboring towns.They end up getting less than half of what they expected but Elrond, under the insistence of the dying Arwen, re-forges Narsil and presents it to Aragorn.  He reminds him of the dead army hiding in the mountain and we learn that the dead army had turned chickens**t and fled during the war and were cursed by Isildur: never to rest until they fufilled their oaths to the next king who summoned them.  Elrond also informs Aragorn of a fleet of Corsair ships sailing from the south waiting to ambush Gondor.  (More Uh oh!)While Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas make their way to the Land of the Dead, Gollum drives a wedge between Frodo and Sam and he leads the unsuspecting Frodo to Shelob's lair.  Frodo is bitten and Sam sneaks the ring away before the Mordor Orcs take him away.  Aragorn proves to the King of the Dead that he is the King of Gondor and they set out to intercept the Corsairs.  Sam rescues Frodo, returns the ring to him and Faramir returns injured but Denethor thinks he's dead and feels guilty for how hw treated him and almost burns him alive but Gandalf and Pippin rescue Faramir and Denethor sees his eyes opening before he burns to death, which suited as a perfect punishment.  (Sorry, but I thought Denethor was an a**hole in case u can't tell)This all leads up to the breathtaking, epic battle scene in Pelennor.  The battle of Pelennor makes the battle at Helm's Deep look like a little catfight.  That's how amazing this is done!  The Rohirrim annihilate 3/4 of the orcs and get beseiged by a group of Oliphants (Messed up elephants.)  There's a chuckler when Aragorn and Gimli resume their count of enemies slain and Legolas eliminates an oliphant and it's riders all on his own and Gimli glares at him and shouts: 'That still only counts as one!"" Eowyn, disguised as a soldier and Merry brilliantly take out an oliphant and make one of the most memorable scenes in the movie:  Theoden is killed by the Witch King and before his monster he rides can feast on him, Eowyn steps up and challenges the Witch King, threatening to kill him if he touches her uncle. She decapitates the monster (Yay)  and looks doomed when she see what she is facing. She stands her gound until her shield is shattered and the Witch King grabs her by the throat, hissing: ""Fool, no man can kill me!""  Merry stabs the Witch King in the leg and Eowyn grabs her sword and rips off her helmet, proclaiming: 'I AM NO MAN!' and takes out the Witch King.  Simply amazing, all I have to say.  What a catch, huh?Aragorn shows up with the dead army and they kick the crap out of the rest of the oliphants and the orc army.  With that battle won, they realize there are about 50,000 mordor orcs standing between Frodo and Mt. Doom so Aragorn plans to distract Sauron's eye and empty his lands so Frodo has a chance to destroy the ring.  Frodo lets the corruption take over him and slips it on, prompting Gollum tot ackle him and bite his finger off,  Gollum slips off the cliff and falls into the fiery pit, destroying the ring and Sauron with it.The only bit of a disappointment is that we never saw Sauron in person.  I was expecting Sauron himself to appear during the battle at Barad Dur and maybe go one on one with Aragorn  or something, since Aragorn wielded Narsil, the same sword that cut the hand off of Sauron.  I'm not too terribly bummed though, because the battles, costumes, extras, background, music and acting were spectacular.  This movie earned all the awards it won and many of our actors will be remembered most for their performances in these movies.  If Fellowship of the Ring had you on the edge of your seat, this will grab you off and into the movie!  I just can't get enough of it.  And to the punks that dissed this movie:  Get a life!  You have no taste and we LOTR fans don't need to be reminded of that!This movie may be a little pricey but it is worth getting.  Peter Jackson did a mrvelous job with this and LOTR fans will appreciate this for many years to come.  IF I COULD GIVE THIS MOVIE 5 TRILLION STARS I WOULD!

J.K. Rowling, shut up and sit down, you're time in the limelight is over. J.R.R. Tolkien has returned in the spirit of this excellent movie- no, TRILOGY!! This is such an awesome trilogy itself, and each movie is just beyond words. Oh yeah, if you guys disagree with me and tell me to move out of my parents' basement like one man said on this website, nice try, 'cause i'm 13! and even if there are 40 year old fans, give them a break 'cause they have good taste, it's a fact! Even more than 50 years this book has been on shelves, and this trilogy is still hoppin' and poppin'! It's been famous for that long. (How do you like them apples, Harry?)So if you like harry potter and love those books and movies, keep away, 'cause like it has been for the past 50 years, this trilogy (Books and movies) is the real fantasy deal.So all you ""Harry Potter"" dorks and ""Dungeons and Dragons"" goofballs should be on your knees, bowing to this trilogy and Mr. J.R.R. Tolkien, 'cause the creators of all those cheap fantasy series you like admitted that they couldn't have done this without Mr. J.R.R. Tolkien's amazing and astonishing work. J.R.R. Tolkien is the God of Fantasy, and Peter Jackson (the director/producer/writer) is the most talented and most gifted directors today, so you cheap fantasy nerds, maybe you should think twice about what you're getting into and then get into this stuff, 'cause you'l know what I'm talking about. And if you're one of those people who never even saw or read this trilogy, shut your mouth, 'cause you have no room to speak in here 'cause you dont know what this trilogy's like, so watch or/and read this trilogy, and it would be wise to make a second opinon on what you thought before, 'cause it ain't nerdy stuff, that's for sure, and I know my fellow 'Ringers' know what I'm talkin about! So whoever you are, stop reading this review and buy the first 2 movies that are already out on DVD/VHS, and see the Return of the King right now. Go on [...] or whatever and see it.

Once again Peter Jackson has lovingly crafted a cinematic experience faithful to Tolkien's masterpiece, and everyone involved deserves high praise for bringing The Lord of the Rings to cinematic life.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A15Y2FQ5WNR63Y	"James D. DeWitt ""Alaska Fan"""	"Any review of ""Return of the King"" has to start from first principles: First, the books are too long to make into a movie, even a trilogy. Second, not everyone has read the books, or liked what they read. Sad but true. Third, of those who have read and liked the books, only a few of us have them mostly memorized. So any successful film production must take into account that parts of the books must be dropped, that the story has to be interesting and accessible to those who haven't read the trilogy, and that the movies must still honor the trilogy for those who have read - or memorized - Tolkien's life work. Those are the realities; we must judge the movie on those realities.You can quibble over some very minor details, but Peter Jackson's telling of Return of the King balances these principles masterfully. Compression? Yes, of course. When Aragorn and Legolas lost the horses at the entrance to the Paths of the Dead, how, I asked myself, were they going to cross the hundreds of leagues from Erech to the Anduin? Excision? Yes, of course. The confrontation of Gandalf and Saruman. The confrontation with the Mouth of Saruman. The Houses of Healing. Imrahil. But the book trilogy is just too long to fit into three manageable movies. The absolutely critical scenes are all there. The story line is not lost or compromised. I will never know if it appears choppy to those unfamiliar with the books, but for me the compressions and excisions did not seriously detract.Jackson also had to find a way to make the movie accessible to those who have never read the books. Those challenges included finding some way of demonstrating the pure evil of the One Ring. Those who have not read or do not remember the books don't know Tolkien's extended descriptions of what Frodo was experiencing. A movie maker's tools for making that introspection into exposition are pretty limited. The opening scene between Deagol and Smeagol brilliantly reminds viewers of the absolutely corrupting influence of the one Ring. Only by watching every character be tempted by the Ring, and watching many of those tempted succumb, can strangers to the Trilogy begin to know what Frodo was experiencing. The books are full of other, equally challenging problems for a scriptwriter and a director. Jackson handles them all quite well.But Jackson also brought his own talents and imagination to the story. Is there anyone who wasn't transfixed by Jackson's invented sequence of Faramir's doomed charge on Osgiliath while Pippin is made to sing for Denethor? It's the difference between merely filming the book and making a movie. Jackson's additions range from brilliant to interesting; none of them detract from the story.Finally, Jackson had to preserve the attention and respect of the sizeable minority of us who cherish the books. Speaking for myself, that moment came when Jackson had Aragorn turn to the crowd after his coronation, and recite, in Elvish, the words of Elendil when he came to Middle Earth. No subtitles; no explanation. Obviously, that line was for hard core fans alone. Having Aragron chant the lines was just icing on the cake.Brilliant special effects. Superb unity of plot, theme, and character across the three movies - compare Isildur's half smile when he declines to destroy the Ring at Elrond's urging with the look on Frodo's face at the penultimate moment. And the knife's edge balancing of these principles. This is an excellent adaptation, nearly flawless. Highly recommended."	5.0	Achieving the Impossible	2004-01-05	35	31	4

Unfortunately, this is not true.  The only thing more impressive was the battle at Minis Tirrith (as opposed to Helm's Deep).  Other than the enormous undertaking of this fantastic battle, there is nothing more fantastic about this movie.Which does not make this movie bad.  This movie is truly wonderful and a fantastic ending to this epic trilogy.  My only complaint is this... the last half an hour was very, very slow.  Of all the things they COULD cut out of the book, they could have reduced the amount of time it took to wrap up the story.  At the theater, movie goers were literally moaning, asking, ""What, another scene!!"", and even a few just stood up and left.But BRAVO to the special effects and a great story.

I mean seriously words cant describe how good this movie was so bare with me. First of all i have to say Peter Jackson really outdid himself with this 1 their were hardly any mistakes in ""Return"" other then the ending which i didnt understand but i wont spoil it for some of you who havent seen it yet.Basically it picks up from ""Two Towers"" where you find Frodo and Sam getting closer to Mt Doom to finally destroy the ring of power and rid middle earth of evil. Elijah and Sean do a great job in taking us with them on their journey. i felt like i was the 4th person there thats how perfect the acting was. But i strongly suggest if you havent seen the first 2 then dont watch this 1 because you wont have a clue on whats going on.so definately worth owing in any DVD library even if its not the extended version."	5.0	Good Job Mr Frodo	2004-05-25	0	0	0

Kinloch ""JamesinSeattle"""	The Lord of the Rings trilogies are, in my opinion, the most brilliant and visually stunning movies ever made. Peter Jackson was born to direct the J.R.R. Tolkien classic, and his vision of Middle Earth is captivating. Since I cannot review the first two movies, Fellowship and Towers, (Amazon has been inundated) I will just sum up my thoughts with this third and final installment, The Return of the King. This movie, just like it's two predecessors, is AMAZING. Superbly acted (I'm taken away by Viggo), powerfully directed and filmed, and completely seamless in visual and special effects. ROTK is the knockout conclusion we have all been waiting for. Prior to going, my partner and I watched the first two on DVD, then went to the theater. We left feeling such a sense of gratification and astonishment. The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and now, The Return of the King are cinematic masterpieces that have inspired me and moved me. I look forward to the release of ROTK on DVD, and will cherish all three films for the rest of my days.	5.0	A Masterpiece!	2004-01-12	5	4	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A82ERAETX0INV	James O'Hare	OK, call me a book nerd, but I wasn't as impressed as most of the other reviewers with either the theatrical release or extended edition.Some elements from the book obviously had to be omitted or changed for cinematic reasons.  However, Jackson made many changes for no evident reason which detract from the coherence and internal logic of the original story.Case in point:  The Ride of the Rohirrim, one of the most dramatic events in the tale.  In Tolkien's account the attack succeeds due to stealth.  The riders arrive silently, orc scouts have been slain or scattered and the Black Captain's attention is focused solely on the city.  Suddenly, Theoden and his men savagely charge into the besieging army.  The orcs are thrown into terror and confusion as 6,000 mounted warriors unexpectedly smash into their ranks.  If, as Jackson depicts it, the orcs had been given time to turn their flank and set their pikes they would have been dining on Rohirrim that night in the halls of Minas Tirith.The number of other unfortunate departures from Tolkien is too great to usefully mention.  Just a few would include the silly avalanche of skulls in the haunted mountain, the dead king's last minute decision to fulfill his oath to Aragorn (hmm...would that qualify as a death bed conversion?), the laughable confrontation with the corsair ship, Gandalf's totally out of character bludgeoning of Denethor, Sam's swordplay in the tower of Cirith Ungol, the cartoonish scaling of a war mamluk by Legolas.....well, you get the idea.I don't insist that a movie must slavishly reproduce the book.  But why make changes that diminish the original story rather than improve it?  Perhaps creative people simply can't resist the urge to tinker.That said, Jackson's trilogy is still a spectacular achievement.  He faithfully adheres to the essence and general story line of the book and successfully creates a convincing Middle Earth.  And in fairness, only the most dedicated of Tolkien fans are likely to quibble over the differences.	4.0	A good movie that could have been better	2006-01-16	11	5	6

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1RECBDKHVOJMW	"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana"""	BRAVO and thank you Peter Jackson's for your absolutely awesome adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's epic &quot;Lord of the Ring Trilogy!&quot; I read these extraordinary books back in the 1960s, and never thought their amazing fantasy characters and complex story could be brought to life. You seem to have pulled off a cinematic miracle with &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; and your concluding piece, &quot;The Return of the King&quot; is near perfection. It is truly a jewel. For almost 3 years we have been waiting for the conclusion, the resolution to the saga. I got chills watching the movie - it is that vivid an experience. These three films are destined to become beloved classics, in the public's Movie Hall of Fame, if they are not already.The intrepid hobbits, Frodo, (Elijah Wood), Sam, (Sean Astin), and the creature Gollum, (Andy Serkis), are on the final leg of their mission to destroy the Ring in Mount Doom. Frodo is exhausted and the Ring continues to sap him of his strength with every footstep. Meanwhile, Gandalf the Wizard, (Ian McKellan), Aragorn the ranger, (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the elf, (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli the dwarf, (John Rhys-Davies), reunite with their hobbit friends Pippin, (Billy Boyd) and Merry, (Dominic Monaghan), in the wake of the battle of Isengard. Director Jackson tracks Frodo and his two companions through the terrible dangers and betrayals which confront them in Morder. At the same Gandalf and Pippin ride to the city of Minas Tirith to warn them against coming invasion. And Aragorn makes ready to lead his people against the forces of evil, and to announce himself as Isildur's heir, the returned King of Gondor.The Battle of the Pelennor Fields is one of the most exciting moments in my personal movie history. I felt like I was in the midst of the battle and actually got an adrenaline rush. The film moves at such a rapid pace that I totally lost track of time. Jackson has saved some of the film trilogy's best moments for last. The Siege of Minas Tirith and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields are super superb, edge-of your seat excellent movie moments. Frodo's triumph and the return of the king, the coronation, are, for me, the crowning glory.Elijah Wood no longer shines as Frodo. He is a thin, waif-like, shadow of the cheerful hobbit he once was. The boy has become a man who shoulders burdens most men could not bear. Wood's change is palpable and his acting wonderful. Sean Astin's affable Sam has become Frodo's fierce protector, ready to kill to defend his companion against the treacherous Gollum, and the darkness of Mordor. Viggo Mortensen plays Aragorn with the nobility and courage befitting a king. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies provide needed comic relief from all the intense action. Miranda Otto's Eowen is beautiful, and as fierce a soldier as any man on the battlefield. All in all, the acting is magnificent - a real achievement. However, this is ensemble acting at its best. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Finally, all the characters from the earlier films reunite ar the end for a last good-bye.I highly recommend &quot;The Return of the King' and the entire trilogy. I plan to rent all three over the next rainy weekend.JANA	5.0	A Memorable Masterpiece & Fitting Conclusion To The Trilogy	2004-08-01	8	5	3

Finally, my kids are old enough to enjoy the LOTR series with me and my husband so we were getting ready to have our LOTR marathon when lo and behold, I cannot find the DVDs! The only one finally found was LOTR- Two Towers and there is no way we would watch them in the wrong order. I quickly went to my go-to shopping site - Amazon.com - and found this and The Fellowship of the Ring for an awesome price! I purchased them and a few days later, we're having our marathon.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3SMONWE3T7UAZ	"Jane Freeman Wilson ""jjwilstex"""	Okay, so I started reading JR Tolkein when I was 14, and have read the LOTR trilogy at least 20 times since (I'm 42 now).  I also managed to force my way through The Silmarillion once, The Hobbit a couple of times (my 12yo son is reading it now), but the various other short stories didn't engage me at all.  So .. I have to admit that, although I have loved the series, I am deeply disappointed at how much has been left out/changed etc.  Even little things that made me just say &quot;why oh why?&quot; like the struggle between Frodo and Gollum at the end of the movie.  That is just incorrect.  I don't have the book here with me, but I clearly recall that Gollum bit Frodo's finger, off, danced around crying &quot;my precious, my precious&quot;, lost his balance, then plunged into the depths of Mount Doom.  What dramatic purpose did it serve for Frodo to struggle with Gollum?  Similarly, why was Arwen far too visible in The Fellowship .. and pretty much disappeared for the rest of the movie.  I won't go into how wrong it was to put her in the role of rescuing Frodo from the Ringwraiths!  Gosh, it makes me wish that I had millions and millions of dollars and could make about 5 movies - and include Tom Bombadill, and Glorfindel, and the VERY important scene between Gandalf and Saruman where Gandalf breaks Saruman's staff of council, showing that he has lost his power and Gandalf has taken his place.  The thing with the Palantir was just thrown in so messily - and having Treebeard say &quot;There is a wizard to deal with here&quot; and then ... wot, no confrontation!?  That was just plain weird.  Even my husband, who hasn't read the books, felt that something went astray there.  I also deeply regret that the Scouring of the Shires disappeared.  That was vitally important.  It truly evidenced how much changed the four Hobbits were by their journeying, and how they had matured and grown.  Their final confrontation with Saruman was excellent in the book .. entirely missing in the movie.  Ah well.  Still, beautiful scenery, good acting (although was I alone in being a little tired of Elijah Wood's &quot;constipated&quot; expression), fabulous sets and battles, and pretty good subtitles too.	5.0	So much missing ...	2004-06-04	7	5	2

The scenes are graphic. Giant elephants are used in battle. There are huge flying dragons reminiscent of the extinct pterodactyls. There is Shelob, the hideous giant man-eating spider.Frodo the hobbit has the responsibility of crossing into the Land of Mordor, and dropping the evil ring into the cauldron of Mount Doom. This is the only way to destroy the ring and King Sauron's lingering powers of evil behind it. Frodo is beset by the evil Gollum, who once committed a murder in order to acquire the ring for himself, and is secretly prepared to do the same to the unsuspecting Frodo. At one point, Shelob delivers a paralyzing sting to Frodo, and then wraps him in a cocoon. Frodo's doom seems sure, along with any possibility of destroying the evil ring. What will happen?Gandalf is a white-haired wise old man. Was Obi-Wan Kenobi of STAR WARS a knockoff of Gandalf? Mordor is close to the German word for murderer.

Tolkien's epic novel ""The Lord of the Rings"", but there isn't anything quite like watching an epic like this on the big screen.  All of the elements-- the score (by Howard Shore), the special effects, and the higher emotional content for ""The Return of the King"" are astounding and unbelievable!New Line Cinema, who distributes the Lord of the Rings movies, viewed the trilogy as an ""effects showcase"" but Peter Jackson is making sure that J.R.R. Tolkien's extremely emotional climax in ""The Return of the King"" is not labeled as a mere 'action film' or 'effects showcase'.  Although the battles will be amazing, they won't compare to the human element of emotion, grief, suffering, and triumph these characters experience in this climatic conlclusion.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A24N117YEQ7HHA	Jason	I was quite nervous about this film.  After all, I'd just seen the Matrix movies fall apart, and the Star Wars prequel trilogy was one of the biggest cinema let-downs in history.  And I've been reading Tolkien's work for over two decades; how could a film capture the essence of one of the most beloved books ever written?  The answer:  magnificently.Director Peter Jackson took the most complex book in the series, left out what he could and included what was absolutely necessary from the book, plus added a couple of scenes from previous books (the Gollum story and Shelob's lair), and has made one of the most incredible films I've ever seen.  My jaw actually dropped at times!  The special effects are absolutely astonishing; Gollum is as incredible as he was in The Two Towers, and Shelob (the giant spider) was quite frightening (not for small children!).Although I've given this film five stars, I don't feel it is quite perfect.  There were things in the book that I wanted to see in the film, such as Gandalf's confrontation with the Nazgul king, Faramir and Eowyn's romance, the scouring of the Shire at the end, and especially Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman, which was supposed to be at the end of TTT.  As long as this film was (3 hours 17 minutes), I still wanted it to be longer.  If you've read the books, you'll know from Tolkien's foreword that the biggest complaint about the written series is the same thing:  it's too short.  However, some of these missing scenes will be in the extended version, I hear, which I can't wait for.  The confrontation with Saruman was left out of the final print of the theatrical release because it detracted from the pacing of the film, but I thought it was a critical scene.  However, I was astonished by this film, and by the series, as I never have been before, and am actually a bit sad that it's over.Here's hoping they drive a truckload of money up to Peter Jackson's house and convince him to do a version of The Hobbit, and make the series complete.	5.0	Absolute masterpiece	2003-12-22	11	10	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ADGMIWM567TF7	Jason Homorody	This was my favorite of the three movies. The first was horrifically boring and I almost avoided any of the others because of it. Thankfully, i tried out two towers and it brought back my faith that these could be good movies. My only knock on this movie was-for the love of God, cut the last 30 minutes. It was like a relative who stays too long at a Christmas party-sure you were happy to see them earlier in the night, but now its late and its time for them to go. The last 30 minutes offered nothing except a complete waste of my time. So by averaging out the 5 stars the movie had in the first 3/4ths of the film with the 1 star for the last 30 minutes, i get a 4 star rating. I am still baffled by how this movie won best picture of the year though.	4.0	Good Movie, great effects, but please end the movie	2005-01-04	24	0	24
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2WSCMGYIMGVEY	"Jason Nieuwoudt ""Jason"""	"""The Return of the King"" exceeds all my expectations! I doubt that, considering the time and budget restraints, Peter Jackson and Co could have done a better job! Yes, there is the problem of Saruman and his sudden omission from the trilogy and yes some parts did in fact feel a little rushed! But as I previously stated I think they have done justice to Tolkien's story. Aragorn comes into his own and by the end of the movie he seems to possess an air of nobility that was previously lacking. The other characters also seems to contribute more, often giving hope to Gandalf in times of despair rather than vice versa!The opening scene is great and we get to see Gollum as he was before when he was one of the ""river folk"", Smeagol! It is also rather disturbing as we see him murder Deagol in a brutal scene that shows just how powerful and evil the power of the ring really is. The movie then goes from strength to strength. We see Aragorn walk the Paths of the Dead and enlist the help of the ""Oathbreakers"". We also get to see wonderful battle sequences that in my opinion are much better than the battle at Helm's Deep. Eowyn fights the Nazgul and the Witch KIng of Minis Morgul and Frodo and Sam have to deal with the bloated and disgusting Shelob. The ending was spectacular and way beyond my expectations, which were however not too great in the first place when I heard that the ""Scouring of the Shire"" was omitted. The Grey Havens and the final departure is moving and woderfully done. All in all a wonderfull adventure adaptation of a timeless masterpiece. I can't wait for the DVD extended edition and then sit down to about 10 hours of movie ecstacy while watching the trilogy in its entirety."	5.0	Have Just seen it and it's Great!	2003-12-16	5	4	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1MTW9XNYCQBGT	Jazz	I bought this package three days ago. I've had a bit of time on my hands and watched it pretty constantly. I STILL HAVE NOT SEEN EVERYTHING. Be warned, this is huge.Like the previous two extended editions,the ROTK offers a plethora of genuinely fascinating documentaries. The extended movie itself seemed to be a much better version. You would have to be a true hardcore fan to watch it all in a single sitting (I managed about three) but it is more gripping, more suspenseful and more entertaining than the already marvellous theatrical cut.You can understand Jackson's cutting of some scenes. The theatrical edition obviously achieved it's purpose, and you know while watching some of the deleted scenes that they simply would not have worked in the commercial cinema. But to be able to spread out, and take the time to fully appreciate the story, is a symbol of Jackson's perfect balance between the commercial needs of cinema and to demonstrate a genuine heart to what he calls 'the biggest home movie ever.'The documentaries do their best to please, but obviously to see all of them you will need to consider yourself quite a big fan. To me, at least, they all seemed to be very interesting. I was genuinely surprised. Who knew that a 30-minute documentary on all the horses would actually be very funny? It is, trust me.The best documentary by far is to be found on the last disc. The almost feature-length 'Cameras in Middle-Earth' explores the actors constructions of their scenes. This, to me, was the most interesting.The true miracle of these documentaries is that you feel like an observer into a family album. Obviously, the ending of the appendicies, and therefore the LOTR films forever, is quite emotional. Grab a hanky.I am no big fan of the original books, so I can't really comment on the adaptation. But I will say that the extended movie cut does seem like a more Tolkien version of events. However, the movies should never be seen as an attempt at Tolkien. It is an interpretation of Tolkien, and one that has done it's best to capture the spirit and essence of the books. I think it improved upon the story.Overall, buy this. It's excellent, wonderful and marvellous. Even if you don't consider yourself a huge fan, if you have a spare couple of days and you watch this, you'll probably end up being one.This film, in time, I'm sure will be considered a masterpiece of cinema. An absolute must-have. A relic of modern movie history.	5.0	Everything is under control	2004-12-11	7	0	7

Three mini documentaries are offered, each showing almost identical footage and interviews.  Otherwise, the viewer gets to see trailers and tv spots (does anyone actually find watching those ads to be entertaining?).  There are a few other forgettable featurettes.

Maybe you read the books at one time or another, and were disappointed about certain scenes that were left out.  If you are trying to decide between the extended versions versus the theatrical release versions, let me offer you this advice:1.  Get a very comfortable couch or lounger.2.  Get a really large bowl of popcorn and a large container of your favorite beverage.3.  Pay the extra money and get the Extended Versions of all three movies.I used to read the Trilogy every summer as a camp counselor (with no TV to watch it was a great way to fall asleep after a long day).  While I thoroughly enjoyed the theatrical releases, I always felt a bit, well, cheated.  There were so many scenes I thought crucial to the storyline that just had to be cut from the theatrical release to make it more time palatable.  However, I was greatly encouraged to see the extended versions picking up so many of these ""key"" scenes. I can hardly wait to see what the extra 50 minutes will include.  I felt that the final installment of the Trilogy unncessarily truncated (look it up) and felt that the Shire deserved a better ""wrap up"".  Also the extended version will also help shed light on the final character dispositions.If you don't own any of the extended versions, get them now.

"I don't know what Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens were smoking when they decided to cut out all these extra scenes from the theatrical version, but I'm telling you it was something potent. The theatrical version was far too scattered and jumpy, nothing flowed, and so many important parts from the book were missing. However, the extended version flows SO much better, and some of the best scenes were missing. (And don't use the ""oh then it would be too long"" argument, because if you can't sit down for a good 4 hours for LOTR, you don't deserve to watch it anyways.)And it should be a crime to tell the tale of Eowyn and not conclude it with her romance with Faramir. At least a misdemeanor. So let me tell you, don't watch the regular ROTK, only the extended, especially if you're a Tolkien fan. The only deleted scene that I'm really glad they deleted was the one with all the skulls falling out..yeah that was dumb.As for the retelling of ROTK in general: Mostly good, missed ALOT from the book (NEVER replace the book with the movie...NEVER) but understandably could not include everything.  However, they did make some boo-boos. The part where Sam and Frodo's friendship seemed comprised--hi, that went directly against the book and what Tolkien was communicating in their friendship. Quite blasphemous I tell you. Fast-forward that part.But I still respect the job they did, and although they don't do the book justice, the story is just so good that I had to give it a 5 stars.

The only scene that made my 9 year turn his head was when gollum bit into the fish.The first of the series LOTR's was a slightly better than average movie, but an excellent adaption of the books.  This trilogy actually gets better as it goes along.  Once I had both enjoyed and suffered through LOTR I, I was able to savor most of TWIN TOWERS, but there were parts that just made me want to take a nap.  I am not a fan of extremely long camera shots of facial expressions, especially given the limited range of expressions emotted by some of the hobbits in particular.

And loved it.The themes: timeless. So much to ponder, and every bit profound.The cost of sacrifice. Loyalty. The hand of providence. The reality of evil. Discovering one's purpose. Doing the right thing no matter the consequence. The hope of eternity. The humble are exalted. The truth that war between good and evil runs through every single heart.The difference between Harry Potter and LOTR is world view. Sure, both have fantastic sequences and imaginative stories. But one drifts in relativism and self-centeredness while the other is anchored in the concept of ultimate reality guided by providence.  Make no mistake, these concepts are simultaneously challenging and satisfying to consider.And I'm so very glad the ending was long. There were so many story line ""debts to pay"".

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ	"Jeff Edwards ""RadioJeff"""	Peter Jackson deserves some time off.  After watching the absolutely stunning 'Return of the King' it seems almost unbelievable that so MUCH of Tolkien's Trilogy could be caught so well on film.  I lost count of how many times my jaw just dropped at what I was seeing during this movie.  The more I learn about this movie trilogy, the more impressed I am.  Sure, there will always be those Tolkien purists who believe that straying from the books -- even by one single word is nothing short of blasphemy, but considering the sheer scope of what it took to bring these stories to the big screen (and sorry, but home viewing just doesn't do the movies justice), Peter Jackson could very well be the greatest film-maker of the past 30 years.  Not even Spielberg could have done a better job -- not without re-writing it into something that wouldn't even remotely resemble the original novels.  Jackson remains true to the Tolkien vision (at least he does in MY opinion) and gave us the true meat of these amazing tales.  For purposes that non film-makers usually do not attempt to understand, there are significant and valid reasons for deleting certain portions of the stories -- and yes, even creating entirely new scenes not found in the books.The final battle scenes at Minas Tirith almost defy my ability to describe and do justice.  I know of NO other film in ALL of history that depicts a battle of such scope even remotely as well (with the possible minor exception to the storming of Normandy Beach in 'Saving Private Ryan').  For one, I can't think of ANY film which even attempts to visually show such a battle with so many participants, whether they be computer generated or not.  Peter not only hit a home run with 'Return of the King' but a Grand Slam on the scope that has never been seen before.  Many have been calling this the greatest Film Trilogy ever created, and THAT is an understatement.  It would have been interesting had several film-makers sat down to make the Trilogy, but all independant of one another, just to see the vast differences in how the movies turned out.  I am 100% confident nobody could have done it better than Peter Jackson, the true visionary of our time.  I anxiously await to see what he has for us next -- after his well-earned vacation, of course.  In short, GO SEE THIS FILM.To go into detail on the movies HUGE number of special effects and shining moments would take up more time that I have here to describe.  A few that stand out would be Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli's recruiting of the Army that turns the tide of the battle of Minas Tirith...Frodo & Sam's battle to get INTO Mordor, and once there, making the difficult trek up to cast the One Ring into the cracks of Mt. Doom...Legolas' almost single handedly changing the course of the battle for Minas Tirith in his never-ending challenge to one-up Gimli...Gandalf and Pippen and their part in forcing an alliance with Gondor, and how Pippen becomes a man--er, adult Hobbit all because of one crucial mistake...the schizophrenic life of Gollum and how twisted he has become as a result of his association with the One Ring over such a long period of time and how he plots -- with himself, no less -- to win it back at ALL costs.  It was a true bitter-sweet moment at the end in the final scene when the Fellowship is finally broken for the last time as Bilbo & Frodo along with Gandalf take their leave of Middle Earth with the Elfs out to sea.Overall, I would have to say that my favorite character in the movies has to be Samwise Gamgee.  Sean Astin is to be commended for playing this complicated near-simpleton and give him such depth and compassion.  His sworn oath to help Frodo, even at the cost of his own life is a beautiful thing that Peter Jackson has brought to the screen.  Many say the film is too long, but I for one believe the movie ended all too soon and I very much look forward to the extended edition on DVD of this film to see what else we can expect from Middle Earth that because of time had to be cut from the film.In short, these films and specifically 'Return of the King' will go down as some of my personal favorite of all-time and I can hardly wait to see it again on the big screen (and I can't even remember the last film I saw twice in the theaters...), in short this is a visual Masterpiece of incomparable movie-making at its absolute finest.	5.0	A visual Masterpiece -- incomparable movie-making...	2003-12-30	10	9	1

The scene at the Black gates involving the Aragorn & the Troll was originally supposed to be Sauron in the troll's stead. I won't waste time and space in saying the synopsis of this film, other than Lord of the Rings goes out with a bang. In this extended edition you get additional scenes from the book and some other cool ones; as well as massively in-depth bonus materials. True Lord of the Rings fans will agree with Peter Jackson: the theatrical version WAS too short.

Second, I have to congratulate the fans who have been to each of the showings these past 3 winter movie seasons! That said, I'm wholly satisfied that the series has ended.""Return of the King"" brings Tolkien's third and final book of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to the big screen, an adaptation allowing viewers' eyes an chance to realize Frodo's quest to destroy the seed of greed and evil in middle earth, the one ring and its master, Lord Sauron! Through this final installment fans get to close the stories on friends made in each of the previous movies. Truly rewarding!What can I say? Fans of the three novels by and large won't be dissappointed. In fact, the movies serve as a visual epic, bringing the reader's imagination to life! The artistry not only in CG/Special Effects form, but also in the relationships between the actors climax throughout the movie. From the first view of Minas Tirith, to the Battle of Pelennor Fields and Olyphants, Nazgul and Eagles to the relationships that mature between all main characters in the movie. I can't really highlight any performances as all are spectacular. Furthermore, the magnitude of the ensemble cast does not allow much character focus, save for Frodo and Sam, whose portrayal by Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are far deeper than any of the two previous installments. The audience certainly will go through emotional highs and cheers will erupt from the crowd!Perhaps, those emotional highs and cheers serve as a forwarning to watching this movie. ""Return of the King"" is about 3 hours and 15 minutes long! You'll easily find yourself cheering two thirds of the way through the movie wrought with excitement and fervor. However, be wise in spending your emotional energy. Many don't realize that after the cheering, the true climax and an hour of movie are still left! There is where the reader benefits. Nonetheless, the movie should come with a disclaimer: spend emotional energy wisely, ration or else you may find yourself unenthusiastic after all the cheering!No movie is complete without some criticisms. The main one being some quirky editing early on in the movie which advances the story line quite rapidly, some viewers may feel rushed. Also, I won't ruin it for you, however, one of larger, more significant storylines from ""The Two Towers"" was left on the cutting floor; obviously fuel for buying the DVD version when it finally comes out. No biggie. However, the movie stays true to the novel, even to the end!After everything, having left the theater you feel as if you've completed the journey with Frodo and his fellowship. Rewards are aplenty and you'll likely be contemplating the magnitude of the story for quite some time after (maybe enough to pick up the books)!

There is no doubt in my mind that this cut is much better than the one seen in theaters, and I recommend you buy this. All the added and extended scenes were very good, but when it came right down to it, Jackson failed to include The Scouring of the Shire. Of all of the scenes that should have been added, this was it. It is important to know that the Shire had changed, and the returning hobbits had to correct the changes that occured. From my point of view, this single exclusion ruined this cut. It was the one scene that I looked forward to seeing the most, but it was not there. Despite thsi disappointment, you should not turn your back on this edition, because it is very good, I'm just really picky. Picky enough where I could write a fifty page paper to Peter Jackson on how he screwed up, but that is another tale. Definetely buy this, it's worth every penny.	4.0	Close, but no cigar.	2004-12-19	7	2	5
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1CMP62SUNPN	Jeffrey Bower	"Enchanting, Exciting, Enthralling and Saddening... these are just a few terms, which describe Peter Jackson masterpiece, ""The Lord of The Rings:  The Return of The King"".  ""Return of The King"" is the last in a Trilogy of brilliance.In this final chapter, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gammchi (sorry if the name is misspelled), bring their epic adventure to an end.  The characters, which so many have become fond of, have now truly begun to fulfill their role.  With this last movie, the inner struggle of Frodo can be seen, and the outer struggle for Mankind reaches its climatic ending.  Weakened from the ring, Frodo now has trouble fighting its dark power, while Samwise fights to prove the disloyalty of Gollum.  While Frodo and Samwise fight for there very survival, a similar fight is happening at Minas Tirith; mankind's last stand against the armies of Sauron.This final chapter of the trilogy, brings the story to a closure, and ensures itself as a timeless classic.  The movie is brilliant, and captures all the essences, which make an amazing movie.  The ""Return of The King"" brings the struggles of Good vs. Evil and Life vs. Death to full boil.  The movie, albeit being 3 1/2hrs long (be sure to visit the bathroom first, and bring lots of popcorn), keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire time.  What keeps you on the edge of your seats?  Well, the struggles above really pull that off.  Throughout the movie, you are in constant wondering, to what will happen to Frodo/Samwise and the other companions (fighting at Minas Tirith).The battle scenes are amazing, and most of the graphics are breathtaking.  For example, just about everyone in the audience were in awe over the shear size of Minas Tirith.  It was amazing, and gave you a sense of power making you think, ""Man!!!  Maybe mankind has a chance within the walls of Minas Tirith"".  Gollum is yet again an amazing graphical feat of the movie.  Although one realizes Gollum is nothing but a 3d model, the life that is given to him is amazing.  The facial features are excellent, and the inner struggle of Smegal and Gollum, bring this character to life.  Watching the discussions between Gollum and Smegal unfold, one may feel amusement/pity towards him (or them for that matter).The only factor, which may anger some, is the artistic license on the movie.  The movie, for the most part, follows the book however; Jackson takes some artistic licensing and changes some things, and leaves out other.  I understand why Jackson left out some, if he did not, the movie would have been much longer.  Although there are slight changes, they are not nearly enough to disrupt the greatness of the movie.There has been debate to whether this ending/trilogy will surpass that of ""Star Wars"" or ""The Godfather"".  Personally, I cannot tell you if it does surpass them or not.  Whether it is proven to be or not, this movie will be a timeless classic, shared and watched throughout the years.  This is the best movie of 2003, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the other movies to this Trilogy.  I give ""Return of The King"" a solid 5 stars."	5.0	Timeless	2003-12-18	1	1	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3B2NVTP78WHUE	Jeffrey Rickel	"I waited with great trepidation three years ago when The Fellowship of the Ring was released.  I had read The Lord of the Rings over a dozen times (once a year since I was in middle school) and was convinced that it could never be successfully adapted for film - especially as a live action movie.  I had seen Bakshi's disaster, so plodding and uninteresting that I could not bear it more than once.  I had seen the Rankin/Bass version of The Hobbit and The Return of the King.  All of these tellings had me thoroughly convinced that I would not ever see a strong adaption for Tolkien's works on the silver screen - yet I yearned for one.  There's something innately satisfying about books being made into film if done well, but there was a creeping doubt in my heart about any adaptation.  An even greater when arose when someone I never heard of began making the movies.  Couldn't they have gotten Spielburg or someone with a solid Hollywood track record.  Happily, I was very wrong in this instance.  Peter Jackson is the only one who could have done it.So, here at last is the Extended Edition of Return of the King.  Taken in as a whole, the film is magnificent on it's own - but as a piece of the puzzle it is all the more extraordinary.  The Lord of the Rings is the greatest accomplishment in cinematic history.  With the three films, Jackson has managed to do what many thought impossible: successfully translate the greatest book of the 20th Century to screen.  From the casting, to the effects, to the script, to the selection of the composer (Howard Shore's scores are brilliant - all the more so because he's not attempting to be John Williams) everything is amazing.The extended cut of RotK adds quite a bit of depth and changes the pacing.  True, some tension is taken away by adding more to the Paths of the Dead but we also get some added excitement and tension during that phase.  We see more of Denethor and Faramir's tale.  We see the sadness of Eowyn.  We see Saruman's arrogance and Wormtongue's hatred of him.  I certainly prefer the extended cut - especially because it allows you to stay in middle earth for an extra fifty minutes, though sadness still grips you at the Grey Havens, as it should.The extras here are up to par with the other sets.  Hours and hours of info on Tolkien, on making the films, on wrapping them up, and the story about the inspiration to the beautiful song that closes out the film, ""Into the West"".  A touching story about a young film maker who's life is taken by cancer.  You can see PJ tearing up towards the end, and that really says it all.It took great heart to make this movie (I'm talking about all three partitions in one).  Thank you to PJ, Fran, and everyone at New Line who stepped out with the cash at the beginning.  You have been rewarded for your faith - as has the rest of the movie watching world.  Most of all, however, Professor Tolkien must be thanked for his great contribution to literature and imagination.  He was a wonderful writer who, I think, never understood it when his works became so popular.  His understanding of the world played a huge part.So, in conclusion, buy this DVD.  You already know whether you like Lord of the Rings or not.  If you're here, you likely do - so buy it if you haven't already!"	5.0	Greatest Accomplishment in Film History	2004-12-27	11	8	3

Hogan ""Jeff"""	"I was extremely excited about this release for well over a year.I thoroughly enjoyed the theatrical release, loose threads and all.  I was glad to see those threads tied together and fleshed out in the extended versions.However, for the ROTK extended edition, the addition of most of the new material is extraneous and in some ways damaging to the flow of the film.  (Fran Walsh eludes to as much in the commentary).A few examples:The addition of the ""house of healing"" storyline is far too minimal.  It's certainly a nod to us who enjoyed the books, but does not work in context of the film as it is presented.The blooming tree in Gondor lessens the dramatic tension in the film and fore-shadows, too soon, the outcome of the siege.Eowyn, gets an extra scene with Merry, which while interesting, leaves one wondering why someone failed to mention to the king that his niece was riding with them disguised as a man.  This gaffe weakens her scenes later on, especially when she is ""discovered"" laying injured on the battle field.It is extra material like this, while enjoyable to watch, that left me feeling like I wish I could create my own edit of the film.Some of it was great and sorely missed, most left me thinking that they went too far.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	The best was definitely saved for last, as the Return of the King ends the great Tolkien trilogy in grand and spectacular fashion.  In this installment, Frodo (Elijah Wood) is continuing his journey to Mordor to destroy the One Ring of Power in the lava fields of Mt. Doom.  Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), heir to the kingdom of Men endures a tremendous battle at Minas Tirith with the help of his loyal friends Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and, of course, Gandalf (Ian McKellen).Frodo and Sam must also survive the deceptions of Gollum (Andy Serkis), who is trying to steal the ring for himself.After watching the first two installments of the trilogy, I have been eagerly anticipating the release of The Return of the King, and the wait was well worth it.  The special effects in this movie are simply unbelievable.  The battle scenes at Minas Tirith surpass those of Helm's Deep in The Two Towers, and the new creatures are really cool.I'm truly sorry to see this wonderful trilogy come to an end.  As a fantasy movie and book fan, I can only hope that another series of movies will come along that are as good as this series is.  Needless to say, I give this movie, and the whole series, my highest recommendation.  The acting and special effects are superb, and the action is non-stop.

Shimkus ""Movie Manji"""	Peter Jacksons adaptation of jrr tolkiens masterpiece of fantasy writing is equally masterful in the cinematic sense.  I am a great fan of the first two and the third is really a great way to end this generations greatest movie trilogy.  Altough avid fans of the books will find great changes from the pages they have come to adore from Tolkien.  The ending is sharply cut from the book in favor of the great action scenes that dominate this movie.  Instead of a movie about hobbits, you really get the sense that the movie is torn between the war and the supposed main theme, the hobbits.  The two fight each other for screen time and I really think the computer animated war sequences won.  Don't get me wrong, it's what every viewer out their has been looking forward to, but like i said, great deviations from the third book.  For instance, where is the closure with sauruman, he just gets swept away sort of.  You don't even see the breaking of his staff, which is the source of all his power.  You don't see how the war effected hobbiton.  Yes, Frodo, Sam, Pippen, and Merry come home to something a lot different than the same old Hobbiton that they remembered and so fought for to protect, like an innocent child from the harsh truth of the world.  All things regarding the book's translation aside, watch it for what it is, a good movie with great actors and a great script.  See it for all the things you heard the critics say, at least the good things, because it is a good long movie.	5.0	Theatrical release	2004-01-31	1	1	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	Peter Jackson's Epic (and I do mean Epic in every sense of the word) is brought to a close in this third installment of the series.  The movies closing is more then just an ending, it displays the changes that take place in the lives of these people who have fought so hard to save the world as they know it.As in the two towers, this movie picks up where the last one left off.  And again, the pace moves swiftly.  Urgency is key, events are taking place that can destroy the human race.  The ring that must be destroyed is still in the hands of Frodo, who is constantly being manipulated by the insane Gollum, desperate and obsessed with reclaiming the ring.  His treacherousness is beyond compare.  It's very clear he is carefully plotting the demise of the two Hobbits he is guiding.  The movie offers more depth to his background as well, showing the reason why Frodo, seemingly against better judgment, attempts to appeal to his former personality.The Human armies move again to the Palace city of Minas Tirith, where the final battle takes place.  Here the battle is led by Gandalph, highlighted by the skills of Aragorn and Legalos, as well as a huge army of humans and ghosts showing up at just the right time.Return of the King takes a few more liberties with the original story but still does not disappoint.  The movie is technically splendid.  It's obvious that this movie could not have been done on the same scale until now, when the technology was up to date.  The entry of a ghost army and the creatures and orcs that make up the villain hordes are overwhelming but believable.The ending is bittersweet, showing how some of these characters must go back to their previous existence, and finding it a strange feeling considering what they had been through.  Although a little long, it is faithful to the ending in the novel and makes sense considering the long journey we have taken with these characters.	5.0	Wrapping up a Masterpiece	2004-11-19	19	16	3
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1OXL504FLKU5L	Jemmy Wen	Return of the King is the final chapter of the Lord of the Ring trilogy which I think is the best of three movies. This movie is way too intense so that three and half hour is not enough. Peter Jackson is 100% loyality to the book, but I think there is something &quot;miss&quot; in the movie and the book. The end is too dramatic, because the fellowship only has one loss (Boromir). The other eight are survive. I always wonder why make the Fellowship of the Ring movie is so successful. The one main reason is when Gandalf falls into the shawdow and Boromir's death scene. Everybody can feel the emotion and grief in it. And that's make me wonder what if Merry's sacrifice at the Battle of the Pelennor Field? Pippen's sacrifice for save Gandalf or Aragon at battle of Blackgate? And even Frodo falls into the Mount Doom with Gullom?(because I don't believe you can grip something when you fight someone and falls). Then let Sam survive. Really, the end of the LOTR book is too perfect for 50's to 80's, but it looks too dramatic at modern day.For these of us who had read the LOTR books know that Sauron has 500,000 strong army, but men (Gonder and Rohan) only have less than 40,000 army. So when they have confrontation, you can't have all 6 main characters (Gandalf, Aragon, Gimli, Legolas, Pippen, Merry) survive from all three tough battle like siege of Gondor, Pelennor Field and Blackgate. Because people will not feel how tough and how important these battles are for main characters only if minor soliders died. Even King Theodon's death can't make a difference.	5.0	What if there are more heroically tragic?	2004-06-03	4	1	3

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AVTMGIC0C05B5	Jennifer Miller	The extended movie includes scenes that are meant just for interest, for further explanation of things, and to tie up some loose ends, and it is done very well. I was especially stoked to see the footage of Saruman and Wormtongue included in this version of the movie, as well as a little bit more about the relationship between Faramir and Eowyn. It rounded out the story a bit more and I hardly even noticed the 4 hours it took to get from start to finish.The Appendices are, as with the first two movies, wonderfully informative. Not only do they include some of the more technical information on how scenes were created and such, but they include personal experiences and stories from the cast and crew that make you actually feel the bond they shared while filming these three movies.It's a great story and I think Peter Jackson and his crew have done an amazing job in putting it on film.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A35ZX0UAQS26TE	Jeremiah Cross	How do you turn a dumb kiddie story into an &quot;epic quest&quot;? Simple, make it big, make it long, make it scary, and make it three times. Frantically cut back and forth between storylines, so nobody notices how drawn-out and repetitive each one is. Use made-up languages and subtitles to hide how boring the dialogue would be in English. Create a love story out of thin air. Every moment of alleged suspense with another character and his army showing up out of nowhere and saving the day.&quot;The Lord of the Rings trilogy&quot; will have you pounded to your seat not for it's cinematic value but a tool for not taking any bathroom breaks. Because any bathroom breaks for an &quot;epic&quot; like this is sacrilage.Peter Jackson, terrible schlock flimmaker turned Oscar winner out of nowhere may've crafted an overrated trilogy that passed under the radar of mediocrity and dared to be classic. Other trilogies or quadrilogies like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, and even &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot; have exhibited maker's creativity, ideals, conviction, and tribute to other films of past generations while each created cultural phenomenons.&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy doesn't have any of it, it's nothing more than a blockbuster melodrama. Like J.K.K. Tolkien and George Lucas of right now, Peter Jackson indulges in a fabricated success that proves he thinks he's invincible. He is a filmmaker who hasn't improved and nurtured his skills through his cult and blockbuster days unlike Sam Raimi, James Cameron, and even John Carpenter. The Oscar for best director is a good debatable shield but &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; wasn't awarded the best movie of the year.Flamer Kopf: Note that the title for the review is &quot;Review from a negative point of view&quot;. As in a reverse psychology for a positive review. But since you got all sentimental, let me clarify. First of all, in my review I never attacked LOTR for being a greater success than The Matrix trilogies. I never really compared anything much about the success of the flim to the others. Second, I never nagged on about the trilogy getting that much Oscars. One the joke of the reverse review was &quot;terrible schlock filmmaker turned Oscar winner out of nowhere&quot; and used that as an insult throughout. So don't flame me just because I have a completely different opinion.	2.0	Review from a negative point of view.	2004-07-13	31	3	28

Shelob was better than OK, but by the time you get to her you've already been so special-effect numbed that....The destruction of the ring tends to go on and on a bit, but after waiting for three years...yep, I'm satisfied.I also liked the army of the dead.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2WBNVWTSD5YJ7	"Jess ""Tolkien Fan"""	After  being a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings books for the last 10 years (keeping in mind that I am only 20), these movies have continued my love for both Tolkein and Peter Jackson (if anyone out there has not seen the Frighteners, Heavenly Creatures or Dead Alive, I would highly recommend them). Maybe it is just pride for my country, being a kiwi myself, or a love for cinema, but seeing these films in the cinema completely blew me away, and each year left me waiting with baited breath for the next. Unfortunately, the trilogy has ended, but we still have the extended DVD to look forward to, and if the two previous ones are anything to go by (and I firmly believe that they are), this one will be even better.Now, onto the unfortunate topic of EMAN, after reading the reviews on the first page, I was unable to understand the fuss that everyone was making, so I sought out his review.Shocking though it may be to you, not all LOTR fans are male, and not all of us only watch it for the gorgeous men (though they are wonderful, and they can act).  Did it ever occur to you that in an epic adventure of this sort, there is not much room for romance and women, but they do play a role in all that is happening. It is todays society that prevents men from forming the close, loving friendships that women are renowned for. Why go on about masculinity? Why not just accept these relationships for what they are?In an entire list of reviews, almost all have given glowing comments, in my opinion, EMAN just wanted to create some controversy. Maybe his life is so small that he has to get his childish kicks somehow, and this is one of those ways. Perhaps he reads all of this, and the reaction from everyone else makes him feel needed. How about we all just let this poor, lonely man alone, and stop giving him what he craves, the attention of total strangers over the internet.ps.

There was a little bit of everything; romance between Aragon and Arwen, tons of bloody action, and an excellent plot (perhaps that's because I read the book, though). After watching the DVD, my opinions have only been enhanced. Many of the new scenes really do add that extra layer of depth I wanted, although I was dissapointed at the Mouth of Sauron scene, where (SPOILER!) Aragorn kills the Mouth of Sauron  (END SPOILER). That scene seemed to detract from the overall kingly impression I had of Aragorn, but it is a small trifle in such a great film.The disks have excellent video quality, and the sound is, once again, superb. The 3rd and 4th disks have some very engrossing documentaries which really add some light to how the movie was made, and the sheer manpower that took to make it.Overall, 5 Stars, because I was totally enthralled with it.And in response to a previous reviewer, Gollum was entirely CG, so I fail to see how a ""zipper"" could be showing during costume changes.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A4Q6F1RGQ2WWM	Jimmy	This movie is just badass. From start to finish. By far my favorite film of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy but that's not short changing the first two films which are also awesome. This film wouldn't be as exciting if it wasn't for the first two films so DO NOT skip to this film first without watching Fellowship and Two Towers. This is the climax to one of the greatest Trilogies ever put on film and to watch them out of order would be cinema blasphemy and doing a real disservice to yourself.I know a lot of people complained that there were &#34;too many endings&#34; to this film but an epic of this scope needed closure on multiple levels and you'll get that. Too many times you're left wondering what happened to certain characters or wishing you could have seen a particular scene that is only alluded to by the film makers. You want get that here since every single loose end is tied up.This film won a best picture Oscar and there's a reason why. The effects on the creatures and the fight scenes are all top notch, the performances from every single actor is outstanding especially Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood. It's so rare for the third film in a trilogy to actually deliver in every aspect possible and this film completely does that.If you love action, adventure or sword & sorcery films then this is for you. If you love movies that feature monsters and creatures getting their asses handed to them by badass human beings then this is definitely for you. There's everything from evil goblins, to giant spiders, to massive trolls and ghosts. The ending battle is one of the greatest fights ever put on film so if you're into action this is definitely for you.Cant recommend this enough to anyone who even just like movies in general. Great, great film.	5.0	Instant CLASSIC. Best of the trilogy.	2013-11-27	0	0	0

The featurettes are very short and don't really give any insight on anything we don't already know.  The two in-depth documentaries aren't any different from one another.  They both cover the same topics and show the same interviews.  The National Geographic documentary is interesting though isn't anything worth remembering a few years down the road.There are no music videos (probably didn't bother making one) or previews on the extended edition coming soon (disappointment).  And of course, you get the EA Games ads and trailers.Still, like I said before, this DVD will do for now until the Extended Edition is released!

The Return of the King is just fantastic while being faithful to the book as well. It only doesn't do Sauruman justice in the end. Christopher Lee who is great in the role isn't in the movie at all. In the book he comes back and takes over the Shire and I loved that. The movie is still great though even if it cut a very good part out. Hopefully we'll get that in the special edition or at least some sort of appearence by Sauruman.The movie is very long as it is, so I see why they didn't have that anyway. Everyone involved has a lot to do. Even the Hobbits have a huge part in this one. Frodo and Sam have to fight off a huge Spider that Gollum hopes will kill them. Merry gets to fight in battle in alongside Eowyn who feels for him that he wants to fight and no one will let him. Pippen looks into Sauruman's ball ""which is all of him that we get"" and the eye sees him and thinks he has the ring. So Gandalf has to take him away from Merry and the others and protect him. Pippen isn't just being protected by Gandalf the whole time though, he does what he can to help.We also get to see how Gollum became to taken over  by  the power of the ring. He was actually a hobbit named Smeagol. Gollum is at his most evil in this one as he trys to turn Frodo against Sam. There's just so much in the movie to mention and it's all great stuff. The action is unbelieveable as is the visual effects that  actually out do the effects of the last 2 films. If any two actors should be nominated for the film it should actually be Elijah Wood and Sean Astin who do their best work here. Also John Noble as Denethor gives an oscar worthy performance as well. Of course most of all it deserves best picture because it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. It even deserves the nomination more than the last two and unlike those it should win. Finally Peter Jackson deserves that best director Oscar!"	5.0	The Best in the trilogy and one of the best movies ever!	2003-12-20	5	4	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A8ACIUIAFNB5Y	"JJ ""garak84"""	In considering movies like this, one really has to look at them from two different persepectives: as a movie in and of itself, and seperately as an adaptation of the original book. Simply as a movie, Return of the King, even in its rather rushed theatrical version, is a spectacular film, easily five stars, and the extended edition neatly plugs several holes in the storyline, such as the fate of Saruman.As an adaptation of the book, however, it's a mixed bag at best, although I'd say you have to give it four stars just for not being a muddled disaster, which it easily could have been. Being a long-time fan of Tolkien, not only as an entertaining story-teller, but also as a formidable master of the English language, I came into all three films from the point of view of comparing them to the original books. The various changes in the first two movies are jolting at times, but are understandable as being necessary to condense the story and make certain aspects of it easier to understand for a more casual audience. However, the changes in the Return of the King really baffle me, since they seem thrown in for no apparent reason and do little to improve the story. (Like the weird lighting shifts at the Battle of the Pelenor Fields or the changed dialogue in Eowyn's confrontation with the Witch-King.) Some of it seems less thought out alteration than just general sloppiness on the part of the director and the crew. Having characters talk about how dark it is when it's clearly as bright as mid-day on the screen makes it harder to take them seriously, in my opinion. I also find the portrayal of Gimli to be incredibly irritating. John-Rhys Davies does an excellent job with the role, bringing the character wonderfully to life, but the script he's given turns the serious character of Gimli into a bufoon. Dwarves as comic relief is an unfortunate aspect of contemporary fantasy literature which Jackson has grafted onto Tolkien's work, dumbing down what was originally a serious story-arc about the relationship between Dwarves and Elves and the overcoming of mistrust between very different peoples. Inexplicable little things like this make this my least favorite of the three films by a rather wide margin.Those complaints aside, the movie does do a number of things remarkably well. The portrayal of Minas Tirith is amazing, and looks just right. Likewise, the troubled relationship of Faramir and Denethor is done masterfully, now that it's been fleshed out in the Extended Edition. I would have liked to see more explanation of Denethor's madness (as per the book), but the overall story doesn't suffer much from its lack. Gollum looks great (It's really hard to believe he's done in CG), and his whole story line is well-done on screen. I know some were upset by the absense of the Scouring of the Shire bit, but that whole sequence would have added another 30-60 minutes onto an already lengthy film. Most people simply wouldn't sit through all that. (Honestly, I don't even think I would, and I've read the trilogy about eight times.) Otherwise, the Extended Edition greatly enhances the story (I think these additions were the most meaningful of the three films.) Saruman's final scene, Gandalf's confrontation with the Witch-King, the Houses of Healing, and the Mouth of Sauron all get thrown in. Saruman's scene is my personal favorite, even though it is shortened and altered from the book version. I must admit to being somewhat disapointed with Gandalf's scene, which is one of my favorites in the entire trilogy, but at least it made it in. I couldn't believe it was left out of the theatrical version, since it is a rather important moment in the story, not to mention a very dramatic one.In any case, while Return of the King is still my least favorite of the three, this version is far better than the theatrical in just about every way.	4.0	A vast improvement over the theatrical release	2005-01-16	9	6	3

Lindsay	"In the third piece of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, we see the climax errupt in epic battle, individual myppic struggle, and the personal persuance of destiny.  Unfortunately, these threads are dissplayed amist excessive melodrama, leaving the audience feeling bloated and glad when it's over.The movie starts out well, showing the decline of Smeagol/Gollum, but when we see the fantastic make-up job done with Gollum -- extremely creepy -- we wonder why they didn't use the make-up the entire way through.  It made for a better effect, and really left the audience at ill-ease with the creature, making the cuteseied up cartoon seem inadequate.The movie travelles along the line of deus et machina with Aragorn finding the help he needs to defeat Saurons army fortunaltey right next to his camp sight.  How lucky!  When we see his army, we feel we've jumped into Disney's Pirates of the Caribean, with Aragorn pontificating rediculas dialogue with rediculas flare.  ""We suffer no-one to pass.""  ""You shall suffer me.""  Is that the best the writers can do.  I guess so.The movies does make good use of effects, but by the half way point, which is almost two hours into it, we get into Matrixesque excess, with the riders of Rohan taking on a parade of Elephants without any strategy save for seeing how quickly they could deminish their own numbers...?  The only King I see is the king of Idiots!By near end of it, we see giant eagles, who can battle wrathes in air, save Frodo and Sam, which begs us to ask, why didn't the eagles just fly Frodo there in the first place?  Would have saved a lot of strife...for everyone.  Oh well, a bad ending for a ten hour movie seems to be okay to eveyone else.From there we go into a forty five minute denouement with a triumphant score to extreme close ups shot in slow motion, where we hope, and hope again and again that it will, one day, end.  It had even the most devout fan growning.With flaw upon flaw -- Aragorn rallies the troops with, for some reason, hair extentions, giving the worst speach ever written while he and his captains are riding horses, then having all the horses simpy dissapear in the next shot -- the movie makes you wonder if all the great reviews and oscar nominations were for this or another movie called Return of the King.

Jackson took a masterpiece and destroyed it in every conceivable way, from the way he perverted the storyline, to the insipid script, the horrible acting, the lack of dramatic buildup and the surprisingly weak special effects. From the beginning, with the very unrealistic-looking scene of Smeagol being towed along by a fish, it was obvious that Jackson dropped the ball. Having no choice but to see the whole movie, I watched as he completely cut out one of the most dramatic and significant scenes in the whole story-the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf- and then gave incredibly short shrift to the meeting of the Ents, Gandalf, Theoden, etc. and the finding of the Palantir. The movie also featured some really bizarre plot and character changes: Theoden's initial refusal to aid Gondor, Denethor's complete character transmogrification from a wise, but despairing king into a barbaric fool, the silly decision to shove the Arwen character down out throats in every other scene, the asinine plot innovation of having Frodo and Sam feud, etc. Then there were scenes which just were laughably bad. The lighting of the signal fires was very unrealistic. The attack on Minas Tirith was nowhere near as impressive as the Battle of Helm's Deep in Two Towers. The Army of the Dead looked like something from Ghostbusters or Pirates of the Caribbean. And the final assault on Mordor was pitiful and undramatic, with a rather comical Eye of Sauron looking on. I could go on and on. This movie reeked, in every way and Tolkien fans should not reward Peter Jackson by buying this movie, especially since that con man is only going to come out with an extended version later on in the summer.	1.0	A crime against Tolkien	2004-07-29	68	25	43
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A15TGJVTMNH0MW	"J. Moon ""terrapinjer03"""	"I have to say, I was a little let down. I realize that Hollywood must alter and adapt books in order to logistically make them work on screen. Plus there are parts of the Return of the King novel that will bore you to tears. However, I was a little disappointed to have the scouring of the Shire cut... It just gives you that closure with Saruman that you really need. I also had a problem with the 9 endings that just seemed to go on and on and on... Really, we could've stopped with the ship sailing to the west with the nice sunset, but no, we get Sam's musings on family life in the Shire.Okay, enough with the negative. This is a great movie. I can't give it five stars though, because it is only part of a whole, and to watch only Return of the King would leave you missing something. I suggest you do what I will do when this comes out on DVD. Take the Day off of work, watch the Expanded Editions of Fellowship and Two Towers, then pop this one in. Yes, that is ten hours of Tolkien, and it is likely that my eyes will rot out of my skull, but that is the way this was meant to be viewed.My personal favorite, is the battle on the fields of Pelinnor. This was my favorite sequence from the book, and I think Peter Jackson did a wonderful job capturing it in detail. I don't like that he cut the romance between Faramir and Eowyn, but I think that's coming back from the cutting room for the Expanded edition. The stunning visual effects for Shelob reinforced my already ardent fear of spiders, and I absolutely love every screenshot and back drop employed.Yes, I am a Tolkien nerd, but I can easily say that though there are some inconsistencies, no one could ever do a better job creating this cinematically than Peter Jackson and Co. has done. All three movies encapture the personalities of the characters, peoples, and lands of Middle Earth so that Tolkien would be proud. If you do not feel inspired to succeed when all hope is lost, then you have missed the entire point of the movie. If you do not stand up wanting to cleave the arms off the nearest orc, than you have missed the point. If, for the next week after seeing this, you do not walk around saying ""Stupid FAT Hobbit!"" then you just aren't human.I love this trilogy."	4.0	The greatest 1/3 of a movie of the past fifty years	2004-04-22	8	7	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	APRU373UYVK2Y	J. N. Mohlman	"Evaluating the three films of the ""Lord of the Rings"" presents the reviewer with a bit of a conundrum.  By what standard should they be judged?  To hold them to the standard of the text would be absurd because it is simply impossible to reduce it to nine, or even twelve hours of film.  However, with such a beloved classic, one does have the right to expect a certain adherence to the spirit of the work, something which was superbly captured in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"".  Unfortunately, ""Return of the King"" drifts further and further from the themes of Tolkien's works, and while it is still an excellent film, it doesn't quite live up to the expectations set by the first two films in the trilogy.Nonetheless, the film has more to commend it than not, so I will begin with the positives.  First, one cannot discuss these films without considering the visual effects, and once again, ""Return of the King"" leaves the viewer with jaws agape.  From enormous Mumakil to breathtaking battle scenes involving tens of thousands of characters, the movie is a visual triumph.  At the same time, though, Jackson has once again wisely subverted visual elements into a more personal story, thereby avoiding the empty-headedness that often plagues special effects extravaganzas.In particular, his portrayal of Theoden and Eowyn is masterful.  Every one of their scenes is dripping with Tolkien's language and themes, and  both Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto provide scene stealing performances.  Hill, with his portrayal of a king tormented frailty and loss captures a Theoden that is almost Shakespearean in his bearing.  Likewise, Otto becomes Eowyn as she seeks to subsume her unrequited love for Aragorn in death on the battlefield.  Eowyn's showdown the Witch King is perhaps the best scene of all three films, with Otto absolutely pouring herself out onto the screen.Other highlights include the portrayal of Frodo and Sam's brutal passage of the Plains of Gorgoroth and their ascent of Mount Doom.  Grace through suffering was a critical element in Tolkien's work, and Jackson clearly appreciated this as he wrings brilliant performances from Elijah Wood and Sean Astin.  Finally, the strained and warped relationship between Denethor and Faramir is nicely captured, and well framed within the context of the larger story.Finally, the coronation scene, while not entirely true to the book, is Tolkien-esque in every way.  Aragorn's simple, yet powerful tribute to the hobbits captures in everyway the ancient nobility of his line even as it speaks to Tolkien's view of the hidden greatness of the common man.Alas, as I have indicated, all of these elements, as well as a superb ensemble cast, are rather let down by critical misunderstandings of Tolkien's work and themes.  First and foremost among these is the arrival of the Army of the Dead at the Battle of Pelennor Fields.  Readers of the novels will note that they only travel with Aragorn to the mouth of the Anduin where they capture the Corsairs of Umbar.  At that time Aragorn holds their debt fulfilled and travels north with Gondorian soldiers and volunteers.  Thus he has relieved the pressure on Gondor with, but not eliminated it.  By moving the Army of the Dead to Gondor, and making them invincible, Jackson has rendered the sacrifice of the Gondorians and the Rohirrim for naught.  Theoden in particular could have just sat tight for a few more hours, menacing Sauron's flank and waiting for the ghosts.  As I have said, Theoden and Eowyn tower in this movie, but their performance at Pelennor Fields is somewhat diluted by the eventual arrival of an invincible army.That's the primary flaw on the theatrical cut, but there are many more in the extended and new scenes.  Most glaring is Aragorn's disgusting decapitation of the Mouth of Sauron which completely debases his character and is at polar opposites with the intent of the scene as written by Tolkien.  Likewise, the final scenes with Saruman are so out of character that Jackson was wise to cut them, and there is no real gain from their presence in this edition.  Finally, the drinking contest between Gimli and Legolas, in spite of offering some funny one liners, ultimately degrades both characters.  Gimli in particular, who had been effectively used as a sincere by light-hearted character is transformed into a buffoon.There are a few nice additions, most of which are in the form of extended shots of various battles.  Of particular note is the showdown between Gandalf and the Witch King, a critical scene in the book and one which Jackson has captured quite nicely.  Also, the blossoming of Faramir's relationship with Eowyn in the House of Healing is a little brief, but still a well shot piece of exposition that fleshs out the film for people unfamiliar with the book.The extras are, as with the prior two releases, superb.  The format is the same: documentary, adaptation, visual effects, etc. so I won't dwell on them at length.  However, one particular piece is worth noting, the half hour or so devoted to the training of the horses used in the film offers and interesting glimpse into an element of film-making that often goes overlooked.  Sure to be a delight for horse lovers, it is likewise fascinating for animal lovers in general.Ultimately, ""The Return of a King"" is a good movie, and nothing I said in this review should detract from that.  Given the scope of the novels, and the time constraints, Jackson produced a powerful film that was entirely deserving of the awards lavished upon it.  Nonetheless, critical changes to the work, particularly in the extended edition, somewhat diminish this film when compared to its two predecessors.  Thus, when judged by his own tremendously high standard, Jackson fell a little short, but I still look forward to the day we hear he is going to direct ""The Hobbit"".Jake Mohlman"	4.0	Good, but falls short of the first two films	2004-12-22	24	20	4

Finally, someone has done justice to J.R.R. Tolkein's epic story.  While some people will whine about the departures of the screenplay from the huge volume of the book, I must say, it was worth the wait.  Huge in it's scope, and as true as practical to following the story presented in the trilogy, I was very satisfied with the conclusion.  Screenplays which make radical changes in the story line when adapted from a book have always irritated me.  In the case of LOTR, there are some obvious points that are not included in the movie, but they do nothing to distract or change the whole.  I have never sat through a 3 hour and 30 minute long movie before where I couldn't tear myself away for a bathroom break, but the story is so awesome, continually interesting, and just plain epic that I hardly noticed the time.  The character of Gollum, if there is any justice, should win the academy award, but all the characters worked together so well that you don't need to name a ""star"".  The other thing that makes the movie so enjoyable is how the seperate storylines are so well pieced together to keep you the viewer strapped to your seat.  Someone mentioned that the ending seemed rushed, but I didn't feel this.  After such a grand finale, the story is well tied up, and again follows the spirit of the book perfectly.  I will definitely be in-line for the DVD, so that I can enjoy this last of the trilogy in my home.  Definitely 5+ stars, see it!"	5.0	Justice is Finally Done!	2003-12-18	1	1	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3GUTAC5UVKUH	Joe Carugati	"""The Return Of The King"" had high expectations from people around the world.  ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"" (2001) was a solid, touching, first installment.  ""The Two Towers"" (2002) was a bit slower moving, but had the amazing Helm's Deep battle sequence at the end.  It also introduced new characters and gave more development to the story.  ""The Return Of The King"" blows away the first two installments by far.  It tells us the story of people and creatures who come together to conquer evil.  It is touching, amazing, and so much more.At the end of ""The Two Towers"", many things had taken place.  The Ents (whom Merry and Pippin were with) had flooded Isengard and Saruman was held in his tower.  Gandalf, Theoden, Eomer, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli had just finished the battle of Helm's Deep.  And, of course, Sam and Frodo were continuing their journey on to Mordor with Gollum, who has a secret agenda.  ""The Return Of The King"" brings all these stories together and Peter Jackson does it perfectly.At the beginning of ""The Return Of The King"", there is a flashback that explains how Smeagol (Andy Serkis) received the Ring of Power and transformed into ""Gollum"" (voiced by Andy Serkis).  We then cut to Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) on their journey to Mordor.  Along the way, Gollum tries to trick Frodo into thinking that Sam wants the Ring for himself.  Frodo says that he doesn't need Sam's help anymore and goes on to find the Gollum had tricked him.  He was led into the spider Shelob's lair.  He finds Gollum and throws him down a huge hole.  He is attacked by Shelob and is later taken away by orcs.  Sam catches up to him and saves him.  Together, they go to Mount Doom, where Gollum still lurks.Gandalf (Ian McKellen) finds Pippin (Billy Boyd) and learns that Sauron thinks he has the Ring.  So Gandalf rides to Minas Tirith where the King Denethor (John Noble) resides.  His is the father to both the son he loved, Boromir, and the son he despises, Faramir (David Wenham).  Faramir and his men had been attacked at Gondor and he was the only one that came back.  Denethor thinks he is dead and decides to burn him, while thousands of trolls, orcs, and more swarm outside of Minas Tirith.Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys Davies), and King Theoden (Bernard Hill) are preparing for battle at Pelennor Fields.  Aragorn needs more of an army and goes through the Path Of The Dead and summons the Dead Army.  All of the Rohan soldiers are going to Pelennor Fields, which is right outside of Minas Tirith.  Merry (Dominic Monaghan) is with Eowyn (Miranda Otto) on a horse with the Rohan soldiers.  They all charge and the Battle of Pelennor Fields begins.All of these actions culminate with Frodo and Sam right outside Mount Doom and the rest of the Fellowship outside of the Black Gate, ready for one last chance to give Frodo time.  Frodo gets his chance, but will he finally finish off evil forever?Acting - Elijah Wood gives another great performance as Frodo, but it is his companion, Sean Astin, who really shines.  Ian McKellen is outstanding as Gandalf and so is Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn.  Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd have more screen time as the hobbits and are very enjoyable to watch.  Orlando Bloom and John Ryhs Davies play side by side as Legolas and Gimli.  They are humorous and go well together.  Mirando Otto did a fantastic job as Eowyn.  Her battle sequence with the Witch King is stunning.  The cast does perfect in every role.  Andy Serkis does it again with his eerie voice that makes Gollum so real.  The cast does perfect in every role.  Acting (10/10)Special Effects and Battle Sequences &#65533; The special effects are breathtaking.  They look so realistic that you think you are in the movie.  CGI &#65533; Gollum is amazing as always.  The giant spider, Shelob, was one of the movie&#65533;s highlights.  If Shelob didn&#65533;t look realistic, then the movie could have been ruined.  Yet, there is always hope (&#65533;only a fool&#65533;s hope.&#65533;)  Shelob was stunning at how perfect she was done.  That part of the movie gave me the creeps at how real it was.The battle sequences are outstanding.  If you thought Helm&#65533;s Deep was huge, then this is colossal compared to it.  The Battle of Pelennor Fields is exhilarating.  The Black Gate scene also makes you feel triumph and pride while watching it.The special effects and battle sequences were great and made the movie even better than it already was.  FX and Battle Sequences (10/10)So, in conclusion, the last one is the best one for this trilogy.  This is a great movie that will leave you amazed, touched, and give you that feeling.  You know what feeling.  The one that makes you want to say, &#65533;This is why we go to the movies&#65533;&#65533;"	5.0	The Best And The Last Of The Greatest Trilogy of All Time!	2004-02-21	5	5	0

In it were spellbinding images conveyed by the descriptions of Tolkien. Then I saw this film tonight. The images on film were directly in line with the thoughts that magically danced through my head upon reading the series - if not better, MUCH better.This world I witnessed tonight, it is nowhere to be found in our world. Not the mesmerizing landscapes and distant horizons of dark fire and majestic gray and green skies, not the glorious castles or the SCREAMING Nazgul that seem to be flying right over your very head as you stuff a handful of popcorn into your astonished mouth. This world can only be dreamed - the type of dream that you relish and cling to as a dying man would cling to his soul. This world caught on film, is wonderful.You looking for that child-like feeling of magically blissful mystery and intrigue - knowing something is there, FEELING and living it one more time? That feeling can be found here. Do you want to feel as if you can TASTE the mood of a series of desperate battles, the armor beating upon your shield, the site of dead warriors combating a never ending sea of Orks and trolls as the last brave army of men look on in shock and wonderment? Look no further.This is all the glorious feeling of magic and mystery that you ever could imagine, all rolled into one film. This is light years ahead of the previous two films, and those films, light years ahead of any other fantasy/epic.And Gollum, ah, Gollum. He will haunt you and burn a mental image into the confines of your memory for years to come.Upon viewing this dream, chances are you'll never want to wake from this dream, but rather, hit the snooze and go back for another round.	5.0	I have never dreamed this beautifully.	2003-12-18	4	3	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AM7JZP112FH0V	John Charet	Director Peter Jackson's final installment titled Return Of TheKing will go down in cinematic history as not only the best onein the glorious Lord Of The Rings trilogy, but it will be remem-bered by critics and audiences as one of the greatest screen epics for the ages that achieved an impossible task. DirectorPeter Jackson more than achieves the task of expertly craftingJ.R.R. Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings trilogy into an adaptable film series, he also creates one of the best screen epics of alltime. The story continues with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and SamwiseGamgee (Sean Astin) on their quest to Mordor to destroy the oneRing that when anyone hangs onto it for a long time, they end upgetting addicted to it's power. Helping them is the distrustfulGollum (Voiced by Andy Serkis, who just like in the last adventure Two Towers, creates a two dimensional CGI character).Gollum (A.K.A. Smeagol) feels betrayed by Frodo, whom he callsMaster, so he goes back to his old ways by joining forces withhis alter ego Gollum to get rid of Frodo and Samwise. Meanwhile,other members of the broken Fellowship, Aragorn (Viggo Morten-sen), elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and white wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) regroup withtwo other members of the Fellowship, the two hobbits Pippin(Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) to join forces as theyin seperate elements of the story fight in the battle at MinasTirith, which would lead up eventually to the last stand ofSauron and his orcs, who are the demonish team he is leading.Just like it's first two predecessors Fellowship Of The Ring, and The Two Towers, Return Of The King is not just a fantasy, itis an epic with a great amount of substance and a great amountof scale. Another similarity is the three hour and a half running time seems to fly by as viewers become intrigued by thethis beautiful and sweeping adventure. Unlike the last two Mat-rix films which ended with a bore, this trilogy not only endswith a bang, but director Peter Jackson, aside from deliveringthroughly exciting action sequences, which are in two wordsfantastic and phenominal, he also gives us a fascinating andengrossing human story about friendship: how friendship reunitedFrodo and Samwise to complete their journey to destroy the ring.Another element was at the beginning of the climactic battlewhen Gimli said I never thought I would die with an elf and Legolas said what about a friend and Gimli implied that he ishappy to be friends with an elf. The third one is when Pippin and Merry reunite at the end of the major battle involving thedeath of the Nasguil. They depicted that to show how to someextent the whole war they are battling in Middle Earth is reuni-ting everybody to form into one whole fellowship together and win the war that is so overwhelming to the inhabitants of MiddleEarth. Family: Faramir (David Wenham) gets betrayed by hisgreedy father Denethor (John Noble), who always thought his older brother Boramir (Sean Bean, who died in Fellowship Of TheRing) was the favorite. Another one is when Eowyn (Miranda Otto)promises to take care of her uncle Theoden (Bernard Hill) but hesays that he is dying and implies to take on his legacy. Courage: When every warrior in Middle Earth gathers together tofight the final battle.Another one of my favorite action fantasy epics. This one justlike Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Almost Famous, Band Of Bro-thers, the previous LOTR films, Master And Commander, and LostIn Translation delivers what it promises. This movie won all theeleven oscars it was nominated for, and richly or should I saymore than deserved them all. It richly and more than deserved it's best picture oscar also. Peter Jackson wows us with exper-tly choreographed and throughly awesome action sequences that rank up with the last two Lord Of The RIngs films, Saving Private Ryan, the films of Akira Kurosawa, and BRaveheart. It also contains a richly detailed plot that was sadly missing frommost action films of the 1980's and the 1990's. The cast is out-standing: Viggo Mortensen brings heroism to his role of Aragorn,Orlando Bloom makes the most of his supporting role as Legolas,John Rhys-Davies provides the comic relief as Gimli, as does Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan as Pippin and Merry. Miranda Otto shines with her poignant performance as Eowyn and best of all, she even gets to fight during a battle. ELijah Wood and Sean Astin bring a considerable amount of humanity and heroism to their roles, just like Tobey Maguire did with his Peter Par-ker role in Sam Raimi's Spider Man. Ian McKellen plays Gandolfwith enthusiasm like usual and Cate Blanchett's wonderful perf-ormance as Galadriel represents a beautiful angel from heaven.Special mention must also go to Australian actor Hugo Weaving,who is just awesome as Elrond that he even tops his second andthird best performance's, which was his performance in Proof and his awesome role as bad guy Agent Smith in The Matrix. Another one is Liv Tyler, who is just beautiful and gorgeous asElrond's daughter Arwen. Again just like Cate Blanchett's Gala-driel, she closely resembles a beautiful angel from heaven.All in all, a milestone of cinema and a tour de force from startto finish. I am a big fan of action movies and Peter Jacksonjoins up there in the ranks with legendary action directors: Akira Kurosawa, Sam Peckinpah, John Woo, James Cameron, andSteven Spielberg.Other Recommended Peter Jackson FilmsLord Of The Rings Trilogy (2001, 2002, 2003)Heavenly Creatures (1994)Dead Alive (1992)Forgotten Silver (1996)Lord Of The Rings Return Of The King Was Reviewed By:John CharetA.K.A.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2S5L8C241G679	"John Dalgio ""DestructioN"""	Return of the King is quite possibly one of the greatest movies of all time.Let me begin, by saying that I am a HUGE Tolkien fan, and have read almost all of his works on Middle Earth.  And, I know that there are some Tolkien purists who do not approve of some of the changes Peter Jackson made, but, these are the same people that complain about the length of the movie...well, if all the story/dialogues were left in the film, each part of the trilogy would be 6+ hours and probably would just be better left as a novel.  It's enjoyable reading every little thing in the Tolkien books, but, I dont think watching two people sit and talk for 3 hours straight on the silver screen would be the same enjoyment.Peter Jackson did an amazing job of capturing the spirit of the books.  With an amazing array or special effects, incredibly moving performances, and an outstanding recreation of Middle Earth, Jackson's Return of the King is the final tale of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and delivers a knockout.  Though there are some changes within the tale, what remains is the best for the big screen and brings the viewer into the Middle Earth world.The sound and picture quality of RotK are a step above almost any other movie out today.  The special features are a bit lacking, but are good for a viewer who is unfamiliar with some of the Middle Earth material.Overall, this is a movie that shouldnt be left out of anyone's collection.	5.0	Absolutely Amazing...	2004-07-24	17	15	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2TUA4VWCMNXI	John D. Cofield	I think this is a good film with the potential for being great.  Unlike most reviews I've seen I don't think it is the best of the three, Fellowship is superior in that it follows the book more closely.  As with both Fellowship and Two Towers, we will not see this film at its best until the Extended Version is released next year.There are many beautiful and stirring scenes in The Return of the King.  One of the finest depicts Arwen on her way to the Grey Havens having a vision of her possible future with as consort of Aragorn  and mother of Eldarion.  This is not only lovely but it clears up some confusion (at least for me) in The Two Towers where there is a scene of Arwen leaving Rivendell in company with other elves. I wondered last year if the third movie would show Arwen turning around at some point, so I'm doubly pleased with this scene for having proven me correct!  I also loved the opening scene with Deagol and Smeagol for showing Smeagol's gradual corruption into Gollum so clearly. The Departure for the West was very fine, but I found Frodo's reunion with the Fellowship after the War ended much more emotionally wrenching.  It reminds me of the scene at Rivendell when Frodo sees Bilbo for the first time, which always raises a lump in my throat.  Among the battle scenes the one I was most touched by was Faramir's departure from Minas Tirith, as the populace bade farewell to their doomed men. (By the way, the Gondorians were well cast for their dark hair and eyes and pale skins, very Numenorean and most unlike the more Nordic Rohirrim. The architecture was also suitably grand, somber carven stone that was obviously the work of a very proud and ancient culture.)  The Ride of the Rohirrim and the deaths of Theoden and the Witch-king were magnificent and, because they followed the book so closely, most effective. I had always interpreted the Dead who followed Aragorn as being sad, humble shades who were eager for a chance to redeem themselves, so their leader's arrogance was somewhat disturbing, but it did seem to work well in the end.I feel the film was too condensed, particularly towards the end with the use of a map to trace the triumphal journey home.  I am ambivalent about the loss of the Scouring of the Shire, because one of Tolkien's themes is that it is not possible to return to find everything as it always was.  Not having this part also lessens our awareness of Frodo's final weariness and pain which makes his journey to the West inevitable.  He looked far too healthy at the Grey Havens! I really disliked Gollum's being able to turn Frodo against Sam, even temporarily, though it did underscore the Ring's power to corrupt.  Also, the Mount Doom scenes were overdone.  Surely Tolkien's own description of the final fight, Gollum's fall, and Sam's rescue of Frodo are dramatic enough without having to add a literal cliffhanger!  As to the battle scenes,  beautifully done but almost to excess, especially with Legolas' acrobatics on the mumak and the continuation of his competition with Gimli. (Not to mention the continuing dwarf jokes!)  I also found these battles less compelling than Helm's Deep.  Perhaps it was the difference in the civilian population.  Minas Tirith's prosperous citizens seemed to be less vulnerable and less frightened than Rohan's peasants huddling in the caves, probably because their Dunedain heritage made them more dignified, even when scrambling for cover!  Denethor was the least realized character.  Tolkien's austere autocrat became a violent, almost vulgar madman.  I always saw Denethor as cold and remote, even when about to light his funeral pyre.  The movie's flaming plunge off the cliff was sheer theatrics and any dramatic effect was lost in the midst of the battle. Speaking of Denethor, I am unimpressed with his Guards, who on one hand were perfectly willing to obey his order to burn him and his son alive, while on the other they stood apathetically by when Gandalf raised his staff against their Steward! The tendency to ignore travel times and difficulties also grated at times.  We are asked to believe Elrond sped from Rivendell to Dunharrow with Anduril, then returned to Rivendell to bring Arwen to Gondor!There are some plot holes which the Extended Edition will probably resolve.  How did Saruman's palantir wind up in the water at Orthanc, or Sam get hold of the elven glass and Sting at Cirith Ungol? (Of course long time readers know how, but those who aren't familiar with the book might find this puzzling.) Faramir and Eowyn are obviously a couple at the coronation, and it would be nice to see how they met and fell in love at the Houses of Healing. At the Grey Havens we are told that the Three Rings are leaving with their bearers, but the bearers aren't identified.  (I did notice Gandalf was wearing a ring, and viewers of the Fellowship Extended Edition know Galadriel bore Nenya, but Elrond's ring is not shown, or at least I didn't spot it.)Interestingly enough, some scenes from the trailers didn't make it into the film: Merry swearing allegiance to Theoden at Edoras, Eomer weeping over Eowyn on the battlefield, or the Witchking's confrontation with Gandalf at the Gate of Minas Tirith.  These will probably be in the Extended Version too.So Peter Jackson's great trilogy is finished.  Does it compare with the books? Certainly not, but no film ever could. But I do believe it is the best that could have been created at this time and place, and it does give many people who would not otherwise experience Tolkien a taste of Middle earth.	5.0	Jackson's  Culmination	2003-12-18	2	2	0

If Jackson really wanted to get it all in, the film would probably be about 7 hours long, at least.  The beginning starts out great, and the battle scenes are spectacular, but I just get lost watching it during the last hour or so...  There are several climax points in the book, and for anyone who wanted to get this right, they really needed to spend more time with each individual character climax, instead of an overall climax.  Many partings became too many partings.  Vigo Mortensen hums a short verse to something Jackson threw together 5 minutes before production.  It really needed more time in the oven...

However, like Star Wars, Jackson had too many loose strings to tie up, and may not have allocated his time as well as he could.  The re-uniting of Arwen and Aragorn was insipid as she jumps out from behind a banner to surprise him.  How cute.  The budding romance between Aaragorn and Eowyn was never laid to rest.  Poor Gandalf was never really given a chance to ""strut his stuff"", as all he seemed to do was to gallop around Gondor and order soldiers about.  And for goodness sakes, poor Elrond is left standing in the crowd at the coronation, not exactly being accorded the level of respect an Elf Lord deserves.  Can't say Legolas did much either.  I did think the roles of Merry, Pippin, and Faramir were well developed, and that Theoden almost held the film together single-handedly. Surely the final sequence at the Gray Havens should have been dropped, although the scene of Sam returning home to his family was well done.Maybe everyone was just tired and ready to go home by the third film, including Peter Jackson?"	4.0	Not Quite As Good As the First Two	2004-01-02	11	3	8

Although I recognize your right to your opinion, your criticisms of this film echo the criticisms that Tolkien absorbed from the literary guardians of academe in his own time. Witness his professed disdain for the false intellectualism of allegory. He recognized the most important thing about creative writing: to entertain. The same holds for Peter Jackson's achievement in this film. Few authors in modern history held their audience with such rapt attention and provided them with such joy, as did Tolkien, and again, Jackson has enjoyed accomplishment at a similar level with his film. While it is easy for all of us to find niggles we might have done differently, it's hard to imagine anyone having tackled a project of this impossible enormity with any closer proximity to perfection. The achievment nearly defies comprehension. Sorry to gush, but I've seen a lot of movies over lo these many decades, and I studied film in college too, so ""I know what I'm talking about."" In terms of adaptation, casting, special effects, and most importantly a very clear and profound respect for the author and the audience... this film is nothing less than a grand slam and will set the high bar for quality entertainment for many years to come."	5.0	Tolkien, Jackson, and Academia	2005-05-03	18	16	2

Oscar really doesnt favor comedies like Lost in TRanslation over dramas. + come on it really was the best movie. It winning best picture would totally make up for the last two years. Look at the golden globes, they won all 4 awards they were nominated for. it also scored huge at the box office which means LOTS of other people like these movies too. this movie was just so cool. Some people just think its too long, but look at Titantic and Schindler's List and Dances with Wolves. Sometimes u just need to make a movie long to make it good. Some people don't like it b/c its fantasy, don't go see it if u dont like elves and orcs.this is most obviously gonna win best picture and a lot of other things. also.... this is the only trilogy that all three movies were nominated for best picture at the oscars.	5.0	will definately win BEST PICTURE mark my words!!!!	2004-02-17	4	3	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3A48XEYWLWH7T	John IV	Wednesday, January 05, 2005 / 5 of 5 / Simply stunning.While it was somewhat painful to wait for the Platinum edition of Return of the King, it was certainly worth it.  With an additional hour of material it further fleshes out the material and for the most part enhances the theatrical release. The culmination of the Ring saga is stunning in its scope; I can honestly say that this is the best 11+ hour film I have seen.  Everything about it works wonderfully, the cast and the story, the scoring, sound, effects, all combine for a lasting effect.  The extras on the DVDs round out the story with the frenzied race to the finish and the eventual Oscar sweep.  I originally felt that the final assault on Minis Tiris paled a bit compared to the raw savagery of the Helms Deep battle, but watching it repeatedly on DVD, it has won me over, there is so much to see, additional viewings are required.  I'm constantly amazed at how much richer the tableau, acting, effects mixture, music, and sound is in this trilogy vs Star Wars.  It's been quite an amazing journey and new accolades escape me, suffice to say it will likely be a while before something as epic as the Rings movies comes along again.  Highly recommended.	5.0	Simply stunning.	2005-01-05	3	3	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	"With this special extended edition of ""Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King"", viewers have a film nearly four hours and ten minutes long which neatly ties in some of the elements missing in the theatrical release, even if Jackson's adaptation remains true only to Tolkien's spirit, not his published prose. Here we finally see what happens to Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) in a brief, brilliantly acted scene that sets the stage for what follows. The extended version also explains the romance between Eowyn (Miranda Otto)  and Faramir (David Wenham), even if it doesn't quite emphasize Aragorn's (Viggo Mortenson) importance in healing both figures within the Houses of Healing. This new edition also includes new scenes of Aragorn leading the Army of the Dead, Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) fateful confrontation with the Witch King of Angmar at Minas Tirith, and Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Austin) dressed as Orc soldiers rushing towards Gondor. There is also a fascinating scene near the end of the film, introducing the Voice of Saruman, as the battle-weary veterans of the Pelennor Fields confront Sauron's army at the Black Gate of Mordor. And then there's a new scene showing Aragorn's mastery of the Denethor's (John Noble) palantir, which hints strongly at the reason behind the Steward of Gondor's descent into madness.The ensemble acting remains terrific, though several members of the cast deserve highest praise. Sean Astin's performance of Samwise Gamgee will be long remembered as among the most riveting, emotionally powerful performances in a film of this kind, adding considerable depth to a courageous figure already evident in the second Lord of the Rings film. Elijah Wood's Frodo is yet another riveting performance, showing both the good and bad aspects of this hobbit's nature. Bernard Hill's King Theoden is a noble man at peace with himself, recognizing his imminent doom outside of the gates of Minas Tirith. Miranda Otto's Eowyn is the finest performance from the female members of the cast, emphasizing both the tranquil and martial aspects of the Rohan princess' nature. And Andy Serkis's Gollum/Smeagol is perhaps the most fascinating portrayal of a twisted, emotionally unstable figure I have seen on film.Howard Shore's latest, brilliant score is a splendid musical companion to the events unfolding on screen, replete with exceptional solo performances from flutist James Galway and opera singer Renee Fleming. It is a magnificient score of Wagnerian and Mahlerian proportions deserving of frequent performances in concert halls worldwide. He also composed the music for Annie Lennox's ""Into the West"", which is heard during the film's closing credits.The extended DVD version contains two DVDs of interviews with the production staff and cast, as well as further immersion into the lands of the Middle-Earth. It's as well done as the extended DVDs for the other films in Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and is surely worth acquiring for both fans of these films and the books themselves, as well as fans of great films. To his credit, Peter Jackson has made yet another cinematic triumph, which will be remembered as among the finest adaptations of literature into film; indeed his entire ""Lord of the Rings"" saga should be regarded as the finest fantasy film series ever made, and one which will be remembered for a long time by serious students of cinema as well as of Tolkien's work. I was eagerly awaiting the release of this special extended edition; it will be a delightful Christmas present for many."	5.0	Wonderful Extended Version of LOTR - TRK	2004-12-26	3	3	0

Merry (Billy Boyd) and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan) both help out with our other heroes to battle against Sauron's minions in the ultimate battle between good and evil, can Aragon become King as he was destined and will there be hope that Frodo successfully destroys the ring or will it take hold of him?An awesome finale to the groundbreaking Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson and company hands down were faithful to Tolkein's book in every way. Co-starring Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, Cate Blancett, Karl Urban and John Nobel this is a smashing epic 3 hour finale of the trilogy. Ranking up there with 3 hour epics like ""Gone with the wind"", ""Doctor Zhavigo"", ""Ben-Hur"", ""Titanic"" or whatever showing what true cinematic genius this third installment of a major trilogy can stand up to the first two much like ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"", ""Return of the Jedi"", ""Toy Story 3"" or whatever third installment. Flawless acting, amazing visual effects by WETA, solid storytelling, multiple endings, emotion, a rousing score by Howard Shore and bloody epic action sequences galore made this a true movie that earned it's cinematic history like the last 2 movies and deservedly earned it's oscar for best picture and 13 awards.This Blu-Ray has brilliant picture and terrific sound quality that can't be matched while the DVD has special features like trailers, Extended DVD preview, Lord of the Rings Aragon's Quest game preview, TV Spots, 3 documentaries and featurette gallery."	5.0	A satisfying finale to the ultimate Fantasy trilogy since the Star Wars trilogy!	2011-07-05	1	1	0

I think the films are a bit overrated, but the DVDs are wonderful.But the way they are marketing them is not. If Jackson really cared about less than money, would he release the ""Special"" Editions, only to have previews for the ""Platinum Extended"" versions on the Special Editions?!It's like saying, ""Thanks for buying this movie, and here's a preview of the real good edition that you were too stupid to wait around for.""I knew about the extended editions ahead of time so I waited.

And if I had to use another word, it would be RACIST. So YUCK, RACISM! is that I am saying about this film.Why racist? One thing I noticed right away with is that evil equals BLACK and good equals WHITE. There are basically no bad white guys or good black guys. Gandalf is white (literally The White!), Gondor is the White City, hobbits are all white, all the elves are white as anything, and so on.What this movie seems to be about is defending white people against black people. Because it is a fantasy, all the black folks are ugly and, like African cannibals, try to eat each other when they get pissed. This happens in every movie. ""MEat's back on the menu!""I also wish the film was slightly longer. We don't know what happened to the Ents from the second movie, nor why Gollum bites the ring off Frodo's hand. Why didn't he just put it on and escape? It makes no sense!Another thing that confuses me is the whole business with Arwen. Isn't she a warrior? Why isn't she fighting with her fiance (Aragon)?Let me first remind you by saying that I'm a big fan of Tolkien. My favourite books right now are probably the Narnia books the he co-wrote with C.S. Lewis. So I was surprised that God seems to be missing! Where is God in all this? The Gospel says that ""If ye preach out into the world, carry not a sword but a hammer, not a shield but the word of God."" Tolkien was a great Christian from what I have read, but at the end of the day God isn't home! We know where Satan is (his tower) but Our Lord just lets people down, which is SO inaccurate.Anyway, I can't recommend you see this film -- that's why I gave it the low ratings. Yes, it is well-made but the dual anti-Christian and racist messages make it unacceptable."	3.0	YUCK, RACISM! (sorry)	2004-01-08	93	6	87

There are new insights into the movie with every viewing..............My greatest hope with the Platinum Edition which I ordered this evening is that it will tell the story of Gandolf and the Kingdom of the Eagles. Remember that Gandolf was rescued from Sauron's Tower of Isengard by the eagle and the eagles did not return until they attacked the Ring Wraiths at the end of the Return of the King and then saved Frodo and Samwise from their perch above the flowing lava of Mount Doom where they had no hope of being saved without their assistance.

Orcutt ""Elessar"""	This is most certainly a fantastic conclusion to the first two great films.  The extended edition is yet to be released in December, however I think it is certain that it will continue the tradition Jackson has set for the EE's as a tribute to the overall Tolkien fan, the readers who have indulged beyond just Lord of the Rings into the entire world of Middle Earth.I'm one of the Tolkien addicts who always wanted more, more more when it comes to how much of the extraneous storyline was included by Jackson in the films...It has been rumored the EE release will NOT include Scouring of the Shire scenes or many substantial end-scenes of Saruman's demise/Grima's revenge...Which really sucks to me, but I can understand the necessity to keep RotK under 6 hours...And I'm happy with all the bonus details that get included in the EE, but I'm the type who'd just as well have LOTR turned into a total story-telling of The History of Middle Earth.I want to tell those who have only seen the films - look beyond and explore the rest of the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien, for LOTR is a magnificient epic - however the Silmarillion and the rest of his writings complete the story in a way that can only be fully realized outside the boundaries of this film.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A33CLVW2K7SL1P	Jonathan Appleseed	"Virtually all of the extended and new scenes added depth, meaning, and fluidity to the film, which the theatrical release lacked. I saw the theatrical release with a person who had never read the books, and much confused him. For example, what happened to Saruman? Where did he go? When asked, ""What of the White Wizard,"" why did the Witch King of Angmar reply, ""I will break him,"" only to have nothing come of it. For myself, I wondered why the scene with the Mouth of Sauron had been deleted, and very much wanted to see it.The two questions my friends posed were answered. There's so much to comment on here that it would be impossible to touch on everything with any depth, so I'm going to pick the three additional scenes noted above and focus on them.First, some comments on the film itself. As with the previous two movies, I was disappointed with the theatrical release, mainly because of the removal of the scenes I will discuss later, but also because the film lacked a coherent fluidity. Even so, I was left breathless at the accomplishments of Jackson and his team. The special effects were and are the finest I've ever seen. Just as I felt that I was deep within a mountain while the Fellowship was in the Mines of Moria, so also I felt that I was immersed within a battle to save Minas Tirith. The construction of that city, and its destruction, was beautifully done. The confrontation with the dead was appropriately eerie, and the effects surrounding that scene tremendous. There isn't enough to say about the ingenious special effects, nor the manner in which the battle scenes played out, and how all of the characters interacted with each other.But the story lacked. Saruman cannot simply disappear without explanation, especially when he is such a central character to the story. I believe that the exclusion of ""The Voice of Saruman"" from the theatrical release was Jackson's second biggest mistake (I'll get to the biggest in a moment). The scene itself was curiously crafted. Saruman spoke to them from the top of the five hundred foot tower of Orthanc, and it's difficult to believe that conversations without multiple utterances of ""what?"" could have occurred. In the book, Saruman and Grima were much lower. That is, though, a minor point, and we can allow for the suspension of disbelief.There was one surprise in the scene: Saruman, angered by Gandalf's softly spoken urges to join with them, sent a blast of fire from his staff that engulfed Gandalf in flames, and when the flames die out Gandalf still sat astride Shadowfax, and he and his steed are untouched. Saruman, for the first time in the film, shows a decided lack of confidence, if not panic. That did not happen in the book, and as somewhat of a purist, I was taken aback. Then I realized that it was an appropriate representation of Gandalf's ascension, his apotheosis. Then Gandalf spoke the words I had been longing to hear since the theatrical release of The Two Towers: ""Saruman, your staff is broken"". It's breaking was such a welcome sight. That Saruman then slaps down Grima in an expression of almost helpless rage, and Grima in turn chooses that moment to stab Saruman in the back, sending him plunging to his death in a most horrific fashion, was appropriate, as The Scouring of the Shire was not going to be part of the film. This was a most satisfying scene.Far less satisfying was ""The Witch Kings Hour"". Something obscene and profane happened within this scene; something impossible within the context of the universe that Tolkien created. I can imagine him revolving in his grave like a turbine. When the Witch King swooped down into Minas Tirith to confront Gandalf, I expected something similar to the scene described above. I expected a physical confrontation, although it did not exist in the book, and for the Witch King to be harmed, to an extent. Instead, the Witch King broke Gandalf's staff and Gandalf was thrown from his horse. Jackson, as a rabid fan of Tolkien's work, and surrounded by others who were also rabid fans, should have known better.Laugh if you will, but I almost shut the movie off at that point, so great was my  frustration. It's one thing to alter events to try and broaden the appeal of a movie (e.g., the inclusion of Arwen), one thing again to include things that didn't happen in the book to offer some form of structural symbolism (e.g., Gandalf being engulfed in flame), but it's another thing entirely to have something happen that could not *possibly* have happened. The Witch King of Angmar was no feeble opponent, to be certain, but he was only a man. Gandalf was not only of the race of the Maiar (within Tolkien's mythos, I analogize the Maiar to angels), he had also been reborn, sent back to Middle Earth cleansed and ""greater"". No man, regardless of his form, regardless of any ring he may wear, regardless of the power that runs within him, *could have possibly broken Gandalf's staff*. It disgusted me, as it should every fan of The Lord of the Rings. It was impossible, and entirely unforgivable.More satisfying was ""The Mouth of Sauron"". Aragorn, Gandalf and others approached the Black Gates and demanded that Sauron come forth. Instead, Sauron sent his Lieutenant, who sought to chide the group with insults from a mouth in dire need of a dentist with a good saw and grinder, and with Frodo's garments. Although it didn't happen in the book, Aragorn tired of his babbling and chopped off his head. Jolly good fun that was.Regardless of my disgust with the ""The Witch King of Angmar"", this still stands as one of the most remarkable accomplishments in cinematic history, and the result for this fan of Tolkien's work was immense satisfaction. Kudos, Mr. Jackson."	5.0	Extended version makes the saga complete	2004-12-15	12	8	4

Reinhart ""The Raven Strikes Again"""	"I just got back from seeing RoTK today. I went with two friends (they say it last night at a sneak peek but this was my first viewing of it). The film is a major epic and highly memorable but it suffers from some major flaws. It glosses over the conclusion of Battle of Isengard, doesn't bother to explain the Palantir, contains some dry/poor acting and lines (mainly poor jokes revolving around Gimli and Legolas that do not get pulled off well), and the ending is highly inappropriate and disappointing in conjunction with the film.The ending is great but not at the end of THIS film. The film contains one of the best battle scenes I've ever seen, akin to that from [i]Spartacus[/i], bringing viewers to an emotional high with adrenaline pumping but then goes into a ""where are they now?"" series of subdued scenes mainly with an orchestral (albeit incredible orchestral) piece serving as the main auditory feature excepting the last scenes in which some dialogue is jutted forth. Jackson attempted to utilize some of the novel's closure but it turned out to be poorly done/placed in this film.On a more positive note, the film flowed incredibly well and had some of the best special effects I've seen recently in a film that has an overall solid performance (I'm thinking a 6 out of 10). I'd definately see it again in the hopes that it grows on me."	3.0	Overall solid performance	2004-12-27	3	1	2

To see the entire four hours plus that this portion of the LOTR extended series supplies is time well spent.Again, this is not just another great movie. It is visually stunning and well crafted, but it is also a thinking person's movie.Upon looking at the extended version, one might come to view the story in more highly metaphoric terms, especially in a day and age where the attainment of a goal is often difficult and the guidelines for achievement are increasingly called into question. In other words, one might come to ask, ""In order to arrive to the solution, is there a 'My Precious!' in my life that I must give up, even if it is beautiful, and if so, what or where is the path to my Mordor that must be undertaken? And who would be the Sauron in this case?""Those questions could possibly have been asked after watching Fellowship and Two Towers, but Return of the King sheds a whole new light on the subject matter.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A5H8VLE7L7SB	Jose	"Peter Jackson has definitely achieved more than a classic or a cult for fans. This film is perhaps one of the most precious jewels in the history of cinema.All of the performances delivered, the special effects were dazzling and used when and exactly how it was necessary for keeping the film as more than a mere visual show. A true and powerful drama and fantasy adventure.The Battle of Pelennor Fields is something Hollywood is going to try (and notice I said TRY) to reproduce for years. And I doubt there can be many faithful adaptations to the spirit of a mythology like this one.On the other hand, the only thing that bothers me about this DVD is the lack of ""Extended Edition Preview"" unlike previous Lord of the Rings Theatrical Editions (the announcement with the features in the official page omitted this one). I know I certainly will prefer the Extended Edition (like the first two films) better, and personally recommend these editions over the Theatrical ones.If you cannot wait until November (or June as some rumors claim over there), or if you are not that of a Lord of the Rings fan and prefer the rough cut that is a Theatrical version compared to the Extended one, then buy this one.But I still advice people to wait for the Extended Edition which will include scenes like Saurman's fate after a final confrontation with Gandalf, The Houses of Healing where Eowyn's love for Aragorn comes to closure after meeting Faramir, more Pelennor Fields, more Minas Morgul with Sam and Frodo, probably the Mouth of Sauron character, Aragorn confronting Sauron through the Palantir, more of the ""Path of the Death"" with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, Gandalf's confrontation woth the Witch-King, and much more ( - over 40 minutes of additional material! - )"	5.0	A Jewel of Film History	2004-03-15	32	27	5

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2DSXA1E02C86D	Joseph Haschka	Having now seen the entire LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, I'm comfortable saying that the series, as a visual epic, is perhaps the best ever put on celluloid. But praise the Lord, it's over. And I can barely remember what the plot was all about when it started two years ago.I haven't read, nor do intend to read, the original novels; I don't plan to ever again watch any of the screen adaptations. Life is too short.Some observations about THE RETURN OF THE KING can perhaps be applied to all three films. The battle sequences are phenomenal with a capital &quot;P&quot;. Without them, tedium is a definite risk. Cate Blanchett's all too brief appearances are a terrible waste of her incredible acting talent. Frodo desperately needs a Hobbit Babe to show him a Good Time. There are too many characters and subplots. Oddly, the are no acting performances, in my opinion, worth an Oscar nomination. It's all visual, visual, visual, and visual again.The beginning sequence of THE RETURN OF THE KING, in which the viewer learns why Smeagol is what he is, was inspired. Smeagol was, for me, the most interesting character in the entire series. Who does his hair, do you think?That was the best monster spider I've ever seen. I bought the extra-large size can of Raid on the way home.The conclusion was 20 minutes too much, especially on a school night. I kept glancing at my watch, and would have staggered out had my wife not been with me. The ending credits could have rolled after Frodo and Sam were rescued by the eagles. As a matter of fact, a full hour could have been chopped off the run time with any lackadaisical editing effort whatsoever.Finally ...A lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth would have been prevented had somebody just tossed that stupid ring down a sewer grate.	5.0	The End, thank heaven!	2003-12-24	22	5	17
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1TKM36EYEQNSM	Joseph J. Slevin	I was impressed with the first two Movies especially the first and the second.  However, this one shifted between scenes with the development with the Kings return and final battle for middle earth and Frodo's problems with getting the ring to its final resting place.This movie was also a lot 'darker' than the previous two.The battle scene for this movie was extreme, a little too contrived, yet with 'magic' what do you expect.  I was very surprised how this image seemed a little like Star Wars in reverse.  The groups fighting each other good versus evil were somewhat switched.  For instance, all of the people on the good side were basically white (did anyone see people of color in this movie?)Also, the creatures and humans combined to attack the city for it's final demise seemed like those fighting with the Jedi, mostly strange looking creatures.  Of course that is only a thought. Gandalf seemed a lot like Obiwan and Frodo fighting the evil of the ring seemed a little like Luke fighting the evil side of the force.For those who read the Bible, you may get a hint of some 'Biblical themes.'  For instance the whole world gathers together to fight at the return of the king for the final battle of good and evil.  Sounds a little like the book of Revelation.  As well there is an army of dead souls for lack of a better name who come in and win the day as the city is attacked.  In Revelation, the King of kings, returns with 10s of thousands of angels to fight the final battle.Interesting that Tolkien was a friend and contemporary of CS Lewis. His themes were a story to empasize good against evil and the overall struggle that leads to goods triumph.Yet, this trilogy was especially great in the first two episodes.More on those later.	4.0	Very Strong Ending to a Great Concept Movie	2004-07-14	2	0	2

As happened before, essential exposition and character development were left on the cutting room floor, much reducing the depth of the movie, leaving annoying lose ends and speeding its pace to action-movie level. That was the reason the end scenes that seemed so long in the cinema now look just about right. What was worth 11 Oscars is now bigger and improved: once you see it you will not want to go back to the truncated version. I was lucky enough to see the Extended Editions of the first two films on a movie theatre also (they ran here before Return of the King opened), I just hope I get to see this one too.	5.0	The Trilogy Completed	2004-12-30	4	3	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2MLTFPL4JLQMU	JR Morris	This is a great movie based on the books.  This is the final one so far.  You would get much more out of it if you saw the first two.  Because of this being the 3rd installment, a big time commitment is required to watch all of these.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1LVZOK9F7K4CN	JR Pinto	This is the first Lord of the Rings movie that I have seen without reading the book.  Perhaps that has colored my perceptions, but I believe this to be the best of the three.  It comes on strong and doesn't let up for most of the movie.  There is one spectacular battle scene after another.There are plenty of small touches I like as well.  I enjoyed the prologue which gives us a more detailed account of Gollum's back-story.  I LOVED the giant spider that Frodo faces.  I also like the way the movie takes the time to show us what happens to our heroes afterwards.  It asks the question; Just what does one do with oneself once the adventure is over?I would have liked to have seen Christopher Lee in it, but I guess I'll have to wait for the DVD.	5.0	The best of the three...	2003-12-21	3	3	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2NBOL825B93OM	J R Zullo	"Once more, Peter Jackson, his cast and special effects crew don't disappoint the viewer / Tolkien fan. From the beginning of the series, it seems Jackson was able to enter Tolkien's mind and bring to the big screen the beautiful and colorful Middle-Earth and its different characters.And now, the trilogy is completed. In the end, with what are we, Ring fans, left with? This third movie seems to me the apotheosis of all epic movies. Excellent acting, brilliant direction, characters we all want to be acquainted with, special effects that left me with a hanging jaw (the scene in Aragog's cave was one of the most impressive I've ever seen, the Minas Tirith battle, the oliphants, and many, many more).After watching the final scene in ""The return of the king"", what I find most striking is the commitment Jackson (and crew)  and his actors showed from the beginning of the project. I mean, ""Lord of the rings"" is an epic with a huge scale, and has legions of (demanding) fans all over the world. This could be a total flop. Thank God it's not. In the end, after two years of shootings, editings and such (and two years of waiting for us, viewers) the movie trilogy of Lord of the Rings is something that will never be forgotten. Of course it's different, in some parts and aspects, from the books, but to transform a written story into a visual one is never an easy task. This Jackson did. With a touch of genious.Fantastic entertainment, this is the best part of the trilogy; those three hours passed in a flash.Grade 9.5/10"	5.0	Gran finale	2004-04-30	8	7	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A28O0R1HB9MJVF	J. Savage	Quite simply the three LOTR films are the finest films ever made.Thats a bold statement to make,and before I saw the first one I was lukewarm on the whole Tolkien concept...just buy the three extended versions and you`ll see why a cynic such as myself was swept away by the sheer quality and attention to detail of the movies.From Tolkein`s horrific experiences with the Lancashire Fusiliers in the trenches of the first world war to the growing threat of fascism in the 1930s to the  brink of the unthinkable ( ie a Nazi Germany in control of most of the civilized world )it is all in these films through the loss of innocence and the absolute neccesity of going to war.From the Hobbits,who represent innocence,to the Kingdom of Gondor,that represents a war-weary nation such as Britain in the between war years,Tolkein has written a story that mirrors the European experience ( and that of the United States )in the darkest days of the 20th Century.I exhort you to buy these films.They are the finest...and amongst the most relevant...ever made.As a postscript I advise the extended versions as there is so much quality stuff that did not make it onto the originals you have to see.	5.0	THE BEST FILM SERIES EVER MADE...	2004-12-08	3	1	2

Gollum's history as introduction was exciting and very dramatical. The Figth by Minas Tirith was wonderful (sincerely I was expecting more violence, we'll see it in extended edition?). Only the kiss between Aragorn and Arwen was too poor, like a soap opera, within magical or elf environment.At the end of this movie, I was crying: 1) Because this was the last movie of the trilogy, and 2) Anne Lennox's very emotional interpretation: ""Into The West"".

You may find that the product is quite expensive but the question you must ask is it worth it? In case you want to buy the LOTR saga and never bought the previous ones I suggest you start your collection with the Extended Versions only, since this would save you the money in buying the theatrical release. Why do I feel that the Extended version is the better one? For one thing is the Deleted scenes incorporated to the movie even though it would extend the time alloted it is still worth watching it. Perhaps someday you may decide to buy it for your library collection but most of all something to cherish as a true work of art.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A15OXF84G8JKKB	Justin Bost	"What can I say about this film that has not already been said in the 300+ reviews so far?  I don't know, but I'll give it a shot:First, I must say that while I am no Tolkien purist, I have read the Hobbit trilogy several times as a child, and as others here have commented, had my own view of this world in my mind.  Certainly, however, I never could have dreamed that a once relatively obscure horror director such as Peter Jackson (e.g., Dead Alive) could do such an about face and create such a masterpiece outside his former genre.  Here are the key elements that make this film work, as with the previous two.What is drama?  This has been argued about since the times of the ancient Greeks.  Without getting bogged down in philosophical discussion here, let's see what makes this film so ""dramatic"".  My vision of a great drama is one that, while not so much celebrating humanity, embraces the human spirit.  In Middle Earth, man is only one of several races to coexist (or not, as the case may be).  Yet, each race, while exhibiting its own quirks and nuances, all seem too human upon exposure to the ancient evil of the One Ring.  Jackson manages to touch on the latent evil desires that stir within the hearts of men, elves, dwarves, and orcs alike, something we view as essentially a human trait.Yet, man is not the centerpiece of this tale, but a hobbit named Frodo, who as we see bears scars, emotional and physical, from the enormous burden of being the Ringbearer.  Samwise Gamgee is appointed the task of watching out for Frodo, and he does an admirable job.  The agony, anguish, and despair that Sam suffers, most notably in Return of the King, really hit home for me.  Having a grandfather who has Alzheimer's disease, it brings back memories of the powerlessness I have felt (and still feel) watching his descent into a dark place, and not being able to help him.  Sam battles not only these feelings, but also his own urges to claim the Ring from Frodo, as we see in Mordor.  I also appreciated the inclusion of Merry and Pippin in this film.  Their separation before the great battle at Minas Tirith is an emotional one, to say the least.  Their subsequent reunion on the battlefield is very touching indeed.Aragorn shines brightly in this film.  He is the last beacon of hope as the darkness from Mordor engulfs Middle Earth.  We got a taste of his leadership ability in his final charge on the enemy at Helm's Deep.  Without spoiling the film for those who have not watched it, I will just say that his leadership of the riders of Rohan, both at Minas Tirith and the plains of Golgoroth (at the Black Gate of Mordor) is awe-inspiring. Such a brave, charismatic, loyal leader is reminiscient of King Arthur and his Round Table, stories that have fascinated me since childhood.I thought that Gandalf's role in Return of the King was much more developed than in the first two films.  While not the centerpiece of attention, he does provide much needed leadership at Mina Tirith that the spineless Steward of Gondor does not provide.  He is a character to watch in the film.The Ringwraiths make a terrifying comeback in this final installment.  Returning to their chilling characterization of The Fellowship of the Ring, these specters of Mordor strike fear in the hearts of the bravest soldiers.  An interesting showdown with the Witch King of the Nas Ghoul (spelling?) takes place on the battlefield at Minas Tirith.  I think that audiences will be very suprised at the outcome.  One thing I really appreciated about the film was Jackson's use of the ""bird's eye view"", pardon the pun.  This made the story that much more sweeping and compelling.  I was on the edge of my seat the entire time during the siege.Finally, Jackson of course gets kudos for the setting of the film (New Zealand).  Its naturally stunning landscape doesn't exactly hurt the film.  After seeing only bits and pieces of Mordor in the first two films, the domain of the dark lord Sauron is revealed to us in its own hideous glory.  If there's a hell, I hope it doesn't resemble Mordor.  Mount Doom lives up to its billing from The Fellowship of the Ring.I puposely leave out Gollum, as well as a few other key characters, in the interest of avoiding spoilers.  Suffice it to say that Gollum, as Gandalf predicted, will play a key role in the events in the final film.  Also, pay close attention to the first ten minutes of the movie.My only request to Peter Jackson: please don't make us wait until November 2004 for the DVD!Rating: Ten stars!"	5.0	An engrossing epic that will take your breath away!	2003-12-26	7	5	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ALLJT7S5QOFFZ	kaduzy	I think these movies are amazing and nothing will change that.  There are very few films that I like well enough to listen to director's commentary, and on a 4 HOUR PLUS movie, one could particularly think that it would be a waste of time.  However, Jackson, Boyens and Walsh manage to provide a briksly paced commentary filled with actual information instead of the usual long silences and pointless narrating at which so many directors excel.The commentary is also very revealing.  Repeatedly, Jackson and co. mention certain scenes that were cut AND NOT INCLUDED IN THE DVD -- including a scene between Treebeard and Legolas that would have been great to see, since Treebeard is my favorite character from both the books and the movies, and Orlando Bloom is hot.  They make CONTINUOUS references to things that were NOT included -- and worst of all, they keep saying that these things were DELIBERATELY left out, to be included on the 25th Anniversary edition of the movie.***********WHAT????????***********This really pisses me off.  I mean, I'm a die-hard.  I own all the extended DVDs AND all the theatrical releases because I wanted every version of every film and every extra there is.  All together that adds up to $200 spent on this trilogy, lining Jackson's pockets.  And now he's baiting us with the fact that he plans to line those pockets even more in 25 years.  I've never heard of anything so greedy and manipulative, and it kills me to think that I spent all that money and STILL don't have everything.I thought this project was about art and grandeur and wonder, but I was wrong -- it, like everything, is just about money.  Well I'm not buying in 25 years, so they aren't getting any more of mine.  I'm sorry that some of the magic of these movies was spoiled for me by this unwelcome news, but I still can't bring myself to remove more than one star because let's face it: no matter what the motivations for them was, these are great movies.	4.0	WARNING: This is NOT the complete package!	2005-12-09	10	6	4

AKA the undead army.This is what happens when I get lost in the hype.  I had thought this final movie in the trilogy will not only justifiably end the series, but end it in a way to put shame into any other movie who dare end theirs and put a tear in my eyes and change my life and shed my unwanted weight and pay for my car insurance...but it didn't.Sad really, since it's not the failing of the movie but the unattainble expectation of some of its viewers (like me).  I just can't help but get stuck on all the bad parts of the movie.  Sure, the tears in my eyes welled up and dribbled down my cheek onto my jacket in various parts of the movie.  If I also thought rationally, I can also see a masterfully created finale.  But whenever I start to think back on the film and begin to like the film, I then remember the light house of sauron.I have read online (especially onering.net) and am looking forward to the extended cut of the film with many extra footages (Saruman, House of Healing, Sam and Frodo getting mixed in with the orc army in Mordor, ect.).  One rumor puts the extra footage time at over an hour (here I go getting hyped up), and that certainly will fill in some of the lesser part of the movie.Anyhow...I enjoyed the film.  4 stars, no matter how negatie this review reads like.	4.0	just a wee bit disappointed.	2004-03-13	19	4	15

Why? Because we all know these films are long, sometimes painfully so, and this edition adds a good 30 minutes to that already seriously intense running time!The added footage doesn't inhibit the story, but it doesn't really add a great deal either. It helps to explain small things in the story, but really what it helps to explain are not really any prodding story line questions. More along the lines of, 'oh hey, where did they get that cool bread?'! Now you'll know. Really trivial stuff, but kinda fun if again, you're a hardcore fan.The extra features are interesting, but after a seemingly endless movie, nobody in our family has even found the will to watch much of it sadly!The packaging is great and the slipcover sleeve houses a foldout tray that holds three separate dvds. One disc for special features, the other two discs are the feature film. And yep, that was right, the movie won't fit on one single disc. So, you have to stop halfway through and change the disc to continue the film. Thats kind of a drag, but if you're dying for those extra scenes then you just have to deal!Overall the very beautiful packaging really goes a long way to make up for anything negative about this edition. The discs are held by clear plastic bevels and under the bevels is a gorgeous map of middle earth that spans the three discs. Really lovely. It's an impressive fold out and sure to please any die hard fan of the films and or books!	5.0	It's amazing, we all know that already.	2013-02-22	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2BB4SUDG1QGFL	"Kari L. Black ""neurophoenix"""	There has been much criticism about &quot;gratuitous&quot; use of CGI in the trilogy, apparently without understanding that its use created creatures and locations that simply don't exist in the real world. Smeagol/Gollum is the best rendered animated character in movie history; but it wouldn't matter if Antony Sirkis didn't give the animated image its physicality and personality. Smeagol/Gollum works, because Sirkis gives a brilliant performance expressing the character's fractured personality. There is no way the animators, or Peter Jackson,  should be slammed for creating something never seen before in movies. Another brilliant use of CGI comes just after Faramir and his men try in vain to outrun the Nazgul: After Gandalf chases the Nazgul away the camera turns with a jerky motion to follow Gandalf on horseback, as if the cameraman was also on horseback, and we see Minas Tirith in the distance, across the plain. What impresses me is that the realism in the camera momement gives the impression that Minas Tirith is really in the distance, when in actual fact it has been created by special effects artists. The shot made me feel as if I was there on the plain with the other riders feeling the urgency of the situation. This was a CGI enhanced shot that was brilliantly conceived and executed to convey realism.However, none of the CGI elements would be worth a pixel if the actors didn't give humane, believable performances. For example, the Faramir-Denethor subplot, and the animosity between Sam and Gollum are wonderfully acted, and reveal the emotional core of the movie, which for me is love expressed as loyalty. Each of the performers does an excellent job of conveying the emotional centre of the character they play; and each character expresses their commitment to the concept of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; through their emotional connection to other particular characters. The CGI does not drown the emotional core of the movie, because the characters are so skillfully and emotionally  portrayed. The entire trilogy is technically dazzling; but the story is driven by a wonderful ensemble acting performance.	5.0	Excellent Ensemble Cast	2004-06-10	0	0	0

It is spectacular money making and unbelievably confident movie advertisement.What it ceartainly isnt however, is great cinematic achievement in terms of artistic vision.The Directors clumsily dumps some characters, nullifying the entire build up buzz that sorrounded their supposed depth andvision. What ever happened to Faramir and his Father son issues? Did they just burn away? What happened to all the heap made around Eowyn and her love to Arragon? What happenedto their attempts at making Gollum a believable character?All forgotten in a few silly suspense sequenzes?Full box offices is what happened, making useless any attempt to add a little bit more sincerity and warmth to the story.The overconfidence of rich and overfed Producers put a stopto a movie that we might have otherwise remembered and cherished a little bit more. Other then the afore mentioned reasons it is spectacular. Sadly just spectacular."	3.0	Money Mammoth movie	2004-01-31	12	0	12
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1H2LY4N0M0C0R	Karl J. Wolf	"The Lord of the Rings, probably the greatest movie in 40 years, original work of JRR Tolkien, movie version by Peter Jackson, is completed in this final movie. The Elven civilization stands on the brink of destruction. While immortal beings they suffer from the ""world weariness"" and the only thing sustaining them and their works are the Three Rings of Power. But the Three are bound up with the power of the One. If Sauron gets his Ring back, then the Three will become corrupted and the last defenses will fall. But if they succeed, and the One Ring destroyed, the Three will die too. The Elves are doomed either way, but they fight on. Their only real hope is to evacuate back to Heaven in the True West.While the Elves hold Sauron back on the magic/psychic plane, it falls on the last cultural offspring of Elven-teaching, the human empire of Gondor, to hold Mordor and the hordes of the east back militarily. The Gondorian Empire, once the most powerful force on Earth has decayed over the millennia to a kind of proud, venerable, but increasingly impotent Byzantium. If Gondor falls, so falls the World.But Sauron has already beaten the forces of good all the way back to the heartland and the ancient capital, Minas Tirith the White City! There, the High Kings of old ruled. But the old royal line passed away a thousand years ago and Gondor has since been under the control of the Ruling Stewards, who are none too keen on giving up the throne for the ""last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship."" That means Aragorn, last survivor of the old royal bloodline of Numenor, and heir to the crown.Since the Elves are doomed to depart the world whether the war is won or lost it is vital that Minas Tirith survive and hold back the tide, not only for the sake of the Free Peoples of the world and because it is the last bastion of law and order, of art, skill and technology, but more importantly Gondor will be the last civilization to be taught the ""true"" religion, the perception of the Blessed Realm in the Uttermost West. In fact the White Tree of Gondor is a sapling of the original Silver Tree of Heaven...and the last physical link to the divine.Knowing the history increases the beauty and potency of the films...to know what is REALLY at stake: the loss of the wisdom and awareness of heaven, the threat of the establishment of a demonic empire.As Denethor, Ruling Steward of Gondor, prepares for the war that will almost certainly end his nation, our heros return from victory over the fallen Wizard Saruman. As they and the people of Rohan rest and ready for the next stage of the war Pippin sneaks a look at the recovered Palantir of Isengard and comes face to face with the utter horror of Sauron, who had corrupted the seeing-stone network long ago. Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to assist and give warning while Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas help King Theoden muster the full strength of Rohan to ride to the defense of the White City.Gandalf and Pippin come to the capital and find Denethor in a kind of proud despair. Grief from the loss of his eldest son, Boromir, and knowledge from the Palantir of the White Tower about the awesome power of Sauron and the horror facing the certain doom of his civilization and all it's works was driving him to madness. Gandalf is forced to gradually assume command of the defense of the City.Frodo, Gollum, and Sam (who is the true hero of the tale) continue to make their way into Mordor. They face the rocky mountains of Mordor, horror of Minas Morgul, the treachery of Gollum, and the dreadfulness of Shelob before they finally enter the Black Land. Their final enemies on the trek to Mount Doom are deadly thirst and hunger and the sleepless watch of the Lidless Eye of Sauron.The forces of Evil have come to the City. The Great Gates of Gondor are broken and enemies poor under the archway that no enemy had ever passed before. Hope is lost...But there are forces at work besides the will of Evil. And they have not totally forgotten or abandoned the World...and that is an encouraging thought.Nothing can prepare you for the climax and the bittersweet epilogue..."	5.0	Truly loving the story means knowing the history...	2004-05-18	11	7	4

Actually, it was too short for the amount of material covered.  I think Peter Jackson would have been better served by making the movie as he did this extended version and having an intermission.  As it is, the movie without these scenes seemed choppy and incomplete.This new extended version makes for a much more satisfying viewing experience.  I especially enjoyed the extra scenes with Sarauman and Eowyn.This series is a masterpiece, a monumental achievment.  J.R.R.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	"MOVIE: The closing chapter to Peter Jackson's epic fantasy tale based on the famous book finally hits DVD. This best picture winner is the definition of epic. What really makes the film so enjoyable is not the intense battles or the amazing special effects, but the characters. We have watched these characters grow from the first film all the way to this. If the characters didn't work then the film would have been a failure. What Lord Of The Rings has going for it is that, yes it's a fictional tale between good and evil, but it relates to real world events both historic and modern. One other observation that I had is how similar this film resembles a game of chess. You've got the Orcs as the pawns, the Trolls and towers as the rooks, the Oliphants as the knights, the queen can bee seen as the witch king, and the king as Sauran. Then we have similar resemblances on the good side. Even in one scene Gandalf says,""the board is set, the pieces are moving"". The movie is the greatest fantasy epic ever made and an excellent closure to the trilogy. This will become a classic and is a masterpiece. I find it amazing how Peter Jackson came from doing bad horror films into something like this.VIDEO: Absolutely perfect, a flawless 2.35:1 widescreen presentation.AUDIO: A Dolby EX 5.1 mix that is just as amazing as the other films. The technical quality is consistent on all three theatrical editions of the film.PACKAGING / EXTRAS: This comes in a blue colored Armaray case. The first movie's color theme was green, the second was red, and the third blue. The extras are almost identical to the other two theatrical sets. You have some specials from different tv stations, the typical ""making of"", in depth featurettes, trailers, the near 7 minute long trailer for the entire series as a whole, a look at the EA games of the series, and your lordoftherings.net featurettes. As you know, the real meat is going to be in the extended edition this fall. A must have set that keeps the consistency of the series on DVD.Movie Score: (5 Stars / 5 Stars)DVD Score: (9 / 10)"	5.0	Peter Jackson's Closing Chapter To The Greatest Trilogy Ever	2004-05-26	1	1	0

I don't want it to end but we must all move on, yet it's scary thinking that we will never get to see Frodo and Sam again or to hear Merry and Pippin sing.

I found myself overcome with nausea upon viewing this film. I must say, the performances of each and every one of the actors and actresses were woeful, and truly disturbing, in the least. How this truly awful film came to win so many Academy Awards (TM) remains but a cryptic occurence in a world copious with hate. The excessive length induced a severe bowel movement, which eventually forced me to miss the last hour and tweleve minutes in the cinema loo. I must say, though, that I was somewhat glad to have missed so much of this terrible film.	1.0	Horrible, absolutely horrible.	2004-05-18	116	8	108

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1KAUV9QYLP52J	Kellyannl	Return of the King, although amazing battle sequences and special effects appropriately abound, ends as it should - with an emphasis on the fates of the four Hobbits with whom the Lord of the Rings trilogy first began, all of them very good people having to deal with experiences that none of them should have had to go through.  Such is war - whether in Middle Earth or the real world.As it begins, Smeagol/Gollum is pulling together his plans to kill Frodo and Sam to take the ring for himself.  Sam is acutely aware of this, but with Frodo unwilling to give the creature his walking papers (which considering his obsession would probably involve killing him), all loyal Sam can do is wait for Smeagol/Gollum to make his move as proximity to Mordor makes Frodo's mission ever more dangerous.Meanwhile, Frodo's young cousins, best friends Merry and Pippin, are having their own serious problems.  After they're reunited with the rest of the surviving Fellowship at Isengard, well intentioned but terminally curious Pippin picks up Saruman's palantir.  He then makes the biggest mistake of his life when he later takes a better look - and comes into direct contact with Sauron himself.The good news is that Pippin has somehow managed to keep Sauron from learning about Frodo's mission, and he has inadvertently drawn attention away from Frodo and Sam.  The bad news is that the Dark Lord now thinks Pippin himself has the ring.  This time, no chiding from Gandalf is necessary, as Pippin's actions have caused a side effect that, for him, is worse than any punishment the wizard could have thought up - he's going to have to leave Merry.  Pippin's glance into Sauron's mind has revealed to Gandalf the Dark Lord's next move - he plans to destroy Minas Tirith, the capital city of their fallen companion Boromir's beloved Gondor.  Gandalf and Pippin arrive at Minas Tirith in time to dig their heels in - and Pippin does what he can to help as we see the horrors of a full-fledged siege through his eyes and he finds himself in the middle of the twisted family issues between Boromir's father Denethor and brother Faramir.Meanwhile, Gondor does not go unaided.  With some urging from Aragorn, Theoden of Rohan prepares to go to her defense.  The Rohirrim's chances of success are slim, however, so Aragorn - with Legolas and Gimli with him as always - goes for some most unusual help.  Merry, knowing that Pippin is among those who might already be dying in the city, has no intention of just sitting by and doing nothing.  It seems that he's in for an agonizing wait, however, with none of the Rohirrim horsemen willing to take him on as a passenger and express orders from Theoden to stay put - until he finds sympathy and aid in carrying out his intentions from a most unexpected source.  So it is that he joins the cavalry charge that will turn into little more than a suicide mission if Aragorn does not arrive back in time.All the valiant efforts of the free peoples of Middle Earth will be for nothing, however, if Frodo fails.  And Frodo, with only Sam to bolster his will and the power of the ring warping his judgement, is systematically weakening...The big moments and special effects of the movie are a sight to behold.  The sweeping attack on Minas Tirith is truly frightening, and the charge of the Rohirrim, when it comes, is simply astonishing.  Smeagol/Gollum is once again an utter masterpiece.But the real reason why people have loved this story for decades is the relationships between the main characters.  At heart, it's all about the power of love between family and friends - and Peter Jackson has included plenty of quieter moments that remind us why we care so much about what happens to these people.There is, as with Fellowship and Two Towers, much left out even with the impressively long running time.  As before, the extended edition will presumably fill in alot of missing pieces and address many concerns of book readers - hence my reservation of one star.  As the trilogy closes, in the final analysis no, it's not the book - but on the whole we've been given a stunning interpretation of the War of the Rings that generally stayed true to Tolkien's vision, gave us some remarkable visuals that brought our wildest imaginings to life on film, and gave us wonderful interpretations of some of the most beloved characters in literature.	4.0	Full Circle	2003-12-27	10	6	4

For example, at the beginning of the extended edition, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and King Theoden ride to Isengard to treat with Saruman. This scene was cut from the original release, and it's inclusion here brings some clarity to how the Palantir came into Gandalf's possession. Also, the DVD contains several appendices about how the movie was made-the perfect treat for movie buffs. At 4 discs, this version offers the viewer as much LOTR as they can handle.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3NVN6RBBBQ0JQ	Kevin Pazyck	I purposely skipped the theatrical release knowing the Extended Edition (not necessarily Peter's absolute cinematic preference) would eventually hit the store shelves. I've seen the previous two EEs and both are world class DVD entertainment, so the RotK EE would have to bottom out hardcore for me not to feel gypped. I'm proud to say it is all the DVD I was anticipating.The screenplay is all that I could expect given the film medium and artistic licenses. It's been mentioned ad nausea how Pete, Fran and Philipa (along with cast input) could interpret Tolkien's book and RotK is another admirable example when it's done right. The new or extended scenes flesh out the story better than if not included. Like the previous installments.The video is sharp and should come as no surprise given the source technology responsible for its production. To try to find any more fault with as compared to FotR or the TT would be an exercise in futility. For that matter, the audio is blessedly awesome. It's demo reference perfect. And for those with DTS 6.1 home theatres, strap on your Frodo bib and smile ear to ear.The concept of the two supplementary discs is prettyy much on par with the other two movies. In a nutshell, a (more than) thorough look at the total production of t he movie. It will take some viewers more than one or two sittings to digest the info. the DVD-ROM content is also fairly much on par with the other two.The four seperate commentary track choices are once again worthy of one's time if willing. All you could wanna know from the different aspaects of the making of RotK. If there is one tiny annoyance, it's Dominic and Billy's slapstick routine. By the third installment, it gets tactless. Their humor was fun and timely at first with FotR, but they get just a little too comfy with the microphone, I realize four hours is a long time to listen to actors' memories. But their attempts at levity begin to cheapen what all have accomplished with the Trilogy. And I hope that's not forgotten all too quickly by today's fans.But enough of that. For even around 30 bucks, the DVD is definitely worth it. They did not skimp out and again I thank New LIne Cinema for having the financial confidence in the Lord of the Rings. For Peter's vision and drive and imagination wouldn't mean squat if he didn't have the backing necessary to realize it. Buy. Now. Frodo lives. Just not at....	5.0	perfect closure	2005-01-04	7	7	0

And let me tell you, it looked awsome.  I sneak peak didn't show much, but it did show some.  Some ineresting things is that Saruman thinks that the hobbit Pipen has the ring.  Also, in the battle of Helm's Deep in the Two Towers, there were 10,000 soldiers under Saruman.  In the new battle in Return of the King, there are 200,000 soldiers under Saruman.

Ignat ""A costumer"""	"The movie ""The Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King"" far surpasses its pedecessors.  The story continues nicely from ""The Two Towers"" and the extra scene of how gollum found the ring was also neat.  But the best part about this movie was not the storyline, or the FX, or the character roles, but Minas Tirith, the capitol of Gondor, being attacked by over 200,000 orcs.The first cool thing about the battle was that the orcs are the coolest evil army that I have ever seen.  Thier armies were mind-boggling out in pellenor fields in the one shot where the duke of Gondor looks down.  They amass on Minas Tirith with countless armies, belfreys (those big towers), and catapults, and just when you think Rohan and Gondor just won, you hear the huge drums of the Southerners (and these arent hilbillies, they're savage hethens) on thier olephents.Theoden gives an impressive speech as well.  It didn't touch me enough to cry, but it was pretty moving.  The only bad thing (and I mean the ONLY bad thing) about Minas Tirith is when the duke of Gondor is slowly twisted insane and lit on fire.  Then he jumps off the highest peak in Minas Tirith, a flaming corpse, and falls onto Pellenor Fields.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah, and the ghost army was a bit lame.Overall, the movie was good.  I loved it more then the 2nd, and WAY more then the 1st.  Minas Tirith, claimed by real critics to be the biggest battle scene ever filmed.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2NNTNC715AJ50	"Kindle Customer ""JKM"""	I saw Return of the King on opening night and I was blown away by it.  Once again Peter Jackson perfectly captured the spirit of JRR Tolkien's epic trilogy.  The atypical beginning, featuring the origin of Gollum set a very in-depth tone for the movie.  As Frodo and Sam move closer and closer to the fulfillment of the Quest, their friends move to battle the armies of Mordor in the city of Minas Tirith.  As with the other two films in this trilogy, there are moments of great action, high adventure, stunning emotion, fine humor and pure movie magic.  THe lighting of the beacon's is one such moment.  As the theme for Gondor blares, the camera follows the fire as it warns across the country to the kingdom of Rohan.  Merry and Pippin once again add in a more mature humor, while the actors once again give masterful performances.  The battle of Peleanor fields is a great scene filled with fantastic images and high emotion, while it is balanced by a small intimate scene where Gandalf describes the undying realms to Pippin when it appears that they are going to die.  The only problem I really had with the theatrical release was that the palantir in Minas Tirith was overlooked and I felt it would be better if Gollum simply fell over the edge as in the book and not struggle with Frodo.  The ending leaves out scenes from the book where the Shire has to be freed, but the movie does not feel it's loss, and the bittersweet ending is beautiful.  There will never again be movies such as these and I'm glad I was able to witness their brilliance on the theater screen and the dvd releases.	5.0	Excellent and Emotional Conclusion to a Great Trilogy	2005-05-08	3	2	1

Now I know. Of all three films (all of which I would rate 5 star), ""Return of the King"" is the one most enhanced by the extended and extra scenes. The overall flow of the story is improved, rather than hampered, and the details added can't help but delight almost all Tolkien fans everywhere.I could go on and on about each scene, but I would hate to spoil anything, especially if anyone was disappointed by specific scenes not included in the theatrical release. No, not everything is there, but the extra features are absolutely a treat.Aside from the continuing high quality of the production, the two DVDs of documentary included continue the story of the making of the films and bring them to a very heartfelt conclusion. There is enough here to make any viewer feel as if they were right there as the films were being made.Time after time, the cast and crew show what love and craft went into this production. Though not all Tolkien fans will agree with the decisions made by Peter Jackson, an examination of the documentaries at least explains why the decisions were made. Personally, I agree with almost everything Jackson did.Not to be missed is the biography of Cameron Duncan, who was the inspiration for the song ""Into the West"", featured at the end of the film.The extended release transforms ""Return of the King"" from merely an excellent film to an absolutely mind blowing experience. If you enjoyed the extra footage included in the extended releases of the first two movies, you will be completely blown away by this new version of ""Return of the King""."	5.0	The Holy Grail	2004-12-19	3	3	0

Frodo continues his quest to destroy the one ring. Darkness reigns upon them as Sauron calls on his army to search for the ring and destroy anything in it's wake.It had a very dramatic ending. When we all think that Golum could still be transformed and turned back to the good side, he is actually the one who can't stand to take the ring away from Frodo's hands and falls to his death in Mordor.With Gandalf back, Merry and Pippin found, Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli back from their search for the rest, they head for Minas Tirith where the big war is fought. Orcs and orgres emerge from mordor for the fight.The visual effects together with the soundtrack had a very equal blend. Everything just fitted perfectly like a jigsaw puzzle.The scenery was amazingly spectacular.I bought all 3 DVDs because of all the popularity it received and I didn't regret a single bit. I'm even happy I didn't watch the movies in the cinema and have to wait every year for a coninuation. Watching all 3 in DVD non-stop is one thing I hardly do but in this case, you just can't stop sometimes.I also recommend you all to buy the soundtrack.

Its a plot used in many stories, but one unique thing that Tolkien does in LotR is that while writting about hte main characters quest to destroy the item he also talkes about other people in the world and their struggle to fight the ultimate evil in their own ways, such as wagging oper war upon it or setting up decoys to help the main characters travel safer. Tolkien has laidened his work with countless allusions and symbolism which allows for a deeper meaning throughout the story and gives backstory to many characters, be they magor, main, or even obscurley minor characters that only say 3 words befor they go riding off to battle and die on the next page.

He brings new meaning to the word fantasy. Return of the King is obviously the best movie out of the Lord of the rings trilogy. The war scenes have grown more intense then the first two. Also the journeys that all the main characters have been going threw during the first two films have reached a dramatic and emotional end. New enemies come to the screen like the Mumakil(Gigantic war elephants), the Witch King, and Mordor orcs. The visual and special effects are unbelievable. Jacksons creation of the battle scenes in Return of the King are mindblowing. I thought the battle at Minas Tirith was the best scene in the movie. This DVD is a must get for all you movie goers.

Sadler"""	I am glad to see I am not the only person who finds the closing of the series of LOTR makes me extremely sad. I remember how excited I was four years ago when browsing on the web I found out that the LOTR was being made. I was fearful of what would be done to this classic book, as all the movies to this point were atrocious. But after I saw the first film in this series I relaxed, and went with the flow.I beg to differ with some who felt the length and the multiple endings of this film were too much. Read your Tolkien. He also had multiple endings. When you have so many important characters, Tolkien knew there had to be an explanation for what happened to them after the quest had been fulfilled. He could not drop it at the place where the Ring and Gollum fell into the fire. Jackson may have made a mistake on editing as per having the screen go completely dark, but otherwise I felt this part of the series to be as strong as the first film, and complete.Lovers of Tolkien will complain that Jackson changed the story slightly. I think Tolkien would have approved of most of the changes. A king has to have a queen, and in many ways, the books were lacking in female presence. Jackson and his co-workers made up for that lack of presence, and I found it in keeping with Tolkien's mythology. Our world has changed. Though women did not participate in WWI (during Tolkien's time in battle), they were present during WWII, during Vietnam, and they are participators in current wars, for good or for evil. Strong women as presented in Jackson masterpiece are a part of our world, and fight alongside our men to preserve our freedoms and our homes, their homes. That needs to be recognized.I am waiting for the extended version of this movie to come out and then will buy all three extended versions together and give our current DVDs to my kids. The series, the three movies deserved recognition at the Oscars for doing something that had never been done before...making a classic tale, a long one, into a masterpiece by shooting three movies at the same time.

Ross ""Kristy"""	"Being a big fan of Tolkein's epic story, I was disappointed with the final chapter in Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, THE RETURN OF THE KING. Slow pacing, unnecessary waffling in Rohan, and the complete loss of several great villains, namely Christopher Lee's Saruman, Brad Dourif's Wormtounge and The Mouth Of Sauron (Bruce Spence). When watching ROTK, I could pinpoint the exact moment where Jackson had become a complete sell out. All through FELLOWSHIP and TWO TOWERS the evil istari Saruman has been the main villain, primarily because P.J wanted a more substantial bad guy than a flaming eye. It's like the old saying: ""Every great hero needs a villain"". But for all the great cinematic battles that Saruman unleashes, his character has to come to a spectacular end. The aforementioned point of complete botch-up is where Gandalf, Theoden et all ride to Isengard for no other reason than to pick up a palantri that has little to do with the story. No evil wizard, nothing. Booo! And how unsporting to axe a great villain without even informing Mr. Lee. Now, one could understand that this would be caused as a result of the running time being too long, but then if that's the case, why not shorten the snooze-inducing lighting of the beacons, or axe long sappy hobbit wafflings. Now this would be slightly more acceptable if the main Orc guy leading the hosts of Mordor had a good role, however his fight with Aragorn, which would have been really neat, was unceremoniously ripped from the film. Not to mention the Gandalf and Witch-King fight that never happens in the movie, leaving the Witch King talking to the main orc, who says: ""What of the wizard?"" The Witch King says: ""I will break him!"" Or not.Now, that's not to say that the movie is without spectacle, indeed the arrival of the Oliphants and some impressive Pellenor Fields fighting is fantastic cinema. And of course Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Bernard Hill etc are all excellent, but the film had an unfinished feel to it. Which of course brings us to the EXTENDED DVD version. Now I can throw the old cinema release DVD away, watch this version with all the mentioned scenes reinstated, and be satisfied.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1VB2XZT3VV5YF	Kurtmt	This platinum 4-disc set caps off the extended versions of the trilogy extremely well. A few added scenes seem superfluous or silly, such as***SPOILERS***the corsairs and the mountain of skulls***SPOILERS END***and many of Denethor's added bits are hard to watch due to the actor's overuse of the 'quivering face technique'. But overall, the new scenes substantially improve on the theatrical release by adding some scenes inspired by the book in addition to many character moments.The extras are laid out almost identically to both previous extended sets. They continue to be very in-depth and are more personal this time since this is the last behind-the-scenes hurrah for the cast/crew to say goodbye. The documentary on the post-production process shows how much labor of love and endurance went into this  often painful enterprise. The same goes for the people who made this DVD by repeating the process of adding new special effects, sounds, music, color grading and editing skill for the ~50 minutes of bonus footage. Not to mention getting the actors to once again loop dialogue for all of it, a necessary improvement over the bonus scenes in FOTR-extended where they used the scratchy dialogue recorded on set.Looking back on the finished movies, Fellowship of the Ring in either version is, to me, still the best of the three with less dependence on spectacle and a melancholy, austere storybook feel that's missing in the others. In any case, my thanks go out to Peter Jackson & company. These are the only movies that I felt I got more than my money's worth, both in the theater and at home.	5.0	3 for 3	2005-01-16	6	4	2

Wyatt ""ssintrepid"""	"The Lord of the Rings - ""The Return of the King"" and the preceding two movies will undoubtedly go down in history as the ultimate cinematic trilogy/epic to have ever graced the silver screen!  Tolkien purists take heart for Peter Jackson's version is probably the best a director could've done with Tolkien's masterpiece giving great consideration to the width, breadth and scope of the entire epic.After having viewed the extended versions and all of the special features of the first two movies, one thing is certain, all those involved in the making of this epic, from the director down to the poor actors in orc suits poured as much attention to detail and love and affection for Tolkien's words into these movies as they possibly could.In ""The Return of the King"" we're not only treated to the exceptional conclusion of this epic story that has taken a total of two years to get to but we're also treated to even that much more in the way of amazing scenery and imagery as Peter Jackson brings this epic to its conclusion.  The final battles between the combined forces of Gondor and Rohan against Sauron and his minions is, simply put, the most astonishing battle to have ever graced the silver screen!High praise goes to Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen and all of the other exceptional actors that brought these fantasy/historical characters to life, throughout this and the preceding two movies.  Exceptional high praise goes to Andy Serkis who brought Gollum to life despite not having actually been seen himself on screen until this third movie.Director Peter Jackson deserves all of the high praise and accolades that he has and will continue to receive for bringing ""The Lord of the Rings"" to fruition and doing it in such an incomparable manner considering that many attempts in the past to bring fantasy stories to the theaters have been done so poorly and resulted, almost all of the time, in flops.  The Score for ""The Return of the King"" and the preceding two movies proved to be an exceptional accoutrement to the entire story.The Premise:From the opening scene in this movie, where we finally see Andy Serkis on the screen as Sm&eacute;agol, in which it is a long time ago and his friend Deagol finds the ring and he becomes obsessed with it upon sight to the closing scenes which pay ultimate tribute to Tolkien's work, ""The Return of the King"" is an engaging and enthralling conclusion to everything that was set up in the first two films...I highly recommend this film and of course the preceding two to those that have not taken the opportunity to view J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece as perceived by director Peter Jackson and brought in magical detail to the silver screen and DVD!  I don't know if Peter Jackson and company have any plans to do so but they certainly have the tools in place to bring ""The Hobbit"" to the silver screen as well and it would be an absolutely wondrous thing if he did!  {ssintrepid}"	5.0	LOTR The Return of the King - A brilliant conclusion!	2003-12-26	5	4	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2D4KYA86MLHM5	"kybernetes ""kybernetes"""	Director Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece of cinematography.  The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is the best adaptation of a book done on film.  Jackson has crafted this film so that it is still eminently watchable to those who haven't read the books.  There are so many powerful scenes in this movie that you will be rivited to your seat the entire three and a half hours.Sean Astin's performance of Samwise Gamgee is heroic.  The range of emotions he convincingly displays should garner him an oscar nomination.  The rest of the cast is only a step behind.A battle scenes are absolutley astounding.  While the Twin Towers had probably the best fantasy battle scenes done to date, Return of the King has eclipsed it.  The realism in the costume design, seige weapons and battle tactices is terrific.The only real gripe Die hard Tolkien fans will have concerns the Spider Shelob.  While Shelob is certainly scary and impressive, she is portrayed more as a large vicious spider than as an immortal Demon.As a bottom line, nobody could have possibly imagined the trilogy being as well done as has been accomplished.  The same can be said of the Return of the King.  Attention to detail and the spirit of Tolkien oozes out of every pore of this movie.	5.0	Return of the King is a Must See Movie	2003-12-18	1	1	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2ZFAYA9NKP2SA	LadyArmand	To the loyalists amongst us let me just say that while some liberties were taken with the original text, they were certainly not enough to keep anyone from enjoying this masterpiece of fantasy cinema.  What Peter Jackson his writing staff, producing staff and gloriously underrated and underappreciated cast have proven with this film is that good writing, excellent acting and wonderful pacing can take a film from being just another movie to a cinematic event. One filled with awe inspiring heroism, angst, loyalty, love, and a fierce sense of purpose. While at the same time making the events and emotions relatable bringing them back down to human scale so that we may examine them more closely.  The heroism, angst, loyalty, love and a sense of purpose isn't without its price and the price is high.  It's paid in lives and a sense of longing that permeates the whole film.Yes there are a lot of special effects in the film, some that are so grand and wondrous that one is wont to describe them but words fail.  There are effects that level the viewer leaving them gasping for breath at the beauty and brilliance of them, while others are nearly invisible because of their subtlety.  But if the trilogy has taught us anything it is that effects don't make a film, they may enhance it but the driving force behind any film of merit is the direction, the performances and the story being told.Return of the King deals with good and evil on a grand scale, while bringing it down to a level of the everyday.  Frodo and Sam are still on their journey to Mount Doom, being led by the horribly conflicted Smeagol/Gollum, who has been so tortured by the Ring and want of the Ring that basically all he is at this point is an addict. Who is willing to do whatever he has to do in order to get the Ring back into his possession even leading Frodo and Sam to Shelobe's lair. You see the disease of addiction being played out in one of the most brilliant performances of the film.Merry and Pippin are given a much larger role to play in the final battle then in the previous two films. They are separated due to Pippin insatiable curiosity.  Both are faced with choices that test who they are, while demonstrating the strength of their bond.Gandolf's metal is also tested once he arrives in the kingdom of Gondor.  He must lead the people into battle until Aragorn can get there and take on his role as King.Aragorn finally comes to terms with who he was always meant to be, who he is.  He is the King of Men, who must lead his people against the forces of Mordor and take the battle for Middle Earth to the Black Gates in order to buy time for Fordo and Sam to reach the fires in the heart of Mount Doom.His uncertainty is palpable as he takes on the heavy mantel being given to him.  And yet he does so, with a grace that speaks to his nobility and his sense of what is right.  At the Black Gates he is tested one last time and find that he is his own man, that the blood that runs through his veins does not dictate what he will do. He is his own man.  He is the King of the people of the West.	5.0	Absolutely Wonderful.....	2004-03-27	3	3	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AL69GCA7D00XV	LagunaDave	"I don't think this extended edition adds much to the theatrical version; certainly it is not as big an improvement as the extended editions of the first two films.  It does make it...longer.From every technical angle, the entire series is a wonder.  What has bothered me increasingly, ever since FotR, is Jackson's laziness in screenplay and script.  He and his co-directors/writers increasingly substituted their own dialog and story ideas, which are only one step above the leaden drivel found in the Star Wars films, for Tolkien's beautiful prose and plot.  With effort, they could have produced a great film which didn't require inflicting such indignities on Tolkien's opus.When I saw there was a Corsairs of Umbar scene, I prayed Jackson had removed the excruciating and senseless scene where the Army of Dead annihilates the whole attacking force at Minas Tirith (making the valor of everyone else, from the Rohirrim, to the defenders of the city, and Aragorn himself, pointless).  No such luck.I hoped the EE would include the powerful and beautiful scenes in the Houses of Healing (first with Aragorn as a healer, then between Faramir and Eowyn).  Instead we get a throwaway of Aragorn daubing Eowyn's brow, and one line of dialog between Faramir and Eowyn.  More screen time is devoted to the offensive and idiotic ""drinking game"" between Legolas and Gimli than to these two scenes combined.We see Aragorn beheading the Mouth of Sauron during a parley, when the scene as written by Tolkien (with the Mouth of Sauron revealing his inner cowardice and Aragorn displaying his nobility) was far, far better.And of course, with the omission of the Scouring of the Shire (which was never even filmed), Jackson manages to completely miss the point of the entire trilogy.There are a few good new scenes.  The conclusion of the Saruman plotline, despite (again) violating Tolkien's vision, was better than I expected.  The scenes between Pippin and Faramir, and Faramir and Denethor (with a cameo by the ghost of Boromir) were good.  The additional Paths of the Dead footage was welcome, until it degenerated into self-parody with the avalanche of more skulls than the entire population of Middle Earth.As the editorial review noted, Jackson made the right cuts (but not the right script/screenplay decisions) in the theatrical version, so there is little here that truly adds to it.Sadly, short of major reworking to cleanse the screenplay of Jackson's ""improvements"", and additional filming, his effort will never be a faithful and satisfying telling of the most popular tale of the 20th century, despite the great casting, costuming, props, special effects, cinematography, and everything else."	3.0	Flawed masterpiece	2004-12-22	24	16	8
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1G7AOD9OXY000	"Lai Michael ""PandaWAPS"""	At the end of The Two Towers, Gandalf says the battle of Helm&iexcl; Deep is over, the battle of Middle-earth is about to begin. In a sense, that does sum up The Return of the King. Helm&iexcl; Deep was really just an opening skirmish. And the real battle is happen right now between the men, elves and the orcs.Saruon comes to believe that men still have courage to encounter his force and men are not weak as his supposed. He will not risk the people of middle-earth united again. He fears the King of Gondor return. Therefore Saruon brings all his army to Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor. He wishes to stick down the city to the ground in order to make the middle-earth fall in shadow again. The world is in dangerous.Gandalf rides to Minas Tirith for alert to the Kingdom of Gondor. The leadership of Gondor is in the hand of the stewards who are supposed to be the caretakers for the throne. However Denethor, the stewards, don&iexcl; wish to bow to Aragorn. Gandalf raise the beacons of Minas Tirith, Rohan answered. Although Gondor didn&iexcl; come to the aid before, the riders of Rohan are summoned to the aid of Gondor. And in the Pelennor Fields they fought for the freedom of middle-earth.On an external level we have the massive war, and on an internal level we have 2 little hobbits, Frodo and Sam. They are on their hands and knees literally crawling up a mountain. It is the relationship between two nice characters. It is the heart of the movie. They face the adventure with trust, friendship, confidence and mission. Gollum wish to sow discord the fellowship between them. And you can imagine the pain and suffer in their journey.The movie brings a message: At what cost will good win? People always believe justice is always happen around the world. The evil cannot win the good. But they did not think everything have its price. Although at last the ring destroyed and Aragorn become the King again. There is great lost as well. Theoden, the King of Rohan dead in the battle. Frodo always lost his finger. There is also lost many solders and warriors of Gondor and Rohan. The unexpected is Gandalf and Frodo go to Undying land with the Elves at last. Many people come to believe that it is a fate of the ring-bearers.The position of the Lord of the Rings can beyond Star Wars in my point of view. It considers all situations which we will face. Like the forbidden love between Aragorn and Arwen, the friendship between Fordo and Sam, the battle between human and evil, the different between 2 wizards Gandalf and Saruman.None of us can imagine from The Fellowship of the Ring, the fellowship will be broken into 3 parts. Fordo and Sam continues their journey to Mount Doom. Gandalf and Aragorn leads the mankind resist the evils. Pippen and Merry becomes a warrior. They find themselves with an army that going into battle with.The whole movie runs 200 minutes. And there is even no time for you to think. I have waited this firm since The Two Towers. There has been almost 1 year. And it is very glad that if finally in theater. There are many huge battle senses and emotional stories. The only regret is the director Peter Jackson cut many sense in order to make the firm run only around 3 hours. Many of my friends and allies always purpose this problem.This movie also makes us to understand that man should be united in our common interest. We all live in the same planet. We all breathe the same air. We should not separate by only selfish or our own meaningless will. Of course Saruon would not appear in the real world, but the spirit always exists. Men always own guilty in their mind. They are weak to resist evil. They are scattered, divided, leaderless and unsatisfied. If we let this situation continue happen, men will fall in no time.All we shall do is make our world peaceful and fortune. Let us make our dream &iexcl;V Utopia to come true. Let us make every child have their right to be educated. Let us make our world have resources to help the beggars. And let us always look down show some mercy to everybody.One small step of us, there will be one great step for all mankind. Let us hope tomorrow the future of mankind will be brighter than everything.	5.0	The Best of the Best	2004-03-12	6	4	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AP28EU980272X	Lakan Kildap	"It's not out yet, I know, but this is our chance to predict what we might see in the movie.  After watching Two Towers, here are my predictions, and wishes...Book events left out of movie:1. Aragorn's passage to the Paths of the Dead, consequently, battles fought in Lebennin and Pelargir2. Madness/Pyre of Denethor3. Scouring of the Shireall above events will have to be left out to concentrate on one main battle, the battle of the Pelennor fields.  We already saw something like this in Two Towers, where Haldir was transplanted to Helm's Deep. (The elves really did fight, you know, but in Lorien and in Mirkwood.)Changes from book:1. Aragorn will ride direct to Gondor with the Rohirrim2. Instead of Theoden, Aragorn will face down Lord of the Nazgul.3. True to form, he stumbles yet again before this formidable foe.  Previously in the two movies, he was a) knocked out cold by a stone troll in Moria b) carried off a cliff by a Warg4. Instead of Eowyn, it is Arwen who rescues Aragorn and slays the Lord of the Nazgul5. Denethor or Faramir, or both, will contest Aragorn's claim to the throne of Gondor6. Shelob may or may not come, if she comes, it will be right before the end, at the foot of Barad-dur, barring the way7. Gollum will sacrifice himself so Frodo and Sam can go on8. Destruction of the Ring and the fall of Sauron will take place just when the Pelennor is about to be lost, sort of like Mummy Returns.  Thus, two victories at the same time.  There will be no need for the victors to march on MordorWhat I'd like to see:1. Aragorn wakes up and marries Eowyn instead.  I mean, at the hint of peril, Arwen (in the movie Two Towers) asks her father what to do.  At the moment of greatest peril, Eowyn (in the book) defies her foster father, dresses like a man, rides to battle, faces down and kills the Lord of the Nazgul, something no man could have done.  If you were Aragorn, whom would you choose?2. Legolas and Arwen fall in love and marry, and they both pass over the Sea and into the West.  It's only fitting, isn't it?3. Frodo throws himself in.  That would be the fitting end to all his troubles.  I can only stand so many hours watching Elijah Wood's wide eyed expressions.4. Aragorn really becomes the heir of Isildur.  No, even better, the heir of Elendil, and Elros, and Beren and Barahir.  Memo to director Peter Jackson:  Aragorn is a descendant of the Kings of Numenor, and of the Edain, men equal to elves except in length of life.  They were a race of supermen.  No need to ""humanize"" Aragorn.  After all, who's to believe he was 89 years old when the war was joined, still strong and enduring, and mightier than even Theoden, who was actually younger, if he (Aragorn) weren't some kind of superman?  We can believe anything, Mr. Peter.  That's what we go to the moviehouse for, to suspend disbelief.I can't wait to see it happen."	3.0	OK, I'll bite	2003-02-10	84	19	65

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1X7HU8ZZI1CTN	"Larry Oliver ""wolvie05"""	The first thing I can say about this extended edition of Return of the King, is that it fits more easily with TTT extended edition. The scenes with Saruman and the more detailed look into the fates of Theoden and Eowyn complete their stories more fully.In fact Eowyn becomes an even stronger character here.The scene where Eomer finds her lifeless body is chilling and heartbreaking. I just wish they had followed the book more closely and allowed Theoden an honorable burial.I welcome the lengthier dialogue, which reads more like Tolkien.  Saruman's speech reveals his reasoning forattacking the world of men. He's arrogant and feels his knowledge gives him power over their fate.On the other hand,  the extended cut feels too long and many of the newly included scenes seem gratuitous. Do we need to know that Pippin's armor once belonged to Faramir? Jackson seems to be explaining many things we took for granted in the film version. Like the army of the dead. You know they agreed to Aragorns offer, when they all show up at Pellenor Field.  Showing their ghostly attack earlier in the film dilutes that great shot of Aragorn leaping from the black ship, thousands of ghostly green soldier following his lead. It's hard to feel anything when the Mouth of Sauron shows up with bad news about Frodo. We already know he is alive.Basically Peter Jackson and his co-writers wanted to give everyone their due and respects the work of his actors enough to restore their deleted scenes.

Bryant ""kc130fr"""	"Doing a ""blue collar"" review of this movie is at best difficult.  I sat for the three and a half hours in a theater with two hundred plus other people totally engulfed by this production.  Though not faithful to the books I read for the first time in Vietnam, the story flowed beautifully with no breaks (those places that inevitably occur in most movies where you look around and see what other people are doing) in the story line. Peter Jackson and Company have brought to the screen a visually stunning, action packed, and, in places, a heart wrenching version of this third installment of Tolkien's masterpiece.  The setting selections coupled with the special effects make this one of the great visual epics of all time.  I was especially taken with the performance of Sean Astin (Sam) during the scenes with Frodo after reaching Shelob's lair.  I actually heard the lady beside me crying during the scene where Sam thinks Frodo is dead and again on the side of Mount Doom.  Though overlooked for major awards, Mr. Astin proved, at least to this reviewer, that he is a fine actor.  The battle scene before the gates of Gondor was the most visually exciting segment of the movie with Orlando Bloom's (Legolas) battle with the giant elephant capping it.  Elijah Wood (Frodo), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), and Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf) turned in their normal solid supurb performances begun in the first and second movies.  While the part of Arwen was played beautifully by Liv Tyler, I didn't care for insertion of a love story that was only hinted at in the books.  Mr. Jackson was able, though, to make the story flow naturally as if it was part of the original story.  I was also a little bewildered by the number of endings the film seemed to have.  For the last five minutes of screen time I, not being an individual who stays for the on screen credits, felt like a jack-in-the-box.  Movies, in my mind, should be like an classical music overture and give you one good loud ending after which the director puts down his wand and bows.  This grand movie seems to be like we who have been watching the trilogy for over two years now.  It and we didn't want it to end.  Probably the best thing about this movie and it's two prevously released installments is that young and old will be watching on the edge of their seats and enjoying this future classic long after I'm history.  If you haven't seen the movie you've missed one of the great ""feel-good"" experiences in cinematic history."	5.0	LOTR - ROTK - Heart Wrenching Eye Candy	2004-03-19	17	14	3
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2X3M0LWJX96VL	Laura Bellamy	"I honestly thought that nothing could ever top the first two ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, but lo and behold, I was wrong.  This third and final installment of J.R.R. Tolkien's phenomenal epic trilogy was the single most incredible film I have ever seen.  And altogether, the entire trilogy makes for the most marvelous piece of cinematic genius ever to hit the big screen or touch the hearts and souls of its many viewers.  How many films can YOU think of where an audience will willingly and even READILY sit through eleven or more hours of footage?Some key points on this particular work:  Jackson's vision is incredible in this film, and it comes out so clearly that it truly makes the viewer feel like they are actually there.  Jackson creates the world of Middle Earth so convincingly that you could swear you were actually there, that it actually existed.The characters have become beloved.  Sam especially warms my heart; this is HIS story more than anyone else's.  Merry and Pippin grow up quite a lot throughout this trilogy, and that is never made more evident than in this film.  One of the most telling scenes in the film is near the end, back in Shire, where the four hobbits are surrounded by their old life, and are so much changed that they know they'll never QUITE belong there in the same way again.  Smeagol/Gollum was the most amazing thing I have ever seen, that character was more real than almost any other in the film.The music is heartwrenching.  In particular, the scene in which Pippin sings made me cry.  That song was so beautifully haunting that it cut you right to the soul.  I was left utterly breathless.The story itself IS altered slightly from that of the book, but that is hardly surprising.  I challenge anyone to find a movie that EXACTLY depicts the book it is based off of...there aren't any, and if there are some somewhere, they probably didn't work, because the two forms are so different.  The best you can hope for is to keep as many key plot points as possible and still keep the feel and SPIRIT of the book, and Jackson has done that most impressively.  Many might be annoyed that they did not even bother filming the Scouring of the Shire, but they already had enough endings to this movie, and it flowed so perfectly as it was that the Scouring of the Shire would have unhinged it too much.There are many white-knuckle scenes, and many other tender ones.  The balance between the two is excellent, and it rounds out the story quite nicely.On the whole, there has never been any film -- certainly no trilogy -- that has ever even come close to matching this one.  There is so much heart, so much love, that went into this production, and you feel it.  I came away from this movie absolutely astounded, not even able to put into words what I felt -- not sure there were even words INVENTED to describe this masterpiece.  I sat through well over 3 hours' worth of material, but it felt like MUCH less, so absorbed was I in the happenings on the screen.Lord of the Rings is already a classic, as far as I'm concerned, and deservedly so.  Fifty years from now, people will still regard these movies as among the best, most poignant, most PHENOMENAL films in cinematic history.Bravo to Jackson, his excellent cast, and his dedicated crew.  They are cinematic giants"	5.0	The best movie from the BEST trilogy!	2004-01-10	10	9	1

All of the special features are not rehashing the special features of the other two extended version DVDs, but show new details of the filming and post production.  One of my favorites was the Oscar night scenes and the elation of the cast and crew.  Another favorite was the good-bye scenes for all the major cast members as they filmed their last pick-up scenes, especially Elijah Wood's.The new scenes are great, adding yet more of Tolkien's words and story to the already brilliant film.  I loved the additional scene of Faramir and Eowyn connecting--two characters who had been through great personal loss and emotional pain, finding a soulmate in the other--which was a favorite part of the book for me.  I also liked the Saruman scenes eventhough that was not like the book.You really get your money's worth with these LOTR extended versions.

The reson why it was not ""great"" or ""perfect"" is becouse it was manily about that stuip hobbit Pipin. Don't let the title fool you, this movie did not have alot of Aragorn( and they did not talk about him alot ethier). This is good for people who wan't to see alot of fights. The ending in this is completely diffrent from the ending from the book so if you wanted to see the book ending you will be disapointed. The spider sceane was short, but great.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	I am sure I am by no means alone in having arranged my day to enjoy the entire trilogy, watching both of the special edition DVDs of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; taking a break only to go to the theater to buy tickets for the late night showing so I could end the day seeing &quot;The Return of the King.&quot;  After the disappointments of &quot;The Return of the Jedi,&quot; &quot;The Matrix: Revolutions,&quot; and even &quot;The Godfather: Part III,&quot; we come to a world in which &quot;The Trilogy&quot; will now refer to Peter Jackson's films in the world of cinema the same way it does to J.R.R. Tolkien's novels in the realm of literature.Things I am savoring the morning after:The ride of the Rohirrim at the Battle of the Pelennor Field.  This ends up being the greatest cavalry charge in cinematic history, as well as the biggest battle scene of all time.  Not only do you have the attack, but the counter-attack, and then the Lord of the Nazgul.  I wish such scenes did not rely so much on hand-held cameras and jump cuts, but that is the way of the cinematic world.  However, it was especially gratifying that the biggest cheer of the night came in my favorite scene from the trilogy, when Eowyn faces the foul dwimmerlaik, although I think Jackson really could have heightened the drama of the moment a lot better and I missed hearing her laugh and speak in a clear voice like the ring of steel.The army of Sauron laying siege of Gondor.  The oliphants were impressive, but so were the catapults flings rocks and pieces of masonry at each other, and the great trolls working the machines of war.  For that matter, the first sight of Minas Tirith was as grand as our first look at Rivendell.The emergence of Pippin as a strong character.  My only serious complaint early on was that Merry and Pippin were the comic relief, a role that was passed on to Gimli (but really belongs to Sam if anybody), and in his service to the Steward of Gondor we finally see Pippin, well, grow up.  And who would have expected that a particularly poignant moment in the film would be Pippin singing a song?Getting to see Andy Serkis as a non-computer generated Smeago.  This is a nice cameo for someone who put on one of the greatest vocal performances in movie history.  The Smeagol-Gollum argument in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; actually created sympathy for this sad little creature, and the credit goes to what Serkis did with his voice, so it seems right that we get to see his face.The idea that in the end, this really is Sam's story.  Not only because he gets the last line in the movie as he does the book, but also because when all is said and done he is the most heroic figure of them all, fighting on for the best of reasons.In the end I was most impressed by how Jackson changed the pivotal moment at Mount Doom, which was a brief scene in the book, into something much more in keeping with the characters and their situation.  Jackson not only sets this up with the flashback that opens the film, but even after the final fate of the ring, where it echoes in a conversation between Bilbo and Frodo.Overall Jackson's tinkering with the sacred text worked well, with expanding the role of Arwen Undomiel so that she was more than King Elessar's Midsummer bride and having Eowyn fix her eye upon Aragorn.  I always appreciated the scouring of the Shire as being appropriate to the sensibilities of an English audience that had endured the Blitz and World War II, but times have changed and the characters clearly bear their own physical and emotional scarring.Yes, devotes of Tolkien's work will all have quibbles with what has been omitted (e.g., Gandalf's confrontation with the Lord of the Nazgul), but hopefully for most of us that just means waiting eleven months for the special edition DVD to be released.  Maybe they will do it sooner next year since it will not have to prime us for the next movie.	5.0	Frodo, Sam and the rest of us come to the end of all things	2003-12-20	33	28	5
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A18G8OR9MPK77X	L. Brooks	I loved this movie more than the previous two.  I only went to see the first movie because of my mother.  She was a true fan the books and it was something she would have dragged me too see.  I left the theater understanding her love of the books.  So I decided to read all three of them before the second movie came out and was hooked.  I waited with baited breath for the second film and left the movie theater in a daze.  When the third one came out,  my then roomate and I were just glued to our seats when it was over.  An almost four hour movie went by in a matter of minutes in our minds.  We wanted more but I had read the books and knew it was over. We just sat and talked how we wished my mother was there because she would have been sitting in the seat next to us just as mesmerized as we were and would have sat up all night just talking about it. It was not Crash or Brokeback Mountain. But what Peter Jackson did to re-create Tolkien's book was and is truly masterful. It has been almost three years since the movie came out and I am still enthralled with it.  If you have not seen it then you should.  If you are hesitating on buying the movie don't it is well worth it.	5.0	What a great movie.	2006-03-19	2	1	1

He screwed the trilogy way up."" Well Im a huge fan of the book, and I love these movies. People never think about just how hard it would be to make the movies exactly like the book and not be 14 hrs. long and really boring. What Peter Jackson has done is brilliance. Basically, some people think that just because the films are not word for word from the book, they are obsolete. If you're a fan of the books, these movies are definately worth checking out. The 2 extra discs are almost as good as the movies. Oh yeah, after you watch the movies a few times, watch the cast commentary. That stuff is the best.Any how, I support Peter Jackson's vision of the Lord of the Rings.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AO2TLXZYQVHB6	Lee Arden	"While it's too early to say that The Return of the King is the greatest film ever made, it would definitely be one of the great films to come out of Hollywood for a long time. It is undeniable that the Peter Jackson trilogy of Lord of the Rings is indeed groundbreaking in ambition and achievement that it is spawning copies from otherwise great directors (Troy, Alexander the Great...) which would probably not measure up to Jackson's work.To his credit, Jackson succeeded in mostly avoiding the cliche and most of his scenes work beautifully and don't come off as fake. Some of the acting, however, does. But I probably notice this because I've seen the films countless times.One strange thing for me is that a moving scene in the movie, one that has Aragorn crowned king of Gondor followed by the crowd bowing to the lowly hobbits, is oddly remisnicent of the Emperor of China, also followed by the crowd, bowing to a lowly subject who saves the kingdom in Disney's Mulan.This extended edition, as in the extended editions of the previous installments, is for fans of the book and the movies for a couple of reasons. One, I can't see a casual viewer able to take hours and hours of trivia about the making of the movie. Second, some visual effects in the new and extended scenes are not as polished as those from the theatrical version, a flaw that is easily overlooked by adoring fans.Nonetheless, the extended edition is a wonderful companion to the theatrical version, adding background info, clarifying an outcome and basically building a stronger connection to the Tolkien text.Though I classify myself as one adoring fan, one thing I would complain about is the over-the-top commercialization that mines fans and audiences to their last cents. Releasing an extended edition is one thing, releasing ""official toys"", trading cards, Making-the-Gollum-statue DVD and the rest of the exclusive paraphernalia is quite another."	5.0	A real labor of love; marketing is a bit shameless	2004-11-16	18	7	11

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1U6B2LDK3BUVU	"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are..."	"I think this is the best of the three installments of Lord of the Rings.  Everything comes to its conclusion in this one, there are great fight scenes and personal scenes as well.There is even some humor in this one.  One moment had me roaring, regarding the competition between Gimli and Legolas to see which would kill more enemies in battle, when Legolas mounts an attacking giant Oliphaunt and takes it down, killing it, and Gimli sullenly and competitively blurts out ""that counts as only one!"".  It's great comic relief, and of course you have to see it to appreciate it because it isn't funny in the telling.There is a lot of emotion between the characters.  Sam in particular is very emotional, and his scenes with Frodo are sure to water your eyes.  Sam comes off as a greater hero than Frodo.  Near the end, when all the characters make an appearance at Frodo's bedside in what appears to be a theatrical final bow, Sam's appearance is the final one, the one reserved for the star.This has to be listed among the greatest movies of all time.  But I refuse to give any movie a rave review without at least mentioning some area for improvement.  I hate rave reviews that have nothing to suggest as an improvement.One thing I would ask is complete faithfulness to the book.  That wasn't done in this series.  A few changes were made.  I wouldn't have made any.It's hard for me to come up with anything else.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable film.  I've already said, in my review of Fellowship of the Ring, that the elves are too tall, leaving the dwarves as the only small race, when Tolkien had the elves probably lighter in weight than the dwarves, and only inches taller.  Gimli was supposed to be stronger than Legolas.  The whole size scale was off quite a bit.  Men were supposed to be significantly larger than elves and orcs.I don't object to the movie leaving out the whole final section about the hobbits returning to the Shire and having to battle Saruman once again.  That would have added a half hour to the film, and it was long enough as is.  But still, it would have been very interesting to see that final chapter, when Merry and the other hobbits became military heroes at home.  It was Merry's only real time to shine, aside from when he helped Eowyn take down the leader of the ringwraiths.I liked their decision to show Gollum as a young hobbit taking the ring from his brother.  I suppose that was more important than showing the returning hobbits retake the Shire from Saruman.  Still, I'm not totally comfortable with leaving out the military heroism of the hobbits vs. Saruman.Another thing I'm sorry to have missed is the story of Tom Bombadil, the most interesting character in the book of all the characters who were left out of the movie.  A true film document of LOTR would have to include Tom Bombadil, an unforgettable character.  He's the oldest character in Middle Earth, and the only one who can actually put on the ring of power without disappearing.  The ring has absolutely no influence on him.  He toys with it early in the book.  He's the one character Sauron never could have subdued, even if Sauron regained the ring and took control of Middle Earth.Now I have to go back and read the books - again.LOTR was written by an Englishman during the darkest years of the 20th Century, inspired by the rise of our own Sauron, Germany's Hitler.  I wonder if it was of hidden significance that in the final battle scenes the eagles make an appearance and take on the ringwraiths.  I wonder if Tolkien saw, in the eagles, the appearance of the USA to take on Hitler's ringwraiths.I see Lord of the Rings as a fantasy version of World War Two, and I think Tolkien did too.  That's when it was written.One last comment.  Frodo failed.  Yet he was still a hero.  I like that.  We all fail.  The fact that Frodo failed to destroy the ring, failed the test that Galadriel and Gandalf passed when they gave up the offer of the ring, really taints him as a hero.  He was a failure.  But still he is appreciated and treated as a hero for the successes he had along the way, despite his ultimate failure when the chips were down.  That's nice to know.  We may mess up in some really big ways, but we can still be appreciated for the things we managed to do right.  It's a comforting thought.  God knows we need someone to cut us some slack in heaven when our lives are reviewed."	5.0	Best of the three LOTR movies	2005-10-01	7	6	1

I had a lot of fun watching it as I haven't read the book in years and I have never seen the movie, so I had forgotten a lot of the details of the plot and got to ""rediscover"" what happens. This one had just the right amount of action and story, and I didn't have as much of the ""I hope this is almost over"" feeling as I did with the first two movies.  As always, it has great characters and an amazing plot and scenery.  The cinematics were phenomenal given that it was made 8? years ago.This is more of a reflection on Tolkein than the movie per se, but I love the strong female characters.  Considering that when he was writing women were still predominantly in traditional roles, I give him a lot of credit for having female characters that actually participate and do something!  I definitely loved the ""show down"" with the Witch King.This was a phenomenal book, and the Director and particularly the visual effects people did an amazing job of bringing the story to life.

It moved me to tears a couple of times. But... (and you knew I was going to say that, didn't you?) but... WHY is my biggest comment/question.Why did Jackson include long, drawn-out scenes of events that never happened in the books, yet omit important pieces of the actual plot? Why did he twist characters into unrecognizable simulations of themselves?Major Spoilers Follow....==========Three and a half hours long, yet Jackson can't bother telling you what happens to Saruman? Or even have Wormtongue toss the Palintir out the window? And WHY make Denethor look like ""a spineless fool"" as one reviewer called him - and that comment right there shows that because of Jackson the general public will now never understand that Denethor wasn't a coward. He wasn't even cruel. He was insane - the Palintir that he found and used was twisted by Sauron, and he went insane. But we never see that. Just gross, disgusting table manners, senseless cruelty to Faramir, and complete inability to defend the White City. Unreal. And completely unbelieveable. And then, to turn him into a cartoon-ish fireball plopping off the top of the city? Why, oh why?And then there were the events at the stairs. Why? Why have Frodo suddenly twisted by Gollum and tell Sam to go home? Because it had ""cinematic value""? As if we needed to have some kind of ""inner bond"" with Frodo and Gollum? Pah-leeze!And then there was the return to the Shire - peaceful, idyllic, lovely. And apparently in a magical stasis field, completely protected from Saruman's evil. But hey, I suppose I could have lived with that, if Jackson had managed to get the scene at the Grey Havens right. Would it have hurt to even once mention that Frodo and Bilbo and Gandalf and the rest were going to the Undying Lands? And to make it the ""last ship"" leaving Middle Earth was ridiculous - when Tolkein was clear that later Sam, Gimli and Legolas also go to the Undying Lands, after the death of Aragorn, many years later.Oh, and Arwen - dying if the Ring isn't destroyed? Did we need that? Bad enough the Sword that Was Broken is reforged and brought to Aragorn by Elrond, apparently just so Elrond and Arwen could show up an extra time or two (unlike Saruman!!) but to add in some kind of magical ""link"" with Arwen and the One Ring? Huh? Is she suddenly the heart and soul of Middle Earth, or something? Excuse me? And hey, while we're talking about Arwen - never mind that she never even thought of leaving Middle Earth and taking ship at the Grey Havens, would it have killed Jackson to include the rest of Aragorn and Arwen's children? I mean, as long as they were going to show the son, why not also show the daughters?And Gandalf - although his little life-after-death speech was rather precious (and not in the book at all!) - why have him lose hope - more than once!?!?! Gandalf did NOT need reassurance from Aragorn to keep on going. At only one moment does he fear Frodo is dead, when the Mouth of Sauron presents the group with Frodo's belongings at the Black Gate (which would have been nice to see!), but it is a brief moment, and Gandalf never actually gives in to despair! Why do that to the character? Does Jackson have some desperate need to ""humanize"" The Enemy of Sauron, the Keeper of the Ring of Fire, sent by the Valar? Apparently so...And finally, Faramir and Eowyn. Yep, there they are side by side at the end. And how did they meet? Do we assume that it's just an accident of crowd management, or do they like each other? Too bad filmgoers unfamiliar with the books will never know the beauty of Eowyn and Faramir's romance. Ah well...Like I said - I liked the film. But in the end, it's a Hollywood adaption written by a scriptwriting team that was more concerned with special effects than the story. Jackson may have ""loved"" the books, but he obviously didn't understand Tolkein's underlying messages, which are virtually lost in the big-budget glitz. This story was never about fantasy and folklore, action and adventure - Tolkien himself was clear that it was a ""very Christian, in fact Catholic tale"". Too bad Jackson never seemed to truly understand that."	2.0	Ohhhh - I wanted SO much to love it....	2006-07-04	30	12	18

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2Z68DD1C4PM0F	lito	"All 3 movies are great.  Although this movie would not have been made so spectacularly at any other time in  motion picture history, what with the availability of the CGIs for use in many present day movies. With that pointed out, the CGIs though are used effectively and it doesnt divert ones attention from the core of the story. The story is heavy with content and I was at an awe as the story progressed.  It is very engaging also because of its emotional insight in regards with its characters, Frodo , Sam & the rest.  Their friendships & loyalties to one another in the task they have to do is there from part one ""The Fellowship"" to the third and concluding installment ""The Return of the King""  And we also wonder about the emotions of Smeagol when he was attracted to the ring the first time he saw it. It affected him so much that he did the ultimate crime. These emotional things are intriguing & adds to the story's appeal. I am reminded of what I read somewhere - or heared it maybe - that a story is good when the villain is so BAAAAD that it puts a sinister shadow over the heroes.  With this movie for instance, the ever present evil hanging over every character's head is there in every scene.  The evil is so represented by a small ring, looking harmless and benign that we maybe take it for granted nowadays because of its size, and, that it is somehow connect with evil represented by a BIG EYE on top of a TOWER so positioned near a VOLCANO so it can guard whoever moves around it. The contrast of it gives the heroes the underdog appeal.  Of course Sauron knows that its this volcano where he & his Ring of Power can be destroyed. A very nicely thought of yarn. The story is strong I think also because of, again the contrast of the BIG and EVIL Sauron and his army of Orcs against the little  heroes, the hobbits, the dwarves the elves and the corruptible humans.  And from the opening shots and narrative in part one we feel they have no chance of defeating this monster of monsters and evil of evils. But they do!!  To best enjoy the Trilogy I suggest them to see it in proper chronology. Thats what I did and in my humble opinion these 3 are the best adventure/fantasy movies I have seen since I started watching movies, and there is no other movie in the past quite like it. Its the BEST!!!, and humbly I say, Ive seen a lot of movies, fantasy and not."	5.0	Superlatives	2004-02-07	1	0	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2EY1LN39D9UC8	lk	Having seen the first two movies on DVD, I have to say that watching the third film in the series, the Return of the King, was probably the most baffling and dissapointing experience in all my years of watching film.First off, whatever contract negotiations that were involved in making the third film animated were just completely wrong headed.  The animated characters look nothing like thier real life counterparts, and Aragorn gets far less screen time then the title would suggest.  Even so, it would have been nice to have the original stars (Ellijah Wood, Ian Mckellen, et al) at least lend thier voices to the characters.  One can only surmise that the Producers of these films thought that audiences would be so wrapped up in the story that they wouldn't care if the final installment was mailed to people on cocktail napkins.And there is also so much that has not paid off in this third installment, not the least of which is:  Where is Arwen?I put the third movie next to the others in my collection, but somehow it doesn't seem to fit.  Maybe I have to watch it a few times more.	1.0	Completely dissapointed	2004-05-28	44	6	38

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1I9B4PSCDDWOO	"lordhoot ""lordhoot"""	The third installment of Lord of the Rings trilogy have turned out to be a pretty exciting and entertaining film. However, the viewers might be divided in their opinions on how good the movie may be. For those who have not read the book, this movie will be their version of the One Ring that Rule them all. For those who have read the book, they may find it slightly disappointed at the choices Peter Jackson (director) made in the story. Now I have read the book I was slightly disappointed by some of the things Jackson did in the movie. (Did Gandalf forgot that he was a wizard?) All the stirring parts of the book was totally ignored but he did make other parts quite exciting and entertaining so I guess it even out. I can lived happily with Jackson's version outside of one part. I thought his treatment of Frodo and Sam was pretty shameful in the end. Here was two hobbits who basically saved Middle Earth from ultimate evil and there was little or almost no real acknowledgement from the Aragon or people of Gondor. Yes, they did all bend their knees to them in one scene but they also honor Pippin and Merry as well, equalizing Pippin and Merry with Frodo and Sam must be considered as an ultimate insult to the latter two hobbits. Jackson should had Frodo carrying the crown of Gondor to Aragon instead of Gimili and  he and Sam should had the higher honor then any other, since their was the most important of all the quests. Aragorn became King only due to Gandalf and Frodo/Sam's effort, they should be honored above all else. Only other major weakness as a film goes, it had to do with the end. Peter Jackson apparently lost his magic as he simply couldn't figured out how to end the movie. The ending dragged on and on and on like some endless poem that should have ended several verses ago. Those who will watch the movie will understand.Of course, I will be looking forward to the extended version of this movie on DVD since the story did suffered from point to point. Only then will there be a true classic in making.	4.0	Very good movie...until the end.	2003-12-17	2	0	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1VVZE8TKPEBX8	Loren Rosson III	"Peter Jackson proved me wrong when I said, like many people, that Lord of the Rings would be a bust: Spielberg-adventure at best, Lucas-disaster at worst. Had I known Tolkien's classic was in the hands of the guy who directed Heavenly Creatures, I would have been more optimistic. As it turns out, my expectations were completely overturned. In some ways the films are actually better than the books, especially in terms of emotional power. Competent actors, amazing cinematography, and a brilliant music score combine to offer us Middle-Earth as we'd never imagined it.Fellowship of the Ring is the most polished film, with its elegant episodic pacing. We start in the idyllic world of the hobbits and flee with Ringwraiths hot on our heels; we rest in Elrond's sanctuary and plunge into Moria; we come out grieving and console ourselves in Galadriel's safe (yet unsettling) dream-wood, and then wind up surrounded by Uruk-hai. This is a quintessential fantasy road-journey containing three episodes within an episode, each beginning in a haven and followed by a dark journey. The pacing is flawless, and the plot unfolds to a perfect beat.Two Towers is the ambiguous film. It's excellent (or at least the extended version is) but structured in a way that the hobbits become sidelined by the Rohan story. As they are the soul of Tolkien's epic, we feel slightly nonplussed at their consignment to B-storylines. Ironically, the film is a showcase for cgi characters Gollum and Treebeard, who manage to steal the show from within these storylines.Return of the King is the most dramatic film, tragic on almost a biblical level, and certainly the most satisfying. I can understand why Elijah Wood calls it ""better than one and two combined"". It centers on the hopeless mission to Mount Doom, which, as every fan knows, is the heart of the story. Around this we're bombarded by apocalyptic chaos and destruction on the Pelennor Fields, followed by Aragorn's hopeless march on the Black Gate. We finish at the Grey Havens, the best ending in literary and cinematic history, which encapsulates all of Tolkien's themes: courage, friendship, suffering, and passing on. It just doesn't get better than this.Peter Jackson deserves more accolades than I'm capable of heaping to the point of overkill. Minor quibbles aside, the extended versions of these films are masterpieces to be treasured as much as the books. Tolkien's classic may be pure, but the movie's cinematography takes us where even the written word cannot go. Tolkien's writing is irreplaceable, but Howard Shore's music taps deeper into Middle-Earth's soul. The text is sacred, but the scriptwriters changed it anyway so that it could actually work on screen. The entire project has been too good to be true, and I'm still in awe of it."	5.0	A miraculous accomplishment	2004-10-20	487	450	37

Our little Hobbit Frodo finally completes his mission to Mordor, but it is his close friend and companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) that steals the show!  Personally, I would have liked to have seen more of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and a little less of majestic horses being thrown about in battle.  The close-up shots and schizoid deceptions of Gollum,  are a tribute to computer animation.  The backgrounds and panaramic scenes were amazing!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1TWTULVD6F22O	"L. Quido ""quidrock"""	"Peter Jackson, the director, of LOTR(bypassed for an Academy Award for the first two parts of the Tolkien trilogy) turns in a magnificent film that is easily the best of the three ""Rings"" films, the best film of the year, and definitely cements the absolute need for the Academy to award him with a Director's Oscar this year.The length of the film and the darkness of the struggle may prove to be too much for some, but the viewer is treated to a visual and audio masterpiece that succeeds in every major way.Others have gone into the list of the cast, and the plotline up to this point, so I should suffice to say that, the company of men, elf, dwarf and hobbits that has set out to destroy a ring that enthralls good men to evil, completes its quest. Much of the movie is aligned into three major subplots. In each, Jackson spends the time it takes to develop bonds between his characters, and not let them get lost at the expense of the scenery and plot.The constant is hobbits Frodo and Sam, with the ring, and accompanied (thanks to CGI wizardry)by the creature Gollum to the land of the dead, Mordor, where the evil Sauron rules and plots to overthrow the kingdoms of elves and men. The film begins with a scene that gives us the origins of Gollum, and helps those watching without story familiarity, to understand the struggle between good and evil that vests in the very nature of Gollum. Somehow, again, in this plotline, Jackson is able to convey, through the camera and careful direction, a palpable hunger between anyone who comes in contact with the Ring, and the Ring itself.This plotline continues throughout the entire film, and the bleak landscape and feeling of dread follow the three throughout. I was especially impressed by the CGI of the creature ""She"", especially in her capture of Frodo. Frodo and Sam's relationship has to withstand many tests, but I found the most telling moment between them occurred after they were in safety, as Frodo awakes, and greets his friends one by one. As Sam enters the room, the look between them is everything - a true measure of friendship without words, as only two people who've been to hell and back can express their bond.Gandalf stays, for the most part, with the main plot, an attack on the men of Gondor, at their stronghold, Minis Tirith. Words cannot do justice to the special effects and camerawork used to film Minis Tirith from a distance, and to film the action sequences, with a cast of hundreds and hundreds, within the walls. Surpassing the battle for Helm's Deep in film 2, one of the most poignant moments at Minis Tirith is when its prince, Faramir, is sent by his father, the city's steward Denethor, out to meet the insurgents with a small company, facing certain death. In this scene, Jackson gives us the faces of hopelessness in the city's women and children. The small sublplot between Denethor and Faramir, and the Gandalf's anger at Denethor, is one of those rich textures that Jackson didn't leave out of the film to cut its running time. Bravo!Jackson gives us a real bond that Tolkien did not emphasize between the hobbit Pippen and Gandalf. They start out at odds, but the hobbit grows in stature with Gandalf, in the way he conducts himself in the city.Merry, Pippen's usual sidekick, is left behind with Aragorn, the future king, Legolas the Elf and Gimli the dwarf. Merry proves his mettle in learning to fight with Eowen, princess of the Rohan. Aragorn and the rest of his small company make a trip into the land of the dead -- raising an army there is a special effects triumph.In the battle scene for Minis Tirith, spectacle is displaced by even greater spectacle. Mordor's army is menacing and huge, with catapaults and several varieties of terrible creatures we've come to label as ""Orcs"". Severed heads of Gondor's slain soldiers are used to frighten those within the city. Reconnaissance for the army is in the form of the dreadful and amazing fell beasts(flying dragons), with the chief rider (the faceless creature Nazgul) one of the truly frightening beings on the screen. When the riders of Rodan arrive, the incredible spectacle of their charge, and their willingness to lay it all on the line for the future of mankind, is palpable. The impact of their forces attacking the Orc army is almost too terrible to behold.Only Miranda Otto (as Eowyn, Princess of the Rohan), of the women in the film, is given a lion's sized role. Her scene defending her father, with Merry's help, on the battlefield, is amazing. The effects used to have her attack the Fell Beast and the Nazgul, are without peer.Finally, the marauding of the mercenaries who join Mordor, using stealthy ships and attacking with perhaps the best CGI effects in the film, in the form of the the marauding ""oliphaunts"", slain in creative ways.Viggo Mortenson, as Aragorn, becomes truly ""kingly"" in this adventure. His speeches to the troops are truly stirring, and he is the epitome of what Tolkien had in mind for his king in the movie's end.Lastly, Annie Lennox's haunting melody during the credits wraps up what is truly a magical movie experience. I much like the expression one of the other reviewers used here---for 3 hours, this film truly made me forget ""I have a life"".Majestic and wonderful...gotta see the Imax version."	5.0	Magnificent!	2004-01-13	12	10	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	The Return of the King is the best installment of Peter Jackson's extraordinary adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkein's trilogy.  It has all of the high points of the first two films, but few of their problems.  Sure, it's long.  But unlike Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers, there's little chance of falling asleep in this one.  Return of the King grabs you quickly, with a gruesome opening scene (certainly PG-13 stuff, if not R), and pulls you into plot threads that wind and weave with just the right balance of each, building incredible power and momentum along the way.  Indeed, the greatest achievement of this film is its story orchestration, creating a symphony out of what could have been a chaotic mess.No review of Return of the King would be complete without mentioning the special effects.  Never have effects been used so well.  Never.  Jackson and his team have created an amazing fantasy world, against the exotic backdrops of New Zealand, that so far surpasses any other film (including the first two films in this series) as to impress even the most dulled senses.  And the realization of Gollum in this film borders on perfection.  The scene where Gollum talks to his own rippling reflection is mind-boggling.The acting is fine.  Ian McKellen's mumbling is by and large not in evidence (thankfully), but Elijah Woods small collection of facial expressions started wearing thin after a time.  The rest of the case is in fine form, but without any real stand-outs.If not for it's length, I might be tempted to see this film several times.  At my age, though, three hours and twenty minutes is too much to repeat.	4.0	Yes, it's very, very good.  But calm down.	2003-12-20	7	1	6

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ALNL3YW7AS1NX	Malus Caelestis	"Don't get me wrong or take the wrong idea from my rating, it's a very good movie indeed.  The special effects are eye candy and the climax of Sauron's fall is satisfying in its payoff.  It has a little something for everyone -- large scale battles, humorous deaths, monsters, romance, etc.  Having never read any of the books, I was pleased with the overall trilogy.  However...I find it very irritating, unnerving and unacceptible that Saruman's final scene in this movie was CUT.  Yes, CUT.  All you are treated to is a miniscule explanation of all of maybe two sentences, and then he disappears from the entire plot.  Ridiculous to the point of stupidity.  It is a simpering, stupid move by Jackson to build up this villain as a major threat to the Fellowship in the first two movies, then just drop anything involving him in the conclusion to the triloy.  It would be like Legolas (sorry all you teenybopper fans, I had to pick on someone) suddenly not appearing anywhere in the third film and their only in-story explanation is, ""He couldn't come with us.""  You know how many people would be rioting over that?  That's how I feel about Saruman's end being cut.  The audience is left with absolutely no payoff or feeling of retribution against the villain second to none but Sauron.  This villain climatically betrayed Gandalf and nearly killed him, but favored torturing him instead.  He created a massive army of Uruk-Hai that marked the eventual death of Boromir and the attack on Helms Deep.  He forced the Fellowship through Khazad-dm which marked the battle between Gandalf and the Balrog, consequently exiting Gandalf out the plot for the rest of the first installment of the trilogy.  That, plus possessing Theoden... How can you not keep this character's finale in the final version of the movie?  I don't care if it'll be released on the Extended DVD, it belonged in the theatrical version.  From what I have researched, the scene was seven minutes long.  Seven minutes.  You mean to tell me they couldn't have cut out some of the rehashed, useless dialogue echoed from ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""Two Towers""?  I fail to believe that.For that reason, I deduct two stars from this movie for the blatant disregard of one of the more interesting villains of the saga.  For shame."	3.0	A very good movie...	2003-12-19	23	11	12

But I wanted to get my own notes down while the film was fresh in my mind.  Most of these have to do with what makes this series such a great success, even though it has a few glaring flaws.One has to keep in mind that Peter Jackson's intent was not to create a perfect duplicate of Tolkein's sweeping story, but to capture its essence and recreate the effect the Ring has when we first encountered the books.  Especially for those viewers who had never read the books in the first place.  I believe he has done exactly that.  For me, who has read the story some seven times, this film and its predecessors create the same excitement I felt on my first encounters when LOTR was still a fresh story.  In the process of doing so, Jackson has rearranged and glossed the story, something I suspect is unavoidable in an undertaking many would have thought was completely impossible.One thing Jack does extraordinarily well is recreate the scenes which first appeared in my mind's eye.  Not once during the film did I suddenly get brought up cold and say &quot;that's not the way it really looked.&quot;  This is no mean achievement when Jackson's task isn't to just please me, but to create images that will work for the millions of minds that were Tolkein fans long before filming it was anthing more than a twinkling in somebody's eye.  Certainly, for me, Jackson has managed to crystallize some visions that were previously only fuzzy.  With the exception of one or two of the actors.This last challenge, the acting, is probably the worst that a director could face.  Everyone has their own internal images of how each character looked and sounded.  Jackson's task - to find a happy compromise between all of our visions - really is an impossible one.  So for the most part he has used the approach of providing neutral performances upon which each of us can hang our personal baggage and feel at home.  Some performances, such as Ian Mckellan's are nearly perfect, because Gandalf is such a known quantity.  But Liv Tyler as Arwen is a bit too subdued for my tastes.  But she succeeds by not overly jarring my own thoughts about Arwen.  Thus, while some of the acting is borderline from one viewpoint or another, nothing is jarringly out of place.Thus, by combining a miracle display of special effects and creative design with a cast which is always within believable parameters, each viewer can find his or her 'Ring' and carry away the satisfaction of having seen a fantasy recreated.	5.0	In My Mind's Eye	2003-12-25	10	9	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3E2UGCDGIC7UL	Marcus Aurelius	I've been in love with the Lord of the Rings books for over 10 years. That's half my life. In the first year alone I read the trilogy five times, and steadily afterwards.Anyway, I was excited beyond reason at the prospect of a movie series. I had VERY high hopes. The first wasn't all I had hoped for, but great nonetheless. The second was DAMN good and the third incredible. I would have to say it's my new favourite movie.Such a solidly crafted work of art, incredible imagery, detailed attention to the original story line. I found myself repeating the very words they would use on screen in my head before they were even uttered.The war scenes were something else. I've never been more impressed. I found myself utterly entranced. My whole heart and mind in the world of middle earth. This world will forever remain with me. 10+ stars!Good job All who made these films a reality! I was lucky enough to catch a glimpse of the stars and director at the European Premiere in Berlin. Many guests were invited. All the others strutting down the red carpet full of themselves while the Lord of the Rings cast were the opposite; friendly and humble. They really are such special people.I want more!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1J6W0GJ9HQTBM	Marinergirl	How do I love this movie, let me count the ways! I wish I was a more articulate person so I could more adequately express the genius of this movie, but I'm not so here goes my best shot:Two Towers was a bit of a let-down (not huge, but slightly) after the very moving Fellowship of the Rings. I heard through cast interviews that the third movie would be the best, but was skeptical at the scenes of what looked like basically a mideval battle with not much fantasy weaved in. But the movie took my breath away. It was so moving, so heart-pumping. Tolkien was a genius with character development, especially with Frodo heading toward demise but still struggling to maintain some sense of right and wrong. With Aragorn, the reluctant king realizing what he has to do by taking the throne, with the self-sacrifice of King Theoden, with the courage of Merry and Pippin, and of course, the unrelenting loyalty Sam showed by picking up his best friend and carrying him up the side of the mountain. Looking back, Sam had been probably the strongest character through the first two movies, but in the third he really broke through and stole the show and moved audiences to tears with his display of friendship.Some say the movie carried on too far but it was not long enough in my opinion which is why I am so thrilled for the extended edition to come out. The last time I saw the movie was in April and I vowed not to watch it again until the extended version came out so as not to see it too much and take away some of the magic. So now I am obviously bursting with anticipation. It is my favorite movie and I'm pretty sure the extended edition will only make it better. I can't wait for December 14!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A16SS8HYJW7IEJ	"Mark Pollock ""educator"""	"Well, we waited long enough, and now we have the last ""Extended Edition"". Seeing that there are already 300+ reviews on this so far, I'm not sure what I can add, but here goes.First of all, if you already like the movie, then you will like this edition too. There are a couple of head-scratching moments when scenes are changed from day to night, and this is problematic, because such moments really remove the viewer from the ""film experience"", that is, you start watching whats happening in the film instead of being immersed in it.I'm not going to go into any ""This actor is great, this actor is terrible"" commentary. I assume people are capable of forming their own opinions!The picture quality is superb, up to the quality of the previous volumes. This is quite an accomplishment, considering that there is even MORE material than on the previous two extended editions!4 hours and 10 minutes is a LOT of movie. Good grief.The sound quality is superb. If you are so lucky as to have a DTS 6.1 receiver that uses the discrete back channel, there's lot to show off with.I can live with a lot of revisions to the story, I don't mind the loss of Tom Bombadil and others, but losing the scouring of the Shire is just too much. The added scene with Saruman and Wormtongue was implausible, without motivation, and really useless, IMO. It did not improve the film for me. (For those of you who haven't read the books and who wonder why there is so much whining about this, it's because the scouring of the Shire is the wonderful ending, where the four hobbits show how much their travels have changed them.)The added scenes with the dead army were great. Best added scenes yet.The special features are always well done and tasteful. Whoever is editing these together has watched the Star Wars dvds and realized that calling the director a genius every 5 seconds is no way to make a documentary. Rather, the focus is on the hard work and dedication of all the people involved.I'll say it again - why bother putting art and photo galleries on a dvd? Who can actually see any details?Packaging is nice and sturdy, and the disc holders have improved.All in all, a package that will not disappoint. If you enjoyed these movies, then you pretty much need this. If you haven't seen any of them, you probably should rent them first."	5.0	Yet another review	2004-12-24	4	4	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2DAHERP7HYJGO	Mark Turner	Fans of film and fantasy have had the pleasure of seeing one of the all time classic tales brought forth from the page to the screen. The story of first Bilbo and then Frodo Baggins has captured the imagination of readers for years now. But the translation to screen was slow in coming. An animated version directed by Ralph Bakshi came out in the seventies and was not adopted by the fans. Until Peter Jackson took the bull by the reigns and turned this unfilmable project into the mega success it was, it looked like all hope was lost.And now, the final chapter in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy arrives. The wait was more than worth it. The story of a ring of power that had to be destroyed started with THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, where a group of beings from Middle Earth joined together to accomplish this task. THE TWO TOWERS took us further down that same journey, featuring the tremendous battle of Helm's Deep. THE RETURN OF THE KING takes what was best of both previous films and pulls it all together.The story picks up with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) still making the dangerous trek to Mordor in an attempt to destroy the ring of power and save Middle Earth. Still in their company is Gollum (Andy Sirkis), longing to possess the ring once more and plotting against the pair as they near their destination.The other members of the Fellowship have now reached the fallen tower of Saruman The White (Christopher Lee) and found Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). In counsel with Theoden (Bernard Hill), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellan) and Aragorn (Vigo Mortensen) warn of the coming danger. Finding an orb that connects Merry to the evil Sauron, Gandalf and Merry travel to Minas Trith to warn of the danger and organize an army to protect the rest of Middle Earth from the oncoming attacks of Sauron and his legions of orcs. Instead they find the steward of Minas Trith refusing to surrender the throne to the true king, Aragorn.The rest of the Fellowship wait for a sign from Minas Trith which comes but perhaps too late as the legions of Sauron are upon them. As they prepare for battle, Aragorn leaves them in an attempt to round up more warriors since they are currently outnumbered. The ghosts of fallen defenders of the crown are called upon to pay off the oath they took to do so.All of the pieces are placed on the board and we watch as the battle of Minas Trith begins. It is an amazing sight to see as creatures that cannot exist ridden by other creatures that cannot be attack. Flying dragons ridden by frightful leaders, orcs in battle gear raging against the walls of Minas Trith and mobile towers set to allow easy access to the walled city are brought forth and made believable.All the while, Frodo, Sam and Gollum are nearing the dark lands. The treachery of Gollum is seen by Sam but Frodo continues to defend him, putting the trio at peril. It isn't until near the films end that what it intends for Frodo is revealed.All of these stories meld into one another easily, creating a tale that is not near as complicated to follow as one would think. The storytelling done here makes it seem real, pulls the viewer into the action and makes you care about each and every character. Even side characters are developed enough that you worry about the outcome of each one.To reveal the end would be more than just offering a spoiler to readers. The fact is that not everyone comes home by films end. Heroes are revealed, romances are fulfilled and the journey DOES end, sad but true. And it does so with style.While the two previous films have been overlooked at award ceremonies, to do so now would simply be spiteful in the face of its success. This movie delivers what all have waited for and expected.As I watched form beginning to end, I felt the same feeling that came over me as I watched the earlier films. We live in a world where heroes are torn down on a daily basis. The good deeds done by those we were brought up to respect are overlooked in an effort by one group or another trying to push forth their own agenda by making them look bad. Take Thomas Jefferson for example. All of his accomplishments have been overlooked in favor of his having a slave as a mistress. This is how we treat heroes today.But not in fiction, or at least some of it. The lessons of life, the unwanted but sometimes unavoidable task at hand of going to battle, sacrificing oneself for the good of the rest, attempting to actually achieve something without the playing field made level, all of these are depicted in this story. Admiration for these characters, people who find their destinies linked, who have to do all that they can to save their way of life, is felt from the first frame to the last.Epic films of the past have marveled audiences for decades. The chariot race from BEN-HUR, the desert sands from LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the demolition of the bridge in BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, have been used to mark film history in both quality and esteem. It is time that these films received the recognition that they deserve as well.In my 50 years on Earth, I have seen tons of movies. Rarely have I had the chance to see a movie, no a series of movies, that have captured my imagination so well. No time have I seen a series of films (including STAR WARS) that have made me long for the next chapter. These movies are made to be seen on a big screen. Thank goodness big screen TVs have arrived in the nick of time.	5.0	KING IS A BEFITTING TITLE	2008-03-15	1	1	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AXLXU4LMIRO3F	MartialWay	Once again I see a film with a 5 star customer rating at Amazon. Once again I look for the few bad reviews to see why some people didn&#65533;t like it. Yeah, I read the books, so? I had to for High School creative writing. I did it for a grade, and fought to get through every single line. That was when I was a kid, and had more pressing matters, like this chick named Alexis in my Econ class. Woah baby! As an adult, however,  I appreciate them for the masterpieces that they are&#65533; but I have my reservations.I couldn&#65533;t stand the flowery language these people used. That will no doubt get a few &#65533;no help&#65533; clicks on this review. HAH! But be honest, the dialogue in the books read well but probably wouldn&#65533;t sound too good to modern ears when spoken aloud. I&#65533;m glad they changed so much of it, and stuck to what was important. Tom Bombadil was useless, so was his blue jacket and pretty yellow boots, so stop crowing about his absence!So here&#65533;s the deal. Idiots giving Return of the King less than 4 stars read the books, and are now denouncing the movies simply for not being the books. &#65533;Bite me&#65533;, says I. Go roll a 20 sided die (or 2d10), and see if anyone cares. Those people missed their &#65533;saving throw&#65533; versus &#65533;stupid&#65533;! P.J. knew what he was doing, and knew that most people would roll their eyes if he presented a direct adaptation of the literature and expect people to sit through it.The books were boring, probably to most of the world. Too much is too much. Orcs singing, all the wonderful poetry and exquisite use of the English language while really cool in a book, simply sounds stupid coming out of someone&#65533;s mouth in this day and age. Using what was useful from the books and rejecting what was useless, knowing that he was going to ruffle a few Tolkien fan&#65533;s feathers was a smart move, for there are more movie buffs who couldn&#65533;t care less than there are Tolkien Fans who do. Many Tolkien fans I have learned, loved all three of these movies. So what he gained was acclaim from people who pay at the movies to see movies, not to have a book recited back to them&#65533;get the unabridged audio book for that, man! I&#65533;m tired of all the bookworms bitching&#65533;and they&#65533;re doing most of it in Elvish, so I can&#65533;t understand them anyway.As for Return of the King, on the screen, this movie was astounding. It was fast paced and tense. It was far more action packed than either of the two movies before it, and while the ending could have been shorter I can say nothing bad about it. The battles were believable the winged dragon things were great and Shelob nearly scared me out of the theater.People can look at digital effects and see digital effects&#65533;others use their minds and imaginations and see art, and beautiful scenery and allow themselves to be entertained. A one-star fool here actually suggested they should&#65533;ve used a &#65533;real&#65533; actor for Gollum instead of CGI. Hey dipstick, they DID use a real actor and they painted the cgi over him, as if it were makeup. If you want to see creatures that aren&#65533;t human, but look human watch Star Trek and leave good character development to the experts. Chump.There was so much to take in; I know I&#65533;m going to see it again. And when the DVD comes out I&#65533;m going to buy it. And when the extended addition DVD comes out, I&#65533;m going to buy that also! The last trilogy I saw that made the kind of impact LOTR made started when I was 2  years old and ended when I was 10. It was the Star Wars trilogy.The Matrix came close. It started good but sunk like a stone. The three LOTR films are hopefully the sign of the times, that finally a story as vivid as ones imagination can be shown in a cinema. Click on how this didn&#65533;t help you, haters and nay-sayers! There seem to be plenty of people who don&#65533;t need my help to recognize brilliant filmmaking when they see it.	5.0	Better that the books-- That's right, I said it-- BETTER!	2003-12-19	9	5	4
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AAY1YLTKK4JC7	"Martin Andrade ""Media Gurgitator"""	"Taken together, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is perhaps the greatest cinematic effort ever put forth.  This movie rivals Ben Hur in scope and Metropolis in vision.  Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't without some flaws.  At times the editing is choppy, the ending after the climatic battle is long and drawn out, and at times the movies isn't completely faithful to the book.  Or so I'm told.  I've not actually read the LOTR trilogy by Tolkien.  Having not read the trilogy, maybe I'm at a disadvantage here.  I don't think so, however.  Film and books are completely different arts, just like how a painting and a sculpture are different.  Just try to put Michelangelo's ""david"" as a flat charcoal drawing and you can start to see what I mean.  As a film, this movie is one of the greatest ever produced.From what I understand of Tolkien's writing, he was trying to write a modern epic mythology.  What this means for film is lots of stuff like unreal creatures, magic, and the rest.  Those things are hard to do.  It's even harder to do them well.  Just look at the Movie ""Hulk"" where a bright neon green ball bounced back and forth in sunlight.  Not believable at all.  However, in LOTR:ROTK the cgi was incredible.  Gollum, the strange creature that accompanies Frodo and Sam to Mordor is scarily real.  The battle sequences, the magic and the sets, all incredible.The acting is certainly above average.  All the actors have a Shakespearean sense, and at times the accent plus the delivery makes some of the dialogue difficult for American ears.  I personally think this is a good thing, maybe LOTR will encourage people to quit destroying the English language and maybe even get to a showing of ""Hamlet."" The most comfortable dialogue is between the Dwarf and Legolas, the Elf.  In fact, the best lines of the movie are between those two.I wish I had a better knowledge of the characters and scenes, and it's hard to know the actors when you hardly know the characters.  But, Liv Taylor, gorgeous.  Don't fret if you're someone who knows and loves the book, about whether or not the movie was ""true"" to the book.  On the way out of the theatre, I overheard someone ask ""so was it true to the book?"" ""no"" came the answer, followed by ""It was still awesome.""  That's the best I can think of too, this movie is ""awesome."""	5.0	My words cannot do this movie justice	2003-12-23	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2A17LRHKN464Q	"Martin P. Vaughan ""Helm Hammerhand"""	"I was finally able to watch my ROTK EE last evening and I have to say many of the new scenes are great.  I love the scenes added that are closer to the book such as the houses of healing and the prose from Legolas before the paths of the dead which closely mirror Tolkein's writing.  But I have to say some of the new scenes are cringe-worthy, mainly having to do with Gimli.  I just loved Gimli in the books, his person was one of bravery and honor, and much pride.  I am so upset that Jackson has relegated him to almost constant silly comic relief.  Jackson assumes that his audience can't handle the dread, despair, and fear that Tolkien instilled in his fellowship in the books.  Yes they still had hope, but they struggled with fear and doubt knowing what awaited them. SPOILERS AHEAD!!In the books as Gimli went into the paths of the dead he was struck with such fear (and of course it was total darkness in the cave, I understand this would not relate to film) that he was crawling on his hands and knees in absolute terror, yet he wen't in because in the end he was honorable and brave and a true friend of the fellowship.  This scene in the books was so terrifying, yet in the film Jackson mainly makes it a comedy.  Gimli blowing at the spirits as if they are candles is such a lame way to film this scene.  His tap dance on the skulls is ridiculous. The drinking game was another scene where I was sitting there saying ""you have to be kidding me, this is not lord of the rings.  Gimli passes gas, goes cross-eyed and falls out of his bench backwards as his feet sprawl in the air----what?  This is not the Gimli I know. I can handle a few off key laughs as much as the next person, I just can't stand this slapstick routine that insults our intelligence(not to mention poor Gimli's mangled character in these films).I wish I could delete the forced comedy in these movies myself.  Jackson still did a great job with the trilogy, because the scenes that are good (most of them) are so very very good as to cover a multitude of ones that are not.  And did you notice that the most beautiful scenes and the most beautiful dialog are straight from Tolkien's book.  Peter Jackson is great with action and emotion, but the comedy schtick has got to go.  Like I said I can understand some comedy and laughs in a time of peril if it is used in context of the characters trying to alleviate their fears, but some of these scenes are just too silly and take you out of the moments that Tolkien implied for you to feel.Even still four stars because the strong points of these films are very strong.  I love these films, but I love more what they could have been had they not strayed from the formula laid down by Tolkien."	4.0	Love the serious moments, hate the comic relief.	2004-12-17	6	4	2

Well LOTR trilogy is pretty good and I have the other two and was missing this one. The story is good as well as most of the action sequences but this one tends to go on and on and the final battle at the black gate of Murdor is a bit anti climatic after all we have seen in the previous films. An example in this film is Frodo's scenes with the spider which seemed to just go on and on taking away from the battle of Gondor. Anyway thats my two cents if your a fan you've got to get all three films, however for my money the Two Towers is by far the best film out of the three.	3.0	the third but not the best in the series	2012-01-10	1	0	1

This is the 3rd movie in the LOR trilogy, and it doesn't disappoint--especially if you enjoy intense battle scenes, suspense, and a great story line.We loved the ease of renting from Amazon.com directly from our smart TV.  The movie was immediately available for us to watch.  It was very convenient not having to go out to the video store to rent it & then return it....and the best part was the picture was perfect.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A13TO1ZFAH9SVN	Matthew Edmundson	The Return of the King was a fantastic movie. Peter Jackson made a modern masterpiece with it. The other two movies are just as good as the first. One thing Peter Jackson does is when he makes a Special Edition DVD he goes all out and that's what has me so excited about this movie.50 minutes of footage will be added to the movie. I can tell you from my experience with the first two special editions is that the footage will be great. It always adds more to the movie and explains a little more of Tolkiens books. It will make the movie four hours long, but who cares. It will be some of the best four hours of your cinematic life everytime you watch it.The Howard Shore score also has me excited. This guy is an excellent composer. He is no John Williams or James Horner, but he is quickly apporaching there status.I love the extras that Jackson puts with these Special Editions. The first two had over four hours of extras talking about the movies and there makings and it's incredible how these were put together. I look forward to watching all the Appendices on Return of the King and seeing how one of the greatest special effect movies ever made was made.The interviews with all the actors are always great on these DVDs. These guys became these characters and like family to each other. It's great hearing there stories and the love that they had for each other and for the project. If all movies had the commitment from their actors like the Lord of the Rings did, we'd see a lot more better movies.I'm so excited to see this coming out. This is one of the greatest movies ever made and the DVD will be too.	5.0	One of the most anticipated DVD's EVER..And it should be!!	2004-11-04	24	20	4

Bonarek ""drakontas_04"""	"It really irritates me when Amazon combines reviews for a particular title, regardless of the many mediums it's available in.This review is for the 5 disc extended edition blu-ray set for the third film. Not the trilogy blu-ray set, in case this somehow ends up on that page as well. This review will be posted for all three films since most of what I'm going to say pertains to all of them, but any film-specific information will be kept to that respective film. Once I've found 37 hours to have some friends over for a marathon I'll return and give my opinion of the upgraded format. For now this is just a review of the packaging and other things I noticed that might impact someones decision to buy or not.I ordered these separate extended sets because I had read many reviews for the extended trilogy blu-ray set saying 'the Fellowship' has a green (I think it was green) hue prevalent throughout. I did read one review saying the issue could be resolved with some TV adjustments. Beyond that inconvenience I was hoping two things would be different with these sets: first I thought maybe the green issue would be fixed (I'll let you know if that's the case in my update for 'fellowship'), and second I was thinking maybe a more understandable reason for a re-release would be to make all 5 discs (15 between three films) blu-ray. This is not the case. That was the first thing I checked and all the non-feature discs say DVD, while the two discs for the main feature say blu-ray.To sum up, I am happy I bought these sets if only for the beautiful cover art on each. If you don't care about the cover art, if you're not worried about having 15 blu-ray discs total, and if the possibility of a green-less 'fellowship' isn't a big deal, then it probably doesn't matter if you buy these sets or the whole trilogy blu-ray set.I'll update hopefully soon with info on the films themselves.Update:So I've finally watched the film since purchasing and I want to give my thoughts as I did with ""Fellowship"". I really can't say much. The movie looks great, but it looked great in 2003 also. I feel like the images are crisper and colors more vivid, but without a side-by-side comparison it's hard to tell. Snobs might complain but they're just wanting to be heard when they do.Enjoy. :)"	4.0	Review of extended edition 5-disc blu-ray set	2012-09-06	1	1	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2YJ9DT9YZ0DUN	Matthew K. Minerd	The extended edition of The Return of the King does as its predecessors and gives a new level of flow to an already wonderful movie.  The Return of the King is a masterpiece in adapted storyline writing.  Since it is adapted, it has its shortcomings when compared to J.R.R. Tolkien's grand epic.  Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind that this work is primarily an adaptation according to the minds of Peter Jackson et al.Firstly, I would like to address the issues that are often expressed by fans about the changes made by Jackson.  They are indeed more evident in the extended edition (by its temporally longer nature).  Indeed, I must admit that it disappoints me that the writers thought their own ideas were more suitable than those of J.R.R. Tolkien.  Nevertheless, since this is their adaptation and they are movie writers, they made the choices they deemed necessary to convey the story to the movie-going public.  Since they didn't destroy huge portions of the story, I will let it be even though I do not believe that they needed to change all that they did.With that having been said, this massive project is one of the most emotionally stirring movies that I have ever seen.  It is a testimony to the work done by the entire cast and crew that I was nearly in tears not only when the Hobbits are honored in the end by Aragorn but even when the Rohirrim rode into battle.  Watching the movie is more like experiencing one long chill of anticipation and awe, even though I have read The Lord of the Rings multiple times.Because of the added footage, the movie flows better than the original theatrical version.  Surprisingly enough, the near four-and-a-half hours of footage seem no longer than the original three-and-a-half.  Furthermore, the Extended Edition offers the same caliber of special features that were part of the first two Extended Editions for Lord of the Rings.  These documentaries are grand expositions of the work done by the phenomenal crew and cast as they worked to realize this dream.I indeed suggest this movie for all who have experienced the first two installments of The Lord of the Rings.  For those who have not done such, I suggest seeing them all because they are truly the movie masterpieces of our time.  The Return of the King is the gem in the crown for the work done by all involved with the Lord of the Rings project.	5.0	A Masterful Achievement in Movie Making	2005-03-12	2	2	0

I loved how some parts of the movie sort of gave you the shivers when the stars finished speaking their words of wisdom to the troops if you know what I mean.One thing I didn't like was that the battles seemed a bit rushed. For example, in Two Towers, The Battle of Helm's Deep really seemed like a HUGE battle and it really sort of, put you there if you know what I mean. It was very well done and I loved all aspects of that battle, the preparing, the elves, the men thinking that they will not live out the night. It's all good.

Scenes with science fiction or fantasy characters so convincing that I'd have to dissect each shot meticulously.  The ED-209 scene from Robocop or the Darkness scene with Tim Curry from Legend both being examples where a blend of brilliantly scripted dialogue and great characterisation combined with beautifully executed special effects created emotive and convincing characters.The LOTR trilogy is littered with such magic but the platinum extended edition of Return of the King has a new character in a new scene that had me repeatedly watching frame by frame over and over just like back in the top-loader VCR days.The new scene with ""The Mouth of Sauron"" makes this box set worth the price alone. A tense, brilliantly scripted bit of dialogue with a great performance by Bruce Spence, bundled into one of the best pieces of film character design and subtle use of digital effects on ""The Mouth"" itself helps this version of the film shine.I'm going to watch it again...."	5.0	Now with one of the best characters I've ever seen...	2005-01-01	3	1	2

I saw all three movies and thought it was way too long!  Too many cgi shots!  The battle scenes was already done in the second movie.  There isn't a lot of character development at all.  Did anyone notice that none of the main characters ever got hurt?  Not even a scratch in all the battle scenes?  To my mind, this movie cannot stand on its own without the first two movies.  A movie that is the best movie of all time should be able to do so.  This wasn't the best movie of the year.  That honor and the oscar should have gone to Mystic River.  If memory serves me right, it also won an oscar for best editing.  If this is right, then that is a laugh.  Check the ever ending ending as an example why I say this.  Star Wars 4 should have been the first special effects movie to win the best picture oscar. That movie is so much better.  That said, I did enjoy it, but not to the degree that everybody else is.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A33Y4B8N0RS1IB	M. B. Spry	If you haven't seen the extended version of the Return Of The King and liked the original theatrical edition, you owe it to yourself to view this new offering.  The 50+ additional minutes raise the film to a whole new level.  While a few of the additions are perhaps superfluous, the vast majority provide a richer texture to the movie and fill in a lot of gaps.  The battle at the Black Gate is far, far more satisfying in this presentation.  Yeah, the whole movie is long, but I never tired of it; it's breathtaking beauty and spectacle swept me away.  I really enjoyed discovering the additional material.Having watched all of the documentaries, I must say that I found them as entertaining as the film itself--but then I'm always curious about how things are done.  Probably the best aspect of these features is that they show you the uncanny human dedication, passion, and mutual regard that breathed magic into this incredible achievement.  At the end, when all of the principals are saying goodbye to one another, you really sense their ambivalent emotions.  It is drama in itself.I cannot recommend this collection of DVD's highly enough.  Furthermore, if you don't have all three films in their extended formats, get them!	5.0	The most spectacular film ever!	2004-12-30	4	2	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AFJCOP0GKZH6C	M. B. Trapp	All three Lord of the Rings movies were released with extra footage on the Extended Edition DVDs, but I think Return of the King benefited most. The theatrical cut won eleven Academy Awards, but was still forced to cut important elements of Tolkien's novel.  Here we see the final reckoning with Saruman, the parley with the Mouth of Sauron, and sacking of the Corsair ships by the dead army. At almost four hours, it's not for the casual moviegoer, but for Tolkien-heads like me it's perfect.	5.0	I love u PJ!!!!!!	2005-02-19	1	1	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AESY8NCX6VS6O	M. Burns	"It goes without saying that I have not been a huge fan of the LOTR series at all. The first film is corny and overdrawn, and most of The Two Towers suffers from what many middle sections of 2-hour movies do - the 2nd act drag. Only at the end of The Two Towers do Frodo and Sam and the gang really feel like they're becoming fleshed-out characters and not just action figures charging a castle wall. If you look closely at the end of Towers, it's Sam's speech to Frodo about the possibility of them becoming legends that the movie begins to whisper of what's to come, and what has come to pass in The Return of the King is...well...astounding. I tell you, reader, if you're not terribly fond of The Lord of the Rings, it is the compelling, deeply-moving final film that shows of what director Peter Jackson is truly capable.Actor Andy Serkis's Gollum has been a joy to watch ever since he appeared on screen in Towers, even despite constant ribbing by Saturday Night Live and the fact that, yeah, he does sound a little silly when he menacingly screeches ""My preciousssssssss!"" every few minutes. The Return of the King takes a moment to bring additional depth and meaning to Gollum's character by showing his first discovery of the ring even before ""The Return of the King"" logo graces the screen. Luckily, Gollum is not the only character in the film that is made into a living, breathing, three-dimensional being and not a comic book caricature. The whole film seems to take on a lush, heavy air of true dramatic consequence that seemed to be holding back before.Frodo and Sam are ever-so-closer to reaching Mordor; Aragorn is coming ever-so-closer to his destiny as, well, look at the title; and (in the most inspiringly great plot move of the film) Merry, Pippin, and Eowyn show their capacity for uncanny acts of heroism they've had in them all along. In addition, Gandalf kicks more Middle Earth butt like he was born to do while protecting Pippin (who is thought to have the ring), and the time for the final battle for the Middle Earth comes nearer by the minute. It seems like a lot is going on, but this third film is remarkably the easiest to follow and also the most accessible. The third film also has a few huge advantages that work in its favor: (1) it actually has an end (and what an ending!), (2) the characters have had more than 6 screen hours to develop, so they're at their peaks here, and (3) the tension leading to that do-it-or-die moment is worth two years of waiting. It's more obvious than ever by King that all three movies are just one big movie chopped into three parts, but that means that this is the equivalent of a no-holds-barred, all-the-stops-out, slam-bang finale of a 2-hour movie -- and that's exactly what it feels like.The Battle of Helm's deep looks like nothing compared to the steadily-climaxing action of The Return of the King. Unlike some of the scenes in the first two films, the action seems to have a purpose here, and this reviewer will admit - I alternated between tears and the giddy excitement of a schoolboy throughout most of the movie. I'm sure that will be a common reaction. At the same time, Frodo's greed for the ring, and how it affects his relationship with Sam reminded me of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Elijah Wood is no Bogie, but he certainly can conjure up that all-encompassing greed when he wants to. I may get annoyed when he says ""Mr. Frodo,"" but Sean Astin's Sam is really a standout character here - he's kind of been the 2nd string sidekick in the past two, but he actually gets the honor of carrying the film to its remarkably quiet and moving finale even after displaying his prodigious talent as a young actor in the tense Mordor sequence. This may sound like a blanket comment, but everyone is simply fantastic in the film - even when they've been not-so-much earlier.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a compelling tale of redemption and heroism, and in a way, it has redeemed itself through this smashingly fantastic film.Yes, it does slip in a few moments (most notably at the very end, when it could end about 6 different times, but give Jackson some slack - it had to be hard to let go of it), but I really don't feel it was detrimental to the end result of the movie at all. The last 20 minutes or so, even when it's doing the ending fakeouts, it's a tearjerker - not only for what it means for the third film, but for what it means for the trilogy as a whole. I found myself smiling through being choked up at the end in one of the great scenes of the whole 10 hours of the epic: a group of people (I won't say who, for it might spoil things for those die-hard fans out there) sit around a table in a tavern clutching their ale and simply sit in silence. They've been through so much that words won't work. At times, I wonder if words will even work to describe what a great feat of American filmmaking The Return of the King is. I can give only this: Congratulations, Peter Jackson, you've made a masterpiece. Grade: A"	5.0	The first masterpiece of the trilogy - astonishing!	2004-01-20	6	4	2

Charlton	"Nothing ever put on film can outdo what your own imagination sees when you read Tolkien's trilogy.  I didn't expect Jackson's movies to do that.  I hoped Jackson wouldn't get it wrong...and that people who had never read the books would find the films entertaining in their own right.Peter Jackson far exceeded  my expectations.  ""The Return of the King"" IS better than the first two movies, but not by much, because they're all great: CGI, locations, costumes, attention to detail, the use of humor (watching members of the dead army swarm over a giant war elephant and bring it crashing down), and so many other elements makes this a great movie...possibly the greatest adventure film ever.The release of this movie with its message that nothing great comes without sacrifice  could not have come at a better time.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A17LSEN4UY4XZQ	M. Daneker	Strictly adapting JRR Tolkiens work into a film would have been at once impossible and at best irritating to watch. The books are an achievement in literature, in creation of language and world building. That said, something was missing from the books, characters. Those who say the characters in the film do not match the book are shallow on several levels.First, the Books have no characters, just names and positions in life.Second, the Appendixes and related stories and writings that influenced the screenplays.Third, what you think are characters in the book are your perception of the characters Tolkien wrote, Tolkien did little to nothing in character development.What Peter Jackson did here is nothing short of amazing. He took a long, complicated, stilted text written in the most bland prose -- don't get me wrong I've read the books several times and love them -- but Tolkien was a world builder and a linguist, not a story teller. What he did here was create a grand mythology, not a great adventure or a grand opus.Now, onto the film.On a grand scale this film blows every other epic out of the water. Who cares how faithful it is to the book, it's exciting, intelligent, emotional, spellbinding, brilliant and I would kill for a HDTV to view it on for the full 12 hrs.From the first moment to the last this is a thrilling, enthralling masterpiece made more exciting by the excised footage that shows the final confrontation with Saruman, the voice of Sauron and the romance of Faramir and Eowyn there's a more personal and deeper level to this version.You can't pass this up, you have to see this.	5.0	Improving on the stilted prose of JRR Tolkien	2004-12-07	19	12	7

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F	mdizzog	"Most trilogys have had the unluckiness of being ruined. The Alien trilogy started good but got worse to the point of people not caring. Starwars was ruined by new movies that just didn't capture the old essence of the force. Indiana Jones had Temple of Doom made which made the series less great. Matrix as many will tell you was ruined by it's additions. But, this movie completely does the other two justice. This entire series has been excellent.This movie focuses more on Frodo and Sam. Aragorn was focused on alot in ""The Two Towers"". He plays less of a role in this film as we see tons unfold. The battles are extremely well done, but I still think none of them come close to the rainy siege of Helms Deep. The movie isn't ""graphic"" as I heard one person say. There are some heads and mabye one or two limbs get cut off but nothing big. I didn't pay attention at the last 5 minutes because some of the people around me became too.... Well, after sitting 3 hours in a movie apparently some of the people in YOUR theatre may start to talk. It really takes away from the mood of the movie as it reaches the climax. If you have people in your theatre talking, tell them to sit down and shut up because I had to tell quite a few.Sam is the highlight of the movie though. He provides most of the drama. The movie also focuses on Perry and Gandalf. Towards the end of the movie I thought the credits were going to start going off every other minute but they do extend it quite a bit. Raise your expectations because the movie does do a great job of ending the series. Felloship lost the ""Best Picture of the Year"" to ""A Beautiful Mind"". Two Towers lost to ""Chicago"". I read on MSN that the underdog usually wins. If this movie does not win it would be an outrage. Every emotion and battle in the film is wonderfully done and comipletely blows away every other movie.

After seeing the first and second movie, I was compelled to read the books.  Anyhone who thinks these movies are good will be floored by Tolkien's words (and if you do happen to read, make sure to read the hobbit before the fellowship).As far as one other customer's review concerning Faramir...I agree with you.  I have yet to see the extended version of the two towers, and I hope that I do find Faramir's character better portrayed.  As far as whether or not Frodo dies...it would be hard for me to comment and not give anything away, but I think it would be a bad move, and make many LOTR fans dissappointed to replace what happens at Mt. Doom with anything that actually did happen...Peter Jackson made a point to throw in the ""pity"" stuff about Gollum (when they were temporarily lost in Moria in the movie), and several conversations between Sam and Frodo concerning Gollum.  It would seem to me, that if the original ending is not the way Jackson has ended it, all of this would be pointless, and therefore should have never been done for New Line to save some money.Also, there is a very important character who dies in the third book that never even sees the ring...the one who gave Gandalf his gift of speed.In any case, I think Jackson has stuck to the more important points of the story.  To change the ending from what Tolkien told would be to create a different tale, and (other than in Faramir's case) I dont see any evidence in the first two movies that would suggest this...however, Im just a reader, and a fan, not a literary scholar or playwrite...gotta get past college first. ;)"	5.0	Impatiently Awaiting	2003-12-01	10	2	8

It's hard to believe that they could improve something already so wonderful.  For the few extra dollars it takes to get this version of the film, there is enough material on these DVDs to keep you in front of your TV for two weeks trying to watch it all.  As a fan of the other LOTR:EEs, there was no way that I could pass this up!There are mild spoilers ahead; so, if you haven't read the books or seen the film, skip these next three paragraphs.  As far as the extra scenes added to the film, I feel it was a little bit of a mixed bag.  Some of the additions I thoroughly enjoyed.  The extra scenes with the Path of the Dead, Gandalf versus the Witch King, and expansion of Eowyn's character were highly enjoyable.  Aragorn looking into the Palantir was a welcome addition.  Also, I thought The Mouth of Sauron was wonderfully creepy.  He looked like something out of a Clive Barker film.Unfortunately, out of the three movies, this is the only time that a few of the extra scenes have disappointed me.  I don't know why, but the Death of Saruman and the Hobbits marching with the orcs fell a little flat with me.  I suspect it is because I am used to watching the theatrical version of the film, and those scenes will sit better after a few more viewings.  I found most the Gimli additions to be disappointing.  All the scenes added with his character reduced him to comic relief and, in my opinion, did not serve the story very well.Gothmog still does not work for me, though his extended scenes make him a bit more intimidating.  Still, his weird mushroom head looks completely out of place from the other orcs, and his voice is like Dr. Claw from the old Inspector Gadget cartoons.  I am not one of those people who complain when a movie does not follow the book, but I think the filmmakers missed a big chance with the Houses of Healing.  There was incredible potential to add some drama or romance, and the scenes felt very rushed.  The movie is already so long, but another four or five minutes to play out Eowyn and Faramir's relationship would have been nice.  My complaints are very minor, and the things that bother me are just nit-picking, and do not detract from the enjoyment of the film as a whole.Besides, after watching the two ""making of"" DVD's, there is no way to avoid appreciating the amount of work that went into these movies.  Seeing the incredible attention paid to detail on things that will be on screen less than a second (if at all) is amazing.  The first disc starts off by exploring the history of Tolkien, how the ""Silmarillion"" came about, and how it is connected to the rest of the series.  Any LOTR fan who hasn't read that book is really missing out on a wonderful story full of background information!  The documentaries continue from the first few discs, going into the work of WETA, the costume designers, and the set builders.  One of my favorite behind the scene's bit was about the horse training for the film.  I had never considered the incredible amount of work involved in training all of the horses to perform spot-on in the movie, and my respect for the filmmakers increased yet again.The second disc has a ""wrapping up"" feel to it.  It goes into a very moving look at the final days of shooting the film, then adding the digital and sound effects, composing the music, and finally the premier of the film.  One of the most incredible moments is when Peter Jackson was filming the last pick-up shot of the movie.  He didn't want to say ""cut"", because that would be one of the final steps in the production of these movies, and he would have to leave this wonderful world.  Many fans can relate to that moment, knowing as this final DVD ends, there will be nothing more to come from this imaginative world that Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens passionately adapted from Tolkien's creation.  Counltess members of the cast and crew gave up several years of their lives to dedicate themselves to a wonderful work of art that they can be proud of, and will be remembered for a long time."	5.0	A fantastic conclusion to a wonderful series.	2005-01-05	2	2	0

Gonya ""rawker"""	This movie lives up to the hype and expectation...all three and half hours of it. The movie deviates from the book; yes, but it is all done to make a great movie. The movie is well paced for being as long as it is and seems to blend together the Frodo, Sam, Gollum and the ring story well with all the other plot lines. The epic battle scenes are also well placed throughout the movie.It is great to see some of the most well known scenes from the book on film. Such as Pippin looking into the Palantir, Faramir being burned alive by his own father, the fight with Shellob and of course the casting of the ring back into the fires of Mount Doom. Fans of the book will miss the Saruman in the Shire scene at the end. As a matter of fact, Saruman is not in this movie at all.The movie does sort of drag by the time the group of hobbits reach the mouth of Mount Doom. Frodo becomes more the perpatrator of Gollum and the ring's demise in the movie which hard core fans of the book may not like. Overall, the setting is very much like the one imagined from the book.The movie isn't totally perfect. The acting from a few (more or less from Legolas)is a little weak at times. The end does begin to drag since the fact you've been sitting staring at the screen for over three hours sets in. But it is well deserved screen time.  Return of the King will probably go down as the best of the three. Lord of the Rings is probably one of the best film trilogies ever made. Most Trilogies have a stinker in the bunch but Lord of the Rings is a pretty consistant trilogy. Well done Peter Jackson.	4.0	A good end to a fantasy classic	2003-12-19	5	3	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"2003 marks the grand finale of an epic film series based upon J.R.R. Tolkien's (1892-1973) literary masterpiece, ""The Lord of the Rings"", which was published between 1954 and 1955.  The film company New Line Cinema gambled a $300-million budget to produce all three epic parts of the ""Lord of the Rings"" simultaneously under the direction of Peter Jackson, who was relatively unknown prior to the release of the first film, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"", in 2001.  The enormous success of the first film was equaled one year later with the release of the second film, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"".  Now, the final film in the trilogy, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"", demonstrates that Peter Jackson and other men and women who tirelessly worked on the films saved the best for last.With very few doubts, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"", is very likely the best film of 2003 and probably one of the best films of all time.  At 3 hours and 21 minutes, it is also the longest of the three theatrically released versions.  The film begins where the previous film left off:  Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee (Sean Austin) struggle to make their way to the land of Mordor and Mount Doom under the untrustworthy guidance of the creature Gollum/Sm&eacute;agol (Andy Serkis).  The people of Rohan have returned to their homes following the defeat of Saruman's forces at Helm's Deep. However, the forces of Mordor will soon be unleashed against the Kingdom of Gondor at its capital, Minas Tirith, as seen by Peregrin 'Pippin' Took (Billy Boyd) when he gazes into the captured seeing stone from Isengard.  Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin with him to warn Gondor, which is under the stewardship rule of Denethor (John Noble), of the impending attack.  Denethor is the father of Faramir (David Wenham) and the deceased Boromir (Sean Bean).  Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli son of Gloin (John Rhys-Davies) and Meriadoc 'Merry' Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan) ride to Rohan to ask King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and his daughter Eowyn (Miranda Otto) to help Gondor defend itself against the dark forces of Mordor.There are too many memorable scenes in the film to mention, but some include Gandalf & Pippin's arrival at Minas Tirith, Faramir & the soldiers of Gondor fighting the Orks, Pippin singing, Pippin climbing the tower, Denethor's fire, Frodo and the dead city, the Orc attack upon Minas Tirith, Sam & Gollum fighting, Frodo in the cave, the arrival of Rohan soldiers, the elephants, the ghosts, the defeat of the dark king, the Black Gate, Mount Doom, Sauron's tower, and the closing scenes.  The epic battle scenes at Minas Tirith are especially good and realistic, making you feel as if they have actually occurred; and the scenes at Mount Doom are some of the most emotionally gripping in the film.The superb acting in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" (especially of Ian McKellan, Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Viggo Mortensen, John Noble and Billy Boyd), the very realistic special effects and incredible cinematography draws the audience into the film and keeps it engaged throughout its 3 hours and 21 minutes.  It is very likely that the film will receive several Oscar nominations from the Academy Awards in 2004.  (I will be very surprised if the film is not nominated for Best Picture and Peter Jackson is not nominated for Best Director.)  I believe that J.R.R. Tolkien would have been absolutely thrilled to see his literary work transformed into the breathtaking, realistic epic film series that will no doubt entertain and amaze viewers for many years to come.  I will, without doubt, obtain a copy of the film on DVD, especially the extended version of the film, which will no doubt be even more engaging just like the previous two films as extended versions.  Overall, I rate ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend the film to everyone."	5.0	A Breathtaking Grand Finale From Peter Jackson	2003-12-30	12	11	1

In Return of the King the major glaring anomolies were the halls of healing and the scouring of the shire, marking the death of Sauraman.  All I can say, is Peter Jackson fulfills my needs in this extended version.  While not the same as the book these key scenes are handled very well.

The special effects took my breath away and the actors in the movie really worked their hardest on this movie.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AT393OR1JTYNR	Miami Nights	"I enjoyed ""Return of the King"" practically to the fullest. I found it better than the second installment. Before I get to the positives, I will second what another reviewer said, in that the film does get redundant at times (someone's in trouble, someone comes to save him/her) and it brings in characters without explaining who they are. Also, the ending was somewhat anti-climactic given what took place before it, although it does tie up some of the characters' stories. But at times, it seems rushed -- it doesn't tell us about what happens to Legolas, Gimli, Faramir, Eowyn, Eomer (who deserved more screen time) and others. We also don't see how Aragorn came into the people's good graces. But it has arguably some of the most moving moments in the trilogy (SPOILERS AHEAD!!) such as Denethor's insanity in wanting to give Faramir a honorable funeral/death and his cruel, heartless words to his son, Gollum's death, Frodo saying goodbye to Sam, Merry and Pippin. Despite its weaknesses, it's a nail-biter that will have you heavily anticipating what happens next -- the scene with Frodo and Shelob will have you gasping, cringing and ducking. It does finish off arguably the best trilogy made in the past 20 years or so, and I'll miss not having a new one to wait for, but it could have used a bit more depth and reached greatness, but as it is, it's a very good movie and worth seeing more than once."	3.0	It's a 3.5 star, a strong one	2003-12-18	10	2	8
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2TEP2FMBLHN1N	"Micah R. Sisk ""author of SF thriller PleshaCore"""	"I would like to ask director Peter Jackson one specific question: ""What ever--in your wildest dreams--made you believe YOU could tell this story better than J. R. R. Tolkien?"" I'd like to hear his answer because, despite my initial good rating of Fellowship of the Ring, by the time I finished watching all three films, I became completely convinced that Jackson has no clue why Tolkien's masterpiece works. He simply has no concept of the underlying forms and devises that make this enduring tale so alive, so vital and so meaningful. For Jackson, lacking this basic conceptual understanding, has re-written the great masterpiece as nothing more than a gung-ho, action-packed, Thrills-Spills-N-Chills romantic adventure that would more happily fit between the covers of a gaudy graphic novel than those of a work of renowned literature. He gives us the fundamental look of Middle Earth. He gives us cool computer graphics and the amazing elf-dude surfing down stairs on a shield and surfing up the side of an elephant the size of Chartres Cathedral. He even gives us the raw skeleton of the original story's plot . . . But where is the rich emotional content? Where is the complexity and subtlety of plot and character? Where is the character development? Where is the mystery, the charm, the poetry, the music or the sense of rich history so vital to making this world seem real? It's missing. All of it is missing.And what we're left with is a soulless bunch of good ol' fun--a roller coaster ride with heroes dropping off cliffs only to emerge unscathed a few scenes later; precarious collapsing bridges; narrow escapes from certain doom, and a bunch of ""Phew! That was close!"" clich&eacute; movie moments. Yee-ha. It's fun cinema if you're not interested in anything else. I mean if you'd really rather watch Indiana Jones than The Seven Samurai, then hooray for Peter Jackson. But, and this is the shame of it, the film could have passed beyond just plain fun, and perhaps even into the realm of the sublime, if some of Tolkien's charm and wonder had been allowed to percolate through the adrenaline pumped extravaganzas Jackson gives us.When a film is translated to screen there is always discussion about how much of a debt the director owes to the author of the work he is interpreting. In general it seems to be agreed by movie critics that the end justifies the means. If you make a good movie then the amount of mucking around with the source material is, well, immaterial. But how much of this should we really accept? There are some really incredible films we can look to for an answer. Take Throne of Blood by Kurosawa for example. I can think of no film that deviates more from its source material and yet stays so unerringly true to the original's spirit and intent An adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth, Throne of Blood is very possibly the best adaptation of The Scottish Play ever filmed. That, even though it is set in medieval Japan--that's right, it's a samurai film. And though a lot of the dialog is directly adapted from the play, it is in no way filmed in Shakespeare's stylistic verse--the very language so revered by we Westerners is missing. It is, however, unerringly faithful to the original's intense psychological content and to its characters in terms of their development, motivations and personalities, all of which Jackson is equally unfaithful too in his Lord of the Rings trilogy.And perhaps we should demand higher standards for screen adaptations of literary classics. Would you accept a film adaptation of Dickens's A Christmas Carol wherein the pre-haunting Scrooge is portrayed as not such a bad guy after all? Maybe he tosses the paupers singing Christmas carols a few coins instead of brusquely shoving them into the street with a harsh ""Be off with you!"" And then maybe during his haunting we can see all kinds of great special effects and watch Scrooge very nearly get killed by the ghosts, but he escapes by the skin of his teeth only to be confronted by the next set of action-packed ghoulish adventures. Wouldn't that be cool? Or would it simply be crap because we've changed a story to appeal to a &quot;wider&quot; movie audience, a story that needed no change in the first place?Look, a novel is a story. It relies on plot, character development, setting, language, emotional content and action to get its point across. So does cinema. There is no logical reason why a film cannot tell the same tale as a book. Any director who cannot do this either doesn't understand the original material or believes they can tell the tale better than the original author can. Or, I suppose they could also just want to leech off the fame of the source material, having no convincing tale to tell of their own. I further suppose that most directors translating books into film suffer from a combination of all of these, Jackson being no exception. If he had paid half as much attention to the story and character details as he did to the props, maybe we would have seen a film more worthy of bearing Tolkien's name. But, no, Jackson insists on giving us this testosterone-driven, quick-edit eye candy at the expense of any real content. And in so doing, Jackson is quite evidently milking the fame of Tolkien's work for as much fame and moolah as he can by jolting the pleasure centers of the un-read, cartoon-nurtured public's brains with syrupy romance, cliched serial-style cliff hangers and pubescent melodrama.I read an interview of Peter Jackson in which he declared that the theatrical releases of LOTR are the ""definitive cuts"" and that he considers the special addition DVDs with additional scenes to be ""novelties for fans of the book."" Yeah, I thought so. Jackson has relegated Tolkien's source material to the status of novelty."	2.0	Peter Jackson, How do I Hate Thee? Let Me Count the Ways	2004-06-18	43	18	25

Peter Jackson has outdone himself and he wont quit...The Hobbit would so kick ass if he does it. This chroniclizes up to the end where Frodo not throws, but pushes Gollum off the side into the fires of Mount Doom. With special effects that are simply amazing and more powerful and exceptional acting from the last. Viggo should be a king damnit..he would make a great leader as well. Ian McKellan is simply brilliant as Gandalf...Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are wonderful as Frodo and Sam..Orlando Bloom and John Ryhes Davies do the best at Gimli and Legolas and who can forget Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan as Pippin and Merry. If your not a fan of this stuff, why watch it? What's the point? I am glad it won 11 oscars with Best Picture but come on damnit, where are the nominees for acting? The award ceremony's are a joke. Truly an epic scale tale of groundbreaking preportions. Though the scary thing is that I saw Hugo Weaving who plays Elrond cry and I always think of him as Agent Smith in The Matrix movies and it's so funny..it's like it's Agent Smith crying!	5.0	the final chapter in the ring trilogy	2004-08-30	1	1	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	The LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy will become a classic because director/writer, etc. Peter Jackson had a vision, stuck to it, and gave us three masterpieces of cinematic excellence.  Taking such a complex book as Tolkien's series was no easy task and in spite of many obstacles, Jackson delivered a trio of unbelievably well made adventures.In this final chapter, Jackson's vision is beautifully realized with outstanding cinematography and editing; superb special effects and a wonderful cast of actors who were wrongfully ignored by Oscar for three years.In this installment, Sean Astin becomes the &quot;soul&quot; of the movie, as he is willing to do anything to enable Frodo (the underrated Elijah Wood) dispose of the ring.  Andy Sartis' Gollum is another epic piece of animation, effects and vocal talent, not to mention the way in which Sartis' physical presence was utilized in the making of Gollum.  Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill are superb as the king and his daughter; David Wenham, Karl Urban, Billy Boyd (who comes to true maturation in this film), Dominic Monaghan, John Rhys-Davies, and of course the incomparable Ian McKellen finally gets the screen time he deserves and uses it well.The battle scenes; the giant spider (probably the best ever captured on film); Howard Shore's magnificent score; the stunning visuals; the sets; the costumes.  This is what movie-making is all about.Whether you're a true Tolkien fanatic or just an average viewer like myself, you cannot deny the power and splendor of this magnificent achievement in film-making.Congratulations to Jackson and all for their 11 Oscars!	5.0	STUNNING FINALE	2004-05-31	7	7	0

Mazza	&quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; is a fitting conclusion to the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.  Directed by Peter Jackson, the story continues the saga of war and heroic quest set in a fantasy world populated by humans, elves, and other species.  Although this is a tale told on an epic scale, it is also rich in intimate character moments and drama.&quot;Return&quot; is full of huge battle scenes, amazing fantasy creatures, and breathtaking vistas.  Jackson delivers scenes that are full of visual detail.  Every creative aspect of the film--musical score, costumes, sets, etc.--is meticulously crafted and ultimately melds together as part of a compelling total vision.The large ensemble cast delivers outstanding performances; director Jackson wisely does not allow the amazing special effects and art direction to overwhelm the fine acting.  The film also maintains an effective balance of multiple story lines.  Although set in a fantasy world, &quot;Return&quot; is about themes and values that are relevant in our &quot;real&quot; world--loyalty, leadership, courage, and hope.  And in the end it's the moral and emotional vision of the film that really made an impact on me.  With this film, Jackson completes what is truly one of the great trilogies in all of cinematic history.	5.0	Triumphant conclusion to a great trilogy	2004-03-04	2	2	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3PPXVR5J6U2JD	"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien"""	"This final installment of Lord of the Rings is, at last, the conclusion to an epic saga that has been unspooling on screen only recently, but long since concluded in Tolkien's novels. Very quickly, those who have read the book are separated from those who have not - while the other movies were distinctly different enough to provide some surprises, the end is a foregone conclusion. It's all a matter of how sensitively Peter Jackson handles the emotions, the actors, and the plot.Fortunately, Jackson grew as a director. Where the second film felt uneven, the movement between several different groups (Frodo and Sam, Pippin and Gandalf, Merry and Eowyn) is flawless. The film never loses its rhythm until the end, and by then we all need a breather.My biggest concern about the film was the final battle. It only makes sense that Sauron would use the various troop types (flying forces, elite troops, heavy cavalry) to the fullest. Jackson does not disappoint. Trolls in battle armor wade into the fray as mumakils stomp on horses like ants. Wraiths on rothes tear up and terrify the unprepared human forces. And of course, orcs are everywhere; squealing, chortling, cackling, hacking, and dying.Jackson strikes the perfect balance between emotional pathos on screen and his desire to craft a war film. That desire was a little too strong in the second film, where orcs ran up to a fortification with polearms in hand. Polearms exist almost exclusively to 1) stop other polearms and 2) stop the unstoppable charge of cavalry. To use them in an assault on a castle is just plain silly. Jackson used them for effect (""Lookit all those polearms!"") but stopped just short of having the orcs start uselessly whacking away at the stones.In Return of the King, the orcs are led by a weirdly deformed pig-like orc named Gorbag who provides some actual leadership. He orders his orcs to set their pikes for a charge when the Rohirrim cavalry arrives. He orders his archers to fire at the right times. And he's such a bad ass, when a huge stone is catapulted towards him, he merely steps a few feet aside and spits at the projectile. Given all that attention, you would think Gorbag would get a cool fight scene like Lurtz did. No such luck.In fact, there are a few things that seem to be missing from the film. Certainly, the Mouth of Sauron is nowhere to be found (he'll be on the extended version, of course). There are also some unfulfilled promises, such as when the Witch King promises to ""crush the White Wizard."" He doesn't even go near Gandalf.But those are minor quibbles that are noticeable only after seeing the film in the theater six times. There are so many great moments that it's hard to keep track of them all: From Aragorn transforming into a leader before our very eyes, to Legolas taking down a mumakil single-handedly, from a song by Pippin as Faramir charges to his doom, to the last charge of Denethor off the cliff of Isengard. There is joy, there is sorrow, and there are inevitably plenty of tears - on screen and in the audience.The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the Star Wars of our time. It is a parable about the importance of friendship in a world gone mad, a world that will always have a parallel in geopolitical events. It stands as a testament to Jackon's and Tolkien's vision that the film works on so many levels, as an action film, as an allegory, as a romance, as a fairy tale, as a political commentary, and as a popcorn flick."	5.0	The Star Wars of our time	2004-03-22	1	1	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A5AUQ5R754O6E	"Michael Kavanagh ""HighburyGoon"""	(originally written Dec 18, 2003)Last night I was witness to one of the greatest feats in motion picture history. The Lord Of The Rings:The Return of The King is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made, and is in fact the best film of the last fifteen to twenty years.Peter Jackson and crew deserve every accolade that is being thrown upon them. If he does not win best director at this year's Oscars, the Academy should be disbanded.The final chapter of the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, &quot;Return Of The King&quot; follows our heroes as they continue on their separate journeys in the quest to save Middle Earth. Frodo and Sam continue to press on into Mordor in an effort to destroy the &quot;One Ring.&quot; Gandalf heads to the white city of Minas Tirith, with Pippen in tow, to warn the steward of Gondor of an impending orc attack on the city. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Merry, join the forces of King Theoden of Rohan in preparations for the coming war to save Gondor.The genius of the film is not only apparent in the special effects and amazing battle sequences, but - in an even more profound manner - in the ever present themes of human existance that are woven into the film. Courage, despair, ever-lasting love, unrequited love, joy, honor, duty, reponsibility, determination, hope, sorrow, fear, pain, rejection, deception, greed, friendship; little moments featuring quiet exchanges between characters coupled with triumphant overcoming of incredible odds.All of these are on display, and more often than not, I felt the emotions right along with the characters. It's one thing for my girlfriend to become uncomfortable while watching a sitcom character go through a sticky situation, it's quite another for me to be brought to tears while watching what is ostensibly an fantasy-action film.But, then, that's just it; &quot;Return Of The King&quot; is more than just another fantasy film, it is the ultimate allegory for life itself. To do the best with the time we're given, however trying they might be. To accept our responsibilites, however daunting or scary they might be. To fight oppression in whichever form it takes. To celebrate the things that matter most in this life. And having the wisdom to figure out exactly what those things are.If you haven't yet seen this film, then stop reading, and head to the theater immediately. We've been quite fortunate these past several Christmases, enjoying an annual gift from our friends in New Zealand. I for one will miss the family tradition that has sprung up over the last three years. It will most likely be some time before another film requires the amount of pre-planning among my family members that &quot;Return Of The King,&quot; and it's predecessors, &quot;The Fellowship Of The Ring,&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot; had made necessary.All hail &quot;The Return Of The King,&quot; a reminder (as well as the justification) of why we all go to the movies in the first place.	5.0	Long live the King	2004-06-19	9	8	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1XMDLSY97CLYK	Michael Kwiatkowski	I originally ordered this item on March 12th, 2006.  With the way I keep getting asked to give permission to extend the shipping deadline, I'm thinking I might end up waiting until March 12th, 2007 before it even goes out.Normally I receive very good, very fast service with amazon.com, and this appears to be the only exception.  And I place the blame squarely on the seller, whom I cannot seem to locate contact information for.I agreed to plop down the $63.99 price + s/h fir this item.  I think after all the delays I ought to get a significant discount if or when it finally does get shipped out.Now the film itself is superb, and is an excellent finisher to a lengthy film trilogy.  Being something of a book-to-film purist, I kind of wish Jackson had kept Saruman's and Wormtongue's original fates--in the book, they both die in Hobbiton.  But, Jackson is a master of dramatic/creative license and Christopher Lee's death scene at Isengard in the extended DVD more than makes up for the alteration.  The thing to remember for fans of the movies is, this was always meant to be an epic story; it's supposed to be an all day adventure for filmgoers, when you take in the trilogy as a whole.  I highly recommend scheduling a day off during the week and invite friends over to watch all three extended versions, back to back.  Set up lunch and dinner breaks in between films, as well as bathroom breaks, and enjoy the day's adventure.All in all, my only real complaint is the hideous delay in shipping.  I should not have to wait a month or more for the iten to ship, and if the seller is wise he'll spot me a nice discount on the original $64 price for the trouble.  That is, of course, assuming the item ships at all; I'm half tempted next time they ask for an extension to just cancel the order. If I didn't want this collector's copy so badly, I would do just that.  I hope the seller reads this.	5.0	Forever And a Day to Ship	2006-04-12	5	2	3

It applies to everyone today, from the mugger on the street to the preacher in the church.  The basic elements here are friendship and Good vs. Evil.  When you see the inserted scene of Sam and Frodo parting ways, you can not honestly say it did not jerk a little tear.  The only friendship that is truly held close together the whole movie broken up by corruption and greed.Also with the Good vs. Evil, this is the main plot of the movie.  Sauron's dark forces wanting to destroy everything in Middle-Earth and turn it all into darkness versus the free people of Middle-Earth.  It is a clash of the armies of Darkness against the army of the &quot;Light&quot; so-to-speak.Also to those that are bashing such areas as the ghost and the ending.The ghost were once a powerful army led by Isildur, but they ran out on him and for that he cursed them to never rest until they fulfill their promise to help Gondor.  Aragorn purposesly goes into the Paths of the Dead to begin to reclaim who he is and to let the ghost fulfill their promise and be set free.The ending was there for a reason.  People wanted a happy ending,  that's obvious.  Several people I have talked to consider this a sad ending.  While it is in some aspects, it's not in others.  Yes, Sam loses his best friend in the world and the Elves all leave Middle-Earth because the magic begins to fade.  Yet through all this you see Samwise happy with his wife and Bilbo gets to see a place untouched by time before he dies.Just watch the movie carefully and you will come out changed.	5.0	-Explaining it all-	2004-05-25	1	1	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1919P4WABZA6Y	Michael M. Stratford	"There's absolutely no need to shower more praise on this extended masterpiece; it's fully as rich a filmgoing experience as is possible, given the limitations of Tolkein's material (some of which, I say much to the horror of the purists, Jackson improves upon).I easily give it the best rating ever for a fantasy adventure, BUT I and everyone else who saw the theatrical release waited far too long to see the complete story.  Christopher Lee's final scene as Saruman, which stunningly wraps up both the wizard's and Wormtongue's plotlines, is thrilling, shocking, excitingly filmed and utterly crucial to the plot and film.  In addition to wrapping up these narrative threads, the sequence even throws in a bit of ""Scouring of the Shire"", and actually does Tolkien one better, I think (I never liked Saruman's reduction to 'Sharkey', an ordinary thug, or his prosaic death in the original book).Everything else, even the attachment between Eowym and Faramir, the breaking of Gandalf's staff and the Mouth of Sauron, could legitimately be considered non-crucial, although I'm glad to finally have them, especially the latter; I relish how Aragorn ""concludes negotiations"".Besides feeling cheated, Lee must feel a sense of deja vu: in the last days of Hammer, he filmed ""To the Devil a Daughter"" (a much less successful adaptation of Dennis Wheatley than the far superior ""Devil Rides Out"")--and his entire death scene as the Satanist was cut!  Was Jackson feeling nostalgic for movies such as this, that don't even give their bad guys a proper comeuppance?Whatever.  Mr. Lee, you're the best ever, whether in black cape, white robe or British tweeds, and I'm delighted there is a yet another revival of your film work.  Had it not been for Peter Jackson's lapse in judgment in the final theatrical cut, we'd have had it sooner.  Jackson deserves every buck his trilogy made, and every award it ever won, but if he ever puts Mr. Lee in a film again, I hope he'll give the devil his due."	5.0	Greatest of epics, but Chris Lee was robbed!	2005-01-24	5	4	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A257KXBOBFRLCN	"Michael Romero ""music lover"""	While &quot;Return of the King&quot; certainly holds up the fine cinematic craftsmanship of the first two movies, this installment feels incredibly contrite in comparison. Part of this probably comes from the fact that Jackson left so much of the books to be told in the movie. In the effort to fit everything in, many characters, which had been painstakingly developed over the first two movies, become charicatures of themselves. This holds especially true for Aragorn, who has miraculously morphed from ranger running from his past to fearless leader and king. Saurman, who was an important part of the first two movies, isn't even seen in the theatrical release. It is this kind of thing that makes the movie frustrating. Furthermore, the first two movies did not sacrafice character development for the sake of the effects, but that feels like it's happened in this installment.Overall, the movie is satisfying, but not nearly at the level of the first movie -- and certainly NOT worthy of the 11 oscars it won over more deserving contenders (e.g., Lost In Translation).As for the DVD, picture and sound quality are top notch, but features are thin.Perhaps the forthcoming extended release DVD will allow fans to realize this film for what it could have been.	3.0	Does not compare to the first two installments	2004-07-22	8	3	5
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	APY3YFXQPPWMT	Michael R. Springston	More preaching to the choir, but Peter Jackson has done what none of us ever thought possible with the entire trilogy. When I read it in the '70's, I naively looked forward to a movie version, not realizing what an undertaking that would be. CGI technology really made the movie possible and DVD's allowed Jackson to cater to all of us geeks by offering expanded versions that most mainstream movie-goers would not be able to sit through.We all knew story lines would be trimmed, so it is amazing how faithful Jackson remained to Tolkien's books, given that limitation. And however you imagined Minas Tirith (or Two Tower's Helm's Deep), the filmed battle scenes rank among the best action sequences ever conceived.If I had a disappointment, it was the Crack of Doom scene. Since first reading the book, I always thought the sight of Gollum dancing at the edge of the cliff with Frodo's finger STILL in the ring as an incredible image. I felt a little cheated when Gollum took the finger out of the ring; Tolkien's written version had an element of horror that added volumes to the evil power associated with the ring.But I always thought THAT was really the book's climax. All of the closure after that, even the Scouring of the Shire, were the very definition of anti-climatic. Jackson certainly cut wisely by condensing that part of the book.But I also know he is more attuned to this material than any of us could ever hope. Whatever pre-conceived notions we brought to this movie, Peter Jackson and his crew were true believers and they made this classic accessible to millions who would never think of reading such voluminous books.Jackson's cinematic achievement is to movies what Tolkien's work was to literature. If that seems hyperbole, remember that Tolkien accomplished his books by himself, while Jackson had help from thousands of cast and crew members. But strictly from an artistic level, all 3 Lord of the Rings films will likely be in the low numbers of any future AFI Top 100 list.Add on the extras in the DVD's, well, if you're reading this review you probably already have this set.	5.0	Quibbles aside	2005-01-26	5	5	0

From the intense battles, destruction of the ring, to the final scene when Frodo and others sail away, the movie kept my interest.While I have a hard time remembering and pronouncing many of the characters' names, their images will remain for a long time. At the conclusion, I felt a sense of relief - not that the triology was completed, but that good ultimately triumphed over evil!While the battle scenes are intense and other images can be scary for younger audiences, at least there is no cursing, drug abuse, or naked scences so prevalent in Hollywood movies.Watch and enjoy!	5.0	Excellent Finale to the Trilogy!	2004-06-25	2	1	1

I was quite worried that the movie wouldn't stand up to its predecessors - but it succeeds oh so well!  It is not a perfectfilm - that would be expecting too much - but it comes close enough.First, I'd like to mention some of the criticisms and weaknesses.  Many reviewers feel the movie has ""too many endings"".  It can certainlyfeel that way - but the finale is reasonably faithful to the books, as it had to be if Peter Jackson was going to be true to Tolkien's vision.  Ifound the finale profoundly moving.  I did feel that Eowyn got short-changed in her scene with the Nazgul and King Theoden - I wanted more.  I also felt that the coronation could have been more faithful to the book, though that would have entailed making an already long movie even longer.  Finally, Denethor is so completely unsympathetic as a character that I feel he is almost a charicature.  In the book, we know that he has looked into the Palantir and is thus infected by Sauron's evil, and that makes him a more sympathetic figure.  It also gives him a closer connection to Pippin and helps us understand the bond between these two.  I found the opening a bit off-setting on the first viewing, but by the third viewing I found the Smeagol - Deagol - Gollum triangle informative and worthwhile.These criticisms are relatively minor.  The rest of the movie is so well done as to smother them.  In a movie rich with incredible performances, I'd like to mention Sam (Sean Austin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) in particular.  Sam's pathos when Frodo orders him to go home is heart-wrenching, and Gollum has shown that the computer/actor has come of age.In the special features of the extended version of the Fellowship of the Ring, Viggo Mortensen notes that the attention directed towards how many awards and how much money these movies garner is much like the One Ring - it can misdirect our attention from the story.  Smart man; in the end it doesn't really matter whether ""Return"" is the second movie to make a billion dollars or wins ""Best Picture"".  What matters is the trilogy's ability to convey the power of loyalty, friendship and hope in our daily struggles against our own version of the Ring.  All the people associated with this work of art deserve our praise - they've given us an epic for our times."	5.0	A glorious return	2004-01-06	2	2	0

Well, Peter Jackson and his talented crew have further improved the Return of the King.  The loving attention to detail and the professionalism in this new version is amazing.The extended version is truly a new movie.  It follows the book much more closely and the time sequence of the battles coordinates better with all the things going on in the background. The extended version allows the actors to better develop their characters.  The extra features are also well worth the price of the DVD. There were only one or two short shots that could have been left out, but there are so many new shots that improve the overall effect, it is truly amazing.Since this is just a DVD version that would probably sell a lot of copies no matter what they put out, they didn't need to put so much effort into it.  But each department has come up with such amazing attention to detail and completed everything so well that it is like getting an entirely new movie.  The score, the special effects, the acting, the editing: all the departments have done a top notch job.I was a little sad in thinking that last year was the final chapter in Lord of the Rings, little did I know that Peter Jackson and all the myriad of people working on the LOTR series had a Christmas present coming for the world in 2004: the extended version of The Return of the King.	5.0	Improving on the Best	2004-12-14	7	3	4

I'm praying with the rest of my fellow LOTR geeks that it will be in the extended edition.  I have to say that there are exactly TWO movies based on books that are better than the book, and the rest of them are the other way around.  The first is American Psycho.  The second, as much as I love the books, is Lord of the Rings. Jackson just did too good a job.  And out of the three, I believe Return of the King is the best and one of the greatest movies of all time.Of course this is far more Tolkien's genius than Jackson's...in his focus on characters over plot and his obsessive/compulsive attention to detail, this is a masterpiece.  I thought the Matrix series would be this generations ""Star Wars"" at first.  I was WAAAY off.  ""Lord of the Rings"" takes that mantle and goes several feet beyond (and I'm an original ""Star Wars"" lover from hell...the FIRST 3 from the 70's/80's only of course and only the NON-SPECIAL EDITION versions.)So if you haven't seen this movie WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??

This film is a tale of duplicity, cut from the same cloth as ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Leonard, Part 6"". There is symbolism and high emotions representing the randomly unchanged depths of man's (and indeed, Hobbit's) souls. This symbolism is made clear during the 13 hour sitting in the theater. Although the terror and befuddlement felt by the viewer will be staggering, there will be an understanding between you and the characters that is unparalleled since ""Happy Thanksgiving, Charlie Brown.""Heretofore, there is no reason to feel discouraged by all of this. Understand that this story is a perfect marriage of international intrigue and campy humor. It is a sublime masterpiece whose characters muddle aimlessly through the enchanting realm of their own focused and determined existences. It is, to put it mildly, obliviously paradoxical to think of the obvious underlying themes that co-exist in the vast tapestry of infinite plot that is ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"". One realizes, in summation, that this tapestry would certainly be unraveled if one thematic element was removed (as was the case with ""Airplane 2: The Sequel"" and ""Gone With the Wind""). It's astonishing when you think of the unparalleled skill and boredom it took to produce such a film.Not since ""Superman III"" have we seen a film that is, at its very essence, about love, deception, greed, lust, and unbridled enthusiasm. It is ultimately the unbridled enthusiasm which leads to the climactic events and the downfall of all those who failed gloriously in this story. The photography really is the driving element of this blissful saga. No questions to be made on that point!

I own all 3 Lord of the Rings movies, and am happy to have them in my collection.  If you like action, fantasy, or medieval content, you should own this trilogy.  The effects are seamless, the acting is well done and the story keeps you involved at all times.Lord of the Rings is quite a concept, originally brought forth by J.R.R. Tolkien decades ago. Unfortunately, his book was 1,137 pages long, which is a daunting read. Thankfully, his book has been brought to the big screen for more of a mainstream approach, and where more people can enjoy it. If nothing else, it is easier to enjoy.The L.O.T.R. movies are not short by any means, but if the other option is reading over a thousand pages, I choose the movies. Besides, you will probably enjoy yourself so much watching the movies that they will not seem so long.Fit this movie and the previous 2 into your life.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	"With the release of ""The Return of the King,"" it's now official: Peter Jackson's film trilogy of ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the greatest series of fantasy films ever made. In breadth and depth of vision, brilliance of craft and fidelity to the source material, there is nothing that remotely compares with it. And ""The Return of the King"" is the finest of the three individual films, combining exciting action and jaw-dropping special effects with fully-fleshed, three-dimensional characters. There are, of course, disappointments. For example, why didn't Jackson film Tolkien's ""Scouring of the Shire"" chapter for ""Return of the King""?  It seemed so clearly presaged in the scenes of hobbits in chains in ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" and it would have brought the story of Saruman to a satisfying end. But everything Jackson DID put on screen is so wonderful that pressing the point seems churlish. The Battle of Minas Tirith--with its legions of orcs, and especially with Legolas doing battle with one of Tolkien's ""olyphaunts""--alone deserves immediate ranking as one of the greatest battle scenes ever put on film. And Gollum--a collaboration between actor Andy Serkis and Jackson's special effects team--is as creepily brilliant a creation as ever. While ""The Return of the King"" is of course an ensemble piece like the previous two films, special mention must be made of the exquisite performances of Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Sam. Tolkien's chapters of Frodo and Sam alone in Mordor comprise, for my money, the most moving depiction of friendship of any novel in the last century, at some points reaching a Dickensian intensity. To say that Wood and Astin do justice to the original is very high praise indeed, but also giving them their due. The complete boxed DVD set of ""The Lord of the Rings"" will be a must-have for every household when it is eventually released, but ""The Return of the King"" is the crown jewel of the collection."	5.0	The greatest fantasy film ever made.	2004-01-08	3	2	1

The theatrical version of ROTK was my absolute favorite of the three movies.  I eagerly anticipated the addition of the Extended Edition to my collection.I loved most of the additions added back into the EE, but some of them left me wanting different things.  I would've rather have seen what happened to Legolas and Gimli after the Ring was destroyed rather than see the two in a drinking game.I'm sure every fan has a list of things they wish would've been included in the films that wasn't.  I know I do.  However, I still think the movie is an excellent addition to the trilogy, and I'm looking forward to when I have the time to have a marathon.The extras are top notch!  The care that the cast and crew had with these movies is evident as you watch the hours of additional material.  Some of the information isn't brand new, but there is a lot of great stuff.  One thing that I found particularly moving were the last days of the cast members and the documentary about the young man with cancer.As a sucker for commentary, I loved PJ, Fran, and Phillipa's track.  They're all very funny...I especially enjoyed with PJ shooshes Fran about a ""crack of doom"" comment.  Also, the cast commentary is enjoyable as well.  I could listen to just a Billy Boyd/Dominac Mognahan track and be content.  Sean Astin and Elijah Wood are a little sickening sweet though.Finally, the Easter Eggs are funny -- the one on the first disc is great!

But of course Jackson & co. did an astounding job, and  it was obvious from the beginning that the writers & designers had a great respect and understanding of Tolkien's world. ""Return of the King"" is without a doubt the pinnacle of their supurb work: incredible CGI, exquisit scenes/locations/costumes/props, believable and surprisingly good acting, and one of the best screenplays of all time.The extended edition adds more of everything we love to the story.  Die-hard fans of Tolkien will love all the extra footage, especially the sideline stories like the House of Healing and the Mouth of Sauron.  People who don't absolutely love LOTR will likely find the over four hours' worth of film exhausting and bombastic, though.  Jackson didn't even shoot ""The Scouring of the Shire,"" so don't expect anything new with the ending. Otherwise, with this longer version, we see just how accurately he created Middle-Earth, and the changes/omissions were minute enough (or logical enough for film adaptation) that Tolkien's world loses none of its splendor.The two disks of Appendices are such a thrill.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"Having successfully resisted an attack of Sauron's forces on the kingdom of Rohan, Gandalf (Ian McKellan) discovers that Sauron is preparing his next and greatest attack on Minas Tirith, capitol of Gondor, the kingdom to whose throne Aragorn is heir. Gandalf and Pippen (Billy Boyd) travel to Minas Tirith to try to convince the city's self-absorbed Steward of the impending peril. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and Rohan's King Theoden (Bernard Hill) lead Rohan's armies toward Minas Tirith, where they will make their stand against the advancing Armies of Mordor. Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) have penetrated the borders of Mordor and continue to make their way toward Mount Doom, guided by the treacherous Gollum, as Frodo struggles under the weight of the Ring's burden.With this final chapter in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, director Peter Jackson brings the story to its conclusion in spectacular fashion worthy of the first two installments. The ability to maintain quality across three movies may largely be due to their being filmed continuously with no breaks or regrouping between the three films. ""The Return of the King"" is the longest of the three films at 3 hours 15 minutes. And that is where I find fault with it. The opening sequence serves no purpose, and the final act, which is a sort of epilogue, seems to go on endlessly and say very little. The camera work is conspicuously languorous as well. In dramatic scenes the camera often lingers in one place so long that the audience may grow impatient and wonder offhandedly if it is stuck. A half hour could have easily been trimmed from this film without any detrimental effect, and it should have been. There will be plenty of room for extraneous material on the ""Extended Edition"" DVD. Apart from that, ""The Return of the King"" is a satisfying and rousing conclusion to ""The Lord of the Rings"" epic. The battle sequences are spectacular. The visual effects are impressive. And the cast is wonderful. Ian McKellan's and Viggo Mortensen's commanding onscreen presence befits their mythical characters. And I have to admire Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise Gamgee  more than any other performance in the trilogy. ""The Return of the King"" is cornier than either of its predecessors, and it is extremely sentimental. Sometimes that's laid on a bit thick, but it's to be expected in a concluding chapter, and it isn't unlike the book on which it is based. The pace of ""The Return of the King"" more closely resembles ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" than ""The Two Towers"", and its attention to the Hobbits does as well. ""The Two Towers"" remains my favorite film of the trilogy because I prefer its swift pace, and, even though I was obsessed with Tolkien's books as a child, I was never fond of Hobbits. If you like Hobbits, they are back in the center of the action in ""The Return of the King"". Screenwriter Frances Walsh has admirably accomplished the superhuman task of condensing JRR Tolkien's books into workable screenplays. I always felt that the book ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was superior to ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"". And I don't think that the film ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" captured that book's themes. On the other hand, I believe the films of ""The Two Towers"" and ""The  Return of the King"" have, if anything, improved on the books, and Frances Walsh is due the credit. Peter Jackson, Frances Walsh, and thousands of cast and crew have created a cinematic event  in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which people of all ages and cultures will be watching for centuries to come. Congratulations to all who contributed."	4.0	Rousing, Satisfying & Long Conclusion to the Epic Tale.	2004-05-06	9	5	4
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A123RB8YBOV2I6	"""misseguerin"""	"Before I truly begin this ""review"" let me tell you all a little about myself.  I  have been obsessed with the Lord of the Rings even since I saw the first film at my Aunt's house.  When I first heard about The Fellowship of the Ring, I looked down on it with disdain, thinking it would be a totally and completely dumb movie.  Boy was I wrong.  I've kepy track of everything Lord of the Rings I could get my hands on, and have seen the movies...uh...double digits amount of times. (So many that I can quote any line.)  I also have a huge collection of LOTR memorabilia sitting in my room.  But now, for the review.  I can pretty much say that this isn't a TRUE review, because I haven't seen the movie itself, but I have seen clips of it, and knowing how good the first two in the series were, I can only imgine how good The Return of the King will be.  I mean, anyone who can honestly say that the entire trilogy is bad is kidding themselves.  This movie is not only a theatrical masterpiece, but a story that we can apply to our loves as human beings, with internal and external battles against ourselves and the world around us....it's a movie that teaches us about human nature and about having hope, while keeping us screaming for more.  I'm positive from what I've seen so far that The Return of the King will surpass its formers and rise to the top of all movies.  If you are a LOTR follower, you probably know the following:  Frodo and Sam under Gollum (yes, the evil side of Smeagol) are being led into a trap.  Galdalf, Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli have just finished the Battle of Helm's Deep and are going soon to fight the biggest battle ever.  Galdalf takes Pippin away from everyone because Sauron has come to believe he is the Ringbearer, and Merry becomes a soldier.  Now tell me, how can a movie with all this happening not be absolutely wonderful?!?!?  If you have never seen any of these movies, I STRONGLY suggest that you watch the first two and then go to see The Return of the King in theatres, because I guarentee if you truly understand the film, you'll adore it!!!P.S.  To Naomi Tilley from Australia that ALSO wrote a review:  yes, Aragorn DOES go through the Paths of the Dead, don't worry!!! :)"	5.0	The Lord of the Rings-The Final Film	2003-10-15	11	4	7

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1AFXJ8U72MD6L	"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie"""	"RETURN OF THE KING finishes the stunning trilogy of Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS. In this tale, Frodo & Sam continue on to foreboding Mordor while the rest of the Fellowship fights the massive armies being sent out by Sauron, the dark lord.From the movie, it would appear Jackson & creative team take some liberties with Denethor (i.e. he was controversial and stuffy but in the movie he's just an idiot), as well as leaving out the Scouring of the Shire (i.e. not enough time and anti-climatic, they say in the extended DVD of Fellowship) and what is happening over the rest of Middle Earth (i.e. in the trilogy the other areas of good are under attack, so, it's not like the other elves, dwarves and humans are sitting back).The final film has the usual elements we have grown to love:(1) snappy, funny replies from Gimli;(2) the usual competitive streak between Gimli and Legolas, which includes one part where Legolas drops an elephant and Gimli says, ""That only counts as one!""(3) Sam being the heart of the film. In fact, he steals some of the best lines. Look for one of my favorites in the orc tower as he says, ""And that's for me old gaffer!"";(4) Pippin getting into trouble;(5) even more epic scope battles than in TWO TOWERS (yes, even with the extended version);(6) Aragorn using his leadership to create strengh in the ranks of men . .. Gandalf helps a lot, too;(7) Gandalf using his powers to ward off evil, including the Nazgul (i.e. the flying dragons);(8) lots and lots of evil things;(9) a chance to finally see Mordor and the evil which rests within, including the creepy, slimy and chilling Shelob, a giant spider that looks too real;(10) the final erosion of Gollum's mental abilities, including a flashback to how he found the ring and slew his brother for it;(11) a stand off between Eowyn and the Witch King;(12) The charge of Rohan in Gondor, where they decimate orc ranks but then have to deal with massive elephant legions;(13) the lighting of the fires, which goes off all over Middle Earth, it seems, to call Gondor's allies to aid, as waves of orcs and other baddies arrive.; and(14) The bittersweet ending and the sailing of the last White Ship, which includes Frodo, who realizes that the ring has taken its toll on his personage and that he can't go back home again. He is emotionally scarred and after four years in the Shire he leaves on the White Ship with Gandalf, Elrond & Galadriel.The talk around Hollywood is that this film will not only be nominated for best film with the Academys but will also win. Golden Globes has given it several awards already, too.For those who have gotten nostalgiac that the series has ended, cheer up. Peter Jackson has expressed a keen interest in doing THE HOBBIT. That said, with all the money Hollywood made, I'm feeling they're going to try and also do something with THE SILMARALLION, assuming the Tolkien estate doesn't put up a huge fight, that is.Overall, a great epic conclusion to the trilogy. Look to the DVD to fill in rushed or missing slots.Purists of the novels will have their gripes; everyone else will love it."	5.0	!!!!!!!!!!!!

The grand scale that they're on is amazing and the fighting scenes are intense, as always. I love Legelos and Aragorn! They are the highlight of this movie because Viggo Morinson and Orlando Bloom give awesome performances. The hobbits were very good (with the slight exception of Frodo who sometimes gets on my nerves when he disses Sam, his best friend). My two favorite scenes were when Billy Boyd as Pippin sang that song and Legelos finished off that elephant-thing (he is soooo cool). The ending is probably the worst part. It is dragged on WAY too long.What's with Frodo leaving and I don't care who Sam marries. Frankly I don't care that much about the Hobbits at all. They should have just ended it at the scene where Aragorn is crowned king. Otherwise this movie was AWESOME. It's very touching and keeps you on the edge of your seat.-Murl	5.0	WOW!	2006-12-20	4	1	3

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2AFQW8X5W023R	M. Klunk	"As an avid reader, I am virtually always terribly disappointed in the movie version of a book I enjoyed.  This is an exception, and since LOTR is up there with favorite books of all time, this was wonderful to experience.The changes from the book were few and (I felt) warranted.  Taking out the Tom Bombadil part worked for me.  Tom Bombadil is his own story, and LOTR did not suffer from his absence.  The only problem left from taking him out was getting swords to the hobbits.  It was taken care of in a rather clinical way on Weathertop by Strider. Bombadil was ""chaff"" as compared to the rest of the story.  Killing Saruman in The Two Towers removed the necessity for the last part of ROTK, where the hobbits return to see the Shire decimated by him (but it messed up Sam's gift, I could accept that, too, as necessary) and must regain it.  I think that part was depressing, and although it was fine in the book, too much time in the movie would have had to have been devoted to this part, which occurred after the main story was completed.  So I applaud taking that part out.Arwen's part in saving the injured Frodo from the black riders was added, but since Arwen's part in the books was not extensive, I can appreciate them putting more of Liv Tyler in the movie.Due to the length of each movie, there simply was not enough time to leave the omitted parts in - the essential parts remained.Having Eowyn receive Theoden's dying words rather than Merry...minor.A miraculous rendition of Tolkiens masterpieces!I have never enjoyed any movies so much.Some movies get re-made years later.  I think these will not.The casting was perfect, the acting quite good, the scenery breathtaking, and the story first-rate.  Tolkien would definitely approve!Well, that's MY opinion, at least!"	5.0	Book-to-movie excellence	2005-10-13	4	3	1

The extended version fills in gaps in the storyline, adds depth to characters and has longer and more graphic battle scenes.I am sad to see this great trilogy end...it was quite wonderful to experience the drama of awaiting the release of three movies that make up one great story; not unlike the Star Wars of my early teen years.	5.0	Quite Magnificent	2005-01-02	5	3	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"Though most of what I say in this review will mostly be redundant of what others have said about the final chapter in the screen adaption of ""Lord of the Rings, ""The Return of the King"" vanquishes all doubts of the trilogy bug from biting Peter Jackson in the butt.  The trilogy is now a model for franchise filmmaking excellence, with each successive chapter as good, if not better than the last.  In ""King,"" Andrew Lesnies' cinematography still looks breathtaking, Howard Shores' score still full blooded and inspired and the film is masterfully written, edited and directed by Peter Jackson, who should reign supreme at this year's Oscars.""The Return of the King"" is this years' best film, with an epic and passionate scope (the film is about 200 minutes).  However, ""King"" is the chapter with the most depth, the kind that reveals itself over time, punctuated by an acute and uncanny sense of character, plot and allegory that would make Tolkiein proud, despite some depressing omissions from the story, notably Saruman (Christopher Lee).  But what Jackson and his team do wrong, they do ten times that right.The film picks up after the downfall of Saruman and his devastated armies after Helms' Deep.  The surviving members of the Fellowship (minus Frodo and Sam) travel to the man Kingdom of Gondor, where they learn that Sauron will make his first strike.  Gondor, once proud, is withering under the failing courage (and sanity) of Denethor (John Noble), the father of the deceased Boromir.  The insuing battle that occurs is utterly spectaular, with boulder throwing catapults, charging Mumakil and sieging Trolls and Orcs.  It comes to a head when Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and his faithful companions arrive with the powerful Army of the Dead at their disposal.Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still trying to penetrate Mordor with the deceitful aid of Gollum (Andy Serkis).  Gollum shows his true ambitions, leading the Hobbits to the dark mountain lair of Shelob, a gigantic spider whom Sam must fight off by himself.  Sean Astin shines in the film, the embodiment of fierce loyalty and determination.  Elijah Wood plays Frodo as a deteriorating soul, staggering towards a tragic destiny, and he does it with surprising grace and feeling.  Andy Serkis makes Gollum a full-blooded and, dare I say it, human character, one of the most fully realized of the three films.It's hard to find films the caliber of ""Lord of the Rings,"" ambitious movies that hit grand slams every time they got the chance, and given Peter Jackson all the credit in the world for being the able manager.  These are the films he seemed tailored for, grandiose in every sense of the word but with some of the best characters put to the screen in a long time.  Credit the cast for that feat.  In fact, just shower Jackson and his crew with all the accolades, awards and praise you can drum up.  They will all deserve every word."	5.0	"Hail ""The Return of the King"""	2003-12-30	2	2	0

McGaha ""Shillelagh73"""	(...)Seeing the Return of the King without having also seen Fellowship and Towers may leave one a little bewildered at first, but my sister saw the movie without the experience of the previous two and was simply awe-struck with this movie.  Funny thing is, she doesn't even like sci-fi/fantasy movies.  She seemed to get into it just fine.Honestly, to get the full enjoyment and fulfilment that this film offers, you really have to see all three.  I don't see why anyone would want to view any of the latter parts of a trilogy without first seeing the first, but I still think R.o.t.K can stand alone.If you like a nice epic that draws you into itself, suspends all reality and disbelief, with pupil-dilating special effects that either push you deeper into your seat, or abruptly snatch you out of it, this is your film.  What this movie does, like no other film I've ever seen, is it brings the viewer into the lives of seven different characters, and provides that viewer with a familiarity and an understanding of those characters that is unprecedented.  The characters become very real, and you cycle through a full range of empathetic emotions for them.  I've seen masterpiece films in which one can gain this experience with one or two characters, but never on this scale.  Seeing the previous films just enhances the experience.Lord of the Rings, both the book and the movie trilogy are a great experience that I highly recommend to anyone.

After the first one I found a new respect for a genre I grew out of (or thought I grew out of) in middle school, and couldn't wait to see the next one. After seeing The Two Towers I was hooked and started preaching the movies to people who hadn't seen it. I compared Two Towers to the powerfulness of Braveheart. I believe the movies have an underlying message that is very strong that anyone can relate to. The plan was to see the first two on DVD a.s.a.p and to see Return of the King in theatres before it was too late. So I went and saw it the last month it was out in mainstream theatres (and was still sold out!)and was amazed. The trilogy not only had unbelievably deep music, great characters that get built up nicely and you feel as if you know them personally (despite what a few other reviewers who apparently weren't paying attention due to their short attention spans have said)UNBELIEVABLE ACTING from great actors, great special effects and a great plot that has worked great in each of the movies. My hat is off to Peter Jackson for a great translation of the books and to New Zealand for providing and amazing backdrop for these movies to take place. If you have seen the movies and didn't like them; see them again. If you haven't seen the movies due to it seeming a little too nerdy, go give these movies a chance. I'm glad I did.	5.0	Amazing end to an awesome trilogy!	2004-07-01	0	0	0

The vast majority, however, appear to concur with my opinion, that this is a breathtaking conclusion to a fantastic movie series.  There are, obviously, several parts of the written story that have to be rearranged to make the movie work, some parts that have been reduced, some that have been expanded, and some that have been completely eliminated.That said, I think Peter Jackson did a great job in putting together a movie experience that is altogether believable and involving.  I was disappointed when the movie ended both times I've watched it.  From my point of view, it is a rare movie that is able to assemble such a great cast (each and every one of them is superb), establish realistic locations (for fantasy and sci-fi, that is increasingly rare), and have music that stirs the soul and puts emotion right where it belongs.I'm one of those people who put the ""fanatic"" in ""fan.""

With the untrustworthy Gollum as their guide, anything could happen before they are able to accomplish their goal. And who will survive the great battle? Both Merry and Pippin have been recruited for unlikely military positions, and the beautiful Eowyn is determined to make her stand on the battlefield as well. None of the Fellowship is free of danger in this final, awe-inspiring battle to save Middle Earth from the wicked eye of Sauron and his Ring of Power!Based on the renowned books by author J. R. R. Tolkien, ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is the OSCAR WINNING finale of a three-part fantasy epic that is mindblowing to say the least! Director Peter Jackson, surprisingly coming from a no-budget splatter film background, brings the world of Middle Earth to fantastic and astonishing reality! Intense detail in every aspect of the filmmaking process has resulted in a trilogy like no other. It is difficult to single out performances here, for every cast member is perfection. However, much acclaim for this final installment is given to actor Sean Astin in the powerful and emotional role of Samwise Gamgee, best friend of Frodo Baggins. Sean's performance is tremendous and propels the struggle of Frodo and the Ring to an astounding level. Of course, this is not to take away from Elijah Wood's brilliant portrayal of Frodo or Viggo Mortensen's as Aragorn. I'd also like to add that Sarah McLeod, who plays the tiny role of Sam's love-interest, Rosie Cotton, is absolutely adorable; probably my favorite female in the saga. In addition to the outstanding cast and direction, the visual effects are flawless, the music is inspiring, and the settings are incomparable. The great attention to detail results in a medieval world that, fantastic as it is, seems 100% real. The creatures are amazing, the battles are astounding and intense, and at the heart of it all is a message to never give up and never underestimate yourself or others. This is filmmaking at its finest. Can any one film of the trilogy stand alone as a viewing experience? Yes and no. The films are each fantastic and plenty lengthy, though there is never a dull moment, but they are unquestionably all one single story. They must ALL be seen consecutively and in order (though you don't have to watch them all in one day). This Widescreen, 2-disc edition of the DVD presents the film as it was released in theaters, with a beautiful widescreen format and a fine collection of extras that include: 2 ""making-of"" featurettes and a wonderful National Geographic special comparing the Lord of the Rings saga to real world history, 6 short web-featurettes, theatrical trailers and TV spots, a ""supertrailer"" for the entire saga, and a video game preview. No mention of the special ""extended edition"" DVD this time around. That's right, some time after the release of this theatrical edition, extended editions of the already lengthy films were released on DVD. Those must be REALLY long, and they probably have some great extras too; maybe the audio commentaries or production art we don't get here. Regardless, even Peter Jackson refers to the theatrical releases as the ""preferred versions."" So, make your choice. You might even feel like owning both versions. Any way you go, you can't lose; An AMAZING film saga, and this final chapter even won Best Picture at the Academy Awards! A fantasy film won Best Picture!In the past, there have been animated versions of the Lord of the Rings and the preceding tale by J. R. R. Tolkien, ""The Hobbit."" You may want to discover these for yourself. I can't wholeheartedly recommend them, as I haven't seen them since childhood, and I recall the animation being a bit weak to say the least. Still, it's been a long time, but don't expect them to come anywhere near these versions. Also recommended for ""Lord of the Rings"" fans: The Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Legend, The Last Unicorn, The Princess Bride, The Sword in the Stone, Excalibur, Dragonslayer, Merlin, the Harry Potter series, the Star Wars saga (still my favorite film series, but I'm a longtime fan), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Willow, Clash of the Titans, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, Army of Darkness, Fantasia, Braveheart, the Patriot, and I'm SURE I'm forgetting many more. Also, check out the stars of the Lord of the Rings in some of my all-time favorite films: Sean Astin in ""The Goonies,"" Elijah Wood in ""The Adventures of Huck Finn,"" Christopher Lee in the Hammer Dracula films, Ian McKellen in the X-Men films, John Rhys-Davies in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" and Orlando Bloom in ""Pirates of the Caribbean!""

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	APIW11UEPKIC2	"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ..."	I would have called it the greatest DVD ever but platinum rolls off of the tongue nicely.We all know about the movie.  I didn't like the 3rd as much as the 1st and 2md but the overall entertainment value goes way up in this one.  One of the problems I had was how Denethor just shows up with the palantir at the end without really explaining anything at all that happened with the palantir and him.  I mean he says a couple words before the fire but they should have at least hinted at the fact that he had a palantir.  Overall though a great adaptation of the book that really could not have been any better.The extended and deleted scenes are 40+ minutes on this one!  Saraman returns, we get to see the mouth of Sauron, this is the best ever special edition for a movie.  It is a Lord of the Rings fan absolute dream.The 4 seperate commentaries are contunied.  Once again the four hobbits and the rest of the cast continue to be very entertaining and informative.  The director and script writers commentary tends to be boring but is very informative for book fans.  For book fans also the great 3 part 90 minute Tolkien biography continues. Explaiing the book from script is great also.  It would be computer overload to tell all about the rest of the special features that are at least 4 hours long not to mention the 14 hours of commentary tracks on this movie alone!One special feature that really stood out for me on this one was the Horlelords documentary.  It was very touching and one part you won't believe when they had a charge of 200 horses and one of the front riders fell off and horses that should have been running him over for  at least 2 minutes manage to dodge him and he hardly gets a scratch on himself.Seeing the new special editions that are coming out with the theatrical release and the extended edition leaves me feeling a bit jipped.  I mean, why coulnd't they have put that on the platinum edition?  But I really don't care, I had seen the movies at least 10 times before this thing finally came out and I would never have the desire to watch a shortened version different from the one I know and love now.	5.0	Platinum baby	2006-10-18	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2OVSCJO1PNM8N	Morpheus	"It's not about ""purism."" It's about consumerism and a culture brought to its intellectual knees.People who have never read the books (or who don't read books, like Dubbya, our idiot king by another title) will probably enjoy this extended version of Return Of The King. Its original eloquence and grandeur has been sufficiently reduced and elsewise dumbed down so as to accommodate the average modern viewing audience (read: generic McPeople: average reading skills/mental level of about 8th grade development).However, those who have an appreciation for good storytelling set to film will find Peter Jackson's LOTR Return Of The King to be lackluster and disjointed at best - but certainly an extended special effects extravaganza to be sure. This is what happens when a gaggle of irredeemably mediocre screen writers and other sundry simpletons get their intellectually challenged and rather unwashed hands onto a work of genius. They find the bigness of such works offensive, so they have to reduce it down to their own toady perspective. And thus we have Peter Jackson's masterpiece of plebianity, The Return Of The King, Extended Edition.Remember, for a film about a story of the length and complexity as such LOTR Return Of The King is to be successful, or more precisely, for it to be popular (consult Roget's Thesaurus regarding synonyms of the word ""populace"" and ""popular""), inexorably required it to be presented in a butchered form; substituting special effects and poorly written, incongruent scenes, each snatched wholesale from the thin air betwixt the educationally impoverished ears of Jackson's maladroit staff of mudlarkean screenwriters. Elsewise the sad fact of the matter is that without the shamelessly stultifying advertising assault to promote this low browed adaptation of Tolkein's works, the legions of American consumers would not so sheepishly flock forth to gleefully view/purchase something so sloppily slapped together as Peter Jackson's mass mediafied magnum opus, the parody known as The Return Of The King.You wanna make something like Tolkien's works ""accessable?"" You also want to make sure it is a money-making powerhouse? That's simple: Just let some Hollywood morons loose to vulgarize it, and you've got yourself a winner!Thus, in all honesty maybe it would be more appropriate to rename the film. It should be called ""The Return Of The King, For Dummies."""	2.0	Return Of The King, For Dummies	2004-12-07	75	10	65

One of the best movies I have seen in my entire life. When I viewed it on January 29, it was my second time seeing the movie in theatres. This story is about survival, friendship, good, and evil. This story takes place in Middle Earth. It is about the adventure of a hobbit named Frodo and his best friend Sam, who is also a hobbit, who are trying to get to Mount Doom to destroy an evil ring. This is the third and last movie in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. The special effects are amazing like all of the other movies. Even though it is a very long movie, it went past very fast. I was totally glued to the screen the whole time. Some little children might be scared of the violence, but I think it is really up to the parent to decide whether or not to take their child to this movie. I don't want to say much more because I want you to check out the movie for yourself. This movie without a doubt deserves five stars. There were absolutely no flaws during the whole movie.

Fowler ""ben1283"""	Since the Lord of the Rings trilogy began two years ago it's had people on the edge of their seats, and now it's finally over.  When 'The End' appears over the final reel you're left completely flabberghasted, astounded and satisfied.  Return of the King is proof positive that Peter Jackson is one of the most exciting and imaginative directors around at the moment.  The movies have already gathered critical and audience acclaim over the world, despite a few bitter reviews.  The truth is that there hasn't been anything to rival The Lord of the Rings since Star Wars.  The Matrix fizzled out, and Harry Potter seemed so obsessed with sticking rigidly to the words on the page (though in fairness, Chamber of Secrets showed a great deal more spark than The Sorceror's Stone).It's pretty pointless to map out the story, it's already been grounded by two movies of well over three hours each (if you're watching the extended versions).  What remains so impressive is that Jackson can handle the epic and the personal so deftly, swooping away from his characters in the magnificent battle scenes and then back in a headlong collision course for the close-up.  Various characters are improved upon in the third film, notably Merry and Pippin's friendship and Eowyn's love for Aragorn.  All of the actors involved really come into their own, with Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood and Miranda Otto deserving particular mention for roles that deserve to be nominated at this year's Oscars, but will no doubt be overlooked.  The movie's full of moments that will make a lump rise in your throat, keeping you on the edge of your seat and alternatively on the verge of tears without ever going over the top.  Put simply, this is rousing stuff!Though it would be foolish to say the film is perfect, it wouldn't be an exaggerration to call the vision on a whole a masterpiece of modern cinema, something that will be remembered for years to come.  It's epic on the big screen and completely pulls you in, even more so than the first two of the trilogy.  A few critics have labelled the ending as badly handled and it's true that it drags somewhat, yet it's also true that the removal of the novel's The Scouring of the Shire chapter fits the overall feel of the movie well.  Most of all though it just seems like niggling to pick at the parts of the movie that weren't as perfect as we might have liked them to be.  Basically this is where it all comes together, and you can tell here more than anywhere just how committed everyone was to the films and how much they enjoyed making it as the majority of viewers enjoyed watching them.  Finally, The Lord of the Rings will go down in history, and deservedly so.	5.0	The best	2003-12-26	3	2	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A179GX8E3M4G52	"Mr D. ""Artist/Designer/Kibitzer"""	Yes, I know I'm, breaking tradition and writing a review that is destined to be one of hundreds of 5 star reviews, which in all probability will not be widely read but write I must.For those of you who have skipped the first two movies (I can't imagine who hasn't seen the first two) and figured you'd catch up on the finale, do yourself a favor and rent or buy (you may as well buy because you'll buy eventually), &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, for you will surely be lost if you don't.Lord of the RingsThe Lord of the Rings trilogy is a classic Good versus Evil saga. The Dark Lord Sauron, a maleficent creature, who was once thought to have been destroyed, resurrects himself in the temporary form of an evil eye and rebuilds a malevolent empire consisting of various kinds of evil creatures and ultimately plans to unleash them on his neighbors. Purpose? The annihilation of humanity. To this end, he is assisted by the mighty Wizard Saruman, who once was a force for good but because he believes Sauron cannot be stopped throws his lot in with his evil, once enemy.This evil is countered by many heroes, some who give their lives fighting Sauron's hordes. The story revolves around a lost ring, one of several, but the most powerful, which was created by Sauron to conquer and enslave humanity in Middle Earth.&quot;One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them. One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them&quot;I must stop and explain here that humanity in Middle Earth consists of Man, the immortal Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits (diminutive manlike creatures with rather large feet). They are confronted by evil creatures which include Orcs, Trolls, Uruk-hai (vicious Orclike creatures made from mud), Ringwraiths (once human kings, now all powerful Sauron lieutenants) and various and assorted other creatures, the likes of which you have never seen.The Return Of The KingThere is so much to tell here I don't know where to begin. Gollum plots to lead Frodo and Sam into a trap with Shelob, a giant man eating spider. Sams hears parts of the plan as Gollum talks to his wicked other self and confronts Gollum who twists things around on Sam and makes Frodo believe he is the danger.Gandalf finds out that Sauron plans to attack the Gandor, fortress city of Minas Tirinth and hurrys to warn the Royal Steward, who is insane and grief stricken and will not undertake the defense of the city. Finally Gandalf usurps his authority and starts to organize a defense.In the meantime, with Pippens help and without the Stewards knowlege, Gandalf manages to light bonfire beacons and send word to Rohan of Gondor's plight and Rohan's King Theoden rounds up his army. Aragon is with Theoden and together they realize that Rohan's six thousand men at arms will be pitifully small against the combined might of Sauron's dark armies.Enter Elond, known to some as agent Smith but thats another story, who hands Aragon the rebuilt sword that destroyed Sauron two thousand years ago and implores him to take his rightful title as King Of Gondor. Yes, Aragon, our hero, is a descendant of the Kings of Gondor.If things are getting complicated, stand by. Elond strongly suggests that the only hope to defeat Sauron's army is to go into a haunted mountain, into the Paths of the Dead and get the spectres to honor a pledge they broke in antiquity.Gollum springs his trap on Frodo and he's cocooned by Shelob but Sam, who had been sent away saves Frodo but before he could free Frodo, Sam has to hide from approaching Orcs.Will Aragon recruit his mystery army? Will Sam free Frodo? Will their Quest succeed? I invite you to see the movie.ConclusionThe actors were great. After three movies you really get to appreciate these guys and gals. Despite the morose subject matter, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan tended to lighten things up with comedic antics and tongue in cheek humor. Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen had the parts of a lifetime and they ran with it. And for me, a great part of the movie was Sean Astin's portrayal of Sam. I am disappointed that at least one of them was not up for an Oscar but you know the Acadamy.Do I recommend this movie? If I've yet to make that clear, let me say this. I know this movie is not for everybody and you know who you are. For the others this and the two predecessors, each individually and collectively are the real greatest movie and story ever told.	5.0	Six Months later, 11 Acadamy Awards and I Still Love It	2004-05-29	3	1	2

After an ever so slight let-down with the extended version of the Two Towers, this movie not only brought back the excellent pacing of the first extended film but it added some wild plot twists and storylines as well.This movie did a great job of tying everything together and unfolidng the rest of this incredible epic.  There were crazy battles, profound moments of humanity, and everything in between. The bad guys were REALLY bad and the good guys were REALLY good which made for some serious tension.  Each character was revealed to their fullest and in most cases you could feel their pain and joy right along with them.The ending was pretty dramatic with an added twist that you will certainly like and probably not expect.  Alls I can say is that by all means you should see this film to wrap up one of , if not the greatest trilogy ever created.Oh yeah, Of course there are a FEW tiny things that were not perfect so like a good reviewer I have to spell them out:- Not enough Good guys get killed off.  Too often, they seem dead or you think that one of them might die.... but they only miraculously get out of trouble or come back to life.- The ending did drag a bit, especially in the extended version but what the heck.... not a big deal.Otherwise, this is one of the few films I have evr given 5 stars to.EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED!!!	5.0	Fantastic film, GREAT ending to a superb trilogy!!!	2006-03-31	4	1	3
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3361C04XA3KM6	"Mr Money-Bags ""Slayer of Sacred Cows and Grou..."	"Review for Return of the KingFirst off, this movie made no sense. They don't bother to introduce anyone or tell us what is going on. Maybe this would have made more sense if I had seen the first two movies. But come on. You can't use that as an excuse, movies should stand ALONE ON THEIR OWN MERITS, and on its own, this movie doesn't make any sense and nothing is explained. I mean, who is going to take the time to watch all three of these movies? That's like 11 hours!I seem to be the only one to notice this, but this movie is a total rip-off of Star Wars. I mean, come on, really. It makes the movie almost embarrassing to watch. The Ring is just like The Force. Sauron is the Emperor, and Saruman (good guy gone bad) is Darth Vader. Brash, cocky Aragon was modelled on Han Solo, and Frodo is Luke Skywalker. They replaced the lightsabers with real swords, big deal. And that Gollum guy is an Ewok if I ever saw one. Think about it, he leads the Hobbitts around like the Ewok leads Leia around. Coincidence? *Snort of derision* Yeah right. Mount Doom is the Death Star. The Orcs are like the Stormtroopers. And in the biggest chutzpah rip-off of all, Gandalf is clearly based on the popular character Yoda. I mean really. Did these people think they were going to get away with it? I could go on and on with the evidence, but I think what I've presenting is conclusive enough. So for originality this movie gets a big zero. Even the locations remind me of Star Wars.Thirdly, the casting is inept. Elijah Wood, the kid from the Macaulay Culkin movie ""The Good Son"" as Frodo? Har har. Mikey from the Goonies as Sam? Viggo Mortensen from GI Jane fame as the dashing warrior? I mean, whoa, the casting crew must have been on acid or something.Fourth, the much-talked about special effects. It's difficult for me to watch a movie with such special effects. In all the sweeping shots of castles and fortresses, you can see how badly pixelated everything is - I mean come on. I was making better CG models on my Amiga and Apple II in the 1980s then this stuff, and it's more than 20 years later? Haven't we learned anything in this time? Apparently not. And that guy dressed up in the Gollum suit... wow, just wow. During one shot I saw the zipper on it, and I buried my face in my hands and almost wept.Fifth, the dialogue is about as cheesy as you can get. ""We must fight, to save the world!"" Uh, okay there Thor. *Insert golf clap here* There are also many cliches taken from the Dragonlance book series here. It's shameful, simply shameful.So, all in all, I must give this movie 1 star out of 5 possible."	1.0	Simply no good.	2004-04-14	297	22	275

Frodo's character played by Elijah Wood was phenominal laying bear all the raw emotions of one so young and facing all that life could throw at him with his ever faithful friend Samwise Gamgee by his side to both witness and bear his friends struggle with the Evil hanging both around his neck and infront of him in the shape of the clearly demented Gollum, who was waiting to destroy them all at any given time. The others Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and friends also on there own colision courses with destiny and danger battling the Orcs and Saruman, Aragorn doing inner battle with his undying love for Arwen and what is right for his people and all others depending on the defeat of Sauron. A superb cast all greatly suited to there roles and characters doing much justice to a great film trilogy. A big shame non of them were ever nominated for Oscars although very worthy all of them in my opinion.	5.0	LOTR Return of The King extended edition	2007-07-10	4	4	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1S4SB7VPQBEDN	Mrs. N. Niaz	Watched it in cinema. The experience itself was great. I am shocked that Newline are releasing the movie sooner than usual ( LOTR FOTR and LOTR TTT were released in August). I was happy and surpried that The Return Of the King sweeped the Oscars winning 11 Oscars, but I feel bad that they didn't put the Oscar logo + Best Picture Of The Year on the DVD Front Cover (usually movie distributors put the logo to tell that their movie won so and so oscars). Ah well I am not going to buy the theatrical version as I am going for the extended one. I hope they put the oscar logo on that 1. It is sad that the story has ended and youll get up and say, man why did it end so soon.Then youll remember that well they cant take out a LOTR movie year can they. Anyway there is talk in Hollywood that Peter Jackson is gonna make THE HOBBIT, prequel to LOTR. It is expected in 2007-2008. So atleast there we will something from LOTR to wait anxiously for.	5.0	An End To The Saga!	2004-03-15	5	1	4
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AFPQVUEI3D46K	"Mr. Stanley M. Schmidt ""boymitch"""	"You know a movie is well made when three hours twenty minutes feels like two hours!  This movie brought all of the elements together to create a masterpiece: graphics/cinemtography, music, storyline and emotion.  I'll let others review the actual storyline, but I'll give you my favorite movie situations and critiques.Favorites: 1)The first view of Minas Tirith!!  How could you not be impressed with this fortress in the mountain.  It's ten times grander than the mountain fortress, Helm's Deep, of the second movie - simply breathtaking!  2)The ""Mist and Shadows"" song sung by Billy Boyd during the Steward's son ride to certain death to retake the garrison outside Minas Tirith - now that was an emotion message of a son willing to die to make his father proud.  3)Rohan's princess heir fighting along side her father.  4)Viggo Mortenson's performance overall - could they have a cast a more appropriate actor to carry out the role?  5)Ian McKellan's performance as Gandalf was simply brilliant.  6)Legolas slays one of the huge mammoths, but it ""still only counts as one!"".  Who wasn't laughing during that line??  HA!!  ...and finally 7)The superb animation of Golem - that, in itself, is a technological marvel.Least favorites: 1)The UNDERUSE of Orlando Bloom and Liv Tyler.  These characters played such important roles in the first two movies and were really underutilized here.  2)Elijah Wood's performance in general and the ongoing, continuing, repetative, tedious, neverending DAZE he was in from being weak and under the Ring's ""control"".  His co-journeyman, Sam, had to keep snapping him back into shape.  If I was Sam, I would have thrown him off the cliff and been done with the whole thing.  &lt;snicker>  3)The ending, that drug on and on...Bottom line: The is an AWESOME TRILOGY!!  I am so antsy for the Deluxe, Special Edition that will contain a 108 hours of extra footage and wrapped in a hand-carved mahogany, numbered, autographed box...ha!!  You don't that could happen?  Look at the millions they've taken and tell me they are not marketing geniuses!!!!"	5.0	Fantastic finale to the trilogy with only a touch of tedium	2004-01-08	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3HA0A92FVYHOF	"Mr. Tickle Snort ""Mr. Ticklesnort"""	"Do you ever feel that you've lost your appreciation for movies?  Have you given up on the whole sci-fi/ fantasty genre of films, thinking that it requires a child's imagination to appreciate them?  I thought so myself  And then came Lord of the Rings; The Return of the King.It's rare that a film can be three and a half hours long and leave you wanting to see it again the very next day, and then the next day after that.  But this film does!  Yes, the film is a dazzling visual spectacle.  But sheer spectacle is meaningless (as evidenced by the most recent Star Wars films).  This film  resonates with us all, because it demonstrates the importance of friendship, as well as endurance through even the darkest of times.When the ring finally meets its doom, the audience feels the emotions of  Frodo, Sam and Co.; you feel as if you've reached the end of a long, arduous journey.  We have been led from a happy, small shire, through an ever growing darkness and despair.  The evil is finally defeated, but things never return to ""normal.""  The ending was much better than I expected; the loss of human life is minimal for our heroes.  However, there is still a sense of sadness and tragedy; the cost isn't in the form of life, but of oneness with one's homeland.  Such emotional impact is rare in most movies' endings; most films usually opt for a dark, depressing, ending, or a finale that is sentimental and silly.And the actors deliver surprise after surprise.  Viggo Mortensen is unbelievable as the noble, valiant Aragorn.  I say ""unbelievable"" because he has a reputation for playing scumbags.  He has definately displayed a wider range with Aragorn's character.Then there's the other actors who are (normally) insubstantial (ie Elijah Wood, Sean Aston, etc.).  Their fine performances under Peter Jackson are proof that actors are only as effective as the people directing them.On all fronts, this film is an unforgettable masterpiece."	5.0	An Awe- Inspiring, Mind-Blowing Epic	2004-01-06	2	2	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3S1UN5UL0W2G6	Mr. Wright	I have loved these books for such a long time and when I heard they were making them into movies I was excited and scard at the same time, but when I saw the Fellowship, I knew they had done it right.  In my opinion all of the movies should have won the Oscar for best movie, but since Return of the king did, it feels like all of them won the award since it is one movie.  Best movie I have ever saw, to all of those that said the ending was terrible, it is the way it should have ended, since from a door in Hobbiton the whole story began in the Hobbit.	5.0	Great end for a Great trilogy	2005-04-29	9	7	2

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AP50P603W4BA7	"Ms. H. Sinton ""dragondrums"""	This extended edition of 'Return of the King' has an extra 48 minutes added and they have been so skilfully inserted you would think they had always been there.A welcome extra is the scene where Sauraman is confronted by the fellowship and, although defiant to the last, is finally defeated once and for all, it ties up what was a loose end in the theatrical version. The drinking competition between Gimli and Legolas is really amusing and both actors make their roles so believable throughout. The little 'asides' they make to each other give some comic relief to what could so easily have become a dark and bleak film.Sure, the films are not identical to the books, but Peter Jackson has produced a masterpiece of a trilogy and has introduced a lot of people to the books who may not otherwise have read them. Purists may not be happy but the majority of LOTR fans will love this extended version. The collector's edition also has a polystone 'Minas Tirith' keepsake box and an additional DVD of Howard Shore's LOTR symphony. This collector's edition is well worth spending your pennies on and highly recommended a brilliant finale to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.	5.0	Brilliant finale to the trilogy	2005-02-12	8	8	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A25HC5NQ6JSHUZ	musashi_333	I don't know what all these people are raving about.  Return of the King sucked.  Granted, the movies are much better than the books, as Tolkein was a linguist not a novelist, he didn't know how to write fiction and compelling sequences.  All I'm asking for is a little sense from you people.  Grown, (hopefully) mature human beings.  I mean, come on. That scene where Legolas takes out the oliphant ( not an elephant, mind you ) is totally absurd and ridiculous.  If you like that, you might as well start worshipping the Wachoski bros who gave you such beautiful and also such mindless action scenes as are featured in the second and third Matrix installments.  The time spent on Legolas, and also on the stupid carry-over joke of Gimli and Legolas's body count competition from The Two Towers could have been spent on more interesting things, such as the conflict between Gandalf and the crazed steward, or detailing some of the amusing incidents from the book where Samwise and Frodo take on orc clothing and start a mini battle of their own between to different factions of orcs.  And, lest I forget, how could you insane ninnies ignore the horrible editing in the last 10 minutes of the film?  You must be descended from ostriches and love to hide your heads in the sand when you see crap like that in something you want so desperately to love...I mean, the first hideously, perversely long fade to black as Frodo and Sam are about to be overtaken by lava...the second repetitive, onerous long fade to black after you think most of the loose narratives are tied up...the fade to white...AND STILL THE MOVIE GOES ON!!! To cap it off, we need to have yet another End-of-the-movie-Speech by Mr. Samwise Gamgee!  It's useless.  The whole affair makes any decent bipedal hominid with opposable thumbs and a fair sized frontal cortex want to sign off on the human species as a whole and let the rest of you wights stumble about in mud and your own feccal matter till Sol goes supernova in a few billion...Oh yes, one more thing.  The Lord of the Rings is not a trilogy.  A trilogy is a group of three INDEPENDENT works, related by theme, characters, subject matter, etc.  You can look it up.  The key word being independent: I dare anyone one of you to honestly believe that you can read any of the three books and NOT NEED to read any of the others to complete the story line. (I double dare you to do that with The Two Towers.)  The Lord of the Rings is one work, which just happens to have three freaking parts.  The same goes double for the movies: One work, three parts.  Much like the Holy Trinity, if any of you yahoos might know what that is.	1.0	Sense and Insensibility	2004-08-30	45	8	37

I knew there were two possibilities- it would either blow me away, or it would ruin the series for me.I should never have doubted Peter Jackson.After the first two incredible parts of the series, ""Return of the King"" managed to outdo both of its predecesors.  This film combined the amazing battle scenes of ""The Two Towers"" with the moving character work of ""Fellowship of the Ring"".  It deserved every one of the 11 Oscars that it won (the first film to get more than 10 nominations and to win each of its nominations).  The special effects are incredible, and Sean Astin really shines in his role of Sam.If you liked the first two films of the series, and if you liked the books, this film should be a real treat for you, just as it was for me.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A50W7ZVTG606	"Naomi Tilley ""Story Buff"""	I've followed this epic trilogy virtually from the first rumours that some brave soul was going to attempt to film a live action version of The Lord of the Rings.After psyching myself up (sufficiently, I hope) for the potential disappointment of certain key elements being left out, I have to say that I am looking forward to seeing The Return of the King even moreso than when I was awaiting the release of the first Harry Potter movie. And anyone who really knows me will know that is saying something.I have conceded that certain things are going to be left out, as happened with the first two films. Though this is pure speculation, I believe that the scouring of the Shire, the hobbits' final trial, will be abandoned from the film adaption.The good news is that Aragorn's journey through the Paths of the Dead will NOT be left out.There is so much to look forward to - primarily the final stage of Frodo and Sam's journey into Mordor, and to Mount Doom, and the Free People's final stand against Sauron.The latter promises to be an even more spectacular sight than the siege at Helm's Deep in Two Towers.I live in hope that Mr Jackson will conclude his wonderful work by wrapping things up cleanly with all the main characters, but still staying relatively true to the book. Even if we have to do without the scouring of the Shire, I think most Tolkienites will know what I'm hinting at.I won't say anymore now. It's one thing to speculate in general terms, and another to try and predict exactly what we are going to see, come the release date in December. And, it's been bugging the hell out of me that some reviewers are trying to do just that.I will wait until I have actually seen the film before I write anything more, and I hope it will still deserve the five star rating. I think it will, and that's a prediction I will make with reasonable confidence.	5.0	5 stars just for the anticipation...	2003-08-17	9	3	6
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2WI60KUWZ3GO8	Natasha	I thought that Return of the King was the most emotional of the trilogy. It really made me cry! I was even more suprised when i saw the guy in front of me weeping! He was about 18/19 and he had tears running down his cheeks! (honest!).I enjoyed myself completely, and towards the end of the movie, i was actually wishing that it will not end (even after three hours and i was DESPERATE to go to the loos!). I knew that if the movie ended, then what would i look forward to at the end of 2004? The trilogy was a phenomenon! Twenty years from now, when i have my own children, i could just imagine my future son being obsessed with all things LOTR :the book, the movies,etc., just like how i was when i first saw Star Wars in 1996.My favourite scene was the one with Eowyn in it. I admire Eowyn because she had the courage to be different. She refused to be stereotyped into the role of a woman, and she followed her heart, even when all around her said NO. I was pracically cheering for her when she was in the battle scene, when trying to protect Theoden. She's definitely my heroine in LOTR!My hero, Legolas, did not make much appearances in the third installment. Nevertheless, Peter Jackson, got Orlando Bloom to do his stunts and that satisfied me a lot! By the way, I LOVE the outfit that Legolas wore at the end of the movie!It's so unique and so prince-ly.Anyway, if you've seen the former two, you'll most definitely going to see this one. But, if you haven't, catch up by watching the extended versions and treat yourself to Return of the King, the last but definitely not least!	5.0	My Favourite Among The Three	2003-12-26	3	3	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3SQYXZEI7BAO4	Nathan A. Foy	I remember in 2003 when I just was on the edge of my seat waiting for this movie to come out.  Having read the books several years before and having seen the first 2 movies I couldn't wait until this came out.  My high expectations were not let down at all as this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I now watch the extended version, which is about 4 hours long.This movie consists of the huge battle at Gondor and the final battle fought at the gates of Mordor while the two hobbits Samwise and Frodo make their way across the darkest parts of Mordor to Mount Doom aka Amon Amarth to rid themselves of the ring.  This movie is full of action while the two sides battle.  Gondor seems hopeless as they are being overrun by goblins, orcs, cave trolls.  Will Rohan make it in time to divert the enemy from bringing down Gondor?  The witchking that no man can kill leading the armies against Gondor, how can one that no man can kill be defeated?One of the advantages of the extended edition is you get to see what becomes of characters such as Eoywn and Faramir which is only hinted to in the theatrical version.  For me this was a very important part because these two characters seem to be ones who have struggled with much suffering throughout the movie.  Oh, speaking of Eoywn, she is told not to go into battle...but...well you know how Eoywn is if you saw The Two Towers.The story of Gollum, Sam, and Frodo intensifies as Gollum seeks to turn Frodo against Sam hoping to lead Frodo into a trap.  By the time Frodo realizes what is going on, it may be too late.I could go on about how great this movie is and if you liked the first two, you will not be disappointed with this one.  It is not only action packed but plays well with the characters' inner turmoil such as Faramir continuing to win his father's approval where his father would just as soon have him go out in the battle field and be killed.  There is enough humor in the movie to make a person laugh but it isn't overdone to the point where it takes away from the story.There are all sorts of meaning that can be made from this movie.  First, those that are opposed to Sauron must overcome their own differences from within in order to truly win.  Rohan doesn't want to come to Gondor's aid because Gondor didn't come to their aid.  Aragorn is struggling to claim a throne that is rightfully his, which he must do in order to give Gondor an advantage against Mordor.  The underlying theme is that people must settle their differences to obtain a higher purpose.  In life people are often divided on what they believe or their world views but these differences need to be set aside in order to improve upon the world we live in.  We need to seek the inner king or queen within us all instead of oppress it.  Only then can we succeed at accomplishing our goals.The acting in the movie is excellent and very realistic and the graphics are amazing, from the amazing scenery of Gondor to Gollum's facial expressions.  Highly recommended for those who like fantasy and epic movies with a strong meaningful story line.[...]	5.0	"""Certainity of Death, Small chance of Success, What are we waiting for?"""	2012-12-09	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1C7BWPATO40VA	Nathan T.	"The third and last part of the LOTR Trilogy is the end set of this huge and massive movie divided into 3 sections. I watched all 3 movies in the theater and have only rented the first for home viewing as it is my favorite of the 3. The other two weren't as good for a few reasons of my own if not for some others as well. What I thought funny was that they released each one through a setted time period, each one a year or so apart, even though all 3 were already finished from the beginning from what I heard.The movie opens up as the continue of the Two Towers(Part 2) where Frodo and Sam(short for Samwise), played by Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, are both being led quite blindly by Gollum(Andy Serkis) into the very intricate lair of Shelob, a monsterous, giant, ancient arachnid-type monster that lurked at the stairways to the firey mountains of Mt. Doom, eating almost anything that might pass along her way, even the orcs(indigestions...use pepto :P ). Of course I'm not here to ruin the movie for those of you that haven't watched it so the rest is for you to find out.The problem that I saw with this movie, if most of you haven't noticed, is the shallowness of the film. Its depth and heart isn't as strong as the first and in my opinion has lost it since around the period of the second part of this trilogy, the Two Towers. Pictures, sounds, acting, and directing were all good don't get me wrong. The flaw I saw(rhymes) I guess came first from the book itself as this movie was book based. I felt that the movie had good action and once again a whole lot of graphically generated armies of soldiers and orcs and others at war, but what made it demeaning is the thought in my head ""wow...this again?"" In other words, I thought the battle was a cheap way of impressing the audience. It was pretty much the same as the one in the Two Towers in the fact that it showed two massive armies of the so called ""good and bad"" slamming into each other in the havoc of war and bloodlust. After viewing so many films, I'm more impressed by the quality of the fight than the numbers in it. Once again, you see the same kind of fighting technique, Legolas(Orlando Bloom) shooting his arrows at the orcs and Gimli(John Rhys-Davies) chopping away. Its boring after the second or third time around.Throughout the second part and this, I felt like they were rushing through the movie a little too much. I mean have you seen the whole book? I've read the whole thing and wow is it boring. Its huge, even with 3 hours you cannot possibly fit so much into 3 or so hours. The problem wasn't the one fact that they missed some scenes that the book had but movie didn't, it was the fact that they missed the dramatic moments that made LOTR...LOTR. Movies like this should not be rushed. This was another reason why I didn't like the Two Towers much, but loved the first one. I just didn't feel the same soul in the movie as I once did in the beginning. Again I don't want to ruin the movie, if the others haven't already, so you'll just have to watch to find out what I mean.The biggest problem I had was the horribly elongated ending. I know its in the book, but wow!! I know I wasn't the only one in the theater that was saying ""END IT ALREADY"" or ""WHY IS IT STILL GOING?"" I was shaking my head slightly throughout the whole period and people were sort of giving each other awkward looks that have a question mark written all over it. They should definately do something about it.That done, there are a few minor problems, but nothing else to be note-worthy. Most people who start watching LOTR should minus well finish it. This movie isn't the kind of ending I was hoping, but I suppose it was satisfactory in the most part. Watch it anyways. Good day everyone. Note: Is it just me or does Sam seem a little TOO attached to Frodo."	4.0	At Last The Long Awaited Ending To This Massive Movie	2005-08-10	1	0	1

Watching the extended version of the film, I felt somewhat relieved that PJ had in fact shot the film acurately, and the producers cut it down, leaving out many small, but important features.  All the same it was an excellent film that on its own, and with its two earlier films will take a long time to top.Having a lot of the film literally filmed in my back yard (example the scene in LOTR: FOTR - the forest where the hobbits hide from the Nazgul) - Mt Victoria.As a proud New Zealander I encourage all Kiwi's to buy part of this history.	5.0	Hollywoodisation - Yeah right mate!	2005-01-30	6	0	6
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1A6PZ25GTBRIG	"N. Chodoba ""arrbogast"""	I approached this extended edition of Return of the King with more enthusiasm than the other two extended editions because of the information that 50 minutes were added to the film!  This was more than a fan of the books and films could have hoped for.  There is so much added in the extra footage that sets the mood for the film much more concretely right from the get go, that I was completely enthralled all over again like I was when I saw the film in theaters.  I think that there is no one who will dislike the additions; they are extremely well incorporated into the flow of the film.  What follows is a review of the extended cut of Return of the King (the first two dvd's).  I have not watched the appendices but am sure they are phenomenal as well.Now for some spoilers.  Smeagol and Deagols sequence is a bit longer and more intense, The Saruman sequence is worth seeing, because we did not really get closure to his storyline in the theatrical cut...  It is good to see Christopher Lee as Saruman and Brad Douriff as Grima Wormtongue one more time... It makes sense that Lee was upset that his part in the third film was cut for the theaters, it is a great final scene for the character, and is integrated here.We get extra details about the decline of Gondor, well worth it..  We also get more Palantir scenes (one extended with Pippin, and a brand new sequence with Aragorn).  There is a scene with the Witch King and Gandalf that just blew me away, as well as The Mouth of Sauron at the gates of Mordor, a tense moment in the books, and here reinserted for fans...  There is an extra scene with the Dead army.  In addition, there is some extra development of the romance that Faramir and Eowyn will share (like the books) which was only shown in one scene in theaters at the end when the two appear together in frame. We even get a very small Boromir cameo!!!The extended sequences are integrated so well it is hard to see when the theatrical version ends and the extra footage begins.  But that is besides the point, this is a reworked version, and includes the theatrical version and 50 minutes of new footage for a total running time of over four hours! Even new music has been integrated!!!  Now we all can go and watch the three extended cuts as one long film and enjoy the experience all over again... Peter Jackson has outdone himself again.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	Peter Jackson's awe inspiring adaptation of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to a close with the Return of the King.  Picking up where Two Towers left off, ROTK up's the ante for everything set in the previous two films; ranging from the ultra epic battle scenes (the battle of Helm's Deep from Two Towers is nothing compared to the warfare here), superb makeup and special effects, and amazing acting from everyone involved.  Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are close to concluding their quest to destroy the ring in the fiery depths of Mount Doom, while they are led by the deceitful Gollum (Andy Serkis) who has plans of his own.  Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) accepts his role in the kingdom of men while he, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Gandalf (Ian McKellan) endure the never ending onsalught of dark lord Sauron's forces.  Undoubtadly the best film in the Lord of the Rings film series, director/producer/co-screenwriter Peter Jackson and his crew have crafted something truly special here.  ROTK deservedly won every Oscar it was nominated for (including Best Picture and Best Director), and the surprising and amazing emotional depth from the actors (Astin and McKellan especially) has to be seen to be believed.  Roles of returning cast members, including Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Bernard Hill, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Hugo Weaving, Miranda Otto, David Wenham, and Karl Urban, are more limited here, but their performances, along with the screenwriting of Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens, are to be comended.  All in all, ROTK solidifies the prediction made before the first film was released: this will be and is a film series that will be cherished for generations to come.	5.0	&quot;We've come to it at last...&quot;	2004-05-27	5	5	0

In the Return of the King, we find the movie that reigns supreme over this years many films. This supreme film is truly a jewel in the crown. The film wastes no time in getting started, starting off first with the history of Gollum, before going to the Ring-bearer's quest, and then onto Gandalf and company, who prepare for Sauron's ultimate attack upon the great city of Minas Tirith. The battle is phenomenal, Frodo's quest is epic, and the whole movie a triumph of imagination. My only problem with it was that it was rushed, and there was not that much talking about other things than ""the great battle of our time"".

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A278VZJLHLMNNT	Neo	"I loved the whooooole Trilogy, and I have to say, I hadn't really known about Tolkien and his work until these movies came out, and I believe that it was The Return Of The King that REALLY got me into Tolkien, and into reading in general. Its amazing, how one man, one mind can produce such a wonderful,rich, detailed and marvelous world like he did. Its truly amazing. I will never be able to comprehend how he did it, much like peter jackson. I cant believe what masterpiece's some people can make in this world, its simply beautiful and brilliant. We have only God to thank for that, who gives these wonderful gifts and talents to us, and obviously he was with Tolkien while he wrote these books (he was a big Catholic or something i believe, lol), and with peter as well. GREAT JOB ALL OF YOU!!!!!I LOVE YOU ALL FOR MAKING THESE BOOKS AND FILMS!!!lol.Really though, I wish i could go to Middle Earth, of which I know many of you also would love to live there in Hobbiton, and The Shire. Ever since I saw the Shire in 'Fellowship', i just wanted to live there, with Sam, Merry, and Pippin (though i dont know if I would see Frodo there, because he would be in the Grey Havens most likely) and all those cute Hobbit girls, lol. It makes me sad at times, seeing our world and how screwed up it can be at times, but as long as we're in Middle Earth in our hearts, we will always be there. And hey!, i got my Extended Editions and Books, so i can go there whenever i want!!lol, but truly, i believe that our earth isnt so far from Middle Earth, and I think many people will agree with that (Hitler as Sauron, or even Bin Laden, and the Orcs are the Mindless, Moralless Terrorists whom if I were Aragorn would swipe them off this Planet!!) But for me, i will always live in Middle earth, and i believe that out of every Race in Middle Earth, I am a hobbit, a little bit of all four of the Hobbits we know (wink), and i cannot wait till the Extended Edition for The Return Of The King comes out, and from what i hear, a nice Collectors Edition with a Minas Tirith Collectible sounds great!! But now I wish i got the other Collectibles' Versions, like the Fellowship one with Falls Of Rarous stone kings collectibles, but not so much the Gollum one for The Two Towers, hes just way to creepy for my taste. I mean, hes an amazing creature on film, but in reality, man hes just CREEPY!!lol. But anyway, brilliant movie, amazing book, and I will always treasure them and keep them close to my heart. I recommend The Extended Edition for this Final Installment for the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even when its not out yet! but see, its THAT good. The last two Extended Editions did not dissapoint me, and this one will be definetly be the Crown Jewel of my Collection. What I REALLY hope for is the scene where Sarumans Staff is broken. OOO I can see it now, just like in the book, when Gandlaf puts up his hand and using his mind strength in what will hopefully be a powerful moment, He says 'Saruman, your Staff is broken"", and then a powerful 'CRACK!' and Saruman screaming and stuff. That would be soooooo cool!! Anyway, thats my review for this wonderful movie AND book, they are superb."	5.0	Tolkien and Jackson, what a TEAM!!	2004-08-14	1	1	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	Rare is the movie that one can say has everything.  Hollywood used to produce these during the 1960's; classics like Ben-Hur, Cleopatra, Spartacus, and The Ten Commandments.  But even these pale to the 4.5 hour epic that is Return of the King.  The latter has everything; comedy, romance, action, suspense, drama, a great soundtrack, incredible cinematography, unrivaled special effects, a grand cast, and of course; a happy ending.  Unlike other epic movies, this one contains numerous scenes that are of a  climactic quality; whether it be the Ring's destruction; the triumphant charge of the Rohirrim on Pelennor Fields, the lighting of the torches from Gondor to Rohan, or even Faramir's charge at the behest of his father.  The entire movie makes for an incredible emotional roller coaster.  And unlike its two predecessors; this one did get Best Picture, along with 10 other Oscars; all of which were well deserved.Now that I have heaped the praise, lets point out what could have been improved.  First and foremost; for the length of the movie; it leaves out a lot of important material from the book.  Better for the story and for the critics to include everything from the book, and brake it up into two separate movies.  Conclude the first one with the death of Theoden, and include Sharky's (Saruman) conquest of the shire.A second letdown was Faramir's defense of Osgiliath during the invasion of Sauron's army.  It was portrayed very poorly.  From the Fellowship of the Ring up to this point, one gets the feeling that Boromir was the swordsman who preferred intimate conflict while Faramir was the archer who'd rather act from afar.  Yet when Faramir prepares his men to repel the Orc amphibious invasion, he has his men take up swords and fight on ground level.  A more appropriate defense would be for the men to take refuge on the rooftops and decimate the invading orcs with arrows; nearly all the Gondorian soldiers had bows and arrows.  They would have lasted a lot longer, and might have even repulsed the invasion.The third major failing was Aragorn's triumphant entry onto Pelennor Fields with the Army of the Dead.  It seems as if the orcs just line up to be killed by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.  This contrasts greatly with every previous battle scene where the orcs are quite vicious and skilled in combat.But for all its failings, this is probably the best movie released this decade; and by far the best movie to be directed by a non-American.  My favorite part of this movie was its soundtrack.  It is quite rare for an action movie to have memorable singing parts; this one had two.  The first is by Merry in probably the most haunting scene of the movie.  The second is by Aragorn on his coronation.  Legend has it that both actors came up with the music themselves; a proud achievement for both of them if true.  All in all, a great movie, a great DVD set, and a must own.	5.0	Almost perfect	2008-03-06	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1LJFKIZ15WP32	Nicholas Doles	Like the previous two extended versions this adds scenes and story that would have made the movie too long for the average film watcher but were sorely missed by fans of the novels.You get to see Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman at the tower of Orthanc, but you don not see Saruman in his cloak of all colors. You get to see Aragorn confront Sauron through the Palantir of Orthanc and his confrontation and slaying of the Mouth of Sauron before the black Gate.They have also extended many of the previous scenes including the journey through the Path of the Dead and you get to see the romance of Eowyn and Faramir.The only major disappointment for me is that there is still no cleansing of the Shire. I understand why it wasn't done, but I am still greatly saddened.The other bonus discs are also up to their usuall excellence. While they would not be my reason for ever buying a special DVD, it is interesting seeing how they brought Tolkein's dream to life.	5.0	A Fan Must	2004-12-29	2	2	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2WMPYQA0VDO3H	Nickibockers	"I may be the odd one out, but I liked the theatrical version somewhat better. Despite choppy edits in the TE, it wasn't as rushed or harried as this Extended Edition felt. The editing here in the EE is still less than good, compared to the first two EE versions, whose flow created a glorious literary feeling. ROTK-EE chops and jerks from scene to scene and dialogue flow stutters, painfully pointing out that many more scenes in between are absent. It seems the more they added back in, the more we noticed what was still missing.Instead of a smooth transition and easy flow (like the very nearly flawless FOTR:EE), the scene transitions moved lightning fast - jump jump jump - with no thought given to the poor audience trying to soak up the vast amounts of information and action being chucked our way (wait, please, PJ!! let me revel in that moment!).While still undoubtedly the finest treatment of Tolkien's masterpiece, Jackson gives us both an achingly gorgeous creation, unfortunately mixed with a few frustrating deviations.The wonderful Healing scenes were ""blink- oops you missed them"" fast and the  development of the beautiful, pure and innocent relationship between Faramir & Eowyn cut short, if not cut off (though the feeling of innocence remains). The healing of Eowyn - cut to exactly 1:30 minutes. The healing of Faramir? Non-existent. And the ad nauseam additional scenes of Gollum could easily have been left out. The whole ""Smeagol lied!"" bit made me want to puke. By the time they reached Mt. Doom I'd so had it with Gollum I could have killed myself. PJ really over emphasized his character and it seemed like he was rubbing it in our faces at this point.It's a dream come true to see the novel realized, and many of the added scenes were glorious, don't get me wrong, but it certainly felt like PJ just THREW in the other scenes (some, badly-chosen) to satisfy his eager audience in order to call it an ""Extended Edition"".Some were downright amazing: the resolution of Saruman - With the hectic and sometimes tedious pace of the battle scenes to follow this confrontation is actually a nice breather! Merry's monologue to Eowyn was very lovely. I really love the little touches like these that PJ added back in. I loved the addition of Eomer finding his sister on the battlefield along with the transition into the Houses of Healing when we see Aragorn healing Eowyn, but again, it was cut down too much.The problem of omitting the majority of Eowyn & Faramir's relationship is that it makes the whole building up of Eowyn & Aragorn utterly useless. If you're not going to have a resolution to previous areas of the plot, don't over-emphasize it in the first place.To leave out the resolution of these ""other"" characters cuts into the dignity of PJ's hard work. I was angry to get more Gollum and more of ""Gandalf explains to Aragorn what to do"" and less of these ""minor character"" development scenes. Peter Jackson in adapting, of course, had to change many points of view to better develop his characters for those unfamiliar with the books, but he seems to have tried too hard to TELL, instead of show. Things were spelled out and dumbed down a little too much, creating too much unnecessary repetition. Things weren't as bad here as they were in TTT:EE (""Sauron is using his puppet Saruman to destroy Middle Earth"" or the like, was said no less than THREE times!).Also, cutting into the dignity of the film is humor applied at inappropriate places, such as Gimli continuously being the butt of jokes. It seems that Jackson had nothing better to do with this character - and especially Legolas's - and changed their relationship entirely, giving them a more ""modern"", bantering relationship. When watching some of Gimli's scenes, I was pained that PJ wrote such things into his script. A little more restraint would have been better, and turning to his original source a wise idea, instead of creating something new to ""please the audience"". The comic relief against the background of the horror of battle is placed by Tolkien in the two young Hobbits, and there it should remain!Other lackluster points include blase Legolas stunts, the over-dramatising of Aragorn's destiny (just get on with it!), and the lack of explaining Denethor's madness (a 30-second explanation is so easy: show him whipping out a Palantir, explains the ""I have seen much"" hint and boom!, madness explained away and potentially forgiven). Otherwise, he's just another bastard who favors his older son, dignity compromised. His character is still great, but the Palantir ought to have been included here.Scenes like ""The Last Debate"" also still continued to slightly disappoint - the lack of other peoples contributing to the final decision to march upon the Black Gate really left me wanting, and really missing Imrahil! He also could have easily been placed into the story and explained in 30 seconds, and his importance created in one line ""this is Faramir's uncle"" generating an ""Ooh! we like Faramir. I bet his uncle is just as spiffy!"" audience response. And, oh, dear LORD, Legolas' ""a diversion"" takes the cake as far as utterly stupid dialogue goes. Oh well.With the Mouth of Sauron: yes, we all felt like doing that to the MoS, but his trap was so sneaky and dastardly in the book, I was sorry to lose it. It seemed like a cop out.And WHAT happened to the horses at the Black Gate? PJ's ""additions"" ruined the continuity! He had a wee bit too much fun romping around in Middle Earth and forgot to fix the things he messed with. Makes the fact that ""this is a movie"" all too clear, unfortunately, and sometimes, you really just want to soak in the fantasy!I still felt like I had ADHD by the time the movie ended. Of course, this doesn't mean that I wasn't bawling like a baby by the end of it, crying because it's over, crying because this film was amazingly glorious, despite its flaws. Good job, overall, Peter Jackson! Whew. What a ride it's been, eh?Stick around for the hours of extras. They do great justice to PJ's film. The pieces on adapatation & creation, and the bio bit about Tolkien's life particularly are fabulous."	4.0	Too Little, Too Often...	2005-06-12	19	13	6

Pikey	I have this to say... if Tolkein himself had been around to oversee the making of these films, then I would expect a faithful adaptation. But these films (and ROTK in particular, since it omits much more than the others) are Peter Jackson's interpretation of Tolkein's books. If you believe that this film is SO lacking due to the missing storylines/climaxes that are present in the book, don't watch it! I would think that such avid readers (who love and appreciate the BOOKS as Tolkein's masterwork) would be intelligent enough to view the films as totally seperate entities from the books, and appreciate the FILMS as Peter Jackson's masterwork.	4.0	TO THOSE WHO CRITICIZE JACKSON'S WORK WITH 1 OR 2 STARS	2004-11-24	20	11	9

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2QW2X50XBAFEI	NIUengl103	Return of the King is by far the best of the three films.  While they are all great films, Return of the King just seems more emotional and it includes the final ending that everyone is waiting for.  The acting in all three films is phenomenal, so by the third film it seems like you've known the characters for years.  Though the film is long and there are parts of it that are slower than others, I still seem to be on the edge of my seat through it all.  Watching all of the characters go on their separate journeys all to meet in one place in the end is worth watching.  Also, the choice of music adds to the mood of each scene.  The music is great and it really makes you feel what the characters are feeling.  I have never read the books, which may take away from what I think or say about the films, but I do believe Return of the King is one of the best films ever created.	5.0	LOTR: ROTK Review	2005-10-04	4	3	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	"In scale, ambition and extensive use of the latest CGI digital effects, director, Peter Jackson's ""The Return of the King"" effectively brings to a close his awe-inspiring adaptation of J.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings.""  Tying up the loose ends: Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) prepare for their massive battle at Minas Tirith; Frodo's (Elijah Wood) mission to Mordor grows more dark and sinister as he nears the molten lava of Mount Doom; Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) confronts Gollum in the most compelling and subtly nuanced digital manipulation. There are a couple of curiosities, including the inexplicable absence of Saruman (Christopher Lee) who will appear in the extended version DVD at a later date, and the reduction of several roles that were previously rather weighty, to mere cameo status.  Jackson had a lot of ground to cover in this final installment and his editorial acumen was working overtime. The film is slick and polished, masterfully told and faithful to Tolkien's vision.  Still, ""The Return of the King"" does tend to suffer from too many endings in its attempt to be loyally inclusive to all of the characters.THE TRANSFER: Stunning. No less was to be expected and no less is offered in this beautifully rendered picture. Truly, there is nothing to complain about in this anamorphically enhanced presentation. Colors are stylized, bold, rich and vibrant. Contrast and shadow delineation is nicely rendered. Blacks are deep, rich and solid with an incredible amount of fine detail present, even during the darkest scenes and battle sequences.  The audio is 5.1 and extremely powerful. The rich musical score sweeps across all audio channels with an enveloping presence. Dialogue is very dimensional.EXTRAS: As with the previous two films, this one comes with a host of extra features, including three substantial documentaries (the National Geographic one being the best) and six extremely short ""featurettes"" which  play more like extended trailers for the film.BOTTOM LINE: Is this the BEST PICTURE of last year? Arguably, yes. It certainly is a fitting conclusion to the trilogy and an exceptional DVD presentation for your home theater. Add this one to your collection today."	5.0	TRILOGY'S END HAS EPIC SWEEP AND STUNNING PICTURE QUALITY!	2004-05-25	1	1	0

However, to my great pleasure, I discovered that one of the added scenes in this extended Platinum Edition adds greater tension to this film, renewing my love for this amazing work of art. Let me add that there are aspects of this film that improve through watching the film with the director/writer commentary on. I found myself being less disappointed about the content left out of the movie from the book and more moved by the story and especially the longer-than-expected ending. Ultimately, this third installation of the movie trumps the first two, which is saying a lot. After reading the book, and having watched this final extended edition, I am certain that I will never forget these characters. My appreciation for the story increased greatly by being able to experience the original movie and extended edition, and be a part of the obvious love for the story that the artists who put this movie together have for it. I can't recommend the extended editions enough and particularly loved this one. With an extra 50 minutes, which can even be appreciated by those who have not read the book, and with the amazingly low price Amazon offers on it, this is a no-brainer. You must have this movie.	5.0	Extended Excellence	2005-01-05	3	3	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A12FLZREV32JOP	Noelle Eiram	Each movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy ends with a bang. On their first viewings, I was a little shaky in my enjoyment as the movies began. However, somewhere in the middle of each film, I realized that I was completely immersed in the story. The Fellowship of the Ring has an emotional climax. The Two Towers concludes with spine-tingling action sequences. And it is safe to say that the culmination in The Return of the King is both stirring and touching.The very end of the Return of the King is more similar to an epilogue of a novel than a movie. Though there is much in this film, the filmmakers take their time in developing some scenes. The soundtrack eloquently mixes much of the music in the first two films and adds a few beautiful melodies. Acting is first rate, perhaps even better than in The Two Towers. This movie has its small share of Hollywood moments, but is completely redeemed by its general faithfulness to the book.The Return of the King is a beautifully made and fulfilling finale to the remarkable Lord of the Rings Trilogy.	5.0	Incredible Conclusion to a Mind-blowing Trilogy	2003-12-23	4	3	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ASE5HYTOQI8NT	nonconformist_no14354	Lord of the Rings: Return of king was a must see for me, being quite a fan of the first two films. Well after I saw it...well I was slightly disappointed. It was very good but it was missing something that the first two films had. I can't quite put my finger on it. There were several things in this movie that had an impact on the suspense. For example:-The major battle of Minas Tirith was supposed to better than Helm's Deep but there was not as much fear or suspense as Helm's Deep. There are two reasons for that, it rushes into the fight (the suspense is the wait not the battle) and the scene had split focus which confused the audience emotionally. Helm's Deep was good because it was building up to the battle and you got to see the fear of the defenders.-What ever happened to the original of the book? The ending of movie is very different.I guess with this film there was too much to put in it. Another thing that annoys me is that everyone including Peter Jackson seems to think friendship and courage and things like are the main themes. They are and they aren't. Isn't the story about the ring? Isn't the ring a symbol of power and temptation?	4.0	It was very good but.....	2004-01-06	7	2	5

Since blu-ray tech came well after the release of the DVD special extended edition release (250 Min), one would think Peter Jackson would only re-release the superior special extended version in the stead of the theatrical edition? Bottom line, he didn't. So why would Mr. Jackson make this release of the shorter version instead? Well to fool those consumers who would think that the blu-ray would naturally have the extended version. Thus those foolish costumers (my hand risen, as one of them) will end up buying both versions, Theatrical and the more aparently impending to be later re-released Special Extended, separately on blu-ray... pretty ef'ed up, but true.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AMOOD7BSBIBXY	"N. Saiz ""Norma Saiz"""	Myself, along with millions of other viewers, was captivated by the first film in the Lord of the Rings series. It was an amazing accomplishement in filmmaking and a huge visual gem for the eye. The third film, and sadly the last, couldn't have sumed up the emotional struggle of the fellowhip any more better or complete than Peter Jackson did. A true marvelous achievement this conclusion was to a more marvelous series. Frodo and Sam continue thier rough journey across jagged rocks and vast lands of no hope along with the character that made the second movie worth while, Gollum. I loved the beginning there they showed the past of Gollum, once known as Smeegle. It was an excellent start to fill questions about Gollum that some were pondering. It was very hard to search for any mistakes in this movie of perfection. Frodo grew more and more attached to the ring and it showed at the end that the power of the ring can transform anyone, even an innocent Frodo. Gollum kept himself as innocent as possible by blaming everything on 'the fat hobbit', otherwise known as the lovable Sam. Aragorn, Orlando, and Gimley, Gandalf, Merry, and Pippin's quests all continued on the gruesome land of battle. A hopeless senario between millions of skull bashing orcs and Trolls against a mere several hundred men. But hope strides forth when more and more armies join the men to defeat the power of evil. I couldnt have asked for a better ending than this movie was. Peter Jackson without a doubt deserves the Acadamey Award for Best Director after 2 nominations and this movie DEFINITLY deserves to win Best Motion Picture. A visual thrill ride and amazing effects made this movie a house-held name and a box-office success. I dont think there can be anyone who hasnt fallen under the spell of Jackson's magic with this gem of filmmaking. This movie is grim, raw, and the best fantasy thriller EVER. One cannot surpass this delicious boul of rapturing amazement. Sadly to say (and no surpirse to devoted fans) this will be the end to the series of a movie that will go down in history. No series has ever been capable to pull together three seperate marvels (all who had much success) into one piece of awes, oos, and I cant believe...But you should believe that this is the best to be presented.	5.0	An excellent conclusion to an excellent series..	2003-12-23	4	4	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A22PV91A5CNOGO	"NY film buff ""A reader from NY, NY"""	Peter Jackson and Co. have done some very nice work, and The Return of the King is a treat to watch. The New Zealand landscapes, in particular, are spectacular; the images of signal fires on the mountains between Rohan and Gondor are wonderful to see. Of course the costumes and other accoutrements of the dwellers in Middle Earth are handsome as well. Unfortunately, the dialogue doesn't live up to the visuals; PJ and Co. should have stuck to Tokien's words instead of reinterpreting them. The CG battles become a little repetitive and tedious; some characters, like Legolas the elf, are given even less to say than Clint Eastwood in the days of his wild west sagas. Elijah Wood's woefully pained and anxious expression remained constant from the beginning of the film until the destruction of the Ring. The writers' transformation of Denethor was particularly dreadful; instead of the strong but flawed individual created by Tokien we are given a raving, dribbling lunatic. However, all flaws aside, this is high entertainment, and a good way to spend a rainy afternoon.	4.0	Good fun, great visuals, but the book is way better	2004-07-21	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3NQ1I8NGZW96L	Nys04	"When one talks of the all time great movies, the Godfather Trilogy (well actually the first two), Schindlers List, Saving Private Ryan comes to mind.  Now, add to that list the Lord of the Rings Movies by Peter Jackson.  In fact it would be rude, nay, disrespectful to Prof Tolkien,if the entire three movie were not taken as one long 11 hour epic and judged based on that alone.Return of the King (ROTK)continues the story immediately where the last movie left off about two little Hobbits' quest to destroy the evil One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor.  In the meantime, the humans are preparing for round two of the obsession by the evil Sauron to wipe them off the face of (Middle) Earth.  if the battle at Helms Deep at the end of movie two set the future standard for battle sequences in film, the battle at Palennor Fields completely blows it away and redefines the mark.  To many fans, this theatrical release is but an extended trailer for the inevitable [back aching] that is the Extended Edition that is slated at Christmas time.  But this release is no slouch either clocking in at an incredible 200 minutes long.Video Quality:I have to admit at being worried that some compromises in quality had to be sacrificed to fit the entire movie on only one disc.  However, the transfer was absolutely pristine and simply puts some of the other movie transfers at half the length to shame.  Incredible.  All said, there was some blurring in the fast moving battle-scenes but you'd have to be a pick-wit to notice.  Reference quality.Sound Quality:Like the previous two releases, the movie comes with Dolby Digital-EX surround and it absolutely rocks, my movie room was a earthquake zone when the movie was over.  Lots of low frequency rumble will have your neighbours keeping 911 busy.  All in an excellent sound field and sound transfer.  It remains to be seen if the DTS version in the extended edition can top this excellent offering.The Extras:I have to admit that I was a little disappointed at the offering in disc two where the extras are housed.  The extras contained two documentaries which only newbies will really get excited about and a national Geographic special comparing LOTR characters and situations to real life events and characters like William Wallace and Benjamin Franklin etc.  Missable.  There are a few web featurettes and an introduction to the coming video strategy game by EA.  Perhaps the BIGGEST disappointement is the absence of the music video of the Oscar winning song ""Into The West"" by annie Lennox.  How hard can it be to put in a simple music video to complete the offering.  If I were rating the extras I would definitely give it a 2 out of 10.  Having the music video could have redeemed the lacklustre offering.  But considering that I am getting my hands on the DVD two months early, its a small price to pay, although I feel that they should have put in the music video.Roll-on Extended Edition."	5.0	DESERVES MORE THAN 11 OSCARS	2004-05-28	1	1	0

A classic for the ages has been created here. I can't think of another film series that made such heavy use of computer generated special effects, yet, had acting of such a high caliber that it wasn't overshadowed. No, perhaps it didn't live up to the letter of the original trilogy, but it certainly lived up to the spirit.I think people needed an inspirational tale of courage, honor, and quest in these times. People hunger for a time of true heroes and true kings. People want to believe that great men will still give their all for their kingdom, their country. People want to know that oaths will be honored no matter how hopeless the situation. People want to know that light and good can overcome darkness and evil against seemingly overwhelming odds. This film gave them all of that and more.I can't wait for the DVD to come out.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A13FBTZ8SO8T3D	o dubhthaigh	"First off, this IS a GREAT Movie, a terrific cinematic accomplishment that even in this truncated theatre release (the extended, better film will be out for next holiday's shopping) will leave you breathless, wonderstruck and amazed. Jackson did a great job in a lot of the details. The actors were really convincing all the way through, the cinematography awe-inspiring and the effects set altogether new standards. Howard Shore's score is beautiful, one of the best for any movie ever.However, did the finale here really get Tolkien's point. Well, kinda. In the clutch, what holds this back from 5 stars and what ultimately settles the quality of the series is that Jackson seems caught in the crosshairs of the effects of geeky computerism, and the affectations of Ranaissance Faire speech patterns. Tolkien did not write that way. Who would have guessed that a Kiwi would have been time warped and trapped by the images of an Anglo-Saxony that never was, and lives only in places like Reading, Pa? What happens repeatedly throughout this film is that High Pronouncements are uttered to telegraph major upheavals in emotional and ethical terrain. It is an act of extraordinary hubris by Boyens and Walsh to think they could have written better development and dialogue than Tolkien. Tolkien was after the question of why there was evil in the world (especially in the context of 2 world wars) and what happened to the innocent when they had to come to terms with it. The Philosophical and Ethical issues were also tied in with the dilemmas confronting environments of all sorts: inspite of Jackson's Disney-fication of the Ents, in his own way Tolkien was posing Heidegger's question concerning technology, which at the time, and perhaps even more so in this age of ""smart bombs"" and stupid presidents, was made manifest in the fascist directive to conquer the natural as well as the political world. In the course of the books, tragedy drives the drama and the metaphysics, real tragedy. In the scope of Tolkien's tremendous gifts, it was his unique power to make fantastical creatures convey on a very human level the dilemmas that their world crises were presenting. That's not really what comes across in the films, although they are in fact really entertaining movies.The end of the books deal with death and the prospect of the spiritual tradition of an afterlife that was central to Scandinavian and Christian cultures. Metaphorically it was a sort of reward for the sacrifice innocence made for blood it spilled in coming to terms with the knowledge of evil. In the film, it is quite sentimental, and you'd be hardened bugger not to get misty-eyed.For my part, a little less special effects and  a bit more of the grist of the story would have made it a categorical triumph. It is, for all my quibbling, an astounding achievement. Truth is, I'll watch this film over and over, especially when the real version comes out next November, gleaning ever morsel I can out of it.Best Actor? McKellan. Best supporting actor? Any Serkis (there would be nothing to the computer stuff if Serkis had not gotten it perfect). Best movie? Clint Eastwood's MYSTIC RIVER.

I thought most of the scenes were great especially the The Voice of Saruman.  This was a great addition and should have been put in the theater edition but that's okay.  In the Company of Orcs was another great scene along with the Mouth of Sauron.  The scene were Aragorn masters the palantir is okay but not too great. Yet again Peter Jackson added another scene with Arwen in the palantir but that's not a big deal.  The other scene where the Witch King breaks Gandalf's staff is kind of annoying----- that never happened in the book---- but again, it is still an okay scene.  The battle sequences were added to with lots of fighting goodness, and the Houses of Healing are a great addition too.  This is only some of the new stuff, but the rest is of the movie is great.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1KXZVCLSNKC2I	Opinionated	"This movie is no ordinary movie - it is a filmmaking achievement of the highest order.  Even if you don't like fantasy stories (and I'm not a huge fan of the genre), you will be drawn into the story of this film.  Never mind the CGI and special effects - you'll forget that it's fiction, because the human struggles at the center of this story are so real and relevant for all times that you'll be moved, as I was, to tears during this movie.  The story presents the familiar clash of good vs. evil, with kingdoms pitted against one another, striving for power - but the director here is so skilled, that the focus remains on the characters and what drives them.  The choices they make determine the destiny of the world, and ultimately they are the ones who decide whether the world will be engulfed in evil and death, or redeemed through faith and courage.The central storyline involves the journey of two Hobbits, Frodo and Samwise.  Frodo is tasked with carrying the One Ring, a tool that was forged by a great evil and has only the power to destroy; however, its master will be the ruler of the world, although the world will be engulfed in death and destruction.  No one is able to resist the dangerous power of the One Ring, and therefore Frodo must carry the ring to Mount Doom (an active volcano), where it was forged, and the only place where it can be destroyed.  Frodo's temptation to secure the ring for himself, which is compounded by his physical deterioration, and forced flight from enemies who are seeking the ring for themselves, drive the story.  Frodo's humble friend and servant Samwise accompanies him on the journey.  Sean Astin, the actor who plays Samwise, should have been nominated for the Oscar - he's that good.  We learn by the end of the movie that Samwise has the heart of a lion.  He keeps his master Frodo on task, as any good servant does, but his willingness to risk all to fight for goodness in his small slice of the world, has ramifications for the entire world.Another character-driven storyline involves Aragorn, the unacknowledged heir to the Kingdom of Gondor.  Aragorn as the rightful heir could command great armies (including a supernatural army) in the fight against evil, but he is hindered by the weight of generational failures.  He will have to make a choice to assume his true identity and risk repeating the failure, or live out his life in anonymity as an unknown warrior.The director (Peter Jackson) is immensely talented and tells the story in epic fashion, without sacrificing plausibility, or sympathy for the characters.  He puts many of his fellow directors to shame, even the most gifted of his contemporaries (such as Ridley Scott, whose forays into action-and-adventure are top of the line - Alien, Gladiator - but pale in comparison to this film).The acting is first-rate.  Sean Astin, as Samwise, gives the performance of a lifetime (although you hope he continues to be given blockbuster material in the future).  Viggo Mortensen is perfectly cast as Aragorn, the reluctant King whose ambivalence about his destiny doesn't come off as wishy-washy or cowardly, although it might have in the hands of a lesser actor.  Miranda Otto is very sympathetic as Eowyn, a warrior princess who is the fulfillment of a prophecy in the film.  David Wenham shows his depth as Faramir, the cast-aside younger son of the delusional Steward of Gondor, who sends his own son to certain death on a suicide mission.  Such tangential storylines involving supporting characters make the film come alive, rather than detracting from the story (a tribute to the film's director) and give the uniformly excellent cast robust material to chew on.I loved this movie.  I'm not a fan of the original material (J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy), which I found to be slow-moving and unfocused.  If you love great filmmaking and love great stories about why it's important to stand up to evil, this rare film is for you."	5.0	A Filmmaking Achievement of the Highest Order	2011-03-06	1	1	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2URA8V35MBWI6	Optic eye	The animated creatures special effects work is very well done in CGI. Still,I lament that all is made with computor images, and not through stop motiontechnique using real models. A computor image can be very realisticallymade, but still lacks a certain something, a sense of realmanifested mass and presence. One of the last great stop motion creaturesused on screen was the dragon in the movie Dragonslayer; is was veryadvanced and had a computorized mechanism called Go Motion to give itcarefully adjusted movements. Here the computor had, as it should, asupporting role, instead of totally taking over. It is a pity that thisbranch of effects work was abandoned for the less costly CGI. Because theuse of a model gives by itself a sense of presence on the screen, that can'tfully be achieved with the illusion of the computor image. A real modelbrings an actuality of sharpness to movements, forms, colors, lights andshadows. The continuation of the Go Motion technique would have been aninvestment for the future, and led to many interesting discoveriesin anatomical and engineering mechanics, developed the knowledge of hard andelastic complex materials, and would have been a major factor in theadvancement of robotics. Instead the film industry exclusively chose, forfinancial reasons, the less costly road of doing make-believe illusionswithin the computor.	4.0	The creature animation.	2006-03-22	7	1	6

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AE03WS2GERIQF	Parity	Like the other movies in this series this suffers chiefly from being too long. The entire saga, whilst taken from three fairly long books, has been transferred to the screen in a fashion that just does not require this amount of time. For example, how in a movie that lasts over 3 hours do we manage to completely avoid seeing Christopher Lee's Saruman? Instead we get a tree dictating what happened and are rewarded for this cut with a truly dull end sequence that just drags on and on. They couldn't give two minutes to Saruman?Unlike the previous two movies there are moments of genuine excitement in this one, as if sitting through the first six hours allowed them to ground all the elements well enough to actually get on with telling the tale. The CGI feels less intrusive and the acting is largely good.Unfortunately, the grand combat sequences are plagued with acts of strategic stupidity never before seen on film. Why do Faromir and cohorts wait for half the invading orc army to pass them thus being trapped in the middle? Why charge a herd of oliphants? Hoping to scare them were they? Why not circle around them and attack from behind? You've got horses, it won't take too long. And what on middle-earth suggested to Aragorn that taking all his bests fighters to be surrounded by an orc army was a good plan? Ok, he's intending to create a diversion but why not keep a few choice fighters back if you have no intention of nor chance of winning this particular fight? What are you going to do if your diversion is wasted? I guess in middle earth no one had heard of Thermopylae. At least the Spartan diversion allowed the bulk of the Greek army to escape to fight another day. Aragorn's diversion is forcing a conclusion now. I think I'd be on that 'second' last (as in last for the second time) elf ship out with a king like that.However forgiving I am about these sequences, and they are fun if illogical, ultimately the lack of a real villain is telling. I'm afraid I just can't get that enthused about an enemy with less presence than an anorexic troll with a magpie complex. The spider is far and away the best 'baddie' in the show. Evil lighthouses just don't work.	2.0	Better but still too long.	2004-06-23	6	3	3

The war, the action, the menaces were startling, scary &amp; very fine. - How did they do all that?  The best feature of this -to become a classic- is the attention paid to the love, sacrifice and nobility of the heroes, both female and male - and for each other.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1BA72K4VK1UN1	"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster"""	"The three *The Lord of the Rings* films [all directed by Peter Jackson] have clearly made film history, chiefly due to their marked overall excellence. This film trilogy, shot entirely in New Zealand, is breathtaking at a minimum. Here, I'm reviewing the *Special Extended Edition* [as opposed to the much shorter Theatrical Version] of the third of these films on DVD, *The Return of the King*. It concludes the larger story on all fronts.I'm sure that the tale is familiar to most who would show an interest in this film but, for the uninitiated, the overall adult fantasy trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien chronicles a group of Middle Earth travelers which include a wizard, two men, a dwarf, an elf, and four hobbits, ergo: ""The Fellowship"". They are set upon this quest because two evil wizards have joined forces in an effort to eventually conquer and enslave all otherwise peaceful cultures of Middle Earth which includes Hobbits, Men, and Elves. At the behest of the pair of dark and nefarious sorcerers are the most dreadful orcs, trolls, wargs, and other heinous minions.At the outset [in previous films], one of the Hobbits [Frodo Baggins] has inherited a magic ring from an aged relative [Bilbo Baggins, ofThe Hobbit: 70th Anniversary Edition: or There and Back Againfame, a fantasy written by Tolkien for young people] and it eventually becomes clear that this is *The One Ring* which exerts full power over all remaining magic rings of power which still exist within Middle Earth. The One Ring was originally crafted by The Dark Lord [Sauron, the more powerful of the two evil wizards] but it was inadvertently lost for many years. As The One Ring [which can render one invisible, with certain negative caveats] ultimately ends up in the hands of Frodo, it becomes his crusade and his burden (along with the rest of The Fellowship) to destroy this ring at Mount Doom, a huge volcano which lies within Sauron's sinister and well-patrolled realm of Mordor.*The Return of the King* picks up the story after The Fellowship has endured numerous battles and other notable impediments to their objective. At this point, The Fellowship has broken up into multiple segments and all but the Hobbit Frodo and his devoted companion, Sam, band together again in a final effort to divert Sauron's attention from The One Ring so that the two Hobbits can surreptiously enter Mordor and destroy it. Two spectacular battles ensue and the action is non-stop.The advantage to viewing this edition of the film [as opposed to the theatrical version] is that the story makes a lot more sense, especially to those folks who have not read the books, (now available in a single edition:The Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Edition.) This DVD is significantly longer than the theatrical version.The trio of films broke tons of of new ground which was particularly in evidence as the cast and crew made a clean sweep at the Academy Awards for this final entry in the year of its release. The special effects were so sigificantly on the cutting edge of technology [chiefly enhanced by WETA Digital in New Zealand] that each film became superior to its prequel. *The Return of the Kings* stands today as the very hallmark of special effects technology -- it's so superb because all the characters and scenery look so realistic. No detail or necessary expense was spared in the making of this epic film.Howard Shore continued to write music for this movie which has helped to place it in such high esteem. His filmscore [available in its entirety here:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (The Complete Recordings)], coupled with segments of the soundtracks of the two previous films, are now available as a *Lord of the Rings Concert* such as this oneMusic from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, these being rendered by various renowned orchestras around the globe. Some arrangements of this music vary, depending upon the conductor and the orchestra. Shore used The London Philharmonic for the movie soundtrack.This film stands on its own. You could definitely watch and enjoy it without having seen the two previous films. But I would heartily recommend that you do view the other two in the order in which they were released:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)andThe Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition).While it was likely that Frodo [Elijah Wood] was the central character in the film, or perhaps even Gandalf the Wizard [Sir Ian McKellan], it is the stellar performance of Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn which eclipses them all. Still, this film is perfectly cast and that was clearly half the battle for Director Peter Jackson.As with the preceding two Special Extended Edition DVD sets, this boxed set includes two *Appendices* discs [four discs total, two for the film and the two ""making of"" discs] which cover every possible aspect of the making of the movie. They are infinitely well-done and are nearly as compelling as the movie itself.Do not miss this historic and magnificent film, even if fantasy is not precisely your favorite genre. Highly recommended above all others!p.s. -- If you as yet own none of the three films and you wish to purchase them as a single package, you can do so here:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)."	5.0	An artful and tasteful conclusion to the triology (details)	2010-12-20	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ARMVAHWQQ9S8A	"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand"""	"Ambitious in vision, epic in scope, and beautiful in execution, Peter Jackson's ""Return of the King"" is a fitting end to his adaptation of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy that is a magnum opus if there ever was one.  Everything that you loved about the first two movies are here--if you didn't love or see the first two, don't bother with this, because it's literally the direct continuation--though things in this one take all of that to the next level.  While the first two movies were entertaining and told great stories, they were largely build-up for the various climaxes that redefine the term ""catharsis"" of this movie.Jackson does a stellar job in adapting these acclaimed books into what may be the best fantasy trilogy of all time, ending it as nicely as he begun it.  The level of quality remains consistent throughout, and the level of attention given to each battle, each character moment, each bit of score (which, alone, was tragically beautiful), and each special effect is commendable.  Not only did Jackson do a great job of translating the book to work as a film, he also showed a large amount of bravery while doing so.  Many lovers of the book might have been disappointed with how Jackson tampered with the structure of the book (leaving out how Saruman took out The Shire in the book version, as well as restructuring Frodo, Sam, and Gollum's journey, moving the Shelob build-up and conflict to this movie instead of keeping it as a part ofThe Two Towers, but for me that just showed that he was willing to change a coupe of things to make this the best movie as it could possibly be--and his efforts paid off in large, large ways.Though I'm giving this movie a 10/10 because it is indeed a classic and deserves full marks, it's not perfect.  No movie is.  I thought that the ending employed too many fade-to-whites and fade outs, which tricked the audience many times over, making them think it was about to end.  If Jackson had just used cuts instead of fades, it would have been fine, but when he faded for the third time and the movie still didn't end, I find that most people who haven't seen it before actually laugh--and that certainly isn't what the end of the movie should do.  The battle scenes are a bit drawn out, especially the scenes before Aragorn and the army of the dead arrive.  Jackson could have achieved a more powerful effect if he trimmed two or three minutes off of the war scenes.All it all, it's as perfect a fantasy film as there is out there, and highly deserves all the acclaim it's gotten.  ""The Return of the King"" is a fitting end to one of the best stories ever told, and--despite it's length--it has high rewatchability.10/10 Classic."	5.0	Redefines Catharsis	2008-07-07	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1VA170GUYGTB	Paula L. Craig	A great film, not to be missed. The music is wonderful and the special effects are great. In some respects, the movie is actually better than the book; it gives Arwen a bigger role, and moves the story along faster. The cast is good. Orlando Bloom especially shines as Legolas. In the books Legolas is a surprisingly minor character. Peter Jackson was clearly smart enough to see he had a real find in this actor and gave him extra screen time.The Lord of the Rings films do a good job of harmless escapism. They also have a more serious message. Tolkien saw firsthand as he was growing up the destruction of the English countryside. This process has now progressed to the point where there is hardly a beautiful and untouched place on the earth, only teeming humanity as our population goes up and up. Is this really what we want? Is it making us happier? Seems more like the sort of plan Saruman or Sauron would have.The movie does have its faults.  I thought it was very strange that the orcs made a highly disiplined attack on Minas Tirith, while the defense was totally disorganized. Using trebuchets to throw rocks at the attacking orcs from the walls of the city as part of the defense struck me as simply silly.  Maybe I know too much about actual medieval warfare. The whole attack on Minas Tirith seemed a bit over the top to me.  How many hundreds of thousands of attackers do you need to make an assault seem exciting?As to the extra shots in the DVD, some were good, while with others I tend to agree with the original decision to leave them out. The scene with Sam and Frodo getting mistaken for orcs is so good that I find it hard to believe it wasn't in the original cut.  On the other hand, I thought the death of Saruman was hokey.  The goodbye scene at the Grey Havens, which was way too long even in the original movie, is now even longer here.The commentaries and documentaries do a lot of fawning over Peter Jackson.  Certainly the guy did brilliantly with these films, but the impression I get is that I'm extremely glad I don't work for him.  He seems like a world-class talent at spending way too much time at obsessing over the trivial, then trying to make up for it at the last moment by working his subordinates beyond the point of exhaustion.	5.0	Escapism plus	2006-02-04	4	1	3

It's funny though becaues the chance that the person reading this is some LotR nerd who has nothing better to do than go around and say all the 4 and below star rating weren't helpful in their purchase of the movie (even though they probably own it already) is probbly a 90% chance. I fell asleep during all three movies, and I'm a huge fiction/fantasy fan. These have to be the lamest movies ever. Read my sequel of the LotR trilogy if you want to here, [...] I also left a review on MSN if you care enough to go look for it. These are the most pointless movies ever. The concept is lame, the characters are annoying, and the story is dragged out to fullest extent. The hobbits must die, and so must the old wizard guy. I guess I should mention the never-ending ending of the movie. I counted 11 more scenes after I thought the movie was going to end (when Frodo and Sam get picked up by those flying things). I could see 2 or three more scenes, but eleven did it, and that's when I started to openly make jokes at the movie in the theater.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AFQWINGW8YHTC	"Paul D. Petroff ""Movie, Music, and Book Fan"""	"I am absolutely thrilled that The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King Extended Edition will be released soon.  I've noticed that some of the other reviewers have been complaining about various ""shortcomings"" of the intended release.  I am not one of those malcontents.  This entire trilogy of films has been a godsend to the millions of fans of J.R.R. Tolkien.  Peter Jackson has been true to the spirit of the books, and he has poured himself into creating a masterpiece of an epic story for the screen (he and hundreds of others, that is).Both my wife and I have tremendously enjoyed viewing each of the Extended Editions as they've become available.  It's almost like eating a favorite meal and finding that an even better spice or other ingredient has been added to improve the overall experience.  Each Extended Edition has added more backstory details and enriched the already fabulous tapestry that has been created in the films.As for all the hoopla about the Scouring of the Shire not being in the Extended Edition, some people need to understand that Peter Jackson was restricted by a budget within which he had to produce all three movies (remember, folks, that all three films were made at the same time, so he couldn't ask for more money on the basis of the first film's success).  Therefore, he (and the writers) had to make some decisions about what to leave out.  The Scouring of the Shire IS an important element, but it does not diminish the characters of the hobbits because it is missing from the film.  They still proved that, in the end, everything depended upon the little people--the powerful leaders certainly had major roles to play, but it was the small folk who ultimately overcame.  Anyone who sees the movie should arrive at that conclusion.I applaud Mr. Jackson and the rest of the talented individuals who labored to produce this magical masterpiece.  Know that it will have a place of pride in my DVD collection alongside all the other original releases and extended editions that already reside there.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3MLTMFJYYWYKY	Paul Kurtz	While good, not substantially better then the theatrical version.  I'm sorry to say that I was quite disappointed after anticipating the extended version for so long.  My problem is that, by and large, the extra scenes did not add to the movie as I had expected and hoped.  There were a few scenes that did add to the movie (though I won't mention them and be a spoiler for those waiting to get this in their Christmas stocking), and even though the drinking contest between Gilmi and Legolas was amusing, it really didn't add anything.  My main problem was I was expecting (maybe unreasonably) so much more from the scenes involving the House of Healing, and the blooming of the relationship of Faramir and Eowin.  It seemed to me, that these scenes didn't total more then five or six minutes and were so incomplete that Jackson could just have well left them out all together.I thought that the extended versions of both The Fellowship and The Two Towers were substantially better then the theatrical versions, but, for some reason, the extended version of Return of The King simply does not do that much for me (even though RoTK was my favorite episode of the trilogy).  It seemed that Jackson just wanted to add more footage to increase length and wasn't concerned with what he added.  It seemed to me that they were getting tired of the project and just wanted to be done with it as soon as possible.Sorry to sound negative.  I loved the trilogy and think that overall Jackson did a phenomenal job of all three movies.

When I saw the second movie, I left the theater a bit disappointed. I was hardly believing that they have corrupted Faramir and cursed, spelled or wathever Theoden, among other things. When I got the extended edition DVD, where there is a better explanation about why Faramir behaves like that I said to myself: Well, I can't expect to see the book on the screen. It has to be some adaptation.Watching the two extended editions, I liked much more the second. It merges nicelly with the first and the story goes very well.Then I ran to the theater to watch the third movie, but something in my mind was telling me that I would get disappointed once more.The movie started with the intro about Gollum and then to the point where we were left on the second. Then the story ran and even some points of the book that I was not expecting to see on the screen were there. I was amazed.Elijah Wood and Sean Astin have played Frodo and Sam very well. Gollum was expetacular as in the second movie. Viggo Mortenson did a great job as Aragorn and allowed us to see the change of the character, from a hidden, afraid ranger to the King of Gondor.The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unbelievable. I don't find the words to describe the grandiosity of these battles, but not the fight itself: The moments just before... The preparation, the movement of the troops, the sound of the drums... Very impressive.I left the theater feeling happy and very satisfied with the movie. Of course there are many things from the book left behind, but I don't feel that the movie looses anything due to that. If they are added in the extended DVD, good, otherwise, it is a wonderful movie by itself and is a great closing for the best trilogy of the decade (at least).	5.0	Not disappointed	2004-01-27	6	4	2

The LOTR trilogy is a HUGE exception to this.  Two entire discs are devoted to special features going into great detail on how the movies were created.

Epic battle scenes, get special effects, cinematography is on key, the acting is superb. The only i didnt like are the 10 endings on the extended edition. I eill always give mad respect to Peter Jackson he can bring almost anything earth shattering to life. Orlando Bloom as the perfect archer Legos one of my two favorite characters, my boy Viggo Mortenson as Aragon one of his most intense roles (next to A History of Violence & Eastern Promises), Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen all great actors giving 100% and bringing the book to life.

Sometimes the extended edition seems like it just tosses in another scene and maybe they did.Movie viewing quality: I compared my DVD to the Blu ray.  The blu ray is better, but I wouldn't say it is worth the cost if you already have the extended edition DVD.  I only had the theatrical version on DVD so this was a no brainer.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2BA2TH39PLLTQ	Peregate	"There were a number of terrific scenes, and the cinematography and special effects were probably the best I've ever seen.  I do not think it was too long, or had too many endings -- in fact I look forward to the extended edition.  The Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli story was especially well adapted, and Gollum was a delight, but after an astonishingly good start (the first two movies), I feel that Jackson slipped a little on this one.  I have three complaints:1 - Overlooking Minas Tirith (the big Gondor city) is an absurd man-made cliff with an opening in the middle of the wall.  All that was missing was a sign saying ""leap here"".  Was it really neccessary to create this monstrosity so that the steward could jump rather than just burn to death?2 - Some scenes were so melodramatic (including orchestra swells so obvious it seemed like parody) that I found myself laughing during what were supposed to be tender moments.  Sam and Frodo were the primary culprits.  Entirely too much time was spent repeating the same extreme close-ups of those two doing their best ""love and concern"" faces.3 - There was also a dull, unneccessary (and to those who read the books, confusing) side story about Arwen becoming mortal.A good movie, but not a great one.  I expect that the scenes added in the extended edition will bump it up to 4 stars for me, but it can't compare to Fellowship, or even Two Towers."	3.0	A Respectable Finish	2004-03-19	11	0	11

The animated ""Hobbit"" was simply awful, and casting children or midgets as hobbits would have been a travesty.Time passed, and SFX matured ... and somehow the right team crystallized around the project.  Peter Jackson is a genius, and I would vote every award to this film if I could.I was a little sorry to see that Tom Bombadil had been omitted.  I understand why; that episode would have slowed the story unbearably, but I missed old Tom... until I saw a picture of Peter Jackson.  They don't need Tom *in* the film because he created the team that brought it to life.So now all that's left is to heave a deep contented sigh, watch the EE of the first two films, go see the film again... and again... and wait for next November.  Even if the RotK EE is five hours, the time will pass like a human life to an Ent.Good books are so often ruined in the shift to screen.  I've only ever seen it done right once or twice before, as in Dances With Wolves.

Some people started watching it, not knowing what it was, and now they keep on watching it, forever, just because It is the movie that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friends...I think you get my pointThis movie is pretty good, when considering the time limitations. They had to take out some of my favorite parts of the book to keep the movie just under forever. I'm still watching this movie, but it must be pretty good, considering that it won every academy award they had in 2004, including best SHORT feature. This movie does an interesting job of incorporating somewhat grotesque images of mouths, or as my esteemed colleague refers to them as ""gross mouth pictures"" I was also able to learn that digital images can be schizophrenic. This story is an adaptation of Wagner's ""Ring Cycle"", which is an adaptation of Nordic mythology, which is an adaptation of fact, so you can say that this movie is based on a true story, although all of the characters do have somewhat odd names. They all live in the middle of the earth, which looks strikingly like New Zealand. The story tells of a ring that a bunch of people want, it doesnt look so great to me, but I'm not a hobbit; they aren't like us. After viewing much of this movie, I have reason to believe that J.R.R.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AAL5IOU1GIBSY	Peter Gresch	I keep this short: After seeing the theatrical release, I was hugely  disappointed with ROTK. The final 20 minutes of the theatrical release felt like a cheezy Sunday afternoon tug-my-heartstrings flick and spoiled the otherwise marvellous trilogy. I did have high hopes for the extended version. I trusted Weir. Please, Peter. And he did. He set it all to rights. I watched it on a rainy day and expected to fill some dead time with remeniscing and some fun. I was honestly GLUED to the screen as if seeing an entire new flick, loving the story as it finally developed before my eyes, displacing former disappointment with amazement and, yes, gratitude. If of all the 2 gazillion run-of-the-mill movies one like this trilogy comes along (and it's only every few decades that that happens), the entire movie-making industry - as bloated, artistically overestimated and culturally inane it largely is - has earned its keep.	5.0	It saved the Trilogy (for me)	2004-12-17	9	2	7
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A17BT73RVRQYSP	Peter Ingemi	"This movie is a spectacular finish to a specatular series, it is high art and is blessed with performances that will stand the test of time, visuals which dazzle the eyes and characters we care about.Other than about 10 minutes near the start the movie was never boring, I was particularly pleased that Merry & Pipin were not shortchanged as in the 2nd movie (but not the extended version)The only issue I have which keeps it from 5 stars is the editing.  There are several moments in the film when we think it is done, there is a fade and a come back.  I found myself shouting at the screen:  ""You are NOT going to leave us there"" when the movie would return.  I think the transition was poorly done.In fairness to Jackson the movie is already 3 1/2 hours which is VERY long for the regular movie going crowd. (although it didn't feel long at all to me) The extended DVD scenes in the other films, unlike many movies , were scenes of high quality that added to the plot.  (Seeing the extended version concerning ent draughts will cause a problem in this film) There are scenes that are clearly missing from this movie.  They need to be there.  I don't want to wait months for the extended version.I almost suspect he might have been better off making it 4 movies so the missing film could all be included but then what would you call the extra film, were would you cut it?I might be nitpicking I doubt I could have cut it better and the movie is spectaular in any case It deserves 4 1/2 stars and and all the acolades that it will get.  Re-watching all three I would say the best scenes of this one are the best of the entire series but the movie overall was not as good as the first.  Maybe when I see it again when its not midnight I'll think differently.  However the difference between the best and worst of the films is the difference between totally awsome and Merely awsome.Dont miss it."	4.0	"Excellent picture,  ""Merely Awsome"""	2003-12-18	5	2	3
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A13UFZZWOMZA6B	Peter Swift	"After six years of waiting, the Lord of the Rings film trilogy is finally complete. After checking Lordoftherings.net daily for updates and downloading every possible preview, trailer or ""sneak peak"" every year, the movies have finally come to a stunning conclusion in ""Return of the King.""Due to finals and the fact that I don't own a car, I was unable to watch Return of the King on the opening day and I had to settle on seeing it the next day.  Unfortunately, I watched the movie in between finals and I had a severe headache the whole time.  I came out of the movie disappointed and pretty much let down.  However, I vowed to give the movie a second chance.  After all the time and money I've invested in these films, I figured I should definitely watch it a second time before I actually make an opinion about it.  That second time came on Saturday night and I watched it in a very nice (and full) theater with a bunch of friends (after going to the third annual ""Geek Fest"" lord of the rings party). This time I loved the movie.  I knew what to look for and I watched things I hadn't noticed before.  It was spectacular.  I still think I like the first movie (Fellowship of the Ring) better, but this definitely beat The Two Towers for me.  What follows is basically a list of things I liked and didn't like about the movie - if you haven't seen it yet or haven't read the books, you probably don't want to read any further because there may be some spoilers.First of all, I think this film was a little too violent for me.  While the violence may have been an accurate portrayal of the book, I just didn't like it as much.  In ""Fellowship,"" the violence is sporadic and is part of a journey while in this movie, the violence is the end of the journey - the goal of the movie was basically to have this big war...and while the war was fantastic, huge and breathtaking, I'm just not fond of...well...war.  &lt;li>The movie started out with a very horror-film like scene with Smeagol killing Deagol.  This was very disturbing and the following transformation of Gollum was also very disturbing (the shot where he bites into a fish was disgusting and unnecessary...).  It was definitely an accurate look into Gollum's past, but it certainly wasn't pleasant.  I didn't especially like this part and I don't think it fit into this film all that well.  I probably would have placed this in the second movie as some background before the whole Faramir episode.  But then, I'm not the director of a multi-million dollar movie and Peter Jackson probably had good reasons for making the movie the way he did.&lt;li>I really, really loved the panoramic scenes of Minis Tirith and Gondor in general.  That was fantastic - I loved all the overhead ""fly-by"" shots of the scenery.  I also loved when Gandalf and Pippin took off towards Minis Tirith from Rohan - the friendship between Merry and Pippin was very evident in that scene.&lt;li>Faramir's retreat back to Minis Tirith while being chased by Nazgul was fantastic - seeing Gandalf ride out to meet them was one of my favorite scenes in the entire movie.&lt;li>My favorite scene in the entire movie was the lighting of the signal fires.  That was the most amazing film sequences I think I've ever seen.  I'm pretty sure I could watch that part over and over and over again.&lt;li>Pippin's song sang while Farmir marches back to Osgiliath was incredible.  If I wasn't so macho, I might have cried.&lt;li>The walk of the dead was pretty interesting and it was neat to see Aragorn finally accept his kingship.&lt;li>My biggest complaint about the whole movie would have to be the drawn out ending.  I thought it was over several times before it really was and I think I would have preferred to end it right after the coronation when the film pulls back to the map and narrator.  Unfortunately, it continues to drag on to the shire and then some.  The ending was very, very long...though I guess it makes sense to have an ending that long since it's really the ending to a 12 hour epic, not a 3.5 hour movie...Just to reiterate - I really liked this movie, just not quite as much as the first one.  I'm a little surprised that the movie only got a PG-13 rating, for the amount of violence and frightening sequences, it seemed like it deserved an R rating.  Still, it's impressive that probably the top grossing movie trilogy of all time will have no sex or vulgar language in it."	4.0	I Still Liked Fellowship of the Ring Better...	2003-12-22	13	6	7

The battle doesn't flow as well, especially at the end when it is drawn out so that Gothmog is fighting Eowyn and then Aragorn walks by and kills him. Somewhat anticlimactic for Eowyn to fight Gothmog after she killed the Witch King, but I am nitpicking.	4.0	Near great	2004-12-23	2	2	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3N6FVRJKQQB1E	P. Janssens	Why are people objecting to the release of the Extended Edition? If you are happy with what you have then don't buy it. LOTR1 and LOTR2 both have the same release system and after every cinema release it was been announced very clearly that they would first release a theatrical version and then later an extended edition and a limited edition with some gadgets. This is really no news under the sun.However, I considered the ending of LOTR3 just boring. Whereas Tolkien managed to keep his book interesting, the movie really should end after the scene in which Sam and Frodo are rescued by the birds. From that moment on, the movie is nothing but an everlasting serie of happy endings, one more boring and predictable than the other.I really hope that the extra 50 minutes put a few twists in the series of endings but I am not really expecting this. I will nevertheless buy the EE (and I also rate LOTR3 with 5 stars) because the title deserves it. LOTR is probably the best title I have ever read and / or seen (even though one should switch off his TV immediately after the abovementioned rescue).	5.0	What's the fuzz?

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ACMAUJEBY6GJF	Pl Amundsen	"Because of my high expectations after reading the book, well, I wish I hadn't red the book first. I saw the previous two LOTR before I started on the book, and they really thrilled me, both being great adventure-movies, the best I'd ever seen since Indiana Jones (if I am allowed to compare them) - I've noticed afterwards Mr.Jackson has been far from faithful to the book on all three movies, but his version of ""The Fellowship..."" I can swallow - mostly he has picked out the essential of the story in the first book, and I have actually nothing against the relationship he has ""made up"" between Arwen and Aragorn (the book gives you a hint - you can read about the origin and fate of their love in one the chapters that follows after the end of ""The Return...""). I find this movie the best of the three. Five stars.""Two Towers"" has several lacks, and especially the ""wolf-attack""-scene has irritated a friend of mine and me over and over again. What's the point?? There's PLENTY of action in the book of the ""Two Towers"" - and Aragorn falling off the cliff with, in my opinion, one of those dumb-looking wolves is only for the frustration and embarrasment to all those who have red the book - I don't get it... Thank God Mr.Jackson didn't bring Arwen to Helms' Deep(!) like he actually had planned. Thank God!There are plenty of other lacks in this one already. BUT, other than that, all in all, I find it as a mighty movie. I don't mean to say it is bad, not at all, but it could have been a lot better I personally think - and I find some of Mr.Jacksons' changes from the original story very unnecessary. 3 stars.""The Return Of The King"" - this one we had all been looking forwards to for a LONG time - the opening scene with the story behind Gollum is a masterpiece, well done Mr.Jackson, it's poetic and actually rather frightning (the actor behind Gollum is great). Then, the first time I saw it, it was all downhills -I don't know where to begin, but the pictures the book had left in my head didn't fit with what was going on on the screen. It was supposed to be dark, not rainy grey sky - that's not the most important thing I realize, but the movie turned out to be another epic-adventure-war-drama - missing the essential nerve of the book - for me it became too much effects - there were mighty scenes here no doubt, but... Minas Tirith, vow! But I was actually left with the impression that Mr.Jackson & co had been in a hurry at the end. She-La was creepy, but it could have been done creepier like in the book where Frodo AND(!) Sam tumbles around in the smelly darkness feeling evil eyes set on them, watching their every move, when suddenly ATTACK! But the main lack of them all, Sarumann - I can't understand how they could ""forget"" him, I know the extended version is yet to come, but this was a tragedy even for the theatrical version. He's one of the main characters in the book, especially in the end of ""The Return..."" - and I fear the extended version wont be adding the final chapter (the great ending) - in that case I find it impossible to forgive. The eye of Sauron when Frodo and Sam stumbles against Mount Doom looks pathetic, it looks just like a lighcaster at a prisontower - and I'm not the first to've noticed that.I've seen the movie six times or so now, it was better the second time after my big disappointment. I know I'm being negative against this great triology of an epic-adventure story told on screen. And that many will probably disagree with me, but in the end all that this is, just entertainment. And these movies function extremely well in that way - good acting, great filming and camera-work, nearly perfect locations for the the world and creatures of Middle Earth - it's just that for a movie supposed to be so true to the spirit of this famous book and to Tolkien I think when we reach to the end of it, I at least, it's not as true to the book as it should have been, a little too much hollywood sometimes.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	The Return Of The King is the final part to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It perfectly completes the trilogy of which the three films rank amongst the finest achievements in film history. The film follows Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his trusty companion Sam (Sean Astin) through their ascent of Mount Doom to destroy the ring. Meanwhile their friends face a final battle against Sauron's forces to defend Minas Tirith. Aragon (Viggo Mortensen) must face his true calling as the King of men and Legalos (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are by his side to fight the Orc forces. The battle scene is a visual masterpiece worthy of true epic stature. Andy Serkis who brilliantly voices the creature Gollum gets some real face time in the beginning of the film as we see the origins of Gollum. Ian McKellan is the films steady presence as Gandlaf and Liv Tyler and Miranda Otto bring beauty and strength to their roles of Arwen & Eowyn respectively. The film has so many intricacies and brilliant performances that they are impossible to detail. Behind all the amazing performances is the best performance of them all, director Peter Jackson's. Mr. Jackson's work is as good as any director's work in history and when you take all three films as a whole, it probably is the greatest work any director has ever achieved. The Return of the Kings was a big success Oscar night, sweeping all eleven categories it was nominated in including Best Picture and Director and tied Ben-Hur & Titanic for most Oscars for one film. With the six awards the first two installments received, it is far and away the most honored film franchise in history.  The first two extended editions were tremendous and I have no doubt that the final extended edition will be their equal.	5.0	Longer King	2004-10-21	18	11	7
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ATC9RGB5J872P	PMR	Despite its digital cast of millions, Jackson's trilogy actually manages to miniaturize Tolkien's epic tale. Example: the lighting of the war beacons at the beginning of RotK. In the book, they flare from east to west as Gandalf and Pippin ride from west to east.  It conveys the sense of a wider world in which events are unfolding independently of the characters' agency.  In the movie, the beacons flare only because Gandalf sends Pippin climbing up to light the one at Minas Tirith.  And at the other end, who of all the thousands at Theoden's court should notice but our old pal Aragorn! Lucky he was there, or the beacons would have burnt out and nothing would have happened.These are just two out of dozens of POINTLESS changes that the movie makes in Tolkien's grand design.  No film could have captured it in full, but these clowns have dismantled the Colosseum to build a Wal-Mart.  I give it one star because I have to and because by some accident they got Gollum right.	1.0	If Jackson and co. can get it wrong, they do -- time after time	2006-12-25	50	8	42

I am very sure that ""A customer from the real world"" doesn't understand the concept of entertainment.On to something that matters!  My father passed on in 1995.  I introduced him to ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and I believe that he read it many times.  I inherited his old copy, and it was falling apart.  Watching FOTR, I wept and beamed with delight.  Peter Jackson got everything *exactly* right.  No compromises.  The vision I had from four or five readings was all right there on the screen.  I really hoped that Daddy could somehow see it - I knew he's be delighted.""The Return of the King"" is the fastest paced part of the trilogy, yet it fully fills out all of the characters that we've come to love and care about in the first two installments.  I haven't seen Mr. Jackson's movie, yet, so it's a bit presumptive of me to comment.  Yet, his other two have been so spot-on, that I'll take the day off and tell everyone why to go see it.  I am absolutely sure that he'll, once again, get it exactly right."	5.0	Completely confident of excellence!	2003-12-03	13	6	7
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3MWBPUM4LV9OX	"Poncey ""fdkjlfnadglkdjng"""	My review may be coloured by these 3 points.-I saw Fellowship of the Ring before I read it.-I saw Two Towers before I read it.-I read Return of the King before I saw it.The problems with 2 Towers were to do with plot & character changes, and these were wiped away in my opinion by the fabulous extended cut. Hopefully the problem of this 3rd film will be fixed with the DVD next year, these are the omissions.The weakness of this film stems from the minor character Denethor, had he revealed his palantir stone before his death, and told of Saurons power, the climax of the film may not have been so awkward. Instead it seems that the goodies will win regardless of the rings destruction or not, and this is a major mistake by the director.The movie is noticeably fragmented, which I did not notice in the first 2 installments, it seems there are many scenes cut here and there throughout the film. As a result the pacing is very fast, it seems rushed, and certainly this will be fixed by the extended version in 2004.Effects, setting,acting and dialogue are all incredible, just like the first two, a testament to completing a trilogy all at the same time and under the same writers and directors.A must-see fantasy epic.

It is sheer magic, and stands alone as a wonderful piece of documentary production. If you have a soft spot for LORT, you WILL love it. If you are interested in the art and craft of movies, you WILL play it at least 3 times. If you even work in any sort of project-based field, you WILL see yourself (or your dreams) on-screen.It presents an amazing insight into what it was like working on such a unique endeavour. The commitment and passion shine through, but also you see what went into to building such a team. It didn't come from no-where, and I came away with a new appreciation for Peter Jackson's leadership, putting him in the Dunlap/Turner/Gates/Clinton league of you ask me and a generation above and beyond the likes of Lucas, Scorcese et al [the old guard].There are some amazingly touching moments revealed, such as the hakka performed by the stunt crew in honour of the ""two kings"" and as a farewell to Viggo - truely he had become their ""king"". And the final takes with Frodo, which PJ clearly cannot bring himself to end.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2VN986E5KR1NV	ProperGander News (Dr. Emil Shuffhausen)	"""The Return of the King"" is the definitive chapter in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and it deservedly won 11 Academy Awards for its brilliant theatrical release.  Now on DVD, with copious extended footage, the film plays out as a splendid epic for the ages that manages to be grand and intricate all at once.  Rarely has such a huge spectacle also held such finely crafted details, whether it be the set, the costumes, the special effects, the script, or especially the beautifully nuanced acting.Here, J.R.R. Tolkien's masterful tale of Middle Earth reaches its rich and satisfying conclusion, but not before carrying the viewer on a fantastical thrill ride that swoops and weaves and dances through scenes of joy, violence, romance, friendship, war, and redemption.  Many scenes stand out, including the horrifying flights of the Nazgul, the dizzying and heartbreaking climb of Frodo and Sam, the stirring valor of little Merry Brandybuck, the dialog about death between Pippin and Gandalf, the songs of Pippin and Aragorn, and the showstopping derring-do of Legolas on the Oliphants...not to mention the spectacular sequence of the lighting of the signal fires.  Director Peter Jackson will be forever enshrined in the hall of directorial geniuses...this risk-taking maverick took a huge gamble and it has paid off handsomely.As expected, the extra scenes are treasures that enhance the storyline.  The presentation and packaging of these four discs is ultra-deluxe; this is truly a keepsake edition.  The quality of the picture and sound is crisp and crackling.  And, did I mention, this just may be the greatest motion picture ever made? In short, this is everything you could ever want in a DVD package.

Runyan	I am excited about the new scenes:  Aragorn with the Palantir, Gandlaf and the Witchking, Houses of Healing, the Mouth of Sauron and all that stuff.  It all sounds great.  However, after I saw the movie I read the final book and there was 100 extra pages AFTER the ring was destroyed.  My favorite part of the book trilogy was without a doubt the Battle of Bywater.  It showed how much the Hobbits had changed and how bad ass they had become.  So if the extended version does not include the Battle of Bywater I will be very disappointed.  In my mind that was almost as crucial a part of the story as the ring being destroyed.	4.0	It gets 5 stars IF...	2004-10-01	54	18	36

It it extremely long, 250 minutes! If you need to know the story, here's my version; The film begins with how Smeagol became Gollum. Later, we see Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Theoden heading to Isengard to get information out of Saruman. At Rohan, Pippin sees in the Palantir that Sauron wants to strike at Minas Tirith. Gandalf and Pippin travel there to warn them. Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum continue their journey even closer to Mordor, where Gollum has a trap waiting for them. All the war scenes and beautiful scenery are awesome!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1Z75KIRO2YMT3	"""pureincubus"""	Well, where to begin. When I first ventured into the theater to watch this movie, I didnt have any knowledge of what to expect. Having not read the books, it was as though I was tossed blindly into this adventure, which, in a way, may have heightened the experience for me since everything was so new and intreguing. First off, I got my fill of the hairy footed Frodo, also known as the amazingly talented and handsome actor Elijah Wood, accompanied by a very composed and prank-weilding wizard, Gandalf (damned if I can remember the actor's name.. but the praise is there nontheless). Throughout their adventures, I began to find myself engulfed in the movie itslef, as though I was experiencing it alongside the tiny hobbit and his band of loyal misfits. The journey took them from snowy peaks, to dark and deadly lows, with not a pause in action to be seen. The landscaping brought with it many a gasp, and the towns and havens passed each exibited an unique and colourful atmosphere, very key in creating the perfect mood for the situation. When the end of the movie finally arrived, not only was I crying my eyes out (and attempting to hide the embarassment of running mascara), but I was wishing the film had have continued, for three hours, surprisingly, didnt quite seem like long enough. Now, three film re-views later, I find myself in a rampant panic, not being able to wait for the next masterpiece to be unveiled. If this film was any indication, the next two movies should be each as stellar, if not moreso, then the last. Finally, my recommendation? Corny, yes.. but, dont just see the film, experience it, and enjoy the ride.	5.0	No Oscar? No matter, still a triumphant movie!	2002-03-27	35	10	25

Yes, they left out quite a chunk.  The part they didn't do was the Hobbits return to the Shire and the Batlle of the Shire, which included Sauroman's death and the end of Grima Wormtongue. This, however, would have either added at least an hour to a three hour film, or else might have required a fourth film, as would have happened if they'd included everything they didn't have in the film.  Still, to kind of paraphrase Shakespeare, ""I come to praise this effort, not to bury it!""  The final film is one helluvan action packed flick, and believe thee me, they pulled out all the stops in making the last battle.  It's got everything you could desire in a major battle and then some.  Do the ""good guys"" win?  Read the book or else watch the movie.  Either way, you ain't gonna be disappointed.  This is indeed a Five Star flick, in spite of all that's missing.  In fact, were it possible, I'd give it six stars ******, so there now too and let that be a lesson to you!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1CA1A1MGW0I3J	Raisuli the Magnificent	"I just don't get how anyone can really deeply invest themselves in a world of imagination with such a somber outlook on what was supposed to be a tale of adventure.  When I read Tolkien's works there was an heir of mythology, adventure, some serious overtones of international conflict in a fantasy world, but nothing profound as such.  And yet the films, and specifically this film, treat Tolkien's tales with a kind of heavy-handedness that I think only holds back a better movie.Don't get me wrong, it's respectable entertainment, and being a fan of sword play on the screen I truly do enjoy what has been presented.  But I just can't get into a serious vein of ""what if"" kind of mindset.  The kind of framework that a young boy's mind would create is what's needed, but this film doesn't even placate to the inner child, so much as it holds the inner child in an adult esteem.  That is consider the classic ""The Night Before Christmas"" poem.  If we were to bring it to life via a film we would not lose it's heir of whimsy.  We would not alter the mood to cater to the adults who were watching the film, so much as we would create a film that catered to the story, which itself is supposed to be appealing for what it is.But yet we have a sprawling adventure saga that's been given a tremendous amount of what Woody Allen calls' ""heviosity"".  Everyone is bent on going through deep emotional turmoil to bring about an end to a war that is a little murky regarding its causes and sources of conflict.  Truth be told the causes for the war are supernatural, and we get a hint of that, but more or less we're sold a bill of goods in terms of being presented the reality of the war and how to end it, not so much what caused it in the first place.  Such stories are children's fare, but the film doesn't really cater to children, so much as the adult child.And I guess that's why I don't get into these films, nor hold them in any real high esteem.  They'e not Kurosawa's ""RAN"" with some fantasy flavoring sprinkled in here and there.  No.  They are truly films meant for a child like mindset, but geared for an adult.  I think of stuff I like, and I do have a number of guilty pleasures that, as an adult, I can enjoy on a child's level.  But films like ""Return of the King"" try to sell us more on the conflict than delving into the human heart by refraining from too much emotional overplay.The Lord of the Ring's series are big films with lots of artistry, logistics and organizational achievements the likes of which we'll probably never see again, and have not seen since Elizabeth Taylor's ""Cleopatra"".  But for all that, they are, after all, just movies.Me, I would have preferred something a little less serious but not too light hearted.  I would have preferred goblins as Tolkien described, not overplayed like Jackson's film.  Ditto with all the other creatures and beings populating Tolkien's realm.  But, again, having made those remarks I do have to admit that I enjoy them for what they are, and I can't think of any other film maker with as much energy or passion for the material as someone like a Peter Jackson to bring Tolkien's world to life.In this regard I will call Pete Jackson the TRUE lord of the rings for our time."	3.0	Overwrought, silly, but okay entertainment.	2011-03-11	4	0	4

For first-time viewers, the ending of the movie is kinda like three endings, but it was necessary for those of us who love these books.Having read the books 9 times and read just about every other book on Tolkien and listened to all the radio plays, my expectations were very high for Peter Jackson's trilogy. He did not disappoint. After the first one, I knew we were (finally) in for a real treat. The last one is at least as good as the others. I saw this 5 times in the theaters (the first hour six times, but the IMAX version was too loud for my son).

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2LNP6JE11OHZR	Razor Queen(Witch Hunter)	You can probably guess from the title that this review is probably the most un-helpful nonsense ever written. You have been warned.I was residing in England when rotk came out. I don't know what it was like for you guys in America but boy were we brainwashed. You couldn't go anywhere without some advertisement for the movie hitting you in the face. I'm a student and my only means of travel is by big double-decker busses. But I wasn't even safe at a bus stop since nearly every bus had a huge lotr poster covering its side. Amusingly enough is was of Sam passionately clutching Frodo in his arms. Is it me or do those two hobbits have the hots for each other?I saw tfotr in Tenerife, Spanish dub. Me and my friend Sam (seriously I have four friends all called Sam) decided to check it out. We had no idea what it was about, plus it started five minutes before anyone was in the theatre so we all missed the beginning explanation. Anyway sam and me tried our best. An hour and a half later the bell rang for half time (yeah this old Spanish cinema gives you a 5 minute break half way through to stock up on munchies, go to the bathroom, phone a friend etc.) Anyway me and Sam were kind of worried since the film should of ended by now. We came on foot at ten o-clock at night, so we were starting to get apprehensive. Plus the temperature had dropped rapidly and you don't get heating in Tenerife. The little five year olds (you don't get ratings either) were bored and had starting running up and down the isles. The film finally resumed. After we had stopped laughing at the very humorous death of Boromeir (pincushion) we were completely floored by the lovely display of affection between Frodo and Sam. The ending confirmed it for us`I'm glad you're with me Sam', croons Frodo as Sam gazes dreamily at him, while the panpipes from titanic got into full swing.As I walked home at half past one in the morning terrified for my safety and hastily looking for sex maniacs I vowed to see the rest.Right so any way I'm in Leeds staring at this huge poster on this huge bus and I decided Id have to go. The Two Towers had already provided me with more meaningful glances and romantic dialogue between the two of them.English cinemas in Leeds are much grander then that of Tenerife and we all piled in. There wasn't a seat empty. We all arrived an hour early to get seats so everyone chatted to pass the time. When the lights finally dimmed I was more then ready for the film to begin...only to be bombarded by half an hour of advertisements for other films. By the time trotk started I had drunk my whole large coke. Not a good idea. These grandiose cinemas don't have quaint little breaks for people to relieve themselves. I ran out and just found my way back through enormous sea of people in time the see Gandalf the white. My god I was nearly blinded. Is this guy in cahoots with Daz washing powder? You'd think after all that horse riding he'd be a little dirty but this guy is practically glowing with freshly washed, line-dried radiance. This film has some seriously funny quirks that aren't supposed to be there. Like how can Eowyn chop off that dragons head in two swipes? What the hell? Superwoman is that you? Orlando Bloom should just remain the silent pretty one because he can't act to save his life. Aragon's accent goes from american to english and back like no bodies business. I think the joking around with Gimli has gone far enough, did he have a point in this movie other then comic relief. Merry and Pippin did much better in this. They seem to like each other pretty, ahem, much as well.Pippin: `I knew you'd find me! Are you going to leave me again?Merry: `No Merry...I'm going to take care of you'Everybody:AWWWWWWWWWW!!!!And then we come to the loony steward. Wow does this guy have some issues. Like a few sandwiches short of a picnic. He seems to be quite resistant to fire too, since he ran all that way to throw himself off the highest point of minas tirith. Should be called suicide ledge, its perfect. Anyway onto Frodo and Sam. Sam's been drugging Frodo's water (what else would explain all that swaying) in order to have his way with him. I have never seen so many `almost' kiss scenes in my life.  Can Frodo's eyes bulge out any more? I mean he looked like flick from A Bug's Life. Then when they're on that conveniently placed rock surrounded by lava Sam brings up Rosie for no reason what so ever. Frodo is undeterred and goes for it and the scene respectively pans to black. I would have been satisfied with that ending I really would. In fact I was just so happy it was over. I thought I might have contracted deep vein thrombosis from sitting there so long. But no sooner had i emitted my sigh of relief when back comes the picture and we were presented with another 4 endings. I wont mention the slow mo hobbit romp on the bed ending.Finally Sam marries Rosie for no obvious reason, and Frodo is so hurt he leaves. But before he says his final farewell he kisses Sam on the...forehead and explains that he can't be torn in two (between Frodo and Rosie) forever.When I came out of the cinema I realised I had been sat there for 5 hours. I could hardly walk. Dont get me wrong this is a good film, but it strings you along. If they were not going to be together at the end, why all those hints that there's somthing going on?. It annoyed me. Its as if it was done purly for scandal and fanfiction writers, who are having a wale of a time.Whoa this review has only been on for 24 hours and all ready I've received loads of UN helpful votes.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2PXW7BKLKO9C7	Reader	This movie was badly paced, poorly directed, overlong and had at least three schmaltzy endings one after the other.  (Being true to the book's numerous endings does not give one leave to be cloying and saccharine in their execution.)  Now you want to sell a version of this bloated whale of a film with an additional 50 minutes?  No way.  The first two installments of this series were great.  By all means watch them, buy the extended versions (I did) and enjoy them over and over.  But read Tolkien's Return of the King.  The book is far superior to anything Peter Jackson's virtually unwatchable finale has to offer.	1.0	The worst of the series	2004-11-28	104	8	96

I can't remember a movie I did like like this! Usually, I see a trailer & if it is good, I think that would be a good book & am disappointed by the movie. I read this book because my family liked the 1st movie & I thought it would be a good book, but for once, I feel the movie is actually better than the book. There were so many points in the book that went off in tangents, but the movie lasts over 3 hours & left me wishing they had shown the scouring of the shire & the things left in the appendices. It absolutely needed all of the many endings & I would have loved to see more. I know why they were left out-for pacing reasons but miss them.	5.0	I would rate it higher if I could!	2004-04-21	2	2	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2BUGOG1JMLK0	"Rebecca ""lotrgrl9"""	* This review might be somewhat biased because I am a Lord of the Rings fanatic *Never has any film evoked some much emotion in me. Return of the King should not be praised solely for it's incredible visual and sound effects or it's meticulous attention to detail, but for the depiction of it's characters and the emotional intensity it delivers. Peter Jackson is a remarkable director for wrapping up such a magnificant epic in that manner. Also, Howard Shore, the composer behind the beautiful music, should be praised for the score. The music transports the listener and perfectly interwines with the scenes down to the last string.Return of the King left me tear-soaked and stunned and I could not get out of my seat. The credits began to roll and I refused to believe it was over - there wouldn't be another one next Decemeber. The range of Sean Astin's performance as Samwise is extroadinary and Elijah Wood's Frodo is the perfect picture of corrupted innocence. Also, Billy Boyd's performance (and his singing, which broguht me to tears) as Pippin and Miranda Otto's performance as Eowyn both stood out. Their characters had not been an integral part of the story thus far, but in Return of the King, they shine.*Spoliers - Do not read if you have not seen the film*Most tear-jerking moments: When Pippin sings for Denethor mirroring Farmir's ride to Osgiliath and Denethor's eating (symbolizing the spilling of blood), when Sam delivers his speech about the Shire in springtime, when Sam carries Frodo up the slope of Mt. Doom, when Aragorn gives his speech at the Black Gate, when the Ring is destroyed and Merry cheers for Frodo, when Frodo wakes in the Houses of Healing to see Gandalf for the first time since Moria, when the entire company at Minas Tirith bow to the Hobbits, when Frodo leaves to get onto the ship bound for the West, and finally, when Sam says the last line of the film which happens to be the last line in the book.There has been some complaint as to the film having several endings. (ie: fading to black and then continuing)In response to that complaint: This is how Tolkien wrote it and it was the best way for Peter Jackson to wrap up each individual story line.I have tried my best to convey my feelings about Return of the King and I could go on for pages, but you have to see the first two films, understand Tolkien's world, and baisically... have eyes to see that this is the greatest film made to date.	5.0	A True Masterpiece	2004-03-09	6	5	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A9BTT2CEV9FL7	"redflashmike ""redflashmike"""	Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings series  (altogether) is the greatest film and epic I have ever seen.  Personally, I place it far and away ahead of the Godfather and the original Star Wars trilogies.  Nothing  comes close.  Such detail- such amazing scenes and battles- and without a doubt amazing characters who come to life on the screen.  Return of the King is the grand finale to the epic and  the most moving chapter of the three.I'm sure many others will agree-  the scene with Frodo and Sam on the mountainside of Doom- that scene has so much power, a true testament to the friendship and loyalty of Sam to Frodo.  The music soars and mounts as Sam helps Frodo move up the mountain in a moment on film that just tugs at your heartstrings.You cannot miss this movie-  this is the movie event of our time- maybe for all time.	5.0	A Grand Finale	2003-12-22	5	5	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3KWLX57I2P94P	"""rek_jedi05"""	"This was simply a great movie. I can watch parts of it again and again.Acting: The acting was great. I cannot say anymore save to elaborate. In particular, Sean Astin's performance as he weeps over a ""dead"" Frodo was amazing; it made me cry, which is something i have never done in a movie. ""Don't go where I can't follow . . ."" Viggo Mortensen was, as always, great - ""I bid you STAND, MEN OF THE WEST!"" - and Ian McKellen gave life to the role of Gandalf, Elijah Wood to Frodo, and the rest of the cast. Orlando Bloom, whom I thought for a long time was a stupid chick magnet, is actually a fair actor.Storyline: The plot is rushed at places, but that can be excused. I, for one, am willing to overlook the numerous plot changes when I step back and look at the big picture - only by changing the plot in places can a director successfully bring a long, complex book like ROTK to the screen. There were a few truly great lines: ""Go now and die in whatever way seems best to you!"", ""You will not touch him again!"", ""I go to my fathers, in whose mighty presence I shall know no shame"", ""There is no veil between me and wheel of fire!"" and ""Then let us be rid of it!"", and my favorite: ""That STILL only counts as one!""Special effects: Mumakil. Need I say more? Seriously, though, the special effects were incredible. I cannot find anything that compares with the charging mumakil (oliphaunts), the brief fight scene between the Nazgul and the eagles, and the spectacular ride of the Rohirrim. Oh, and the Dead at the Pelennor fields. Another scene worthy of an Oscar alone was the lighting of the beacons. Ahh, the mountain views . . .There are parts in this movie that made me want to scream in pure joy. The ride of the Rohirrim (""Forth Eorlingaaaaaas!""), with its great music and great dialogue, and its sense of triumph, was one of those parts. Then came the mumak attack, which blew my mind. Sam's timely arrival in Shelob's lair was yet another of those scenes.As I said, there are more than a few changes fromt he book. Most of these were for the sake of time, and a few, like the parting of Sam and Frodo, were perhaps a little ill-advised but easily dwarfed by the otherwise great elements of the movie.Some people don't like this movie. I can see why some fantasy-hater might not think it deserved all its Academy Awards (I'm not saying this hypothetical fantasy hater doesn't need to get a life), but they should at least appreciate the epic-ness, the fine score, and the wonderful acting.One last thought: This is a movie that has great special effects, but it all is a backdrop for the human story that rumbles on throughout the trilogy. As I said, sometimes the plot is rushed, but one can only hope the extended version will straighten out the wrinkles and make this grand, wonderful, beautiful movie into what it could easily be.Another final thought (this will be the last one): At first I thought the deletion of the Scouring of the Shire scene was a good thing, since that part seemed to just drag on the ending. But now I think about it, and it had some symbolism and themes that are not so easily thrown away. The movie works fine wihtout that scene, but if the extended DVD added it, I won't complain."	5.0	You bow to no one . . .	2004-06-13	4	4	0

No one has done this type of movie this well before. So thats five stars from me off the bat. The creatures were incredibly detailed and thats one of the most important of factors when tackling a fantasy film. But darn Peter, darn darn darn, there are things that really annoyed me...1) There were tons of zoom in close-ups, which would be veryirritating if one were looking for them. They couldve beenshot in different ways so easily, but whats done is done.2) Close-ups were bad enough, but you had to make Billy Boyd bethe one to say that something cool is going to happen at thismoment of the movie, and say it in a real high soprana voice?""The trees, the trees! Weeeee! "" ""The eagles, the eagles!Weeeee!""3) The close-up of Cate Blanchett when she boards the ship, whywas that added in???? Man, why did you let her give that ""heehee Ive got something good to put in your stockings thisholiday"" smile????? That was just, just, shes beautiful butno, never do that again!4) It was wrong to give John Rhys-Davies 2 voices. Yes he ishighly talented, but it was so noticible to me. And treebeards voice was a tad rip off of Morla from NeverEndingStory dont you agree?5) You should have let Andy Serkis do a ""normal"" voice,instead of retaining the Gollum voice for Smeagol. If yousomehow had inserted a glimpse of Smeagols childhood wherehe inhaled helium so much one day that he got stuck likethat for the rest of his life, then it would be ok. But,alas, no. You showed the whole transformation sequence, thevoice shouldve been transforming too.6) Ok this is the worst edition to the extended version of ROTK.At hells gate, the horsed representative of Sauron...Thatmouth was just ridiculous. The character, was just stupid.No wonder his head was chopped off, he was just so annoyingas the intimidation he wished he wouldve had on otherpeople in the movie. At every, single, area, of that scene,was a turn of his head, cut back to a hobbit, a turn ofthe creatures head and stupid grunt, cut back to good teammember, etc. you know? Poor and weak scene. Stupid character.Peter Jackson, you are incredible for doing this and I still watch your DVDs (extended) on occasion. But if you make another, if any director who is shivering in their boots to do a fantasy cuz they might not live up to the greatness of LOTR, please, PLEASE just heed my warnings posted here. Thank you :)PS- those directors shouldnt shiver, but get the balls to do their own realistic quality of a creature or landscape.

Gorham ""RCG2"""	"""The Return Of The King"" is the perfect ending to the most outstanding movie trilogy EVER made. ""Return"" picks up right where ""Two Towers"" leaves off (as did part 2 leave off perfectly from part 1). Frodo's journey to Middle-Earth concludes where he must destroy the Ring of Power. The Tolkien classic stays true to the story and director Peter Jackson paints the silver screen as if he's Rembrandt himself. The entire cast is back... Elijah Wood (as the Hobbit Frodo), Sean Astin (as Frodo's trusted friend Sam), Viggo Mortensen (as the destined king Aragorn), Orlando Bloom (as the elf archer Legolas), Ian McKellon (as wizard Gandalf), and Gollum/Smeagol (the computer animated schizo tour guide leading Frodo & Sam to Mordor). ""Return Of The King"" is a huge movie of epic proportions. Huge sets, incredible scenery, amazing costumes, a huge cast, and huge computers holding huge amounts of memory for all those eye popping computer-generated effects. The battle scenes are some of their fiercest I've ever seen... and the Dark Lord Sauron and the grunts that make up his army are what some people's nightmares are made of. This movie is about friendship, trust and inner strength... and about three-and-a-half hours long. The 2nd disc features 2 documentaries, a ""making of"" special, a ""National Geographic"" special, a ""Quest Fulfilled"" commentary from Peter Jackson, and an incredible trilogy ""supertrailer"". Easily the best movie of 2003 (earning 11 Oscar nominations and winning 11 Oscars)... and hands down the best trilogy ever put to film (the complete trilogy earned a record 30 Oscar nominations). Fact: ""The Return Of The King"" brought in two hundred and fifty million ($$) on it's first weekend of release.

Featuring the denouement of all that has come before, with great actors to play the parts, gorgeous visuals to enchant us, fantastic special effects, and a glorious score throughout the film, &quot;Return of the King&quot; represents over 3 hours of cinematic genius. It is a nearly-perfect conclusion to the story that was begun in &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and continued in &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; This should not be a surprise to anyone.The DVD presentation of &quot;Return of the King&quot; is of consistently high-quality with the previous two Theatrical version DVD releases. The colors and picture are crisp, and the sound is clear. The Special Features on Disc 2 are well-made and have at least a few moments which should delight most viewers (watch close for Gandalf saying &quot;Bollocks!&quot; in a featured outtake). The National Geographic special included on Disc 2 was a pretty interesting examination of how characters and events in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; mirror historical events and personages, such as William Wallace and Theodore Roosevelt. The two &quot;Making Of&quot; features are both good, but they have quite a bit of overlapped material. The featurettes are interesting but not particularly deep.The film itself is simply a masterpiece, and worth buying this DVD just by itself. The Special Features are just gravy, really.And now, finally, I can watch the whole thing, from beginning to end, in a nine-hour marathon!Of course, I fully expect that the Extended Edition DVD to be released late 2004 will be an improvement upon this film, but for now, this version is more than good enough, and I'll be watching it at least a few more times.

The story is brilliant: the ""recovery"" of the events of The Two Towers, including the fate of Saruman only found in the extended edition will tie some loose ends and begin the story for the finale of the trilogy.The long build-up of war is amazing; the tension is real, and the individual stories of all the characters are spectacular to follow.  When the battle finally erupts the action is film-making history.  The climatic scenes of the trilogy are spectacular, and the extended scenes cover loose ends, more stunt sequences, and generally enrich the storyline.  The most story-rich additions are probably Saruman's demise, and the  relationship of Faramir and Eowyn, which is still lacking from Tolkien's vision in favor of Jackson's extended ""dream"" sequences between Aragorn and Arwen, but nothing to complain about.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1F1FOR46702YF	R. J Rey	"Acclaimed director Peter Jackson closes the final chapter to his award-winning fantasy epic with the astonishing blockbuster ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"". As Sauron's ring poisons Frodo's (Elijah Wood) soul, Sam (Sean Astin) aids his cursed friend against the many dangers of the dark land of Mordor, but the devilish Gollum plots against them to steal back his precious ring. With their fate in the hands of their two hobbit friends, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) unite the armies of Middle Earth against the fearsome legions of the Dark Lord. ""The Return of the King"" is a spectacular edge-of-your-seat masterpiece from the creative minds of Peter Jackson and his top-notch crew. This exciting fantasy spectacle features a powerful and moving story, memorable characters, a rich music score and strong emotional subplots. Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin and Ian McKellen deliver some fine performances. Its thrilling action sequences and amazing special effects are incredibly breathtaking. The gripping battle of Gondor is a remarkable heart-pounding visual achievement to behold.Like the previous ""The Lord of the Rings"" DVDs, ""The Return of the King"" 2-Disc Edition is definitely one of the best New Line DVDs ever released. The award-winning blockbuster is presented in its original 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Its picture quality is simply outstanding with stunning sharpness and excellent contrast. The Dolby Digital 5.1-EX sound delivers such amazing clarity and powerful surround effects. The DVD contains three in-depth behind-the-scenes documentaries, six short web featurettes, two theatrical trailers, TV spots, the seven-minute Lord of the Rings trilogy super trailer and bright animated menus. Though many fans anxiously wait for its Extended Edition, ""The Return of the King"" 2-Disc Edition is a worthy DVD purchase and gets an ""A""."	5.0	Glorious Epic Finish	2004-05-25	2	2	0

That happened when I saw the first movie and then started reading the books to understand what was going on.Have so far seen all three films multiple times and own the platinum versions of the DVDs.  I'm most impressed with ""Return of the King.""I'm grateful that Jackman opted to include more footage of Eowyn's life and struggles.  You see her battling the Orc lieutenant, meeting Faromir, and showing her character in various ways.In general, I believe the added scenes helped a great deal to illustrate the story more, but were not quite necessary for a theatre presentation.

But it's a great film, that stands head and shoulders above the others for what it does.One gripe that purists all have is that - well - the series of films isn't really the Lord of the Rings, the book.  The characters aren't the characters - Gimli is more flippant, Aragorn more showy, Faramir is less noble, and...well, the list really does go on.  It's a gripe I share, and I do wish that they hadn't been changed.  But the story itself is retained pretty well, mostly, and the general 'feel' of the whole thing - the world itself, which Tolkien loved and detailed with care above and beyond any of his characters - is quite superb throughout.There are other changes; here and there, you'll see something that didn't happen in the book, or something changed for dramatic effect.  But to the average filmgoer, they simply won't know - these things damage the film as an adaptation of the book, but they certainly don't damage the film as a film.  In fact, quite the reverse - they make the film more energetic, more immediate and more watchable, which is why these changes were made.A book is not a film, nor a film a book - and the two could never perfectly mirror each other.  What has happened here is that a great story, in a great world, written with slow detail, has inspired a great story, in a great world, written up as a faster, more immediate film.It's not the book - and people who've seen the film should probably read the books too.  But it's a great film.	5.0	A great film that isn't the book	2004-12-06	31	25	6
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A4FX5YCJA630V	"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya"""	"It's finally here, after so much waiting - the conclusion to the screen adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"", and boy was it worth the wait. In the final installment, ""The Return of the King,"" the buildup and suspence of the two previous movies finally reaches its climax, and explodes across the screen. At three hours and twenty minutes that race by like a marathon, that once more create a delicate balancing act between the epic and the intimate, director Peter Jackson and his cast and crew save the best for last as the characters we all know and love go up against the final great hurdle in their attempt to save Middle-Earth.With the wizard Saruman and his army of Uruk-Hai defeated, the divided Fellowship members and their allies now turn their attention once more toward their greatest threat: Sauron the Dark Lord and his seemingly endless armies swarming westward toward the White City of Men: Minas Tirith. This is the city that Gandalf and Pippen travel to in order to bring tidings of hope to its gradually fading Stewart, the Lord Denethor and his last surviving son Faramir, who goes so far as to lead a suicide mission to the outlying city of Osgiliath in a heart-breaking attempt to win his father's approval.Meanwhile Aragorn prepares for his own challenge: to brave the Paths of the Dead armed with the reforged shards of Narsil and force the ghostly army that lies beneath the Dwimmerberg Mountain to come to Gondor's aid, along with the elf Legolas and the dwarf Gimli. Yet on his mind always is the elf Arwen, who must finally her decision concerning her immortality, and whether to defy her father Lord Elrond in loosing it so that she may stay with Aragorn.It is left to King Theoden and his nephew Eomer to muster Rohan to ride to Gondor, though both are just a tad too preoccupied to keep an eye on Lady Eowyn and Merry, who are none to pleased at the news they are to be left behind...And against this collosal backdrop of armies and battles is the lonely figures of Frodo, Samwise and Gollum, continuing their quest to trek into the very heart of Mordor, and destroy the Dark Lord's ruling Ring in the fire of the volcanic Mount Doom. Their journey is made all the more difficult by the treacherous Gollum, in his lust for the Ring and his hatred of Sam, who begins to convince Frodo that ""the fat hobbit"" may not be as faithful as he appears. And all the while, he leads them closer and closer to ""her"" - the terror of Cirith Ungol, the evil Shelob.Watching ""Return of the King"" is undoubtably an incredibly exhausting experience - wave after wave of diasters and triumphs pour over the audience, whether it be an army of orcs over-running Minas Tirith, the arrival of the Rohans on the Pelennor Fields, the terrifying flight of the Nazgul on their winged steeds, or the final devastating climax of Frodo within the blasting heat of Mount Doom. The pace never stops for a second, and it takes a very strong personality not to get even a little teary during some of emotional scenes.&lt;...like the ""Fellowship"" and ""Two Towers"", there will be an extended edition of the DVD that includes the whopping hour and five minutes of footage that was cut from the theatrical release. Yet ultimately, the movie pays homage to what was closet to Tolkien's heart, the achievements and heroic nature of four small hobbits (one loyal gardener in particular finally gets to shine) and the universal themes of sacrifice, betrayal, loyalty and unconditional love.Whether one is satisfied or not, ""The Return of the King"" is without a doubt the must-see movie of the year, that is sure to be recognised throughout time as a milestone in cinematic history for its beauty, scale, intensity, and the achievement of the impossible: a successful adaptation of the most beloved book of the century."	5.0	"""I'm glad you're with me.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A17WM3NTCID9DS	"Robert D. Harmon ""bobnbob3"""	This film merits all the superlatives; 5 stars are frankly not enough. This edition of the DVD is probably going to be surpassed by the extended edition due at year's end, but by all means go for this DVD if you must have ROTK now; the sound, film quality and extras are outstanding quality and will keep you quite happy till Christmas, yess my preciouss.The only quibble I might offer over Peter Jackson's choice not to film one ending from the book: the Scouring of the Shire, a rather bitter chapter in which the hobbits return to the Shire to find that Saruman had taken over, polluted and trashed the country, and that Merry and Pippin and Sam had to lead a revolution and fight the last battle of the War of the Rings in the Shire itself. Given that Prof. Tolkien hated what industrialization had done to the green England of his youth, it's worth re-reading this story, if only to appreciate that his environmentalism was strong even before there was such a word. Moral: if you don't have the Lord of the Rings book in your collection, get it. Prof. Tolkien left us a rich epic, and there was only so much Mr. Jackson could put on 11 hours of film.But this is a minor footnote. I had wondered if the cinema would ever do Prof. Tolkien justice, and I must say that Peter Jackson has done so. Even in the Professor's mighty company, Mr. Jackson will not now be ashamed.&quot;Hope he rekindled, and in hope ended; over death, over dread, over doom lifted, out of loss, out of life, unto long glory.&quot;	5.0	a grim morn, and a glad day, and a glorious sunset	2004-06-11	4	4	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A38G64S5VMRI1P	Robert Graves	With Peter Jackson's final installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, he has more than crushed the concerns that the &quot;Return of the King&quot; would be subject to the same trilogy/sequel woes as &quot;The Matrix&quot; or &quot;Star Wars.&quot; Jackson truly saved his best work for last, and even long-time readers of Tolkien's series (which I am) will have very little to complain about. In &quot;Return of the King&quot; he gave us the most spectacular battle scene ever filmed, industry-changing special effects, a true adaptation that rarely deviated from the source (and when it did deviate it generally helped the story), and fine direction, getting brilliant performances out of every cast member fortunate enough to be involved with this masterpiece.The standout in this movie is Sean Astin as Sam Gamgee. Jackson has an intimate understanding of Tolkien's story, and expertly let's it blossom over three movies until we gradually realize, as we did in the books, that this is Sam's story and Sam's quest more than it is Frodo's. &quot;I may not be able to carry it for you, Mr. Frodo. But I can carry you,&quot; a teary-eyed Sam pronounces near the film's end. This is one of the better moments in the history of movie-making. Astin's performance is flawless throughout this three and a half hour epic, but somehow seems to get even better as it goes on.I felt &quot;Return of the King&quot; was far superior to &quot;The Two Towers&quot; in many respects. &quot;The Two Towers&quot; often felt disjointed and never really found its groove. Just as you were getting into the battle scenes, you were suddenly with Treebeard in dead silence, moving at a snail's pace through the forest. Jackson was able to interweave the many storylines of ROTK seamlessly, masterfully leading us to the next logical place, making the audience feel as though that's where the story *should* go, not question why it *did* go there.ROTK will probably not please everyone. Fans of Orlando Bloom will be disappointed that he is not featured, getting very little screen time. Those who criticized Jackson for using Gimli only as comic relief in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; won't find any comfort in ROTK. He probably has only one or two lines that aren't meant to inspire laughter. However, for what it's worth, I found him very funny and overall there is a much greater humor presence in ROTK than any of the other movies. Then there's the beginning, which I will agree is very slow. Unlike the testosterone-injected opening of &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; ROTK starts with a character exposition of Smeagol. I think the opening would've benefited from some more intense action.Devotees to Tolkien will surely have their pick of plots that Jackson altered, added or omitted, but I don't think they'll have much of a leg to stand on. The major changes from the books were first, the timing of the stories. The ending of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; novel actually occurs in the middle of ROTK, but this is just a function of how he chose to tell it- it doesn't necessarily alter the story, just what events appear under what title. Second, he added a conflict between Sam and Frodo, where Gollum is corrupting Frodo to turn against Sam. This however, adds a great deal of dramatic tension to the plot and doesn't change any of the character intent of Tolkien. It only magnified tensions that were already there between the two Hobbits. Then there was the scene with Shelob (the spider), which was slightly altered. In the novel Sam (and the reader) didn't find out until much later that Frodo wasn't dead but only paralyzed. Again, this didn't bother me and I'm willing to give Jackson these liberties as long as it helps his story along, not to mention the spider scene was so bone-chilling that I barely noticed any changes. Lastly though - and here I might find some merit of the critics - is the issue of Aragorn and the Palantir (the glass ball with the eye of Sauron). In the novel, Aragorn makes the decision to look into the ball deliberately in order to deceive Sauron and draw his attention from Frodo. This was very important to his character and led to him coming to terms with who he was as the King of Gondor. This was omitted almost entirely from the movie, with only a casual reference made by Gandalf. It certainly wasn't something that hurt the movie for me, and though I don't fully understand why Jackson chose this, he's more than earned the benefit of the doubt.The DVD is predictably impoverished, and I'd expect there to be at least two more packages where this is availeble. One will be the extended special features edition, and the next will be the Trilogy. If you can hold off from buying, it may be worth it, but remember that they usually structure the special features so that you'll get bonuses in this version that you won't get in others.ROTK has laugh out loud comedy, some of the most courageous acts we've seen on film, and action and effects beyond my ability to describe.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A18LW2DFS695G4	Robert	I didn't see any of the movies at the theater. I figured I wouldn't like them- overblown Hollywood hype. Now I had read the Hobbit years before and seen the Hobbit carton as a kid, and I like those stories.When my public library offered the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I checked them out and watched them. I was hooked, so hooked that I bought the movies. However, while watching the ones I bought, I swore something was missing. I did some research and found I had the theatrical release and I had watched the extended release the first time.So I had to get the extended versions, because after watching those the first time, the theatrical version just didn't seem right.As for The Return of the King- this movie is probably the most powerful of the three.Most of the characters have changed, grown and become stronger since the first movie.Theoden remains a strong character and shows why he is king.Aragorn has also been a strong character, but here he becomes a leader of men.Sam. Like Aragorn he becomes stronger.And Merry and Pippen. They have matured.Gandalf seems to purposely loose strength as he lets Aragorn get out of his shadow and become King. The old wizard is still as strong as ever, but I think he wanted Aragorn to step up as a leader. I think there is purpose in almost everything Gandalf does.And Poor Frodo.

This movie made to match the third novel in The Trilogy, met my expectations and then some.  The emotional bonds the character's had with each other holds strong through the storytelling and the battle scenes are spectacular.  The director does well to show Frodo's tortured soul as he reaches his destination in Mordor.  I think those who have read the book know how stirring the ending can be and the feeling as if you are parting from long time friends.  Some things I might have wanted to know before I went were:  there is not an epilogue that matches the book per se, but it doesn't detract from the story....most likely it would have been very anticlimatic as it is somewhat in the book.  Being a movie around three and a half hours, I expected an intermission but there is none so don't drink that 24 ounce coke like I did or you will miss some of the movie running to the bathroom.	5.0	A REVIEW FROM SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY SAW THE MOVIE!!!!	2003-12-18	1	1	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING should win the Oscar for best picture, and for three reasons:  first, it was easily the best big-budget film of the year.  The only films that I believe rival it in quality are small budget films:  LOST IN TRANSLATION and AMERICAN SPLENDOUR.  Sometimes independent films can pull upsets, but I really don't expect them to this year.  Second, except for the independent films, there isn't a lot of competition this year, unlike the past two years.  Many of the films that were expected to vie for the Oscar have been greeted with some fairly negative reviews, like COLD MOUNTAIN, or mild indifference, like THE LAST SAMURAI.  One of the better-reviewed films of the fall, MASTER AND COMMANDER, is a very good adventure film that possesses no obvious advantages over THE RETURN OF THE KING.  Third, the Academy has a tendency to correct past neglects.  Sometimes this can lead to tragic results, such as 1940 when Jimmy Stewart received the Oscar for Best Actor for THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, to atone for his having not received one in 1939 for MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON.  The tragedy lay in the fact that Stewart's best friend Henry Fonda therefore failed to win for his near legendary performance as Tom Joad in THE GRAPES OF WRATH, one of the greatest performances in the history of American cinema.  But in 2004, I expect LORD OF THE RINGS to justly win not merely for the excellence of the third installment of the saga, but for the overall greatness of the three films.The LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is unquestionably one of the most successful cinematic treatments of a beloved work of literature the movies have ever seen.  I know there are purists who would not have been satisfied by any conceivable film version, and that there are others who are more justifiably bothered by the omission of Tom Bombadil or the schizophrenic treatment of Gollum, but I think anyone willing to cut the movie even the tiniest bit of slack should be able to grant to the great achievement that this movie turned out to be.  Of course, ironically it was only the growth of CGI technology that made the filming of this fantasy of lost ancient past possible.  Twenty years ago, it would have been inconceivable that Treebeard could have been so satisfyingly come to life.  Or Gollum.  Or seeing hobbits, humans, elves, dwarves, wizards, and orcs all onscreen at the same time.  I can honestly say that there was not a moment that I was consciously looking at special effects rather than balrogs or giant flying eagles or gigantic walking trees.But all of this could be a kind of criticism--namely, that the success of the film depends merely on technology--if it weren't for the fact that the movie succeeds on multiple levels.  The art design is the most memorable I can ever remember.  I'll forever think of those beautiful pins for the capes that Frodo and Samwise wear all the way from Rivendale to Mordor.  The makers of the film got more things right than they needed to, perfecting more detail than anyone could possibly have noticed.  Without great acting, however, all of the technology and special effects and art and set design would be a royal place setting for junk, but fortunately the film was both marvelously cast and wonderfully acted.  There might have been one or two casting decisions I might have questioned, but by and large the cast was stellar, a few so magnificently that it difficult now to see anyone else in that role.  When the film was first announced, much of the debate was over who would portray Gandalf, and I remember some people being upset that not only was Sean Connery (the early favorite) not cast but an openly gay actor in the role instead.  But it is now almost impossible to imagine anyone but Ian McKellan in the role.  So many smaller roles made the film work, like David Wenham as Faramir (seen only a couple of years ago in the role of &quot;Audrey&quot; in MOULIN ROUGE), or Ian Holm as Bilbo, or Sean Bean as Boromir, or Cate Blanchett as Galadriel.  The only weakness in the movie is one that probably couldn't be overcome (and one that Peter Jackson has acknowledged in interviews):  Sauron.  What can you do with a bad guy who is merely a giant flaming eyeball?  Just not much potential to do much more than what they were able to do.Peter Jackson deserves a special academy award for serving as the creative force that turned THE LORD OF THE RINGS into one of the great experiences in the history of cinema.  Most of all, he deserves enormous credit for making all the technology subservient to the story, and not the other way around.  The great battle for Minas Tirith might have devolved into a mere showcase for stellar special effects, like many moments in the past two STAR WARS films have, but not once did he lose touch with the human element, not there or at any other point.	5.0	A stellar climax to a truly great cinematic experience	2004-01-18	202	169	33
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"Although this is the final film in a trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's novels, it is not necessary to see the other two films inorder to appreciate The King Returns...but that would certainly help. Each correctly indicates the scope and depth of Tolkien's imagination...and the nature and range of skills required of Peter Jackson when bringing the trilogy to the screen. Fortunately, modern technologies and complementary resources now enable filmmakers to create immensely complicated combinations of imagery and special effects which were previously not possible. These are essential to the visual impact of the terrain on and over which various battles occur. However, as director Jackson correctly suggests, ""In addition to these huge battles, you have these intimate stories, the emotional story, and that's where most of the power of The Return of the King really lies."" For me, that is the key to this film's critical and commercial success (e.g. nominated for and recipient of eleven Academy Awards): an epic narrative in human (or human-like) terms. This film invites at least some similarities with Tolstoy's War and Peace as well as with The Wizard of Oz and the Star Wars trilogy.Here's the basic situation. Sauron's forces have laid siege to Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, and are determined to eliminate the human race. Quite literally, the fate of Middle-earth will be determined by (a) an effective coalition of forces and (b) the emergence of a king around whom men, hobbits, elves, dwarves, etc. rally to achieve ultimate victory. Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) does all he can to buy time to prepare for the inevitable all-out attack, joined by Rohan's King Theoden (Bernard Hill). And meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood), an exhausted but determined hobbit, slowly works his perilous way through enemy lands to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom. He is accompanied by Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin). Finally, the decisive battle begins and then....The fact that this film and its director received an Academy Award but none of its actors did indicates how important teamwork must have been while bringing it to the screen. The results are truly impressive visually, of course, but more needs to be said about the film's affirmation of spiritual values amidst all the stunning special effects. I was especially touched by the hobbits who, in less capable hands than Jackson's, could have been presented as pets to be adored rather than as warriors (albeit diminutive ones) to be admired. McKellen gives the film necessary gravitas as an active, indeed engaged leader who understands better than anyone else does what must be done and how best to do it. From the beginning of the film, Viggo Mortensen is wholly credible as Aragorn.A few quibbles. For example, I could have done with fewer close-up shots of Frodo's face. Also, the pace dragged unnecessarily at times, perhaps because of the great difficulty of coordinating and sustaining at least four major story lines at the same time. Also, I wish there had been somewhat more development of the characters played by Liv Tyler (Arwen) and Cate Blanchett(Galadriel). As I said, quibbles. On balance, this is a magnificent epic and in all respects a brilliant conclusion to the trilogy of films which, I hope, will encourage many of those who see one or more of them to read Tolkien's novels."	5.0	An Eminently Worthy Conclusion to the Trilogy	2004-03-08	2	1	1

Of course, I loved the book and everything having to do with Tolkien, but as other reviewers state, I too, was afraid that the movie would ruin the book. In fact, I found the movie refreshingly similar to the book, with minor, minor changes (I do have an issue with the treatment of Boromir's brother, but nobody is perfect) and the extended version better still since by including cut footage it made the movie even more faithful to the book.I sat down one rainy Saturday and spent 11 hours watching all three episodes in extended format.... time flew.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1HCTTEYF8SZCC	Rodney Hrvatin	Much has been, and undoubtedly will be, said about Peter Jackson's remarkable trilogy of films based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. What this extended dvd does, as the other volumes in this series also did, is to show just how much love and care went into the making of this film.The exhaustive special features cover every single aspect of production and what always makes it great is that when something is mentioned we cut to footage of it actually happening. If a particular drawing is highlighted during an interview, the picture appears. This shows how keen Jackson was to let people know how it all came together. The fact that 99% of the cast and crew contribute to this dvd by way of commentary and/or interviews proves that this was indeed a happy location.Fans of the series will not wait for any reviews, they will buy it anyway, and they will not be disappointed. The new footage is interesting, if not entirely necessary. I particularly liked the Sauruman sequence, the extended paths of the dead sequence, the drinking contest between Gimli and Legolas and Mouth of Sauron sequence.The sound and picture are both superb and will definately give your widescreen tv and surround system a decent working over.This is a trilogy for the ages, and the extended cuts cement that position.

This movie works to bring the other two together and make them ultimately better too (especially the Two Towers) I did thoroughly enjoy Two Towers, but I thought that it lacked the heart and spirit that made Fellowship of the Ring so good. Return of the King not only has better action than Two Towers, but it's emotional story also beats Fellowship's.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1VNUC4KSBNTI	"rogue63 ""rogue63"""	"With all respect to Mr. Jackson and his hardworking and talented crew:  these movies are not at all acceptable.  The translation from prose to screen is difficult to overcome and often cannot be done without major revision of the source material; however, the final product must maintain a great degree of life on its own, either apart from or related to the original.  Stephen King's ""The Shining"" is quite different from Kubrick's movie, and yet both retain an equally powerful story, and Kubrick's movie does not suffer precisely because he is willing to rework and cut and create as he sees fit for his own vision.  I cannot see that Mr. Jackson has the same degree of vision for his movies.  The source material for the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies is simply too strong and earth-rooted to come alive on screen, and Mr. Jackson is hampered by a fear of making his viewers think and reflect and a greater fear of giving them time to do so.  Perhaps that is my own cherished prejudice leaping up, but these movies simply do not have a kind of real life and energy.  Where the quiet attention to setting that Tolkien so loved?  Where the noble strains of antiquity and reverence?  These movies have all of the style and none of the substance of a great masterwork.  Furthermore, CGI is never acceptable in a movie, for any reason.  Why should we watch a grouping of pixels from a computer screen instead of a live actor?  The Gollum character could EASILY have been performed by a live actor in makeup and costume, and probably with much less trouble and more real chemistry on screen.  Oh heavens, there are a thousand things to lament but the final conclusion is that these movies are sadly not at all a relative of their original text.  Flaccid dialogue, weak acting, overwrought scenes hampered by too much flash.  Mr. Jackson and his colleagues have created a marvelous spectacle indeed, but no movie, and we hope that he and his colleagues will retire to the circus where just such flash and blow belongs."	1.0	A Sad Disappointment	2003-12-06	179	19	160

It is what Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and so many others strove for and missed time and again. Peter Jackson has raised the bar for every director of the future with The Return of the King, the breathtaking finale of The Lord of the Rings.Fantasy, action, drama, romance, humor - nearly every genre can be found to some degree in this film. From the unexpected beginning, which details the chance finding of the Ring at the bottom of a lake, to the action-packed climax and satisfying ending, The Return of the King is a beautiful final chapter of Tolkien's saga. Fair warning, though: it is about two minutes shy of four hours long by the time the credits roll.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	?The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King? - though, in my view, not quite as compelling as the monumental ?The Two Towers? that directly preceded it - is, nevertheless, a worthy conclusion to this one-of-a-kind cinematic achievement.  In the final installment of the trilogy, the hobbit Frodo, his loyal companion, Sam, and the nefarious cretin Gollum, are still heading toward Mount Doom to destroy the ring which threatens to hold the world in its diabolical grasp.  Meanwhile a whole host of other characters do further battle with the forces of evil massing to take over Middle-Earth.Under Peter Jackson?s skillful directorial guidance, never have the resources of cinema ? cinematography, art direction, matte design, special effects ? been marshaled with more effectiveness in bringing a fantasy world to vivid life.  As with ?The Two Towers,? the eyes pop and the jaw drops at the sheer magnificence of the spectacle taking place on screen.  The seemingly endless vistas, sweeping camera movements, ferocious battle sequences and one truly terrifying giant spider offer some of the most visually astonishing moments in motion picture history.  It will be a long time before we encounter a film project of this size and scope again.What struck me most while watching ?The Return of the King? was how Tolkien had created a view of the Middle Ages as it might have been had Christianity never existed ? a view that film, by its intrinsically visual nature, only enhances.  As the camera scans the horizon, we are struck by the fact that there are no cathedrals, no country churches, no spires dominating the landscape.  In a similar way, there are no clergy present, no Christian symbols such as crosses or rosary beads, no sacred artwork ? all visuals that define our image of the Middle Ages.  Instead of priests there are wizards and elves; instead of crucifixes, we find magic rings and New Age medallions.  ?The Return of the King? allows us to re-imagine a period in history, bereft of the single most dominating influence that came to define that era.  It?s still the classic battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil that have defined human history - but as filtered through Tolkien?s Teutonic imagination and vision, that conflict becomes the stuff of mythology and legend.In the mass of special effects, it?s easy to overlook the fine performances of Elijah Woods as Frodo, Sean Astin as Sam, and Andy Serkis as Gollum, who together provide the heart and soul needed to keep this sprawling epic tale life-sized and moving.If truth be told, impressive as this film undoubtedly is, a certain ? perhaps inevitable - fatigue factor does creep in during portions of this third installment.  Perhaps the elements that seemed so fresh in ?The Two Towers? ? the epic battle scenes, on a scale far grander than any we had ever before encountered, or the schizophrenic conflict between good and evil being waged inside Gollum?s twisted psyche ? seem like just more of the same here.  Unlike the second part, ?The Return of the King? provides little that is new to take us to that higher level we keep hoping for and expecting.That being said, I must also add that the emotional impact of the final moments is simply overwhelming, as the characters we have come to know and love over the course of the tale engage in the most moving scenes of leave-taking and parting since ?The Wizard of Oz? and ?E.T.?  There are some who have balked at the sentimental nature of these moments, calling them anticlimactic and self-indulgent, yet after having invested so much time getting to know these characters and sharing in their adventure, the audience has earned the right to a bit of over-the-top sentiment, and I see no reason to criticize the filmmakers for pulling out all the emotional stops here.  If anything, these scenes demonstrate the intense bond Jackson and his crew have forged with their legions of loyal, appreciative fans.There?s no doubt about it, taken as a whole, this nine-hour-plus saga of ?The Lord of the Rings? is one of the great epic experiences of our time.	5.0	a monumental achievement	2004-07-21	2	1	1

As the movie progressed, the story became fragmented. I had enough of Sam's whining and crying and Frodo's tedious exhaustion.  We know that the closer he gets to the volcano, the more difficult it becomes for him but give me a break!  I wanted to push Frodo off the cliff into the molten lava to put him out of his misery to end the lengthy movie!There was gratuitous violence in this movie such as that hideous Orc thrusting a pike into the downed yet alive man.  That truly wasn't necessary for we know the viciousness of these creatures.  Some most improbable occurences were the ""woman"" slicing the head off one of the flying monsters so easily when those powerful creatures scooped up and flung warriors around at their will, and Legolas so gracefully scaling the elephant and cutting one rope which made everything fall off the animal.  Not to mention that the steward who wanted to burn his son alive managed to run out of the building through a courtyard and off a cliff while engulfed in flames!  I realize the story is a fantasy but he was a MAN - not an orc, a dwarf, or an elf.Plus, most of the special effects were just awful in comparison with the first two films.  So obvious and fake.  We can't see how children were used to portray the hobbits? Or how Merri and Pippin were made to look so much smaller?  We couldn't tell the actors were standing in front of a screen?  Where was the wonderful cinematography?But the most annoying part of the film was ending.  When Aragorn was made king and he sang...  What was that?  Surprise -Liv Tyler appeared...  Great, Aragorn had his true love again but what about Arowyn who followed him against her father's wishes to be with and fight alongside the new ""king?""  That was a love story, too - part of the movie's story. Do we just forget about her?  Then we see Sam married?!  The way Sam and Frodo were acting I think they should have married!  Then Frodo goes off unexpectedly and unexplainedly?I have read the books, The Hobbit and The Trilogy, and know what a gigantic undertaking it was to make feature films from these stories.  There were some light, comedic moments that bring a smile or a laugh like Gimli stating the odds of a battle.  However, the creation of this film seemed hurried.  The first two were successes but for the last I cannot say the same.  I just couldn't wait for the film to end.  Too bad Peter Jackson was not honored with an award for one of his first two films for I do not believe he will get one for this unless those who make these decisions bestow it upon him just ""because."""	2.0	Very Disappointing	2003-12-28	39	7	32

There's more on Denethor than meets the eye.- Peregrin of the tower guard. Another one from the book.- The Corsairs of Umbar. Check out Peter Jackson's cameo here... with the whole production team!- The Witch King's hour. Originally seen in the trailer for the movie, the confrontation between Gandalf and the Witch King is here!- The Houses of the Healing. Featuring a song by Liv Tyler, beautiful.- Aragorn masters the Palantir. He shows to Sauron himself!- In the company of Orcs. Frodo and Sam march in Orc lines just as they do in book 3!- The Mouth of Sauron. The evil character who greets the Fellowship at the Black gates.And of course there are new scenes that represent minor changes but that add more depth to every single character in the film.The extra material as usual is the most comprehensive documentary I have ever seen in DVD history (think about it, 6 discs full of additional material), including some abandoned and actually filmed concepts featuring Aragorn fighting Sauron himself!One recommendation though, if you haven't bought this 4 disc set, go for the special edition set that includes a miniature of Minas Tirith beautifully crafted by Weta Designers and a bonus DVD featuring excerpts from Howard Shore's live presentations of the film's music. The two extras are worth the $20 difference.	5.0	A whole DVD experience	2005-02-05	4	4	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2RH5TDDHDPX9R	R. Tseng	The Lotr trilogy is simply a great achievement in cinema. I must echo the sentiment that these are FILMS, movies, and must be enjoyed as such. I read the books after the movie version The Two Towers because I couldn't wait for the Return of the King. The book is wonderful of course, and I was imagining each shot on the screen as I read. But that created the problem when I saw Return of the King, I was unconsciously comparing the movie to the book. Yes some stories were cut and lines were switched, but most importantly I was just waiting to see what I already know is going to happen. I think I understand a little bit about the disappointment of expectation when juggling between the book and film, or one's own imagination and someone else's vision.Yet from all that I saw in the theater, DVD, as well as magazine and online reviews, I'm convinced that Peter Jackson and Co. have made these films with love, respect, dignity, superb creativity and skills. There are so much attention to detail, think about casting, costume, weapons and make ups, not to mention cinematography, scores, FX and acting. Perhaps I'm just a kid at heart, but I was, and still am, moved when Frodo volunteer to take the ring to Mordor, terrified at Helm's Deep and touched again when all bowed down to the hobbits...now if that's cheesy so be it, I ENJOYED every minute of it!I have watched the films over and over again (Fotr is still my favorite) and have not lose one bit of excitement but have actually discover something new each time. So I too, appreciate and thank Peter Jackson and all that was involved for the great cinema experience!	5.0	Great cinematic achievement	2004-12-10	3	3	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1JUYF5D6TFFHB	"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya"""	"Lord Of The Rings concludes with ""The Return Of The King"". J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this some time around World War II, and I sincerely believe he intended to make it a fantasy parallel of his times. On DVD, this masterpiece, which graced the big screens in theatres last year's winter, makes a great DVD. Make it the third in your collected series of the two previous- The Two Towers and The Fellowship Of The Ring. Stars Virgo Mortensen as Aragon, Orland Bloom as Legolas and the main stars Elijah Wood as Frodo and Ian Mckellen as Gandalf. The film resumes where Two Towers left off. Gollum leads Frodo and Sam into Mordor and up Mount Doom, all the while scheming how to get his ""precious"" ring back to himself. In the meantime, the ultimate battle between good and evil rages as Gandalf, Aragonand the other hobbits fight the bad guys. The fighting scenes are intense and quite graphic, and the special effects are at an all time best in this film- castles, monsters, crowd scenes in battle, the destruction of Mordoer. Great cinematography, stunts and as always beautiful music by Howard Shore. Why did'nt they get John Williams ? O right. He's busy doing the score to the final Star Wars film installment. This is a great movie, heart-warming in its finale and a moving experience. Look for lots of great features, including behind the scenes footage and commentary and even a video game."	5.0	The Epic Finale To The Ring On DVD	2004-05-19	3	2	1

I always held The Star Wars Series, new and old at the top of the list as far as epic stories, but after watching the Lord of the Rings, I have a new number 1.  Pete Jackson does an amazing job of bringing Middle Earth to life.  There is so much texture and so much detail that it just makes feel as though you are there.

Yes, this extended version is better then the original - more coherent, more Tolkienesque.How much better you say? The famiy decided we were going to  watch it over two nights as 4 hours and 10 minutes was just too much to take in one sitting. Once stated however, no one wanted to stop. The time seemed to fly.

McCloskey ""Korn in my sh*t"""	"Peter Jackson should be strung up in everyone's eyes for this.  It is absolutely amazing to me that he can completely cut the last 50 pages out of the book for this movie, and put ""The Lord of the Rings"" label on it.  Don't get me wrong, it is a well-made movie, but all of the cutting out of parts of the book ruined it for me.For example, where did Saruman go?  He was in the tower, and then he just disappeared, never to be seen again? The book doesn't tell it that way.  If I had never read the books I would probably like this movie, but having read them, I stomped out of the theater in disbelief and anger after it was over.  If you are expecting a movie true to the books, and haven't seen the movie, save yourself the time and frustration."	2.0	2 stars only for the CG and action sequences....	2005-04-01	13	2	11

The story never ever lets up in stunning visuals, and heartthrobbing story.  Nothing is really left unsaid.  Unexplained.  It was all there.  I cant count how many times I was ready to burst in tears from what I was watching of screen.  This is the best ENDING film that will EVER be created.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2ZQ75P93V9MX9	Ryan R. Grant	I have read many reviews criticizing Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord of the Rings on the basis of this was left out of the book, and this was left out, etc. I'm not a purist, and any intellegent person will have to acknowledge there is no way to get the entirety, precision and beauty of the entire book onscreen. Jackson deserves praise and applause on this account, that he did a stupendous job, particularly with Fellowship.Return of the King however lacks not only the details, but the spirit of Tolkein's work. It is one thing to alter something for the sake of cinematic adaptation, but it is quite another to change things that bring no cinematic value to the picture, and in fact take away from the story, such as the expansion of Arwen's character into a role that is non-existant in the book. Particularly devistating is the scene where Frodo tells Sam to leave. This is a dramatic departure from the story, which provides no cinematic value. Frodo would NEVER send Sam away, and Sam would never leave! I cringe whenever the part comes up.The battle scenes are also too long, without enough substance, and the Elephants are strangely remeniscient of the walkers in Empire Strikes back. (It should be also noted that George Lucas was on the set giving advice to Jackson. Considering the fate of Star Wars, it is no suprise to see a lessening quality in Return of the King). In addition, the way Tolkein had it written in the book was far better, and easily adaptable to cinema. Instead Jackson cut the knights of Dol Amroth, who leave the gates of Minas Tirith as soon as Rohan comes to join the battle, as well as the battles with the armies of Haradrim on foot. He departs from the fact that no enemy ever set foot in Minas Tirith except the Witchking, and cut a dramatically stunning face-off between Gandalf and the Witchking, which is interupted by Rohan's coming. Instead this was replaced with endless fighting within Gondor's gates which just gets boring. All of these things rather than enhancing cinematic value, took away from the story, producing long battle scenes with little plot, drama or substance, other than the fact that the good guys will eventually win somehow.Thus as a whole, the cinematic quality of the movie was low, in comparison with the Fellowship which is stupendous. Yet the whole substance wasn't lost, thus I give 2 stars.	2.0	Lacking the Spirit of Tolkein	2004-10-04	160	46	114
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3L9FTW01LMYSE	Ryne	I will admit that I was never a Lord of the Rings fan until I saw this installment of the three films.  This film blew me away.  The acting, the special effects, the story, and the score all came together in a beautiful blend of pure cinema.  This time around every aspect of the story is kicked up a notch, especially in the acting.  Elijah Wood made Froddo Baggins more relatable. Viggo Mortensen immortalizes Aragorn, with his brilliant acting and star quality.  Liv Tyler, Ian Mckellen, and Cate Blanchett all were wonderful as usual.  The best of all the acting in this film comes from Sean Astin.  Samwise Gambji's character was given more depth and realism, and the raw emotion that Astin gave the audience was truly amazing to see on film. This film should be seen by everyone and will definately be around for many generations to come.  A masterpiece.	5.0	The Lord of the Rings:  The Return of the King:  A+	2004-08-05	6	6	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1B9RL9DGJ97NE	Ryne Williams	"In that last installment of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings saga, director Peter Jackson has crafted a cinematic masterpiece that makes for a triumphant end to a legendary film series.Every aspect of the series has improved but it improves in a way that doesn't upstage the first two films. The story has gradually become more compelling in part because the audience doesn't have to deal with ""to be continued"". Also the special effect have reached a critical mass that will amaze anyone especially in the epic battle sequenc of Minas Tirith. Each of the characters have also reached a deeper level of depth. Even the usually bumbling Pippin and Merry mature as the evil force of Sauron draws near.Overall this film will find its place in our history as being one of the greatest film epics of all time. It is a movie that doesn't reflect the times we are living in now, but instead reminds us of the smaller things in life, despite the grand scope of the film. I think that this movie should be viewed by everyone, but mostly those who have already seen the first two films. I enjoyed it without watching The Fellowship of the Ring or The Two Towers but looking back I wish I had seen the first installments prior to going to the theatre. Regardless you will be amazed and certainly not disappointed by this phenomenal film that will continue to enthrall and amaze as time passes and more movies are made."	5.0	A Triumphant End To A Legendary Film Series	2005-03-21	2	1	1

I saw this movie thinking it was no big deal, like it was JUST another movie.  I was amazed when I saw this film!  The cinematography, the acting, and all the other cinamatic elements all came together in a surprising blend of action, fantasy.  You do not even have to see the first two films in order to love this movie, but it helps.  There were zero disappointments and I was completely satisfied with the end result.  Everyone should see these films.  They are the Star Wars of our time.  It however isn't my favorite movie, of the year, but it is definately the second.

Its the best movie I have  ever seen. Im a BIG fan of the movies and a big fan of the books, and I was very sad to see these movies come to and end. These are movies that inspired me to go to Film School. The 50 mintues of Extra footage in the movies are amazing. I still feel the film is a little short.LOL. I wish it could have been 5 hours long instead of 4 hours and 10 minutes.I love these new scenes the most1. The Decline of Gondor - This is a very good scene with Gandalf telling Pippin all about the history of the Gondorians and the White Tree of Gondor, and how the Gondorian Kingdom has declined  since it has been a Kingless country.2. The Road To Isengard - This is nice little sequence that shows the end of Saruman the White. And the last confrontation between Saruman and the Fellowship is very good.They Could Have Added More Footage To...1. The Siege Of Gondor - I feel this battle is still a little short even with the extra footage.2. Breaking The Gate Of Gondor - It needs more footage.3. The Witch-Kings Hour - could of had more talking between Gandalf and the Witch-King.4. The Battle Of Pelennor Fields - This could have had a whole lot more footage...I mean it is suppose to be the Greatest Battle of the 3rd Age5. Victory At Minas Tirtih - This should of had more footage in it.6. The Fight outside the Black Gate should have had more footage7. Return To Edoras - should have had more footage8. The Return Of the King - could of possibly had a little bit more added to it.9. I think the should have added more footage to the end of the movie. They should have showed what happened to Legolas and GimliBUT OVERALL this is the most amazing movie. The years of work the cast and crew put into these films really payed off. They deserved to win all 11 Oscars. But like I said...It's still kind of short to me...Lol I think they could have used more footage. But anyway it goes it is still a AWESOME MOVIE.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2BGDXUHX6J4E8	Samantha Stephens	"The extended DVD of ""Return of the King"" is filled with many new and extended scenes that will please fans who love Tolkien's original story.  The July 26, 2004 San Diego Comic Convention featured a preview of many scenes, some introduced by Peter Jackson himself.  (Some of these scenes were recently featured in the sneak preview trailer at Lord of the Rings.net, although now it seems to have been removed).  In reference to a couple of reviews on the board here -- if you're waiting anxiously for the Scouring of the Shire, don't hold your breath.  That segment was NEVER filmed by Jackson, therefore it will NOT be included in the extended edition DVD.  But there ARE plenty of great scenes to be included:  We hear Christopher Lee's booming voice echoed over a dark screen that lightened to reveal Saruman on top of Orthanc. He warns our heroes of something festering in the heart of Middle-earth and that they will all die.  We see Frodo and Sam in their Orc disguises joining the column of Orcs as they march out of Mordor.  There are numerous shots of the Houses of Healing with Faramir, Eowyn, and Merry all seen.  A lot more looks to be added to the siege of Minas Tirith, as there was a bunch of new battle footage.  Frodo and Sam venture into the Crossroads and a few clips from that section were included.  The Mouth of Sauron is featured pretty heavily. If you've played EA's Return of the King video game you'll recognize the scene. The Mouth of Sauron rides out of the Black Gate and presents Frodo's mithril coat to the Fellowship.  Aragorn reveals himself to Sauron by approaching the Palantir in Minas Tirith and wields Anduril to show that the Heir of Elendil was alive.  We get to see more of Saruman later in the preview when he knocks Wormtongue down and also fires a giant fireball from his staff that engulfs Gandalf on Shadowfax.  There's more of Frodo and Sam in Mordor after they join the column of Orcs and before they discard their disguises. In one scene, Sam looks to the dark sky of Mordor and tells Frodo that he can see light as one little star can be seen glimmering through the clouds.  And yes, we will finally get to see Gandalf facing down the Witch King. It happens exactly as we've seen, but when Gandalf holds up his staff the Witch King pulls out his sword and holds it to the sky where it spouts flames. As he brings it down, the air around the burning sword is distorted.That was just the preview. New Line treated fans to three full clips, with the third introduced by Peter Jackson himself:  There was a nice scene of Pippin and Faramir in Gondor where Faramir explains to the Hobbit how the small Gondorian armor he was wearing belonged to a young son of the Steward when he was a kid. Faramir further explains how Boromir was always the soldier and he wasn't.  A scene that takes place about five days after they were healed by Aragorn features Faramir and Eowyn on a balcony at the Houses of Healing where Eowyn falls for Faramir.  The Paths of the Dead is extended from where it ends in the theatrical cut. After Aragorn poses his offer, the dead laugh and go back into the walls. A massive earthquake starts, and the Three Hunters must escape an avalanche of millions of skulls.  Described, but not shown, another scene expanded in this edition is the scene where Pippin finds Merry on the battlefield. Now, Pippin searches the field for an entire day after everyone else has gone back into the city. He finally locates Merry at night in the new version of the scene.Just a few weeks to go till the ""Return of the King"" extended edition hits the stores!"	5.0	New scenes and unseens	2004-11-16	189	177	12

I think that the three LoR movies might even surpass the Star Wars Triology as the greatest Movie Triology ever.  My only complaint was the the Scouring of the Shire was not placed in the movies because it gives a little purpose to both Merry and Pippin at the end.  But outside of that the movie was wonderfully done.  The last few final scenes were powerful.  As for the technical stuff, the widescreen ofcourse is the way to go, the audio is great especially heard with surround sound.  The video quality sharp and crisp.  The disc is loaded with speical features.  I waited and got the Triology as one set and of course I have the extended versions as well, which I think are much better then these versions.

The Biggest plus in the restore is the Christopher Lee  work that just has tremendous implications for the film story. It is utterly incomprehensible as to why Lee's pivotal performance would be cut, when it is his sequence that provides the drama for next half hour or so.Restoring many lost elements so that the story is coherant is superb.Hopefully the Blue Ray  discs will allow the entire film to be put on one DVD.Absolutely love this version.	5.0	Excellent DVD  version with one pain	2004-12-17	2	1	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1E2S8WO1RKSSW	"Sara E. Davies ""cat_in_former_life"""	The extended scenes in Return of the King generally add information and/or atmosphere, but not as consistently as the extended scenes in both Fellowship and Two Towers. The editing seems to have been done less carefully in terms of overall cohesiveness of timing and flow, and also in staying true to the characters based on what they are like in the previous two films. I didn't see the kind of closure I hoped for with Eowyn & Faramir, and I wish more had been done to describe Aragorn's medical abilities. That being said I prefer the extended version to the theatrical release and give it five stars because I gave the first two movies five stars, and see the trilogy as a whole.	5.0	Mostly Better; Sometimes Just More	2004-12-19	2	2	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AQM2ADBR0TYSO	Sarah Schenkkan	"Seeing as the first two parts of the ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy were some of the most critically acclaimed, visually spectacular, and highest-grossing movie events in film history, the last and final part, ""The Return of the King"" certainly had high expectations to live up to. But, after a long year of waiting, the conclusion to the journey of Frodo and Sam meets and goes beyond all boundaries to create a truly remarkable cinematic experience. Directly after the lights begin to dim, we as the audience find ourselves already emmersed in the story of men, wizards, elves, and of course, hobbits. Much like ""The Two Towers"", the original fellowship of nine has split up, each involved in their own plotlines, and each with their own missions to fufill. Aragorn, on a tumultous road to the throne of Gondor, rides with Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, as they defend the last city of men, Minas Tirith. Merry and Pippin are in Rohan with the newly introduced characters Theodin and Eowyn, while, in the most important plotline, Frodo, Sam, and Golem continue their treacherous journey to Mordor to destroy the One Ring. While there are many to follow, each plot brings a new kind of excitement and suspense to the big picture, keeping the audience completely enthralled on the edge of their seats.Aside from the plots, the acting and special effects are what makes this an amazing movie. As far as acting is concerned, ""Return of the King"" is the most emotionally charged part of the Lord of the Rings saga; all of the performances are solid, with each actor completely absorbing their character and the events taking place around them. One of the best, in my opinion, is the raw, complex and heroic portrayal of bumbling hobbit Samwise Gamgee (played by Sean Astin), but Elijah Wood (as the ring bearer Frodo Baggins), Ian McKellan (as Gandalf), Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan (Pippin and Merry, respectively), and Viggo Mortensen (as Aragorn) all provide a strong and talented ensemble. Another high point is the performance by Andy Serkis, as the hobbit Smeagol and later as the cave dwelling creature Gollum (personally, my favorite), as he delivers an almost flawless portrayal of a pathetic, and dark character, easily corrupted by the power of The Ring. As I said before, this film deserves much praise for their special effects, which to say the least, are breathtaking. From their huge battles, to the insides of Mordor and Rivendell, to the overall beauty of Middle Earth itself, ""Return of the King"" is a feast for the eyes, and it breaks all boundaries of modern fantasy filmmaking. Director Peter Jackson should recieve an Oscar, or at least a nomination for his brilliance in creative views, layouts, and his skill in creating these movies.Overall, ""Return of the King"" is one of, if not the best film of 2003, and with its talented cast and visually stunning sets and CGI effects, it will satisfy any ""Lord of the Rings"" fanatic, or anyone wanting to spend three hours completely absorbed in a compelling and breathtaking story."	5.0	"Long-Awaited ""Return"" is King"	2003-12-19	3	3	0

And, I must say that it has stayed in my five-player DVD on constant repeat. I just can't get enough!First of all, let me say that the storyline and premise of this epic adventure is wonderful. It far surpasses many other movies of it's type. It definitely deserves the 11 academy awards it recieved, and the adulation from the fans world-wide.The story picks off were The Two Towers left off. Frodo and Sam are still struggling to make it to Mordor. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolos are trying to do all they can to stem the tide of Sauron. Man (Aragorn), Elf (Legolas), and Dwarf (Gimli), and their united fellowship is all that has stemmed the tide thus far. But, in this movie every element of thier friendship is tested. The absolute coming of war, the strain of sustaining strength against the coming wave, and the test of love. Yet, the three friends remain true to one another and their fellowship. Especially, the friendship between the Dwarf and the Elf are wonderful for all of 'movie-going man' to see.Ultimately, the story ends with this latest saga and although many claim the end of the movie to be too long and overdrawn. You would be intrisically lost did you not truly discover the destiny of all our heroes. I personally think that Tolkien would turn over in his grave were it not represented.If you don't own the epics...&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;...I suggestion you purchase them immediately. For kids, adults, and elderly folk they are three movies worth seeing. And, for me, &quot;The Return of the King&quot; represents the best of the installment.Happy watching!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1CITRQE2HRW45	"Scamp Lumm ""Littlesorrel/christian zionist"""	Those little creatures with the little furry feet save the day in this final film of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  This movie was my favorite of the three, The Two Towers my least favorite, The Fellowship of the Ring my second favorite.  (The timing of the release of The Two Towers kind of gave me the creeps).  This film was meant to be the grand finale, and Peter Jackson, the Academy winner in 2003, pulled it off.  The supplemental dvd explains a little about the behind the scenes work that went on and explains how faithfully Peter Jackson tried to create the story as the book describes it.  I read the entire trilogy as a child when I was 10 or so years old, (a long time ago)!  Haven't read it since, yet as I watched the whole series, I began to remember how I had pictured the story in my mind as I had read it decades ago and began to recall (vaguely) what I had read.  I think that's a testimony, to me at least, of Jackson's work.  (I don't recall the Aragorn/Arwen love story at all; I think Jackson just threw that whole thing in the trilogy to spice things up a bit!)  As much as I love watching Orlando and Viggo, this movie to me was a movie about hobbit heroism, and I loved watching the close friendship that had to develop between the hobbit foursome during this perilous quest especially in this last film.  None of the actors got any awards for this movie, yet nearly all the behind the scenes crew did.  Jackson did a spectacular job all around, and was very careful in picking a cast that would work well together during the 3-4 years it took to complete the Trilogy filming.  The Lord of the Rings was written by J. R. R. Tolkien, published in 1954.  What I loved about reading the trilogy, was how Tolkien portrayed good and evil throughout the work.  The story, yes, and especially in The Return of the King, is about the battle between good and evil, the hobbits, the elves, and humans versus Sauron and his evil band, yet there is evil within the heart of everyone as Frodo (Elijah Wood) must grapple with the ring's power to stir up this covetous/idolatrous character flaw within us all.  It's no wonder that Tolkien was raised christian, and this constant inner battle is analogous to the working of the Holy Spirit, the process of sanctification, within those who have given their lives to Christ.  I was on the edge of my seat during the final battle scene, nearly moved to tears.  My favorite scene was the one where Pippin (Billy Boyd) sings a song a capella whilst the battle rages.  No one ever mentions that scene or his singing, but I was really moved by it.  So many of the actors were not top billing in any movies before The Lord of the Rings, but they all performed so well.  Would that these furry-feeted people really existed, would that the world resembled the hobbits' shire.	5.0	HOBBITS RULE!	2005-04-10	3	2	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2I7ZAB04Q0DML	Scott Kolecki	"The masterpiece of our time has arrived on DVD.Each installment of Peter Jackson's masterful interpretation of the classic novel by J.R.R. Tolkien have been incredible, weaving an intricate and beautiful story into images that are completely mesmerizing, allowing the viewer the chance to experience Tolkien as never before.  Yet, as good as the first two installments, the massive and robust ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", and ""The Two Towers"" are, ""Return of the King"" is that much better.This third and concluding chapter in the ""Ring"" series draws together the quest that was begun with the fellowship of nine in the original film. As Mordor prepares to launch war on Middle-Earth, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), under the mis-direction of Gollum are nearing their destination, Mt. Doom, where the one-ring can finally be destroyed. Gollum, whose mind has long been corrupted by the ring, has devised a plan to kill Frodo and Sam so that he can re-claim the ring for himself.Elsewhere, Aragorn (Viggo Mortinsen), Theodin (Bernard Hill), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhyes-Davies) and the powerful wizard Gandalf (the incredible Ian McKellan), are preparing for the ensuing battle that is about to be unleashed on the kingly city, Gandor. In a desperate effort to raise an army, this small alliance of man, elf, dwarf and wizard set out to recruit every able-bodied man to fight in a war that will decide forever the fate of Middle Earth.The massive scope of this film is, at times, unbelievable, in that it is far more colossal than any depiction of war ever seen on screen. The battle sequences, which contain armies in the tens of thousands, are filmed with a level of complexity that put audiences on the battlefield with the characters on screen. At the same time, the film balances the intense war sequences with the tender and intimate relationships that defined the fellowship from the very beginning.As Sam and Frodo, in the final third of the film, are about to enter Mt. Doom, Frodo collapses, and, in a performance worthy of the Oscars, Sam consoles his friend, and then lifts him onto his shoulders to help Frodo complete the journey they set out on together. The moment is tender, in spite of the intense situation they find themselves in. It is that balance of humanity and action that makes the movie more than a fantasy story, but rather a true epic in every sense of the word.Everything, from the ground-breaking special effects, to the costumes, weapons, sets and set-pieces are so well thought-out, so completely and meticulously detailed, that Middle Earth truly feels like a real place; like something lifted out of history instead of simply a fictional world created for a movie. The beautiful city of Gondor is breath-taking: set in the side of a mountain, it looks like one of the great cities found in Italy during the hightimes of the Roman empire. In contrast, the horrific realm of Mordor oozes with the abysmal darkness of an evil that is both ancient and powerful.If there is going to be a set of films that will define as this time-periods classics, then the entire ""Lord of the Rings"" series could very well be the ones, with ""The Return of the King"" standing as a pinnacle in the achievements of one director's vision to bring to life one of the most beloved, most read novels of all time.  Already, this film has been recognized by every major film association, sweeping awards in both the Golden Globes (winning the best picture amongst others) as well as the highest achievement in film, the coveted best picture Academy Award (in addition to a phenomenal 10 other awards including best director (Peter Jackson)).Critics from around the world have celebrated this film, and almost universally it is agreed that this is one of the great ones, and as a film, even amongst the other installments of this trilogy, it stands alone. Aptly named ""The Return of the King"", its majesty is untouchable...and it truly is the crowning masterpiece of the ""Ring"" series, and, undeniably, one of the greatest films of our time.-Scott Kolecki"	5.0	"Bring Home the Majesty of ""The Return of the King"""	2004-03-17	3	3	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"Peter Jackson's interpretation of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy sets a number of high water marks for modern film, and ""The Return of the King"" meets the seemingly impossible feat of surpassing the expectations Jackson set with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers.""Tolkien once famously said that he thought that his novels were essentially unfilmable, which is why he let the movie rights go for a pittance (this is one of the stories you learn in one of the excellently informative documentaries about the movie contained on Discs 3 and 4).  Jackson proved the master wrong (to a point), using an unusual combination of fidelity to the original source material as well as taking the story in some new, more cinematic ways.  Those looking for a shot-for-shot retelling of Tolkien's novels will be disappointed, but Tolkien was probably right that as written, his novels were great novels but would be poor screenplays.Quite simply, Tolkien's world and his story was too vast to be contained in a mere film - that's why you see so many dog-eared copies of his books, worn out by repeat readings.  Jackson came about as close as you could to telling the whole story in his movies, but he realized that changes needed to be made.  In doing so, Jackson still created a rich, vibrant world with sufficient depth and detail that it's worth romping through again and again, and this extended version of the original film allows those of us with a passion for the War of the Ring to roll up our sleeves and dive in once again.I'll leave it to others to summarize the plot points and excellent ""extras"" and extended/new scenes this 4-disc collection provides.  I'll focus on the reactions that we had when we had a recent party to watch this Extended Edition for the first time:- Outright cheering when the Riders of Rohan charge the orcs on the Battle of Pellenor Fields, when Pippin lights the beacons to call Rohan to battle, when Legolas single-handedly brings down a Mumakil, and when Eowyn takes out the Witch-King.- Laughter when Sam takes out an orc ""and that's for my Old Gaffer!"" and when Merry and Pippin get stoned on the ruins of Isengard.- Gasps in horror as Frodo and Sam battle the monstrous spider Shelob and when Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas walk the Paths of the Dead, and during the debate with the Mouth of Sauron.- Stark silence broken by sobs when Sam picks up Frodo to carry him on Mount Doom, when Eowyn meets the Theoden for the last time, and of course at the Grey Havens.- Calls for ""start it again!"" when Sam finally says, ""Well, I'm back.""- And speculation of Roger Ebert's motives when he gave this movie only three and a half stars, complaining that Jackson's story left genuine human emotion aside in exchange for ""surface and archetype, oddly invoking ""Apocalypse Now"" as an exemplar of the former.  (If anything, ""Return of the King"" is the most focused on emotion and multi-layered conflict of the three films, and by the time Sam returns to Hobbiton to reunite with his family, you feel like you've been through an emotional wringer.  Sure, dedication, hope and despair, and self-sacrifice may not be the most nuanced of emotions, but to criticize this movie for its absence of emotional heft is just plain anti-fantasy snobbery.)Of all the times I've watched movies with friends and family, I've never seen a stronger, more emotional reaction to a movie (which is saying something, considering we were cramped in a small viewing area for just over 4 hours).  From Howard Shore's original music, to the wonderful artistic renditions of Middle Earth, to the outstanding special effects and the pitch-perfect acting, ""The Return of the King"" is an example of just how darn good movies can be.  My biggest concern is that I'll watch it too much!I'll only say one thing more about the extras available on this DVD.  One feature talks about the connection between the Academy Award-winning song, ""Into the West,"" sung by Annie Lennox, and a teenage director who grew very close to Peter Jackson's crew before losing a battle with cancer.  If you didn't get misty listening to ""Into the West,"" which is a song about Frodo's journey from the Grey Havens, you will when you connect it to the story of this remarkable young man.This entire trilogy is a must for the film library, and the extended special editions of the DVDs are excellent versions."	5.0	The definitive capper to the definitive movie trilogy -- astounding	2006-02-20	2	1	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2B2K2WS1125S0	"Scott S. Weinrich ""Movie Fan"""	First of all, this movie is based on a book.  It is not THE book.  Comparisons between the two may hold some value but the movie should not be based solely on them.  Everyone has an idea of what should be or shouldn't be in this movie and yet, did you make the movie?  No.  This was Jackson's love and his task.  Very few, if any, would dare to take on the job of making this movie or the first two for that matter.  So, thank you Peter Jackson for bringing these books to the screen.Another thing is, we are all rating an item that none of us have seen yet.  But, if it has the same result as the first two extended editions, this release will be superb.  The scenes that are to be added back in, should add alot to the film for fans.The Return Of The King was an excellent movie, especially if you never read the book.  But even for those of us that have, if you can remember that cinema and novels differ in many ways, you should be able to enjoy the film.The one thing that really comes across in this movie is this.  No matter who you are, how big or small you are, or where you are from or where you are going, you CAN make a difference.  It also reinforces the thought that good, in the end, will always defeat evil.One other thought, and that has to do with the ending, or ENDINGS, as some of you feel.  The Lord of the Rings is one big 9+ hour movie.  Where does the beginning end and the middle start?  For me, it is at the meeting at the house of Elrond where the fellowship is formed.  Some might feel that it is when Frodo and Sam leave the Shire.  I won't disagree with those of you who feel that way.Something to consider, the meeting at the house of Elrond is some hour and 25 minutes into The Fellowship of the Ring.  When Frodo and Sam leave the Shire, is some 35 minutes into the film.  And yet, Peter Jackson was to wrap up a 9+ hour movie in five or ten minutes.  It doesn't make any sense to me.  How can you wrap up a 9+ hour movie with just a thought, or an afterthought.  For most of the trilogy, the one thought was to destroy the ring.  In the end, you not only see the ring destroyed, you see the hobbits back home, with life moving on, except for Frodo.  You get to see peace again in Middle Earth.  It needed to be that long to end it properly.  That is my thought on the ending.No matter what, give this extended cut a try.  You may like it, you may hate it, but judge it for yourself, and keep an open mind.	5.0	The Final Battle For Middle Earth	2004-10-04	66	36	30

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1HC40DCVK88U1	"Seany Boy ""HGL (Happy-go-lucky)"""	This movie is amazing.  I'll go ahead and say right now that I have never read any of the Lord of the Rings books, so I am kind of an outsider, but the movies were wonderful.  They progresively got better... at times in the first one I got bored, but the second was way better, and now the Return of the King? AMAZING.  I only give it 4 stars because it was hard to follow at times, I expect it would have been easier to understand had I read the books.  Overall, one of the best movies I have ever seen.	4.0	A Stunning Movie	2004-12-29	1	0	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2RDR5G65D9H84	Sebastian Fernandez	This is a very good movie, one that reflects Tolkien's book with great accuracy, but I cannot help compare it with the other two episodes and come to the conclusion that &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot; were better productions. I think that the Oscar won for Best Picture was an award given more based on the merits of the whole production than on those of just the movie itself. Even though I have the extended DVDs for the first two movies in the series, and enjoyed the long versions, in the case of &quot;The Return of the King&quot; I found even the regular version to be overextended at some points. This happened to me mostly in the parts dealing with Frodo's and Sam's journey to Mordor.The movie starts presenting the story of how Smeagol came across the ring and lost his mind becoming Gollum. He then lost the ring when Bilbo stole it from him. This story is briefly described in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but for those of you who want to know the details, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is your book. Now Gollum is guiding Frodo and Sam to Mordor and is having an internal fight with his Gollum personality, trying to decide whether to help the hobbits or misguide them and try to steal the ring from them.The rest of the group is in Isengard, where Sarunam has been beaten and has remained trapped in his tower. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the rest of the fellowship are celebrating but worried about the lack of news from Frodo. But they also have to face a pressing issue, Sauron is moving his army to destroy Minas Tirith, and their only hope is to get the King to summon the different races of Gondor and defend the main city in that area.Except for the criticism mentioned above, I enjoyed the movie a lot. The magnitude of this production is breathtaking, and every little detail is considered and taken care of. The whole crew does an amazing job in terms of acting. I have enjoyed the performances of Elijah Wood for quite some time now, and he did not disappoint me in this case either. I also have to give excellent marks on the depiction of two of my favorite characters in the story, Legolas and Gimli, which are shown and act just as I imagined them.	4.0	&quot;Become what you were born to be&quot;	2004-07-03	1	1	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3EFSLEMHNPP6A	Senor Zoidbergo	I'd have to agree with someone else that said that this extended cut of ROTK is not as good as those of TTT and FOTR.  We get a few nice scenes here and there, but I feel as if in general, they don't add much.(not in any particular order...)1)  Beginning scene with Saruman- good addition, but unfortunately marred by the very fake looking fireball.2)  I liked the extra scene of Gothmog's death- he was a bit too important of a character to have dismissed his death so lightly.3) Eomer's bawling scene with Eowyn- fantastic!4) A few more shots of Gamling, but I don't think we ever find out how he dies? if he even does.5) The much hyped House of Healing is too hyped; there's not enough of an interaction between Faramir and Eowyn to justify their strong love for each other in my opinion.6) The secret hidden cameo of Peter Jackson as a pirate getting killed by Legolas' errant arrow is farkin' hilarious.  Abosolutely a hoot!7) Aragorn's killing of the Mouth of Sauron did seem a bit strange- uh, weren't they discussing under a truce flag?  Just a bit of movie trivia here, but the Mouth was played by Bruce Hopkins, the same actor who played the Trainman in the Matrix:Revolutions.  Interesting, both characters had bad teeth...8) Was the witch king really more powerful than Gandalf the WHITE?9) Enjoyed the additional combat footage; e.g. the orcs initially faily to break through the gates of Minas Tirith, and needing to bring up Grond.  Also liked the sweeping wide shots of the siege towers attacking the walls.  And, the orcs' attacking Osgiliath is clarified a bit more as well.In conclusion, it was a decent cut, but not the best.  But, with all the extras, this is a very worthy set!	5.0	Great set, but extended cuts not perfect	2004-12-18	10	6	4
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A30X7VQZILMFZT	Sertorius	I should start here by saying that I have read the Lord of the Rings many times and am deeply immersed in its lore.  Peter Jackson's movies are far from perfect adaptations of the books, but they gain a lot of points for the respect and passion for the source material that is present in every frame.  Peter, Phillipa, Fran and their disciples took this franchise very seriously and it shows.  That being said I will proceed with your regularly scheduled review. I feel that there are really 3 different reviews to be made here; first of the movie itself, second of the extended footage in the Platinum edition and last of the many documentaries present in the appendices.The Return of the King is both the most spectacular and most flawed film of the trilogy.  The documentaries reveal that the final days of the production and scoring were more than a little rushed as the movie hurtled towards completion.  Perhaps for this reason the balance sometimes seems off, and huge action set pieces often dominate important turning points.  &lt;SPOILER> This was particularly evident in the Battle of Pellenor Fields, where Eowyn and Merry's confrontation with the Lord of the Nazgul was largely upstaged by Army of the Dead (who only battled the corsairs in the books) and by Legolas' acrobatics with Mamukin (barely mentioned in an aside in the books).  This annoyed me, but overall did not diminish my love for the movie and what it did accomplish&lt;End SPOILER>.  There was also a conscious decision by the filmmaker to exaggerate some the character traits of some characters to make explicit what Tolkien left implicit.  Denethor was the major victim of this, his madness and despair overwhelming the strength and intelligence.  Frodo and Aragorn are also somewhat less strong and decisive than they could have been, but this does serve to place them on a more human and approachable scale.  But overall the film is far greater than the some of its flaws; it is sumptuously beautiful, vastly exciting and finally emotionally evocative.  Particular note should also be made of Bernard Hill's spectacular performance as Theoden.The extended features are a bit of mixed bag.  The scenes at the beginning with Saruman are absolutely essential and powerful (and frankly I don't understand why they were left out of the theatrical release).  The extra time spent with Frodo and Sam in Mordor was also pretty well spent.  Other sequences, like a drinking match between Legolas and Gimli, and some silly Gimli moments on the Path's of the Dead seem strangely out of place and disturb the flow of the movie.  There are also some extra scenes for the battle of Pellenor Fields, some of which was good, but the overall effect once again moved the emphasis of the battle away from Rohan to Aragorn, Gimli and particularly Legolas.  In the final analysis the extended version is pretty much a wash and not notably better or worse than the theatrical cut.The documentaries present in the appendices are generally fabulous, if you have the time and patience to make your way through them.  I was also surprisingly moved by the short films by a young New Zealand film-maker than were included as part of Fran Walsh's inspiration for writing the song Into the West.  More than anything the documentaries reveal what an epic, labor of love this whole project was and how engaged everyone involved became by the end.  They made me love and appreciate the film all the more, rather than taking away its magic.	5.0	Respect for Source Material	2005-01-27	6	4	2

It introduces Denthor the stuard of Gondor, well if you've seen the extended version of the Two Towers that actually introduces him. Also the ghost men that come to mens aid in the war.Merry wishes to fight in war, but the men of Rohan don't want him as a burden to carry through war. Elrond gives Aragorn the blade that was once broke, but is now restored and tells him that the only way to win the war is with the help of ghost men that hide in the mountains. Only the king of Gondor can control them, in Return of the King Aragorn finally accepts his fate as the King of Men He along with Legolas, and Gimli go into the mountains and the cave that hold the dead army. This scene has the best special effects out of the whole movie.Gollum tries and successfully comes between Sam and Frodo. Gollum leads Frodo and Sam up the secret stairs and tricks Frodo into believing Sam at the last of their food supplize, Frodo bids Sam to leave and he does. Gollum continues to lead Frodo up the stairs and they reach a dark tunnel filled with spiderwebs. Frodo realizes that Gollum has tricked him, but not soon enough. A giant spider attacks Frodo, he remembers that he has a special light that was given to him by Lady Galadriel. He uses it against the spider, and it seems to work.. The spider goes and hides and Frodo stays to regain strength, but he lengered to long in the spiders layer. The spider stabs Frodo and paralyizes him, then covers him in its web.Sam ignores Frodo's request and comes back to Frodo's aid at his time of need.  He scares off orc's and attacks the spider until it leaves. Frodo fears that the orc's have taken the ring but come to realizes that Sam took it while he was paralyized. Sam gave Frodo the ring back and they continued to the fires Mordor. They dress up as orc's and get to the outer rim of the tower of Mordor. Something outside gets the orc's attention along as the great eye's attention, it's a distraction created by Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, Gimli, Merry, Pippin, and a living army of men. They go to fight the orc's and give Sam and Frodo the chance to destroy the one ring.Frodo is to week to continue, Sam realizes he can't carry the ring, but he picks up Frodo and starts to carry him. They are attacked by Gullom who is still trying to take the rin from Frodo. While Sam and Gollum continue to fight Frodo finds the currage to take the ring to fires of Mordor. The men recieve help from large eagles, who fight the nazgul in mid air while men attack the orc's on land. Sam meets Frodo in the mountain and bids Frodo to distroy the ring. The Ring seems to have to much control over Frodo and he keeps it. Frodo puts the ring on and starts to leave the mountain, but is attacked by Gollum. They fight, and Gollum bites the finger that has the Ring off Frodo but its not over, Frodo pushes Gollum with the ring into the fires of Mordor. Gollum and the Ring and everything evil are finally destroyed.The tower of Mordor falls and fire spreeds and burns. Sam hurr's Frodo out of the mountain and onto a high rock excaping the lava or ""fire"".  Once the ring is distroyed Frodo starts to remember his life in the Shire. Sam remembers his crush on Rosie, and says he wanted to marry her.  Frodo and Sam fear it's the end for them, only to see  Gandalf come to their aid with a giant egal. The Egal picks Frodo and Sam up with their feet and fly them to safer grounds. Frodow then wakes back in Rivendell with the sun on his face and the sound of calming birds near by. He realizes he's still alive and see's Gandalf for the first time since he fell in the Misty Mountains. He then is happily reunited with Merry Pippin, Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn, and Sam.Next you're taken back to the white city of Gondor. To the crowing of Lord Aragorn, the king of all men. He is crowned by Gandalf the white in front of the city of Gondor. Aragorn sings a song in elvish, and walks up to meet Legolas and group evles. He sees Arwen and Elrond. Arwen walks up to him and he gives her a kiss. Together Lord Aragorn and Lady Arwen walk up to the hobbits who bow to them. Aragorn tells the hobbits that they boy to no one and the city of Gondor all bows to the hobbits.Frodo ends Bilbo's story of their and Back again that was started in the Fellowship of the Ring. The hobbits finally return to the shire. They try to pick up their normal lives again but find it difficult. Sam finally gets the courage to ask Rosie to marry him. They show the wedding of Rosie and Sam. Frodo can't settle back into his own life and realizes he must leave the Shire again. They take Bilbo head to the harbor to the last ship to leave middle earth. No one expects that Frodo is going to leave with them until he takes his place besides the elves. He asks Sam to completely finish the story. The end by showing Sam returning home to Rosie and his kids.This maybe a long movie, yes but if you've seen the other two movies it's well worth the time! I give it an A along with the other two versions of the Lord of the Rings. I hope sometime soon I can see the extended version of Return of the King."	5.0	An ending you can't miss	2005-03-05	3	2	1

That being said, how does Peter Jackson decide to leave out the scene where the hobbits return to the shire and have to defeat Sauraman and Wormtail.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	"I confess I don't much care about the mini-moves and the sub-themes in all the three installments (thanks in no small measure to the year long gaps in between) but this LOTR finale is a delightfully sweeping, emotionally charged, visually spectacular conclusion that transports you to another world and grips every last fiber of your being.The things that have worked for the first two sets work as fantastically as ever. The bad guys are flying around on these fearsome, shrieking dragons now, and I shuddered each time one flew across the screen (note: sound is perfect.) Frodo and Sam face an enormous spider that is one of the most convincing special effects in recent memory, made all the more terrifying by director Peter Jackson's heralded sense of horror-film timing. (Just when you think it's safe....)And then there's the battle of Gondor itself, so colossal it makes the battle for Helm's Deep look like a drive-by shooting. You wondered how they'd keep it from looking like a repeat of the Helm's Deep battle when it's almost the exact same situation? Well, every bit of it is bigger, grander, more exciting, than before. The trilogy never feels more magnificent than it does in these sequences.Put simply: ""Return of the King"" is majestic beyond all measures. Technically, and for its visual effects alone, I'd be willing to wager it will sweep any and all Oscars available in the category.And yet, the single most brilliant tenet of the trilogy has been, and continues to be, its ability to deliver such magnificent visuals without forsaking the humanity of the work. I can think of many films (including some trilogies) that dazzle me with spectacle but never make me feel anything for the characters themselves -- The Matrix for instance which got all tangled up in its own self-important yet doozy theme. The ""Lord of the Rings"" set has managed both, and continues to do so here.When it all ends, and the many stories are wrapped up in a succession of final scenes, it's awesome to contemplate how much life has been infused in these action-oriented tales.Stuff that legends are made of. I highly recommend watching the movie, and grabbing the DVD when it is out."	5.0	A SPECTACULAR CINEMATIC FEAT, AND NOT JUST OF CGI	2003-12-27	4	3	1

In the fellowship of the ring, we got the set up of fellowship and fighting in the forest. it is good beginning showing the introduction to the whole story with great entertainment. For two towers, we saw a great battle to defense the castle. These are peaks in the films. But what we have in three? a more big castle and more oracle and men fighted and died. It is REPEATING the two towers but turn out to be worse than the fight in two tower, of which the whole story of chapter two is to prepare for that fight, What else we have? Sam and Frodo climbling the mountain and revealing human nature? What a old and dull screen we have! the technique is bad to show that ""Nature"".I come with great expectation to see the film but go home with great disappointment.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2OWVFVEE33S04	silenceofthestorm	"Before I go into more details let me first say this:if you are a Tolkien purist and you didn't like the theatrical edition of The return of the king and you hope this extended edition will ""fix"" it, you'll be quite disappointed. Alltough this movie re-inserts many scenes cut from the book, gives us more depht and insight to character motivation and has a more even pacing, it doesn't ""fix"" anything but rather expands on what was allready there.However, if you, like me, loved the original edition, you'll certainly love this version even more (and yes, I've read the book).Most of the new scenes aren't vital, but still add more depht and background into the story. The pacing is slowed down a bit, so the viewer has actually some time to breathe between all the intense epic battles.I'll mention the things I found worth noting below (skip it if you don't like spoilers or long reads).The voice of Saruman - yes it's back. In the original movie Isengard is dealt with in only a few minutes. Now there's a quite long confrontation with the now defeated Saruman. It's a great scene that both gives resolution to an important character, explains how the palantir got in the water and foreshadows what's to come in the next 4 hours. I'm glad Jackson didn't go for another wizard fight (save for one fireball) but focusses on the dialogue instead - indeed lots of Tolkiens original dialogue made the cut. Even the way Saruman dies is quite true to the book, alltough it happens at Isengard instead of the Shire now. Great addition.The next part of the movie is a bit of silence before the storm and feels like a transition between The two towers and Return of the king, both tying up the loose ends of TTT and foreshadowing what's going to happen in the last chapter.Gandalf arrival at Minas Tirith is where The Return of the king really starts (of course all 3 parts are basically 1 very long movie, but still). And from there, the movie is pure gold.All the extra Minas Tirth footage sure is welcome. It gives us more background about the city and the characters Faramir and Denethor get some more attention. While Denethor still is torn by despair and grief from the start (we never see his noble side - no pun intended) we get more insight into his motives. Same goes for Faramir - there's a great scene between him and Pippin, which makes his suicide charge even more moving. The battle for Minas Tirith has only a few extra footage, but still remains one of the most spectactular battles ever seen on screen.Something that really improved is the whole ""paths of the dead"" section. There's more build-up, and it's made very clear that the dead aren't very reliable allies that will do everything Aragorn wants them to do. He should be glad that they finally decided to help him out in the first place (so that's why the army of death can't be used at the black gates!). It ends perfectly with the king of the dead saying ""we fight!""(what should have been left out tough is the scene where the corsairs get whiped out, it's a useless scene and only spoils the surprise later on).Another major improvement is the part between Pellenor and the final climax at the black gate/mount doom. Thanks to a few small scenes, the ""victory"" at Pellenor feels a lot more bittersweet now. Pippin looking for Merry at the battlefield between all the corpses and destruction is expanded and really moving now. The houses of healing is a much needed breather between all the intense fighting.The journey trough Mordor of Frodo and Sam is also improved and expanded. There's a nice scene where they are mistaken for orcs and have to march with them towards the black gates (and finally escape after a while).The Mouth of Sauron is also back in (quite creepy scene). This all provides more and better build-up to the final climax, which remains utterly breathtaking.To sum it up: the extended edition of The Return of the king improves on an allready awesome film so I highly recommend it. If you didn't like the original version tough, this film likely won't change your mind."	5.0	Amazing final chapter	2005-02-21	9	9	0

The movie itself is amazing and the special features are surprisingly very comprehensive.  Most special features on other DVDs involve nothing but actors saying how ""great the film is"" or how the director is ""such a passionate genius.""  None of that BS is found here, you actually learn about the making of the film.First off, the movie.  I was blown away when I saw the first edition in theaters, it was trully awesome.  I was a bit hesitant to purchase the Extended Editions of the three films becuase I thought they were long enough already.  Boy was I wrong.  All of them add so much to the story and the characters, it's well worth a purchase even if you have the original versions.  Don't assume that all the scenes added are boring ones, however.  Major action scenes are added (especially for ROTK) and bits and peices are added to the current scenes.  At four hours, the EE of ROTK actually goes by faster than the original because of all the action that was added.  The battle of Minas Tirith (best battle scene ever by far...like holy crap, man) is made better by many added special effects shots.  The best new scene is one in which Gandalf and his band of traveling minstrels (haha) face off against Sauron in the very beggining.  I watched this thinking, why the feck did PJ cut this?  The moral of the story is, get the Extended Editions, for they are far superior.Now, on to the special features.......Amazing!  They cover everything.  It is quite long, however, so it may take you three to five days to watch depending on your level of geekiness.  My favorite of all the featurettes is the visual effects.  I just find that stuff so interesting.  It talks about the battles, the creatures, the landscapes, and the shear scope of what weta had to do for this film.  I watched the movie, watched the special features, and then watched the movie again with my newfound knowledge of how they made it.  That's how good the special features are, they're inspirational.In conclusion, this is a must have if you liked the original Return of the King.  This is better.  If you like this one, then I recommend getting the Extended Editions of the other two as well."	5.0	Best DVD Ever!	2005-11-14	8	6	2
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A33OHGCE0V9MFU	Sizzlingtree	This movie, in my personal opinion, was the best of the trilogy. The culmination of events, that had been set rolling in the first film, was amazing. The battle scenes and the special effects were great to say the least and even that is an enormous understatement. What was best about this movie was the almost overpowering emotions that came across such as courage, sacrifice and friendship. No one who watches this movie will come away untouched by it. Especially if you are a Tolkien fan then you know what I mean. Like I said in my reviews for the first two extended edition versions of the Lord of the Rings, if you loved watching the movie on screen and are planning to buy it then you may as well invest a few bucks more and buy this extended version. You wont regret it. You WILL regret it if you go ahead and buy the theatrical version because it will just not have the same richness of script and character that this extended version contains. Everything is just better in the extended versions, right down to the interviews given by various members of the cast.	5.0	The King of them all	2004-11-13	7	5	2

Meehan	I have been a LOTR fan for over twenty years, and I absolutely love these movies, and of the three my favourite is ROTK.I was always looking forward to this one the most because it has my favourite scenes in it... 'The Choices of Master Samwise', 'The Grey Havens', the Mount Doom scenes, (I guess I should just say all the Frodo and Sam scenes) all of which were done superbly, although I have to admit that I was hoping for more of the 'The Choices of Master Samwise' in the EE, I know there is a little more but still, this in no way takes away from how truly superb this movie is.I just love every single little bit of it, especially the Frodo and Sam parts, which were done exceedingly well. Can I just say that I think Sean Astin and Elijah Wood are amazing, their performances are truly outstanding. Elijah is Frodo, I just can't see Elijah in there at all, he does it so well, that I just can't distinguish between his Frodo and the one in the Book, which for me is phenomenal as Frodo has been my favourite character (bar none) for all of those twenty years.Anyway, all  I can say is having waited for this movie for so long I was in no way disappointed, this movie (FOTR, TTT and ROTK) will always be my favourite movie, I love it so much, I can't even begin to tell you how much.	5.0	ROTK is the best movie of all time...	2005-02-17	0	0	0

What I really enjoyed about this movie is the movie was more than an adventure film.  The story had romance, dealing with friendships, loyalty, and most of all courage.  The courage to see something through to the very end. To fight for what you believed in.  You can't exclude unity.  To see all the different characters unite for one purpose was just wonderful.  I had to rewind during the battles in the film because they were just so jaw dropping.  I loved every single one of them.  The third installment of LOTR is an edge of your seat white knuckled action fest that will leave you screaming and clapping.Aragorn becomes the King he was meant to be and those battle scenes!!  Oh wow!!!  Flying dragons, ghosts, catapults and these humungous mammoths, I can't say anything but oh wow!!!  Good and evil have one last show down and the show down is awesome.To truly understand what all the fuss is about you have to watch this movie and then you will understand.  So many times movies are over hyped and when you finally get to see for yourself you are left wanting more.  Then only thing you will want to do after seeing this third installment is watching it again, and again, and again.  The ending left me in tears; it was such a touching scene.This movie deserved each and every Oscar it received.  It will be a long time before we see a movie trilogy such as this cause such fervor as the LOTR trilogy did.	5.0	The Best in the Trilogy!!!	2005-02-03	1	0	1

The vocabulary of praise has been exhausted; and I see no need to wax platitudinous.  It is simply impossible to capture the feeling this amazing 16 hour movie generates in the heart and the soul.  I'm not even going to try.One cannot imagine but that the late Professor Tolkein and his  late (?) son and archivist, Christopher, would have cheered this work of not one but MANY lifetimes.Tolkein produced a richly textured mythopoeic millieu that should be real; that is, in fact, more detailed than the history of many nations' national mythologies.  Who does not long for a world where evil CAN be driven from the Earth?Jackson, et al, so nailed the entire book (and it's as one movie as it is one book) that he achieved a miracle our dim praise can add nothing to other than competitive effusiveness.The wonder speaks for itself.  We all have that sinking feeling in our guts that the self-proclaimed Academy is going to ""Annie Hall"" LotR as it did to ""Star Wars"" all those years ago.  At least we can thank the stars Woody Allen doesn't have a movie in contention!  Back to the sinking feeling: we all know the ""Academy"" is going to administer the proverbial boot to Messers/Mesdames Jackson, Walsh, Mortensen, Astin, Woods, Rhys-Davies, Ian McKellen, et al.  The failure to nominate Astin as Best Supporting Actor was obscene enough.  I dearly, dearly hope I'm wrong.  If a marginal, ephemeral movie like ""Titanic"" can sweep, then the greatest movie of the generation, by any measure of justice, can and must do the same.Should things go the way they look to, long after this year's Oscar Lights have faded away, and even amazing films like ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Master and Commander"" are forgotten in the bargain bins at Wal-Mart, long after our children have left this Earth to our grandchildren, one ineluctable truth will remain:These movies have few equals and no superiors.Rather like Prof. Tolkein himself.Bravissimo!"	5.0	What more can be said...	2004-02-15	4	3	1

And I find that it was just exciting to watch, and 'cherish' the LOTR dvd at home, even though I've watched ROTK in theater for 5 times. (In fact, to many LOTR fans, no matter when we watch those LOTR movies again and again, the movies come as just new ones. Like, you haven't seen those before)Now it's time to have the final conlcusion of the great trilogy, thanks to the extended dvd edition. Moreover, from this collector's gift set, you'll be fully satisfied with meeting Minas Tirith (although it's miniature size) and bonus DVD of the LOTR symphony.

Even less happens in this. Frodo and Sam do the last wee bit of their trip to Mount Doom where they have a fight with Gollum.  All the other surviving characters go off and have a massive great big battle. The good guys win. Everybody goes home. Ho hum.Much as with the other two, the New Zealand mountain landscape is awesome, especially in a breathtaking scene where the watchfires of Gondor get lit. The battle scenes are pretty cool in places (though after all the monster siege engines giant elephants those dead guys were a damp squib and a desperate anticlimax). Some of the sfx monsters are fun, like the big flying monsters the Nazgul ride and the spider Shelob. But come on folks, let's all grow up. This is, mostways, a tedious, outrageously self-important film vastly hyped and with a monster budget but basically very silly and far too long. Everyone in the world seems determined to see it but, having done so, you would have to be either a serious masochist or a hopeless Tolkien nerd to ever want to sit through it again. Face it, nobody who thinks this is great cinema would know great cinema if it ran them over. At best, in places, it is great spectacle but that is something very different, something whose optimal duration is rather closer to 20 than 200 minutes."	3.0	Oh Please...	2004-01-23	52	7	45

Mr. Sypolt from Pennsylvania, I believe, is sorely mistaken in regards to the spelling of Saruman and his ultimate fate. The movie and book made no mention of him being turned into an orc. In fact, it didn't mention any specifics as to his whereabouts after his escape(sorry for spoiling part of the book) until the end of the third book-not mentioned in the movie-in which case he was still definitely not an orc. Please do not inform people on subjects which you yourself are not so well informed. Try going to the book section on this site for the three-in-one Lord of the Rings trilogy for a very reasonable price.The third installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is, In my opinion the best for any action fan like myself. While some are entirely correct in saying that the plot of the movie and book are only loosely connected, and the movie fails to reproduce the same feeling the book offered, I believe it is the best possible rendition of this story that can still satisfy such a large audience.Every actor, even the local New Zealander playing Eomer, delivered a top notch performance. So much so, that I could not find anything in the acting that took away from the overall milieu the film offered.If you want to watch this movie I suggest first clearing your schedule for 3 and a half hours or so, unplug the phone, shut the blinds, and get a nice bowl of caramel popcorn(all optional, naturally) and immerse yourself in this incredible cinematic work of art.	5.0	Highly Recommended	2004-08-21	2	2	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3A13UL0TB2Z6V	"Spiders ""Eeeeeeeeeeeek!"""	I have read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and its prequel, The Hobbit, many times.  After watching the Return of the King in the theaters and now on the DVD Platinum version, I am sick to heart that such a moving, dramatic, and inspiring story has been reduced to such trash.  Of course there is no way to faithfully compress the complexity of a deeply thought-out book such as this into a movie, and it is not this failure which leads me to complain.  What saddens me is that the details of the story that could have made great cinema have been altered or cut out, and that the movie resorts to the worst sort of cheap thrills churned out by Hollywood, to take their place.Let me begin near the ending, with the destruction of the Ring, and the downfall of Sauron.  The entire storyline of a massive trilogy has built up to this point.  Surely, the simple fact of the Ring's destruction would be sufficiently dramatic to deeply move viewers.  It is the culmination of Frodo and Sam's heroic struggle, the passing of darkness from Middle Earth, the destination toward which all the many sub-plots of the story have been bent.  However, in director Peter Jackson's hands, such a perfect dramatic climax is not given the focus it deserves.  Instead, the ultimate moment is drawn-out and cluttered.  Gollum and the invisible Frodo struggle at the edge of the precipice above the river of lava for far too long.  Frodo falls over the edge, and must be rescued by Sam.  As the mountain explodes, Frodo and Sam escape, mere steps ahead of rivers of lava.  The entire land of Mordor is suddenly ripped open by earthquakes which engulf all the bad guys, but leave the army led by Aragorn miraculously unscathed.  By the time all this hubbub is over, the real drama of the moment has been lost.It would have been excitement enough for me, had the movie simply shown Gollum charging at Frodo, quickly biting off his finger, and falling into the crevasse by the force of his own momentum.  Why did Jackson distract us from reveling in this victory?  Frodo and Sam need not overcome more obstacles at this point, to prove to us their worthiness.  Why throw Frodo over the cliff?  Why have them run from rivers of lava?  These scenes are meaningless--merely opportunities to make the audience gasp once more, and  for the special effects lab to show off its chops.Well, I have vented enough for now.  Obviously, there are many more points to address, but this review is too long already.  I am deeply disappointed, not only that this beloved story has been mistreated, but also that so many Tolkien fans appear to be unable to distinguish between true drama and shallow melodrama, between real plot development and the instant gratification of impressive special effects.  I hope that someone out there who agrees with me posts a similar review here, because I am feeling alone amidst all this mindless adoration of a truly awful piece of work.	1.0	When did excessive special effects and poorly acted melodrama become the new standard for great fantasy?	2006-12-08	62	17	45
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2LICSQ2IFE3C5	"SPM ""scott_maykrantz"""	Since Jaws, some of the best movies ever made have combined spectacular special effects with heartfelt, personal moments. The closer these two elements come together, the better the film is. In Return of the King, you can see actors and special effects blend perfectly. Take, for example, Eowyn fighting the Witch-King of Angmar. She looks terrified but defiant, shaken one moment and able to deliver a killing blow in the next. But it's all faked --- she was attacking open air when her parts were filmed. The slithery Fell Beast and Witch-King were added digitally. We all know it's faked, but the moment is absolutely convincing.The rest of the movie has the same feel. Are the landscapes real,  or digital? It doesn't matter. The actors draw you in and make it all seem real --- and the special effects artists have given every weapon, battlement, and creature a historical authenticity.The best parts of the movie are saved for the end. The One Ring has to be destroyed in a way that is epic but intimate. Frodo's struggle leads to a surprise twist, and Gollum becomes far more important to the fate of Middle Earth than anyone imagined. The epilogue scenes are beautifully-filmed, drawing the whole saga to a close perfectly. If you missed this movie at the theater, you should check out the DVD. It's worth watching over and over to catch every detail..	5.0	Five stars	2004-05-28	1	1	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A29BQ6B90Y1R5F	S. Rhodes	"Never have I seen such a stunning trilogy that concludes so flawlessly and keeps you watching at every moment!  This isn't one of those ""There the trilogy is done"" where the thrid one is considerably more disappointing than the other two, but where the thrid film is the BEST of all of them.From the moment ""Return of the King"" opens up with its narration you'll be hooked from every word spoken to every battle scene that takes place and ultimately to the ending itself.The characters shine brightly in this final installment and the acting is flawless. Perhap its because the actors have grown to become more than just an actor or actress in their role but instead they've become the character themselves.  This makes for flawless acting and a more enjoyable movie.This movie certainly didn't need a whole lot of special effects to make it good (nor did it need any hype to get people to see it) but the special effects are brilliant.  Everytime I see Gollum I'm still impressed with how they were able to create him!What also stands out in Return of the King is how the story has gone from being Frodo's (Elijah Wood) to being Sam's (Sean Astin).  Sam is definitely a heroic figure in this movie and not for a moment will you be disappointed by Sean Astin's performance.Never have I come to love a storyline like this and never have I come to be so attached to these characters.  Sean Astin certainly deserves credit for his role as Sam and Viggo Mortenson also deserves a lot of credit for being Aragon.Never has a trilogy come to such an epic and satisfying conclusion. Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is by far the best in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Hats off!

But after the death of his beloved son Boromir, which he blames Faramir for, the stewart of the White City has lost all hope of surviving the war against the armies of Sauron, and is now teetering on the brink of insanity. Out of pride, he refuses to call for help. Taking advantage of his smaller size to pass undetected, Pippin lights the beacons all the same, signalling the Rohirrim, led by King Th&eacute;oden, to start their march East. Among them are also Merry and &Eacute;owyn, eager to fight alongside her kin in the battle on which depends the fate of all mankind, and Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn, still in doubt about his destiny and heirloom as king of Gondor.Meanwhile, Gollum is leading Frodo and Sam further into the dark land of Mordor, up treacherous, vertiginous stairs and through tunnels filled with dangers, Frodo's mind slowly giving in to the power of the Ring he set off to destroy.I'm finding it very hard to concentrate on my job today, I keep staring at the void, my head filled to the brim with images of the film. What a blast! The actors, and the Hobbits in particular, are amazing, the sets, costumes and visual effects are stunning, the music is riveting! Want to know more?

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AGMW3I34INNYG	Stephen Cannon	The theatrical cut of ROTK is an excellent film in its own right (see my separate review).  But to adapt a work of such profound detail is inevitably difficult.  The extended versions are a nice touch, simply because those of us who really enjoyed the films but missed some of the cut moments can enjoy a more complete experience.  The controversial Saruman confrontation is here, although not necessarily done to the liking of the literary fans.  It serves the film, though.  We do see here the houses of the healing, as well as the beginnings of romance between Faramir and Eowyn.  What happens between the paths of the dead and Aragorn's attack at Pelennor Field is fleshed out as well.  The die-hard fans will certainly prefer this version, in spite of, or maybe even because of, its length.  My only complaint: in the appendix of the book, Tolkien gives a timeline of the Fellowship, showing what they did with the rest of their lives.  I would have liked to have seen that included as a narration.  But that minor inadequacy is not enough for me to penalize this excellent final product.

People talk about the multiple endings as affecting their enjoyment, but Jackson actually cut down the number of loose ends that had to be managed.  There could have been 2 or 3 more endings if he'd chosen to have them.Don't overthink this decision.  Go buy this film, and enjoy it, and pass it on."	5.0	Definitely worth buying	2005-01-23	3	1	2

Jackson ignored much of the deeper side of LOTR for action sequences; however, if he had stuck faithfully to the book, Jackson would never have reaped such profits.I liked ROTR for its stellar presentation, especially the dead army, but I disliked it for its Hollywood influence. Jackson strikes blows for woman's rights with Eowyn; puts characters in places they never should have been, doing things they never did; too much Christian Right influence in this picture: Godlike Gandalf talks about Heaven, overt contrasts between evil-black and good-white.ROTR reminded me of Return of the Jedi: It just overflowed too damn much with good feelings and good guy victories.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A23C2YC8C3SUCV	Steve	The movie was, for most folks, a fun watch.  I was too irate to enjoy it the first time I watched it in the theater.  I settled down a little the second time, but was still disappointed.  I had a small hope the extended edition would redeem it, but no luck. The main reason is that the major problems with Jackson's third movie were not subtractions (which even extreme purists like me can forgive, because you can't tell the whole story in 9 hours) but additions, which served no purpose and detracted from Tolkien's tone and purpose.The Fellowship of the Ring was a very good movie and a very good adaptation, all things considered.  The Two Towers departed in a number of more substantial ways, sacrificing story for foolish notions about what audiences will pay for (instead of realizing that a great story doesn't need to be embellished) and setting the stage for a major decline in the Return of the King.  The writing on this gets 2 stars, because I'm in a generous mood.The visual effects, in the theatrical and extended versions, were fantastic, but less so in Return of the King than in the previous two movies.  The Mumakil are not quite up to par, nor are the dead.  The antics of Legolas in particular are more farcical and less well-done than the in the previous movies (I thought riding a shield down the stairs at Helm's deep was excessive, but slinging around on a Mumak?--come on, it looked as realistic as the scenes from Disney's Tarzan swinging and sliding on vines). 4 Stars for the effects -- very good, but not up to par with the previous 2 movies.Some of the extended material seemed OK, but none was essential at all and none redeemed the butchering the story underwent at the hands of some apparently very poor writers. Often the extended scenes were butchered as well.  An example would be the Witch King shattering Gandalf's staff during their showdown -- entirely uncalled for, and ignoring Tolkien's portrayal of the White Wizard.  Some were only so-so, like the scene with Saruman -- not anywhere near as good as the corresponding scenes in the book, but not horrible.On the other hand, the charge of the Rohirrim at the Pelennor, and the wave of riders crashing into the Orcish lines, was worth the price of the set by itself - still not as powerful as the book, but really really good nonetheless -- good enough to give me goosebumps each time I see it.Whether you you have read the books or not, I would recommend seeing this, but if you enjoyed the books, you will almost certainly be disappointed with many aspects of this movie.	3.0	The low point of Peter Jackson's trilogy	2004-12-25	21	9	12

Totaly could have done without Liv Tyler's character. Aragon should have fallen for the  blonde who went into battle and took out the serpent.

I couldn't wait for the extended version to arrive on the 4 disk set. When this was finally released, however, I was disappointed - the ending feels far too long and drawn out now so that the excitement and suspense created by the Gondor battle is totally squandered by the story meandering off, not least to follow Frodo on an extended amble through Mordor. So, only 4 stars.That said, the main battle is absolutely staggering. I could just watch it again and again and again. Well... I have! This is the type of film that upsets you when it ends as you just want more and more.

I was very let down. I enjoyed the first two Lord Of The Rings films, although I didn't think they were amazing by any means, but still really good films. After having a discussion with some friends last night about film and one of them telling me that Return Of The King was the greatest movie he'd ever seen (in front of the first 2 Godfather films, Shawshank Redemption, and Schindler's List - 4 great films), I decided I would finally watch Return Of The King.I thought it was merely okay. There were numerous things I didn't like about it:: The multiple endings - it just kept GOING and GOING. After the climax you don't need a 30-minute resolution. That's overkill and something you learn in any scriptwriting class. My brother told me that they did that because the books follow the same structure. I don't think that iss any reason to put that lengthy of a resolution in the film. If you've read the books, you know what happens after that. If you haven't, then you probably don't care to watch that much aftermath. I thought it was boring and dumb.: Pippin and Merry, especially Pippin. Jesus, what an annoying person. And why in the hell is a male hobbit named Merry? Every time his name was mentioned I cringed on the inside.: I thought the dialogue was poor overall.: Sean Astin isn't a very good actor. I don't think he delivered his lines very well at all.: The ""well-placed"" / ""tension breaking"" humor. I didn't think it was well-placed, nor did I think it was humorous. In fact, I think a movie like this has no room for little one-liners. It's an adventure/action/fantasty film, not a dramatic comedy.There were some things I did like, though:: The battle scenes were very nice and pretty intense (but Ii thought some of the CG camera angle choices were poor).: The FX/CG were very well-done, but I think the CG was overused. I felt like I was watching a video game demo for about 50% of the film.Overall, I was disappointed. I can't say I would recommend this film based on the quality alone, but I would have to recommend it to pretty much anyone because the film is technically well-made, and it's one of those films that you kinda have to have an opinion on to be taken seriously in a film discussion. But, it is possibly the most overrated film I've ever seen."	3.0	am i missing something?	2005-07-11	11	2	9
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A259AWHZ0SK69Z	"Stuart C. Hancock ""stuhancock"""	"I haven't read all of the previous reviews, so I don't know if anyone has commented on this.  Jackson's error in making it appear as if the eagles could take out the Nazgul raises a critical problem: If I'm not mistaken, in the book's description of the battle before the Black Gates, even though the eagles came to attack the armies of Sauron, they didn't attack the Nazgul's winged ""steeds.""  Tolkien was careful to cover all of his bases concerning Sauron's defenses, and with good reason:  If it was possible to disable the Nazgul en masse, there would be nothing preventing Frodo from merely riding to Mt. Doom on the back of an eagle, depositing the ring into the Cracks of Doom, and being home by teatime.  The whole story would have been over in the space of one chapter, and there'd be nothing particularly dramatic about LOTR."	5.0	Those Problematic Eagles	2005-01-24	7	2	5

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3OMPSEVL59ZDK	"Sylo ""Sylo"""	"Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King left me in complete awe. As I saw events unfolding before my eyes it was just as I had imagined them when I had read the books just a year ago. I knew how things were going to unfold yet was still at the edge of my seat for the entire conclusion to this amazing piece of art Peter has created. It was so emotionally intense I breathed a sigh of relief right along with Frodo when the end of all things had come. The battles were so grand, they have to be seen to be believed.The film starts off a little shakey with an akward flashback to the days when Gollum was really a hobbit like creature named Smeagol. He's fishing with his friend Deagol and events quickly turn grim. I felt this was sort of rushed, smeagol had turned evil almost too quickly, this so called friendship was so easily changed. I know this is meant as a comparision for frodo and sam,but it appeared as though deagol meant nothing to smeagol in the first place. The continues the akward beginning of both two towers and return of the king, it feels as though Jackson didn't quite know how to start the last two films, but once these things are past, events really start unfolding.I am not one who is going to start  bashing other trilogies. Matrix and Star Wars are good in their own respects. This movie did have things those other trilogies were lacking. But than again Peter is adapating a book, while the others are creating brand new stories with no book to fall back on. There are moments in this movie that are perfect in every way. Many involving Sean Astin as samwise the brave. He lives up to his monicker and becomes the series true heroe. Truly earning an oscar nod, but the liklihood of those thick heads at the academy to recognize sean are slim to none. The acting wins over this effects in this movie because without these strong performances this movie would have been empty and lifeless. This movie shines with so much heart its overwhelming.The ending was beautiful. There are no multiple ending as many have suggested. The books went on for about a hundred more pages after the events at Mt. Doom so compared to the books this ending was much more straight to the point. The most important scene showing our heroes getting the credit they deserve, because in the end it was not aragon, gandalf, gimli, or legolas' victory. It was the victory of 4 small hobbits that saved middle earth from destruction.""My dear friends...you bow to no one.""A line I will cherish forever in my own mind. The smallest of us can be the greatest of heroes. Forget sad attempts at drama such as Cold Mountain, Mona Lisa Smile, or the last samurai. This is the only film that creates real drama without pan handling to the audience. It is the first of the three films that doesn't really need an extended edition to be a masterpiece. Although I do look forward to that edition of the movie. Thank You to everyone involved for this amazing film experience.""I will not say do not cry, for not all tears are an evil."""	5.0	The Return of Great Film Making	2003-12-22	10	9	1

One alternate ending found on the appendicies (which disk it was on fails my memory) is worth a look, even though it's shown in storyboard format.An added extra are the two ""easter eggs""; one hidden on each disk.

The only author to captivate me more or as much as Frank Herbert is that great modern creator of mythos, J.R.R. Tolkein.  When I want science fiction that reads almost like Shakespeare, I turn to Herbert's Dune series.  When I want the legends of noble Kings and elves, I turn to the great Tolkein.I am very picky about the art of the motion picture.  I am even more ridiculous in my standards in seeing a great work of literature adapted to the big screen.  I am usually completely let down by how often Hollywood displays its talent for butchering even the most straightforward of classics.I was surprised.  Not only is this a great film on its own, it makes up for the sludge that was Peter Jackson's &quot;Two Towers.&quot;  It is obvious in viewing this that Jackson stepped up the standards for his actors and for himself.  Unlike the modern Lucas films, Jackson seems to be able to learn from his mistakes.  Every slight mis-step found in the earlier Tolkein films is fixed here.  And it makes for grand viewing.Thank you Peter Jackson.  You have delivered the goods this time and I am appreciative.  Amongst the mire of modern film, you have turned out something with impressive scenery and a royal nobility.

Then all of sudden you would feel - yea, he deserves to be the king when the Steward dude is just degenerating into a nutcase....4) Ok, maybe there was no need to show the Scouring of the Shire...I guess most people are happy things kinda end once the ring disappears...but dude, stop trying to trick us with those multiple endings...(you think it's end...fade out...then another scene..then you think it's the end again...fade out... and the another scene!@@!Ok this may sound like I hated the movie...I didn't.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AALQF8508VLZG	T.D. Ferguson	This is a well-constructed film that does its best to hold true to the spirit of the novels.  Producing a film that follows the written word exactly would have been impossible.  Therefore, Peter Jackson et al. have succeeded in making the best film adaptation of the revered series that we will see in our lifetimes.The scenery is gorgeous and the acting is solid.  I have to give special kudos to Sean Astin (Samwise Gamgee).  He will not win any awards, but he truly brought Samwise to life.The film's only drawback is the long ending.  The goal was obviously to stick close to the book.  However, it seems that the editors would have done well to make an earlier end and leave some other important footage in the final theatrical release, e.g. at least some sighting of Saruman.However, the epic stands completed, and perhaps the most deservingly successful epic of our time.  Should any of Tolkien's other work be brought to the silver screen, I hope that it is as tasteful and worthwhile as these three films.Note that very few people found the negative reviews helpful, relative to the overwhelmingly positive response.  Note also that this phenomenon occurs irrespective of how many times the same person posted a negative review and irrespective of how many non-creative modifiers (e.g. &quot;festering&quot;) and masked obscenities  have been used.If you believe in sitting down and being entertained by the art of film, this movie is worth buying.  If you have read the book and have been too skeptical to get to the theater, this one is worth your time.  If only twelve-year-olds like this movie, then twelve-year-olds are a lot smarter than many &quot;viewers&quot; estimate.	4.0	It's difficult not to be blown away.	2004-07-09	3	3	0

The biggest distingulishment between the 2 mediums is, in simple words, the books are fun, the movies are boring. I will say it in another simple way, the books, amoung many other books in the same genre, it still stay both original and fun to read. The movies, however, compare to its type in movie market, way way way boring, to name a few in the market, ""Willow"", ""Robin Hood-Prince of theives"", ""Harry Potter"". I put most of the blame to this man who won the academy award, Mr. Peter Jackson. Dun get me wrong, the art department whom took the jobs for this movie done their job to make it unpossibly being better at this time around. But the core man who handle the main flow and the cut of the movie, is a main flaw under my witness. Jackson has just so little talent to be a director to handle this project, he has also no prevision of what this movie ""should"" turn out to be, I have no wonder some people would call this series of movie ""documentary style"", as beyond to be called a documentary of an epic novel, it has absolutly no style, the man is apparently randomly accepting whatever materials that come to his hands, a director without inspiration muscle got lost in teh big forrest of different possibilities and he simply just roll dice for it as his solution, I watched the ""making of"" discs, that's exactly what he looks like his doing there.  May be people who support the books simply want no more but a clone version of book to be seen on big theaters, but I plead that thought, I love the books yet I plead becasue as I myself a definite lovers of movie magic who have seen so many great movies in the past, this movie just deliver so little, its dullness draw my patience in theater that I have to sustain so hard to sit through the whole movie, but then it was successful, supported by blinded fans whom driven by a genius writer who existed before my time, and Jackson took the credit without practicing very talent of his own.Every great movie makers in the past who's works are targeting to young audience brought their uniqueness to has a form of their movie style, to name a few - Speilberg, James Cameron, Scott Brothers. I'm more than in full confidence if this movie is handle by Speilberg, it would 10 times more fun yet stay original than the current dull version, James Cameron would make it entertaining but a little over the top of being cool for this movie, Scott Brothers would make the war goes beyond any of us can imagine but then the movie will become more or less a purely man's sport game, which will be a little weird. There are also many directors' name that well worth to mention to handle the job rather Jackson, here's a list of few - Danny Boyle, Cameron Crowe, Hiyao Miyazaki.

George ""anne-with-an-e"""	"To start off, I would say that movies are beginning to be so, ah, ""epic"" that I actually need to go see them more than once to let them fall in place in my mind.  For Return of the King (ROTK), we saw it 2 nights in a row, and this definitely helped.  The first night I was so awed by seeing the book played out in front of my eyes and I was so overwhelmed by some things at the end, that I forgot a good portion of the movie.  The next night I was able to appreciate the finer details, the acting, the flow, the genius behind these films.But what do I actually feel about it?  Well, I was wondering if anyone anywhere would be brave enough to give this a negative review.  I haven't read a negative editorial review yet, which is pretty phenomenal.  I, myself, will not venture into the lands of criticism with this film either.  There is too much love, passion, care, wit, ability, etc. that has been poured into this film - into these 3 films - to ever think about criticizing the makers.That said, I was sad to see that there were some things that were cut down or missing.  For instance, Merry's role was much smaller.  You don't know whether Eowyn is ever discovered injured until much later.  Faramir's character makes a similar disappearance act.  Aragorn's coming into his own as king wasn't as dramatic as I hoped.  And, also, they cut out some meaningful moments that I missed - such as Sam's suddenly gaining perspective on the situation when he sees a star in a hole in the clouds.That noted, I found the development of Sam's character & the burden of Frodo's character to be perfect - even if they added some scenes to get it across.  I found Gondor to be breath-taking.  Gandalf & Pippen had great interaction as they showed the preparation of Gondor for battle.  The fighters of Rohan were all as noble as you expected them to be.Overall, the New Zealanders kicked butt as they wrapped up this tremendous series.  And, in an industry that is supposed to be so political, gutless, and pandering as the film industry is supposed to be, I was so glad to see that Jackson & his crew made it simply by showing the genius & the love that they have.

My main gripe lay with the acting, i thought the acting of nearly all the characters lacked Gravitas. Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, Eowyn, Theoden were all boring in the film yet interesting in the book. The only exceptions were Ian Mckellan as Gandalf, The guy who did Gollum, Christopher Lee as Saruman (perfectly cast - acting with his eyes), Hugo Weaving as Elrond and the guy who played The Steward of Gondor. Then there is the issue of Jacksons judgement. The friendly rivalry between Legolas and Gimli for example was just a side issue yet in film 2 it was blown up into a big issue, perhaps Jackson was trying to be too completist, and a little more selectivity would have been in order, it made those characters look thin and childish. Another huge gripe is the Hollywoodisation of the film, i know the huge battle scene is important but in this film it is given the central role even over Frodo's Quest (which is central in the book). The battle scene was boring, you can only see orc creatures with bad make-up being slaughtered like children by long haired men with swords a limited number of times before it becomes tedious. Hollywood figured...'lets give them huge cgi madness, it will look good in the trailer'. The central plot of the third film should have been Frodo's slow succumbing to the power of the ring, this would have required a much better actor than the guy who played Frodo here, it would have required a deep ability to portray madness and personality change.Tolkien's book extremely well written and atmospheric but it is far from perfect, it almost seemed as though he wrote it with Hollywood in mind given it's slightly saccharine ending. I felt little emotion watching this film yet great emotion reading the book, something has been lost in the translation....	3.0	I am not a fan, Peter	2005-01-25	11	4	7

I thought the extra scenes added to the film overall, just as the extra scenes in the first two did. More of Tolkien's book and lore is a good thing as far as I am concerned. The scene with Eowyn and Faramir was nice after seeing her despair about withering into old age alone. Fantastic film overall!	5.0	Love this movie!	2013-01-08	0	0	0

It greatly deserved its Oscar for best picture and most definately deserved ever penny it earned.  The acting, special effects, and story are all wonderful.  The best of all three films it will live forever in the annals of film history.  Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Liv Tyler Viggo Mortenson, and the rest of the cast shined like diamonds in this film unlike in the other two installments.

The special effects are superb; you really feel like your there in Middle Earth.  The storyline centers most around Strider who is the rightful king of Gondor.  Frodo is a lesser character in this one.I however will warn you that this extended film was orginally rated R.  The battle sequences are intense and you see many deaths both human and orc.  This version contains a scene of the mouth of Sauron, this scene may scare children.I would also like to add that you must see the first to films to understand and apprechiate this one.  For those of you who don't want to spend the time or money to catch up, you may want to leave this film alone.  One more note, the origional film was 3 1/2 hours long.  The extended version has over an hour of added footage.  4 1/2 hours is a long movie.But if you are a fan like me I'm sure you will enjoy every second of the film.	4.0	The Best Lord of the Rings movie to date	2004-12-01	32	9	23

Based on the novel by J. R. R. Tolkien.Script by Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens.

One Ring to find them. One Ring to bringthem all and, in the darkness, bind them.""Though his puppet Saruman has been defeated, the Dark Lord Sauronprepares to unleash his gigantic army, led by the Witch King of Angmar--- leader of the Nazghul upon the Kingdom of Gondor--the last bastionof freedom against the power of Mordor.  Hindering Gandalf in hisefforts to save Gondor is its Steward Denethor who, overcome withdespair, has gone suicidally insane. While Aragorn looks for aid from avery dangerous source, the Riders of Rohan race to Gondor's rescueknowing full well that they are likely riding to their deaths.Meanwhile the treacherous Gollum guides Frodo and Sam into Mordorobstensibly to aid them in their quest but, in reality, leading theminto the cave where SHE lurks.  After SHE had done her foul work,Gollum will take the Ring from the desicated corpses of the Hobbits.The final battle begins and the world will never be the same.The only flaw here is a flaw in Tolkien himself. He had only one greatbattle in him and he repeated it in THE HOBBIT and twice here. Namely agiant army of orces attack a stronghold whose defenders make a valiantlast stand until rescued both by men on horses and another supernaturalforce. Jackson really extends it here adding an amazing battle with themassive oliphants and there is the brilliant confrontation with thewitch king of Angmar so why quibble? Lee has a great death scene.Sauron is destroyed in a spectacular fashion. The film has beencriticized for having multiple endings but that is really just fatiguefrom sitting in a theater for four hours. On the small screen thefilm's slow ending is appropriate farewell to these characters andworld that the viewer has invested so much time with.  As watchingthese film, I was reminded of the extreme violence without gore of suchfilms from the early 30s as the MGM Tarzan films and RKOadventure/horror films--the later of which this film feels like adirect throwback to. This makes sense when one recalls when Tolkienlived and wrote.As the decades pass, this film will be recognized as the classic it isas so much from that decade will be forgotten. It is a type of epicfilm that used to be made in the fifties/sixties. Intelligent.Literate. Sentimental.  One of the great Sci Fic/fantasy series evermade---right up there with the STAR WARS and PLANET OF THE APES films.Recommended."	5.0	And so a Classic enters the Cinematic Pantheon........	2011-01-29	1	1	0

When they made the first film ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", I seemed to like it more than ""The Two Towers"".  Now, ""The return of the king"" is very inspiring to anyone who is a ""big action-fantasy movie fan"".  I liked how they made the movie 3 hours and 20 minutes because it was a long time to express everything in the movie.  I thought it was good enough to see four times!Also, when they spaced out all of the battle sequances and go to amazing camera angles that almost reminded me of ""The Matrix"" trilogy.  This was the best movie I have ever seen.  This film can also compare to another great film of 2003 ""The Matrix Revolutions"".When I watched the first 10 minutes, it was great and got right to the point in explaining what they missed in ""The Fellowship of the ring"" of the odd fantisised creature ""Gollum"".  As time went on there was many twists and turns.  Right after I saw ""Return of the King"" it made me want to read the books.  Then once I finished ""the return of the king"" book, I was the movie for the 4th time and understood the movie better and also that the book made the movie make more sence.9...)"	5.0	Best movie of 2003	2004-04-14	0	0	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2M597GCCE1N2S	"the one and only ""david"""	"I was a big fan of Lord of The Rings back when more than half of the fans today didn't really know about this 3 years ago. I bought the first and second DVD and couldn't wait to see the third and final movie. This truly is one of the greatest trilogies ever made, and believe me, if you like action and adventure, with romance and powerful performances mixed in, then you will like this.Where to begin? The movie is the longest one of the three, about 3 hours and 20 minutes, and even though I got a little restless the last half hour in the theatre, I really liked it.Viggo Mortenson is one of the best as Aragorn, the heir to the throne of the kingdom of men. He and Gandalf the white, lead their friends in a desperate fight against an army of 600,000 orks or more. While I enjoyed the action sequences as much as anyone else, it was the scenery that got my attention.I am truly amazed at how beautiful New Zealand is, and I loved the scene where the signal torches were lit to warn of the beginning of the war. It was great to the see the mountains and the fog mix together. I loved the idea of showing us the torches like that, very beautiful.Meanwhile the two Hobbits, Sam and Frodo, and their evil guide Gollum, are trying to find a new way into Mordor, the land where the evil lord Sauron lives in. I was pretty impressed by the City of the Dead, but when the shriek appeared as the king of the Ringwraiths flew into view, it was a little too loud for me in the audience. I also noticed some kids crying as the movie continued.As the two armies prepare to march into battle, Gandalf manages to show us again what he can do, despite the fact that his beard is about 6 feet long, yet he does manage to save several men as they try to escape flying dragon-like creatures.Also when the son of the former king of men, who wasn't technically the king, decides to show his father he can actually be as good as a son as the king doesn't think he is leads a suicide attack on ork controlled territory was a moving scene. One of the other hobbits sang a song as the men rode into battle. Very moving to see what the son would try to do to impress his father.Now as for the action scenes go, I think if you saw Troy, then you will know what the battle scenes were like, although these are 10 times better. Kind of like Braveheart at the beginning but again, much better. Aeowyn, the niece of the king of Rohan, another kingdom of men, tries to fight but is told she cant because she is a woman, but before you blow your top let me just say she also is the one who kills the big bad dude of the Ringwraiths with the great line, ""I am no man!"" [Hint: the bad guy said no man could kill him]Now for the ending, it was like it could end at several different places, as the screen went dark multiple times. Once when Frodo and Sam are on a a rock surrounded by lava, and again when all the members of the fellowship reunite.And lets not forget the great scene where everyone bows down to the hobbits at the end of the book. Remember, there were several hard times when the Hobbits managed to pull through and keep hope alive. A very moving scene and the hobbits deserved it in my opinion.The second disk doesn't have a lot of extras which is a real surprise. However it does have the great segment from the Director, Peter Jackson's point of view. I also liked how several of the settings or characters were given sort segments that explained in more detail what they were, even though some of them are only a few minutes long.It also has a National Geographic Special, which shows us the making of the lord of the rings as well. and it even comes with the making of the several series of the lord of the rings game for playstation and x box. I own one myself, its pretty fun to watch.Now even though the extras are okay, it is the stories themselves that will become classics. This is truly a great film and should be viewed by anyone who has read any of the books, although the movies dont follow the books exactly!"	5.0	This will be legendary one day......	2004-10-21	5	5	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AZ24AYI4XPH8G	Tim Fattig	The end of this film-- after all the fighting, the sacrifices of choice and hope and life itself-- is unspeakably sad, for two of literature's (and cinema's) greatest friends, Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee, are separated: the scene is meant to be a joyous one but it is hard not to share Sam's feelings, or his tears. It is, after all, not just the end of a magnificent friendship, but the end, finally, of the greatest motion-picture trilogy of all time.Although it is &quot;the end of all things,&quot; as Frodo calls the grim conclusion of his Ring-quest, Return of the King begins, oddly, and endearingly, with the beginning-- the violent seizure of the Ring of Power by Smeagol (Andy Serkis, who has also provided the voice of Gollum for the trilogy), a Stoor who is forced to flee into the Misty Mountains with the Ring-- and the blood of his cousin, Deagol, on his hands. He devolves before our eyes, with his &quot;precious,&quot; the Ring, his only remaining possession. It is a stark sequence that nicely sets the desolate tone for the film-- indeed, all the characters must wrestle with their idea of what is &quot;precious,&quot; and the journeys they will undertake to have it.Fathers grieve lost sons; lovers grieve the miles between them; kings mourn nations lost, and on the brink of destruction. This theme-- the loss of &quot;precious,&quot; whoever or whatever it may be-- underlines the entire saga, and gives a certain poignancy to the struggles of the Smeagol personality trapped in the murderous form of the creature called Gollum, whose treachery in pursuit of the Ring reaches chilling proportions in the closing minutes of the film. Truly this is Gollum's film; for all the awards the film rightly received, one was overlooked: Best Supporting Actor for Andy Serkis, who did more with his voice and 3-5 minutes of screen time, than many actors manage to accomplish in dozens of films, or entire careers.The doomed King of Rohan, Theoden (Bernard Hill, and excellent throughout), offers a rousing speech about the ending of an era and the imminence of death, and death stalks heavily through the film: it has been called the darkest chapter of the trilogy, and fairly so. The characters killed, maimed, or psychologically ruined by the events of the last hour of the film, are so many, that it is easier to count those not affected, on some level, by all that has gone before. This film more than makes up for the rather light, almost frivolous tone of Fellowship of the Ring.There are omissions, of course: Where is Saruman (Christopher Lee)? He is mentioned, briefly, but never seen. And where are Gimli and Legolas when the elves take their leave at the end of the story? And what of the role of Grima (Brad Dourif), who has a major part is resolving the &quot;Scouring of the Shire&quot;-- scenes never shown, or even alluded to, in the theatrical version of the film. I suspect at least some of these questions will be addressed with the extended-version DVD release later on this year. I hope so.The theatrical-release DVD contains a few making-of specials, a well-done mega-trailer covering the entire trilogy, but, sadly, none of the looked-for previews of the next film in the series: this is it....until, at least, Jackson announces the filming of The Hobbit.In the Academy Award-winning closing theme (sung beautifully by Annie Lennox), we are asked, &quot;Why do you weep?&quot; Because the long and wonderful journey has come to an end. But as it the bards of old wrote, in that plaintive old song sung by Bilbo Baggins for many years, &quot;The Road goes ever on and on&quot;-- and what a journey it has been.	5.0	There and Back Again-- What a Journey!	2004-05-28	1	1	0

The Return of the King wraps up the trilogy in a monumental extended edition that clocks in at over 4 hours!  This version includes 50 minutes of new and extended scenes.These new scenes really make it a completely different movie than the theatrical version, providing greater depth and detail to existing storylines, as well as wrapping up loose ends.  Among the scenes added back in are:1) the Final fate of Saruman and Grima Wormtongue.  Many were upset that this was left out of the theatrical version but it's worth the wait.2) The Witch-King confronts Gandalf...short but powerful scene3) Aragorn confronts Sauron through the Palantir...again a short but powerful scene.4) The Fellowship is confronted by the Mouth of Sauron before the Black Gate.  Great scene and while some disgree with Jackson diverting from the source material, I think it worked well.5) the budding romance between Faramir and Eeowyn.6) Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli encounter the Corsairs of Umbar and we see how they got aboard their ships.And there's much more such as extended scenes of orcs and Urak Hai's fighting amongst themselves in the tower of Cirith Ungol, more from the Battle of the Pellennor Fields, and more in the city of the Dead.Tolkien purists tend to get up in arms about changes but I think Jackson has done a great job in balancing things that needed to be changed for dramatic purposes but still staying faithful to the source material.No...there was no ""Scouring of the Shire"" but we did get a glimpse of this when Frodo peered into Galadriels mirror in ""Fellowship""  Even with each movie running 3 1/2 to 4 plus hours you simply could NOT included everything and certain things had to be streamlined.  Comparing it to Star Wars is utter nonsense as the Rings trilogy did a far better job of maintaining continuity and character development.Return of the King does justice to Faramir, in particular, who came off like a bit of a jerk in The Two Towers.  His interaction with his father Denethor was the most tragic part of the movie.Along with the extended edition you get FOUR different commentary tracks although I admit to have never listened to more than two.  You get a number of documetaries and featurettes with over 7 hours of material.Everything from the building of the huge sets and ""Big-atures"" to designing the props, costumes, finding locations, special effects, music, training the horses, etc....There are interactive maps to follow the path of the various characters, abandoned film concepts, huge design and still galleries, and much more.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2RN2LIRWA60GG	T. Kopf	Great ending to a epic story.  A must see.  Others have touched upon the movie, about how great the effects are, how great the story is, the music, the characters.  Jeremiah Cross's review is off.  &quot;A love story made up out of thin air&quot;, trying reading the appendages in the books you jackass.  &quot;Use made-up languages and subtitles to hide how boring the dialogue would be in English&quot;, Tolkien was a great studier of languages, and used his knowledge to compose 3 languages for the books, I find Elvish to be a beautiful language.  Jeremiah I think you should re-evaluate your movie viewing judgements because the Matrix was an ultimate let down of a trilogy, first one was great and the 2nd and 3rd were complete blockbuster creations that you rip on LOTR being.  You need consistency. Star Wars original 3 were great, the last 2 absolutely sucked and I was the biggest Star Wars fan.  How many academy awards for LOTR?  Yeah and they were just lucky.  Ok Jeremiah.If you love a good film see the original version movies, if you love them and want more read the books and then see the extended versions.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	"The heavily-anticipated film adaptions of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" began in 2001 with THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, a truly extraodinary film. In 2002, it was continued with THE TWO TOWERS, which topped THE FELLOWSHIP. And now, in 2003, we have THE RETURN OF THE KING - a film which rules all others. Here, ladies and gentlemen, is a serious candidate for best movie ever made.The first part of the film is actually taken from the novel of ""The Two Towers"". We find Pippin (Billy Boyd) being taken to Gondor by Gandalf (Ian McKellen), who hopes to prevent war there by counselling stubborn, angry Denethor (John Noble). At the same time, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) lead King Theoden's (Bernard Hill) men into battle.Meanwhile, as they approach the outskirts of Mordor, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam's (Sean Astin) friendship is tested as the scheming Gollum (voice of Andy Serkis) leads the two into a trap. All looks dark for the forces of good.RETURN OF THE KING goes beyond words. Adventurous story, terrific acting, perfect direction, flawless visuals - it is a perfect film. Peter Jackson has done an outstanding job of bringing Tolkien's beloved fantasy tales to the screen. I can think of no one who could do it better.Howard Shore once again contributes the film's score. He creates here music that is more beautiful than the previous two films', much less forceful, with the exact feeling of hopeless surrounding it as is with the movie's characters. This is almost certainly Shore's best score.The acting is terrific, better than the first films, if such a thing is possible. We see more of the characters which were paid lesser attention to in the previous installments. Gollum's character is almost completely re-done.There is no doubt that about 90% of the people who see this movie will shed a tear or too. There are some dramatic, emotional moments to the film, but most of the crying going on will just be because we've come to the end of a magnificent, beautiful journey - which has become one of the most important in cinematic history.THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING is a triumph of modern moviemaking. It goes past the previous two, seemingly unbeatable films to become a serious candidate for the greatest film of all-time. It is sheer brilliance. The Lord of the Rings has been a beautiful experience. It is sad it has finally come to an end. At least it has an ending fit for a king."	5.0	"The new ""King"" of film"	2003-12-28	5	4	1

Yes, Peter Jackson took source material that most people thought was unfilmable and created a (most likely) timeless classic. And like many I awaited with some anticipation the extended version, not for the ""extras"" regarding filming, editing etc (do people really have time to watch all that stuff? Geez, time to unplug a little) but for Jackson to work the same magic he did with the other extended versions.Well, this time the results were more mixed than previously due to two scenes. One, the meeting between the witch king and Gandalf. It was enthralling to see the flaming sword, but breaking Gandalf's staff?? C'mon. I'm no Tolkien scholar (I've read the book a couple times) and realize why they did it from a film making perspective but... no way.Second, and far worse is the Houses of Healing. One of the best parts of the book. A gentle coda between the Battle and the final march to the gates. I was looking forward to seeing it. And what do we get?? A Hallmark special. A sappy song with Aragorn applying some washcloth to Eowyn. I almost grabbed the disc and used it as a coaster. What about Merry? He looked half dead after Pippin dug him out from under a couple of orc carcasses and then he's jaunting off with the rest 5 minutes later.Otherwise, excellent. Extended version of Fellowship is still the best."	4.0	What the....!	2004-12-16	14	5	9

This is not and Indiana Jones type trilogy with three individual stories.  Without one, the other two fail.  Together, these movies make up the most outstanding, monumental and brilliant bit of moviemaking that we are ever likely to see in our lifetimes.  The fact that Tolkien's works are shear genius only makes it more difficult to translate them onto film.  And although it would be impossible for anyone to make the ""perfect movie"" from these books, Peter Jackson came as close as any human possibly could.

I haven't listened to the commentary yet, so maybe this gets discussed there, but here goes.It's extremely clear from the book that the reason Merry's sword harmed the Witch-King was because it was a blade forged by the Dunedain specifically to fight the Witch-King in Angmar.  Since FOTR skips the incident with the Barrow-wights, the hobbits don't get these weapons.  Instead Merry and Pippin get ""elven daggers"".  I don't think these two weapon types are in any way equivalent.But here's my big question ( and I'm sure this has all been hashed out already in some forum ):Shouldn't we assume, when Merry and Pippin are captured by the orcs in Parth Galen, that their weapons are taken from them? Why would Merry in ROTK still have any weapon obtained in FOTR?In fact I really don't know how Tolkien would explain this.Here's me rationalizing: maybe the swords were recovered by Aragorn & Co. after the orc party was killed, and returned to the hobbits at Isengard?In any event it seems that Merry's sword in the FILM version of ROTK is given to him by the Rohirrim, and is probably not magical or special in any way.  So why should it have harmed the Witch-King?But then again, the depiction of the Nazgul is unbalanced even in the books.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1MQPFEETBF1Q5	Totenkopf	"This is easily the 'best' of Peter Jackson's tacky and over-produced trilogy. The characters come off as less dimwitted than in 'Fellowship Of The Ring' and there is far less deviation from the book, the plot of which works just fine, as in 'The Two Towers'.However, once again Jackson, Ms. Jackson & Ms. Boyens contrive to jettison beautiful dialogue penned by Tolkien & to replace it with Hollywood rubbish. For instance, in Tolkien, upon King Theoden's death:MERRYForgive me lord, if I have broken your command, and yet have done no more in your service than to weep at your parting.THEODENIt is forgiven. Great heart will not be denied. Live now in blessedness and when you sit in peace with your pipe, think of me.In the movie it is Eowyn, Theoden's niece, who recieves his death words, which are taken verbatim from 'Return of the Jedi' for some unfathomable reason. Merry and Pippen trade Hollywood dialogue: ""I knew you'd find me!"" etc...Elsewhere: the ghostly warriors summoned by Aragorn look like escapees from the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland; King Denethor is turned into a pathetic whining pansy; one anonymous CGI battle is followed by another until you can hardly stand it anymore; Gimli is reduced to a comic afterthought; the last hour is almost entirely shot in slow motion; every inch of film is underscored by heavyhanded music etc...Having said the above, this is the most involving of the three films, despite its apalling and unnecessary 3 1/2 hour length.Peter Jackson is a hack - a hack of near unlimited energy and creative resources. He has stretched the dollar farther than it has ever gone before in cinema history and I suppose he deserves every dime and accolade he's recieved for completing this unlikey pop-culture watermark. However, he'll not be remembered for subtlety or insight, two things which Tolkien possessed in spades."	3.0	Not All Bad	2004-05-10	214	45	169
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ADS4S2JI2P0DI	Tracy Wythe	In my opinion, this was the best of the three Lord of the Rings movies. I was able to sit through the whole movie in the theater without falling asleep once, which was definitely a good thing. The benefit of buying this on DVD, of course, is that you can pause it if for some reason you get distracted or tired of watching it up to a certain point. I loved the movie so much that I bought the GameCube game soon after I saw the movie. I thought that the ending of the movie was okay, but it could have been done a little better. I'm looking forward to when it comes out on DVD. I love the feeling of satisfaction after I buy a great movie on DVD.

The members of the fellowship in Rohan are warned of the impending attack when Pippin cannot resist looking into Saruman's palantir and is briefly contacted by the dark lord. King Theoden is too proud to send his men to help without being asked, so Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to see that this request is sent. They meet opposition there from Denethor, steward of the city and father of Faramir and the late Boromir. Denethor's family has acted as temporary guardians of Gondor for centuries until a member of the true line of kings returns. This member is none other than Aragorn, who must overcome his own self-doubt before he can take on the role he was destined to fulfill. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue to carry the One Ring towards Mordor, guided by Gollum. What they don't know is that Gollum is leading them into a trap so that he can reclaim the Ring for himself. Though Sam suspects his deceit, Frodo is starting to be corrupted by the Ring's power and the mistrust of Sam this causes is fully exploited by Gollum. The only way good can prevail in this contest is if the Ring is destroyed, an event that is becoming harder every minute for Frodo to achieve. The fate of every living creature in Middle Earth will be decided once and for all as the Quest of the Ringbearer reaches its climax.  ""The Lord of the Rings- The Return of the King"" is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect movie ever made.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A5CWLQF6QO3CN	"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B..."	After all years of waiting, we are finally at the last chapter of the much anticipated trilogy.Peter Jackson has brought us could be said one of his finest work to the audience. Different to the Two Towers, the Return of the King was at its best following all the essential plots of the books. This is something that all Tolkien lovers would want to see.The movie started off with the original Smeagle and the finding of the ring, reminding the audience of the origin and gave Andy Serkis a very good chance of showing the audience what he could do beyond the computer generated skin of Gollum. Then the story quickly dived back into what was left behind in the Two Towers.Peter Jackson did quite a bit of shuffling in time, which in fact gave the movie a more 3-dimensional view compared to the more linear approach in the book. It is good in a way that the audience could feel that events among the broken fellowship members are happening at the same time. So that despite the length of the movie, the audience won't have a dragging feeling at all.Frodo was now struggling between his desire to finish the mission and the greed created by the ring. He could feel the pity in Gollum and had the determination to avoid walking his old path, but the ring is struggling had for its own survival by trying to do its best to seduce the ring bearer. Sam and Gollum were fighting for the trust of Frodo. One meant to be devoted while the other meant to be murderous. Among all parties, this is the one that bear all the weights of the mission.Aragon was also struggling. He was struggling to yield to or to fight against his fate. He chose exile as a ranger to avoid the test of his bloodline as a descendent of the fallen king, but at the same time he knew very well that the road of the king is leading towards him. His urge of choosing cave into him when Arwen gave away her life grace and asked Elrond to reforge the sword of the King to him. It's a road of choice without a point of return - facing the fate and the deaths - also turning down a mortal offer of love from a shieldmaiden who determine to die in the battle for her people she loved. Viggo Mortensen had once again done a very good job for his role as Aragon and should receive all the credits for his work on this character.Legolas and Gimli received less coverage in the last movie and became more of supporting roles for Aragon. Afterall this is a movie about the long lost king, but they did form a golden triangle for the mission to bring back the king to the throne. The paths of the dead part was a bit short but very well done with the devoted performance of the party. Gimli as usual gave us the comical moments in serious battles and Legolas had all the stunts his fans want to see. The absence of the elves in the battle scenes of the last movie provided quite a bit of show time for the highly mobile elf to demonstrate what he could do.Merry and Pippin were broken apart this time each carrying a different mission and go into war and wield their swords. Pippin had grown a lot since the fellowship first formed but had not grown out of his stupidity yet. However he managed to redeem himself for certain deeds that he had done to save Gondor from the impotent Denethor. Merry went to war and determined to fight for Theodon till the end. He was aided by Eowyn who disguised herself with the determination to die. She was ruthless to the Fell Beast and the Nagul King. For Eowyn, she thought she lost all hope when the man whom she thought could understand and love her declined her before marching into the Path of the Dead. Miranda Otto did a great job as Eowyn and in this movie, she did receive more attention than she had in the Two Towers.There are lots of friendships and relationships in the Return of the King in addition to the actions around the Middle Earth. Sam and Frodo trust crisis, the triangle of Aragon, Arwen and Eowyn, which both ladies were willing to die for the man they loved, the interesting friendship betweeen the unlikelies - Legolas and Gimli, the love of Elrond for his only daughter, the love and hatred of Denethor for Boromir and Faramir, who are both his sons, Gandal as a mentor to Pippin and the devoted but unreturned love of Faramir for his father. All these made the movie more than a mindless action pack big budget movie - and this is the reason why we love Lord of the Rings. The producer surely had transformed all the imaginations of the fans about the books into real life without disappointing them. Although there are still bits and pieces of the book that are essential but not being shown in the theatrical release, they would be no doubt be inside the extended DVD version next year - for we have seen some of them in the trailers and the official pics. This version would also be long anticipated as the movie, but at the moment the movie would surely rule the theatres for quite a while as this is a movie that you would want to revisit again and again to get the most out of it.	5.0	A spectacular ending to an all time favorite trilogy	2003-12-26	5	4	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	Like the previous two installment films of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, there are some things that Peter Jackson changed from the books; some things that were left out; and a heck of a lot done right.  THE RETURN OF THE KING is a monumental piece of cinematic spectacular. It is true to the spirit of the original work and brings the series to a bitter-sweet conclusion.  The acting is wonderful (especially for a fantasy film), the special effects unlike anything ever seen, the story remarkable, etc. Even if you missed the first two films (and especially if you saw FELLOWSHIP but missed TWO TOWERS) this is the one you definitely want to see before it leaves theatres. Besides some nit-picking things changed from the novel, the only complaint I have about the film is how long the first half of the last fourth of the movie went. I mean, it takes forever for Frodo and Sam to climb halfway up Mount Doom and then it goes on even longer as the Frodo dangles the ring over the pit before succumbing to it's temptation. Other than that, this is the shortest and best three and a half hour film you'll probably ever see.	5.0	The End of the Fellowship.	2004-01-12	2	2	0

In the winter of 2003, audiences that were left numb and confused by the ending (or lack thereof) of the first installment of the LOTR trilogy two years earlier flocked to the theaters, now fully inculcated into sheeple culture, knowing they would ""like"" this film before they even laid eyes on it. After all, the critics had already unanimously told them that. And fans of the novelized Middle Earth trilogy weren't seeing this film at all-- they were seeing images onscreen that filled in or replaced portions of their own memory of a masterly literary work. With such a powerful emperor, having no clothes no is trick at all.Yet to the utter shame of the film establishment, this movie truly is the emperor with no clothes. The one-dimensional, caricatured characters, in most cases soulless as they ""come to life"" on screen, the easy maudlin sentimentality, the sickening predictability, and the embarassing self-consciousness of this film have all too often been overlooked by overeager fans. All of this comes on top of two cinematic tools that can only be described as the ultimate embodiment of the worst cliches in hollywood filmmaking that emerged from the blockbuster era of the 1990s: The replacement of art with grandoise special effects, ala Jurassic Park (1993), and the overreliance on a massive battle scene, ala Return of the Jedi (1983) and Braveheart (1995). The thing with cliches is that once created, they tend to crescendo as they are used over and over again, until they finally come into form in one film that so overuses them, in such a hideous way, that they finally begin to fall from favor. And hopefully this is what LOTR: Return of the King has done for these two particular cliches. Yet it's not until you're done watching this giant monstrosity that you realize you haven't seen a masterpiece-- no, you've been knocked over the head with a blunt object so strong, with such unprecedented pretensions at sagadom, that you don't know what hit you.Hopefully, LOTR:ROTK represents a turning point in Hollywood cinema.

I'm sick of ""purist"" Tolkien fans who complain because it's not exactly like the books down to every last word. Well guess what? It's called ARTISTIC LICENSE. Some things that work beautifully (and they do, most definitely) in a book just can't happen on the screen. I love LOTR, I'm obsessed with it, I've got the One Ring around my neck right now, I can relate anything to LOTR, etc., but I'm not so uptight as to squash the fun out of anything that isn't purely and completely Tolkien. Such additions to the story as the Drinking Game between Legolas and Gimli are simply amusements which spark wonderful inside jokes.But now I do have to say some bad things. I was pretty disappointed with the Houses of Healing scenes, they weren't long enough and didn't show much. But the important thing is that they didn't affect the movie overall.I was also disappointed with the scene at the beginning with Saruman. I loved the fact that most of the dialogue (up to a certain point) was straight from the books, but the way it was acted seemed almost fake. I can see why this scene was originally left out.But of course overall I LOVE this movie! And the special features rock.

It had me glued to my seat (even during the intermission ;-) thinking about what I have seen).Peter Jackson said that he'll make this movie so great that this movie would be the reason to make the previous two parts. He is absolutely right!!I don't remember seeing any movie which made such an impact on me (after The Matrix). The movie is a combination of special effects, emotional sequences, great acting and all the ingredients of an Epic.Even if you have read the book, you won't mind the slight bends peter jackson has made in the story.There were some instances where I feel the special effects team would have done more work. Initally when Eovyn is seen at Rohan's fort from a helicopter shot, the smoke seems to go inside hut's chimney. Also in the end when Frodo went inside the Mountain of Doom, he seemed to float on the way.There would be many more small glitches but I just couldn't get my senses off the movie to notice them.I would definately advice you to run to the movie theatre near you!!!	5.0	Truely amazing movie	2004-03-18	2	2	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2329GPAT2XIIZ	Ultimate Reviewer	"Though this may sound contradictory to other reviewers' raves about this movie, I have to admit that I was well and truly bored of the rings by the time it had ended. After episode 2, ""Return of the King"" is just more of the same stuff - battle scenes with orcs, doubts and soul-searching on the part of the defenders and that irritating Gollom thing talking to itself and, as we know it is going to do even if we haven't read the books, try and steal the ring. It's so obvious. I just wish they had lopped off his head and had done with the ugly thing in the first 5 minutes. Is it just me or does Gollom look just like Dobby out of Harry Potter? The result is something quite unexceptional in either case. I can't deny that ""Return"" is well directed and acted, and the mix of CGIs and real characters was not overbalanced - that's something George Lucas should learn from! It's not the fault of the filmakers that the movie was so boring, but of Tolkein the writer! When the ring finally met its demise, that should have been the end of it, except maybe for a scene at the end to show that everyone is alive and going to live happily ever after, but instead the story just drags ona nd on which accentuates the anti-climax of the ring being thrown into the lava, which was noting special either, after about 8 hours-worth of film by that time! For some reason Frodo goes off on boat, but we are not told why. Maybe Tolkein was thinking writing another Middle Earth trash...I mean trilogy, who knows? I'm just glad he didn't."	3.0	Bored Of The Rings!	2004-01-12	32	3	29

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AID8OJP77VK6Y	unicornelia	The LOTR trilogy of films is a beautiful, perfect set that will live on forever in homes and in 'favorite movie' lists. Each one simply got better and better until we reached the glorious Return of the King. Very long film? Oh, yes. It doesn't feel like three hours, but it approximately is, and though you'll need to set aside lots of time and be prepared to watch for quite a while, you'll want it to go on at the end. Indeed, there are many points near the end when it feels as though the movie's over, yet it goes on. However, the story is so lengthy, intricate, and amazing, that it would be impossible to do it otherwise. Everything needs to be wrapped up for everyone; a drawn-out conclusion is not only necessary, but for those who truly appreciate brilliant movies, heartily welcome. In fact, the ending of this movie is one of the biggest tear-jerkers I can think of.Excellent special effects and long action sequences do not detract from the magic of the books; they only enhance it. The object of these movies was to translate the books to the screen in the best way possible, and without distorting them gruesomely. In this the moviemakers, ALL of them, cast and crew, have succeeded most admirably. As Peter Jackson reminds us time and again in the special features, the effects could easily have overwhelmed the story. Thanks to him, they did not.Every last character and second of these movies gripped me and made me into an instant LOTR fan; I read the books only after seeing these excellent movies. It's a magnificently told fantasy story for everyone--children, parents, and others. Such a marvelous achievement is very, very difficult not to adore. Watching the LOTR movies is a thrill from beginning to end. No conclusion could have been better than the Return of the King. This is another rare example of moviemaking at its very best. And to add, the DVD is BRILLIANT as well; no audio commentary, sadly, but enough documentation, music videos, etc., to keep one entertained for a very, very long time. The interviews with the cast and crew are INCREDIBLY insightful; it's unbelievable how much more there is to know about the movie! Its making seems to have been an adventure in itself.Very few tales can compare to the majesty and splendor of LOTR, and it could not possibly have been made into a better film series. See them sometime in your life.	5.0	An astounding masterpiece.	2004-09-01	2	1	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1ZIXUQYLMKEWI	unmeel	"I have read the Lord of the Rings. But the sheer nagging pedantry and quibbling of some Tolkien fans here borders on obsession. EVERY book that has EVER been put to film has been significantly changed, and often the most slavish adaptations are the WORST (Da Vinci Code, first Harry Potter movie, etc.) Yes, they both tell a story, as one reviewer astutely pointed out. Congratulations, sir, you are truly this generations Galileo. A novel can be more relaxed in its pace, has the advantage of being able to describe and explore its characters inner struggles and mindsets, and has more room to explore side characters, plots and settings. Few authors expect readers to finish their books in one sitting, let alone a book like The Lord of the Rings, and the books are not written so that you can do that and enjoy it. Yet Peter Jackson has to create a movie that people WILL sit down, watch, and enjoy in one sitting, where he has to tell the story visually, generate a greater amount of more obvious drama, and satisfy a general movie-going audience with a great story. Simply putting RotK page-for-page on the screen DOESNT work. Don't believe me? Try it.Several reviewers have become ""outraged"" at Peter Jackson for ""daring"" to make changes to Tolkiens ""masterpiece"". How the hell do you know that Tolkien himself wouldnt approve of the changes? Are you the appointed guardian of Tolkien's books? I mean, just who the hell are you, anyway? Tolkien didnt write a screenplay, he wrote books. Books are not screenplays, nor can screenplays be written by taking the book and regurgitating it. As for those complaining about Tolkien's ""beautiful dialogue"" being ""ruined"", get a grip. ""Hinder me? Thou fool! No mortal man may hinder me!"" That may work great at a rennaissance fair, but not in a movie, sorry. And do we really want Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas singing a maudlin song about Boromirs death like in the books? That would be utterly idiotic on screen. I would probably start laughing.Another ridiculous statement: ""The use of CGI in movies is never acceptable."" Please, TRY and make these films without computers. Yes, lets create our very own VOLCANO and have it explode; lets create a Giant Spider ourselves and some REAL 30 foot elephants!  Or maybe we can sit around waiting for a huge FLAMING EYEBALL to just fall out of the sky so we can film it, right? Your mind is closed like a goddamn chastity belt; open it up.The Movies are NOT the Books. If you want the books, read them. The movies are not reaching out and strangling the books for you.I'm glad we have film adaptations that have so brilliantly captured the major themes of the books, and have been true in so many details, while working superbly as FILM. As CINEMA. As MOVIES. In fact, some of the changes work better than the material in the books; Faramir is a more interesting character; Frodo, Sam and Gollum have more tension between them; and having Arwen save Frodo at the river was a fine decision, because Glorfindel is a character of NO importance to the books WHATSOEVER. While in the books, Arwen shows up at the last minute and marries Aragorn, which is a development with no buildup whatsoever.Several other changes are necessary from time constraints- Denethor being less developed, no Scouring of the Shire, etc. About the only major change that I didn't like was the removal of Saruman's scene, because that is important and should have been fitted in."	5.0	A response to Nigglers	2006-06-19	10	7	3

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1NDYL6D6QNVCI	"Valnastar ""Man With No Name"""	"Making a decent film version of LotR has always been considered nearly impossible, yet somehow Peter Jackson pulled it off. In spite of the need to eliminate parts of the book for the sake of the cinematic medium, much of the emotional power and magic of Tolkien's storytelling remain. While the scenes of Frodo struggling up Mt. Doom may seem a bit long and probably could have been a bit more effective if a bit shorter, otherwise, this is an exciting film with real character development and strong emotional content. Don't let complaints about ""numerous endings"" throw you off; the final scenes of the film do their best to wrap up all the open storylines much in the same way that Professor Tolkien did in his book, and it's very satisfying to watch. Keep a box of tissues next to you if you're the emotional type.My one complaint about this film was that of all the scenes from the LotR book to omit, how could you cut the scene where the two most powerful antagonists, Gandalf and the Witch King, face each other? This is a key moment in the story both dramatically and as an exciting piece of action, and I've never been able to understand the editorial decision to cut that scene, but thankfully, that footage, which appeared in pre-release trailers yet was cut from the theatrical film, is restored. Also appearing in the extended DVD version are the many moments with Christopher Lee as Saruman that were cut from the theatrical release.I'm anxiously looking forward to this extended DVD version of the film, more so even than I was the theatrical release a year ago.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	ASIVEVVD8V02A	"Veon ""Veon"""	"When I was in eighth grade (and had one of the most excellent English teachers ever), I was commissioned to write a review for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. That was probably one of the most passionate pieces of writing I have ever produced. Seeming that I have recently been playing Lord of the Rings computer games and reading fantasy material, I decided that it was time to return to Middle Earth and write a review for The Return of the King.Be forewarned, however. I am far from an experienced film critic, but I am a well-seasoned fanboy-especially for the works of Tolkien. He, along with C.S. Lewis, holds an almost idolatrous place in my heart. This does not make the task of reviewing this film any easier-quite the contrary. If I were writing a review for some dime-a-dozen comedy or drama or chick flick, I would be able to give my opinion easily and straightforwardly. There is no vested emotion in that. But my best friend and I had reserved our seats for this movie weeks in advance, at the first showing, on opening night. I had been visiting theonering.net for years, keeping up with the latest rumors and spoilers. I had posters with Gandalf and Balrogs on my wall, action figures of Aragorn on my dresser. I cannot give an unbiased (or even entirely rational) review of this movie. Just as the creators of this film produced this masterpiece for me, I feel obligated to provide a worthy tribute to their work. You have been warned.The Return of the King is the culmination of nearly a decade of work by one of the finest filmmaking teams ever assembled. At the helm was visionary director Peter Jackson, accompanied by screenwriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. WETA of New Zealand provided the visual effects under the artistic direction of Richard Taylor, and guided by the highly regarded Alan Lee and John Howe. New Line Cinema provided the financial support for the trilogy, without which this film never would have been produced (at least in the same form). New Line had quite a bit riding on this venture; their fiscal faith was the enabling factor that gave LotR the chance to be made the right way.By this point-unless you've been living in a hobbit hole-you've probably seen the movie and know the plot. Just to refresh the memory, King revolves around two quests. Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) make their weary trek across Mordor with schizophrenic Gollum (voiced/motion captured by Andy Serkis) to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Meanwhile, the men of Gondor and Rohan must hold off the armies of Mordor, allowing Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) to take his rightful place as king. The future king rides with elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and comic relief dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) to enlist the help of an undead army. King Theoden of Rohan leads Eomer (Karl Urban), Eowyn (Miranda Otto), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and legions of cavalry to aid the faltering forces of Denethor (John Noble), steward of Gondor, and his son Faramir (David Wenham). Wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) alternates between directing Gondor defenses and keeping Pippin (Billy Boyd) out of trouble. This convoluted plot will no doubt prove daunting to viewers who have not read the books, but as one has seen the previous two installments in the trilogy, the interweaving storylines are manageable.The stellar acting which audiences enjoyed in the first two movies returns in King. As John Rhys-Davies commented in an interview, the casting for these movies was ""spot-on"". There's not a bad performance in the entire bunch, and only by entering the netherworld of nit-pickiness can real criticisms be made. Viggo Mortensen, while aptly portraying the humility and quiet strength that Aragon possesses in the books, never seems to truly step out and become the strong leader we expect him to be. Arwen (Liv Tyler), Aragorn's love interest, decides to give up her elven immortality to be his bride, but that sacrifice doesn't seem to elicit the emotion that such a choice should. Gimli seems to have been reduced from the gruff warrior he was in the first movie to the butt of the movie's jokes, although that probably reflect more on the screenplay than on Rhys-Davies' abilities. The screenplay may also have been a limiting factor in the portrayal of tragic Lord Denethor. John Noble endows the character with a brilliant touch of Shakespearean madness and fallen grace, but in the end simply does not give a convincing cause for his madness. Many people walk away from the movie asking ""what was with that guy that set himself on fire?""While it is difficult to find weak points in the performance of the cast, it is easy to pick the standout performances. Gandalf really comes into his own in this movie. When Gandalf the Grey underwent his resurrection in the second movie, I was a little disappointed with the slightly more two-dimensional Gandalf the White which replaced him. In The Fellowship of the Ring, Ian McKellen breathed such life into the wizard, and that life didn't seem to carry over quite as well into The Two Towers. Well, that life is back. Gandalf becomes the embodiment of the forces of good, a light in dark times. He commandeers the defense of Minas Tirith and commands the troops in a way that we wish Aragorn would emulate. He knows what is at stake, and that sense of urgency and importance is clear to the audience through his character. Another outstanding performance, one that surprised me a little, was Sam. The ""fat hobbit"" had done well as Frodo's protective defender figure, but he really comes into his own in King. We see that Sam is as much responsible for the success of the quest as Frodo is. Frodo calls him ""Samwise the Brave"" in Towers, and the hobbit (and actor) live up to that title magnificantly. I felt far more concern for him that I ever did for Frodo while I was watching the film. Andy Serkis builds on the success he had as Gollum in the last film and proves to the world that a computer-animated character can actually be a realistic figure in a film. He becomes a part of the story that Jar-Jar Binks from Star Wars and Dobby from Harry Potter can't even compare with. The animators have a lot to do with that (and we'll get to them in due time) but I believe much of the power of the wretched creature is inspired by Serkis's vocal performance and his work to capture Gollum's style of movement. He is hideous, awful, and worthy of falling into a volcano, but we can't help but feel some pity for the ruined life he has led because of the ring.The script and screenplay do a fine job of staying true to the spirit of the books while producing a film that would succeed in its own right. The dialogue is believable, fitting the setting and mood of the film well. While the story does seem to lag a little in the beginning, it picks up and gains epic momentum as it blasts to the mind-blowing conclusion. Obviously the enormous battle scenes are a major part of the film, but they are counterbalanced with quieter moments of character development and some tension-relieving comedy. Some departures from the book I could understand (like leaving out the scouring of the Shire and waiting until now to provide Aragorn with his sword Anduril); some I could not. I share Christopher Lee's outrage at having his last scene as Saruman cut from the theatrical version (although the performance is preserved in the extended edition DVD). Aragorn's actions in the House of Healing were sorely missed. And why in Middle-Earth did they make Barad-dur a lighthouse, complete with Sauron as a giant fiery flashlight on top? Despite these purist gripes, Jackson and company are overall successful in their choices of what to include and what to discard. Tolkien was more linguist than novelist anyways, and his story-no matter how grand-needed some editing to become a workable plot. There's plenty of fanservice in the film anyways, from clever wordplay with Aragorn's name (""Hope"" in Elvish) to the final scene, which is straight from the book. Don't worry though: a non-nerd will still be able to appreciate the excellent story and powerful theatrics.The special effects in this movie are, to be succinct, unparalleled. The Star Wars junkies of the world would argue with that, but I challenge them to compare Jar-Jar or (dare I say it?) even Master Yoda to the realistic appearance of Gollum. There's no comparison. I was especially impressed with the buildings and set pieces. WETA designers built scale models of locales like Minas Tirith and Orthanc in order to give the places an added sense of realism that isn't fully achievable with CGI alone. Some of these `miniatures' were dozens of feet tall (earning the name of bigatures from the production staff), and thus the artists were able to put acute details into these models. The effort shows on film. All of the settings (particularly the White City) are outstanding. When CGI was used in the movie, it is mind-blowing. The Battle of Pelennor Fields with its tens of thousands of orcs, trolls, wargs, Rohirrim, dragon-like Fell Beasts, and towering war elephants is too much to take in. The encounter Frodo and Sam have with Shelob shows what live-action acting/CGI monster encounters should be in all movies. That arachnid will give you nightmares. I may have some minor gripes about specific shots (that shot with Smeagol's friend floating through the water made me wince), but it is still my opinion that the special effects of this film have yet to be paralleled-even now in 2006.The costumes/props of this production reflect the fetish with detail the miniature designers and CGI artists had. Nothing in this film looks fake - period. That's because the costume designers, blacksmiths, and other artists didn't cut corners. That sword which Elrond gives Aragorn? It's real steel, foraged much like a king's sword would have been in the late Middle Ages. The weapons are intricately inlaid with runes (which actually mean things in the various Elven languages). King Theoden's armor is fully functional, and is inlaid with a golden horse head-inside the breastplate, where no camera will ever see it. Everything from Gandalf's staff to Eoywn's dress looks absolutely gorgeous. Jackson told the team at WETA before they started production that he didn't want fantasy. He wanted history: something that someone might conceivably see in the Smithsonian. That's the feeling you get from looking at the costumes and armor and weapons in this film: each seems to be a product of distinct cultures, developed over hundreds of years. The Gondorians seem almost Roman with their standardized silver armor and stone cities. The Rohirrim are remenicient of the Celts or other Norsemen, having horses integrated into their architecture, clothing, and weapons. The bottom line is that it not only outstanding, but also believable.With the completion of this trilogy's score, Howard Shore has placed his name up there with the likes of John Williams and other composers of the ages. I am continually impressed with how well the music in these films reflects the drama unfolding onscreen. Just as the arms and armor of the different races have distinct design and ornamentation, the musical motifs of Shore's score make each of the different groups memorable. Rohan's theme is back, with the Hardanger fiddle evoking rustic connotations well suited to the race. Mordor's blaring, tension-drenched theme is just as frightening and just as appropriate as it was in the first two films. Shelob's musical theme, with its high, rapid strings is strongly reminiscent of horror films, and heightens the danger on screen. But what takes the cake is the Gondor theme, at least in my opinion. Its bold brass and excellent crescendos is one of the things that really gives Minas Tirith and the race of men their majesty. This is a worthy foe for the forces of Mordor; the music gives it almost as much grandeur as the special effects.I may be biased, but I am not alone in my praise of Return of the King. IGN.com recently placed Lord of the Rings as number three best movie franchise of all time, and Return of the King is widely regarded as the pinnacle of the series, the grand finale of the project. It is by no means perfect, even by the standards of rabid fans, but no one could have asked for more.

Horn Jr.	I, Like all Tolken fans have suffered through this set of three movies which end with the Return of the King.  I should have known how this set of movies was going to end up when Frodo was rescued by a pretty woman instead of an Elf Lord in the first movie.  But that I could forgive.  I cannot forgive the return of the king.  Having read the books... several times, I know that there were three great moments in this story.  The first is Denathor's speach to Gandolf about the Black fleet.  The second is when Aowyne slays the lord of the Nazgul, and finally Arogons speech to the dead.  I will not even comment on the ending.  I expect too much.  It would have taken five movies instead of three to make things come out right.  I have bought all the extended versions of this movie.  The return of the King is not great.... It is simply all that we have.	3.0	The return of the king	2004-03-12	30	6	24

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A7QYHLIRZLMLQ	"viagrafalls ""Peter Schmitz"""	With 'The Return Of The King', Peter Jackson finishes up the filmed version of Tolkien's 'Lord Of The Rings'. And as the third part of a trilogy deserves, he does so in style.This movie has it all. Excitement, romance, amazing special effects, humour, battles (of course), and a brilliant ending.After the 'Fellowship Of The Ring' and 'The Two Towers', both of which were amazing, many wondered if Jackson would be able to top the incredible job he did. These worries, however, can be set aside. He absolutely managed to pull it off!The story picks up where 'The Two Towers' finished. Frodo and Sam, accompanied by the creature Gollum, try to make their way into Mordor, unaware of the sinister plot Gollum is playing on his fellow companions. The Ring starts to make Frodo's task heavier and heavier, and Gollum is not exactly helping.Merry and Pippin join Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and the Riders of Rohan. It quickly becomes obvious that though the battle of Helm's Deep was won, that was but one victory. Already, Sauron has cast his eye on the land of Gondor, determined to bring down the kingdom of men in one quick mighty blow.Aragorn questions whether or not he is able to live up to the task laid upon him by his heritage: To rule all of men. Only courage and hope will ensure that in this time of despair, mankind will pull through. While it seems like a battle that is lost before it even started, the people of Middle Earth realise it is all or nothing, and go forward to meet the enemy.The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. The heroes we all came to love are cast into the adventure of a lifetime.Jackson manages to tie up any loose ends he had left, and pulls the story back to where Tolkien intended it to go.Without any doubt, this is the most anticipated movie of 2003, and maybe even the century. It was absolutely worth the wait, and it will be interesting to see whether the Oscars will reward Jackson the way he deserves.This is an absolute must-see. 5 stars, and then some!	5.0	Brilliant ending to the trilogy	2003-12-16	3	2	1

Along the same lines, nothing could have been more difficult to make than a finale that out did its predecessors. The Return of the King manages just this feat; it matches the first film [Fellowship of the Ring] and actually surpasses the Two Towers.This 3 1/2 hour epic saga starts at where the Two Towers left off.  Frodo and his loyal sidekick Sam follow their dark mission Mordor to destroy the ring or perish.  Along the way they&#8217;ve picked up Smeagol (Gollum played by Andy Serkis in an amazing performance) who commits his evil mischief.The other members of the fellowship gather around Gandalf and the future king of Gondor, Aragon in preparation for battle against Mordor&#8217;s evil legions. As with the first two films the rendering of Middle Earth is astonishing.  The care and detail given to characters, costume and sets is apparent throughout.Tolkein&#8217;s Lord of the Rings trilogy is a wonderful epic for our time. A deeply religious Roman Catholic who felt himself out of place in the 20th century, Tolkien Middle Earth is a place of good versus evil. Unlike cold modernity, Tolkien made it a place where spirit, brotherhood and determination could overcome adversity.In the end Jackson does a superb job bringing the trilogy to a climax. There are small quibbles to be sure (for example there is no love story in the written story, minor characters are missing, etc.) but Jackson keeps a fairly steady hand on Tolkein&#8217;s vision.  Perhaps those of us who grew up reading Lord of the Rings feel a different affinity to it than most but whatever the reason I think Jackson&#8217;s epic is superb and this, the finale is truly excellent storytelling and mythmaking.	5.0	A rousing finale worthy of Tolkien's legacy.	2004-08-13	2	2	0

O'Connor ""Tialin"""	There has never been, and may never be again, any film, let alone three, to rival The Lord of the Rings trilogy.Just as everyone in New Zealand must have been thanked at the Academy Awards, so everything possible must have been said about Peter Jackson's work of genius in bringing the cast, crew, effects and all other aspects of the filmmaking process together in total harmony. But I will still add my mite, and say that these three movies are no less than awe-inspiring, and as much for the incredible tale of their making as revealed on the extended DVDs (thank you, thank you, thank you!!) as for the experience of seeing them in the theaters.Mr. Jackson deserves a special Oscar for bringing these three films to life in an incredibly short time (considering the almost obsessive attention to detail) and in a budget that seemed massive to the studio but in reality was very modest considering the scope of the venture, and no amount of monetary rewards for all concerned could be too great.A new standard has been set for the art of filmmaking. I hope I see even one more such grand adventure on screen in my lifetime. But I won't hold my breath.Peter Jackson is truly the Lord of the Rings - and he's certainly much more humble than any previous holder of that title!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	Peter Jackson has done a rare thing; he's managed to translate a work loved by millions into an effective, affecting and rich motion picture experience. The third film in the trilogy is no exception. While The Return of the King isn't perfect (and what movie adaption could ever be?), it sticks closely to Jackson's unique view of Tolkien's work. It's also about as close to perfection as one can get without making the film themselves (and very few would be up to the task).Jackson gambles a bit here; he doesn't drastically reduce or rearrange the last book of the trilogy. Instead, he structures the film so that it's dramatically viable. The continuing thread of three interrelate stories works well--we see what's happening to our divided heroes and the impact what they do has on the other. Jackson's added bits and pieces for dramatic clarity and to improve the visual drama but, on the whole, everything is as it should be.While I felt that some of the battle sequences went on a bit too long (just too many shots of giant elephants trampling the riders on horseback), on the whole the film is a huge success. After a brief glance back that helps us understand Gollum a bit better, we spring forward to exactly where we left our heroes. Aragorn and his compatriots are preparing for the final battle in hopes that Frodo is successful in destroying The Ring. While Frodo and Sam begin to have their doubts about their chance of success they trudge on led by Gollum. Meanwhile, the seeds of distrust between the uneasy trio.The visuals are stunning, the action vivd and the performances are strong. Kudos to the entire cast but particularly to Sean Astin who finally gets to shine as Sam becomes the hero he always hinted he would become. Viggo Mortensen's smoldering intensity as Aragorn reaches new heights and his character grows signficantly. When he finally accepts who he is and what he must do, his character comes alive in a new way in this film.Jackson, Fran Walsh and his other collaborators have done a rare thing; translated a great work of art and literature without pandering. The film's narrative richness is what makes Return a film of substance. You care about these characters and their fates.I have heard some complaints about the film having &quot;too many conclusions&quot; but, in reality, the film ends when Frodo achieves his goal. The rest of the film acts as a coda giving us an idea as to what awaits our characters later down the line. While it does seem to drag on a bit after the intensity of the last battle, it provides necessary closure to the film. It was a brave choice and the right one regardless of naysayers.Don't let anyone tell you too much about the film and go and enjoy it this holiday season!	5.0	Epic conclusion to the trilogy	2003-12-20	29	24	5

Collier	"Unfortunately--and despite all the hype, before and after the movie's release--the theatrical release of ""Return of the King"" is the weakest of Peter Jackson's three ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. As beautiful as the pictures are, as obviously dedicated as the films' crew was to making a great film, ""ROTK"" is a jagged, uneven effort that would have greatly benefited from an extra six months to a year of post-production and reflection.""ROTK"" suffers terribly from sloppy editing and screenwriting. The script has to carry an uneccessary load of narrative invented by Jackson and his scriptwriters, slowing down the first half of the movie and leading to the slapdash construction of the second half. You can quote me box office and Oscar wins all day long, but Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens blunder badly every time they step away from Tolkien's plot and into their own ill-conceived storylines. It's a telling point that ""ROTK"" is at its best when adhering to the original story, and at its ponderous, eye-rolling worst when Walsh and Boyens' freshman-year-screenwriting-course rules are invoked.Jackson's decision to cut out ""the Scouring of the Shire,"" while possibly a narrative neccessity due to the extreme length of the film, fatally dilutes the impact of the last half hour. The oft-criticized five endings would have had a real punch if we'd been able to see the hobbits' shock and pain at the sight of their own homeland laid to waste. Pity that Jackson chose to jettison this critical final segment of Tolkien's plot; without it, Jackson's ending is simply repetitive and dull.Look, this isn't a terrible movie. There are some genuinely exiting and moving sections, notably the first half of the Battle of the Pellenor Fields, and any scene featuring Gandalf or Andy Serkis' marvelous Gollum. Unfortunately, the spectacular eye-candy and some nice performances from Ian McKellan, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are often overshadowed by the gross overacting of Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, and a generally weak effort from Viggo Mortensen in the title role.Pity. There's so much good here. The ""look"" is just right, and the resources were in place to do things the right way. Sadly, in the end, Jackson and company should have taken more time to edit the film (why lock yourself in to the one-a-year cycle, once the first movie was a huge hit?) and trusted Tolkien, rather than themselves, to tell the story properly.NOTE:  The just-released extended DVD version is a considerable improvement, particularly in the pacing of the second half of the film.  This in no way excuses Jackson's dumb script decisions in this and the other two movies--which were both also much improved in their DVD incarnations."	3.0	Over-rated!

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3N5XIM9R2OQH0	Wheelchair Assassin	"""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is smarter than your average epic.  And longer.  And more exciting.  And more moving.  In other words, it's just better overall.  Like the first two LOTR movies, ""Return of the King"" flies along at a note-perfect pace, ensuring that viewers won't be looking at their watches even as the film moves past the three-hour mark.  Perhaps the most notable aspect of this trilogy is the way it manages to expertly balance grandiosity and intimacy, and the finale is no exception.  It's truly amazing that Peter Jackson And co. manage to tie up the loose ends from ""Fellowship"" and ""The Two Towers,"" introduce a few new characters and themes, and still find time for some more of the trilogy's own unique brand of action-packed set pieces.Since ""Return of the King"" is the conclusion of a trilogy it only makes sense for it to up the ante from its predecessors, and it does so in a manner that makes ""Return of the Jedi"" and ""Terminator 3"" look like an episode of ""Barney.""  The stakes here are higher, the battles bigger, the monsters scarier, and the Orcs even uglier.  However, despite the film's huge budget and epic scope Peter Jackson's direction always finds time to zoom in so we can see how the events are wearing on the characters, reminding us that Hollywood epics can still be full of emotional depth.  This one runs the gamut, with plenty of heroism and a bit of comic relief tempered by an abundance of fear, conflict, and death.Right from the beginning, it's obvious what kind of movie we're in for.  The movie's opening plunges you right into the abyss, opening with a young Smeagol's murder of his friend for the ring and then the harrowing depiction of his descent into madness and deformity.  Things don't get much better from there, either.  Despite the fact that ""The Two Towers"" ended with the defeat of Sauron's and Saruman's army at Helm's Deep, ""Return of the King"" still opens on a pretty big down note.  Mankind is teetering ever closer to the brink of extinction, and more than either of the first two installments this one has a palpable sense of dread hanging over it.  This is never more apparent than when Faramir leads his soldiers in a doomed charge against an impregnable Orc position in an effort to regain his father's good graces.  At the same time his father is piggishly stuffing his face while Pippin serenades him in a scene eerily reminiscent of Nero playing his fiddle while Rome burned.  Moving stuff, to be sure.Even though it doesn't even constitute the climax of the movie, ""Return of the King"" is highlighted by a sustained action sequence the likes of which you can scarcely conceive.  I don't think it would be much of a stretch to say the battle at Minas Tirith is quite probably the greatest ever filmed, taking up about a half-hour of screen time and probably costing enough to end world hunger for good.  Here's a quick laundry list of a few key elements: flaming catapulted rocks; elephants ridden by crews of archers; flying, shrieking Nazguls; the return of the malevolent Witch King; an awe-inspiring cavalry charge; and a tide-turning army of ghosts.  Not to mention, the cinematography involved is nothing short of staggering.  My brief rundown hardly suffices, though; this is truly a scene that must be seen to be believed.Of course, even if they don't register quite as much as previously, the journey of Frodo, Sam, and Smeagol still remains the central point of the action.  Their trip to Mount Doom becomes progressively more difficult and hellish, moving through ever harsher terrain, with Smeagol's treachery only serving to undermine the mission even further.  The bond of friendship between Frodo and Sam, which held them together through so much difficulty in the first two movies, becomes strained as they come closer to Mordor and Smeagol gets more devious.  As before, there's a sense of impending disaster lurking just around the corner, but it becomes more pronounced at every turn.In the end, ""Return of the King"" is not only the last LOTR movie; it may well be the best.  I could even go so far as to say that LOTR has assumed a lofty position as THE movie Trilogy, since it manages perhaps more than any other to match its huge budgets with a huge heart.  I guess only time will tell.  Now to read the books!"	5.0	Worth seeing...twice	2004-01-31	5	4	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A22FY6FPTT6ST7	White Lotus	"This movie brings closure. I was anxiously waiting to see what was going to happen to Frodo and Sam as well as the rest of the fellowship. The ending will surprise you. Since I read the book, I already knew what was going to happen, but the movie was very enjoyable nonetheless. There were some let downs from the book. As one reviewer pointed out earlier Aragorn goes into the ghost mountain to summon up a ghost army. The way this scene is portrayed in the movie does not seem too scary. You can tell the director tries his best to make it seem a seriously imposing task, but I think he comes up short. To tell the truth, (for me) this was one of the scariest moments in the book. In fact, after they come out of the mountain I think it was Gimli that says something to the effect of ""if I knew what I know now what was inside that mountain I would never have gone in there no matter what the cause"". He never says that in the movie though. Also coming up short was the portrayal of the Nazgul. The way these creatures were portrayed on the screen made it look like they were being nuisances, swooping down and picking people up here and there and dropping them to their deaths. It was not made clear to the audience that these creatures were not just physically imposing but they were also extremely powerful wizards of evil. That was why Eowyn became so ill after killing the Lord of the Nazgul. He never touched her directly, but anyone who dares kill or maim the Lord of the Nazgul would suffer terrible consequences simply because of their tremendous magical powers (they would be cursed).  One of the scenes in the book was breaking down the gates of Minas Tirith. That gate is supposed to be so strong as to be unbreakable. After attempts to break it open with their battering ram, Sauron's army was unable to open it. However, the Lord of the Nazgul swooped down, and with one magical flash he brought the door crashing down and then they were able to enter into the city. This was portrayed totally differently in the movie where Sauron's army used a battering ram (shaped like a pig or something) and rammed the door down. This was yet another opportunity lost to show the power of the Nazgul. There was only one other major change made in the movie and it deals with the very end but I don't want to spoil it for anybody so you'll just have to watch the movie. :)"	5.0	Awesome Movie	2003-12-20	5	2	3
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2AX7GKSLSTCE5	"Whitney L. Christie ""nvnohi"""	My personal favourite was Two Towers (the second one).  At first I thought The Return Of The King was less than perfect - certain aspects about the ending sort of drove me nuts, fading in and out and such, but once I watched it again and knew that was coming, the story itself was more easily digested.I'm 27, and not sure why anyone would assume this to be a child's movie.  Personally, I don't think a child of 8 or 9 should watch something like this unless they're particularly mature.  The movie has its share of violence for one, and for another, there's a lot more to the story than just dwarves and elves running around smacking rubber-masked creatures.  Fantasy and Sci-Fi movies are an excellent escape from the mundane for both young and not-as-young alike (assuming they're into that sort of thing).  And, despite all the makeup and screaming, many of them actually have moral and/or spiritual teachings in them.  The LOTR trilogy is one outstanding piece of work.  John Jackson gets my applause for bringing to the big screen one of the greatest stories ever written.  The ability to hold such a story together for nine hours is admirable to me, and even better was the fact that it was humourous, gross, loud, soft, tender, sad and thought-provoking all in one set of movies.	5.0	Awesome, and by no means a child's movie	2004-06-23	2	2	0

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3FZGQPFOESL7J	Wil	As with the first two extended cut DVDs, Peter Jackson and company have outdone themselves in packing the discs with plenty of behind the scenes extras and new scenes, some of which generated much hand-wringing from the Middle Earth fanbase over whether or not they would be included or not. One scene was the Saruman death scene at Orthanc. This is found here and is played out quite nicely.Another scene is the Houses Of Healing and the subsequent connection between Eowyn and Faramir. This too is found here and is acted marvelously.One scene not found here that irked me -- and many fans -- was the lack of explanation concerning Denathor's madness. Alas, all we get is a very ambiguous reference when Aragorn reveals himself to Sauron as the King when he finds the Palantir wrapped in Denathor's robes. But the way it is shot you never know if its actually Denathor's pelantir or if its the one Pippin looked into at the beginning of the film. Denathor was a more sympathetic character in the book and comes across as a simple madman here.The extra scenes are wonderful but really add nothing to the plot. Some though, I have to say, are pointless. I never thought I would say this but it is true -- most notably the scenes when Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are on the Paths of the Dead -- having the dead army reject their offer to fight and having all of the corny skulls go rumbling all around them... then to have the army change its mind... really, why??But these minor gripes aside, overall the film is marvelous. They all are, and have raised the bar for future filmmakers. Great directing, writing, acting, and a great set of DVDs.	4.0	Final Installment -- Does It Really Have To End??	2005-03-09	6	5	1

That must be said first.  But in Return of the King, there is simply some things that must be questioned in the story telling.  I know in a film the story must demand certain things, but that speech Aragorn gave to his men was so utterly stupid and embarrassing, it's hard to give the film anything more than a 3.5.  I mean, sure, William Wallace pulled it off BRILLIANTLY in Brave Heart, but this speech thing just backfired brutally.  He was completely unbelievable.  There was no moment likened to when Mel Gibson said, ""I AM WILLIAM WALLACE, and I see an army of my country men...""Come ON.  Who thought of this?Also, why make the oldest wisest creatures in Middle Earth look like a bunch of dumb idiots?  The Ents were powerful and wise in Tolkien's stories.  They CERTAINLY didn't have to be talked into going to war by a little hobbit.  Good lord!  And last but not least, Elrond.  What they heck is that person in the film supposed to be?  Certainly not Elrond, the amazingly wise and brilliant Elrond.  Come ON.  He was manipulating his daughter blatantly.  It was just crazy.Other than these three seriously horrible things, the film was AMAZING.  My fav out of the 3 was Fellowship.Again, I don't want to sound ungrateful to Peter Jackson for making these films.  I just wish some parts of the story could have been more true to the characters.BJ"	4.0	I'd give it 3.5 stars If it was an option	2007-08-02	2	1	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A4OSXRZR2BMX8	"William Merrill ""eclecticist"""	(4 and 1/2 stars) Just like the first two films, Return of the King contains so many spectacular scenes.  For example, the scene of the Gondor Regent leaping in flames from the top of Minas Tirith is one I will never forget.  The battle scenes are also just as dramatic -- or even more -- than in The Two Towers.  There's a tremendous amount to absorb visually -- I do recommend seeing the film at least a second time.This trilogy of movies was a classic for the ages, and I will treasure my collection of the extended versions once this final one comes out on DVD (the 4-CD version) next November.  As much as I loved it, though, ROTK is not perfect.  The first hour of the movie is very slow moving, and I also thought the early scene where Pippin curiously handles Saruman's dark crystal ball was very clumbsily filmed.  Those are minor quibbles, though.	5.0	A fitting climax to an amazing series	2003-12-19	4	3	1

Everyone on the cast and crew says its better than #1 and #2 combined. I am a fan of the books and well i have to admit i was a little disappointed with what Jackson did to TTT. But i still liked it and he made up for it with the extended cut. Billy Boyd(Pippen) said that a chief character will die and people are concerned that Jackson killed off Frodo.Well I've read the book and I'll tell you right now that 4 main characters die but three of them are villains. I'm sure everyone knows that Gollum falls into the cracks of doom. The thing I'm worried about is how Jackson kills off Saruman and Wormtounge. In the book, after the ring is destroyed, the hobbits go back to the shire and see that Saruman and Wormtounge have taken it over. Wormtounge eventually betrays Saruman and stabs him with a dagger. Hobbit archers shoot down Wormtounge as he tries to escape. I know Jackson is going to change this around and probably make Gandalf kill him at the beginning of ROTK. And for those of you that don't want to know which hero dies dont read the rest of this paragraph. In the book Theodin King of Rohan dies in battle.I'm pretty sure that is who Billy Boyd was referring to who would die, but who knows.	5.0	Who is that character that is going to die?????	2003-12-03	25	7	18

But it is good to have the more this edition gives us (even though it is a bit discouraging to think how our adiction got us several times each for the movies, then for each edition and now for each extended edition -- even when we saw it coming!) Imagine if all our favorites did the same! The scenes that were cut were very rewarding and made the expense well worth it for those of us that can afford it.But now that we have the whole thing -- this version at least -- and it is not a souped up cartoon but a demonstration of just how powerful this medium has become -- we can really get into a meaty discussion over the comparison. Movies or books? Hopefully both will stand the test of time but what will that test be? I hate to think how many people have not read the books and worry that even having enjoyed the movies they may not be inspired to do so.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3I92PEEL1B62O	"wysewomon ""wysewomon"""	"I saw RotK at the midnight opening and I've thought about it for over a week before writing this review, hoping my feelings would change.  They haven't.  After anticipating RotK for a year, I found myself disappointed in the actual experience.  In my opinion, it just wasn't as good as the previous two movies in the series.Don't get me wrong, this is still a great movie and a fine end to an amazing accomplishment for every one involved.  There are still a great many places that shine, a great many scenes that made the transition from book to film in a remarkable way.  But for me the problem was that there were also a great many places that just didn't work, and, now that this viewer is somewhat through with going ""oooh, aaahhh,"" at the scope and detail of the work, the difference between what worked and what didn't was extremely jarring.In many places the acting/direction was highly melodramatic rather than realistic, and this seemed a huge, huge change from some of the understated presentation of the first two films.  There were a great many slow motion shots meant to convey emotion that I just found silly and too long.  The f/x were overblown in many places-esp. the Paths of the Dead, an interpretation I found  tedious and not at all threatening. And some of the battle sequences--particularly the Battle of Pelennor Fields--went on and on too long without recourse to a human anchor.  I thought Helm's Deep was much better done, and I could have stood about ten minutes less of Oliphants.  In fact, overall I thought there was too much carnage and not enough character.There was not enough Aragorn and too much Gandalf.  RotK is Aragorn's big moment, and I felt his development was thrust aside in a way that I found unconscionable.  His sudden change of heart towards his heritage was virtually inexplicable.  I really, really didn't like that his choice to take the Paths of the Dead was presented as...almost something he was forced into, rather than a strong decision, as it was in the book.  In fact, although the movie RotK actually diverged less from the books than the previous movies, the places it did diverge bothered me a great deal more.  The worst was the role of Arwen and what happened to her.When Elrond told Aragorn about it, my jaw was hanging to the floor because I just couldn't conceive where the scriptwriters had come up with that, or what excuse they had for it.There were other things that bothered me, including the treatment of Denethor, which I felt made him a much weaker character than he should have been.There were great moments in this film.  The arrival of the Rohirrim at Minas Tirith brought tears to my eyes;  Eowyn's struggle with the Nazgul was fantastic, and the scene between Faramir and Denethor broke my heart.  But all in all, I came out of RotK dissatisfied.I heard a rumour today that the extended edition of RotK verges on Five Hours.  Here's hoping that a lot of what I missed will be there!"	4.0	Not as Good as the First Two, IMHO	2003-12-29	15	6	9
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2X3ZCTZ6PUHMC	"W. Zollo ""&#34;the queen&#34;"""	Return of the King hits you on more emotional levels than either of the first two films.  The viewer is intensely drawn into to the characters of Frodo, Sam, Merry &amp; Pippin.  This movie belongs to the Hobbits!Naturally, Jackson has included everyone yet it seems the 'minor' characters own this tale.Eowyn (Miranda Otto) is not only breathtaking but finally shows off her inner courage.  Theoden (Bernard Hill) is splendid, more animated, more a part of Tolkien's world in ROTK than in 'Two Towers'.  Gimli (John Rys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are two major figures who while they share Aragorn's intense journey of self-discovery 'don't' figure much in the film.Viggo Mortenson is even more credible as a man on the verge of greatness.  He has found his comfort level in this conclusion of the trilogy and does it with a soft-spoken style and intelligence.Yet, primarily, ROTK is an emotional film about friendship and relationships.  Sean Astin (Sam) and Ejiah Wood's (Frodo) bond reaches a height most of us could only dream of.  Astin is fantastic, as he suffers along with Frodo. And Gollum reaches new heights of treachery as he guides the two Hobbits to Mt. Doom.I cried in the theater and I sniffled at home with these characters so brought to life by Jackson's wonderful direction.This is a movie for the ages.  The viewer can 'almost' forget the special effects for the trust, friendship and yes, fellowship that abounds in Return of the King.	5.0	CLASSIC!	2004-05-25	0	0	0

Saw all the shows in the theater originally and can say I've seen the series many times now. Decided to rewatch all 3 after I viewed the Hobbit which I might add was light years better then this.Good) sets are nicely done, it's pretty to see, Gimli as comedy relief is ok, Eowyn is cute, and did I say the scenery is very nice.Bad) I personally do not see how any of the supposed fans can rave over this fiasco. Destroyed the books, and ruined what I consider one of the best fantasy tales written. Most -not all but most of the actors stank! Elijah Wood was terrible. Did the actors or for that matter the director even read the series at some point.Look I don't want to rant completely over the butchery of the proper tale, yet their was no real story here. All the depth and nobility of the characters was horrid. I can truly understand the necessity of cutting aspects out for time but the Director really blew it with what he chose to keep and invent.Should you watch it - sure - buy it why not - BUT to toss accolades on this junk as Marvelous, Fantastic, true to the story, amazing performances is complete hogwash. My 1 star is for the butchery unequaled since the Dune junk put out.Do yourself a favor - READ the books, at least you'll have some imagery to go along with it.	1.0	Travesty	2013-03-18	4	0	4

Any and all female characters were practically left out of the books, Aragorn never had an episode where he fell off a cliff, and Haldir wasn't even at Helm's Deep to be killed there. Eomer was at Helm's Deep the entire time, and it was some extras who showed up at the end. Also, Faramir wasn't just badly potrayed, his movie self was a complete antithesis of his book self. As he said when he first discovered the ring in the book, ""Even if I found it alone on the roadside I still would not take it."" They made Treebeard just plain stupid, whereas he was extremely wise in the books (and an awesome character). They also have been waiting for whatever dramatized reason to give Ragorn the Sword of the King until later, when he gets in in Fellowship in the book. By the way, in the book it is called Andurill, but in the movie it is totaly different bt I forgot what it was called. Also, in the movie apparently the force that attacks Minas Tirith is 200000 orcs, but in the book it was more like 20000."	5.0	Most changes were pointlessHollywoodized additions	2003-12-02	19	6	13

Waters	I won't review the film itself, since bazillions have already done so and if you're reading this you've probably seen the film and are considering whether to buy *this* DVD. :-)First, let me say that I own both the theatrical and extended DVD versions of Fellowship and Two Towers, and I fully intend to get the extended Return of the King when it comes out. There is no question in my mind about the tremendous cinematic achievement these films represent.If you are the type who loves both the theatrical versions and extended versions of the films, then get this DVD.If you're the type who has to own absolutely every little bit of LOTR film memorabilia, then get this DVD.If you are the type who really gets off on lots of cool DVD extras, then this release may disappoint you.Of the three full-length TV documentaries included, the first two are essentially the same, with the same interviews, the same stock footage, even the same narrator. They were produced by the same company, Arden, to air on different TV channels, but they are essentially the same show.Then there's the National Geographic &quot;Beyond the Movie&quot; documentary... Oy. Don't get me wrong; I've been a NG reader since small kid days. Maybe that's why I found this program so disappointing. An earlier NG special about LOTR examined the mythological and literary roots of Tolkien's world, a subject so rich in linguistic, historical, and literary material that it easily deserved more than the survey-class approach Nat'l Geo gave it. This later NG documentary, on the other hand, really stretches to draw parallels between Tolkien's archetypes and historical figures such as Benjamin Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt. It just smacks of someone's cheesy marketing idea to cash in on the LOTR craze and yet still deliver something of educational value. It's nowhere near Nat'l Geo's usual standard.The rest of the DVD extras are trailers and featurettes from the film's official website. Interesting and cool, but not new. And do we really need to see another ad for Electronic Arts, I ask you?In summary, the movie itself is worth 5 stars, but I'm giving the DVD just 4 because the extras are ho-hum.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A1E1884118VD04	"Yubbystein ""yubby"""	"Though it is totally coincidental that these films were produced during the past 3 years,  they have provided an interesting parallel of events and mood of the world populace..It's written many times that J.R.R. Tolkien did not intend any allegory or analogy to be made between his books and real life.  But, I see real comparisons to current events with those within the story.Try now to decide whether I'm illustrating 'the real' or 'the written'...A power (in the East) which had been reduce some time ago (by allied forces) rises again.  The victors of the previous conflict are now divided, and some refuse to assist and even provide aid to the enemy.  Except for the people of the westernmost land (in this earth) and several 'more eastern' lands of people (with English accents), the only other 'race' to see the danger is that of a 'northeastern' group (usually living a cold, industrialized existence).  Though most of the people of the 'westernmost land' are under the belief that they shouldn't get involved with the troubles of the 'outside world', and foolishly state 'keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble will come to you', some realize that no one is safe in the end, and that evil spreads to every far land in time.  They send a contingent representing their peoples into the land to once again destroy the evil (first thru mountainous areas, then thru a vast wasteland),  experience battles and loss along the way.I can't continue, since the ""real world's"" conflict is not yet over (especially the part where I am crowned king, and get a nice wifey...).  Though the 'two towers' have already been destroyed (coincidentally, the foundation remains intact),  I'm hoping that the exclusion of the 'scouring of the shire' is also reflected in the 'real world'.  The lesson that there is always 'an enemy within' ready to ruin our world was not shown,  but can be seen everyday (even within this discussion list).But, the most important similarity between the films, and current events, is the loss of our 'once great' ideals,  and willingness to protect our land and freedoms (I'm not referring to recent laws which supposedly take away freedom, but only the criminals are complaining), and above all, the willingness to sacrifice one's own comfort, or even one's own life to protect this land and life of freedom for others....  For me, the most emotional parts of the film, are those where the characters show their resign to carry on, though wavering at times, and face incredible odds and torment to get the job done...The people who had those virtues are now all but gone (the blood of Numenor is all but lost),  and what we're left with are hollow creatures who see only as far as themselves, and are ripe for destruction...4 more years..."	5.0	These films have meaning in our time..	2004-10-03	90	8	82

I was worried that I would not be able to find a copy of ""The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King Extended Edition"" for under $50,  and it is not sold in stores anymore.

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"The intensely satisfying emotions stirred by the writing of J.R.R. Tolkien are delivered via an epic quest by all creatures (men, hobbits, elves, orcs, and the like) of Middle Earth.  Well, every quest must have a conclusion, and director Peter Jackson adapts Tolkien's final chapter of the trilogy onto the big screen just as triumphantly as the first two installments.For a basic plot summary, ""Return of the King"" sees the two primary plot-lines of the entire trilogy reach their apex:-On one front, Frodo, Sam, & Gollum/Smeagle finally reach Mordor, but not before a significant detour along the way and a gut-wrenching decision at their journey's end.-In the world of men, Aragorn (with Gandalf's help) reclaims his kingly birthright and leads the denizens of Middle Earth in a final battle with Sauron's minions.  Along for the ride again is the feisty dwarf Gimli, Legolas the marksman Elf, & hobbits Merry & Pippin doing the best they can to contribute to the cause.Simply put, ""Return of the King"" is no better or worse than the preceding movies.  It is just the continuation of perhaps the most incredible fantasy fiction (translated here to the big screen) series of all-time, and incredibly well-done at that.What really stands out with this particular third chapter, however, is the last half hour or so of run-time, where the visuals, music, direction, & acting meld together to create some emotionally rousing scenes.  Because the characters are so real, so full of life, and have been through so much, you will feel as if it has been your quest all along, making those parting emotions feel all the more raw/real.  Let's just say the eyes might get a little misty on more than one occasion.Thus, ""Return of the King"" is a regal ending to Jackson's masterful book-to-film translation.  It has everything that a movie-goer could possibly want: action, adventure, drama, humor, and most of all...heart."	5.0	The End Of The Epic	2012-02-29	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3M7T1V1N1TKDP	Zachary Vail	"It goes without saying that this movie was fantastic to begin with. The classic Tolkien story brought to life, with great special effects, costumes and filmwork. The Platinum Series Special Edition has a substantial amount of added footage, as well as more than one evening's worth of documentaries and ""behind the scenes"" features by themselves, which are almost all fantastic to see.Granted, watching an almost FOUR hour film, when all is said and done, is an undertaking in and of itself (which is why I also have the original ""shorter"" version, a mere ...3 hours). So unless you want to invest the time, you may have the stamina to watch this extended version only once.If you are a die hard LotR fan, you probably already have this anyway. It's well worth buying, as well as the other two films in the trilogy..."	5.0	All of the good of the theatrical version... and then some.	2005-08-12	0	0	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3REAQAU9X2CF9	Zach Berg	This is the best movie of all time. First you gotta thank J.R.R. Tolkien for such a great story. Then Peter Jackson for makeing such a huge story into three wonderfull movies. But The Return of the King is the crowning point of the triolgy, and of all adventure movies.The charecters are one of a kind. Never has there been charecters you come to respect and enjoy(except for maybe the charecters in Star Wars). Frodo and Sam. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas. Merry and Pippin. And of course Gandalf and Gollum. Sir Ian McKellan(Gandalf), Sean Astin(Sam), and Andy Sirkus(as Gollum) are all worthy of oscar. So is Howard Shore the composer of the themes in The Lord of the Rings. Peter should also win for best director, which he is.The special effects are the best I've ever seen. The giant elephants, giant spiders, giant armies, the giant city of Minas Tirith is just amazing, theres no other way of putting it. The other places like Barad Du, Saurons tower, Mount Doom, The Black Gates, Osgilith( sorry if I misspell stuff), The Fields of Pelanor. The Nazgul look as good as ever. Exspecially the Witch King on top of his flying beasts.The battle scenes are the best ever made, with thousands of horse men chargeing to Minas Tirtith.Takeing on Hundreds of thousands of orcs. The army of the dead just swalling the orc armies. There just amazing.The end is just very strange. You know it's the end but you want to see more, just wait for the DVD.	5.0	If this doesn't win an oscar for best movie........	2004-02-14	3	3	0
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	"This movie had it all. It had friendhip, loyalty, madness, love, war, and the most spectacular special effects. You forget you are in a movie theater and it becomes a rollercoaster of emotions. you begin to feel Frodo's burden as the ring becomes more unbearable. The war scenes are gruesome and gigantic in size. The heroism portrayed gave me chills. There were Eleves, giant elephants, giant eagles, hobbits, and even a giant spider. The whole move was played out on a large scale. The sheer hopelessness of the mission had you on the edge of your seat the whole time. You would say to yourself..""that's it, they are all going to die, they are not going to make it out of this one,"" then some twist of events would give you hope again. The length of the movie (3hrs 40 min.) was pleasing. Please go to the bathroom first, because you will not want to leave your seat!"	5.0	LOTR: Return of the King (2003)	2004-10-31	4	3	1

B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	AXFUS7M251XH8	zeromaster	"One mark of an important film is often the discussion it engenders, and the divisions it creates.  Clearly Jackson's take on LOTR has at least achieved that, and probably a good deal more.That being said, I'm more of a purist (where movies from novels are concerned) than a consumer that eagerly awaits each new Hollywood offering regardless of its on-paper appeal.  I found the last installment the most accessible of the three, but we have to remember that Hollywood and its followers believe in the dollar first, and truth somewhere thereafter.  Concessions will be made (and sold, LOL).If you can take that, you can accept the film for what it is: an interpretation; impressive in its creation, but not necessarily as faithful as some of us had hoped.For the purist-bashers, I would remind you that it's unlikely that any of the writers associated with the trilogy will ever have the cajones to create a written work that stands the test of time as Tolkien did. But it's hard not to embellish a classic given the opportunity, no?Film makers that adapt novels have a two-edged sword with which to play: it's relatively easy to determine if the work the film is based on can appeal to an audience; it's a much trickier task to decide how to make it a success on-screen.  Count me in the camp of abridging content rather than inventing it, but what's done is done.There's an old joke about about Cecil B. deMille, something to the effect of ""what I would do if I were God"", connected with his version of the Ten Commandments.  I can't remember at the moment how it goes however.  It's a bit apropos to the film version of LOTR in some ways."	4.0	it's all about choice	2004-12-08	3	2	1
B00005JKZY	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	A2YMFNXSPRVKEW	Z. Fu	I urge LOTR fans to get the extended DVD of ROTK.  The 6+ hour special features on disk 3 and 4 alone worth the price.  They are insightful, comprehensive, and heck of more fun to watch than 90% of films currently out there!One interesting tidbit of information uncovered in special features is that the art department and Weta workshop pressed themselves to meet the tight film deadline because Peter Jackson kept coming up with fresh ideas and concepts.  As marvelous as the theatrical version is, it feels rushed.  To give an idea of the time constraint, Peter did not actually watch the film in its entirety until the world premier in New Zealand.  Further, he went back and shot one final pick-up after a grand sweep at the Academy awards!  (All this is tastefully documented on disk 4.)  Re-editing restored some scenes, expanded others and introduced new ones.  As a result, the destruction of the ring and the subsequent collapse of Barad-dur are visually and emotionally more satisfying in the extended DVD.  They feel operatic. I often luxuriate myself in this climatic sequence.  In ROTK, as in sports, every second counts...all the more reason to get the extended edition!	5.0	Let's not forget the special features!	2005-12-03	3	2	1
