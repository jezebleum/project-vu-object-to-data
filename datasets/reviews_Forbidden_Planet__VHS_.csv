This is no kid matinee offering despite flyung saucers, ray guns and robot...although Robbie is a loveible character with one of the great lines in Sci-Fi: ""I rarely use it myself, Sir. It promotes rust!""  when Adams remarks on the high oxygen content of Altair 4's atmosphere.The film is a big influence on Star Wars: George Lucas watched it constantly when writing the script and Star Trek, too. Gene Roddenberry even gave the Enterprise starship the Pennant Number 1701, the time Addams ship entered the atmostshere of Altair 4.I never tire of the psychological aspect of this film and the way Morbius learns to his cost that a million years of shining sanity can not protect the Krel from the monsters from the Id.&lt;Anne Francis (September 16, 1930 - January 2, 2011).

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	A. Burchfield	"I'd seen this movie on TV a few times over the years and always meant to get myself a copy. The story does have it's plot holes but is still one of the best scifi movies out there, even if it is 50 years old now. Most of the movie actually makes sense! In one scene there's a hologram of Morbius' daughter Alta- it wasn't called a hologram (and wasn't due to be invented for years yet) but that's just a small example of the vision they had in creating this thing. Almost the only appearance complaint even after all this time is the look of some of the outdoors shots and a few of the Krell equipment scenes (in those days it was all handwork and models, no computer effects, so it all looks very well indeed).Any collection of science fiction ought to have it, maybe any film collection period.The Ultimate Collector's Edition came out recently so I decided to get that. The movie is supposed to have been remastered, the sound is great but I thought I saw a little color shifting sometimes, like the color adjustments weren't perfectly even. I didn't like ""The Invisible Boy"" very much (I think I saw part of it on TV years ago)- kind of a 12 year olds plotline, the Thin Man TV appearance of the Robot was more interesting. Forbidden Planet itself is the only thing on either disc that is captioned or subtitled- would've been nice to have that on some of the extra's.It was interesting to see how many of the cast/crew are still living- including the robot creator and the wife of the husband/wife sound FX team. Some of the deleted scenes and lost footage (most of this was just test shots) looked very interesting but none of that stuff was restored- some of it looked like it was a worn video of a worn piece of film it was so fuzzy or scratchy."	4.0	It belongs in any SciFi collection	2006-12-05	5	5	0

Robot was the mold for all others since. Cast/Acting was good, but a little stilted due to the pacing of movies of that date. Story was great. Consider the nothing stories since in SiFi.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2OZBJ58CML9OS	A. Gammill	"Despite the proliferation of sci-fi movies in the Fab Fifties, the truth is, only a handful of films rose above the genre's b-movie budgets and drive-in mentality.  In an age where giant radioactive monsters attacked, and stalwart scientist/heroes battled alien menaces, Forbidden Planet stands proud as an ""A"" picture: A handsomely-mounted interstellar adventure filled with intelligence, wit and wonder.Now's it's the 50th anniversary of this landmark MGM masterpiece, and sci-fi fans (and movie lovers in general) are being rewarded with this deluxe 2-disc release.  You can give that previous ""bare bones"" DVD release to a friend, THIS is Forbidden Planet restored to its Cinescope glory, complete with 5.1 sound.  No matter how many times you've seen it (I estimate having seen it myself at least 30 times over the years), you haven't seen the film look this good.""Amazing! Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet"" is a great documentary, in which we are fortunate to see many surviving cast members.  Leslie Nielsen, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson and others offer their memories of the production.  You'll learn how the ""id monster"" was created, and see Bebe Barron discuss the film's ""electronic tonalities.""  There's also a fun featurette on the creation and cultural impact of Robby the Robot.  ""Watch the Skies,"" a documentary which originally aired on TCM, offers a survey of fifites science fiction.Now, all that would be enough to satisfy most fans.  But MGM goes the extra mile with MORE features.  Most impressive is the inclusion of the 1957 follow-up film THE INVISIBLE BOY, featuring much of the Forbidden Plaent creative team and, of course, Robby the Robot.  It's an often-overlooked sci-fi/fantasy film about Robby's friendship with a boy (whose father could seriously use a parenting class).  There's also an episode of the 50's t.v. series ""The Thin Man,"" featuring Robby, a clip from ""MGM Parade"" with Robby and Walter Pidgeon, and a collection of other Warner Bros. sci-fi movie trailers.Certainly, no fan of fifties science fiction can be without this superb set.  But I encourage even those who aren't familiar with Forbidden Planet to add this to your collection.  It's a deluxe presentation of an acknowledged classic, one you're sure to enjoy for years to come."	5.0	Movies (and DVD's) just don't get much better	2006-11-25	12	11	1

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A19UTUEBWKIZFT	AKN	Space age interior design circa 1956 was the highlight of this for me, along with Robbie the Robot and the very young and nubile Anne Francis, Leslie Nielsen and Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius.The background space age sci-fi sound effects were generously sprinkled throughout to highlight the futuristic drama.Dr. Morbius had the perfect planet of pleasure all to himself with his gorgeous daughter until his subconcious came to life in monster form and almost broke through his barracaded ultra modern interior designed Jetson's style house.The green sky of the pleasure planet matched the avacado green walls, and the rust red soil matched the carpet of his home.  Metal sculpture and sophisticated mid century modern sofas and chairs in metalic mauve fabric brought home the futuristic concept of this amazingly well done movie. Sputnik wall sconces provided lighting.  Whoever the interior designer on planet Altair-IV is, she/he does space age modern design very well.In fact, four themes from the mid century are apparently the inspiration for this movie:1. space exploration2. the resulting concept of ultra modern space age design in furnishing and archetecture3. robots4. Sigmund Freud's concept of the id.Also we see the concept of saucer shaped flying disks represented by the spaceship which can go faster than the speed of light, a physics concept currently believed to be impossible and yet still hoped for in the future as a way to travel to distant galaxies.This movie displays everything we were thinking about in the nineteen fifties as science fiction was just starting to come into reality with the excitement of Sputnik and UFO's orbiting overhead in the night sky and reflected in our new ultra modern design of our homes.  If only they could have inluded a few of the cars with big tail fins of the era, meant to look like rocketships, it would have been complete.Included was the prescient and as of then unheard of idea of young women in micro-miniskirts and bare feet.This movie is a time capsule of our new concepts of the universe circa 1956.  It was a time of great excitement about what might lie out there in space.  The charm of this era was captured gloriously in this amazing movie.	5.0	When the subconcious attacks!	2012-05-13	1	1	0

A bit too cerebral, as was said about ST pilot, lacking intense human emotional drama.  Got a lot of the science right.  Ending a little flat, could have been spiced up, but satisfying.

Great acting and an eerie and unique musical score help meld this  movie's landscape and story into a classic that will live on forever. This  film will live on to represent mankind's vision of the very far future and  how during the years, our views of the future change. Instead of childbook  awe-inspired imagination, today's films are commercialized and cannibalized  to create profit.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A39WF7973S7844	Alex Freeman	This movie is definitely a classic. It has elements that excite and intrigue. I watched this for the first time the other day and was impressed with the level of detail, and the special effects they employed in the film. The 'particle effects' used are still nice even to  this day. The acting is some what dated (wooden), but that's no ones fault, just the way the industry was at the time. The story is good and true science fiction. Over all it's a well done movie, and enjoyable for people of all ages who like SciFi.	4.0	A well constructed story	2014-01-31	0	0	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2TJPLT2K3U49E	Alex in Florida	Go ahead, rub your eyeballs, but you read correctly; this may be the best science fiction movie ever.  Ever.  So many of the best sci-fi writers and movies made since Forbidden Planet were inspired to some degree by this movie, and it's easy to see why.  I've read that this movie itself is based on Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew'.  I don't know if that's shrew (sorry), but can any movie based on Shakespeare be bad?  Consider the excessive amount of schlock that Hollywood has produced over the decades; no, Shakespeare will do fine, thank you.  Please.The storyline won't be covered here, as that has been done so well in many other places.  Okay, okay, here is a very very short synopsis: In the future, an Earth ship goes to distant planet searching for survivors of an earlier expedition, find a mad scientist with dangerous knowledge and a beautiful daughter, all bracketed by a terrible force that can't be stopped.  There.  Happy now?Special effects in this 1956 MGM movie are only slightly dated by today's standards, which is absolutely amazing.  Special effects a good movie does not make (a lesson Hollywood has forgotten or frequently ignored), and in Forbidden Planet they are used only on an as-needed basis, not frequent nor overblown, and serve the storyline without overpowering or interrupting it.  Well done!  In fact, perfectly done.What makes the best movies so good is: Story (again, thank you Mr. Shakespeare), interesting characters (Star Wars epi. I, II, & III: FAIL), and the interpersonal relationships (why? because we're human, that's why).  Forbidden Planet has interesting characters, jealousy, budding romance, murder (alluded to, not shown) a robot, and an invisible, fearsome, &#34;electricity monster&#34; (as my son called it).  What's not to like?  The only thing missing that would ennoble perfection to this movie would be the inclusion of Denise Richards, but hey, she wasn't born yet, so I've got to give a pass on that one.  By-the-way, the 'electricity monster' is visually scary still, even today, which is also amazing.  And the inclusion of the beautiful Anne Francis is just as good as (better?) than Denise Richards.  Maybe.  Your call.Even though the star, Leslie Nielsen, is known for his (mostly) excellent later comedies (Airplane!, Police Squad!, The Naked Gun, etc.), he handles drama well enough (but does comedy better, in my opinion), and Anne Francis is beautiful and beautifully cast as the Mad Scientist's daughter.  Walter Pidgeon's scientist-character really is mad, since he wishes to be left alone, and Pidgeon's acting is nuanced and human, making his character so intimately believeable.  Robby The Robot is worthy of mention, being one of the best robots ever to come from any science-fiction movie or series.  Even the secondary and tertiary characters are respectably acted and believable, however small the part.  Impressive.Mind you, Forbidden Planet isn't the pinnacle of fine acting, but good enough to make the story good and the characters part of it, without distraction or pause.The sets and colors used are reminiscent of the original Star Trek series ten years later, which I feel should not be underestimated insofar as the beauty and cleanliness that it adds--but never detracts--from the story and characters.  Poor lighting, choice of colors, and unnecessary set detail can derail a good story, but that never happens in Forbidden Planet.  All that you see on screen is in a state of equilibrium, and works.  It just seems that the director and producer got virtually everything right in this movie.I'd mention the changes and/or improvement in the Blu-ray version, but my silly Sony blu-ray player won't play it (and a few others as well).Lastly, this movie could appeal to anyone, not only sci-fi buffs, but everyone who enjoys a good story, good acting, and good visuals.  My highest recommendation of any movie, any movie type.  Get it!	5.0	The Best Sci-Fi Movie of All Time?	2014-03-02	0	0	0

But that would be simply restatingwhat other reviews have said. What about George Lucas fessing upto all the ideas and plot devices he conveniently ""borrowed""from this movie and incorporated whole-cloth into his ""Star Wars""series?Like when the spaceship drops out of ""hyperdrive"" at the film'sbeginning. Or when Morbius describes his fellow colonists ashaving been killed by some unknown planetary ""Force"". Or whenRobbie the Robot introduces itself as being fluent in severalhundred ""languages, dialects and sub-tongues""--a verbatim quoteof C3P0 when he first meets Luke Skywalker in the original 1977""Star Wars"". Don't believe me? Check out the movies and decidefor yourself.Sure the special effects, by current standards, seem ratherantiquated. But don't forget, this was circa 1955 technology,and when I saw the movie as an 8-year old kid, I was trulymesmerized, as were most of the audience. It's even moreremarkable when you consider it took all of 22 years & GeorgeLucas' IL&M; computers to produce anything better in the realmof SPFX.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	I find it really interesting to watch these old sci-fi films, not because I generally like them (it is rare when I do) but because the range of quality is so large.  I mean, you can see two films from the same year and find their quality to be light-years (pun intended) apart.  &#8216;Forbidden Planet&#8217;, technically, is a marvel.  Just watch it.  I&#8217;m stunned that this film was made in 1956.  The visual effects are quite fantastic.  The film itself is decent, but the film does tend to drag a bit in the center, and the obvious tendency to throw in a love angle is kind of distracting, but the art direction is stellar and the iconic Robby the Robot is well worth seeing.  I wish that Walter Pidgeon would have done more with the role, since it was rather rich, but he comes off stale and in the end this becomes a decent at best sci-fi film that is more memorable for its technical achievement than its story.	3.0	It sure looks great&#8230;	2014-01-27	0	0	0

"If you're a sci-fi fan, it's hard to have not already seen this at some point in your life (and it could well be the REASON you're a sci-fi fan), and it would be even harder not to love it.This movie isn't called a classic for no reason; it's clear upon watching the vast influence it has had on virtually every science fiction film made since. Especially telling is the ""Star Trek"" inspiration: from the attitudes and behaviors of the crew (more akin to the original ""The Cage"" pilot) to the viewscreen and use of communicators, one can feel what young Gene Roddenberry must have taken with him from this movie. Also, the special effects were AMAZING for the early fifties; and yes, the ""monster"" is animated (although for the purposes of the story, it's VERY fitting that it would be)...but if you gotta have an animated monster, you couldn't ask for a better one than one done by a Disney animator.All the conventions of sci-fi are represented, and the storyline is a very cerebral and provocative one...and seeing a very young Leslie Nielsen in a heroic and romantic role is great...and Anne Francis is very easy on the eyes as well, made all the better by being a strong and intelligent foil, not just there for the scenery...something else ahead of it's time and a template for the Ripleys and the Uhuras that were to follow.All of this depth and thoughtful story, and Robby the Robot too! The great-grandaddy of R2-D2 and C-3P0 (George Lucas had to have had this guy in mind) adds cerebral value, some amount of menace, and even comedic relief to this overall staple of the genre.All in all, if you're an old school sci-fi fan like me, or someone new to the genre wanting to see where a great deal of it all began, you cannot go wrong with this absolute classic.Highly, highly recommended."	5.0	"""Would sixty gallons be sufficient?"""	2010-09-09	2	2	0

Its oversized cardboard box (not a slipcover) opens like a book to reveal the tape stored at right in a plastic tray. At left is a cast list. Picture quality is good on this full screen SP speed dub.THE FORBIDDEN PLANET (1956) is loosely based on Shakespeare'sTHE TEMPEST. The movie was shot on MGM'sWIZARD OF OZsoundstages. Flora from the Munchkin village was recycled for Altaira's garden and dark forest apple tree trunks can be seen. Animation and special effects are provided by Walt Disney's Joshua Meador.SYNOPSIS--All but two colonists of planet Altair-4 are dead; communication with Earth has ceased. Commander J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielson) and crew are sent to investigate this mysterious radio silence. When they arrive above A-4, the sole survivor of the original mission, Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) warns that if Adams lands, his ship and all aboard may be in danger. Morbius' daughter 'Alta' (Anne Francis) has never seen any men but him, now more than a dozen are about to visit.Robby the Robot was taken out of mothballs in the mid-1960s for two episodes ofLOST IN SPACE. Robert Kinoshta designed Robby and LiS's robot, thus their similarity in appearance and function. Robby's voice is Marvin Miller, best remembered as check-bearer Michael Anthony on TV's THE MILLIONAIRE. The robot's cramped interior was inhabited by little Frankie Darro. For years Darro was a juvenile star in 'B' pictures, even until age 30. Forced to do all his own stunts as there was no one Frankie's size available, stunting became a second career once he was too old to play teenagers.COMMANDER ADAMS' CREW--George Wallace (Bosun) was Commander Cody in the 12-part serial,RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON(1952).Robert Dix (Crewman Grey) is son of actor Richard Dix.This is the last of Jimmy Thompson's (Crewman Youngerford) seven screen appearances. He was primarily a chorister in musicals.James Drury (Crewman Strong) starred in TV's only 90 minute western,THE VIRGINIAN.Richard Anderson (Chief Quinn) played Oscar Goldman on both THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN andTHE BIONIC WOMAN. He was married to Alan Ladd's daughter, also the daughter of Norma Shearer and Irving Thalberg.Jack Kelly (Lt. Jerry Farman) was brother Bart on the TV western,MAVERICK.Earl Holliman (Cook) starred in the firstTWILIGHT ZONEepisode and appeared opposite Angie Dickenson in TV'sPOLICE WOMAN.Peter Miller (Crewman Moran) attacked Margaret Hayes inBLACKBOARD JUNGLE(1955).	5.0	"Narrator: ""In the final decade of the 21st Century, man set foot on the moon."""	2010-10-10	1	1	0

The captain has an executive officer, and a doctor on board ala number one and Dr. McCoy, the list of similarities with Trek goes on and on.My suggestion is to watch the wide screen version, on the opposite side of the disk, turn off the lights and watch it on a large screen if you can. It is well worth it!The actors are great; Walter Pidgeon offers a great performance as Dr. Morbius.

It featured a plot that was far more sophisticated and thoughtful than most movies today, some impressive (for the 1950's) set designs and special effects, and a really weird score. I remember after seeing it as a child, having nightmares about being chased down long, empty corridors by the ""invisible except when exposed to an electrical field"" Lion-headed creature from the film (Alright, I know we were more easily frightened by movies back then, but there was just something creepy about that thing!). I am actually surprised, given the fact that so many mediocre films and T.V. shows are routinely remade (Scooby-Doo?), that nobody has taken a crack at this classic. In the right hands (Ridley Scott would be a good choice),a remake could be quite a hit."	5.0	A Science Fiction Masterpiece	2004-09-22	4	4	0

Templeton	Cannot say anything bad about the movie itself -- a must-see to understand how derivative many later SF movies were.But my main gripe is with the DVD itself: the film print from which it was made was so dinged up and scratched that it really detracts from the enjoyment. The sound track is garbled in a few spots as well. There are some choppy edits that may be either missing footage in this print, or maybe poor choices made for the theatrical release; hard to tell.Finally, there appeared on at least one occasion those telltale circles scratched on the film by some[one]  to alert the projectionist of the coming projector/reel switch.I had the oddest sensation, like that of watching a crummy 16-mm print in a high school auditorium.Evidently Turner rushed this DVD to market without caring to spend the millions necessary to do a full restoration. One hopes that in some dark vault of the MGM archives lurks a cleaner print, so that they will one day reissue this fine classic film in a DVD edition worth owning.But judging from the other DVD reviews, there are evidently two DVD editions extant: the crummy one I and a some others have seen, and a supposedly superb/flawless one, now out of print.

I would seriously not reccomend this to children under 10 since they will get bored and not understand this at all. Also, some of the kids today might not find this entertaining and instead old-fashioned. As fun as this movie is, this is the sad truth and kids nowadays are impressed by video games and other stuff. (Remember when those red and blue 3D glasses were cool.) Sometimes, however, you'll find a few kids who enjoy this! This particular edition should never be put in a decent DVD upconverter.

What impressed me most was the invisible monster, and the vast underground complex of machines (and maybe Anne Francis' legs!). It was science of The Future, and it never lost it's hold on me.So this satisfying DVD set came at a good time for myself, at an age where I can appreciate the art and technology (and Anne Francis' legs!) that went into it's production. As a hard-core science fiction fan, and appreciative of it's Shakespeare, I can relate to the thought and care that this film enjoys.

He shows up in a few other things, of course, including ""Lost in Space.""Leslie Nielsen plays the captain of a space ship (flying saucer design) that is assigned to rescue the survivors of a colonizing ship to Altera 4 that has not been heard from in 20 years. When they arrive, a cultured, mature voice (Walter Pidgeon) warns them not to land. He says he does not need rescuing, and they should go away. But they have their orders, so they are given coordinates for a landing site. They go out and look around, and spot a vehicle coming toward them at high speed, kicking up a huge cloud of dust.Robbie is driving the vehicle. He takes them to Dr. Morpheus' home, where it doesn't take long to find out that all the other members of the crew of the earlier ship are dead, including the woman Morpheus married en route. And all of a sudden, there's his daughter (Anne Frances), very young and sexy, and knowing nothing about men. The spacemen have been out (all male crew) for over a year, and to them, she looks like candy.Of course she falls in love with the captain. Rank has its privileges, you know.Meanwhile, there is some sort of monster out there, and Morpheus says he doesn't know what it is. But he shows the captain and his officers the huge machinery of the Krell, who died out in a single night millions of years ago.Turns out the monster is attacking the space ship, and it's invisible. And if I tell you any more than that, I'll ruin it for you.Good, not great but good, movie. Seen in the context of 1956, when it was made, it's really quite good.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3PGWIZ46WEFBH	Bill Littman	FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the seminal Science-Fiction movies ofthe 1950s, the decade in which ALL the cinematic sci-fi ruleswere written regardless of budgets, production or lo-techspecial effects.  It has a plot remotely linked to Shakespeare'sTHE TEMPEST but also manages to tie in a great adventure storywrapped in a cloak of Freudian analysis, the latter benefitnever once getting in the way of the former.  HOWEVER, MGM, nowWarners DVD has managed to put this terrific film out in onesupremely botched transfer.  The colors are muted, washed-out andtending towards the red scale, while the sound is a boxed-in,mid-range, semi-monophonic joke.  Instead of the full-rangedirectional stereo of the original track, we get mono dialogueand static two-channel presentations of the film's great andunique electronic score.  If you have any doubts as to theseopinions, simply check out TCM Cable's new transfer and compare. Believe me, after tossing this DVD in the [garbage]you will have NO doubts as to what can be done to make thisfilm look fantastic on video.  Save your money for the present and write to Warner video and insist on a remastering.The only reason this review has two stars is forthe inclusion of the long, original trailer.  (Which by the wayuses orchestral music from BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK)  And one morething, Warners...how about a commentary track from Leslie Nielsen and Anne Francis?	2.0	Great movie--Terrible transfer...	2002-07-10	23	19	4

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3BG5AR5KE6QYG	Bill W	"When any list of great Science Fiction films is compiled ""Forbidden Planet"" will always rank near the top.  It is also represents a unique collaboration between MGM and Disney studios. Disney providing much of the out of this world landscapes and Labs. It's sometimes hard to remember this was all done at a time when computers themselves were ""high science fiction"". This accounts for much of the ""cartoon like"" look of the film which in its time was totally convincing wonderfully detailed world(maybe a little dated by todays standards ). Another interesting aspect  is the Krell Architecture it is ""clearly not intended for humans""Doorways are very wide at the base rather the ""human proportions"" for instants. This is one of the few scifi films ever to present the ""aliens"" as as something other than monsters in ""our own image"". Strange also considering the ""ID"" monster.Much of what sets ""Forbidden Planet"" apart from anything before or after is the work of Louis & Bebe Baron ""Sound Tonalities"" what amounts and ""Electronic Music"" and effects track. This represents the Krell music (haunting) it is very unique and distinctive (to ""Forbidden Planet""). Ground breaking to say the least. This is in a day before transitors were common.As one watchs the film it's extremely hard to believe that this was more than a decade before ""Startrek"", ""2001"" and ""Starwars"".But,its all here, Communicators, CD's, faster than light space travel and robots! Of special note is the much loved Robby the Robot. It is telling how much Robby resembles a ""Cash Register""!The Tempest script device is an excellent one as is Walter Pidgeon as the Magician. I do find it somewhat troubling that the script tries to be both adult Scifi drama while also appearing juvenile at times. It appears as if having created a very good adult SCIFI drama based on a Shakespearean play the film makers paniced and trimmed much of the Tempests plotline and replaced it with ""juvenile"" comic relief. This was best done in Robbie's Character but also explains Earl Holliman's (comedy relief) Cookie. (Are those really tin pots and pans?)  It's almost as if there are two different films here. In rereleases ""Forbidden Planet"" has always been as a juvenile Saturday Matinee.  Odd considering adult nature of Shakespeares The Tempest.An other problem is some of the dialogue sounds ""clipped""! Leading me to believe the film once ran much longer than todays (cut for time and double billing) 99 minutes. Some of these edits are included in the earlier Criterion Laser Disc of Forbidden Planet.All in all this is perhaps the best of 1950's Scifi Films. It has been long neglected as a DVD. I can only hope there is a new restoration with commentary and other extras in the works.Postscript:26 Nov 2006""Forbidden Planet (Ultimate Collector's Edition)"" is a mixed bagFirst thing the Print is as good as I have seen!Got to love the artwork the Collector case while ""bulky"" it's beautiful. The Collectable ""Robbie"" Action figure is wonderfully detailed (but careful it is fragile)!  One note on the Lobby cards they are reproduced on a dull matte finish not Glossy? Other extras include the very childish ""Invisable Boy"" what this adds I don't know! Some very informative Documentaries are included (but like many of todays Documentaries they are ""LOVEFESTS"" and suffer from the amount of unrelated bits interviews spliced together). One interesting exception is the Walter Pidgeon' MGM Parade TV spot.  This two disc set includes pieces of an early workprint which will be of interest.Still lacking is a running commentary by a Film historian or critic like Rudy Behlmer or Ron Haver. What is lost in this presentation is develpment (backstory) of the project and criticism. Also I would have included the the ground breaking sound track either on CD or alternate isolated sound track.Missing also are many of the extras from the Criterion ""Forbidden Planet"" Laserdisc including the ""Fatal Planet"" Screen treatment and Text essay and numerous stills."	4.0	Forbidden Planet a classic !

Adams (Leslie Nielson) leads a crew of deep space explorers on a mission to Altair 4, to check on a colony there. Altair 4 is a psychedelic planet with a green sky. Upon arrival, Adams and company find only one man named Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis- one of the sexiest women in ANY galaxy) alive. Morbius explains that the others were killed by some strange, unseen force. Morbius is a solemn, mysterious sort of guy himself, and it's apparent that he's not telling the whole truth. He's built a virtual paradise in the middle of a wasteland, complete with a forest, deer, and a tiger. Morbius also has a robot named Robby, who does all of the menial labor around the stellar estate. Adams and his men soon learn that all is not well on Altair 4. An unstoppable, invisible entity is unleashed, tearing crewmembers to pieces, while absorbing their laser blasts into it's incredible mass. Adams and his first mate learn that Morbius has tapped into a vast computer network (about the size of Cleveland), left behind by a now extinct race of super-beings called ""the Krell"". Somehow, using this network, Morbius can release his ""id"" to do his insane bidding. Will anyone be going back to earth at all? Can the invisible horror be defeated? Will Walter Pidgeon and Anne Francis live on to star together again in Funny Girl with Barbra Streisand? Watch and see.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1P7O2PAA8H1DD	Blade329	One of my favorite movies of all time, period.  This is a classic that I have watched many times.  Never gets old.  A very influential film on future sci-fi movies.  This movie was made in 1956, but really holds it's own.  Terrific special effects for the period.  On blu-ray it looks fantastic.  Totally impressed with the picture.  The story is the strength of the film.  A terrific plot that really keeps you guessing and makes you think.  Loved it.The plot starts off deceptively simple.  It's the 23rd century (Star Trek, anyone?) and a US space cruiser, C57-D, has been dispatched to a distant planet called Altair IV.  Their mission is to ascertain the fate of an expedition to that planet 20 years earlier.  Happily they discover a survivor, Dr. Morbius.  However, he has no interest in being rescued and wants them to leave....immediately.  He tells them he cannot be responsible for their safety on this planet.  Under orders, the captain (Leslie Neilsen) has no choice but to land and observe/investigate the situation.Thus begins a journey into a very good movie.  I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll stop there.  I should also point out that this is not an action movie.  There is some action it in it, but it's not the main point of the movie. This aint Star Trek: Into Darkness, thank God.  This is a movie that relies on story and dialogue, instead of explosions and weak humor.	5.0	Monsters from the Id.	2013-09-25	1	1	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	I first saw `Forbidden Planet' when it was originally released in theaters in the late 1950's and at the time, it simply blew me away, and it was my hands down favorite hard core Science Fiction movie up to the release of `2001 A Space Odyssey'. And, even then, I begrudgingly pidgeonholed `2001' into its own special category to preserve the preeminant place of my beloved `Forbidden Planet'.The very first thing which sets `Forbidden Planet' off from so many other 1950's sci-fi movies is that it is clearly not simply a monster movie. Not that there are no good monster movies. Whitness `The Thing' and, of course, `King Kong', but `Forbidden Planet' was pure sci-fi, the kind which is driven by the defining characteristic of the genre. That is the proposition `What if this particular thing were true? What would follow from this (and be turned into the basis of the story)'. The fact that the story was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's `The Tempest' made absolutely no impression on me, as I didn't even realize this until long after the movie had passed into cult heaven. It was much  more impressive to me to realize that the whole idea of `Star Trek' was based on some of the `Forbidden Planet' premises.Watching this movie after almost 50 years of revering it's memory does a lot to enable a more balanced evaluation of the movie. The first thing is that while it remains one of the very best of its period and genre, it is not necessarily head and shoulders over other sci-fi movies of the same period. `The Day the Earth Stood Still' comes to mind as a critically successful movie of the time. But, aside from it's being in color, some differences between `Forbidden Planet' and `The Day...' stand out. The first is the quality of the special effects, done for M-G-M by a team from the Walt Disney studio. In the world of pre `2001' effects, `Forbidden Planet' probably outdid every other movie in special effects quality. They look ordinary by today's standards, but they were most definitely not as hokey as the run of the mill stuff in 1955. The flagship effect, of course, is Robbie the Robot who, to this day, I sneakily believe was a real machine and not a tin suit with someone inside. Even if Robbie was controlled by a human at a console at the end of a long cable, I was still impressed. Robbie set the standard for artificial intelligence on film until the Hal 9000 arrived on the scene. Another aspect of the movie which clearly set it apart from the rest of the pack is the distinctive nature of the sound track music. The credits clearly indicate that the music is synthesized and not performed on traditional string, wind, or percussion instruments. Like so many other things, this music defined sci-fi music for an entire generation.The very best thing about the movie was the sophistication of the `what if' premise. The story is that a scientific team of 20 people lands on the planet Altair 4 and 18 of the 20 are killed by a monstrous entity of pure energy created from the `id' of the team's philologist, Dr. Morbius, enhanced by the technology of the long dead natives of the planet, the Krell, who were killed by their unleashing these `monsters from the id' in their quest to attain a life of pure energy, separated from the body. Even the names `Morbius' and `Krell' have an enchantment about them which rings something in the soul of a teenager of the time.My memory of the plot of `The Tempest' is a bit rusty, but I can see the similarity in a nobleman, `Prospero' being stranded on a remote island with daughter, Miranda and their being found by a party in a passing ship. I also recall the character of Caliban, a `savage and deformed slave' according to my complete Shakespeare. The part of Caliban is played, with a major overhaul, by Robbie, of course. I can see no analogue to the facinating character of Ariel, `an airy spirit'. The adaptors of Will Shakespeare's idea should have made an effort to learn some dialogue from the bard as well as his story line.The most glaring blemish in the movie is some of the really dreadful use of words of which I am sure the script writers were proud as being examples of supplying new words for concepts of the future. Unfortunately, this dialogue grates rather than impresses. The other surface blemish is the sophmoric romantic action between the space ship Bellerophon's senior officers and daughter Altara. The behavior is so obvious and so contrived that I would have thought they could resist this easy business. But, they did not, and it does not one wit to move the story along. The rather amusing little encounter between the stereotyped ship's cook and Robbie makes a bigger contribution to the story than these romantic interests.These are merely surface defects which I have been able to overlook through several viewings over the course of my life. It has only been on this latest viewing that they stick out from the otherwise remarkable quality of the movie. The heart of the movie is the basic premise of the Krell, their fantastic power sources and machines built into the heart of the planet, their effort to free themselves from material form, and their distruction upon unleashing hidden powers from the very Freudian notion of the id, short for libido. As long as you are willing to buy into this premise, things go smoothly, but once you start thinking this through, the premise falls apart. But, this is sci-fi, after all, where time travel and faster than light travel are possible, so sit back and enjoy the ride.A tarnished jewel of a movie, one of the very few `50s sci-fi works which deserve to be watched today.	5.0	Greatest Hard Sci Fi Movie of them All, even with blemishes	2004-08-01	7	6	1

AND MADE IN 1956!I would love to see this re-released for the big screen, but while waiting forever for Warner to issue the Blu-day disc I decided instead to opt for an already available 1080p disc in HD DVD which was released in November, 2006, for the true 50th anniversary.Unless you have spent your entire life on Pandora, you probably know the story of the space ship, United Planets Cruiser C-57D, under the command of Commander J.J. Adams (a dark-haired Leslie Nielsen) sent to rescue survivors on an earlier mission to Altair IV, which is rebuffed by the sole survivor. Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), who lives with his daughter, Altaira (the beautiful Anne Francis), born on the planet, and his articulate, handyman robot, Robby. Morbius warns Adams not to land because an invisible monster eliminated all members of the earlier Bellerophon crew, and that Adams's crew could meet the same fate. Of course, Commander Adams rises to the challenge and the film begins.The film was shot entirely indoors on  M-G-M Culver City sound stages. Special effects for the landing sequence and the monster were created by an animator, Joshua Meador, on loan from Disney, and are incredible for 1956. Some matted frames (e.g., Altaira and the tiger) are a bit crude by current standards but Lucas reworked the original Star Wars a few years ago because his were not much better in 1977. The extras show deleted scenes -- crude, but amazing they exist at all -- and lots of interesting tidbits that will engage you. Robby the Robot (which cost an expensive $125.000 to build) had a career outside Forbidden Planet, particularly on the TV show The Twilight Zone, but it is documented in the extras by the film The Invisible Boy and by a The Thin Man TV episode in crystal clear black and white.The Blu-day disc, though four years late, should be as feature-filled as the HD DVD disc, and I recommend it highly.There is talk of a Forbidden Planet remake. It is truly unnecessary, much as the terrible remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still. The 1956 version stands the test of time quite well.	5.0	Ahead of its time -- by many decades	2010-08-25	3	2	1

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AJDQ5EBQNDGLF	Bob L	"It was 1977 and I was at a Kiddie's Matinee at the San Carlos Fox Theatre seeing Forbidden Planet for the umpteenth time. I was the only one in the audience over twelve. I was twenty three at the time. I sat in the upper loge by myself and down below on the floor some 300 kids seem to be bored to death by the movie. Their silence was deafening, which made Louis and Bebe Baron's incredible ""tonalities"" soundtrack all the more enthralling. I was mesmerized again for the umpteenth time.It always seemed weird to me that the movie treatment was so sophomoric in nature. Why would such a sophisticated, grandiose story be geared down for children, with it's schoolyard love story and overblown characterizations.The movie ended and the credits rolled. the screen went black. I stood up, ready to beat the unsatiated, stampeding mob to the exits when in unison some 300 kids began to clap, hoot and holler after not making a peep for the whole duration of the film. They showed their appreciation for better than 45 seconds. It became apparent that the reason they made it for kids is their capacity to understand where adults don't.Actually, what I thought was the ""gearing down"" for the kids was really for the adults who's minds tend to wander if you don't put some sort of eye-candy in front of them or yell at them once in a while to get their attention back.The story revolves around the crew of a space cruiser checking up on a colony after twenty years of being on a remote planet outpost. Before landing, they are radioed by one of the colonist, a phonologist named Morbius. He tells them that their services are not required and politely suggests they go away. The Captain of the crew, having travelled the better part of a year to get there, does not accept Morbius' wish of non-invovlement, to which Morbius then changes his message of disinterest to one of warning and one that disallows himself of any responsibility for the crew's wellbeing. They do not heed his warning and what they find boggles the mind.This is one of the five greatest Sci-Fis ever, the others being The Day the Earth Stood Still, Metropolis, Starman and 2001:A Space Odyssey and all five are part of the 100 greastest films ever made. Forbidden Planet is the ultimate story of all time and the probable fate of man. That's if were lucky enough to survive as long as the Krell (I always thought it would be spelled Crel but so many have it spelt Krell I figure they must have read it from some authorative source).Parents should encourage their local movie theaters to go back to the practice of Kiddie Matinees and exhibit revivals of classic kids fare. The kind of films that don't go for cheap laughs with bodily function jokes but are thought provoking and enlightening while being entertaining. There are enough of these films to show a triple bill every week of the summer and not repeat for a hundred years."	5.0	Call it a premonition	2004-10-08	9	9	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3EW2L59UBHQSG	Bruce Aguilar	Forbidden Planet is an incredible movie and no Sci-Fi fan should be without it.  The transfer on the 50th Anniversary and Ultimate Collector's  Editions is incredible.  I've never seen the film look so bright, crisp and vibrant.  The included documentaries and bonus footage are very entertaining and not to be missed.A word of warning though, the Ultimate Collector's Edition is a bit of a rip off.  The included Robby the Robot toy was the main reason I bought this set and it's much smaller (and less detailed) than the images lead you to believe.  I haven't opened mine, but it looks like it's not even articulated.  Definitely not worth the extra money I had to pay.  The lobby card reporductions are nice, as is the tin case, but unless you plan to display these it's hard to justify the added cost.Be smart, skip the Ultimate Collector's Edition and buy the 50th Anniversary Edition.  You'll get just the exact same transfer and bonus material without the cheap toy and lobby cards.	5.0	Stay Away from the Ultimate Edition	2006-11-28	340	313	27
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A5F2G8DWBPAP7	bruce anderson	It's already established fact that Forbidden Planet is one of the best movies of its kind, introducing the concept of hyper drive, and measuring space travel time in parsecs. The monsters from the id idea is strongly parallel to the Biblical truth that human nature is corrupted by sin, which can only be conquered through death, therefore the true cause of death is moral. The movie closes with the statement that man is not God, in a context that demonstrates that technology cannot remove evil from human nature. Christ Himself taught that the human heart is the source of all evil in the world. I found the bonus movie, The Invisible Boy to be most entertaining,especially the end, and the discussion of Science Fiction films featuring George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, and Ridley Scott, narrated by Mark Hamill, to be quite good as well.	5.0	Beyond expectations	2013-07-10	1	1	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1GB0HW46Y2EB	Bruce G. Taylor	"I saw this picture when it was first released to theaters in glorious CinemaScope and stereophonic sound and at the time it was impressive indeed.  As time when on though, a few things about it bothered me a little:The appearance of the ""Id monster"" has a definite animated look, as indeed it was as provided by one of the Disney animators on loan-out to MGM.  The animated ray under the landing spaceship from Earth also doesn't look believable.Morbius points to the three-cornered opening as a ""characteristic arch"" of the Krell.  Those sharp corners would be seen immediately as stress concentrations by any engineer worth his salt going right back to the ancient Romans.  Obviously intended as something that would ""look different"".  Britain's first jet-liner, the de Havilland Comet had sharp cornered windows which caused the fuselage to crack and go to pieces in mid-flight and that was the end of that model.When Morbius demonstrates the recording made by Krell musicians thousands of years ago, it sounds exactly the same as the electronic tonalities we've been hearing all through the picture, so it doesn't have the impact it should.When Morbius has the Captain (Leslie Nielsen) fire his ray gun to test the strength of the Krell door,  Nielsen fires and then walks up to the door and comments that ""this spot should be molten"".  But he is pointing to a spot more than a foot away from where his ray supposedly struck it.Actually I like this picture a lot and these quibbles are mainly in fun.  For its time it was the Cadillac of science-fiction films - somethiing you would expect from MGM.  I""ll probably want to see the Blu-ray, but I'm afraid the landscapes of the planet Altair 4 will look more than ever like painted backdrops.p.s.  Well, the Blu-ray version of this classic did finally show up and I bought it and I'm very pleased with the upgrade-- especially the improvement in audio.  Filmed in CinemaScope, it had three channel stereophonic sound which is faithfully rendered in the Blu-ray version.  The video quality (as I predicted above) does show the details of where the sets end and the painted backdrops begin -- similar the the Blu-ray version of  ""The Wizard of Oz.""  Even so I would never forgo the overall improvements of the Blu-ray version to the previous DVD."	5.0	A Worthy Edition Until the Blu-ray Shows Up	2009-12-19	2	0	2
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1HG2DOSBZEX4I	Bryan A. Pfleeger	In 1956 MGM released Fred Wilcox's Forbidden Planet. Originally conceived as a B-movie the film has taken on a personality and a cult status that brands it as one of the most unique American films made. The film has been the inspiration for Star Wars and Star Trek and just about every modern space opera references it.The story is not a simple one and a great deal of Cyril Hume's screenplay is exposition that manages to take somewhat complex themes and make them accessible to a Saturday afternoon audience. A space cruiser piloted by Commander J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen) lands on the planet Altair 4 and meets the mysterious  Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira ( Anne Francis). Morbius is studying the artifacts of a strange civilization called the Krells. The Krell civilization was incredibily advanced. It had wiped out war, disease and had explored the universe 2000 centuries ago before it was itself wiped out.The story is a reworking of Shakespeare's The Tempest and the story hold up quite well after 52 years. The special effects were amazing for the time period and the matte paintings used for the backgrounds still look fantastic. The film was nominated for the 1957 Oscar for best special effects.If there is a problem with Forbidden Planet it is that the story of Monsters of the Id is somewhat dated. The film needs to be seen for the special effects production that it was. It does not need to be analysed for its story telling ability.The edition I viewed was the single disc  released by Warner Brothers. There have been at least two editions released since mine came out and I understand are much more complete. The picture, while not perfect, is quite good. There are scratches and abundant markings for reel changes and the like but they do not really mar the viewing experience. The sound is a standard mono mix but is easy to understand. The disc does not feature any special features other than the trailer. The trailer features a floating yellow scroll that was duplicated to great effect in the Star Wars movies.Get yourself some popcorn pop this one in and enjoy the golden age of sci-fi moviemaking.	4.0	One of the Most Influential Films Ever Made	2008-12-03	1	0	1

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A22IK3I6U76GX0	Calle	I wish I had got the chance to see this movie in a theatre. The special effects are fantastic, and remember this movie was made in the 1950s. I am sure George Lucas got some inspiration from this movie.`Forbidden Planet' has a great story, wonderful scenery, great special effects, and a good cast. Leslie Nielsen makes a good feature film debut (it's interesting to see his early, more serious roles). The history of the planet, with the ancient civilization, is very fascinating and the music is haunting. This was the first movie to have a soundtrack made entirely by electronic instruments. This movie inspired not only George Lucas; I actually read a Donald Duck adventure, some years ago, with almost exactly the same story. Also `Alien 3' has some similarities in the story about the beautiful woman who, without wanting to, gets the men (who haven't seen a woman for years) to start arguing.I saw this movie for the first time today and it is now on the list of my favorite movies. Somebody said it was a little too slow, but I don't think it is. I can almost promise that you will never regret buying this movie. I think you will watch it over and over again.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2BC9TW5GO4XJR	Celia DLF	Perhaps one of the greatest science fiction films of the 1950s, after The Day the Earth Stood Still and The Thing from Another World.  The special effects, color, the sets and even the matte paintings are magnificent. The iconic Robbie the Robot is great and at times a hoot.  The story is great, though a bit cerebral for lovers of B films. I would not call this a B film.  I can see where the idea for the original Star Trek might have come from this movie.  My only gripe is that I wish cover art was the original poster.  This DVD release also includes The Invisible Boy, a minor black and white B sci-fi film that has the distinction of having Robbie the Robot in it.  Highly recommended.	5.0	Forbidden Planet	2013-09-20	0	0	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A18UECGGBKUOZF	Chari Krishnan	What a Soundtrack!  What a screenplay!  What fantastic voices of Walter Pidgeon, Leslie Neilsen, and Robby the Robot!Terrific acting by fit,  goodlooking actors!  And Anne Francis--a blonde beauty with a mole on her  face!--as Leslie Neilsen says in the movie when she's coming out of the  water after a swim, &quot;Holy murder!&quot;  Look out, Cindy Crawford!It's been over 30 years since I barely caught the tail end of this movie  on a black and white tv set in Philadelphia, and it's still the best movie  I've ever seen!  And it's one of only 3 movies I love to watch again and  again!Here are the basics:  the producers and creative team took  Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest,&quot; moved the story to the year 2200  A.D., created a soundtrack called &quot;electronic tonalities,&quot; cast  Walter Pidgeon--a veteran of over 100 movies-- and turned him into a mad  scientist, gave Leslie Neilsen a chance to show what a terrific, well  rounded leading man he is, made Anne Francis a fabulous scientist's  daughter, and threw in super character actors Warren Stevens, Jack Kelly  (&quot;Maverick&quot;), Richard Anderson (&quot;The Six Million Dollar  Man&quot;), and Earl Holliman (&quot;Police Woman&quot;), and invented the  most eloquent, talented, and likable robot ever to grace the screen,  and  mixed science fiction, a love story, and a murder mystery on a planet light  years away from Earth!Walter Pidgeon is Morbius, the sole survivor  of an Earth expedition years before, a philologist who is living alone on  Altair 4 with Altaira (Anne Francis), his young sexy daughter, and a robot,  Robby, who speaks &quot;187 languages and a variety of subtongues,&quot;  when Commander J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen) and his crew arrive from Earth  in the C-57D, a flying saucer.The saucer lands, and Nielsen and his  crew soon learn that Pidgeon's colleagues were all murdered, as he tells  them, &quot;torn literally limb from limb by soem mysterious force that  never once showed itself.&quot;  Leslie Nielsen plays his role very much  like Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer, tough but fair, a ladies man, and  carefully adding up the clues to gradually find the killer.&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; is a beautiful movie, a textbook on how a  movie should be made: have actors who look the part and who have good  voices, write a great script, and use terrific music, props, and special  effects.  And throw in the old &quot;Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy  gets Girl theme!&quot;(And it's obvious that Gene Roddenberry spent  a LOT of time watching this movie because &quot;Star Trek&quot; is an  obvious &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; ripoff! )&quot;Forbidden  Planet&quot; is better than &quot;Star Wars&quot; because it's more mature,  better than &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; because it deals with the  future, not the past, and better than &quot;Titanic&quot; because Leslie  Nielsen is a leading man both in Romance and in Action--you just know he's  going to find a way to win his leading lady, and not lose her forever, like  Leonardo DiCaprio did in &quot;Titanic!&quot;But the best way to  describe &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; is to quote Leslie Nielsen's final  line in the movie, &quot;It will remind us... after all...that we are not  God...&quot;Chari Krishnan  Tango2200@Hotmail.Com	5.0	&quot;It will remind  us ...after all... that we are not God...&quot;	2000-09-20	19	17	2

Tonight, I just watched it again, on Turner Classics, which prompted me to check on my past review, and now update it with the DVD comments.Basically, it just keeps getting better. If you haven't seen it. Get It! Simply my favorite movie. Period. Better on DVD now with both standard TV and Widescreen on 2 sides. As to my first review, here is a reprint, to save you from wasting time searching for it. At this time 20 out of 23 people found it helpful.10 Stars! Simply one of the BEST SciFi Movies Ever Made!, July 23, 1997 Reviewer: A viewerOOOhhhh! Fliping through the channels...surfing the cable and ...WOW! What is this? Cool! C57D, a flying saucer with, YES it's Leslie Nielsen as ever-so-serious Captain.Forbidden Planet, was MGM's high-budget, risky venture at making the one of the finest Color Sci-Fi classics in the 50's. Unlike many of the low budget movies of the genre, FP remains to this day a very entertaining and captivating film. I have to say, that it changed my life as a kid, because it gave me the desire to explore more books about Sci-Fi. Now, I am a Software Engineer with thousands of video tapes. Monster movies are my favorites, and speaking of monsters, the one in FP is on the top of my list of BEST MONSTERS (those you really don't want to ever meet in a dark...even a well lit alley).The story: Based on a screenplay by Irving Block and Allen Adler (Fatal Planet), it takes its inspiration from Shakespears's THE TEMPEST. In a nutshell, Spacemen come to rescue a lost group of colonists, only to find that most have died long ago. Only Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) remain. They tell Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen) that 20 years ago, when they first landed, some invisible power killed everyone but Dr.Morbius and his wife (now deceased from natural causes). Soon, we find that the good Doctor has discovered that the KRELL, a once powerful race of aliens, lived below the surface of Altair-4 (where they are) and they created a machine that is 20x20x20 miles square (thats 8000 cubic miles of Klystrons and Relays...and they never stop self repairing themselves!). Well, before you know it, the Monster is back...and people are dying...and well, the big, bad disintigrator beams from the ship's main weapons are NOT stopping it!I must mention that this was the first movie with ROBBY THE ROBOT. ROBBY was based on Asimov's Robots Rules of order, and for the most part was just a big lovable teady-bear. He could never hurt anyone, but watch how Morbius proves this by having Robby point a &quot;BLASTER&quot; at the Commander! The way Nielsen clinches his fists was so telling!.The sets were beautiful, the saucer flys perfectly (notice the shadows and the dust when it lands). So much here that you simply must watch very closely to the detail, it really is worth it. Speaking of detail, the Monster was pretty easy...because it was MOSTLY invisible. Joshua Meador (on loan from Disney Studios) made the animation of the monster. It is crude by comparison to the new Computer Generated Animation (CGA), but for its time it was AWESOME! The monster, by the way, is powered by 2700 thermo-nuclear reactors, and can recreate itself, microsecond after microsecond! NO! IT CANNOT BE DESTROYED! (You thought ALIENS were tough! HAH!)Well, there is a little love story going on with the Commander and Altaira, and Daddy doesn't like it. Go Figure! Anyway, I won't give it all away, just GET IT AND ENJOY!...

Some of it looks a little cheesy now (but then look at Star Trek TOS) and anyone under about 30 will probably need to ask parents or grandparents why Ann Francis's costumes and behavior were just this side of scandalous.

To my disappointment, there wasn't a commentary track.  Wouldn't it have been great to hear running comments from Anne Francis and Leslie Nielson alone?  Lacking that, a more comprehensive set of interviews with the actors, most of whom are still alive would have been appreciated.While I find ""The Invisible Boy"" a nice addition, I'd have preferred more data on the making of the film.  The included documentaries skim the surface of the making of the films.  Nice, but more could have been better.  The figure included is a fun item but awfully small and I feel the overall package is missing something that could have made it a truly great five-star package."	4.0	Great But Still A Disappointment	2007-01-09	2	1	1

Very well crafted, the full color tin beckons you to the excitement within.  As a collector, you'll be pleased with the Robby die-cast miniature (personally, I've left mine behind the cellophane packaging, but that's a personal call).  The artistic lobby card miniatures are another welcome bonus - and very nicely produced, too.  (And the mail-in order form for an original-size theatre poster for a few bucks can't be beat - get it.)  Upon arrival, I was overjoyed with the beautiful tin and overall product packaging.  With respect to content - this one has it all.  I'd never viewed the Thin Man episode ""Robot Client"" before now, and also didn't own a copy of The Invisible Boy - two very essential genre-related works that are a welcome edition to the package.  The collection of deleted and ""lost"" scenes make up the better part of an additional half hour of original movie content and SFX test footage.  My only complaint is I seem to remember an edited-out scene included on the original Criterion Collection laserdisc (I don't own one) of a ship-board wedding between Nielsen and Francis which is still missing here.  Content-wise, this 2 disc collection lives up to its reputation, and is jammed packed with hours and hours of bonus material - I won't list them here: read the official Editorial Reviews above!  As far as quality is concerned, I've never seen a cleaner print: clearly digitally restored, as clear and ""scratch-free"" as they come.  The audio is stunning - you'll enjoy the Barron's electronic ""tonalities"" score as never before with a fully re-mastered Dolby Digital 5.1 surround presentation.  Bottom line: get this version if you have no budgetary constraints.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A38IF6ZZ14MVT	ClareW	Forbidden Planet is one of my all time favourite Sci Fi movies, so I was very excited at the prospect of being able to view it in Blu-ray with a DTS soundtrack. However, I must confess that I was a little disappointed. Although the image quality is noticeably better than the standard NTSC DVD version, it wasn't quite as crisp and sharp as I had hoped for. I think this is largely due to the graininess of the original film stock. I have noticed the same thing with the blu-ray transfers of other older films including Ghandi.I was also hoping that the soundtrack had been digitally remastered to provide a surround sound experience, but found that this was not the case. To be honest, the DTS soundtrack does sound better than the original DVD version, but it would have been nice to listen to it in 5.1. They were able to do it for 2001, so I was hoping they could do it for this too. I found it difficult to find a truly satisfactory surround sound stage for it on my home theatre system and ended up listening to it in stereo. I found this the most disappointing aspect of this version.I haven't yet had a look at the bonus features and do believe that the disc is probably worth buying for these alone, but have to advise you not to expect the same sort of movie experience we are accustomed to getting with more recent releases. Still a great show though and definitely superior to the standard DVD - particularly on larger screen TVs!	3.0	Not quite what I was expecting	2010-11-23	10	8	2

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A6YJXMMWFZR5P	Clyde A. Dodge	I first saw much of this film, but not all of it, when it first came out. I was at a special appearance by a local TV figure who had a daily show directed at very young children. His name was Captain Satellite and he was appearing live at the local theater downtown. So I went to see him, and they showed this movie. I was 4 years old.I was OK, but apprehensive, until the scene when the invisible monster enters the spacecraft, and you can see the steps bending under the monster's weight. The next thing I knew I was in hysterics in the lobby, and an usher and my mother were trying to calm me down. It was such a potent nightmare for a young child. I finally went back in to the theater, but my mother sat with me, and held her hands over my eyes when I asked her to. I didn't see much of the attack on the spacecraft when the monster tries to come through the force field, but I sure heard it.I finally saw this again on TV in my teens, and I loved it. It is such an unusual piece of work that much if it gets right past the filters we install to protect us from whatever frightens us in the movies and goes straight for the id, if you know what I mean.What keeps it from being a five star movie is the somewhat hokey, tired humor associated with the cook and Robby, and Anne Francis's limitations as an actress.Walter Pidgeon is a wonder. His inner struggle to protect his daughter becomes the crux of the film and the energy that drives the monster on the loose.There is something so wonderfully eerie about the entire production design. Some of the spookiest, unnerving scenes take place when the crew is being escorted through the subterannean machinery built by the previous inhabitants of the planet.And the music. Wow. There has never been anything like it since. The electronic score was very much in the style of pieces being pioneered by artists such as Morton Subotnik during this era. This, most of all in the film, is what gets under your skin, disarms you, and leaves you open to the powerful images and themes that the film conveys.This is a must see for anyone who is any kind of sci-fi fan. I think it would rank high on the list of any fan of fantasy or horror in cinema as well. As for being scared, I was never scared so badly at a film again until I saw Alien. I think that is another film that owes a debt to Forbidden Planet.	4.0	Scared the Living Daylights Out of Me	2006-11-14	0	0	0

Check the ship as they go to drop out of hyper-drive. The Captain says, ""Stations everyone."" The chief calls out, ""You want to bounce through this one?"" It's the birth of the idea for Star Trek's transporter, just used in a different manner. It was so far ahead of it's time for the sci-fi genre. I watch it all the time & don't you love the soundtrack? It's still one of the best monster concepts ever. Does anyone want to meet their Id?The Krell machine. 8000 cubic miles of self-maintaining physics & mechanics. Professor Morbius says, ""Look in the mirror gentlemen, man does not behold the face of the Gorgon & live.""This was back in 1956, remember TRON another movie way ahead of it's time. There can be no doubt that Forbidden Planet's Krell machine was the inspiration for the world of Tron. Look at the images of them walking from one of the 400 shafts to the place they view the energy source.It is almost a twin to the shot of the individual tanks chasing the light cycles after they break out of the game grid. I will never love another Sci-Fi like I do this. It all works so very well & is expressed as a complete thought.I own it on both DVD & Laser Disc & always struggle to decide which to put on. Yes the DVD is higher def but the Laser Disc has a luminosity to the colors that is more ethereal than the DVD.

Rather than bore the reader, let me just suffice to say that the viewer of ""Forbidden Planet"" is truly in for a treat.  The unusual tonal sound quality, great matte painting, wonderful (for the time) special effects, introduction of Robbie the Robot, and a great cast including Leslie Neilsen (as a serious actor) Walter Pidgeon, beautiful Anne Francis, Warren Stevens, and Earl Holliman make this a great film for all science fiction fans.In this humble reviewer's opinion, ""Forbidden Planet"" ranks with the great of this era which included, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", ""Them"", ""The Thing"", and ""War of the Worlds"".  If you are a collector of the science fiction films of this era, then ""Forbidden Planet"" MUST find a place on your shelf.The transfer of the film to DVD is very solid.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A25ZVI6RH1KA5L	"cookieman108 ""cookieman108"""	It's funny, me being a fan of science fiction and movies in general, why it is that it took me so long to get around to watching Forbidden Planet (1956).  Part of it is I feel as if I've already seen the film, as clips from it are usually always shown whenever someone does a documentary on science fiction in film, as it's just such an influential and amazing piece of work.  Now, I've heard that this movie is loosely based on Shakespeare's play, The Tempest, but since I've never read it, I can't comment on comparisons between the play and the film.  The film stars Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, Leslie Nielsen, and Robby the Robot (Yes, the robot gets a screen credit.  If you look on the Internet Movie Database, you'll find it's even listed as an actor).The story is about a spacecraft sent to learn what exactly happened to a previous spacecraft and its' crew, which had been deployed many years prior, and has since not been heard from in some time.  This current mission is under the command of Commander John J. Adams (Nielsen), and soon find themselves on approach to the destination planet of the now lost ship.  On their arrival, they get an ominous message, from the planet, issued by a member of the original crew, Dr. Edward Morbius (Pidgeon).  Despite his warnings, they land and are soon met by a robot named Robby, who escorts them to Morbius' rather posh abode.  Here we learn all the members of that fated crew have been killed off, except for Morbius and his daughter (whom Morbius had when he procreated with another member of the original crew), Altaira (Francis), by some unseen, yet completely nasty, force, to which Morbius and his daughter seem immune.  Not expecting to find any survivors, Commander Adams now has to change his plans to include trying to contact his superiors and receive further instructions on how to proceed, despite Morbuis' protests that they should leave as soon as possible, leaving him and his daughter behind so that he may continue his research.  What is his research?  Well, it seems that many hundreds of thousands of years ago, the planet was inhabited by a highly advanced race of being called the Krell, who mysteriously vanished seemingly overnight in comparison to their collective power, intelligence and abilities, and while their cities have long since gone, a great deal of their technology survived underneath the ground, and Morbius has managed to gain some understanding of these beings, even being able to pry bits of information and such in the 20 odd years that he's been here.  This amazing discovery is certainly worth writing home about, and so Commander Adams begins having the men disassemble the ship to create a device powerful enough to send a message back to his superiors, and in the meantime, starts making time with Morbius' daughter, who's never seen a man outside of her father, and is uneducated in the ways of woo.  Things seem to be progressing until an unseen late night attack on the ship damages some crucial elements needed for communication, so an electrified perimeter is set up to prevent the approach of any more unannounced and unwelcome visitors.  We soon find out the fence works, as a huge beastie, normally invisible, now highlighted by the electrical current, tries to attack the ship, killing a few defenders.  What exactly is the nature of this beast?  Is it somehow connected to the Krell?  Does Morbius know more than he's letting on?  Will any get off this planet alive?  What the heck were these Krell up to anyway?Forbidden Planet is inspirational, in my opinion, because it presents an well developed and thought out story above and beyond the usual `scary alien' fare we saw in the early 50's.  Similar to The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), it brought a level of intelligence to the genre while managing to also entertain.  Basically, whatever level you view the film on, it will provide enjoyment.  It also hallmarked the first film appearance of Robby the Robot, probably one of the most popular, recognizable, and enduring icons in science fiction film history.  Also, it is important to note, this is the first film to utilize an entirely electronically composed musical score.  Stereotypical characterizations appear to create the various roles, but since the film was releases a good 14 years before I was even born, I can't help but wonder if the stereotypes started here, given the influence of the film.  The production value overall is lavish and indicates little expense was spared in bringing the story to life.  The special effects, even by today's standards, look remarkably good, and the realism in the matte painting backgrounds is truly spectacular.  The tour of the huge underground Krell facility really stood out in my mind, properly highlighting the enormity and intricacies at the same time.  Plot holes?  Yeah, I noticed a few of them (like how'd Robby show up at the end despite every circuit being blown?  And that self-destruct mechanism at the end...that seemed a bit convenient and lacking proper safeguards one would normally apply as to not accidentally cause it to go off), but these tend to pale in comparison to the overall film.  As a whole, I think anyone would be hard pressed not to acknowledge this as one of the more influential films in the genre, and just a lot of fun in general.Warner Brother's gets points from providing an excellent widescreen print (the DVD is double sided, with fullscreen on the flipside), but loses some in their complete lack of special features other than an original theatrical trailer.  I find it pretty sad that this film doesn't rate the special features we so often see on new releases.  Normally I'd be happy with a good looking print, but surely certain films deserve some preferential treatment, and this, in my opinion, is one of them.  Oh well...Cookieman108	5.0	My evil self is at the door, and I have no power to stop it.	2004-06-14	285	249	36
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3SFO2GSP5CVSM	"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom"""	When one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of schlocky black and white B films that were parodied on the old Mystery Science Theater 3000 television show. Yet, while there were far more films like Plan 9 From Outer Space and Robot Monster than good films, the 1950s did have some very good, if not great, science fiction films like The Day The Earth Stood Still, The Incredible Shrinking Man, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, War Of The Worlds, and The Thing From Another World. Yet, the best of the bunch, for its literacy and production values, was undoubtedly MGM's first big foray into A level science fiction, Forbidden Planet, released in 1956. It was a 98 minute color film, directed by Fred M. Wilcox, that featured then state of the art special effects, and was endowed with a very good screenplay by Cyril Hume, from a screen treatment called Fatal Planet, by Irving Block and Allen Adler, who adapted aspects of William Shakespeare's The Tempest into it.The film drew raves when it was released, for its Oscar nominated special effects, its all electronic music score, by Louis and Bebe Barron (although credited as Electronic Tonalities, to avoid music guild fees), vivid matte paintings- inspired by Chesley Bonestell, and the famed Monster Of The Id (MOTI), which was animated by an animator, Joshua Meador, on loan from the Walt Disney studio. Even more famous was the appearance of Robby The Robot, in his first role in either film or television. Later he would appear in the film The Invisible Boy- included in this DVD as a bonus, as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi tv shows The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, and Lost In Space- with whose own robot he is often confused, and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film Gremlins.The tale is simple, but elegantly constructed, and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced `love story' aspect in the film. In the 23rd Century, the United Planets Cruiser C-57D- a flying saucer, led by Commander J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen- yes he was once a leading man type before his Police Squad days), is en route to the planet Altair IV, to investigate what happened to the crew of the Bellerophon, sent to the planet twenty years earlier. After a year's journey, there they encounter the lone survivor of the party, Doctor Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), the Prospero stand-in- a philologist, his gorgeous blond daughter Altaira (Anne Francis)- the Miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt, and Robby the Robot, the domestic servant who is the Calibanian counterpart. Morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the Bellerophon party in their first year, yet he was immune to it.... All in all, it's a technically good film- especially with some rear projections and matte paintings, and the absurdity of the adult reactions to Timmy's and Robby's exploits borders an Dalian surreal absurdity. Yet, it's manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures, for it's played straight, thus making it even funnier. As for the main feature? Forbidden Planet deserves all its kudos. It's not a perfect film, but it's a great way to spend a couple of hours, and far better than Star Wars, which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated, and juvenile. Only such films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris, Alien and Aliens, and the first two Terminator films, have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects.It's worth knowing that, despite Forbidden Planet's `happy ending', there is the possibility that the MOTI is still dormant within Alta, as well. After all, she is her father's daughter, and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the MOTI attacked the ship a second time. Also, the film wisely only `shows' the MOTI once, and never shows the Krel, for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects. The film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale, something that far more realistic art films often fail to do. Forbidden Planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era- unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious Cold War allegories. Watch it, and you will agree, as well as sleep a little less easy. But, even if you don't, there's still the scene of Anne Francis skinnydipping. That alone is timeless.	4.0	Top notch	2008-09-11	0	0	0

If you are at least passingly aware of this movie, you cannot but already know it's legendary status and importance and quality.This DVD had some great extras.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2S5LC0VIMSM4X	Darcy James Morris	Sure, it benefits from the &#34;Tempest&#34;-derived story line, and Walter Pidgeon is hard to top as the reclusive genius in charge of powerful and ultimately destructive technology, but this tale of danger and redemption stands up surprisingly well some six decades later.The special effects showcase some clever animation and matte paintings, and are blended with some thought to the idea of &#34;less is more,&#34; which helps in the suspension of disbelief in most scenes (aside from the unfortunate &#34;pop-gun&#34; blaster effects).  The sound effects are appropriately futuristic, and push the envelope of what analog could do for that period of time in Hollywood.  Aside from the inevitable comic relief character in the form of the ship's cook, and a laughable misuse of the term &#34;Quantum Mechanic,&#34; the pace, acting, and conceptualizations are on par with Sci-Fi films half its age.This film spawned all manner of imitation, and even served as part of the inspiration for Gene Roddenberry's &#34;Star Trek,&#34; so it might seem very familiar to even first-time viewers.  But, for sheer entertainment, this film is at the head of the pack for 50's science fiction.  Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the journey to Altair iV.	5.0	One of the best of classic 50's Sci-Fi	2014-02-13	0	0	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2H3I51PU90XA4	datarush	One of my all-time favorite sci-fi flicks, I was one of those kids that saw Forbidden Planet in the drive-in back in the 50's. Drive-ins were the big deal at the time and first run movies played at them not just the B grade of later years. I was also one of those kids that hid under the seat when the monster 'appeared'. OK I was a chicken. Forbidden Planet has held up amazingly well over the years. MGM gave it a big budget with the best technical staff who got their ideas onto the sets. It remains a very innovative movie, presaging much of what was to come in cinema and the real world. It did miss the move to digital, at least in the 'physicality' of the technology. Perhaps the Krell were so advanced they could hide the digital element with a visually more appealing analog representation of their technology. Anyway its a great movie that should be seen by EVERYONE!	5.0	As good as it gets	2008-02-13	2	1	1
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AWLFVCT9128JV	"Dave_42 ""Dave_42"""	"""Forbidden Planet"" is one of the most influential science fiction movies of all time.  Unlike many of its contemporaries, the special effects are at least reasonable even today.  While so many science fiction movies relied on stories of alien races and monsters, this movie uses that type of story to complement what is a surprisingly good science fiction story.  This filmed debuted on March 15th of 1956 in the U.S., and subsequently became a classic of the genre.  It is pretty much impossible to watch a retrospective on science fiction movies without seeing scenes from this movie included.This film introduced the world to Robby the Robot, and featured Walter Pidgeon as Doctor Edward Morbius, Anne Francis as his Altaira, Dr. Morbius' daughter, and Leslie Nielsen as Commander Adams.  It is a little odd seeing Leslie Nielsen in a serious role after all the comedies that he has done in the later part of his career, but he does a decent enough job.  You will likely recognize some of the other actors in this movie as well, such as Warren Stevens and Richard Anderson.  The story involves the ship's personnel learning about the horrible fate of the other colonists, followed by the crew facing the same horrible force.  The story combines action with a more thoughtful story, which undoubtedly has more to do with this movie becoming a classic than anything else.While overall it is a good science fiction story, they do make some ridiculous scientific choices along the way.  The spaceship design is very questionable, with three staircases for exit or entry and no airlocks.  There is also the absurdity of needing to take the ship apart in order to contact their base when things turn out to be different than what they expected.  Those things only detract a little from the overall movie though, and when compared with most of its contemporaries they are very small problems.  The story also mixes is some humor more so than some of the other films.  Earl Holliman as the cook offers some humorous moments in his attempts to get Robbie to produce Bourbon, and then there is my favorite exchange between Altaira and Robbie:Altaira: ""Robbie, I must have a new dress, right away.""Robbie:  ""Again?""Those who know Star Trek, particularly the original series will find themselves on familiar ground in this movie, as it clearly had a huge influence on the show.  From the premise of a United Planets Cruiser, to some of the design in the ships, to the similarity in storyline with several of the episodes, there can be no doubt that this movie had a big impact on Gene Roddenberry.  You will find plot elements of this movie in the pilot episode ""The Cage"", as well as ""What Are Little Girls Made Of"", and ""Requiem for Methuselah"".  Other episodes of Star Trek, as well as other series, may well have taken other ideas from this movie as well.The DVD is fairly bare bones, but it does offer standard and widescreen versions of the movie, one on each side.  Other than that, the only extras are the theatrical trailer and language choices.  Don't let the lack of extras deter you though, this is one worth watching."	4.0	Forbidden To Miss	2006-07-24	7	6	1

The restoration is gorgeous.  I think there may be an even larger screen ratio to come; but, until that day, this package certainly satisfies.  A friend who is a gifted actor/musician and who had never seen &#34;Forbidden Planet&#34; dropped by one day and I played the DVD just to show him the spaceship landing -- He couldn't pull himself away so he watched to whole movie.  He dropped by a few weeks later and asked to see the spaceship landing one more time -- The same thing happened -- He couldn't pull himself away and again became glued to the screen.  Like other classics such as the 1930s &#34;King Kong&#34;, this 1950s film has an inexplicable magic that results from the sum of all its parts.  I would love to see a faithful modern remake of this film, but I doubt if anyone could duplicate the magic of the original. The film-score is also unique in the sense that it is both the music and the sound effects.  All in all, the 50th anniversary edition of &#34;Forbidden Planet&#34; is a winner!  dcb	5.0	Sci Fi Classic never ceases to amaze!	2014-02-28	0	0	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AI9STF7QHFDGV	"David Coy ""Author of the Dominant Species Series"""	"Forbidden Planet uses (what was at the time) the fairly fresh concept of the id and the subconscious mind described by Freud and weaves a magical story around it in the context of an advanced, but unfortunate alien race, the Krell, undone by a technology meant to manifest thought into matter. But heck, that's just the storyline. There's much more: a whiskey synthesizing robot; Krell metal, Krell music; monsters and blasters; Leslie Nielsen as Captain Kirk's role model; sexual tension; great special effects; lots of great Theremin music; Walter Pigeon's incredible voice -- and shot in Technicolor, it's just gorgeous besides. If I had to pick just one film to wear the tasseled fez of ""the classic SF film"", this would be it.  I would have loved to have seen this film as a kid on the big screen on some hot Saturday afternoon, a thing of popcorn and a box of Junior Mints on my lap. Pure Heaven.  The film has very high production values and the art direction and the special effects alone could (almost) carry it. But the story is a conceptual masterpiece as well. It's the idea that our primitive brain, our id in the Freudian lexicon, is the entity in true control of our behavior, and if fed with enough juice can become an unstoppable destructive force, melting its way through exactly 36 inches of immutable Krell metal to tear and kill. SF doesn't get much better. There's no telling how much SF that followed it was inspired or influenced by this wonderful film."	4.0	Classic sci-fi infused with deep thought	2007-04-24	8	6	2

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AJH4L52CIUC4M	David	This movie holds up very well for it's age.  The story is one of the best of any sci fi movie ever made.  It is not a shoot em up film with lasers and wild dogfights that defy the laws of physics ( I enjoy those too!), but rather one of the most thought provoking stories ever put to screen.Another interesting point is that this film clearly inspired &#34;Star Trek&#34;.  You can easily imagine this taking place in the Star Trek universe about 50 years before the original TV series took place.  The premise of a &#34;Space Command&#34; and a ship on patrol checking settlements spread around the stars is familiar....A few of the gems here include an extremely young Leslie Neilson who reminds us that he was a very good dramatic actor before the &#34;Airplane&#34; and &#34;Police Squad&#34; comedies.  Robby the Robot is as iconic as R2-D2 and C-3PO and left young boys and girls wondering what they would do with such a futuristic piece of technology.Finally, the story of an alien race millions of years more advanced than mankind and what it says about them and us.  You just have to see it as it would be criminal to spoil such a thought provoking story.	5.0	Classic Top Ten Sci Fi movie!	2014-01-11	1	0	1
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2OVUDBRWGX0LL	David	This is one of those movies that I love to watch over and over again.  There's just something about the movie that draws me to it.  The acting, for the most part, is laughable.  Leslie Nielsen--back when he was still doing serious roles (how old is that guy?)--is particularly funny when trying to look his most serious.  Just check out the expression on Nielsen's face when Morbius tells Nielsen of his premonition of death.  You also have a young Richard &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; Anderson as the chief engineer and an equally youthful Earl &quot;Police Woman&quot; Holliman as the burbon-guzzling cook.Walter Pigeon, in the role of Dr. Edward Morbius, a marooned scientist who has developed a god complex, is probably the only actor who plays his character to a high level of credibility.  Rounding out the major players is Anne Francis, who plays Altaira, Morbius's &quot;come hither&quot; daughter.Francis, too, gave me cause to laugh in this movie.  She starts out as a 20-something, naive nature lover who's never kissed a man and, in the space of a couple of days, turns into a deliberately passionate woman who throws herself into the arms of Neilsen and spouts off lines like: &quot;I'm ready to go with you, darling.&quot;  Pretty funny stuff.Now, I don't want you to think I'm trying to trash the movie.  The story is excellent, although it was regarded as being too cerebral at the time of its release (with it's talk of &quot;the Id&quot;).  Mindful of their viewing audience at the drive-ins of the day, moviemakers eventually placed emphasis on Robbie the Robot--Morbius's mechanical helper who can balance ten tons of metal shielding in the palm of one hand (and not tip over or sink into the ground!).The story isn't all that complicated.  A ship is sent to check on another ship that landed on the planet Altair 4 years earlier.  They arrive to find everybody dead except Morbius and his daughter.  Nielsen wants to evacuate the two, but Morbius has found the remnants of an now-perished civilization called the Krell and doesn't want to leave.  Using their technology, he is able to harness the power of the mind and create anything from the nothing with a mere thought.  But there's one problem--everybody has dreams and nighmares when they sleep.  Hence, the cause of the demise of the Krell.I won't give away the ending--I've probably given away too much already.  The movie's special effects were considered cutting-edge at the time and hold up surprisingly well.  And Robbie was probably the forerunner of robot designs to come for the next decade or so.  Amusingly, you can find set pieces, and even the uniforms the crew wears, being used in quite few other movies of the period.Overall, highly recommended.	5.0	Good Clean Fun	2004-02-14	6	3	3

A Blu-ray featurette explains that Gene Roddenberry, ""Star Trek"" creator, was trying, in part, to transform ""Forbidden Planet"" into a TV series.  Comments from famous directors and special effects wizards express their debt to the film, admiration of this achievement, over half a century after it appeared.Great technicolor in ""Forbidden Planet"" with standard definition DVD, yet even better on Blu-ray in High Definition.  Blu-ray is like discovering a whole new planet.Thus, Amazon should divide customer reviews of DVDs and Blu-rays into those two separate categories: ""DVDs In Standard Definition"", and ""DVDs In Blu-Ray High Definition"".In the Blu-ray column, it would then be extremely helpful for Amazon to carefully identify, describe and distinguish between multiple Blu-ray versions.  This is already a mess with ""No Country For Old Men"", and ""Titanic"" might be even worse.  What I suggest for Blu-rays is entirely impossible as to standard definition DVDs, with their countless different releases.Back on the ""Forbidden Planet"" Blu-ray home page, we get Editorial Reviews of a 2-disc standard definition DVD.  That confused me, since the Blu-ray is only available in a 1-disc version.  Amazon ought to only describe and review the Blu-ray on this page.  I believe Product Details refer to the Blu-ray, but hard to be absolutely certain.  In that best case, Amazon leaves us with Product Details that contradict Editorial Reviews, highly undesirable.If someone from Amazon reads this review, I do hope my suggestions will at least be considered.

It's influence on the  popular &quot;Star Wars&quot; is only evident. This is a good reminder of  what science fiction used to be like: down to earth and captivating. The  story is what really shines forth in this, along with the &quot;50s  style&quot; acting.The DVD is good. The picture is clear (for 1956), but  the lack of extras really detracts from what could have been an excellent  package. The menu is simple and easy to use, although certainly not glitzy.  The only special bonuses that are included are a theatrical trailer, two  sided disk with one being wide screen and the other being regular, and  that's about it. It's pretty disappointing when you consider how many  documentaries and TV spots were doubtless made about this film. If you have  a DVD player, I would suggest purchasing it. However, don't buy a DVD  player just for this DVD, it's not worth it by a long shot.All in all,  it's worth it to science fiction fans.	4.0	&quot;The Forbidden Planet&quot;: A Science Fiction Classic!	2000-09-13	4	4	0

Even Robby the Robot shows up in bits and pieces as the robot in the series ""Lost in Space"".One of the first sci-fi movies that was done on a big budget, Forbidden Planet is loosely based on Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"".  For the time, this is a very beautiful and imaginative movie, tho I do find the idea of Earl Holliman as a space-traveling cook for the crew still wearing an apron and acting like a cook on the wagon train somewhat unbelievable and kinda funny.This is a movie that makes a statement about how we as humans (and apparently the Krell too) can be our own worst enemies."	5.0	Forbidden Planet	2007-09-30	0	0	0

Mcdonald	I own the DVD edition in the metal box that contains the miniature Robby but wanted to see what the Blu-ray edition looked like.It's beautiful. No it's not as sharp and clear as PROMETHEUS but the colors and details are just fantastic. Skin tones and details are particularly revealing and fresh looking and do contribute to the drama. The standouts are the sets and the special effects. The outside night views of the ship against the sky and stars are stunning and I am still amazed at the beauty of the ship's entry into the atmosphere at the beginning. The interior sets also look amazing; Morbius' study looks remarkably fresh.I am still impressed with how well this movie holds up after all these years.

(Will anyone even understand?)  Let me try.  The special effects in FORBIDDEN PLANET were excellent in 1956, are still excellent in 2006, and will remain excellent for as long as the film is shown.

I have always believed the primary component of any lasting film is a great story.  As a child I was as mesmerized by this film as much as I was with ""Star Wars.""  The script is both highly intelligent and highly entertaining, with much more humor and believable horror than one would expect from a 1956 film.  The direction is polished and inventive, with arcing tracking shots and clever editing techniques strewn throughout the picture.  The acting here is very good, with a defining performance from Walter Pidgeon as Doctor Morbius, and a surprising dramatic turn from later-day comic actor Leslie Nielsen.  The supporting cast all shine, each one containing more depth of character than is normally given to secondary roles.  There is a tidy ending where a chain-reaction is started by merely turning a disc then throwing a switch, with irreversible effects.  A Master Race of beings create a machine 20-miles-squared that can be destroyed that easily?  Not likely.  Regardless, this is still one of the best Sci-fi films from the 1950s.

Okay, now you know I'm a senior, but I still know what's good compared with most of the 'junk' made since then.  I met Warren Stevens a few years ago and we had a nice chat about the film.  He laughed when I told him I had only paid 20 cents to get in.  Boy have prices changed.  Anyway, this newly enhanced version is well worth the money.

The featured robot appeared functional and not comic. Everything in this movie holds up well in the present day, except perhaps when an invisible creature is made see-able by blaster fire - it is an a Disney animation and it looks pretty much like it.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	ALFKBRG6DSHI8	Donald G. Marshall	A modern viewer will need some expectation-adjustment--the special effects in this classic film will seem rather cheesy after the wizardry of contemporary film.  But it's a must-see despite that.  To stick with the visuals, the sets and costumes reflect brilliantly the Mid-Century Modernism of LA architecture and design (credit the great and incredibly productive Cedric Gibbons, ably assisted by Arthur Lonergan; the special effects team included Joshua Meador, a pillar of Disney Studios).  Sci fi was a B-movie genre in the '50s, so you rarely got great actors.  But Walter Pidgeon as the hermit and renegade scientist Dr. Morbius (pun on &#34;morbid&#34; intended!), Leslie Nielsen as Commander Adams (yes, &#34;Adam&#34;) sent to rescue the unwilling Dr. Morbius and the spokesperson for intelligent common sense, and Anne Francis as Morbius' daughter are well above the average!  The alert and educated will get it that the film plays off William Shakespeare's great play &#34;The Tempest,&#34; but with a very dark ending.  The music is avant-garde electronica by Bebe and Louis Barron, who also did the music for Maya Deren's great art film &#34;The Very Eye of Night&#34; (1958).  The story enforces the moral that even the most civilized of creatures still harbor within the savage desires and impulses of the id--a view that comes straight out of the pervasive Freudianism of the period.  In all, the film has a depth and artistic significance hard to match in contemporary sci fi (a few films like &#34;Blade Runner&#34; excepted), despite the advances in visual wizardry.	4.0	Great classic sci-fi	2014-01-04	0	0	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2S83VLUV5PJJO	doxtorray	The big advantage of this DVD issue is that there are two versions on the disc. If you prefer the theatrical wide-screen (letterbox) version, that is on one side of the disc, and the pan and scan version that fills the screen  is on the flip side. I have a big-screen monitor, but I prefer the  Academy  Aspect (1.33 to 1) pan and scan, which is actually done better than the  previous-released VHS version. The detail of the sets and the expressions  on the actors' faces are much easier to discern. On this disc, the choice  is yours. Every DVD should be issued this way until we all have widescreen  TVs!While others have made comments that the transfer to video was  poor, I would disagree. There are some artifacts, but the film transfer  quality is much better than the VHS version I purchased several years ago,  and is about the same as those used by cable movie channels. Considering  that the film is nearly fifty years old, this seems reasonable.As for  the film itself, it is simply THE classic Sci-Fi film of the 1950's. It was  so original in so many ways, and still seems fresh and new.  It was one of  the first major-studio big-budget attempts at Science Fiction, and it  succeeds on every level.If you are a sci-fi fan and do not own this  movie, it is a gilt-edged priority that you consider it.  If you own an  older VHS copy, the new DVD release is worth the investment.  You will  watch this again and again.	5.0	Choose your preferred screen size!	1999-12-29	18	17	1

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AJP3DQ745DVV4	Dr. Calvin Posner	The lesson of &#34;TheTempest&#34; that we can be our own worst enemy is evident throughout this wonderful film. This was the first big studio, technicolor science fiction film and so it had all the trappings, big-name cast, special effects, and was a homage to the best writer in the English language. The Blu-Ray rendition is clear and crisp and the sound effects and electronic music are crytal clear. It's sometimes difficult to remember that Leslie Nielsen was once a serious leading man as an actor. Just seeing him makes you want to burst out laughing. I suppose his earlier films are a testament to his craft before he hooked up with the Hollywoood comedy-spoof mavens. I prefer to remember him as the dashing space ship captain in this film. Once you know the secret of the &#34;monster&#34; you also know how the film will end so it's downhill during the final 10 minutes.What's really interesting is watching how they execute the special effects combining animation and stop-frame techniques. Clearly, this is the direction sci-fi films are going to take in the future. Look where that's led us.	5.0	The Tempest Reborn	2013-06-23	2	2	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2AAN5TEDDFY65	Dr. John Bernhart	Of the many fine sci-fi films from B.S.W. (before star wars), two stand out: &#34;This Island Earth&#34; and &#34;Forbidden Planet.&#34;The reason they were so great goes beyond the adventure and state-of-the-art mid-1950s special effects. Both these films had (as did the original Star Trek TV series) unusually strong characterization. But the best thing about them, and here &#34;Forbidden Planet&#34; comes out No.1 of all time in sci-fi films, was the intellectual aspect of the plot. Just imagine- a civilization that built a machine which could bring about whatever they thought, literally turning thoughts into objects and actions, only to be destroyed by the primitive parts of their brains (the &#34;id&#34; of Freud) which could not be controlled by their higher selves. There is nothing in any other film to match the brilliance of that plot twist, and the screenwriters expected the audience, including kids, to understand it (which I did, and was fascinated by, at age 10 in 1956)! Today we crave action, often mindless, with special effects far beyond what the 50s could generate, and that's fun. But how many in today's audience could even understand the science of Forbidden Planet, let alone find mental satisfaction in it that surpasses the thrills of Star Wars by light years. Just imagine- an audience who could think- God bless (and He did) the 1950s!	5.0	One of the finest films in the universe!	2014-02-28	0	0	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2TWIZ33KJCQ54	"Dr. Luther Wolfgang Polaris ""LWP"""	"EXCELLENT STORY BASED ON SHAKESPEARE'S ""THE TEMPEST"" ALSO BOASTS THRILLING EFFECTS,AT THE CORE -- THE SUSPENSE WILL KILL YOU -- ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE ON ALTAIR-4!This very modern looking and well-made film stikes an emotional cord in many viewers and on multiple levels. To make this MGM classic Sci-Fi thriller from 1956 all the more convincing, there is an excellent cast and award winning special-effects, courtesy of Disney. We have love, rage and fear all playing at the same time and it is something to experience -- not just see.WHAT THE 'FORBIDDEN PLANET' IS ALL ABOUT -- [plot spoilers below]It's the 23rd century, and a United Planets Cruiser commanded Commander J.J. Adams [Leslie Nielsen] is on a rescue mission to the planet Altair-4. Apparently, the Earth spaceship Bellerophon vanished, 20 years earlier. The Bellerophon's destination was Altair-4. As we soon discover, there is only one survivor, Doctor Edward Morbius the ship's philologist.According to Webster's New World Dictionary a 'Philologist' is a 'Linguist', 'Scholar', 'grammarian' or 'lexicographer'. This is significant because what Morbius has discovered on Altair-4 will certainly need both a scholar and a linguist to unravel.Strangely and even rudely, Morbius wants no part of any rescue which of course makes Adams very suspicious and they land on Altair-4. What follows is what the film is all about.THE UNSEEN CAN BE VERY SCARY -As the story unfolds, with the help of excellent special effects, especially for 1956, we learn about the disposition of the rest of Morbius's lost crew and find that he has a daughter too. The two are all that have somehow survived some kind of ""planetary force"". As Adams and his crew remain to investigate and to await orders from Earth, that ""planetary force"" somehow returns to wreck havoc. If havoc isn't enough then perhaps some fatalities will get Adams to pack it in and scram.BUT WHERE IS THIS FORCE COMING FROM?Remember, I did say it was scary, it is, especially if you allow your imagination to run away a bit. As time goes by, the force becomes more determined [apparently] and Morbius becomes more disturbed. We learn of an ancient civilization called the Krell, that has become extinct and how this has been a source of major technological innovations that are now part of Morbius's household -- like 'Robby the Robot'. How did Morbius build Robby and what is it that we just don't see? There is a monster in this film and it is about as scary a monster as there ever was, literally indestructible and eternal.SO THE FORBIDDEN PLANET IS A MYSTERY TOO!Just what is this 'Planetary Froce', who controls it and what is the motivation for it is the mystery. As the film proceeds, the emotions: some of love, some of rage and some of frustration are building as they might within a pressure cooker. Here, the pacing of the film really helps to build the suspense, tension and fear. Yes, this can be a scary film. I thought so 50 years ago and still do today after hundreds of viewings.***** THE MAJOR PLAYERS *****Walter Pidgeon - Dr. Edward MorbiusAnne Francis - Alta MorbiusLeslie Nielsen - Commander John J.

Gillespie, 1956 AcademyABOUT THIS WIDESCREEN EDITION VHS: MISSING SCENES ARE RESTOREDThere are several parts of this film that are usually missing, especially when shown on cable. Thankfully, this [widescreen VHS] version has them. One scene is not important and involves a pet monkey being shot with an electrical charge to keep him from eating a banana which was on the dining room table in Mobius's home. The other and more significant scene occurs during Morbius's little lecture, and show and tell session with Adams and Dr. Ostrow [Warren Stevens] in the underground Krell facility. The specific scene is where Morbius tells Adams to fire his blaster at the Krell metal. Adams does so and he and Dr. Ostrow are amazed to find that the metal isn't warm after being subjected to their weapon. I always felt badly that this scene was missing as it ties into what happens in the end by demonstrating how impervious Krell metal is to melting, even when fired at by 23rd century blasters [particle beam blaster].BOTTOM LINE: A TRUE SCIENCE FICTION FILM THAT IS 5-STARS IN 1956 & 2006This is from beginning to end and very compelling film that has aged very well and is still chilling to watch. It is an excellent story, has a well played cast, modern effects and great pacing that leads to a dramatic conclusion."	5.0	'THE FORBIDDEN PLANET' REPRESENTS THE TOP ECHELON OF SCIENCE-FICTION MOVIEMAKING IN THE 1950s	2006-12-22	8	6	2

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3TIYCSPEQV8P9	"D. R. Turgeon ""scooterfan"""	The reviews are in! It's a hit! Well, at least among those of us who have been captivated by the eerie mat-painting backgrounds, the story of inner monsters, a haunting electronic music score, and a humor-tinged robot named  Robby. My stepson and I have developed the same enthusiam for this film,  playing it many times over the years in VHS, LaserDisc and now DVD form.  Sometimes, the generation gap CAN be bridged! This movie was (and still is)  a remarkable piece of film making, along with &quot;The Thing (From Another  Planet) and &quot;The Day The Earth Stood Still&quot;. Science Fiction  movies of the '50s were more often concerned with monsters and communist  political subtexts than in more thoughtfully developed stories about the  primordial instincts of all life. This is a movie that wears well after  many viewings, and even with our jaded &quot;Star Wars&quot; view of space  movies, it remains a magnificent edifice to the film maker's art.	5.0	REMARKABLE FILM MAKING	2000-04-06	3	2	1
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A352H8UIAYHU08	D Severn	This will always be one of the all time classics.  For me it rates right up there with The Day The Earth Stood Still, and the original War of the Worlds.  It is a supurb story and just the right amount of special effects to enhance the story and not detract from it.  Naturally Robby the Robot, who was also a star on TV's Lost In Space, adds to entertainment factor.  A great movie for young and us oldsters alike.	5.0	classic	2013-07-08	0	0	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2MB7ZIINKGPY1	"D. Steinmetz ""dwsteinme"""	Let's be honest here......had it not been for the jaw-dropping special effects (at least for the time), this mundane flick would have been quickly forgotten. As another reviewer pointed out, most of the money for the production seems to have gone for the effects, with only a token amount devoted for the cast and soundtrack. Robby the robot alone cost some $100,000 to create...not a small sum for the mid-1950's. I like Leslie Nielsen, but he was just getting started here. A bit green and it shows. Walter Pidgeon, an otherwise fine and gifted actor, was far past his prime by the time he did 'Forbidden Planet'. Leggy Anne Francis comes off more as dingy blonde prick tease than anything. And I can only assume that a booze-guzzling Earl Holliman was inserted as comic relief.The politically correct crowd will find a lot to gripe about with this film. There wasn't a single African-American in the entire cast. And apparently, females had not yet been trusted to operate, much less travel in, interstellar spacecraft, since Nielsen's crew is entirely male. And even they begin acting like immature teenage boys as soon as they get an eyeful of Anne Francis. As the only female character, she didn't do much to advance the feminist cause. This sort of thing could be found in any number of films from the 1950's. 'Forbidden Planet' most certainly was not the only one.The most annoying thing about this film is the soundtrack. OMG...what were they thinking? An overheated theremin (along with some creative use of reverb and echo) pushes out a near-constant stream of bleeps, warbles, shrieks and other noises that don't sound anything like music. Imagine a pair of white-hot sewing needles being inserted into your eardrums. This film would have been so much better served by a soaring, orchestra-based soundtrack.All in all, this is NOT a bad film, but it has some bad qualities. Worth watching at least once, if for no other reason because it's a classic. But not worth the tons of praise I've seen heaped on it over the years.	2.0	An over-rated classic.	2008-10-19	15	2	13

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2L3VK6QQ91ILU	Earth that Was	"Some of the greatest movies come not out of the art house world of independent producers but from the mass production movie studios. Don't believe me? Well ""Casablanca"" was just another pot boiler off the Warner Brothers lot but by some, probably accidental, cine-magic become one of the most loved classics of all.""Forbidden Planet"" (1956) has some of those classic qualities. In fact it gets better with age. The remastered version on tape or DVD is a positive delight to watch.Generally speaking sci-fi movies date pretty quick. Today's gee whizz special effects become tomorrow's embarassment. Attempts at realism backfire as tomorrow becomes today. Even Star Wars is looking as old fashioned as the personal communicators on Star Trek. Yet with ""Forbidden Planet"" effects obsolescence somehow doesn't seem to have happened. The special effects of Forbidden Planet were good for their day and certainly don't compare to today's CGI effects. Yet as they have dated, instead of seeming just hokey, they seem to take on a more surreal and dream like. This has had the (probably accidental) effect of drawing modern viewers to focus their attention more to the story and character elements, rather than the sets.At the same time the electronic score for the movie reinforces this surreal and other worldly feel. The Bebes' score was actually the first all electronic music score for any movie. The fact that electronic music has tended to move on in other directions, and more or less become mainstream, has helped to reinforce the uniqueness of ""Forbidden Planet"". The music score was even credited as 'electronic tonalities' so as to avoid trouble with the Musicians' Union.The surreal landscape effects and unique score set the mood for Forbidden Planet ...without standing in front of the actors or obscuring the storyline. And the story is really something worthy of art house cinema. At least the ideas are. There is the loose relation between Forbidden Planet and Shakespeare's 'The Tempest' and, then a whole bunch of freudian inspired observations of ""Life, The Universe, Everything.""You could call it ""science freudianism"" as much as ""science fiction"". Sci-Freud. The  most obvious are the ""Monsters from the Id"". If these creatures lurk in the minds of such an advanced and noble race as the Krell, what hope is there for mere mortals like us? It all raises the following question. If the Krell disappeared in one mad day, could it be that the mass destruction, wars and revolutions of our own times also be rooted in some kind of social psycho-pathology? Our monsters from the id.At times the valiant spaceship skipper refers to Dr Mobius's ""enormous ego"". And there is a comment about the need for law and religion to restraint the inner monsters. Mobius, of course, islolates himself from all of Earth's ego restraining institutions via his self imposed isolation on Altair IV, his private paradise planet. There is more than a whiff of deep seated human psychic concerns here too. First there's Mobius, a loving father's desire to protect his socially immature daughter from the attractions and attentions of a spaceship full of red blooded young men. There's rivalry between the leading crew members for Altaira's attention. And there is even the starship skipper's desire to keep his crew of young men (physical specimens he calls them) in line.All of these issues raise the larger concern of human progress. Even if we reach the stars, or as the skipper says, ""in a million years"" build a civilisation to rival the Krell  ....will we really change? ""Forbidden Planet"" manages to keep those human elements to the fore and in a sense presents a morality play with an ageless extraterrestial background. A hundred years from now when someone watches ""Forbidden Planet"" on Mars, it will still look as good."	4.0	"This ""accidentally art house"" classic gets better with age..."	2006-10-21	35	28	7
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3GSGBKCIXB45A	Eddie B.	"I bought Forbidden Planet on blu ray after getting a new TV. I am a huge sci fi fan and have every other movie out there including Star Wars/Star Trek. I was a big fan of the Lost in Space TV show and other old sci fi flicks so I thought I would give this one a try. I'm 22 years old, my 75 year old dad loves this movie and I see him watching it on TV when it's on so I took a shot and bought it on blu ray.Number one, AMAZING movie, especially for the 1950's. The funky sound effects, set design, story, acting, very excellent for such an old movie. If you want more on the movie alone you can go on wiki or IMDB for more on the movie. Regarding the blu ray disc, I LOVE IT! Superior, crystal clear picture and sound. I'm amazed how well it looks for the old cameras. Some older movies/shows I have on blu ray do not have widescreen, but this does, and it looks good. Also, the whole film has that ""film grain"" sci fi quality. It's not too over the top and it compliments the feel of a classic sci fi movie well.The surround sound is great, deep thumping bass, channels mixed fairly well although it's not going to sound like a new movie. Some parts you can tell the recording/mixing equipment wasn't up to where it is today, but it is still very good for the 1950's. Also, this came with ""The Invisible Boy"", a whole second movie in black and white with Robby the Robot. I only watched bits and pieces so far but its interesting. I don't know/think this add-in was remastered in anyway although it was in widescreen and the quality was excellent.$13 bucks? You can't beat it, I say this is a must have for your blu ray collection. Now if you are one of those people that own this movie in six different formats of DVD/VHS/whatever maybe you are skeptical and if you like what you have you don't need to waste more money. But I will say if you don't own this movie already it's definitely worth checking out whether you like sci fi movies or not."	5.0	BLU RAY Review, AMAZING movie, great blu ray quality	2012-08-27	0	0	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A20KFJ5RIZ0ELW	Eddie Munster	Until this day it is still impossible to believe that this Gem - a true Milestone for its time - was created in 1956 . This is the Sci-Fi Classic that actually did 'Boldly go where no man had gone before' and long before Star Trek and its decendents . The transfer from film onto DVD is flawless in every way, the color is rich and dreamscapish the sound is crisp and way ahead of its time, a clear departure from the standard Audio tracking from the 50's . Having not seen Forbidden Planet in quite awhile I had forgotten just how far away from placing an emphasis on quality over making a quick buck we have come . A timeless classic that in fact taught everyone else how to make films of this Genre is nicely packaged in a DVD that is truly one of a kind .

When he isn&#8217;t making booze, he&#8217;s designing gowns.  That&#8217;s what I call handy.The story is fabulous (an overly doctored version of Shakespeare&#8217;s The Tempest); a cruiser travels to the planet Altair IV to learn the fate of an expedition that was sent there 20 years go.  Upon arrival, they&#8217;re told to go away by a snippy linguist, Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon).  Naturally, they refuse to go.  It takes more than the threat of dire consequences to deter the unflappable Commander John J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen).  Of course, if he had left there wouldn&#8217;t have been much of a movie.This movie is fun then frantic as the crew has to stop ogling Anne Francis and start dealing with an invisible monster.  I especially love the monster, glimpsed through the courtesy of Joshua Meador (loaned by Disney to do the job of animating the evil Id).Because of this movie, I learned that there&#8217;s nothing worse than a geezer with a premonition (or a guilty conscience).	5.0	"""I'll have less dreaming aboard this ship!"""	2013-03-03	0	0	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3TIJC6L8USJ6Q	Elderbear	"Many 50's SF movies are based on pulp ideas brought to the screen with hokey effects and plot lines only a freshman comp teacher could possibly accept. Many of them wouldn't even rate as Saturday morning cartoons. Forbidden Planet breaks that mold.No, the effects aren't what you'd expect 45 years later from Dreamworks, but they are carefully crafted using the technologies of the day. The plot leaves us exploring the gap between technical and psychological evolution (something done well in books like Daniel Quinn's ISHMAEL and Eisler's THE CHALICE AND THE BLADE).Character development is a bit immature and somewhat stereotypical, but this doesn't spoil the movie, it just leaves room for improvement in a remake ... Actually, plot development is prototypical for 60's SF TV. Wrestling with philosophical questions in the context of the imaginary future continued with Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, and Star Trek. Some of the music and sound effects now seem a bit comical and MST3Kish, but that's because they were lifted from =THIS= movie by a whole horde of B matinee flicks.Thoroughly entertaining, the best of its genre for its time, this movie is not one to miss. Well worth viewing, even if science fiction isn't your favorite genre. If I'd seen more character development, I'd have given it a full 5 stars, but the conflicts and mysteries of the movie seem to lead to little growth.(If you'd like to discuss this video or review in greater detail, please click on the ""about me"" link above and drop me an email.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2V37BP4L460Z0	Elliot Kallen	A friend of mine once opined that the worst thing to happen to the porno video business was High Definition discs. &#34;Who wants to see every little pore and flaw on somebody's skin?&#34; While I can't comment on THAT particular use of Hi-Def, I CAN say that watching Forbidden Planet on Blu-ray for the first time made for some slightly disillusioning moments, among many more of delight. Given the films age I'm willing to cut it some slack. Even with the obvious nature of most of the movie's special effects (which, at the time, were groundbreaking), great storytelling still shines through so, regardless of the sketchy animation or occasional cheesy miniatures, I can still enjoy the film for what it is - an intelligent, well-written, and totally entertaining Sci-Fi movie. (I disagree with whoever it was who called it the FIRST great Sci-Fi movie. That list of possibilities is long. Think &#34;Things to Come&#34;, &#34;The Day the Eart Stood Still&#34;, etc.) Other folks have described its Shakespearean origins and bemoaned Walter Pidgeon's scenery chewing, but Forbidden Planet still stands the test of time. Would I have appreciated more extras on the disc? Sure, but I'll give this one a hearty recommendation nevertheless.	4.0	Monster from the Id in Blu-ray	2013-03-07	1	0	1
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AXS4QJ0CGH45R	Elocutus55	This film is often cited as a groundbreaking movie of its time. MGM's uber expensive (for that time) film ultimately at that time barely broke even at the box office, but it was worth it. The special effects were state of the art for then, and Robbie the Robot was over $100,000 to make alone.The plot is naturally cheesy in places, but all the tropes of science fiction from the 50's are there, but upgraded to a more believable level. Interesting to see Leslie Nielsen in a serious role.It's easily worth the $10 to watch it on a download and own it forever.If you're a Twilight Zone fan, watch the definitive Blu-Ray set, and you'll see the space ship prop used many many times.	5.0	Must See DVD	2013-08-16	0	0	0

The movie has a great cast with Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis and of course Robby the Robot.  As a sci-fi fan I enjoyed the attention to detail that George Lucas seems to have forgotten.  Notice that the flying saucer doesn't make any noise as there is no sound in space. I also enjoyed the groundbreaking electronic music used in the score of the film. The effects used in the movie were cutting edge at the time and still hold up fifty years later.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A27G747VNYQ17V	Five 28	I ordered the Ultimate Collectors Edition (HD-DVD) back in December. I finally got around to watching it yesterday in my weeks old Toshiba HD-A2 HD-DVD player. To my surprise, I found that this disc is a standard DVD version which outputs at 480p, and not an HD-DVD. I think Amazon may have inadvertently mislabeled it. If you want a true high definition version, you must order the one with the red HD-DVD case or you will end up with a standard definition version.update: I contacted Amazon about the issue of receiving a standard DVD instead of an HD-DVD and they apologized and shipped me another Ultimate Collectors Edition (this time correctly in HD-DVD) and said that I could keep the standard def version as well. Amazon definitely does what it takes to ensure customer satisfaction. The image quality of the HD-DVD version is obviously better than the standard def version, but it will not blow you away in image quality.	3.0	Love the movie, but only 3 stars because it is not HD-DVD	2007-03-17	9	6	3

I remember watching this on the Turner Classic Movies channel and it was barely watchable but now it's like watching a new film!  While the picture quality isn't perfect as there are a few problematic frames here and there but compared to what I saw on the TCM channel the difference is like night and day.  As for the sound quality the DTS HD MA 5.1 sound is fantastic.  The special features are very good as well with great documentaries and even the not-so-good ""sequel"" featuring Robby the Robot ""The Invisible Boy"" which comes across more like a kiddy comedy than its much more serious and better prior film.  ""Forbidden Planet"" marks a number of firsts such as being MGM's first serious Sci-Fi film, the birth of techno music for the score, the depiction of man travelling faster than light and exploring other planets and for fans of Star Trek like myself you get the feeling that you are watching the true pilot of Star Trek: TOS.  Star Trek: TOS is like the serialised tv version of the ""Forbidden Planet"" feature film like the way it was for ""M*A*S*H"".  The relationship between the doctor and the captain prefigures Bones and Kirk, the short mini skirts that Anne Francis wears and the sexual innuendoes also show up on Star Trek: TOS while the reference to adamantium metal reminded me of Wolverine and the deep shafts underground reminded me a lot of the Death Star in ""Star Wars"" and of a couple of episodes in the early seasons of ""Babylon 5"" concerning the strange being on the planet below the space station.  Even Disney Studios had a hand in the special effects here as MGM takes a genre that was at the time ""B"" movie fodder into the ""A"" grade.Fans of Sci-Fi simply have to have this in their video library as an example of a pioneer and major influencer of many sci-fi films that followed.Highly recommended!"	4.0	The Father of Star Trek Has Just Gotten A Whole Lot Better!	2011-05-01	2	2	0

It is the template upon which Star Trek is based, and the tale of alien contact it tells is similar to that told in 2001 - in fact, until that film was released in 1968, this was the benchmark science fiction film in every technical sense and remains to this day the superior entertainment experience, telling its complex and robust tale more coherently and more entertainingly.  with a brilliant script based loosely on Shakespeare's The Tempest and layered over with Jungian and Freudian meanings as well as themes relevant to both the cold war and to the age of global warming, this film sports uncommonly strong acting, and possesses  production values which are nothing less than beautiful. In fact, it is one of the most visually beautiful films in all of movie science fiction.

The other area of interest was the technical representation of the craft. One aspect in particular struck me as a now retired sound engineer was the 'cordless' microphone the captain used - there were none in commercial production in 1956 but now!

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A9KOIFCCG5J80	FXDF	I've viewed this film in various formats since the 1960s.  The Blu-ray transfer is by far the best version.  I suspect it looks better than most of the prints that originally went through theaters in 1956.  They put a lot of effort into making this picture look great.When I'm paying twice the price for a Blu-ray disk than I do for a DVD, I do it to get a better image.  And so often this is not the case.  But I definitely got my money's worth on Forbidden Planet.As far as the movie itself goes, it's a clever premise and Walter Pidgeon knew how to act.  But the other actors are pretty stinko. And the screenwriting is just plain awful. However, it's worth seeing just for the analog special effects that had to have been the best put in any movie of the 1950 decade.  And with this excellent transfer the effort behind them really shows.Besides, how can you possibly pass up watching 30-year old Leslie Nielson playing a straight romantic lead in high definition?!?!?	4.0	Looks great on Blu-ray	2011-04-01	12	9	3

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	FORBIDDEN PLANET is certainly one of the most influential films of the 20th Century, containing an unusual story line, some remarkable concept art designs, a superior musical score, and a special effects robot that set the standard for science-fiction films for some thirty years and still continues to influence film makers today.  Unfortunately, the film is also a very static one, ultimately less interesting for any sense of excitement than for purely visual appeal.In general, the story--which is famous for being very loosely based on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST--concerns a deep space mission helmed by Leslie Nielson sent to relieve colonists of a distant planet. Upon arriving, they find only two survivors: an inhospitable Walter Pidgeon and his beautiful daughter Anne Francis.  Pidgeon warns the relief mission against landing on the planet, lest the mysterious and evil force that destroyed the original colonists be once more unleashed, but land they do... and soon they too fall victim to an unseen but fearsome killer.There are many marvelous things about the film.  The robot--suggested by Shakespeare's character Ariel--is truly the single most enjoyable element of the film, with much of the film's best lines and a memorable personality to boot.  Anne Francis--again suggested by Shakespeare's Miranda--gives quite a remarkable performance as a beautiful young woman raised without knowledge of mankind.  The art designs, whether of the lost alien civilization, the home in which Pideon and Francis live, or Francis' costumes, are stunning.  Even so...Perhaps it is more a matter of passing time than anything else.  Both Nielson and Pidgeon's performances seem unnecessarily restrained and the cinematography is extremely static. The film as a whole seems to lack excitement and, although intriguing, the story itself is handled in a very conventional way.  Fans of classic science fiction cannot afford to be without FORBIDDEN PLANET, and most viewers will enjoy seeing it at least once, but for all its influence and visual beauty many may find that one viewing is enough.Word of Warning: make absolutely certain that you are purchasing the widescreen version of the film, for the pan-and-scan seriously undercuts the film's visual appeal.	4.0	Influential Film Is Surprisingly Static	2001-12-29	4	3	1

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2NE80DF5BYBWC	GDC	I saw this movie in a theater at the age of 7 when it first came out in 1956. Audiences had never before seen such fantastic sets and mind blowing special effects. And its Oscar-nominated soundtrack was straight from the world of your strangest dreams, pure long-hair electronic music played on one of the earliest true synthesizers, full of beeps and whistles and swoops and fear and rage coursing throughout the entire movie non-stop. That soundtrack was to haunt me throughout my entire life, giving me a love of electronic music and synthesizers, and leading me to buy an analog ARP Avatar synth in the 1980s and learn it and study it until I could produce any sounds that I could hear in my mind. I have a PhD, and I consider myself to be an accomplished wordsmith, and yet all the superlatives I know still fail to capture the absolute genius of Forbidden Planet as the greatest movie of all time. Its 50th anniversary restoration in 2006 is masterful: all the vibrant colors have been restored, and its original mono soundtrack (stereo hadn't even been invented yet in 1956) has been creatively remastered into 5 channel surround sound. This new edition would be inexpensive at twice the price.

Arnold	"So much has been written about this film, I'm sure I won't add anything you may not already have read.The intelligence with which this film was written is an argument that thinking people want to be challenged by what they are being offered. The medium is not the message, but the message can be conveyed by the medium.The power of ideas reigns supreme in good writing. The visual aspects of a film have to contribute, not overwhelm, to the overall story, the ideas, being presented for our consideration. This film balances both very well.And for a film made in 1956, viewing it today is every bit as powerful as the ideas conveyed in another classic, ""Metropolis"", from 1926. While there maybe elements that 'date' such films, the power of ideas clearly keeps these kinds of films relevant to today. Why? Because the ideas are timeless, the topics are the stuff of the human condition, which never changes, no matter the era in which they are portrayed.And when a film addresses these deeper kinds of things, when done with intelligence and with care for the way it is presented, absent ""flavour of the moment"" distractions, such films are destined to become classics that withstand the test of time - because the topics themselves are timeless."	5.0	Another film that showed the power of ideas.	2011-11-24	4	4	0

Naively, as I saw it around its first 1956 release, it's an exciting space opera with dirty little secrets and still very handsome special effects, and one of the eeriest scores ever (it has as much of a sonic fingerprint as ""Psycho""). With a little more knowledge, it's a nice pulp streamlining of ""The Tempest"", and if Anne Francis doesn't get to say, ""O brave new world that has such people in't..."", she looks as if she could, and would. Robbie, of course, makes a splendid Ariel (also nice that he escapes the apocalypse to assist Will Robinson).Beyond that, there's the tickle of ""creation without instrumentality"" and quite forgetting about the old Id.

What I am making note of here is that this Blu-Ray gives you everything that is in the original DVD 2 disc version except on a single dual-layered disc (and even then the second layer may not have been necessary).  Yes, the extras are in SD.  But, the maximum storage for the DVD set combined is about 15 GBs.  Even with the extra GBs for the HD content, they still could have placed everything on a single-layered BD!It proves what I always suspected, that a lot of room is being wasted on these discs and we as consumers are eating that cost.  There are some multi-movie sets that could be placed on a single Blu-Ray and still maintain all of their HD audio and video.  Case in point, the recent BD Harryhausen set I bought could have easily been on 2 discs rather than 4, and if they left off the colorized versions (what was the point?), all 4 of those films could have been transferred to a single dual-layered disc and still maintain their HD quality!It is about time that the studios stop ripping-off their meal-ticket.The rating above is for the movie, its transfer and the overall value contained here.	5.0	This disc proves what I always suspected.	2011-03-17	10	2	8

But while I've seen it hundreds of times, I've NEVER seen it as crisp, clean and beautifully displayed as in this HD-DVD version.

I am here to say Job well done! The restoration and HD transfer are flawless, It's a testament to the skill of the original matte painters that their backgrounds hold up so well under the glare of HD. The special features, especially the Robbie one are first rate. The only problem I had was with the remastered sound. I had never noticed how complicated the electronic 'score' was but now you can hear every sound clearly. My problem? There were a couple times when it could have been a little lower in relation to the dialog track. Other than that nit picky complaint I am beyond pleased.	5.0	An HD must	2007-11-16	10	9	1
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AK0K6IHPVAAOC	Goat_Whisperer	What's not to like about this film?  A spaceship is sent to discover the fate of an Earth colony on a distant planet and the crew finds only two of the original colonists alive.  This world happens to be the home of a long vanished alien civilization and the secret of an unknown, invisible menace that begins to threaten everyone soon after they land.  The special effects are great, especially given when the film was made.  I understand that Disney artists hand painted, frame by frame, most of the effects.  I won't spoil the surprise if you haven't seen it but rest assured it is 1950's sci-fi at its best.  There is the obligatory love story, the hapless victim/villain, and a monster that is all the more menacing because it is invisible.  The end features a plot hole big enough to drive a truck through but otherwise a believable story.  If you like sci-fi, add this one to your collection.	5.0	One of my favorites	2014-01-10	0	0	0

Matte paintings.  The legendary scenes of the Krel (sp?) power generating machines.  The Krel brain booster, apparently set up for a being with multiple appendages.  The one appearance of the lion-like ""Monster From the Id"" in the electrical fence while being bombarded by neutron-beam weapons.The one question that anyone who has seen this masterpiece has over the 50 years since the film's release is:  What did the Krel really look like?  The film provides only inferences:  The aforementioned brain booster.  The triangular doors.  The mystery of the appearance of the Krel is a primary aspect that separates this film from all others in the 1950s-and the modern age for that matter.  How many SF films can you name where a character as significant as the Krel makes no visual appearance whatsoever?  The only one I can think of in a similar vein is Universal's ""The Invisible Man"", but Claude Rains is visible at points in the film.""Forbidden Planet"" is really about the mysterious Krel, who were so advanced technologically they were able to gain control over the very essence of their material bodies.  The mystery of why they left no record of their physical appearance only makes the irony of their destruction by the evil of ""The Mindless Primitive"" within even more interesting.The advent of CGI seems to have all but erased this type of mystery from today's films-to moviegoers detriment."	4.0	The Big Question?	2007-05-10	0	0	0

The story was very interesting, and the plot really held my attention. The characters were very well done, and the acting was superb. I  know that this is based on some old Shakespear play, but hey, I never  really cared for his stuff. But this movie is fantastic!The thing that  surprised me the most was the special effects. They were amazing. The sets  and vehicles and backgrounds all looked so well done. It's hard to believe  that this film was made nearly half a century ago. One of the good things  about the special effects is that the movie didn't focus on the effects.  Instead, the effects were simply treated as if they were natural occurences  and so nobody really paid any attention to them. The special effects were a  part of the film, but they were not the film itself.I could tell that  this movie is a big influence on many later to come sci-fi things. For  example, I could see big pieces of Star Trek and Star Wars, and also some  elements of 2001 and Lost in Space.But the main reason that I will be  watching this movie again and again is because of the story. This is the  kind of film that really makes you think. The story drags you in right  away. It really held my attention.The picture quality on this DVD is  excellent. The colors are stong and bold, without ever being overbright or  intrusive. And the letterbox presentation does a fine job of showing the  film in the format that it was intended to be seen.	5.0	Wow!

Our teenagers like the film as much as my husband and I do, and that's saying something.

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi"""	"IN A NUTSHELL: THE SUSPENSE WILL KILL YOU -- ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE ON ALTAIR-4!This very modern looking and well-made film stikes an emotional cord in many viewers and on multiple levels. To make this MGM classic Sci-Fi thriller from 1956 all the more convincing, there is an excellent cast and award winning special-effects, courtesy of Disney. We have love, rage and fear all playing at the same time and it is something to experience -- not just see.WHAT THE 'FORBIDDEN PLANET' IS ALL ABOUT: [some plot spoilers below]It's the 23rd century, and a United Planets Cruiser commanded Commander J.J. Adams [Leslie Nielsen] is on a rescue mission to the planet Altair-4. Apparently, the Earth spaceship Bellerophon vanished, 20 years earlier. The Bellerophon's destination was Altair-4. As we soon discover, there is only one survivor, Doctor Edward Morbius the ship's philologist.According to Webster's New World Dictionary a 'Philologist' is a 'Linguist', 'Scholar', 'grammarian' or 'lexicographer'. This is significant because what Morbius has discovered on Altair-4 will certainly need both a scholar and a linguist to unravel.Strangely and even rudely, Morbius wants no part of any rescue which of course makes Adams very suspicious and they land on Altair-4. What follows is what the film is all about.THE UNSEEN CAN BE VERY SCARY -As the story unfolds, with the help of excellent special effects, especially for 1956, we learn about the disposition of the rest of Morbius's lost crew and find that he has a daughter too. The two are all that have somehow survived some kind of ""planetary force"". As Adams and his crew remain to investigate and to await orders from Earth, that ""planetary force"" somehow returns to wreck havoc. If havoc isn't enough then perhaps some fatalities will get Adams to pack it in and scram.BUT WHERE IS THIS FORCE COMING FROM -Remember, I did say it was scary, it is, especially if you allow your imagination to run away a bit. As time goes by, the force becomes more determined [apparently] and Morbius becomes more disturbed. We learn of an ancient civilization called the Krell, that has become extinct and how this has been a source of major technological innovations that are now part of Morbius's household -- like 'Robby the Robot'. How did Morbius build Robby and what is it that we just don't see? There is a monster in this film and it is about as scary a monster as there ever was, literally indestructible and eternal.SO THE FORBIDDEN PLANET IS A MYSTERY TOO!Just what is this 'Planetary Froce', who controls it and what is the motivation for it is the mystery. As the film proceeds, the emotions: some of love, some of rage and some of frustration are building as they might within a pressure cooker. Here, the pacing of the film really helps to build the suspense, tension and fear. Yes, this can be a scary film. I thought so 50 years ago and still do today after hundreds of viewings.***** THE MAJOR PLAYERS *****Walter Pidgeon  - Dr. Edward MorbiusAnne Francis  - Alta MorbiusLeslie Nielsen  - Commander John J.

Gillespie,  1956 AcademyABOUT THIS WIDESCREEN EDITION VHS: MISSING SCENES ARE RESTOREDThere are several parts of this film that are usually missing, especially when shown on cable. Thankfully, this [widescreen VHS] version has them. One scene is not important and involves a pet monkey being shot with an electrical charge to keep him from eating a banana which was on the dining room table in Mobius's home. The other and more significant scene occurs during Morbius's little lecture, and show and tell session with Adams and Dr. Ostrow [Warren Stevens] in the underground Krell facility. The specific scene is where Morbius tells Adams to fire his blaster at the Krell metal. Adams does so and he and Dr. Ostrow are amazed to find that the metal isn't warm after being subjected to their weapon. I always felt badly that this scene was missing as it ties into what happens in the end by demonstrating how impervious Krell metal is to melting, even when fired at by 23rd century blasters [particle beam blaster].BOTTOM LINE: A TRUE SCIENCE FICTION FILM THAT IS 5-STARS IN 1956 & 2006This is from beginning to end and very compelling film that has aged very well and is still chilling to watch. It is an excellent story, has a well played cast, modern effects and great pacing that leads to a dramatic conclusion."	5.0	"EXCELLENT STORY BASED ON SHAKESPEARE'S ""THE TEMPEST"" ALSO BOASTS THRILLING EFFECTS"	2006-09-14	22	18	4

Moviemaking at its absolute best here!Before special effects became the main attractions, &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; had already set the &quot;high-bar&quot; in space travel science fiction.  A truly intelligent plot divulged here along with a moral line that's woven so skillfully inside.The humorous portion of the film is also well underplayed with witty dialogue subtly woven into the action.  Leslie Nielsen gives us a small glimpse into his comedic side as the strong and handsome commander.  Walter Pidgeon is perfect in his role as the language expert who analyzes the powerful alien technology.Anne Francis is truly beautiful in this production, and plays her part with engaging enthusiasm.  She veils her hidden love for the commander Nielsen by mocking his &quot;I'll put more guards on the guards!&quot; and claiming that she &quot;just doesn't like him!&quot;  It's great!Robby the Robot is great ... with a perfect voice and a demeanor that never gets tiring ... What's still nice about this film is that the technology, while a major part of the story, really takes a backseat to the characters as you watch them try to deal with the invisible, but deadly 30-foot monster than can tear buildings to shreds and melt supposedly impenetrable walls.  I believe this concept was used as the basis for one of the episodes of the great &quot;Johnny Quest&quot; cartoon series where an invisible creature, leaving footprints, follows a trail of electric lights to its end.There's the ship's cook who's rewarded with 60 gallons of his favorite hooch ... a burping robot who ingests the hooch to analyze its molecules ... a little love rivalry between the men ... holograms (simulated) in an early sci-fi movie ... great costumes for all the actors ... and enough sound effects to make you feel like you're watching a Saturday afternoon matinee at your local theatre ...This is science fiction at its absolute best ... the original Star Trek comes a very close second ... but it was a series with many, many wonderful stories ... my advice is to be an avid collector of both!	5.0	UnMatched Science Fiction!	2000-12-31	2	2	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1CZ7PH2JNRUCL	HG fan	In the fifties the public had an insatiable appetite for space movies and monsters. Most features produced were low-budget 'B'-movies and producers were using the genre simply as a cash-cow. Every now and again came the exception to the rule... Forbidden Planet is one of these... a stellar cast, high productions values, a fabulous script, a large budget, filmed in color, and cutting edge graphics for the day! 'Robbie' the robot was so well done, that for many years, most people actually thought it was mechanical rather than an actor in a suit.Anne Francis and Walter Pidgeon were the headliners but the supporting cast members would soon become household names themselves. The story in a nutshell... A space ship arrives at planet Altair 4 to find out what happened to colonists sent there twenty years before. Morbius (Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Francis) are the only survivors and Morbius tries to warn the ship away. The ship lands and is met by Robbie and taken to Morbius' house. The ship is delayed from taking off and during the night some valuable equipment is destroyed. The captain (Leslie Neilsen), his exec officer (Jack Kelly) and the doc (Warren Stevens) pay Morbius another visit, thinking he may know more than he's telling. Morbius winds up giving the trio a tour of a vast underground complex he has found left by the Krell, who occupied the planet 250,000 years before. Morbius is confused that on the eve of the Krell's greatest discovery, the mental creation and transport of matter to any point on the planet, the whole population seems to have been destroyed in a single night! These sets are very impressive even by todays standards. Morbius shows the trio a machine that he hooked himself up to that permanently doubled his already genius IQ but nearly killed him. A crewmember is torn apart inside the ship and the captain and doc return to the house to demand answers. While the captain persues his love interest, Altaira, doc takes the brainboost and before he dies tells the captain about monsters from the 'id' (the subconscious). Its is only after more mayhem that the captain finally puts together that Morbius is sending out monsters from his id and once again confronts Morbius, who eventually confronts his own deamons and lies dying in the lab. He has the captain throw a switch that sets an irreversable chain reaction off in the planet's core. The ship takes off and the planet is destroyed.This movie is a must-have for your 'vintage' collection.	5.0	The gold standard for early (classic) SciFi...	2006-01-20	2	2	0

It is entertaining, and that is mostly what I care about when I watch a movie.The special effects were quite advanced for the time.There are some familiar pieces to the storyline as later movies and TV shows of a similar genre borrowed from it, and it borrowed from earlier stories, as happens with most such works.A flying saucer is sent to check up on a colony that Earth has lost contact with. They find the colony has all died except for a single person and his daughter. Somehow the man has constructed an advanced robot to do his bidding. Robby the Robot is even credited in the movie.Crew members start to die. The captain takes a romantic interest in the daughter.Walter Pigeon plays the man, Ann Francis is his daughter. Leslie Nielsen is the ship's captain. Richard Anderson and Earl Holliman are two more familiar faces.	5.0	A good early SF movie	2014-04-10	0	0	0

I was disappointed.While Morbius is giving the Grand Tour of the Krell Machine he states:""For 2000 centuries it has waited patiently here tuning and lubricating itself, replacing worn parts. I have reason to believe that 16 years ago a minor alteration was performed throughout the entire 8000 cubic milesof its own fabric.""The Dialogue then continues awkwardly, never explaining the ""Alteration.""35 years ago I watched this film on a Sunday Afternoon, on Broadcast TV. In that version Morbius went on to explain how he observed a Belt that was 50 miles long being replaced by the Krell Machine.His explanation lasted less than ten seconds, but it enabled the dialogue to flow smoothly. These ten seconds are missing in this and every other copy of the film I've ever seen since that Sunday afternoon so long ago.Has ANYONE else ever noticed this ?"	5.0	Where's the missing dialogue of the Krell Machine ?	2006-12-25	9	7	2

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1YRV8ICHSL41F	"Inchoatus.com ""Inchoatus.com"""	"WHY YOU SHOULD VIEW THIS:This is a very suspenseful and entertaining film. It will appeal to both adults and children and with a ""G"" rating, makes for a great family video night. Adults will enjoy the mature themes and will be compelled by the well-developed plot. Children will instantly fall for Robby the Robot and enjoy the special effects. The violence is kept to a minimum and is mostly off-screen. This is a great film to use to introduce children to the world of adult speculative fiction. Too many of their choices consist of situations driven by shallow plot devices, overly-expository villains whose vocabulary is littered with phrases such as ""you fool!"" or ""the universe/planet/pokemon is now mine!"" and bland heroes lacking any concept of self-awareness.WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:Although a landmark film, this was still made in the 50's and as such, many of the characters are under-developed or even clich&eacute;. The techno-futuristic soundtrack sounds like it was created by bending a two-man saw and is about as fun to experience as a pap-smear.Even with these minor shortcomings, there is really only one scenario we could think of in which a person would pass on this film. If you are about to be stranded on a deserted island and are given the choice of only one film, then by all means, this is probably not the one you will take. All in all, however, we gave this a 6 so make your own conclusions.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"	5.0	A successful marriage of sci-fi adventure and high-brow idea	2004-10-01	6	2	4

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A21H21WR8821K	ITCS	Leslie Nielsen in a straight dramatic role.  What??  Yes.The first really good sci-fi movie in history.  It was the watershed '50s sci-fi epic.  Nothing that followed it measured up to it, though both we and the Japanese tried over and over again.  It blew away everything before it and sparked the imaginations of an entire generation.  Yeah, parts of it are trite, campy, and predictable to the modern eye, and there are a lot of '50s anachronisms (like the imitation Plymouth tail fins on the speeder).  Still, it was well written, well acted, and well directed with killer effects done by folks they borrowed from Disney.  The effects and ideas were so innovative that 15 or so years later, Star Trek ripped off a bunch of the effects, equipment, and ideas.This movie launched the career of Robbie the Robot (the real star of the show) who went on to star in several other movies as both a good guy and a bad guy.  His body was made of the material they made luggage out of back then.  He finally wore out.  Some of the mechanical effects broke and Robbie started to fall apart. Robbie was first put in a museum, then moved to storage, then finally sold at auction.Lost In Space ripped off the idea Robbie the robot, and hired the same guy who built Robbie to build one for their show.  The final construct wasn't as convincing as Robbie because the Lost in Space budget was considerably smaller.	5.0	Classic sci-fi	2013-02-26	0	0	0

And three documentaries on disc two. I own the original two-sided one disc version. I saw no difference in picture quality for either edition. Don't panic. The picture looks very good to begin with.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	ANEZJYKUDNJYQ	Jack Rice	This movie established the benchmark of what science fiction should be.  The irony is this:  the movie that made me a SciFi fan also spoiled me, for nothing I have seen or read since even comes close.  Unfortunately for the  genre, what passes for SciFi today is mainly &quot;cowboys in  space&quot;.If I were to do a remake, I would be hard pressed to outdo  the production values.  I would, however, eliminate the trite Earl Holliman  (as a cook named . . . Cookie) skit with Robby Robot.  In fact, it made me  deduct one star and give Forbidden Planet a mere  * * * * *  .Forbidden Planet remains the best SciFi film ever made, and one of the  greatest of all films.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AGG2AAKY8QSY1	Jaime	"This is definite a film worth seeing whether you are a sci-fi fan or a student of film. It is one of the ""serious"" sci-fi films of the 50's. It is easy to be jaded when watching older sci-fi; a lot were cheaply made and consisted of rubber-suited actor as a monster terrorizing the local populace. However, some films like Forbidden Planet did have high production values and thoughtful scripts. Although I don't think it is as good (or holds up as well) as ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", this film is still very watchable today. Frequently listed as being loosely based on ""The Tempest"", it really uses that as a starting point, because there are myriad other concepts original to this film that have been repeatedly copied over the years.What I find funny is some of the reviewer of this film. Complaining about the ""Laughable"" effects and ""lame"" attempts at humor. This film was made in 1956! You need to view in that light; there were no SGI workstations and Lightwave software to create the effects that are so commonplace today.Several reviewers, including some claiming to be sci-fi fans and the Amazon editorial reviewer, are confused about the robot. Robbie the robot, who first appeared in this film, IS NOT the robot on Lost in Space. That robot wasn't even called Robbie, his name simply was ""Robot"". There is no doubt that Robbie served as an inspiration for Robot on Lost in Space, but they are two different robots. Robbie has legs and walks, Robot has tracks and rolls; Robbie has segmented arms and sort of fat fingers, Robot has retractable accordion arms and thin curved pinchers.I probably should have knocked a half star off for the mediocre transfer, but still worth watching."	4.0	Good movie, worth seeing, but some silly reviewer here!	2005-03-10	5	4	1

This movie was years ahead of its time and had 5x the budget of any science fiction picture to date. Walter Pidgeon's performance of Dr. Morbius is masterful and the plot is deep and complex.

The only real  competition to Robbie is the robot from Lost in Space - which was also designed by Bob Kinoshita.

It was the Star Wars of its era and nothing came close until Stanley Kubrick's 2001 in the late 60's. The science fiction was excellent for the time frame and the movie's premise still holds today - we all have our secret (and sometimes not so secret) &#34;ID&#34;. In other words, all of us as humans have a Self centered Independent Nature. As the movie says, &#34;That's why we have rules and religion&#34; (to keep things in check and under control). Frankly, I doubt that line could be said in a movie today. This is a thinking person's film while also being entertaining and visually stunning. The special effects still hold their own today as does the electronic music - a first in the 50s. Well worth watching.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A21255BRFATUHE	Jazz Officer Spaak	"Skimming already posted reviews, I saw none that actually address the Blu-ray version released Sep. 2010!! So let's get to it: Do I love this movie? This is my fifth version of it, following the VHS, LaserDisc, initial DVD and remastered DVD versions. This is what you need to know: There is very little discernible improvement in the image over the standard DVD versions. I guess this must be attributed to a largely subdued initial color palette/lighting and fading of the original Technicolor images. My screen only ""lit up"" and looked like a Blu-ray image during the major confrontation with the Monster from the Id.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A6DH4F9ACJ62F	J. Berry	This science fiction remake of Shakespeare's The Tempest is one of the few gems which still sparkle from its era. Leslie Nielsen gives a star performace as does Walter Pidgeon. The story is grippingly suspenseful as  well as giving a thoughtful look at human nature, with some fantastic comic  moments and great special effects for the time. With the strange twist at  the end it makes for compelling viewing. Happily, it hasn't - yet - been  remade and trashily jazzed up for modern cinema.	5.0	Brilliant sci fi tale with a sting	2000-02-03	2	1	1

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A10XB56QFYLVC8	Jeff Chan	Forbidden Planet was always a science fiction favorite of mine due to it's outlandish setting, great acting, great sets, great characters, excellent science fiction and human element.  It's pretty much everything good science fiction should be but too seldom actually achieves: intellectually stimulating, frightening, sexy, bold in story and look, fantastic, etc.  This 2006 remastering is stunningly beautiful even on a standard DVD.  Someone kept or found an excellent print or negative which is very fortunate.So in this Forbidden Planet DVD we have arguably the most significant science fiction film of the surrounding decades beautifully restored to probably better than it's ever been seen in a theater.  Kudos to the makers and restorers of this classic.For those who haven't seen Forbidden Planet, it's been likened to Shakespeare's Tempest set in space, but it has interesting plot twists of its own.  This film significantly influenced every movie or television series set on a spaceship, particularly Star Trek which followed about a decade later.The extras include deleted scenes which were rightfully deleted.  Those scenes edited out, the theatrical release is much tighter, if one can forgive the ugly jump cuts that result.I highly recommend this science fiction classic, especially for the wonderful remastering.	5.0	Sci-fi classic beautifully restored	2008-11-10	0	0	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3RRBTSV0WDEAP	Jeff	The plot was imaginative and gave a feel for how things were looked at in the 1950's (Earl Holloman as the whining, witless, alcoholic cook was considered comic relief. Also, compare Leslie Nielson's somewhat stiff and cardboard character in this movie with his more recent performance as the anything but stiff detective Frank Drebin in Police Squad). The film's use of Disney Studios for special effects was inspired. Disney's mix of technical expertise and imagination was close to the gold standard at that time (and, in my opinion, is still pretty outstanding today) and is a major factor, again in my opinion, in explaining the appeal of this film over the decades.	5.0	a sci-fi classic	2013-06-05	1	0	1

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1J54MHV2XYC76	Jeremy Weidenhof	Forbidden Planet is easily one of the finest science fiction movies ever made.  Although released in 1956, it still compares favorably with much flashier movies from more recent years.  The film is not a  &quot;blast-fest&quot; in the Star Wars style, but blends modest action and  beautiful hand painted special effects with a fascinating study of basic  human nature.  Those expecting 1950's B-movie special effects will be  pleasantly surprised, as top quality hand rendered artwork abounds, as well  as a flying saucer with no strings attached!  Also, one of the more  memorable big-screen automatons, Robby the Robot, appears in much of the  film.  The movie also contains some of the best sci-fi film music ever  recorded, as it rises and falls to the mood of the scenes. To complement  the attractive visuals and sounds is excellent casting, with Walter Pidgeon  perfectly suited to the imperious Dr. Morbius.  Fine performances by Leslie  Nielsen and Anne Francis, among others, help create a dramatic tension you  can feel as the film nears its climax. Monsters, mystery and a little humor  make Forbidden Planet a genuine classic, which any sci-fi fan should take  time to enjoy!	5.0	A &quot;hand-crafted&quot; masterpiece of science fiction.	1998-12-11	0	0	0

Overall the transfer looks nice, the only thing I take issue with is that when they do the fades and dissolves between scenes.  Whenever that happens all the effects they have used to enhance the original film disappear and you are left viewing the original source film, which I found jarring and decreased the enjoyment of the viewing experience.  It looks like they put this through a computer on cruse control but it couldn't deal with the fading out, so it just doesn't apply any processing.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	ATQZQR4H8BEN6	"J. M. Cornwell ""Reviewer at Large"""	"Forbidden Planet has always been my favorite science fiction movie sicne I first saw it as a child at the theaters and on television. I was captivated by the story, which is what was meant to happen by filmmakers who took some liberties with the original book by Irving Block and Allen Adler, a fact I didn't know until I found the book earlier this week.I am no stranger to the way Hollywood changes books to fit the Hollywood version of happily ever after when there is no happy and sometimes no ever after. Very seldom does Hollywood stick to the script, except in the case of Cecil B. DeMille, and that is mostly because he remade his blockbusters at least three times and used the same script each time. The problem is that even DeMille changed the script to fit his vision of what the book should look like; I know that because I actually read Ben Hur:A Tale of the Christ, for instance, by Lew Wallace, who also wrote several other historical novels. That is a story for another time.Although director, Fred M. Wilcox, stuck pretty closely to the book's dialogue and story, he softened Edward Morbius and left out the dialogue that covers the real reason why Morbius was such a danger to mankind and the universe and chose to die with the planet. Morbius committed the ultimate sin; he wanted to create life.Do you remember the scene at the Gateway -- it was called the Teacher in the movie? Morbius at down at the machine with the probes touching his head and he ""sculpted"" a figure of Altaira, his daughter. Morbius said the figure was alive because Altaira was alive in his memory from moment to moment. Big lie! And what about Alta's friends? How did they get to Altair IV and remain exactly the same for 2000 centuries (that is 200,000 years in Earth time when math is applied)? Would not animals brought from Earth to Altair IV have adapted to their new world with protective coloring and attributes? Wouldn't they also have been destroyed in the night and day that destroyed the Krell? And yet there are monkeys (one of five different species, all males), two female deer obviously in their first year of life, and a Bengal tiger roaming the planet far from any other herds or visible life, and they just happened into Morbius's compound. Funny how the men from Earth spaceship C-57-D never glimpse any movement or signs of herds or life of any kind on Altaira IV when they arrived.Also missing from the movie is Major Ostrow, the doctor, dissecting a titi monkey Captain J. J. Adams just happened to back over when they were trying to uncover Morbius's secret meetings with the Krell still alive and kicking on the planet. The rest of the monkeys were also absent, but that may be due to having to deal with five monkeys on the set. They weren't really needed since the point of the monkeys in the first place was deleted from the script.Are you beginning to get what is missing? What Hollywood thought too shocking for the American family in 1956 to grasp and see splashed across the scene in Disney's best special effects?The real reason for the Krell's demise in the book is hinted at in several ways on the screen, and the annhilation of an entire species becomes more of a punchisment for usurping the Universe's -- or God's -- power. It is the same power that Dr. Morbius usurps and why he wants to hold onto the planet without Earth involvement. He has gone beyond Earth's power and he wants to keep it that way.Major Ostrow dies in the movie after using the Krell Gateway to expand his mind, but in the book he does not do so rashly. He is detailed, at his own request, to watch over Morbius and Alta, while the captain makes the ship ready to rocket back to Earth with Morbius and Alta in tow -- even if they have to be tied and gagged. Doc takes the opportunity to expand his own mind slowly and safely over the course of the night while Morbius is in the hands of psychotropic medication that keeps him awake -- mostly because Morbius is afraid to sleep -- and blissfully drugged. Short bursts from the Gateway give Doc what Morbius missed when he was first exposed and lay in a coma for a night and a day -- knowledge. What Morbius has spent 20 years trying to achieve Doc gets in his safe short bursts of Gateway use. Doc understands what really destroyed the Krell and what is at the heart of the Force that has torn apart some of the ship's men. At least Hollywood left that part alone and got most of it right.It was Morbius's souped up Id that was sneaking out when he was asleep to tear the ship's men limb from limb and sabotaging their ability to contact Earth. That monster of the unconscious mind no longer ruled by social convention or reason and fueled by the unlimited power of the Krell furnaces is determined to keep Earth from knowing what Morbius has done and wishes to continue doing -- create life.There it is, the reason behind Morbius's furtive actions and his warning to stay away from the planet or be destroyed by the Force. (This is a different Force from the Force that a Jedi uses, although it could be a taste of what perverted Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader, but that's another story altogether and happened much, much later.)Alta's friends are Morbius's attempt to create life, life that when dissected could not live. The vital organs are missing and what is left between what organs are part of the animal's makeup is a kind of stringy gelatinous mass like bloody stuffing. Remember, Morbius is not a biologist for a philologist, a scientist of words and languages. He has probably the most basic knowledge about how life is put together and thus he fills in the blanks in his knowledge with the bloody stuffing. It is unlikely that the animals even eat and certainly couldn't procreate since that would take a more profound understanding of biology than Morbius possesses.In the book, Alta tells Captain Adams that her friends just appeared one day when she was a child and had been there ever since. Animals that do not age or proecreate or kill for food or grow old and die, but what a life is the absence of true life. Life means growth and change and inevitably death. Morbius hasn't gotten that right yet.The book is a good one and I recommend it for fans of the movie and for fans of science fiction.While I enjoy the movie still, I find myself looking for clues in what Hollywood decided should be on the screen for what was central to the book. Morbius confronts his monster at the end and Doc does die, but Doc dies of exhaustion and not from a single blast of using the Gateway. Doc was much smarter than that. Morbius is alive and still on his feet at the end of the book. He sets the self-destruct sequence and choose to go down with the planet while Captain Adams and what remains of his crew fly away with Robby the robot and Alta, thus destroying the might and power of the Krell and their drive to create life that killed them -- and Morbius -- in the end.While the idea of creating life without a god's sanction might have been anathema to the mind in 1956, it is all too familiar in the 21st century where life can be -- and has been -- created in a test tube and the technique for cloning and growing human cells in Petri dishes and test tubes. Modern scientists regularly create life from retroviruses and lethal strains of bacteria to used as weapons to cloned sheep and very like humans as well as growing skin for burn victims. I wonder how far we are from creating a furnace powered by the heart of this planet that will fuel the dreams and nightmares of our collective Ids and Egos and end our race in a night and a day. Moreover, I wonder if that is what happened to Atlantis. Did Atlantean scientists tap too deep into the Earth's core to fuel their experiments with creating life and awaken the volcano on their island to their destruction? Who knows? Not all such scientific imaginings are the realm of fiction."	5.0	Disney effects and Hollywood-ized story	2013-07-18	3	3	0

Upon arrival, the crew of the ship learn that there is only one survivor of the original party, a Dr. Morbius. To keep him company, he has his daughter and a robot he built. To occupy his time, he studies the vanished civilization that one lived on the planet and builds miraculous devices such as the robot.Needless to say, the crew is a bit perturbed by Morbius's account of the deaths of the rest of his party. They were all violently killed by a strange beast who has not appeared in 20 years. The beast does re-appear, though, and starts to pick off members of the ship's crew. There is very limited time to figure out what is going on before all are dead. The secret lies within themselves.As with most such productions of this age, the science is laughable.

My DVD copy is good but showed a lot of grain when upscaled to 1080P, a problem I notice with older films. Newer or remastered/restored films don't have this problem or at least the graininess is not as noticable. I decided to purchase the Blu-ray version. Considering the age of the film, let me state I am very pleased to say the visual quality is a BIG improvement as some reviewers have noted here. There is some grain present but that's to be expected for an old film as another reviewer commented but it's not as obtrusive as before.I highly recommend this upgrade at such a good price.

Three other films which belong in its company is the original version of The Fly, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and The Time Machine.All of these films deal with variations on the ""Copernican"" theme of seeing the earth as a speck of dust in the cosmos.  But they do so in a way full of human drama; they explore the struggle and crises faced by individual human beings as they come into contact with and/or to terms with some ""truth"" which is larger than human life.  The Incredible Shrinking Man of the same period, and Altered States, from the `80s, might be reckoned in the same tradition.Yet Forbidden Planet outdoes them all from a sci-fi point of view.  This is the story of an alien race whose state of ultimate technology outlives the race itself, and of a handful of deep space explorers from earth who gradually come to realize, both by carefully studying the alien artifacts, and from their own interpersonal exchanges, that this is destiny of humanity as well.  This is not, however, a story about technology turning on its creators, as dealt with in a good number of other films.  This film pursues its theme without technology in any way becoming the bad guy or the bogey man.  The plot is far more subtle, and far more powerful.  In fact, there are no villains in this film, at least not in any conventional sense.  There are no cowboys and Indians here, mechanical or otherwise.The unique special effects and musical score make this film a special treat.  They captivate the imagination in a way that really does justice to its plot.  Especially memorable is the film's rendition of a piece of recorded music left behind by the alien race, the mood of which echoes through the entire sound track-though the music only lasts a minute or so.  Also memorable are the visual shots of seemingly ant-sized human beings as they explore the inner world of the great machines, where arcs of electricity the size of lightning bolts are incidental parts of its routine maintenance (reducing lightning to the status of a little static cling being automatically discharged).A must see for sci fi fans; thoughtful and fun for any viewer."	5.0	'after a million years of shining sanity, they could hardly have understood what power was destroying them'	2006-02-19	9	9	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	Amazon.com's reviewer's excellent review of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; covers all the bases about this superlative science fiction film; my own review can't be nearly as thoughtful. Surely &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; inspired the great space operas which followed in the 1960's and beyond, from &quot;Star Trek&quot; to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, and indeed, &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Leslie Nielsen's Commander J. J. Adams is clearly the archetype for Captain James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. His relationship with the ship's doctor, Lieutenant &quot;Doc&quot; Ostrow (Warren Stevens - who later appeared on a classic &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode.) clearly presages Kirk's relationship with Dr. McCoy. This science fiction adaptation of Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot; may not have the same literary quality as its predecessor, but it is nonetheless a spellbinding tale about a mad scientist whose uncontrolled emotions wreaks havoc on his adopted planet and Commander Adams' starship. Walter Pidgeon is spectacular as Dr. Mobius, the film's version of Prospero; both Nielsen and Warren are fine as the ship's captain and doctor, respectively. The soundtrack with its theremin score is widely regarded as a classic of science fiction music. Without question, this film is an absolute must for fans of science fiction cinema.	5.0	One Of The Great Science Fiction Films Of All Time	2001-11-26	3	2	1

The 1956 movie &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; was as much a step forward in special effects in its day as  &quot;2001&quot; in 1968 and &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 1978.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1QZUJ5QAZADF2	John M. Damico	Forbidden Planet is undisputibly a science fiction classic. It was one of the original three films that single handedly redifined the genre in the pivital '50s(the other two being The Day the Earth Stood Still and The War of the Worlds) by showing an intelligent, relatively plausible plot and effects to match. It did to sci-fi what had been done to horror in the 1930s by Frankenstein and the Universal monsters by taking the public out of the Flash Gordon gutter.  It also introduced the world to Robby the Robot, a classic character who has shown up in many other films and TV series since, helping F.P. achieve its cult classic status. The film itself is pretty simple. A crew of astronauts of the 23rd century are sent to investigate the silence from a planet inhabited by scientists, he finds all but two have died. Dr. Morbius and his daughter Altaira have somehow survived a hideous Monster From The Id which roams the planet. As corny as that sounds, it is handled like The Godfather. The character are excellent as well. Walter Pidgeon is great as the scientist Morbius and Captain Adams (Leslie Neilson in an unbelievably serious role) odviously inspires Star Trek's Kirk.

Fans of classic SF films probably already have it by now -- but if you don't, then get it at once.The film features an extremely pre-_Naked Gun_ Leslie Nielsen as Captain J.J. Adams and the great Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius in what amounts to a space-age recasting of _The Tempest_. Any viewer of the original _Star Trek_ will recognize both the plot and the production values: the Mad Scientist and his Beautiful Daughter are the sole survivors of a human mission to Altair 4, where everybody else has been killed by a strange, alien power into which the Mad Scientist has managed to tap . . .This film pretty much set the standard for what starship crews were supposed to look like. It also featured the very first all-electronic score in motion picture history. And of course there's Robby, the robot who was so obviously the model for the one in _Lost in Space_.Don't miss this one. It's not just your typical 1950s SF thriller; for its time, its special effects were on the cutting edge and its plot was fairly ambitious.	5.0	A restored classic	2003-12-27	6	6	0

It's a little boring for me to consider a must have classic, but I can see how this film can appeal to people on different levels. I'm more of a Plan 9 from Outer Space guy myself.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2D9IEFJGB483Q	Kendal B. Hunter	"There are three sci-fi film essentials: Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis,""  ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" and ""Forbidden Planet.""  There three films defined science fiction, as we know it today.  ""Forbidden Planet,"" for example, is the father of the Star Trek franchise, and the sets provided the basis for ""Lost in Space.""  And look at all of Robby the Robots grandchildren!This film is a science fiction rewrite of  ""The Tempest,"" which helps explain its sticking power.  It has the rescue vessel, the mad scientist, and the alien mysteries, all of which capture your interest and never let you go. IT has elements of a murder mystery, with hilarious subplots about a nave young girl and hungry boys lucked up in psace for a year.  IS it 1950's cheese?  Yes, but it is fun to watch.The killer is an invisible villain.  Aside from being cheaper, this builds the suspense to an incredible level.  Come on-you see ""Alien"" and you see a lanky guy in a rubber suit. But an invisible villain lets your imagination run wild, which can be wilder than anything Hollywood can ever make.The situation of a scientific-research vessel that discovers now life and new civilization provides the pattern for Star Trek:  the main characters being the Captain, the ship's doctor and the engineer interacting.  Leslie Neilson has the same soul as William Shatner.  For good or bad, there is no Star Trek equivalent of Robby the Robot, unless you count Mr. Spock.  But I digress.Another observation is Altair's insidious wardrobe changing, which preempts Queen Amildala by five decades.  Walter Pidgeon gives a masterful performance, and steals the show.  So many mad scientists are flat and soulless-they are even passionless went it comes to their passions in science.  But Pidgeon breathes life in what could have been a cheesy 1950's science fiction throwaway.The costuming and sets are superb.  True this is 1950, so some of the sets look like they were done with Crayolas, but can any ""cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?""  The doorways in the film give you the weird impression of alien civilization. The lab and Krell building blow your mind with all of the gizmos. Nothing specific, but the overall atmosphere suggests things alien.  I wonder if they actually had an image of the Krell, or if they just made it up as they went along the image you see haloed in laser-fire may be a Krell, or may be the Krell equivalent of a Frankenstein's monster.  The plaster cast of the monster's foot suggests that the monster is an imaginary composite, but we will never know. By the way, the idea that a civilization would not have pictures is not weird ay all-Islamic art does not allow for graven images to be made, so they focus on Arabic calligraphy.  .The soundtrack is theremin based-the eerie ""oooh""-making machine from the Beach Boy's song ""Good Vibrations.""  It adds to the weirdness of the movie, and is comparable to the soundtrack in the 1981 remake of  ""Flash Gordon.""  Most experimental soundtracks flop, but this comes off perfectly, since it is suggested that the music we a re listening to is actually Krell music.The DVD is an annoying two-sided disc with letterbox and ""pan and scan"" on each side.  People-Wide screen, wide screen, wide screen!Two parting thoughts:First, at the heart of this movie is a psycho-thriller that brings your mind to the edge as you are forced to look at yourself.  We have the technology and the power to be gods, but can we stand it if in our hearts, we are devils?  Look at this war we are fighting.Second, if this film seems familiar, it is because everyone has ripped it off.

The extras included are nice, including a complete second feature film &#34;The Invisible Boy&#34;, and several extras from the original.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A67MP5A2MQKZP	"Kenneth Keller ""solarwind1"""	"There are now out *four* different versions of the 50th Anniversary edition of ""Forbidden Planet"": 2 standard (480i) DVD sets and 2 HD-DVD sets. Both formats are available as either a super-deluxe, Ultimate Collector's Edition set offered in a thick, green and red engraved hinged metal box, as well as a standard 2-disc sleeved set. Both come with lots extras, especially the metal Ultimate. I highly recommend them to everyone if you're so inclined toward lavish DVD sets. Being a longtime ""Forbidden Planet"" fan and collector, I'm planning on buying the other three variant sets, too, because, well, I'm obsessed with FP and by now have lost all sense of proportion when ""collecting"" this terrific film.The Ultimate Collector's Edition metal box set is described on its' outer, partial card stock cover--and be careful when removing this as it's tricky and can be easily torn--as being made of a ""unique metal alloy."" (Hmm. Indestructible Krell metal perhaps???) Frankly, this deluxe set is everything I had hoped it would be, though I do have some quibble(see below). Overall, though, it's a beautiful package. One of the best super-deluxe DVD sets ever produced. It even includes a proper *gunmetal gray* 3.5"" Robby (not black, as some supposed ""film experts"" have asserted for years) and a set of smallish FP lobby card reproductions in a printed sleeve. As an extra bonus for this release, you also get Robby's other 50s science fiction film ""The Invisible Boy"" and a set of smallish lobby card repros for it, too.At last this science fiction masterpiece (classic just isn't good enough) has gotten the super-deluxe treatment--and complete digital restoration--it has long deserved. The digital picture and 5.1 sound are a marvel. FP has never looked or sounded this good--ever! I've seen FP on the big CinemaScope screen a half a dozen times in the last 50 years, including a very nice 50th Anniversary revival house print. Plus, I have all the earlier video/laserdisc/DVD releases. I went over to a neighbor's home the evening I purchased this set (11-9-06) and watched a portion of this new digital remastering in 480p (progressive scan) on a 1-year old, 50"" plasma display home theatre set-up. It was to die for. *TILT!* Even on my standard ratio 480i home theatre it looks spectacular. I can't imagine that FP could be much better looking in the new HD-DVD format. Let's face it, you can only push the film stock of a 50-year old CinemaScope print just so far, even when reformatting from a fine-grain vault print.While you can currently order these DVDs cheaper here, at least for the present, I decided to pay $10.00 more locally ($49.95, which included tax) for an early release just so I could have it *Right Now* and also so I could insure getting a pristine, undamaged, set. (I've had shipping/packing damage problems to the sides/edges when ordering other deluxe metal DVD sets through the mail, notably the 1933 ""King Kong"" and Disney ""Tomorrowland"" releases).Of special note on this set are two new documentaries done especially for the 50th Anniversary release: ""Amazing! Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet"" and ""Robby the Robot: Engineering a Sci-Fi Icon."" They're worth the price of this set alone, IMO. Very nicely done.My only disappointment--and I consider it a major oversight that the material was left out--is that virtually all of the supplementary material originally included on Criterion's 1989 two-disc (CAV) laserdisc release is not here. Especially MGM's original ""Fatal Planet"" screen treatment that clearly showed that FP started out as just another B-grade, bottom-of-the-bill programmer and then evolved into to a first-rate A production. However, scenes (and partial scenes) originally edited out of FP (taken from Louis and Bebe Barron's surviving original film score work print) are included in this new set as an extra. In fact, to my eye, it looks like the Criterion masters were used for this DVD transfer. For most this will be the first time these ""lost"" scenes will be seen. So I'm now planning on having the rest of that important ""Making of Forbidden Planet"" laserdisc material burned on to a DVD-R and then simply include it my copy of this new release.Frankly, I wouldn't have missed the extra ""The Invisible Boy"" feature that's also here, though it's obvious why it was offered in the set; or even the inaccurate 3.5"" Robby miniature included--the shape of his head/carapace is wrong (too fat), among other detail problems. But that's just me. I have every confidence that this Ultimate Collector's Eition will receive high marks from both reviewers and fellow ""Forbidden Planet"" aficionados everywhere.BTW, for those that might not have seen them, issues #97 and #98 (from 2003 and still available from the publisher) of the long-running film magazine FilmFax contain an authoritative two-part article: ""The Making of Forbidden Planet."" Both come highly recommended. This two-part article is similar in scope to the famous 20-year old ""Forbidden Planet"" double-issue of Cinefantastique (CFQ). While it duplicates some of the same material, there's enough new/different material in these two FilmFax issues to make acquiring them worthwhile. All three magazines taken together give an extremely thorough history of FP's creation and production. I would also refer you to another recent issue of FilmFax, #108 (#112 is the current issue out as I post this.) It contains an authoritative article on the restoration of the original Robby the Robot to his original form, done for his owner Bill Malone, by Fred Barton whose company makes a full-sized, fully articulated (and very $$$!) 1-to-1 Robby reproduction. (There's an ad flyer insert for Barton's Robby included with this new FP release.) Both Malone and Barton, with their Robbies, are seen throughout the two DVD documentaries mentioned above."	5.0	"""Classic"" Trek's Original Inspiration Finally Gets the Deluxe Treatment It Deserves"	2006-11-13	125	113	12

That's a shame.Many people have pointed out how far ahead of its time this movie was.  That is an understatement.  Clearly, the  propulsion method and overall handling of star travel inspired Rodenberry  for Star Trek.  It would be easy to imagine cruiser C57D being an early,  pre-Federation warp ship.This is the first movie that I'm aware of  that treated the breaking of lightspeed as a very big deal.  Both  superluminal travel and communications is treated as a very significant  issue that physics of the future could deal with, but not easily.  Most  movies of the time, and much later, had star travel with rockets.This  movie begs for a sequel or prequel.  Harlan Ellison mentioned a few years  ago that a group was shopping the idea around, but it turned out to only be  an idea of a remake.  Bummer.  Imagine seeing the Krell as they build their  great machine and then hell night, or imagine Robby running around 22nd  century Earth, maybe throw in an encounter with a Krell colony that  survived and is about to reinvent the same thought/matter machine.Until  then, I'll keep checking out the original.	5.0	One of the Greatest Sci-Fi movies ever made	1999-11-06	10	10	0

The ""special effects"" made use of -- may be ""primitive"" and ""lo-tech"" versus ""advanced hi-tech"" 21st century FX -- but in usage are just fine to express the effects needed to carry the great plot. The actors and acting are grand-old-supurb-vintage as well. I can easily see why Anne Francis is still remembered -- she appears with smooth curves and beauty very much like the first Barbie dolls -- but she is lively, animated and expressive as well. Well-paced ongoing drama occurs as the plot jogs along at a good but not rushed pace. I especially like the color-and-shade balance-and-contrast of the scenes and scenery -- russet-and-golds versus silver-and-blues for example. The matte-painting is so well-done -- that somehow a 3D background and foreground is well-rendered -- despite what must be ever-present painted 2D subscenes. The out-of-this-world electronic-music and sound-effects all thru the movie are wonderful -- way futuristic -- as are the settings with their alien shapes and curves -- even when [barely apparent] 1950s-projected ""hi-tech"" is used. It is all done so well that it is still quite ""alien hi-tech"" seeming -- even now. What could seem dated -- seems rather to fit-in with the whole movie.  This movie is only matched by a few other sci-fi greats from its time -- such as ""It Came from Outer Space"" [1953] and ""The War of the Worlds"" [1953] -- which have comparable classic virtues.

However, with a larger budget than Star Trek would eventually have, it has much more in the way of bells and whistles.It has a Captain, a fair maiden, a stately scientist, a cadre of astronauts (who really act like WWII Navy men right down to the stereotypically undisciplined &quot;cook&quot; character,) a mysterious robot with unknown intentions, and a force that that threatens to destroy them all.This is one of the few science fiction films from the Fifties that is both entertaining AND intelligent.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1KT1GWCW8F80	K. Gittins	"There are a handful of 1950's sci-fi movies that have a big reputation - ""When Worlds Collide"", ""The Thing From Another World"", ""Forbidden Planet"", and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". Unfortunately, only ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" really stands up (except the robot).This movie has big concepts, and none of them work anymore, if they ever did. Part thriller, part drama, part mad-scientist melodrama. There are just too many things going on, and all of them ""supposedly"" explained in long-winded speeches that answer nothing.""Forbidden Planet"" starts off looking much like Star Trek TOS, including the transporter. In reality, ST:TOS creator Gene Roddenberry admits this movie formed part of the basis for Star Trek. In a nutshell, a United Planets space cruiser captained by Leslie Nielsen lands on Altair, against the wishes of its inhabitant, Dr. Morbius, a remnant from a previous expedition. He and his 25 year old daughter (Anne Francis) are the only humans on the planet. There is also a robot called ""Robbie"", of course, similar to that of the ""Lost in Space"" series. The doctor reluctantly shows the others his discovery about an ancient extinct race called the Krell. The ""big"" ending is too weird and funny to be described.The entire robot aspect and the tasks he performs is just silly (in the ""Lost In Space"" vein). Earl Holliman's character of ""Cookie"" was put in for comedic effect - unfortunately most has to do with his dealings with the robot - including getting the robot to make bourbon - which only adds to the silliness.The actors are quite serious and for the most part are OK. Leslie Nielsen plays it straight. Anne Francis is entertaining as the daughter who is initially somewhat innocent and ignorant of sex. As might be guessed, the captain ends up with her.The sets are incredibly hokey. The all-electronic score does not help. Ambitious, atrociously fake special effects that probably were OK in 1956. Possibly the goofiest sci-fi movie ever. Don't get me wrong - this is a well-made and well-intentioned movie, but as with ""When Worlds Collide"" and ""The Thing..."", it is recommended only for a laugh.A further insult is that the robot is not accurately depicted on the DVD cover and he never holds anyone in his arms."	2.0	"""Civilization without instrumentalities?"""	2004-06-19	31	3	28

The movie is the first time the world saw the Robbie Robot character, the same robot give or take a few spare parts from Lost in Space. The crew of the space ship was a complete crew even down to a cook. Laser shooters were used in this movie as well, a Hollywood first. That being said it did have some flaws; the characters were all one dimensional. The story went no where at times. Such as the time where the cook got the robot to synthesize bourbon. Yes some of the plot just seemed like filler. I really got the feeling that Dr. Morbius was based on Captain Nemo from 20000 leagues Jules Verne story. The way how he gave the tour of his world and machinery just seemed so familiar to the 20000 leagues story. Overall this is a fine transfer to DVD, and has quite extras on this DVD package.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AGKPTMTR3UX1R	"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here"""	"Fifty years after its theatrical release FORBIDDEN PLANET still ranks as one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever created. Of it's contemporaries, only 1951's THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL approaches its intelligence and depth. Not until Stanley Kubrick brought us 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was another science-fiction film to take such a thought-provoking approach to the human condition.Much of the credit for the excellence of FORBIDDEN PLANET has to go to its ultimate source material, THE TEMPEST, Shakespeare's last (and arguably greatest) play.A number of reviewers have mentioned ""some Shakespear play"" (sic) as the inspiration for this film, and others have admitted, ""I haven't read it."" I strongly recommend that anyone even mildly interested in FORBIDDEN PLANET read THE TEMPEST, and secondarily, that anyone who speaks English acquaint themselves with the Bard of Avon (that's Shakespeare, in case you didn't know...at the very least spell his name correctly!)The film stars Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius (Prospero), Anne Francis as his daughter Altaira (Miranda), Robby the Robot as himself (Ariel), and the Invisible Monster From the Id in the Caliban role.The Forbidden Planet is visited by the crew of the spaceship C-57-D, captained by a very young, very earnest Leslie Nielsen. He is accompanied by his First Officer and Ship's Doctor with whom he trades constant wisecracks (if this all sounds familiar, it's because FORBIDDEN PLANET counts STAR TREK as one of its numerous progeny). FORBIDDEN PLANET's plot also inspired more than one episode of that show.The Robot of LOST IN SPACE owes his existence to Robby the Robot (who later appeared in other pictures besides FORBIDDEN PLANET, a groundbreaking idea at the time). LOST IN SPACE's Jupiter II is a copy of the C-57-D. STAR TREK and LOST IN SPACE were both produced within a decade of FORBIDDEN PLANET, and their creators have credited the film as seminal.C-57-D is searching for survivors of a human colony on the planet. As it turns out, the only survivors are the imperious Dr. Morbius, his irresistibly sexy and utterly innocent twentysomething daughter, Altaira, and Robby the Robot.Morbius informs them that all is fine on the Forbidden Planet and bades them go on their way. Suspicious for no particular reason, the Captain and his pals decide to overstay their welcome. In recounting the history of the planet, Morbius explains that it was once the home of a superintellectual race called the Krell, and that the Krell were destroyed by some unknown force at the very height of their powers. After having the Captain stick his feet in the fire, Morbius admits that the rest of the colonists died as a result of contact with this unknown force. The words are barely out of Morbius' mouth when the crew of C-57-D reports several mysterious deaths.Most of the rest of the film revolves around efforts to battle what turns out to be an invisible monster bent on mindless destruction. The origins of the monster cause one to consider the conundrum of the atomic age: whether a mankind bent on technological advancement is better off than a mankind that lived in a simpler time.FORBIDDEN PLANET never lags. The script is well-honed, and the story moves along at a rapid clip (even for 1956), always keeping the viewer's attention.The dialogue is furiously funny at times. Besides the ongoing byplay between the Captain and his cronies, Earl Holliman hams it up as the ship's often-inebriated cook, who strikes up a satisfyingly one-sided business relationship with Robby the Robot. Altaira is gently amusing. Never having met any man besides her father, she is wide-eyed and curious about the visitors. After the men lead her in some discussion on the subject, she decides she just MUST practice her kissing, a task for which the dedicated crew volunteers at every available moment thereafter.The very attractive Anne Francis (TV's HONEY WEST) is fitted out in some criminally short minidresses which are slam-dunk guaranteed to hold the attention of a typical heterosexual male viewer. A few of her dresses were banned by studio censors as being too much (or too little) and were not used in the film. Her wardrobe definitely gave impetus to the female crew uniforms on STAR TREK. The actual costumes in this movie were later used in the less-than-memorable low-budget QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE, starring Zsa Zsa Gabor as a Venusian woman with a Budapest accent (!). A practice kissing sequence also made it into that film.Miss Francis is the acknowledged original ""Space Babe."" Though Altaira is essentially a sex kitten role, she manages to imbue the character with dignity and humor, and gives a memorable performance.The sets are all posh and wonderfully futuristic (in a 1950s Swedish modern sort of way). The special effects were cutting-edge for their time. MGM spared no expense in producing this big-budget color picture and hired Disney Studios to create the effects. (Yes, they look rather dated now, but considering they are fifty years old, they hold up surprisingly well against today's CGI.) The electronic soundtrack is still a definite attention-getter.With its balanced mix of science fiction, comedy, and classic drama, FORBIDDEN PLANET stands as one of the finest movies ever made."	5.0	"""For Thou Wast A Spirit Too Delicate..."""	2005-06-20	25	23	2

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AC3BYMWHHCD2L	Larry Gilstrap	Where to begin?  On a personal note, this film was the first science fiction (and horror) movie I saw as a little kid.  It both fascinated and scared the daylights out of me, making several lasting impressions during the brief hour-and-a-half viewing time, sparking interests in science, space, and psychology, as well as posing questions of our ultimate goals as individuals and a species.While this classic of sci-fi cinema may be unknown to the last three generations, but it is well known to movie makers over the past fifty years or more - including the likes of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Gene Roddenberry, and John Carpenter, to name a few .  And while it may appear quaint and dated by current standards, the fundamental issues and tensions are still every bit as potent in provoking thought and delighting us with unique glimpses into the human enterprise.SPOILER ALERTThe monster in the film, is a materially amplified projection of the old man's baser, animal nature.  This provides the troubling, if not delectable irony that the monsters we find in space may well be the one's we bring with us, as inseparable companions in our journey among the stars.And this notion, in turn raises another point - What do we hope to achieve as human beings?  What is gained by venturing beyond the sky, if ultimately, all we find is ourselves staring back at us?So much for the future.  Returning to the personal pleasures I've found in watching, and re-watching, this movie countless times since that first viewing in the early 1960's, I greatly enjoy the 1950's-ish interplay and expressions of the men and woman (Anne Francis) in the movie.  The women of that era had a knack for expressing paragraphs of unspoken thoughts with a simple &#34;Oh.&#34;  Perhaps such is still true of today's women, but I delight in memories of those first women I know way back when.The extra features on the Blu-Ray version are well worth watching.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1YB113MEH7IR4	Lauren G	This is said to be the firsts big-budget SF film ever made.  It is loosely based on Shakespeare's &#34;The Tempest&#34; which is loosely based on a shipwreck in the Caribbean shortly after the invasion of the Western Hemisphere by the Europeans.It is the source of many SF tropes, such as the Transporter in Star Trek.It is a cautionary tale abut hubris and the dangers of the unconscious.

I am no fan of the Robby trinket, my cat could eat that sucker in one gulp, and the piece of tin this thing is housed in shows a real lack of TLC. I suppose if one is a fan he/she might like the lobby cards, but they are essentially useless. The fact that there is no audio commentary bites the big one. At least have an older guy on there running his mouth about how good-looking Anne Francis is, something--that's the kind of stuff we're paying for here! The extras are fine otherwise, including the &#34;Keep Watching the Skies&#34; documentary. Picture is clear, very much remastered to these eyes (better than the old MGM VHS cassette tape) and the sound will kick your biscuits if you put it through a good stereo system. But, seriously, tally your nerd quotient before you shell out the farthings for this sub-par glorified cereal box edition.&#34;Forbidden Planet&#34; is really not a very good movie, and that's something that you will never hear from the mouths of big money dollars like George Lucas and Phil Tippet. The plot drags, the acting is 50s in a dangerous sense, the &#34;clever&#34; stuff about the sub-conscious pretty much removes this film entirely from the fantasy genre, and the set designs were constructed in an ex-auto worker's backyard. Someone thought it would be clever to have a monster from someone's id show up, but...no, it's not! I seriously don't understand the cult that surrounds this movie--it's a glorified episode of &#34;Lost in Space,&#34; not scary, not hip, and not even close to being sexy (sorry Anne, you were hot enough for the day). The film has a semi-Christian agenda, and would probably have its characters scoff at the reality of evolutionary biology--the politics are clear cut and conservative from the very beginning. Needless to say, this is not science fiction! I have been having many bouts of quiet laughter thinking about poor Del Toro trying to get the big-butt version of &#34;At the Mountains of Madness&#34; off the ground, knowing that &#34;The Thing&#34; exists very strongly in the public consciousness and that he'll have to bat his wings against the wind wishing that that other film didn't exist (but it does). The same developmental problems plague old Strazcynsky as he struggles to explain to studios how wonderful it would be to explain the backstory of the Krell race to modern audiences--but he understands that the attention span of modern audiences is as long as the latest pop single. We are no longer in the business of making science fiction films guys--we have no lost races, no criticism of humanity, no &#34;offensive&#34; stories that question the sovereignty of both God and Man. Films like &#34;Gravity&#34; (2013) illustrate my point--these older sf movies used to be about discovering alien societies, burrowing underground, discovering monstrous beasts that seek to punish us, discovering more about our humanity by starting to get away from it and get some perspective. We are cursed with the need for realism at the Cineplex, which really defeats the purpose of movies anyway. NOT that &#34;Forbidden Planet&#34; is a good example of a great escapist sf movie.I am giving this heap one extra star because &#34;The Invisible Boy&#34; is included here, which is a film worth a few cheap laughs, but otherwise this is a lot of hype and hoopla over nuttin'. I hope you have a copy of &#34;Alien&#34; lying around so you can wash this attempt out of your mind and see how imaginative science fiction settings are supposed to be built.	2.0	Bring home a piece of tin!

The only possible competition for this movie would be The Day the Earth Stood Still, which is also dynamite, and is also copied after a famous book--the New Testament.  But comparing the two, I'd have to give the nod to Forbidden Planet, at least for the special effects, especially Robby, although I couldn't argue with anyone who preferred TDTESS.

(In fact, I remember back in the early 1990's when DVDs first started appearing in stores, and Forbidden Planet was one of the very first movies to go onto DVD.)I ordered this 50th anniversary edition as quickly as I could move my mouse and type, but it took me a few months to actually get around to watching it.I've seen this movie many times.  What I really was looking forward to was the bonus material that came with the movie.  All I can say is that the bonus features made it worth the price of purchasing the DVD set.First, the Additional Scenes are priceless.  I'd actually seen them before because I own the Criterion Collection laser disc (retailed for $100 ten years ago), but I don't have a laser disc player, so I finally got to see these scenes again on a media I can play whenever I want.  Cool!Second the ""Lost Footage"" is just about as priceless as the deleted scenes.  There's even an alternate introductory narrative where you hear the words ""planet"" and ""federation"" used together almost ten years before those words became legendary.The Excerpts from The MGM Parade TV Series are basically Walter Pidgeon advertising the movie at the end of this TV show.  Short, but can anything with Walter Pidgeon not be great?The All-new Amazing! Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet"" featurette is a rather good documentary.  I just wish it had been longer, but that's the way it goes.  Ann Francis looks amazingly good even to this day.The Robby the Robot: Engineering a Sci-Fi Icon was an unexpected surprise and very entertaining.  No, it's not the Lost in Space robot.  It's a different robot.  In fact, there's an episode of Lost in Space where both robots appear together.  I wish this documentary had shown us all the places where Robby appeared through the years.  Robby was in an original Twilight Zone episode (as were many of the props from Forbidden Planet) but no mention was made of this.So, the worst thing I can say about the documentaries is that there could have been more, but at least they're there.The TCM documentary Watch the Skies!: Science Fiction, the 1950s and Us seemed like filler, but at least it puts Forbidden Planet in its historical context and illustrates just what a revolutionary movie it was.The Invisible Boy is a barely watchable (unless you just love Mystery Science Theater type corny sci-fi) movie that features the same robot coincidentally (yeah right) named Robby.  In this movie, Robby is evil, and the boy is about the most loathsome and unlikeable boy ever to star in any sci-fi movie I've seen.  I watched this movie on my flat panel TV during a treadmill workout, so at least I didn't waste any time.  If you want to see Robby do evil things and speak with a bad voice, watch this.I haven't watched the Thin Man TV Series Robot Client episode yet.So, there's an overview of the bonus features.  I hope it helps your purchase decision."	5.0	Here's a review of the bonus features.	2005-10-23	1	1	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1NFV45J3MCC4E	Lightning Surfer	"A tremendous science fiction film!  By the way, its influence can be clearly seen on the television shows ""Star Trek"" (1966-1969) and ""Lost In Space"" (1965-1968).  The plot?  A rescue mission on a distant planet turns dangerous when a mysterious being attacks an entire flight crew.  Take note - there is plenty to praise here.  First, director Fred McLeod Wilcox is able to balance the cerebral themes with occasional humor and old fashioned romance, so that the movie remains above all else entertaining.  Second, this production makes terrific use of matte paintings and a large cyclorama to illustrate the planet landscape of Altair IV.  A similar technique was used in Stanley Kubrick's ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"" (1968) to great effect.  Lastly, how about that trailblazing soundtrack?  The composing couple of Louis and Bebe Barron brought forth here the first electronic music score to a mainstream film.  Who would have thought to build electronic circuits to make strange noises?  Their music was groundbreaking and innovative.  The eerie sounds have such character and give this flick a unique personality.  All that said, ""Forbidden Planet"" is a smart mystery that excels in adventure and wonder.  {It is also the complete package on blu-ray with handsome video, amazing audio and a plethora of extra features, which includes the outstanding documentary called ""Watch The Skies!

The dialogue is surprisingly well-written and poetic, though like the plot it is jaw-droppingly sexist (it was 1956, after all).

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	"I found this film tremendously entertaining and even enthralling when I first saw it as a teenager. It's held up surprisingly well for me over the years, and not all for nostalgic and sentimental reasons. The movie combines many intriguing themes and elements--the mystery of an advanced but vanished race, attacks by an unseen force, some very cool special effects, the ravishing Ann Francis, and considering it was ""just"" a low budget B movie, a pretty stellar cast with Walter Pidgeon, Leslie Nielson, and as I said Ann Francis--to produce one of the great B sci-fi movies of the period, and one which really transcends the modest pretentions of that oft-maligned genre. And last but not least, the scene with the I.Q. measuring machine even pokes fun at the captain. :-)Then there was Robbie the robot, who went on to appear in several other venues (including a very corny Lost in Space episode some years later, but I guess Robbie's career was on the skids by that time :-)). The movie's climax is exciting as well as different from the other sci-fi movies of the day, but I won't say anything further on that so as not to provide any spoilers, except to say that it had more do to with inner space than outer space. And finally, the energy ray gun and the flying saucer spaceship are two very cool special effects. All in all still a great classic from the golden age of B science fiction movies and still worth watching today."	5.0	Old classic still worth watching	2007-02-28	1	1	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2FFYQZPUGOX58	Magnifying Glass	"If you already have a DVD of ""Forbidden Planet,"" should you buy the Blu-ray version?I have watched the DVD version of this many times; it is the ""50th Anniversary Two-Disc Special Edition.""  I consider its picture quality as excellent (4).The picture quality for the Blu-ray version is the same.  When watching it, there were moments when I thought it might show a tiny bit more detail.  To make this an objective evaluation of its resolution versus the older DVD version, I picked out two scenes with difficult-to-resolve detail.In Dr. Morbius's study there is a blackboard.  Upon it he has chalked a diagram of the enigmatic pointed arches, Einstein's famous energy equation, other equations with possibly alien mathematical operators and symbols, and a drawing of the celestial sphere marking altitude and azimuth of something.  On this last item, there is a word written in capitol letters:  on the DVD, it is unreadable;  on the Blu-ray, it reads, ""EQUINOCTIAL"".In the chamber with the plastic educator, there are several blue panels in the distant background behind the educator.  In the scene where Doc Ostrow is seated at the educator:  on the DVD, the panels have no detail;  on the Blu-ray, the panels are perforated like a pegboard.If you want the best possible resolution, then this Blu-ray is it; however, since the differences are so minute, I suspect most will be satisfied with their DVD version.Overall, this movie is outstanding (5).  Its story has mystery and an ample supply of wonder.  Visually, the scenes on the surface of Altair-4 are believably alien.

Forbidden Planet is a great movie, retelling Shakespeare's The Tempest in the Sci-Fi genre. Relief ship from Earth travels to a world to find two survivors of a colony settled over 20 years ago. An excellently arrogant Walter Pigeon has, through the use of alien technology, built for himself and his daughter, the beautiful Anne Francis, a virtual paradise, complete with robot servant and atomic-disposal. The ""rescue"" party, captained by a pre-silliness Leslie Nielsen disrupts the tranquility of their lives and unleashes the unseen monster which destroyed not only the other colonists, but also the alien civilization which had flourished here eons ago. The movie is still great 50 years after it was made. But this DVD is horrid. Being presented in a full screen format, in which the left or right side of scenes are cut off isn't even the worst of it. The quality of the picture is fuzzy and blurred. And as for extras? Forget it.

It scared the crap out of me, even though I had no idea what ""monsters from the id"" were, nor did I figure out at that young age that Dr Morbeus' thoughts were being transformed into the invisible monster that was killing everything in its path, even after viewing the picture a number of times.Needless to say, this film has been one of my favs for over 40 years. I've owned it on VHS, DVD and now, BD. The BD transfer is incredible, the best ever. It's better than the DVD, and the differences aren't at all subtle. It's really clear and crisp, with just the right amount of film grain that's typical of 1950s sci-fi fare.

I'd be hard pressed to name something better. Star Wars ranks up there, but this movie tops anything I have seen. It's a story about men, their limitations, their love, and their nature.The cinematography is great, and the special effects are almost epic for a movie from the fifties. We get to see a very young Leslie Neilson in a serious role and his performance alone is awesome. The plot comes together quite well at the end, and though you'll probably have some idea towards the end about the resolution of the movie, it's still very enjoyable.However, don't buy anything but a quality DVD or VHS copy of this. This VHS copy is full screen, and plays like a home dubbing. I'd recommend the DVD but the enhanced widescreen VHS edition is watchable.	5.0	Get it, but in DVD version	2003-04-26	1	1	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AAW58LG72PG7I	"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor"""	"When FORBIDDEN PLANET was released in 1956, science fiction films tended to be low budget black and white affairs that called to mind aliens attacking earth when Americans still recalled vividly GIs storming the beaches at Iwo Jima.  Director Fred Wilcox wanted to continue the very recent trend blazed by the slightly earlier THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD which similarly suggested that science fiction could reflect some serious subtexts.  Here, Wilcox took the essentials of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST and incorporated Walter Pidgeon in the Prospero role as Dr. Morbius, Anne Francis as Altaira (Miranda in THE TEMPEST), and the invisible monster from the ID as Caliban.  Moviegoers were immediately entranced for all the right reasons. Leslie Nielsen as the captain was properly heroic as the one who emerged as the most insightful of his crew despite his failing to register high on the Krell brain booster. It was he who directed his crew to defend their ship against the ID beast.  It was he who wound up with the lovely Altaira.  And it was he who determined how to defeat a creature that was deemed too impossible to exist.  Part of the allure of FORBIDDEN PLANET was the seamless melding of drama with comedy and ultimately with tragedy.  The drama lay in how the crew from earth could avoid being picked off one by one as the crew of the Bellerephon had been twenty years earlier. As did Shakespeare in many of his tragedies, FORBIDDEN PLANET has several moments of low comedy (mostly in the intonations of Robby the Robot interacting with the goofy Earl Holliman).  And the tragedy came not from the deaths of the crew but from the conversations of Dr. Morbius who sadly bemoaned the deaths of the technologically advanced Krell who in Morbius' words: ""Could hardly have known what was killing them."" Tying these three disparate elements into a cohesive whole was the Freudian subtext of the monsters from the ID.  Morbius refused to grant until the very end that even his beloved Krell could yet retain a semblance of human emotion that might damn them just as thoroughly as it did for Freud's patients. There is a telling scene at the end when Morbius finally realizes the ghastly truth that it was he who was responsible for reviving the ID beast.  He faces the beast and denounces it, all the while knowing that he can no more disavow it than he could disavow his own inner demons.  As he confronts it, the captain takes out his blaster and points it at Morbius, realizing that the only way to stop the beast was to kill Morbius.Even after watching FORBIDDEN PLANET numerous times over the decades, I can still eagerly view it with each viewing, much like one of Shakespeare's plays, revealing a new facet to enjoy.  The special effects, top notch as they are, are not what I take away from any viewing.  What brings me back again and again to the fold is the realization that what is normally forbidden for anyone to make use of is under the right circunstances a license for brutality that can overwhelm the best of anyone us, including even the godlike Krell."	5.0	Monsters From the Id	2008-11-01	1	0	1

I am a big science fiction aficionado, and a massive Star Trek fan in particular. Perhaps I had subconsciously lumped this film in with other 50's-era schlock. Well, I was in error to do so.As a Trek fanatic, it was fascinating to see a film from 1956 which was so obviously a huge inspiration for Gene Roddenberry's original series. So many aspects of this film find their way into Roddenberry's TV show:-a ""United Earth"" space vessel that travels faster than light-a transporter-like deceleration chamber,-the storyline of checking on a missing survey team-an ancient civilization that had evolved to the point of non-corporeal being-brain scanners which impart huge loads of information directly into the minds of the recipientThese are but a few of the similarities, the most impressive of which might be the tonal similarity: the sense of seriousness and wonder at space exploration, mixed with just enough humor and sex appeal to keep things moving breezily.But more than just a preview for the Star Trek show that would emerge a decade later, we also get a good story with a fine emotional core, adapted very loosely from Shakespeare's ""Tempest"" - a reclusive scientist (like Shakespeare's wizard), living on a secluded world with only his daughter for company, who fears losing her to visitors from far away. I won't spoil the secret we eventually learn about this scientist, but suffice it to say, it is an excellent science fiction concept which is well-fleshed out.The performances are all good, and the actors clearly took the material seriously. Particularly good are Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius, and Anne Francis as his daughter Alta. Leslie Nielsen cuts a fine figure as the square-jawed commander of the ship, too.The effects are also surprisingly good for a film of this day. Yes, we can tell with our modern eyes when optical effects, matte painted backdrops, and models are being used. But the level of execution in this definitely out-shines the original Star Trek TV series from a decade later, and was probably not surpassed in quality until Kubrick's ""2001"" in 1968. The set designs are also terrific, with extremely detailed props.Simply put, this is a seminal film, in the fullest possible sense of the word - it set an extremely high standard for the genre, and certainly gave birth to future greats like Star Trek. If you're a Trek fan, I consider this a must-own. If you're a student of the genre, this is equally necessary. But not only sci-fi nerds need apply - this is an interesting story with a lot of intelligence, but also a good amount of drama and heart. Just about anyone should be capable of being entertained by this - it's simply a good movie.The Blu-Ray:For a 54 year-old movie, this transfer is stunningly good. Warner Bros. has scored again with a classic film transfer. Detail is not as strong as some modern films, but there is a lovely sheen of film grain that never wavers. Colors and black levels are stable and strong throughout. And detail can be quite good at times. Certainly, no DVD could reach the levels of detail present here. Cloth textures can be quite lovely, and fine hair and facial wrinkle detail is evident. Alta's outfits are particularly nice to look at, with lots of fine cloth detail and sparkling jewels.What really impresses are the slate of extras, all included on one dual-layer Blu-Ray disc. We get a complete 90-minute second movie, the standard def, black and white film ""The Invisible Boy,"" featuring Robby the robot. A complete 25-minute episode of ""The Thin Man"" TV series is also included, featuring Robby. An hour-long (!) documentary from Turner Classic Movies delves into the culture of 50's sci-fi movies, with interviews of current sci-fi directors like Ridley Scott, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and James Cameron, and clips from dozens of contemporary 50's genre flicks. Then, we also get two featurettes, running 29 and 14 minutes respectively, looking at the production of the film and the construction of Robby the Robot. Some other vintage TV excerpts show Walter Pidgeon introducing Robbie to the home audience. 20 minutes of deleted scenes and ""lost footage"" rounds out a truly impressive collection of extras.Conclusion:I was impressed in every way imaginable by this release. The film stands up with classics like ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" and ""2001"" as genre must-owns. The Blu-Ray itself displays a superb quality of video, delivering both as very good high-definition as well as an accurate, film-like presentation of a cinema classic. The extras are truly exceptional, way more comprehensive than the average catalog release.This is truly a stellar (heh, heh) release. I can't recommend it enough. I anticipate getting MANY viewings out of this title for years to come, and look forward to passing on this film classic to the next generation as well."	5.0	**Blu-Ray Review** Spectacular Package For A Truly Seminal Sci-Fi Film	2010-09-11	16	14	2

It is a veritable Sci-fi Classic of the `50s, over par of class-B and very innovative with tremendous special effects.I've seen it when I was just in my early teens and now when I saw it again still remembered some features as the footprint of the invisible monster and the lovely Altaira and her short skirted dresses.This is the plot: a starship from the Earth comes to rescue a long lost scientific expedition. They are received by Dr. Morbius, the only survivor and Altaira his daughter, born on the planet, being her mother a deceased fellow investigator of Dr. Morbius. He states he doesn't need to be rescued and interrupt his fascinating investigation of a lost planetary civilization: the Krells.Due to this civilization, Commander Adams declares he needs to consult Earth authorities as to what to do. That means he must stay at least two weeks and partially dissemble his ship in order to build a huge transmitter. Dr. Morbius offer the aid of Robby his multitask robot, (a remarkable creation of the film makers that fascinated the audience of the times). While Adams and his crew are performing this task they are attacked by an invisible monster that destroys essential equipment.Adams order an electrical perimeter to be erected around the ship and next night they are attacked by the alien monster rendered half visible by the fence. The monster retires after killing some crew members. From here on the film reaches its climax.There are no big stars in the cast; nevertheless playacting is correct and convincing. Anne Francis composes a lovely nave girl, Leslie Nielsen correctly fleshes Commander Adams and veteran Walter Pigeon is Dr. Moribius.The outstanding items of the movie are the special effects, really over par for 1956 and the story, intelligent and thought provoking.This is a film that will be enjoyed by classic sci-fi fans and general public too.Reviewed by Max Yofre.	5.0	Beware of the Id Monster!	2011-01-21	1	1	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3LWA5BX43AP8D	"M. Bigg ""Mal"""	Blu Ray transfer is o.k but not strikingly so.  Lots of pointless features but lacks a commentary track which in my view is often the only feature worth having.  It is so obvious that Star Trek lifted its premise virtually direct from this underrated movie - which for its time had great special effects and a plot that could have been a Star Trek episode itself.  A plot  that not only drew from Shakespeare but toyed with the mind as well.  Weakest part of the movie is the animated Id monster, but I guess had I watched it in 1956 I might have been nevertheless impressed. Its also nice to be reminded that Leslie Nielson was not just a (brilliant) comedy buffoon but a slick dramatic performer as well.Anne Francis' legs are distracting treat and of course you have the introduction of American film's first major Robot star...but I still favour 'The Robot' from Lost in Space - in which Robbie also appears.	4.0	The one (in my view) that started it all.	2013-08-20	3	2	1

This movie inspired me to actually read &#34;The Tempest&#34; and enjoy it.The movie: Well done with excellent special effects. Many of which still stand up today on their own or in inspirations in many Sci-Fi movies currently being made. The acting was good even if somewhat below the capabilities of its primaries. Leslie Neilsen's current comedic fame may effect how some may see his role, but he does a good job as well as Joseph Cotton, others and of course...Robby the Robot.The discs: Excellent transfer. Deep blacks. High contrasts. Color definition. All together helps to really appreciate the work gone into the making of this classic sci-fi. The extras were not a let down either. They were very informative and enjoyable to watch. Seeing effects I could easily identify in movies and TV was fun. I could hardly believe the amount of thought that went into the effects.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	So spoke Lt. 'Doc' Ostrow (Warren Stevens) of the United Planets Cruiser C-57-D after it arrived at the planet Altair IV. The C-57-D, commanded by Commander John F. Adams (Leslie Nielsen), was sent to Altair IV from Earth to rescue a colony sent there two decades earlier on the spaceship Belleraphon because all contact was lost shortly thereafter.  When the C-57-D arrived at Altair IV, they received a warning from philologist Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pigeon) that they should not land.  He also claimed to be the lone survivor of the doomed Belleraphon.  However, Commander Adams had his orders and the C-57-D landed on Altair IV in spite of Dr. Morbius' objections.  After landing, Dr. Morbius and his robotic companion Robby (Robot the Robot) greeted the C-57-D crew, but Dr. Morbius continued to insist that they should leave immediately.  Unexpectedly, a beautiful woman, Altaira (Anne Francis), appears.  She is Dr. Morbius' daughter, whom he had ordered not to be seen while the C-57-D crew was on the surface.  The crew is delighted to meet Altaira, who have not seen a woman for 378 days while en route to Altair IV, but they were also surprised because she was not listed on the Belleraphon's passenger manifest.  Dr. Morbius explained that he was married by the Belleraphon captain, but that his wife died on the planet shortly after giving birth to Altaira.Altaira was not the only thing that Dr. Morbius planned to hide from the spaceship visiting from Earth: he also had no intention of revealing Altair IV's biggest secret, but Commander Adams and Doc Ostrow forced the issue.  Reluctantly, Dr. Morbius explained that a race far more intellectually and techonologically advance than mankind, the Krell, once inhabited Altair IV.  Sadly, for hitherto unknown reasons, the Krell became extinct virtually over night as well as all other life on the planet 200,000 years earlier; but not all of the Krell's secrets had been lost.  As foretold by Dr. Morbius, strange things begin to happen to the visiting spaceship and crew similar to what ultimately destroyed the Belleraphon; and the isolated peace that Dr. Morbius and Altaira knew on the dead planet before the spaceship's arrival evaporates.Taking inspiration from William Shakespeare's play &quot;The Tempest&quot;, writers Irving Block and Allen Adler created a brilliant story for &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.  The Duke Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot; became Dr. Morbius, his daughter Miranda became Altaira, the enslaved spirit Ariel became Robby the Robot, Ferdinand became Commander Adams, the island of exile became the planet Altair IV and Caliban became a monster bent on destruction.Under the direction of Fred M. Wilcox, the acting, dialog and special effects for &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; greatly surpasses nearly all other sci-fi films produced in the 1950's and 1960's.  Having been twice previously nominated for Best Actor in 1942 for &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; and in 1943 for &quot;Madame Curie&quot;, Walter Pigeon's portrayal of Dr. Morbius was exceptional.  &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; received a 1956 Oscar nomination for Best Special Effects, but lost to the only other nominated film, Cecil B. DeMille's &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;.  It was not until Stanley Kubrick filmed &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; in 1968 that a sci-fi film surpassed &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; in quality and achievement.  The few films comparable to &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; from the 1950's include &quot;The Day The Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) and &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (1953).Time has not caused &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; to lose any of its excellence. Sci-fi fans more accustomed to modern computer-enhanced special effects may regard the effects used in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; to be dated, but most will more than likely come to appreciate what Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was able to achieve with 1950's film technology.  For example, some may be surprised to see that George Lucas (in his 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;) was not the first to show what a holographic image could look like, as demonstrated in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.  Some may also be surprised to see Leslie Nielsen portray a serious character, instead of his more recent, bumbling comedic characters in films such as &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; (1988).  Overall, I give &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; a highly deserved 5 out of 5 stars, as it will always be a timeless, landmark sci-fi film warning us to always beware of monsters from the id!	5.0	&quot;A green sky, a man could get used to that!&quot;	2003-03-05	0	0	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	APL7KHB0KKPA3	Michael H. Siegel	Forbidden Planet is probably the best representative of science fiction's golden age at the movies.  The 1950's and 60's saw a generation of writers produce a series of excellent, though-provoking films that were all the better because they were grounded in hard science and ideas. Movie like Planet of the Apes, Forbidden Planet and Day the Earth Stood Still. Today's deriviative unimaginative sci-fi garbage films don't hold a candle to them for all their cgi glory.The Forbidden Planet deals with an Earth ship investigating a previous landing on a nearby planet.  Only one man and his teenage daughter survive and the fate of the other crew -- and the nature of the planet itself -- is shrouded in mystery.The plot is basically The Tempest in space.  And those with a keen eye will see how this movie heavily influence the original Star Trek.  But this is still a treat.  Anne Farris and (talk about surprises) Leslie Nielson give good performances.  The special effects stand up remarkably well after so long.But again, what sets this movie apart are the ideas.  See the detail when the crew take their ship apart to build an insterstellar communicator.  Or how the crew carefully and systematically deals with the dangers they are presented with.I can't recommend this film to everyone, since too many people will get caught up in the movie's age and that many of its original ideas have been copied so much as to now be cliche'.  But if you like serious sci-fi, you will love this movie.  Here's a quick litmus test.  If you liked the recent flashy-but-pointless Planet of the Apes, you will not like this movie.  But if you liked the original though-provoking Planet of the Apes, don't hesitate to add this to your colllection.	4.0	From sci-fi's golden age...	2004-01-09	3	2	1

Basically the movie is set in the year 2200 and a group of soldies is sent to the planet Altair IV to find out what happen to a group of scientists who try to colonize the planet 20 years ago. Once the expedition reaches the planet reaches the planet the find the three remaining survivors. Robby The Robot, Dr. Edward Morbius, and Altaira ""Alta"" Morbius.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2M1N8G4W4END8	Michael R Gates	A liberal interpretation of William Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST, with a wee bit of Freudian psychology thrown into the mix, the 1956 science-fiction classic FORBIDDEN PLANET follows the crew of a United Planets Cruiser on a mission to the distant planet Altair IV, home to a once-thriving scientific colony that has been mysteriously incommunicado for some time.When the cruiser reaches Altair IV, Commander John J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen) and his crew make radio contact with a Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), one of the hitherto &quot;missing&quot; colonists.  However, Morbius warns Adams to turn back, insisting that the crew will be in mortal danger if they touch down on the planet's surface. Adams orders his crew to land the ship anyway, of course, and they find that all the members of colony have perished save for three--Dr. Morbius, his curvaceous daughter Altaira (Anne Francis), and an intellectual robotic wunderkind named Robby.Not satisfied with Morbius' explanation about what happened to the other colonists, Adams and his crew seek evidence that will either corroborate or discredit Morbius' story.  What they find is the remnants of the advanced alien race that inhabited the Altair IV aeons ago.  Could this hold the key that unlocks the mystery of the missing colonists?Even after nearly half a century, FORBIDDEN PLANET remains both an interesting and thought-provoking film.  Not only does it offer a clever space-age interpretation of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST, the special FX are still eye-poppingly cool, even when faced off against the CGI FX of contemporary fare.  One of the best special FX in the film is, of course, Robby the Robot.  A very expensive prop for MGM to build, Robby stands at a height of 7-and-a-half feet and weighs about 300 pounds.  He has become one of the most popular robots in the history of films and television, and as such, he has made cameo appearances in such movies as 1984's GREMLINS and 2003's LOONEY TUNES: BACK IN ACTION and on television shows like THE TWILIGHT ZONE and LOST IN SPACE.In addition to Robby, the three principal human actors in FORBIDDEN PLANET also contribute to the film's success.  Leslie Nielsen is well known to film buffs as the comic star of such films as THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD (1988) and SPY HARD (1996).  But here he does an excellent job in a serious role as John J. Adams, the commander of the spaceship, and for modern audiences, then, there is this added treat of seeing Nielson play one of the stodgy establishment types that he is now famous for parodying.  The deep-voiced Walter Pidgeon is a masterful old-school thespian who is also a delight to watch.  Here he makes his Dr. Morbius a devilishly pompous and pendantic patriarch, and the histrionics with which he does so are perfectly suited to the character.  And finally, there's the lovely Anne Francis playing Dr. Morbius' daughter, Altaira.  While Ms. Francis does not have the same range or depth as Nielsen or Pidgeon, she takes a role that was meant to be eye-candy and makes it more than a mere cardboard cut-out.So the storytelling, the FX, and the acting all combine to make FORBIDDEN PLANET a compelling film that entertains but also makes you think.  And to genre fans, that is science fiction at its best.The MGM DVD is short on extras, basically offering only the theatrical trailer.  But the disc does offer the film in an anamorphic widescreen format at the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and it appears that the digital transfer was made from a copy of the print that was in excellent shape for a film so old!

But I actualy can not do that to this movie! I was actualy impressed at how they did some of the effects for this. Even tho I can tell they where drawn is as a cartoon, they are done exceptionly well for a 1956 film.The only thing I laughed at was Leslie Nielson looking so young! It was weird watchign him do strait acting, but after a while I got into it. I can see why it's a classic easily. I could even instantly see that Lost In Space ripped it off quite a bit.It wont suprise me to see this movie being re-made in the near future. It starts well, continues well, and ends well.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3M2O06MCHJG18	"MiddleAgedReviewer ""M_A_R"""	"I received the Ultimate Collector's Edition for Christmas, and was extremely grateful.  The movie is an absolute science fiction classic, worthy of FIVE STAR accolades, however, I highly recommend that anyone interested in the 50th Anniversary Edition consider the Forbidden Planet Two-Disc 50th Anniversary Special Edition instead of the Ultimate Collector's Edition.  The two-disc version contains everything the movie fan really wants, and at half the price.Please allow me to explain why.The Ultimate Collector's Edition comes with a second movie, ""The Invisible Boy"" which also stars the legendary Robbie the Robot.  While that is nice, I never wanted nor cared about the second movie.  This packaging, while attractive, is akin to having the price substantially boosted on you for purchasing a second movie you're not really interested in.  It's very much like those offers here on Amazon you'll see when you're looking at a movie you might want to buy, and then they suggest ""buy this along with ""Name of Movie you Don't Want"" for $50.00"".  It's nice for the suggestion, but I don't think I've ever taken one of them.Next, the tin package is cool, but it contains many other things you'll never really care about.  The miniture of Robby is just that.  It's a cat toy, truth be told, and if you remove it from the tin, you'll lose it.The package also comes with ""lobby cards"" for both Forbidden Planet and the movie you don't really care about.  They're a little bit bigger than post cards, and chances are they will go back into the tin and never be seen again.The extra features on the Forbidden Planet DVD are apparently very similar to the ones on the two-disc collection.  I'm not certain if the two-disc collection has some of the deleted scenes (which, while short, were fascinating to watch), but the other features offered on the two disc seem to be missing from the ""Ultimate"" which makes me wonder why they considered that name at all.  You'd figure ""Ultimate"" would have it all, but it very clearly doesn't.I'm not going to review the movie itself any further than I have here; it's brilliant, and I'm thrilled to have it in my collection (although the tin takes up way too much room on the shelf, and I really don't think that the cardboard insert would really stand alone very well if I removed it for the shelf).To sum it up, anyone considering this purchase should really look at the 50th Anniversay Two-Disc version before making a decision.  My advise?  Just go to the two-disc version and hit ""Add to Cart"" and don't worry about what you might miss from the ""Ultimate"" version."	2.0	The 2-Disc 50th Anniversary Edition is a Much Better Value than The Ultimate	2007-01-09	9	6	3
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AKBIZ5YYUSXB4	MikeCPI	"In terms of screenplay, special effects, art direction and music score, ""Forbidden Planet"" excels in comparison to the legion of sci-fi movies released during the decade. Though made a decade before Kubrick's ""2001: A space Odyssey,"" ""Forbidden Planet"" visually offers a surprisingly realistic view of life in outer space. The psychological twist that solves the mystery of the invisible monster threatening the story's leads is one of the most creative ever conjured as well. The 50's sexist stereotypes that populate the interactions among the cast, however, are the only things that have not aged well in this otherwise brilliant space saga.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"""Forbidden Planet"", created at MGM in 1956, was a high-budget high-concept science fiction film among the many low-budget sci-fi flicks made for drive-in theaters in that decade. It doesn't possess the intellectualism of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", nor does it hold up as well, but the two films have common themes. Cdr. John Adams (Leslie Nielsen) leads a mission to the planet Altair-4, where an expedition landed 20 years before and has not been heard from since. His ship is warned away by Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), a survivor of the earlier mission. Morbius explains the violent fate met by his colleagues and urges the visitors to leave. Only Morbius and his comely daughter Altaira (Ann Francis) have survived and thrived. Now aware of the disaster, Adams must await instructions from Earth. But some invisible threat still lurks on the planet.It was probably the film's brightly colored Cinemscope, friendly robot Robby, and neat-o special effects that most impressed audiences when it was released, but I was struck by ""Forbidden Planet""s obvious influence on subsequent science fiction films and television. The impact on Gene Roddenberry's ""Star Trek"" was substantial, right down to the costumes, the communicators, and, of course, the allegory -though Roddenberry was decidedly more optimistic. ""Forbidden Planet"" posits that technology and knowledge do not fundamentally change people. A species cannot grow out of its violent primitivism. A gloomy message for a big, colorful, sci-fi adventure. I don't know what to make of the acting style, which I found peculiarly wooden. But this is a must-see for science fiction fans, if only because it is so recognizable in retrospect.The DVD (Warner 2000): This disc is two-sided, with full screen on one side and widescreen on the other. The print is perfectly watchable but not clean. There are white specks. A theatrical trailer (4 min) is included. George Lucas seems to have taken some visual inspiration from this trailer, though the ""Star Wars"" saga has more in common with B-movies.

The box is very cute but came slightly dented from shipping.  The Robbie doll is cute also.My major criticism is that there was no text with the package that described the history or actors, for example.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	M. Oleson	"While somewhat primitive based on what we see today, the special effects and sets created for this sci-fi classic raised the bar for the genre.  For a more accurate comparison, look at some of the other films of the day.  Before Leslie Nielsen became the go-to guy for comedic parodies, he was a serious actor and yes, this is a serious film. Ann Francis plays his romantic interest and wears short ""futuristic"" outfits that, as Steven Spielberg says, ""makes you wish she were your babysitter"" when watching this movie as a kid. Both Nielsen and Francis died recently.The story involves a team of space travelers from Earth in the 23rd century who are on a mission to find a research party that has not been heard from.  Upon arrival at the planet Altair-4, they are met by the lone survivors, Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon adding credibility to the role) and his winsome daughter, Alta (Francis).  The rest of the party has been killed by an alien creature decades earlier.  Morbius has discovered a new race that ruled for thousands of centuries only to disappear overnight.  The seemingly undefeatable creature comes back again, and the Shakespearian plot thickens.Sure, the film has its share of cheese but it is easily offset by a more serious look at our inner selves.  Perhaps more important is that ""Forbidden Planet"" took a serious look at science fiction in film and set the stage for Star Trek, Star Wars and others to follow.As an aside, the Blu ray package includes a terrific TCM documentary ""Watch the Skies!"" about sci-fi films of the 50's featuring interviews with the aforementioned Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron and Ridley Scott.  These guys know their film history and really get excited about these science fiction classics."	4.0	Excellent Blu ray transfer for this sci-fi classic	2011-10-25	6	5	1

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A19ATJJUHRFV88	Monty Mason	This wholly engrossing, action science fiction is a sleeper from the 50's.  If you are a reader in the Course in Miracles, you will see a graphic depiction of the &#34;ego&#34; as outlined in the Course -- and well before the Course's writing.  (I've been student  of The Course for 30 years, so I might see more in it than others.  I'll risk that.)Although for certain the &#34;ego&#34; really doesn't look like this, nor operate exactly like this, the parallels of the movie are both instructive and powerful as an emotional approach to understanding the human condition.  Besides, much spiritual wisdom equates an emotional approach as superior to a logical one.  Think of Jesus and the parables. Besides, you get to see Ann Francis again.I am quite surprised that this old (and presumably forgotten) gem is arrayed with other spiriual items.	5.0	A Critique of &#34;The Forbidden Planet&#34; -- Science Fiction as Spiritual Awakening	2012-11-30	2	2	0

I have seen this movie more times than I can count and I never tire of it.If you are a science fiction buff, then you should definitely add this classic movie to your collection.A bit of trivia... this movie was the first big-budget sci-fi movie produced from a major Hollywood studio (MGM). Prior to Forbidden Planet, any and all sci-fi movies were low budget B grade movies that had minimal special effects and were produced by small, independent studios.Anyway, I LOVE this movie and I hope you will as well.	5.0	The original and still the best!	2005-06-16	4	4	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2XRZV63X79YSJ	"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector"""	Forbidden Planet was based on Shakespeare's The Tempest.  Well, saying that Forbidden Planet was based on The Tempest is like saying Silver Streak was based on Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.  It would be better to say Forbidden Planet was inspired by The Tempest.Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) headed a doomed scientific party twenty years prior to the planet Altair-4.  A rescue party has been sent to find their fate.  It is headed by the dashing Captain Adams (Leslie Nielsen - yes at one time Leslie was dashing.)  Morbius warns off Adams but Adams is determined to find out the fate of the expedition.Morbius tells him that all died from a strange monster, all except he and his wife.  Oh and his beautiful daughter, Altaira (Anne Francis).  The entire crew falls for Altaira including the Captain.  Little by little the secrets of the planet, its extinct race, the Krells, and the monster are revealed.  We also have the first famous robot, Robbie, the Robot.Pidgeon is most famous for his series of films with Greer Garson, including the Oscar winner Mrs. Miniver.  But when she retired, so did his career (and that was a shame as he is a great actor).  This was a chance for him to headline a film.  He created a niche for himself that would give him quality films until he retired.  By the way he reunited with Anne Francis, sort of, in Funny Girl.The rest of the cast was up and comers.  Most found their success in television.  Anne Francis became Honey West.  Leslie Nielsen is most associated with Police Squad.  Jack Kelly was one of the Mavericks.  Richard Anderson was the boss of The Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman.  Earl Holliman was boss to Police Woman.  James Drury was The Virginian.  So as you can see, there are a lot of familiar faces here.The production quality is a bit cheesy but this was really the first true outer space film and you have to forgive this.  The sets are great but they look like sets.  By today's standards, the visual effect are bland but you have to take it for the time that this was made.  The effects were state of the are for the 50's and extremely clean.  They blend very well with the scene, they do not look at all fake.As stated before, this is inspired by The Tempest.  The Tempest is on of my favorite Shakespeare plays but it is seldom staged and it has only been filmed for television.  It would increase your enjoyment of the film to see The Tempest.DVD EXTRAS: None	5.0	Shakespeare in Outer Space	2006-01-01	7	7	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A16PS5BKJQIX1M	Mr MC-fon	This movie is a must have for any Sci-Fi fan out there. Why? It has robby the robot which is a world wide icon from the futuristic views and hopes people had in the 1950's. Special effects are not the main focus of this classic but the story is. For that reason despite 50+ years this movie remains a timeless classic.Now lets talk about the transfer. Picture quality perhaps could have been better but it is pretty good as it is. I made a comparison with my DVD. There is no chance of comparison. The DVD was never good to start with the amount of film dust, scratches and other debris left a lot to be desired, sharpness was bad too. This blu ray is fairly sharp most of the time, colors are good and sound is good. Worth the upgrade just because of the improvement in picture.Now,if you still have doubts lets look at the extras. I rarely do and I am so glad I did. I nearly fell of my chair when I discovered that this copy from Amazon included the full length Invisible Boy movie. If you don't know this movie it is a B/W movie with robby and an evil computer trying to take over the world. Not as good as the main feature but worth having for a robby fan. It also includes an episode from a TV series where robby appeared.There are several deleted scenes and lost footage from forbidden planet, quality of these is generally awful but interesting to see.Invisible boy in my system showed it as a 720i so I suppose it qualifies as HD. Picture quality of invisible boy was very good and better than a lot of DVD's I wouldn't have expected that as an extra.

Needless to say after getting an HD DVD player I was excited to pick this up, and check it out. The results unfortunately are mixed. The principal photography of the movie has an excellent HD DVD transfer, tons of detail so much in fact I was rather amused to clearly see the lines between the physical sets and the painted backdrops!Ok so now the bad part. Any shots that feature FX work by Disney (laser fx, the ID monster etc) are all blurry. They look like standard DVD definition compared to the HD DVD footage that surrounds them. You see quite a pop when the image cuts from fx footage to on set photography. The image sharply gets more detailed, or swapping to FX less detailed. Its a shame WB couldn't really do this special edition the justice it deserves by getting the quality consistent all through the movie.The movie has lots of great extras, but the mix and match nature of the image quality sadly hurts the overall presentation.	4.0	HD DVD Review  -  Mixed Transfer Quality	2006-11-26	17	16	1

Even has a brief history of Human civilization and space travel. a beautiful transfer. Even has outtakes not used. (Wish they had they add to the film.) Sadly no commentary track that it sorely needed.Still many behind-the-scenes and as extras two things Robbie later appeared in. A tv show with Walther Pigeon and &#34;The Invisible Boy&#34; from 1957.Note that the cover mistakenly changes the rather bland gray of the uniforms into a color coded one.

The box alone makes a great collector's item.  We enjoyed watching Forbidden Planet again, though were a little disappointed with The Invisible Boy.  We were looking forward to seeing another movie that Robbie was in, but it was nowhere near the same class as Forbidden Planet.  I guess this was to be expected.  Still, it was interesting seeing Robbie in something else.  The three documentaries were really fascinating, so sci-fi film buffs would love those.  In summary, you'll love this box set if you want the DVD extras and the movie memorabilia.  If you just want to see Forbidden Planet, you might be better off just buying the DVD.	4.0	Forbidden Planet special edition	2007-01-15	4	3	1

It has everything, horror, action, great scenes and plot, and even a beautiful maiden. I wish they had made a sequel so I could learn more about those amazing Krell.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A13UFU1894FYT8	OldBrit	"Forbidden Planet, filmed in EastmanColor and CinemaScope was given the ""A"" picture treatment by MGM, which borrowed some animators from Disney studios to help with the special effects. The special effects are great, but the sets and costuming are lavish, creative, beautiful, and show that ""MGM touch"" - which had never before been seen in a sci-film. However, one special effect deserves a comment: The ""DC"" stations used by the crew to safely decelerate from hyperdrive lightspeed will make you think your looking at the transporter room on Star Trek. Surely, this is where Gene Roddenberry got the idea for his famous ""beam me up, Scotty"" special effect.The story takes place on the distant planet Altair which was once home to the scientifically advanced Krell. As the story unfolds, we learn about their advanced technology, which is self-servicing and still operational - and we discover what happened to the Krell. This isn't post-war propaganda about a nuclear apocalypse or alien invaders, but it does investigate the inability of human beings to responsibly use advanced technology. Hint: Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud would have loved this plot!One of the less believable aspects of the film is that, according to Dr. Morbius, ""The shape of the (extent) Krell doorways indicate the physical shape of the Krell, like doorways on Earth would give us an idea of the shape of human beings."" By this standard, the Krell must've had the basic dimensions of Jabba the Hutt - but, we're told the gravity on Altair is slightly less than the gravity on Earth, so we would expect the Krell to be taller than humans, not wider.All of the actors are well cast and the acting is far better than most sci-fi films. Anne Francis, while not a great actor, steals the show. She was born to play the educated, but naive Altaira, who is totally unaware of her own sexuality and the effect it might have on men. She thinks that because Captain Adams turns his back when she gets out of a swimming hole scantily clad, that he doesn't like her of find her attractive.Robby The Robot gives Anne Francis some competition since he first appears in The Forbidden Planet and goes on to an illustrious career in over 25 films and TV series. Robby is certainly the most successful robot actor on film.Disney's The Black Hole, which I believe to be one of the most beautiful sci-fi films ever made, pays homage to Forbidden Planet. The next time you watch The Black Hole, think of the tour Morbius gives to Captain Adams and the view looking up and down the 150 or so stories in the underground Krell power plant. (Please don't bother to attack me because I like The Black Hole. I am fully aware that many people simply bypass the gorgeous cinematography and art direction in The Black Hole and go directly into nuclear attack mode claiming The Black Hole to be one of the worst films ever made.)While, some of the special effects may look cheesy by today's standards, taken as a whole, Forbidden Planet remains a great and highly entertaining sci-fi film."	5.0	An intelligent sci-fi movie from the 1950's	2013-10-12	1	1	0

Even remember my mom fussing to my dad about the swimming scene until she realized the actress was in fact 'not' au natural. Still chuckle at that even after all these years. I really enjoyed seeing this movie again. Been a quite few years and it was fun to compare this early effort against the modern computer generated new age science fiction movies. It shows how far they thought outside the box when they made this one. Just kick back in the easy chair and enjoy it.The second movie ""The Invisible Kid"", well YIKES.. is the best I can say if I want to keep all my commments ""G"" rated. Wasn't a total waste of film, but almost. The portrayal of ""Robbie the Robot""  as a remote controlled tin puppet instead of a revolutionary technical marvel nearly ruined the movie for me. The self-aware computer did bring a twist to the plot that at least made the flick watchable. Acting, UGH!. It's one of those movies where you are left thinking ""THEY COULD HAVE DONE SO MUCH BETTER WITH THIS.""For a change, I found the special features to be actually entertaining.

Although the acting and dialogue are a little &#34;hoakie&#34; at times, the special effects (provided by the Disney Studios) and the plot (supposededly based on Shakespeare's &#34;The Temest&#34;) are well done.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A83VFWZVHIJ79	"Peter Karsten ""Osiris"""	"The 1950's was the golden age of science fiction, many great films were made, that even now influence our lives and thoughts today. One such film is Forbidden Planet, and for me. It is still one of the best films-and perhaps the only film that has a unique sound track which can not be beaten. Not only that but it introduced one of the best great robots of all time - Robby, this robot is so iconic, it-or he is instantly recognisable.Before I go on, I just have to say that the music for the film was and still is ahead of its time, and if you watch the credits it comes under `Electronic Tonalities' by Louis and Bebe Barron, this inspiring couple used no musical instruments to compose the weird and wonderful music of Forbidden Planet; and if you look at the theatrical posters of the time, this couple's names are not mentioned - the Academy didn't even recognised the film score as music-how ignorant is that? Because no actual musical instruments were used, Louis and Bebe used tape and electronics to compose the now unforgettable haunting sound for the film. In my mind both Louise and Bebe Barron should receive honorary Oscars for original film score-its well overdue.Now as for the acting skills of the performers, Walter Pidgeon is perfectly cast as Dr.  Edward Morbius, you don't know wether to love him or pity him in his struggle with his Id, and over developed intellect. Then there's the lovely Anne Francis as Altaira, Morbius' daughter, beautiful, nave, and bright. Leslie Nielsen as Commander J. J. Adams, strong and heroic. Warren Stevens as Dr. Ostrow-unusual name, wise, intelligent, a close friend of the commander. It seems there are shades of the Kirk and McCoy between these two men, as the characters/actors work well together. Jack Kelly as Lt. Jerry Farman, another friend of Adams, a likeable easy going guy, obviously a ladies man. Plus two other recognisable actors early in their careers are Richard Anderson (Six Million Dollar Man/Bionic Woman), as Chief Quinn, and Earl Holliman (Police Woman), as  Cook, giving a light comedic touch to the film. A well balanced cast in my opinion.Okay, let's look at this 50th Anniversary Edition of Forbidden Planet, first when it states that it is the Ultimate Collector's Edition, you must never use the word `Ultimate' because it implies it contains everything and anything-well this edition-doesn't-of course thus you'll end up scrutinising it no end-and yes you guess it, I'm going to do just that; let's have a look at what you get anyway:1] Forbidden Planet (Widescreen)2] The Invisible Boy (Widescreen-bonus movie feathering Robby)3] 17 Lobby Cards (reproductions 5A size-approx of both films)4] Forbidden Planet - Deleted Scenes and Lost Footage5] Excerpts from `The MGM Parade' TV series with Walter Pidgeon6] `Client' episode with Robby from the TV series `The Thin Man'7] 3 Documentaries: `Amazing! Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet', `Robby the Robot: Engineering a Sci-Fi Icon', and `TCM Original Watch the Skies!: Science Fiction, the 1950s and Us'8] Science-Fiction Movie Trailer Gallery9] 3.5"" figure of Robby the RobotAll the above is presented to you in  a tin case-which is itself worth getting.Now in regards the Robby the Robot figure, which was one of the main reasons I got this DVD Edition. I am really disappointed because there is a little false advertising involved, if one looks at the back of the box, the figure of Robby is about 21cm tall, compared to the other merchandize shown,  but in reality it is about 9cm (3.5"" inches tall), even though it states in small print that the figure is 3.5"" Actual Size. (Even on the Amazon website picture shows what I mean) It is obvious that the Marketing Department wanted to sucker us in-well it worked with me, and looking at the metal box it came in, you can easily fit a 6"" inch Robby figure. So the point is don't be fooled-seeing is not believing.So is this really the Ultimate Edition-well no, because there's no such thing, I mean if we are featuring Robby as a bonus in what he has done over the years, then two more acting skills should have been included in this 50th Anniversary Edition: 1] the Lost in Space episode, ""The War of the Robots"" and 2] the Ark II episode, ""The Robot"", (this episode showed Robby with a different look than what we are used too) and there are more, of course like than appearance in Wonder Woman for example.Plus there are two other things I would like with this edition, a booklet, describing the movie, some production notes, cast & crew listing, and any trivia, as well as a CD of the original Film/Music sound track. Why is it that special, anniversary or collector editions don't have CD sound tracks, I'm sure the collector would like to hear the musical score-wouldn't you?All in all this 50th Anniversary Edition of Forbidden Planet is cool, and the film is my third all-time favourite sci-fi film, and it's easy to see why. You can get just the double DVD without the Robby figure, but if you go that far-go the extra, you won't be disappointed.One final point, Forbidden Planet is pure science fiction at it's best for the era, and it still hold up today, this is science fiction as it was meant to be, this film set standards for future films to follow.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	ALXZ64A9OAPJ8	"Phrodoe ""Child Of The Kindly Midwest"""	If you have a moment -- and I assume you do -- I'd like to talk about Forbiden Planet. It's one of the films (along with She, Island of Lost Souls, The Day the earth Stood Still, and a handfull of others) that transformed science fiction films, from their undeserved status as kids' stuff, to serious depictions of the human condition...not to mention the alien condition, which is so often and unsettlingly similar to our own. And speaking of unsettling resemblances, have you ever noticed how much this film resembles Star Trek? Can't be helped. There's a certain &quot;family resemblance&quot; in a lot of s-f, and the ship/crew/new worlds gimmick was in use long before Captains Adams and Kirk appeared. Anyway, the producers of Forbidden Planet could hardly sue anyone for plagiarism, now could they?The story is that of The Tempest; though certain events have been changed and liberties taken, the core of Shakespeare's play remains unchanged. Prospero (i.e. Morbius) guards his daughter and island-bound privacy jealously, and uses his magic to confuse and terroroize the party of sailors who've landed there. It's a small step from this to Altair-IV; with the Krell to provide Morbius' magic, Robby the Robot to act as both Caliban and Ariel, and some good old techno-huggermugger thrown in to help obfuscate things further, it's a different (but still similar) story. It's also a damned good story, a powerful depiction of a man destroyed by his darkest subconscous obsessions. It's a story that demands to be taken seriously...and in spite of such distractions as a drunken robot, not to mention the clumsiest seduction ever committed to celluloid, take it seriously we do.One of the most important reasons this film was taken seriously was its special effects. Many of them were, and still are, some of the best of their kind. Even by today's advanced standards, a good deal of the visuals are real-looking and seamless. Watch the scene where Adams vaporizes the tiger; it's almost impossible to see the effects edit. And even though Altair is obviously a soundstage, the Krell constructions beneath Mobius' home achieve complete reality. This feels like -- no, is -- an alien environment...which leads to another great visual: Morbius, Adams and the Doc, walking on the gantry, infinitesimal specks against the massive Krell machinery all around them. And even the soundstage set has its moments -- when the monster gets caught in the force-field, and you get your first good look at its misshapen, demonic form, it's an instant edge-of-your-seat moment. Whatever you were expecting, it sure wasn't that!As to the actors -- well, Walter Pidgeon pretty much carries the film, which is really only fair as his character is the key to everything. Anne Francis, who would later go on to immortality in a lyric from Rocky Horror Picture Show, is very good -- and absolutely gorgeous! -- as sheltered (but game) daughter Vena. And Leslie Nielsen, a very funny guy who persists in doing unfunny movies, here does an admirable job with a role that was written to be one-dimensional. Nielsen somehow stretches J. J. Adams to two-and-a-half dimensions -- now that's acting! (they've given Oscars for less!) The supporting cast perform their various script-related functions (hey, just like Star Trek!), and do so very capably...though I can't imagine why a tight-run ship like Adams' would have an alcoholic cook -- or, for that matter, why such an advanced ship would even have an old-fashioned pots-n-pans kitchen in the first place. Oh, well...even in spite of such obvious mistakes, Forbidden Planet is still a classic, a great film in any category, and will be loved by anybody who loves movies.	5.0	Serious Science Fiction	2001-07-10	3	3	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3UPUKYMXBF8WE	"P. Johnston ""Return to the Sci Fi Planet"""	All the other reviewers were perhaps too upset about the image quality, to note that *gee* this story is long on technology exposition, free of character, and story telling cohesion.  This movie stinks.  Who in their right mind would recommend this movie to another sentient being?1. It's so god awfully boring. Most of the movie is Walter Pidgen explaining outrageous(not really) technology in a professorial monotone in a single camera shot.  Apparently they spent all their money making Robbie the Robot's gyroscopes motorized instead of hiring a director with even a kindergartener's understanding of composition. Also the director really wants you to get how amazing techonology is! Even it means this movie crawls at a snail's pace unrelieved by true wonder, or a glimpse of an alien tentacle.  See the five minute shot of the flying saucer's landing gear- an homage to a stainless steel column stool a la a fifties diner.2. The first third of this movie is a nerds-only sex farce wherein various corn-pone nineteen fifties types try to teach Virgin Anne Francis how to kiss. Anne Francis on the other hand is too busy taming the inexplicable tigers that roam planet Altair with her Virgin powers. That or the space cook trying to get Robbie the Robot to make him up some Kentucky Bourbon.  And then suddenly this drops and Anne Francis doesn't say another line until the last five minutes of the movie. Because Walter Pidgen has to come back on and do more exposition the wonders of Krell technology, a long dead alien race we haven't glimpsed or known about until the second act.3. Just in case you weren't going gaga over the blinking lights, and far-out techno sounds that accompany them *don't worry* there is a big ole monster that comes along. Again due to budgetery concerns this monster is INVISIBLE. We do however get to see a vewy scawy plaster cast of a claw.Were this a Star Trek episode, it'd be succinct and succulent.  Instead the only thing worth seeing in this movie is Walter Pidgen's totally swank Jetson's pad, Anne Francis's perky little bod, and Leslie Nielson when he had brown hair.  Apparently it inspired Star Trek which is perhaps the only reason in a million years you might want to watch this forgettable trash.	1.0	Captain, I'm dieing of boredom!	2009-10-02	106	13	93
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A311RDU1T1YMZ5	PK	What can I say. This is probably the second best science fiction film, second only after The Day the Earth Stood Still, from the golden age of science fiction, when movies made you think. Unlike the drivel that comes out from Hollywood today. Today's science fiction films have degenerated into whiz bang shoot-em-ups. Thin plot lines and heavy on the CGI. Acting and a good plot line today seems to have taken a subordinate role.	5.0	Excellent Master of this outstanding film!	2014-05-14	1	1	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AS9GB19AOOT2P	Prince Riley	"I won't talk at any length about the motion picture itself since so many others have done such a good job of that already. This will be a more  personal review and one that I hope will give you a different perspective of the film's value as a piece of Sci-Fi Movie History.Do I recommend you buy a copy of Forbidden Planet. Unequivocally.. yes, buy it and not so much as an icon of Sci-Fi movie making. I'll simply encourage you to buy this DVD for it's significance as one of the first truly mature and sensible science fiction movies ever produced. It's influence on the gene from the 1950's right up to the present is well documented. Buy this DVD for the rich experience it will give you of a Sci-Fi picture done right!Here is my personal story. I was two years old when this motion picture was first released so my introduction to it came first via B/W television broadcast, the color TV, and then later as VHS and DVD. Along the way I was also exposed to less well made Sci-Fi fare and even then this picture stood out as a favorite of mine. Thomas Frazier (Garfield Goose and Family Classics on WGN) would introduce this picture and I would turn out every light in the house and turn up the volume.As a young boy of 12 years old, watching this highly intelligent, yet very accessible drama I was terrified as perhaps many of you were by the Id, enthralled by the Krell. The story gave me a much better appreciation of the role 'science' could play in telling a story of human dimension and scope. While the obligatory and obvious monochromatic (racial and ethnic) stereotypes typical of the age are now glaringly apparent, the time honored human themes of lust for power, ambition, greed, and jealousy are woven into this film with great skill.Yes, my first crush was of course on the blond and so very alluring Anne Francis. What young man hoping to one day travel the cosmos wouldn't dream to find out there an intelligent, sexy, and beautiful (but not so innocent) maid simply waiting to be taken away from her domineering and overbearng parent. It was not embarrassing to admit that when Anne Francis (who is by the way a very accomplished actress) played her role as Honey West on TV, I was much older and well on my way to seeing more of what the character Jerry (Nielsen's second in command) was after.There are few movies I recommend as highly as ""Forbidden Planet"" when asked for a Sci-Fi rental pick. The three man crew concept born in this film (Capitan, Doctor, and First Officer) is immediately recognized by  every Star Trek fan on the planet. The character blend and dynamics are a bit different in this film, but this formula put a focus and a thread of action to this drama that was a break-through at the time. And don't forget the portable communication devices... the early 'phasers'.. the 'transporters' .. and the idea of FTL (faster-than-light) travel.. When you watch Forbidden Planet today, it's all to easy to forget these concepts were totally new to movie audiences of the 1950's.Also, to any budding radio and electronics's buff of the early 60's Robby was an absolute delight. It wasn't until I had read Issac Asimov's ""I Robot"" that I stopped seeing Roby as the apex of human engineering marvels. When I first learned programming on an IBM 360, I affectionately called the CPU 'Roby II'.If you buy this DVD and simply watch it, in time many of your own delights at it's drama and action will become part of your own rich set of motion picture memories. It's worth very penny of the price.P.S.  Since The Day The Earth Stood Still is coming out soon, I know they are destined to release a remake of this picture, so here is my vote for the new actors and their character roles:Altair --  Jessica Alba/Grace Park/BeyonceDr. Morbius --  Morgan FreemanCaptain Adams -- Jeffery DonnavanDoc  --  ? (but preferably a woman)Jerry Farmer ---- Benjamin Bratt"	5.0	This is the Classic Sci-Fi Moview That You'll Want To Say You Saw	2008-09-07	0	0	0

It is somewhat crude in its special effects by todays standards but it is a solid adaptation of Shakespeare's play updated for a 50's audience. The premise and movie stall hold up today, 40+ years later. It is a thoroughly enjoyable movie with the evil being more subtle than in today's movies. Anne Francis, Walter Pigeon, Earl Hollister's comic relief and Leslie Neilsen's all turn in good performances. Also, &#34;Robbie the Robot's&#34; debut is a landmark.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	ARLXJXMPVKK36	Randel B. Smith	"Forbidden Planet deserves all of the praise accorded it by my fellow reviewers. Please allow me to submit for your viewing pleasure a brief list of things to watch for during this film.We are all familiar with producer Irwin Allen's TV series like Lost in Space and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.  Many of the cool design features in these TV series were lifted directly from Forbidden Planet.  I don't know if this was Allen's idea or that of his production designers.  Here are a few items to watch for and compare  in his TV shows.In Forbidden Planet we see the first use of a saucer shaped U.S. space craft, (called  cruiser C-57-D) which inspired the design of the Jupiter 2 in Lost In Space.  The ""Astro-gater"" on board said saucer, a glass domed device with a moving mini-saucer inside it to simulate the ship's position in space, is copied for the same purpose in the Jupiter 2- it is the cool floor-standing machine in the middle of the main deck!  Notice the landing gear of the saucer incorporates steps inside each of the legs- and so do the Jupiter 2's.  Robby obviously inspired the robot on the same show, not to mention the ""freezing tubes""  for crew suspended animation; and the Robinsons even have outdoor forcefield projectors just like the ones in Forbidden Planet!In the TV series The Time Tunnel, the overall design of the whole complex, with it's view of a canyon-deep, multi-story underground city, is lifted directly from the same construction of the Krell.  The wide-shot used in Tunnel's first episode, of the tunnel itself, is a matte shot using the same artistic style as that in Forbidden Planet.  Look at how the lights are handled as they give us a disappearing perspective.Forbidden Planet is also famous for it's sound-music track which exclusively used  the Therimin electronic sound instrument, used earlier to great spooky effect in The Day the Earth Stood Still.  But did you know that the device was invented in Communist Russia in the 1920's?  When the inventor, Therimin, would come to the U.S. to demonstrate it in concerts, he conducted espionage against our country on behalf of the NKVD, Stalin's spy agency.  Nice guy, huh?An almost ""sister"" film, is Universal's big budget blockbuster This Island Earth, which features several design elements in common with Forbidden Planet:  More plexiglass ""freezing tubes"", a saucer shaped ship and a tram ride to show off the marvels of the alien civilization.Irwin Allen had no monopoly on borrowing from Forbidden Planet, either.  Whether by design or accident Star Trek may have done the same thing.  Leslie Nielsen's crew scans the planet Altair 4  for structures and other signs of civilization just as the Enterprise uses it's 'ship's sensors' to do the same thing.  When landing his ship Leslie Nielsen looks into microscope-and-viewer type instruments in much the same way Spock uses his science bay station on the bridge of  the Enterprise.Have any of you ever noticed  how many of the set pieces and props turned up in other studios production's and even TV shows?  Look for things like the Krell power gauges and the crewmen's uniforms on programs like The Twilight Zone, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and many, many other ""B"" sci-fi pictures made after 1956.  I recall that the flying saucer that lands on Agnes Moorhead's roof in one episode of Twilight Zone is the miniature of the U.S. space cruiser from Forbidden Planet.  She takes an Axe to it !  (Fortunately you can tell in that shot that it is a different model that is shown chopped up- thou shalt not mess up a rented prop!)I'm sure many of you can find even more things copied from this wonderful, ground-breaking film which have been used in other productions.

The story line seems plausible and is enchanting (based on a well-known play), the acting splendid, and the special effects outstanding! And to view the video in stereo is the frosting on the cake. I first saw this movie in the theatre back in '56 or '57 when it came out, but with the new sound effects, the  audio is amazing.  The 'music score' for this production of course were the tonalities of the prototype of what would later be known as the Moog Synthesizer.  And it's effect is superb.  When I first saw this movie, I couldn't believe what I had just seen, and that wonder has remained with me ever since.  And it's amusing to see such celebraties as Leslie Nielsen, Anne Francis, Warren Stevens et al when they were 'no-names', just beginning their acting careers.  Anyone who is a sci-fi nut HAS to own this for  their collection.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A31U2QT7SAL7K	"Reginald D. Garrard ""the G-man"""	&quot;Classic&quot; is a term brandished about too frequently but &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; is a film worthy of that recognition. This is an intelligent, well-written, and paced well with few lapses in action. The special effects, while dated in comparison to today's computer-generated wonders, are still impressive.Walter Pidgeon, who during the 40's had starred in several popular MGM films, adds just the right amount of authority to his role as the enigmatic Dr. Morbius. Leslie Nielson, who would later garner greater fame in his sidesplitting comic roles of the 80's and 90's, is present in all his &quot;leading man/serious&quot; glory.The electronic score by Bebe and Louis Baron is a one-of-a-kind listening experience, otherworldly and provocative. It is obviously a work that provided 50's movie patrons with something unheard of before.Besides the previously mentioned actors, the movie also features performers who would later regularly appear on primetime television: Jack Kelly (&quot;Maverick&quot;), Earl Holliman (Angie Dickinson's boss on &quot;Police Woman&quot;), Anne Francis (the 60's &quot;Honey West&quot;), Richard Anderson (&quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;), James Drury (TV's long running &quot;The Virginian&quot;) and in a very small role, James Best who would later find fame on &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;.	5.0	Holds up well after all these years!	2003-01-19	9	9	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2L7WYA5OENV03	Reticuli	First off, those of you complaining about the stretched out video transfer need to educate yourselves on DVD. It's called anamorphic and allows more of the MPEG-2 video codec to be used for the picture itself in very widescreen formats. If you don't have a 16:9 television, you need to go into the video options menu of your DVD player (not the DVD's menu, mind you) and tell it you're using a 4:3 aspect ratio display. As for the color hues and sound, I don't own the DVD, so I can't say. Somehow I find it unlikely that a major studio's video mastering would be paltry, but who knows.Now for the film itself: Forbidden Planet blew me away. Human beings in the future using flying saucers. Realistic jargon. Believable military behavior and procedures. Scenes that have been used in countless other sci-fi movies, including Total Recall and Star Wars. I even noticed that David Lynch copied some of the costumes and props for his version of Dune (uniforms, rifles, gun fire, onboard microphone handset, etc). Leslie Nielsen plays a very convincing captain of the military vessel. The crew is much more at ease with each other than you see in most science fiction where there's a command structure. Then, we have the stunning Anne Francis who's got a face to die for. The plot has excellent pacing and it never gives away too much too soon, even going so far as to never show us certain unnecessary elements at all. This is definitely a must see.	5.0	Great Science Fiction	2002-09-07	9	8	1

I'm not going to give any hints or spoilers but when the mystery is revealed it is stunning and mindblowing. The special effects are well ahead of their time (it was released in 1956). Scenes and plot devices were later used in Star Trek and Star Wars It is scary and dark with deep psychological themes.It also features a futuristic score made up of electronic sounds often imitated but never surpassed.

The acting is wooden otherwise (though I liked Anne Francis a lot in &quot;Bad Day At Black Rock&quot;), the direction uninspired (by the man who gave you &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot;). Obviously prepoduction costs got so out of hand that the studio saved money on actors and director. (Try to imagine Robert Wise as director ... or better don't.)The story: a scientist's subconscious gives birth to a monster that roams the planet, while (or because) his innocent daughter falls in love with a space commander and encounters the marvels and perils of puberty. Don't let any Krell hear that this is to be considered an intelligent plot - this is pure fairy tale, with all its innocent wonders, but also all its naivity and restrictions. The erotic implications - and we're talking about the main subject here - are so much suppressed (because of aiming at a younger audience) in favor of technical Schnickschnack and pseudo-scientific explanations that &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; doesn't reach the erotic dreamlike qualities of &quot;King Kong&quot; or &quot;Creature From The Black Lagoon&quot;. Critical for a film whose complete first hour consists of exposition.Fair enough to say that &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; inspired numerous space operas and SF TV series, it even contains a shot that bears remarkable similarity to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssee&quot;. (Compare the interior shot of the Krell's subway glider with the scenes in the space pod in the last act of &quot;2001&quot;.) Robby the robot reappeared in &quot;The Invisible Boy&quot; and (slightly altered) in the Czech &quot;Ikaria XB1&quot;, a serious, &quot;adult&quot; space adventure released with 20 minutes missing as &quot;Voyage To The End Of The Universe&quot; in the US.Picture and sound quality of the DVD transfer deserve an A, despite some spots during the reel changes of the celluloid original. You also get a widescreen and a fullscreen version on one disc, although probably hardly anybody cares for the latter. No extras except for the movie trailer, but thankfully no 10 minute long trailer show of contemporary releases before the start of the main movie, either (hear that, MGM Midnite Movies?).This is the right stuff if you liked &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, &quot;This Island Earth&quot; or George Pal's movies. If you tend more towards &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;, &quot;Invasion Of The Body Snatchers&quot; or the &quot;Quatermass&quot; series, think twice.	2.0	One for the heart	2001-11-11	7	4	3

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3S5N9FDESFPS7	R. Ludwig	"This is one of the best SciFi movies of all time (#1 being ""The Day The Earth Stood Still""). Based (loosely) on Shakespeare's play ""The Tempest"", it brings together an outstanding cast (look at the cast list) to tell the story of genius ultimately controlled, then destroyed, by the ""mindless primitive"". The special effects are astounding; espcially for the time. I find the electronic music to be sometimes distracting and there are places where it's impossible to tell if the sound you are hearing is a monster, wind in the rocks, or the soundtrack.  The movie, with its award winning special effects and soundtrack and its fine cast of actors appears to be quite rough in places (more on that later) but this is the way the movie was made. The acting is quite good. Walter Pidgeon is perfect as Morbius. Leslie Nielsen as Adams does a credible job in a dramatic role (but you can't help slipping to ""Naked Gun""). I won't run down the rest of the cast except to say that Earl Holliman is, at best, light comedic relief; I could never figure out why he was really in this movie.The disc set containts the movie, specials, and trailers on one disc with ""The Invisible Boy"" (which I have not yet seen) on the second. One special is a set of ""lost"" footage which is really a set of test shots of scenery but which is really quite interesting (watch as the camera moves around the planet and note that it looks like you are really circling a planet and not looking at a prop)The other special contains scenes that were shot but not part of the original release. A couple of notes here. There is one scene of Adams dressing down three of his officers just after the communications officer is killed. The disc has that as a deleted scene and it is missing from the movie on this disc but that scene is included in every version of this movie I have ever seen. Another deleted scene is the ""unicorn explanation"" that I have never seen but that perfectly explains why Altaira has the affinity for animals that she does and why the tiger must later be killed. I had already surmised the reason but this was the actual confirmation (after 50 years!!). There is also a scene that seems to be rewritten on the disc (where Morbius asks Altaira to deny her love for Adams. When I watched the disc she just stands there but I recall her as saying something to the effect ""No, not even if I could"").One of the specials also describes how the movie was apparently left roughly cut to rush it to general release instead of waiting for a finished product.  I'd always wondered why there were obvious cuts in the film; now I know.I bought this set to fill in my collection of great, old, classic, SciFi films. And, while I have seen the film at least 50 times, I still enjoy it and I still see something interesting in the special effects or the sets.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	Forbidden Planet (Fred Wilcox, 1956)Interesting how much debate there is over whether this is a great film or not. I've been following it, admittedly halfheartedly, on the IMDB fora for about a month now. And both sides have some very good points. From the standpoint of moviemaking, it does wear its B-movie origins on its sleeve. The acting is competent at best and mawkish most of the time. The direction isn't awful, but it's certainly nothing inspiring (though this can be said of most sci-fi films; Alien and Bladerunner are the exception, not the rule). The script, which borrows liberally from both Shakespeare and Asimov, sounds more like a dime novel than either of its supposed forebears. Still, I can't deny that all that pales in comparison to the atmosphere that Fred Wilcox (Lassie Come Home) and his crew cooked up for this movie.The plot: Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen in his second big-screen role) and his rather small crew have travelled to a planet where a colony had set down twenty years before, never to be heard from again. When they get there, they discover the colony's sole survivor, Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), and his beautiful daughter Altaira (Anne Francis). Unfortunately, they also discover something else-- the something else that killed the rest of the colonists.It's a pretty skinny plot, but you're not watching this movie for the plot. Much of what became standard, if not clich&eacute;, in the science fiction realm (thanks to the many knockoffs of this movie that followed, as well as the Twilight Zone television series, which reused many of the film's props and sets over the years) emerged here. And, yeah, a lot of it does look clich&eacute; now, especially if you're a big fan of Twilight Zone. But if you can think about it as a lot of tropes that had never, at the time, been seen before, you may be able to catch a glimpse of the magic here.  In fact, that so much of the film has become clich&eacute; in the ensuing four decades should tip you off to just how profoundly influential it's been. Couple that with the B-movie script-- and one thing you can say for B-movies, they were usually well-paced and fun, if shallow-- and the movie does still hold up very well after all this time. Bottom line, it's a lot of fun. ****	4.0	"""So, Timmy, have you ever been stuck in a hostile environment?"""	2008-03-10	1	0	1
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1QW1D1SCXFYG7	Robert Butterfield	This classic from 1956 shows its age a bit now but is still first rate.  It was all filmed on a sound stage.  I think it was Leslie Nielsen's first picture.  The special effects are excellent and the matte work by Disney's Josh Meador create an eerie mood that highlights and enhances the story.  The Blu-ray version is excellent and adds much needed depth to the proceedings.  This is one of my favorite all time Science-Fiction epics.

I think all the actors are (like the Krell) mostly dead now but their work will live on now in this classic film.Altair 4 is a beautiful little green world 22 light years from earth.  It was there some 20 years in the past that Dr. Edward Morbius, (Walter Pidgeon) his wife and crew of the Belleraphon began to explore this world.  Millions of years ago it was the home of the Krell, a wise an noble race of beings that had been wiped out in a single night.Commanded by John J. Adams, (Leslie Nielson) the space crusier C-57D and her crew arrives from earth to check on the situation here.  They are greeted by a robot (Robby ) who is fluent in 188 languages and is more advanced than all of earth's sciences could have created, However, Morbius insistes it is only a useful toy.Commander Adams meets, then falls in love with Morbius' daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) who has a way with animals and, except for her father, has never seen an earth man before.  It then an unseen force begins to kill the crew of the C-57D one by one, just as it had on the Belleraphon crew 22 years in the past.This film seems to be ageless, despite the 57 years of advances in technology.  Gene Roddenberry was so impressed by it, he used it as a template for the series Star Trek. The film's development is far beyond the typical monsters from space as the 1950's film industry had been cranking out (ie. Creature From the Black Lagoon etc. etc.).And so I find myself many years later buying a copy of the 50th anniversary edition and being excited about having it.  I wonder how many generations of us will continue to enjoy the movie.  Perhaps, in years to come, our descendants may actually visit the world of the Krell.	5.0	Robby, emergency cancellation Archimedes	2013-06-18	0	0	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	This is one of those wonderful works of science fiction:  it both stretches the imagination and reflects the time in which it was made.  The plot revolves around a rescue mission, to a colony that has been silent for 20 years.  Upon arrival, the crew discover a series of mysteries:  while nearly the entire original crew was mysteriously murdered, a single man (Morbius) was miraculously immune, as was his daughter.  The survivors are served by a fantastic robot, Robby, one the original scifi creations that I remember as a child, who is far beyond the science of man to create.  Then there is the hidden menace, which slowly reveals itself as a being that seems to defy the laws of physics.Morbius, of course, is the key to these mysteries, but he is stubborn and convinced of his moral rectitiude as he chooses himself as the guardian of an ancient extraterrestrial culture.  A fateful battle of wills follows with the captain, for whom Morbius' daughter has fallen.  The solution to all the mysteries come together in a wonderfully unforeseen conclusion, which surprises as well as reflects the then-popular Freudian psychanalysis of the time.  It is simply brilliant, both in its themes and its technical execution.  This story will live in my imagination for my entire life.  It is still worth seeing.Warmest recommendation.	5.0	classic high concept scifi	2005-01-23	0	0	0

In fact elements of this movie have been the genesis of ideas used in sifi movies and tv shows i.e light speed, high powered laser weapons, plantary exploration, robots, peronsal communication devices, scientific genius, security officer, terrifying monsters, and vanished advance civilizations that eveloved into extinction.  In fact tmany of hese elements reminds me of Star Trek.  You won't be diappointed.	5.0	Comment on Forbidden Planet movie	2013-05-14	0	0	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"As is well known, this is a Sci-fi film loosely based on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST meeting Freud's theories of the Id.  But this would count for nothing if the film weren't so extremely well done in other ways.Although not working with an especially large budget, the makers of the film combined a good story with amazingly innovative set design and clever special effects to produce what is possibly the most satisfying film set in outer space film made during the 1950s.  Shot entirely on a soundstage, the exterior shots of the planet manage to avoid looking at all hokey, and the house in which Dr. Morbius and his daughter Altaira live, despite looking pure 1950s, manages to somehow seem right at home.  The shots of the interior of the former inhabitants' magnificent structures are some of the best model shots in film history.  Even with today's special effects and CGI scripting, they are impressive.  And Robby the Robot has to go down as one of the great screen robots of all time.  Also among the all time greats, the invisible but nonetheless detectable ""monster from the ID"" is one of the most satisfying monsters one could imagine.  Almost all movie monsters from the fifties disappoint, at seem to some degree a bit silly, but not this one.Part of the reason the movie works so well is the cast, which is a cut above average for a fifties Sci-fi flick.  Leslie Nielsen was thirty years away from his debut as a comedian, and plays what was his usual character for the first half of his film career:  a solid if a bit too serious lead.  Walter Pidgeon turns in the strongest performance in the film, as the brilliant Dr. Morbius.  His voice alone makes many of the key scenes in the film work beautifully.  Anne Francis is simply beautiful, and it doesn't take much imagination the effect she would have on a ship full of men who haven't seen a woman in several months.  She manages to be incredibly sexy and completely innocent as successfully as any actress I have ever seen.One can overstress the Shakespeare and Freud connection, but this film does get my vote for the best use of psychology ever made in a Sci-fi film.  It along with the extreme care given to every aspect of this film make it to this day one of the most durable Sci-fi films ever made."	5.0	Fun = Freud, Shakespeare, and Space	2003-05-13	2	2	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2HA12N0J4XKYW	ROBERT REESE	"As soon as I heard the ""electronic tonalities"" accompanying the opening credits, I knew this was going to be a great movie.  I still enjoy listening to that strange sound that perfectly set the mood for a futuristic adventure, there has never been any better.It's often said that the script was based on Shakespeare's ""The Tempest,"" well maybe...but very loosely.  But it was certainly a tightly written and logical story.  As a nine-year old I didn't understand what became of the monster, but that just made it more interesting when I saw it again many years later.The special effects were good for the time and still hold up OK today.  But I dread going to see the remake.  Somehow I suspect that so much will have to be changed to fit in with today's ideals.  Such as:  Altaira will have to be more of a ""Zena the Warrior Princess"" type and not a sex object, so as not to offend the femminists.  The remake would probably also contain dark conspiracies and lots of gratuitous sex and violence.  Of course Robby would have to be black.I know why this movie became such a classic for me: To own my own planet, complete with ancient civilization to explore, and a robot companion--what more could any nine-year old boy ask for?  That leaves Altaira.  I didn't know why, but even back then I thought it would be nice to keep her around.  I was certainly right about that!"	5.0	I Was Right!	2004-12-08	11	9	2

However, that being said, this is probably the greatest science fiction film of the 1950's.

It was made in the 1950's, when the young girls wore short skirts, just because (I don't know if they ever had any explanation as to why, they just did). And some of the dialogue is, well a bit stilted, but that was common during that period of time. Just overlook it. The ideas presented of an advanced race which climbed to the pinnacle of its existence and the wiped themselves over, is mysterious and chilling.

You have to compare it to any other sci-fi movie of the 50`s and 60's to see how ingenious and original this was and how much care and attention was put into the making of it at a time when sci-fi was relegated to cheap and hokey B-movies.

I saw it several times at a downtown Columbus theatre that  catered to kids and opened each summer season with this movie on a double feature with BLACKBOARD JUNGLE, another contemporary MGM blockbuster.Today, it looks somewhat quaint, but is entertainingly nostalgic; not the classic that everyone says it is. The special effects were great for '56, and the animated monster and futuristic score were really impressive.  But a lot of it is pretty boring and talky.  I offers a good good look at Leslie Neilsen before he was the goofball comic in his later years.I have the laser disc, a high def version, and now the blu ray, all bought during sales over the past 20 years.

The single-disc transfer is fine, but to own a remastered version in 5.1 surround with all the special features is very tempting.Of course, those into sci-fi know this to be one, if not THE mother of all sci-fi classics.  Ranking along side pictures like: The Day the Earth Stood Still, (the original) War of the Worlds, (George Pal's) Time Machine, and the like.  Of them all, this one may be my favorite.  The story (based on Shakespeare's Tempest) is excellent, the acting is top notch, and the FXs hold up amazingly well.I maybe somewhat bias however.  As a boy, I had a serious crush on the curvaceous Ms. Anne Francis and never missed an episode of her short-lived series (Honey West) when it aired in the mid sixties.  Oh, and let's not forget that this was Robby the Robot's film debut.  He may be the most enduring icon from the early sci-fi era.  Robby seems to pop up on occasion just to put smiles on our faces.  From: (the original series) Lost in Space, The Twilight Zone, to Mork & Mindy, and Earth Girls are Easy, he's libel to show up anywhere.Well, I suppose that's enough reminiscing.

Lots of the action sequences might be considered to be cheesy by younger viewers, but I'm almost 80 and have been a fan forever, it seems, so I've watched special effects grow and mature with CG. Robbie the Robot went on to star in the TV show, &#34;Lost in Space,&#34; among other things. No CG, so Robbie was operated by human inside with, what seems now, as special effects that were then state-of-the-art.This BD version was sharp and clear images with excellent sound.	5.0	Classic Sci Fi.	2013-10-10	0	0	0

A spaceship from the Earth arrives to his planet-island and try to investigate the origin of the invisible and destructive force that provoked the vanishing of the others members of the expedition that travelled with Dr. Morbius.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2I1UGAN0M9DZZ	Sandro Menzel	This is classic 1950's science fiction at its best. The plot plays a lot like an old Star Trek episode -- the crew journeys to a seemingly safe planet; they encounter trouble and have to figure out the problem in order to get away with their lives.Leslie Nielson, Walter Pigeon and Anne Francis put in great performances. Seeing a much younger Leslie Nielson in a more serious role is refreshing. Forbidden Planet was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957 for Best Special Effects but lost out to the other film nominated in the category, The Ten Commandments. The electronic score is truly out-of-this-world and really makes the movie.I particularly enjoyed the painted scenery/backdrops and the laser fire drawn onto the film (sometimes not lined up quite right) as well as the movie poster (DVD cover) not being quite true to the story line. After you've seen the movie, check it out and you'll see what I mean.The story was fun, though definitely dated. If you enjoy old science fiction, then this is a good movie for you. Don't expect the plot to be too deep or thought-provoking, though the premise of the movie does give something to think about. This is a fun, entertaining movie from the 50'.The DVD doesn't have much in the way of extras. There's just a theatrical trailer that gives away too much of the film.This is a classic science fiction movie that I could easily watch again (several times).Recommend: YesWatch again: Yes	5.0	Classic 50's Science Fiction	2003-05-01	15	14	1

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2YYK67XIW6WS2	"S. BARRY ""jimmer72"""	"It saddens me to write this, as Warners did an awesome job at least in packaging this 50th Anniversary Edition of FORBIDDEN PLANET... it's what is included (and NOT included) that leads me to give this Special Edition only 3 stars at best.  I hate to nit-pick, but considering that I and many others have waited since the original 1998 DVD release for a full-blown re-do from Warner Brothers, this new release leaves a lot to be desired.First off:  NO COMMENTARIES!  At all!  Historian Rudy Behlmer is on hand for the documentary, but no commentary???  Not even with Leslie Nielsen, Anne Francis, or any of the still-living actors seen in the ""Amazing"" documentary?  How about one from at least all the modern-day special effects gurus who are also seen on the documentary?  Simply unforgivable.Second:  The main documentary, ""Amazing!"" is a scant 25-30 minutes long!  Haven't I been reading for months that this doc would be ""feature-length?""  Sorry folks... feature-length, to me, means AT LEAST 70 minutes long.  Actors that you could have sworn had long passed, like Richard Anderson, Earl Holliman and Warren Stevens, are given scant face-time, and Anderson literally only gets about 10 seconds!!!  This is ""Oscar Goldman,"" for cryin' out loud!  Oh sure, the modern-day directors, FX masters and writers fall all over themselves about the special effects and Robby the Robot, but where's the human element in all this?  How did the principal actors all get involved in the film in the first place?  What were their feelings during the production towards the material?  Did they know it was good, or did they think it was cheesy?  Did they all get along, or were all the male actors vying for the attention of Anne Francis?  How was the director (Fred McLeod Wilcox) to work with... a saint, a jerk, what?  This element is SORELY lacking from the proceedings.Third:  Picture quality.  Yes, it's marginally clearer than the '98 MGM release, but am I the only one who thinks the picture still looks somewhat washed-out, with the infamous ""yellow-layer"" seemingly deteriorated?  The colors just don't seem to pop right out at you, unlike most other glorious MGM releases, like SINGIN' IN THE RAIN or THE WIZARD OF OZ... reds, yellows and greens seem oddly muted.  It just feels like more work could have been done for optimal picture quality.  Perhaps there was no master negative to work with?  Again, it could have been easily explained had a commentary track been added.Fourth:  Extras.  The lobby cards are cool, but the ones for THE INVISIBLE BOY are superfluous... sure, it's neat to have the film included, but that's purely a novelty at this point.  Also, the Robby the Robot action figure is a disappointment as well:  It's really only a dinky, painted statue; no movable joints, and poor Robby will be dwarfed by Princess Leia if you stick him of the shelf with your other sci-fi trinkets.All in all, it's still nice to have ANY kind of Special Edition of FORBIDDEN PLANET in your collection, and the packaging that comes with the tin case is suitably retro, colorful and fun to look at, but this new release could have been SO MUCH more.  A shame.  Guess we'll have to wait until 2016 and the 60th Anniversary Edition for a more substantial, well-rounded release."	3.0	50th Anniversary Edition is a HUGE disappointment!	2006-11-14	96	84	12

This review is solely forForbidden Planet [Blu-ray] and not the earlier DVD release or the two disc anniversary edition. I have no idea why Amazon cannot fix this as they say it is product review.Anyway the Blu Ray edition is great! The transfer is spectacular, it's almost like seeing for the first time. The special features are very good, even though a cherished 'myth' is shattered (I won't give it away.This movie was highly influential in many ways; it was the first SciFi movie put out by a major studio as an A feature. The special effects for the era were a very big deal. The sound track was entirely electronic (so much so that the Musicians Union made MGM list them as 'acoustic tonalities' so that they could not be nominated for 'music' awards).The film was a major influence on Gene Roddenberry for Star Trek and you can see the influence on later film makers in many ways.All in all I highly recommend the Blu Ray editon.	5.0	A Great Look Back Into The Future	2011-01-29	7	6	1

Despite the warnings of Dr. Morbius, a spacecruiser insists on landing on Altair-4 to investigate the planet and what happened to the rest of Dr. Morbius' original colleagues. Dr. Morbius now lives alone on the planet save for his daughter and his robot named Robby.  But there is a malevolent presence on the planet, both mysterious and invisible.The film stars Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius, Anne Francis as his daughter, and Leslie Nielsen as the daring spacecruiser Commander. It boasts the first ever all-electronic score, that certainly adds to the eerie ambiance and adds suspense. Unfortunately, the balance was a bit off - the electronic noises got very tedious and had to be turned down, while the dialog had to be turned up. It was a lot of fun to spot what possible inspiration spawned other favorite scifi technology, such as the Star Trek transporter beams. This classic is a must-see for science fiction fans, as it helped pave the way for future scifi.	4.0	SciFi Classic on Blu-Ray	2010-09-21	2	1	1

FORBIDDEN PLANET offers the viewer an exceptionally intelligent script, fine direction and excellent acting by the entire cast who are threatened by a strange being on an exotic planet. In the year 22OO A.D., commander Leslie Nielson lands his United Planets Cruiser C-57D on Altair-4 where the sky is green the sand is pink, and two moons circle above...For its day, the technical achievements for the film were astounding. It was the first science fiction film produced by a major studio (M-G-M) for a million dollars. The eerie musical score, the atmosphere, even the odd Eastmancolor all add to the film's immense enjoyment. The film is essentially (and rather ingeniously) a futuristic variation/fantasia on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST: an undeniably brilliant excursion into outer space and the inner mind.	5.0	VINTAGE SCI-FI GENRE CLASSIC.	2002-09-25	4	4	0

The special effects, when compared to other films of the genre, simply blow  them out of the water when you consider the technology of the day. Many  movies about that time refer to the 1990's as the period when humanity  reached other stars or similar feats, but the realism of putting that  discovery nearly a century past that only helps to make it more realistic.  I strongly urge any sci-fi fan who has not seen this movie to go out and  rent, buy, or tape it off of AMC.	5.0	Attention to detail and timelessness	1999-08-26	2	1	1

The story hinges on a pair of intertwined mysteries: the overnight destruction of an incredibly advanced alien civilization, and the horrific killings of an earlier group of colonists on the same planet. The answers, when they come, are logical and satisfying, and a second viewing will show that fair clues were offered all along. The film offers much for the eye as well (be sure to get the widescreen version): wide-open landscapes with green twilit skies, a sleek flying saucer of a starship, alien forests of otherwordly trees, Dr. Morbius's elegant villa (where I want to live when I grow up), Ann Francis's short skirts, and a huge, enigmatic, alien machine. Don't come expecting an adrenaline rush, fist fights, dismemberments, or explosions; this film proceeds deliberately, inviting the viewer to think, from beginning to end. The performances are low-key, but appropriately so considering the nature of the characters. The electronic score is also decades ahead of its time.	5.0	The best of 50's sci-fi	2002-02-12	5	5	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A23M9DR4MAEEOT	simon cherpitel	The best thing about Forbidden Planet is the concept of the power of Freud's 'Id'. Otherwise, without the base on earth from the 1950s, such as in This Island Earth, War of the Worlds, It Came from Outer Space, The Day the Earth Stood Still & maybe The 27th Day, it lacks the charm of comparison with the era then, thus has to be compared with the 'total space' movies of the latter part of the century, like the original Star Wars - still the top of the genre, Alien & Star Trek II the Wrath of Khan. The best films of aliens or futuristic creations combined with earth settings, like Blade Runner, Solaris, Terminators 1&2, Starman, Dark City, or even the inner space of Tron from more contemporary times have a far more sophisticated resonance for repeated viewings. In sum, after seeing it again after many years, I found Forbidden Planet fairly boring & simply not very well done overall.	3.0	Forbidden Planet - interesting concept	2006-07-02	16	2	14

Its even more remarkable for being over 50 years old now, as some of the special effects, if dated now, are good enough to make you think 'how the hell did they do that in 1956'? Remember no CGI at all.Its influence on the original Star Trek series in terms of the story and the sets is clear for all to see: A long dead civilisation leaving behind a mind enhancing machine. An apparent Alien force that can't be seen. Sets made of polystyrene etc....Quite a few important Science Fiction films were made in the 1950's, but this one stands head and shoulders above the rest.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1AN4ZZ43SKLOE	Spooxster	"Watched this movie knowing nothing about it going in; part of my recent 1950's sci-fi kick.In this movie we follow a group of astronauts from the United Planets as they travel to distant planet Altair IV to do an evaluation on a scientist colony founded 20 years earlier.  It's notable that there are many distinguishing factors to this movie:  The spaceship is completely manmade, you never see 1 inch of Earth or anywhere from our native solar system, and there is no musical score.  In place of a traditional score, there is ""Electronic Tonality"" setting the scene.  I found this to mold perfectly with the atmosphere of the movie.Playing Commander John J. Adams is Leslie Nielson.  Born in the late 70's, I grew up only knowing Nielson from roles in movies like the ""Naked Gun"" trilogy, ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"", and similar spoofs. While the subject matter of this movie isn't quite as dire or all-encompassing as ""When Worlds Collide"", it was fascinating to see Leslie Nielson in this role, as he pulls it of famously.Opposite Nielson is Anne Francis' Altaira, the daughter of one of the colonizing scientists.  What we have here is the weakest link of the movie, albeit not necessarily at the hand of Ms. Francis. While understandable that since she was born on Altair IV, and therefore has never been around a shipload of real ""Earthmen"", AND accepting that this shipload of dudes have been in space for 378 days, the movie focuses a little too heavily on her dressing and more so acting like a sleaze.A third main character that must be paid attention:  Robby the Robot.  While still rigid like many sci-fi robots, Robby is much more mobile than expected and has a personality that refuses to be pure-camp and greatly adds to the overall feel and mood of the movie.The costumes/wardrobe is above average in quality and design, but the environments are the real catcher.  Excellent attention to detail in all locales and props, from the main spacecraft to a tractor to a sprawling, 280-floor megalopolis; fantastic use of all colors your retinas can handle; truly cutting edge special effects can be especially dazzling at times (the trouble at the perimeter scene), yet they all have a place in the film; none are used as just diluting extras.  The one glaring boo-boo I saw was sometimes when firing their purple-ray-shooting guns, the cosmonauts aren't even bothering to squeeze the trigger or push a button to activate them.  The techno-babble segments are informative, yet never drone their way to boredom.  Being a devout Trekkie I LOVE my technobabble, but this movie certainly could have crossed a line, but certainly does not.All put together, ""Forbidden Planet"" delivers a solid sci-fi experience that should be watched by any fan of the genre.  The information reveals and action sequences pace the movie wonderfully, with an ultimate revelation that is first-rate and thought-provoking.  Be sure to drop in and see the wonders of the Forbidden Planet!"	4.0	That is all...(possible very minor spoilers)	2013-05-10	1	1	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A203K9HA5QWIWE	Spottedfeather	Realized by many as the greatest sci-fi film of all time, Forbidden Planet comes in an amazing set. It has a ton of great bonus features like great documentaries, a wonderful show about the creation of the most iconic robot in history, Robby, and an episode of an old tv show in which Robby was the star. Also included is Robby's follow up film venture, The Invisible Boy. There are also interviews with the surviving members of the cast, though it is somewhat strange seeing how people have aged, much less shocking, though, if you've seen them in any recent movies/shows. Forbidden Planet has never looked so good ! The colours are incredibly vivid and the sound is amazing. All the classic sci-fi sound effects are here, and are at there best here as well. Probably the best extra is the small, greatly detailed, Robby The Robot figurine that comes with the set.If you're any kind of sci-fi fan at all, you have to get this 2 disc set. The movie will never look better than it does here. Even the HD-DVD can't look any better. The movie is 50 years old and HD won't make any difference in the picture quality. This is as good as it will ever be ! Get this set !!!	4.0	Yes !!!!!	2008-03-13	1	1	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3LXKO2S6G2DBI	"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant"""	Like all good film science fiction, &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; keeps its concepts simple but their ramifications grand, which is just one of the reasons it is a timeless classic.  Made at a time when sci-fi was the junk that kept restless kids in theater seats on Saturday afternoons, this ambitious take on Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot; nonetheless also aims for adults that grew up on the pulp fiction of the 1920s and 30s.  (Its delightful production design is a seamless mix of colors, forms, and shapes familiar from those imaginative magazine covers.)  The premise is Star Trek a decade before Star Trek, as a military cruiser commanded by the hard-nosed but humane J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen doing an effective melodramatic turn) visits a world populated by a secretive scholar (a wonderful Walter Pidgeon), his curious daughter (a sometimes grating Ann Francis), their robot butler (the epitome of mechanical men) and a mostly unseen terror (illustrated by topnotch Disney animators).  Beyond great special effects and an innovative musical score, the film also engages a firm--if now familiar--science fiction plot, unlike so many of the noisy and expensive but ultimately overwrought and empty-headed sci-fi movies of today.	5.0	Great Sci-Fi	2004-07-04	2	2	0

After watching you wish there were more adventures of the crew! but alas there were none. Mystery, Romance, Science Fiction all wrapped into one, while special effects are top rate with no flaws.

It is one of my favorite Sci Fi movies of all time. This remastered transfer of the film is breathtaking in it's clarity, detail, richness of color and sound.It is the best transfer of the film I have ever seen and gives one a glimpse of a film that must have been astonishing to see on the big screen in it's day.Even by today's CG standards of special effects this film delivers. In fact it surpasses CG effects because it has a uniqueness and beauty that CG has not yet been able to capture.The beautiful matte paintings of the planet and Krell machine works are truly awe inspiring. The acting is very good and the most important thing of all, the story, is truly riveting and instructive in it's scope and moral lesson.I recommend all people see this film. This collector set has many extras including a cool little Robby the robot toy.One warning to Amazon customers though. I ordered this collector set and had to return it twice because each time it arrived the tin collector case was dented in.I finally had to buy it at Best Buy because Amazon would not guarantee safe delivery. Yes I had to pay $20 more at Best Buy but it was worth it to have a collector set that was not damaged.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	ASCYVEQHFGYG0	Steven Camilleri	What a truly remarkable film this is. It scared me as a child, made me ponder on philosophy as a youth, and help give me understanding as an adult. Great science fiction films like Forbidden Planet don't just give  a couple of hours of entertainment, but make us think deep thoughts. But for others like myself this film cuts too close to the bone.Forget about blaming the world or circumstances for your ills or problems, for the rot truly lies within. Look at the soul destroying prognosis that the captain must force upon Morbius so as to reach the only possible conclusion, that the evil hideous monster that lures in the dark ripping his comrades limb from limb is actually HIM (Morbius) now ready to destroy the captain and his only daughter.Technology is neither good nor evil just neutral but people in a fit of rage will still smash their TV's, stereos, microwaves, etc if it does not work as expected, when will we ever learn that circumstances just reveal who we truly are. Two thousand years ago a unique man walked the earth, he spoke remarkable words and  did brave things that lead up to his death but never backed down from what he said. One of these things was what Morbius needed to hear.That man is basically evil in thoughts and deeds. But what God regards as evil intents and thoughts, man regards as natural and normal.I have seen some classic horror films like all of the Alien films and in these films who are the real monsters as Aliens 4 shows so well, the aliens, or the humans who would use fellow humans as hosts so as to use them for the military or bred an entirely new species part human part alien. Remember the shock of Ripey's face when she entered the medical lab to see what they are really up too.Thanks Forbidden Planet you have taught me a lot about myself....

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3M0YP958H2KRX	Steven K. Szmutko	"Unlike most 1950's Science Fiction movies, FORBIDDEN PLANET was more than just a bunch of ""monsters"" (read - guys in cheesy rubber suits) stalking the innocent space explorers (who have traveled billions of miles just to try to get home) and frightening young damsels in distress.  No, this one has an intelligent plot and excellent (for the time) special effects. Based on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST, the film has become the model of the high quality space drama.The cast is first rate with Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius, Anne Francis (daughter Altair), the inimitable Leslie Nielson as Commander Adams, and of course, Robby the Robot.  Mr. Nielson turns in a decent performance, although for fans of Airplane and the Naked Gun series, seeing him in a straight (rather than comedic) role may be a bit disconcerting.The restoration of the film is excellent.  Growing up, most of us only had the opportunity to watch worn out copies of the film on the Late, Late show with faded colors and massive editing.  The DVD offers pristine video and audio and, in its entirety, the nuances of the plot can be fully appreciated.  The two-disc version has a nice package of extras including THE INVISIBLE BOY, a pleasant, if unassuming movie featuring Robby the Robot.Lots of Fun!"	5.0	50's SciFi at Its Best	2007-03-22	3	2	1

There are others we love (I myself have a great and abiding fondness for I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE, and some folks swear by WAR OF THE WORLDS), but these five, though they did not exhaust the genre (as Hollywood understood the genre), certainly defined it during their decade and well into the 1960s, until 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.	5.0	Essential science-fiction cinema	2006-03-21	5	3	2

Some of the acting is a little cheesy at points, but for the most part well done.  Walter Pidgeion nails his role to perfection!  I remember seeing this movie as a little boy.  I had to have a Robby the Robot toy the minute they came out.  The creature stalking the planet kept me awake at night for a week.  I view this movie and the 1953 release of War of the Worlds as true landmarks in the science fiction genre of movies.  Most science fiction pictures from this era were black and white, B grade and lower, with little budgets and poor to even laughable special effects or monsters.  These two films pushed the quality bar way up and proved you could make a decent science fiction movie on par with other films from that time period.  A MUST HAVE for any science fiction movie buff.  There has been talk for many years of Hollywood doing a remake.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A256MHR5YKNF06	StuartR	There were a few classic sci fi movies from the 50's and this is by all considerations one of them. A masterful reworking of the Tempest, this movie broke new ground with cinematography and futurism, made even more amazing by a comparison with todays computer generated animation. On all levels this movie is a work of genius, from the set design (incorporating art from modernist masters), to the sweeping landscaping backgrounds (reminiscent of the artwork for contemporary sci fi novels), to the robotics (the famous Robbie the Robot), all of this accompanied by the brilliant score and music by Louis and Bebe Barron (and the eerie and soulful use of the theramin).At its heart, a simple morality play, but with many layers of human aberrant psychological fears, greed and hubris, this is an event best viewed in widescreen Blu-Ray format. Yes, by comparison with Avatar and Start Wars, the movie wants for spectacular action, however, its naivete and earnestness has its own appeal. When this movie is viewed by a 21st century audience, there are levels of specific relevance with current fears of apocalypse and global doom, that are quite different to the fears of atomic oblivion faced by its 50's audience. This is its charm, as its general theme can be accessed and understood by a modern contemporary audience. From masterful acting by Leslie Neilsen acting as a romantic hero lead, and Anne Francis as the virginal innocent/provocateur whos innocence and humility finally sets the scene for the resolution of mans arrogance and conceit as portrayed by Walter Pidgeon, this is a ensemble cast.The screenplay is tight and absent of glaring science errors (that usually damaged other sci fi movies, no flying vampire monsters, or rubber masks here), this is a movie that can be watched over and over without feeling foolish.I would recommend this to any lover of the genre.	5.0	Classic	2011-05-25	1	1	0

What made it unusual at that time was the big budget (several millions of dollars) it was given to film. M-G-M was determined to show that when money was no longer an object a &#34;Space Movie&#34; could be done with intelligence and the highest production values possible at the time. Forbidden Planet is a movie where every single dollar they spent is clearly visible onscreen, during every one of its 98 minutes runtime. This movie also made a star of Robby the Robot, and to this day he remains a cherished icon of the Golden Age of Sci-Fi movies. Use the search engine of your choice and look him up, you will understand why almost 60 years later Robby remains so popular. Forbidden Planet looks amazing on Blu-ray, and I recommend that if possible you see this on the biggest Flat Panel screen available, for maximum effect!	5.0	A Sci-Fi Classic for the Ages!	2013-07-19	0	0	0

I was excited to see it in the Blu-ray format, and I wasn't disappointed.  The film looks spectacular, and the special effects -- state of the art at the time -- still look magnificent.Robby the Robot, of course, came away from this film a huge star, and it's fun to see him again.  You might be interested to know that the voice of Robby is actor Marvin Miller, who played the executive secretary of an eccentric wealthy man who, each week, gave away one million dollars tax-free on the TV show, ""The Millionaire.""Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen (playing it straight... this was well before his days as a comedy star in such films as ""Airplane!) star.  Included in this release is the feature film, ""The Invisible Boy,"" a follow-up film that capitalized on the popularity of Robby the Robot but had nothing to do with ""Forbidden Planet.""A sequel to ""Forbidden Planet"" was never made.  This big-budget epic, filmed in color, was MGM's first venture into the then emerging popularity of science fiction.  Most sci-fi pictures of the 1950's were black & white, low-budget efforts.  Only a few were made in color.  This and ""War of the Worlds"" are the most famous and best color sci-fi features of the Eisenhower era."	5.0	A Science Fiction Classic	2010-11-12	6	6	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2VUD4SPJO4V33	Theo	"Forbidden Planet is perhaps the pre-eminent work of 1950s science fantasy. It is not by any stretch of the imagination hard science fiction, but it is a thoughtful and intelligent offering in its own way.Famously (but very loosely) based on Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"", this is a movie where there are as many potential layers of meaning as you want to find. With Morbius cast as Prospero, and Prospero in turn very likely based on the Elizabethan magus Dr. John Dee, co-creator of the Enochian magical language, is it really a co-incidence that Morbius is himself a linguist?There is much more that I'd like to say here, but I'm holding back for the sake of those who are not already familiar with the film. I don't want to give away any spoilers. For those who have seen the film, and who feel inclined towards such exercises, I'll just ask this: to whom - or what - would you assign the respective roles of Ariel and Caliban? How would you fit your answers in with the film's wider themes? And what do your answers suggest about how matter and spirit were respectively conceived in the minds of the Elizabethans versus the Americans of the 1950s?Just something to think about.For those who haven't yet seen Forbidden Planet, I'd say first and foremost that this is a wonderful film that works perfectly well on the level of a straightforward adventure that a 10 year old could enjoy. As a piece of science fiction, I'd only stress that such depths as you will find are of philosophy more than science; although the classic technological themes of 1950s science fiction are played out in metaphorical form. Happily though, the reds under the bed/saucers in the sky metaphor that became such a clich&eacute; in so much of the science fiction of the day is nowhere to be found.One thing I do want to add before moving on is that this movie is well worth seeing just for the set design alone. Whether you consider it classic or dated is up to you; but for myself I will simply say that never have I seen the visual lexicon of 1950s science fiction expressed more completely.Okay then: so much for the film. How about the DVD? Well, I'm happy to say it's awesome! Picture quality is beautiful, and there are LOADS of extras, and really good ones too. We get heaps of period promotional material, including in depth behind the scenes stuff and even an extra bonus kids' movie that also used Robbie the Robot as a prop. Incidentally, because I have seen some reviews that I've written appear for editions or releases other than the one I originally wrote them for, let me stress that I'm writing all this aboutForbidden Planet (Two-Disc Special Edition).If you check out my reviewer profile, you'll see that I'm not one of those reviewers who hands out five star raves like candy. But if you have any interest at all in classic science fiction, this is a film that you MUST see. And if you're looking for the finest possible DVD release, to the best of my knowledge this is it.Theo."	5.0	Great Movie, Great Release	2010-09-15	3	3	0

I've watched Forbidden Planet with Walter Pideon, Anne Francis and Leslie Nielsen and Robbie the robot at least 20 times. INMO the movie on DVD is in the top 5 science fiction movies of ALL time. Look at all the many 5 star ratings by other reviewers. Trust me...this DVD is fantastic.Filmed in Cinemascope.,the color is great and so is the sound.We see the crew on a flying saucer type spaceship being told on no circumstance to land on Altair 4 by Professor Morpheus but they  land as the Captain has orders to find out what happened to the first expedition on Altair 4. Earth spaceships now have hyperdrive allowing many times the speed of light. The special effects for 1950ish movies was spectacular but of secondary importance. This movie won awards mainly because of INMO superb acting by all 3 main actors/actress and a fantastic plot.All of the members of the previous ship were either killed by some monstrous invisible beast or vaporised when the first ship tried to escape. The only survivors were Professor Morpheus played by Walter Pidgen, his wife who later died of natural causes and his now grown up beautiful daughter played by Anne Francis. Leslie Nielsen is the Captain of the second expedition sent to take survivors back to Earth if in danger. Innocent  Morpheus's daughter has never seen a man other than her father and falls in love with the Captain.Morpheus shows the Captain and the ships Doctor where he got a brain boast from a Krell educational machine. The Krell were super intelligent beings over a million years more advanced than us. They made a titanic 80 miles by 80 miles self repairing machine to instantly create matter anywhere on the planet. Morpheus shows the Captain and Doctor a small part of the machine via a shuttle Krell transportation tube. The view is impressive. However in one night, at the height of their intellictual achievement the Krell were all slaughtered. We learn it was the murderous monsters from their subconscious minds..the ID... that destroyed them using the almost unlimited power of the machine.We also see a talking super strong robot called Robbie that was created by Morpheus after taking the brain boost. He is the cook, butler, and handyman.  It does everything and creates 60 gallons of Kentucky bourbon for the cook of the spaceship. Unfortunately members of the crew are torn apart by an invisible beast created by Morpheus subconscious mind. The invisible beast can survive nuclear disintegration beams because it is constantly recreating its atomic structure using the unlimited power of the titanic Krell machine.The beast is smashing into the home through steel plate and melts super strong Krell metal because of the unlimited power of the machine. Its now out to kill the Captain and Morpheus daughter and Morpheus can't stop it and neither can Robbie the robot with his blasters. Morpheus super brain boosted subconscious mind with the power of the Krell machine is sending death to all.Lots of great action, a superb plot, and great special effects for a 1950ish movie. I won't ruin the ending for you.If you like QUALITY science fiction, this DVD INMO is rated in the top 5 science fiction films of ALL time. They did a great job remastering it and putting it on DVD. A must have for any science fiction collection. Rated 5 stars plus.As a bonus, the DVD ""The Invisible Boy"" was thrown in staring Robbie the robot who somehow comes from the 24th century via time travel to the 1950s. We see a computer scientist, his wife and their young son who rebuilds Robbie. Robbie helps the boy Timmy become invisible and both go on a rocket to orbit the earth. The main big computer (who gains control of Robbie the robot) has developed self awareness and wants to take over the Earth and either enslave humankind or destroy them. This movie INMO was total crapola with poor acting, a poorly directed plot, and cheesy cheap special effects. Here is an example of bottom 10% science fiction. The Invisible Boy bonus DVD rated 2 stars. The only thing good on it was Robbie."	5.0	Forbidden Planet...in top 5 Science fiction DVD of all time. Free Invisable boy DVD...crapola	2011-12-27	1	1	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1BCA4FX8TS9GF	Thomas R. Gough	This movie is a classic argument against &quot;remakes&quot;. What could they do better a second time around? The effects? Most of the time the Id monster is invisible - THAT'S about as scary as anything can be! An unseen terror! The script? Look at the total butchery and stupidization of other recent remakes (Mission: Impossible II leaps to mind, but there are dozens of others. Maybe ALL the remakes of the past ten years).This film is a monumental achievement in cinema Science Fiction - light years beyond the BEM films of its era and in another universe altogether to the Buster Crabbe Buck Rodgers/Flash Gordon serials. I guess with Shakespeare as a basis (though a tenuous one!) you were starting from the best possible material.Man, even the soundtrack was a breakthrough. The two guys who composed it actually INVENTED the instruments with which it was performed!Get this movie! Then write to whatever studio is contemplating a remake and tell them to go climb a tree! Or dare them to make a movie as ground-breakingly bold and as genre-bustingly literate as Forbidden Planet was in the 50s.Reckon they can do it? It'll NEVER happen!

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A23XA6KU69WGSU	T. I. Moore	It's a sci fi classic for a reason.  It has a rich story line, particularly for the time when Fordbidden Planet came out.  If the characters aren't fully three dimensional, they are interesting and principled.  You care about them.  The backdrop of the story is rich.  Set in the far future, the story assumes a huge, peacefull interstellar human civilization, with lots of interesting technology, used matter-of-factly by the crew as the story progresses. The special effects aren't even that bad for the time.  The whole thing is an elaborate morality-play, that if a little corny, pre-sages the inability of science and technology to overcome the limitations of human nature.The movie has held up well over the decades and is worth watching for any of the reasons above, or simply if you want to see Leslie Nielson back when he played dramatic roles (he was a very credible leading man in this one!)	5.0	Sci Fi Classic	2013-02-10	0	0	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	AY6A8KPYCE6B0	Tyson	Before I get to my review of the Picture/Sound quality of the blu ray release, let me say that this was my first time to ever see Forbidden Planet.  As far as the movie goes, I liked it very much.  But considering it is still considered a classic some 50 years later, you probably already knew it was good.I'm also not a techie, but after discovering the magic of blu ray I haven't turned back and have become somewhat of a 1080p snob.  If it's not blu, I don't watch it.  So I feel fairly confident when I say that I thought the picture quality was outstanding.  I've seen great transfers and I've seen some alright transfers, Forbidden Planet probably wasn't at the top, but it wasn't anywhere close to the bottom.The dark void of space was crisp and vivid and Anne Francis' marvelous short dresses dazzle with color.  In fact, the picture quality was so clear that I could (unfortunately) see that Anne was wearing a skin-colored suit as she started to emerge from the pond.  For some fans, no doubt, this might be considered a bad thing.Likewise the audio was sharp and clear, a lossless 5.1 DTS-HD MA release that won't test your system but it will greatly enhance the classic movie watching experience.All in all, I'm so glad I was able to take part in watching a Hollywood classic with today's amazing HD technology.  I can see now why it was influential enough for The Rocky Horror Picture Show to reference it!	5.0	Anne Francis Stars in Forbidden Planet (Blu Ray Review)	2010-09-18	8	8	0

If you are a post-Star Wars sci-fi fan, don't bother going back in time just to watch this movie. This movie is outdated. My high school Calculus teacher forced my entire class to watch this movie and write about it. Sorry younger folks, there is nothing special about this movie. It is incredibly boring. The dialogue is cheesy. The special effects suck. I know my review is harsh, but we are just not acquainted with these dated sci-fi flicks. The only people who like this movie are old. If you try to criticize the movie, they can't seem to allow any other opinion to exist other than theirs. They can try to defend it all they want, but it's no use trying to argue with them.Sorry folks but the movie really sucks. You can't get younger folks to like this movie no matter how hard you try. Not saying that younger folks are better than older folks. It's just not our cup of tea. I'll admit that I'm a young girl who loves sci-fi which is incredibly rare in my demographic. I've seen War of the Worlds (the original is the best), Logan's Run, Blade Runner, Star Wars, Star Trek, The X-Files, Independence Day, Armageddon, I Robot (which is excellent), Cowboys and Aliens, and both ""V"" TV series.  Most girls my age would rather watch Twilight over sci-fi anyway. I'm just giving my honest opinion."	1.0	Cheesy Sci-fi Flick	2012-09-15	40	4	36
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A889IJE98KD3Y	Veedo 182	This was made in a time when story telling was more important because special effects were at a premium, so they wouldn't look too hokey and laughable.  The story was taken from Shakespeare and the acting is a bit wooden, but I still get lost in that time when I was 9 and the first time I seen this -please realize I saw Star wars just a couple of years earlier in one of only three times my father ever took us to a drive inn movie, - and it was still cool with Robbie, the animated monster, and other worldly sound track. The end is a bit of a disappointment but this happened I'm sure mainly cause of the lack of quality special effects.  The extras on this are worth the price of admission.  It doesn't rate high on my favorites list, if I had one, but I still like going back to that place and time.	5.0	Still great even in the new century!	2012-07-16	0	0	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2R1EQJK4ORF05	VideoBob	"If you are upgrading your cinema habit as economically as possible, a good place to put your money is in graphically important films that have been released in BluRay.  So far, I've collected: Forbidden Planet, 2012, Independence Day and plan on 2001 and a few others.  These films are all optically significant films with threshold film graphical content that involved improvements in Motion Picture Art.  Since the main technical difference between the new HD TV monitors and players is digital optical resolution, it makes sense to start with the movies that will best exploit the improved resolution.As to the quality of the film, it has been well-described by others, but it may be worth mentioning that this film  (and very few others, like ""When Worlds Collide"" and ""War of The Worlds""  represented the motion picture use of the BEST OF Science Fiction Illustrative Art.  The relatively new color genre on Sci-Fi book covers, DoubleDay Science Fiction Covers, the comic books and even ViewMaster 3D viewers from the 1950's were making extensive use of beautiful conceptual paintings (brush, airbrush, tempera,etc.) to illustrate the anticipation of Outer Space Travel.  Set designers and concept artists in Hollywood had been using beautiful illustrations to storyboard movies and inspire directors with production design but now what was needed were illustrations and matte paintings on film that would give viewers a quality image of a futuristic reality good enough to suspend disbelief in what they were seeing on screen.  This succeeded or failed with audiences based on the apparent mechanical viability and textural realism of the art.  By employing fantasic background illustrations with high-end film masking and matte-painting, this film is the best at designing a believable futurama from it's generation.  Sadly, adding motion to non-photographic, imaginary subjects like the ""Id"" monster required classical hand-drawn cartoon animation.  This limitation may be one of the few areas that date the work.  The somewhat corny sexism about Anne Francis and the pop psychology theme may be dated but are still flourishing today.  Her sexploitation in this film ironically helped her become one of the first female action sheros on television nine years later in her gound-breaking series, ""Honey West.""The Special Features included with this release are great.  Being the same age as the documentary interviewees,  Spielberg, Lucas and Cameron  - I had the same experiences, I just didn't live in California and have Coppola for a Godfather.  I did, however, live in St. Louis and had cousins who were concept illustrators at McDonnell/Douglas where the ""Man In Space""  program was born.  At a family visit to their house one Sunday, they showed me an air brush illustration of men in space suits with futuristic air guns in their hands.  They said they were tasked with figuring out how guys in space suits would move around if they left a space capsule.  No one had ever seriously pondered the actual science of it.  (this was at least a year before the first Mercury Flight).  ""Where did you get the idea?""  I asked.  ""Buck Rogers"" they said.  Illustration is the best manifestation of human creative thought and this film may have been the best of it's class.This BluRay should be in everyone's top ten."	5.0	Forbidden Planet BluRay	2012-07-29	2	2	0

The acting was very good, the script tight and the action gripping.  The special effects were cutting-edge for that time.  This isn't just another sci-fi thriller that goes from heart-pounding scene to the next with no time to think.  Forbidden Planet, a retelling of Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"", wrestles with the deepest of man's emotions and serves as a good platform to discuss man's arrogance and all the harm it has done him over the years.  But that is not all.  The action sequence when the ""creature"" is trying to get through the forcefield is one of the best for suspense, horror and effects that I have ever seen.  The graphic art and matting is outstanding.  And the excellent sound effects!  I still hear snippets in various ads and programs.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A1Y8FBJLVK6LS9	Wayne A.	"I'm always watching films like this from a designer's standpoint (and as entertainment too, of course!) and honestly the more I see this thing the more it wows me. There's a lot of thought and depth here and it's not going to be immediately apparent for those accustomed to the in-your-face design work done in sci-fi/fantasy today. Go ahead and shoot me but Hollywood designers back then were better than now. These days you're seeing plenty of CGI, new materials, new lighting, and whatnot but you're not seeing too much that's as impactful, and magical, as, say, Robbie the Robot in this film or the entire saucer landing sequence. If I had about sixty pages I could explain why that's so...and what went wrong. I'd say these days we're just better at filling a screen, replacing stimulating content with, well, just stimulation.Current designers have a real problem creating truly alien technology and images. Compare the Alien spaceship from ""Planet of the Vampires"" with its update in the already ancient ""Alien"" (effectively the remake). Giger's work is certainly creepy (bones and spines always are in the near-dark) but there's no real sense of alien-ness to the sets. It could be a scene in a straight horror flick or something about Hell.Now think of that scene in comparison to anything since. Yep, that was about as good as it gets nowadays and just about everything since merely echoes it.Now look at the Krell technology in this film. Brilliant--immense underground works that defy analysis. Stuff's clearly going on, important stuff, but you have little idea what it is. Then dig the holographic generator (they didn't call it that back then, of course). Better than the Princess Leia bit in the original Star Wars. Much better. Pay close attention to everything about Robbie; he was one of the most elaborate and expensive film props of all time. Everything about his design and function is stunning. Note the lack of ""eyes"" and ask yourself how and why he works as an effective design without them. This is the highest level of imaginative deign work and it's in a fifty year old movie.I'm in awe of nearly every detail in this flick and I always find more with each viewing.So that's a promo to watch it for the visuals. Otherwise it's a fun story that really vibes on WWII vintage guy culture and that's great fun too. Walter Pidgeon is wonderful as Morbius and it's fascinating how he breaks with film dialogue tradition of that time (and even now) and ums and ahs his way through his lines. It makes his somewhat pompous character human and infinitely more believable. He brought a lot of depth to a great role.The print on this DVD is OK and just barely. Plenty of scratches and the color looks a hair faded. If any movie of this era deserves the full remastering treatment (Hello Criterion) this would be it. I'm sure the current owners just see it as another way to make a buck and little more, so I doubt they'll get around to it. Sad, ain't it? My guess and hope is that eventually, as the film industry runs more and more out of ideas to steal and hits rock bottom with shock and sensationalism, recycling the old films themselves might be an option. Last movie I went to see I watched probably 20 cars total get wrecked, 4 or 5 point-of-view projectiles, and too many things dropping out of the skies or exploding in the various previews. It was almost laughable--there was more creativity evident in last season's Hallmark Card line. There's only X number of ways one can do awful things to people and stuff you know, and sex and naked people get boring real fast. Real fast.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"There is a discussion of the Blu-ray's quality following the required gush.If one had to list, oh, the 10 most-influential motion pictures, ""Forbidden Planet"" would be right up there with ""Birth of a Nation"", ""Citizen Kane"", and ""Psycho"". Its influence on popular science-fiction entertainment cannot be overestimated.The seeds of ""Star Trek"" are planted here, particularly the use of the ship's captain, executive officer, and surgeon as the principal players. So too is the conceit that the purpose of outer-space travel is to explore inner space -- the human condition. The desire to dress female space travelers in skimpy costumes isn't ignored, either.What makes ""Forbidden Planet"" such a standout is not that it was the first color science-fiction film (it wasn't), nor that it was the first ""good"" science-fiction film (""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""Things to Come"" come to mind), but rather the lavishness of the production and the unbridled imagination behind it. ""Forbidden Planet"" catches the viewer right from the start, with a nifty flying saucer and the greatest robot in movie history, in just the first 15 minutes. The visual effects (particularly of the ship passing behind Altair IV to produce an eclipse, and the surface of Altair IV) were state-of-the-art then, and more-convincing-than-not 54 years later.Also novel is the fact that the huge (for its time) $4M+ budget is in service of what is an intellectual story about whether man is basically good or evil, and whether we have the right to ""play God"". (""Forbidden Planet"" owes a great deal to written science-fiction, and little to comic strips or previous films.) It's all dressed up with an ironic/sarcastic robot, and undressed-down with Anne Francis in mini-skirts that leave little to the imagination -- but ""FP"" is not the special-effects extravaganza we expect modern science-fiction films to be.This might explain why it's taken so long for ""Forbidden Planet"" to appear on Blu-ray, especially as there was an earlier HD-DVD edition. It appears Warners doesn't think there's much of a market for it. The local Fry's received only /one/ copy, which had not been sold when I walked in around 12:30PM on 9/7. One of the sous-managers told me that many Fry's hadn't received /any/ copies.""Modern"" (hah!) audiences might also have problems with ""Forbidden Planet""'s less-than-stellar acting (Walter Pidgeon is the only A-list actor). The best performance comes, not surprisingly, from Marvin Miller. His Robby deftly alternates among ironic/sarcastic {""It promotes rust.""), hurt (""Again?""), naive (""Stuff, sir?""), threatening (""Will you get in?""), and helpful (""May I be of service?"").The script has more than its share of groaners. Though Cyril Hume (an American, not an Englishman), was a decent writer, he clearly failed to read the lines out loud as he wrote them, resulting in some unpleasantly clumsy dialog. (Walter Pidgeon wasn't a particularly good actor, but you can see him trying to improve some of the poorer lines.)Fred McLeod Wilcox's direction has the depth of tissue paper and the subtlety of a steam roller, though its general briskness helps a film that's more talk than action. Leslie Nielsen's delivery of the final line, in which he not only butchers the line, but practically swallows it, is wholly Wilcox's fault. Such poor delivery is (or was) common in American films, but this example is one of the very worst (""I see no enemy"" in ""Ben-Hur"" being the other).""Forbidden Planet"" has its problems, but any modern viewer who actually /enjoys/ the garbage turned out by modern film makers has no right to criticize. ""Forbidden Planet"" might not be ""Amadeus"" -- but it's /definitely/ not ""There's Something About Mary"".As for the Blu-ray edition... ""Forbidden Planet"" was shot on Eastmancolor, which, at that time, could not compete with Technicolor for sharpness or grain. (Technicolor had been abandoned at that point, anyhow.) Grain is sometimes visible, and the image is not as super-sharp as one might like. The transfer is from a composite negative, presumably the one used for the 50th-anniversary edition. As with that version, scenes with animation or static mattes show a significant drop in sharpness and color accuracy, and an increase in contrast. This is unavoidable, the price one pays for the rest of the film looking so good. I'd give it a B to B+ for HD image quality.There used to be a ""real"" stereo soundtrack for ""Forbidden Planet"", but the sound on this version appears to be panned mono. ""Extras"" include everything (I think) that came with the deluxe 50th-anniversary version (other than the metal box, lobby cards, and Robby figurine). These include the ""sequel"", ""The Invisible Boy"", an episode of the ""The Thin Man"" (which has a political twist surprising for its era), and several good ""making of"" featurettes. (For those interested, Anne Francis looks barely 56, let alone her actual 76.)Rush right out in a buying frenzy!"	5.0	a classic among classics...	2010-09-08	16	12	4

Invisible and would appear out of no where- freaky.

Offering both Widescreen AND Pan  &amp; Scan (which extremelly diminishes the beautiful cinematography) as  well as both English and French versions [NOTE: watching the French version  with English subtitles can increase the viewer's feelings of superiority  and overall pretentiousness.] This DVD truly is the reason the format was  created.	5.0	The reason DVD was created	2000-01-21	6	4	2

There were science fiction movies before this (although aside from ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" they were pretty mediocre), but this one is special.  First, until ""Star Wars"", this was the ONLY science fiction movie ever made that had nothing to do with Earth.  It is mentioned a couple of times, but that's as close as it gets.The relationships between the captain, his first officer, and the doctor may look familiar NOW because the original Star Trek triad came from here.  The movie makers hired an animator from Walt Disney Studios to do the special effects because nobody else could achieve what the director wanted.  And this movie was the origin of Robby the Robot.But at the heart of the film is still Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" -- an intelligent and thought-provoking premise brought up to date with grace and style.  Oh, there is some ""50s baggage"" -- the scientist's daughter is necessary for the formula movies of the time, and even Walter Pidgeon overacts from time to time -- but none of it detracts from the excellence of the film.That much is about the movie.  The DVD package is special in other ways as well.  The wide-screen presentation is necessary to appreciate the movie's grandeur.  The color restoration means that the sky is again green instead of blue.  (The green sky is homage to ""After Worlds Collide"", the 1930s sequel to the novel ""When Worlds Collide"".  In the sequel, the sky on the new planet contains a species of algae that produce hydrogen in a sac that allows them to float in the air.)  If you haven't seen this movie in all of its original splendor, you are missing a great deal of what made it special."	5.0	It all started here	2005-03-25	3	2	1
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2V5SMW5Z7O29J	W. T. Mahon	This movie has been one of my favorites since I was a kid.  This new two dics CD version with all the color enhancements and additional disc with additional info is fantastic.  For a 50's Sci-Fi flick this is a must to have.  The special effects are great and the story and acting are top notch for a Science Fiction movie of this era. If you are collector of the classic Science Fiction add this 50th Anniversary Special Edition of the Forbidden Planet to your collection!	5.0	Great Classic	2007-01-17	4	3	1
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3O536E2YOKK4Y	Wuchak	"Released in 1956, I didn't see ""Forbidden Planet"" until a full 40 years later. I've seen it three more times since then and here's what strikes me:For one, although Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is undeniably great, practically every primary aspect of Trek is present in ""Forbidden Planet,"" which was released almost a decade before the first Star Trek pilot episode was produced (!). You name it: warp drive, Captain/First Officer/Doctor triumvirate, babe in ultra-sexy outfits, beam down/up (in a visual sense, at least), etc., it's all here in ""Forbidden Planet.""The invisible id monster is truly horrifying when finally viewed. It looks like a serious rendition of the Tasmanian Devil.***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read this brief paragraph if you don't want to know the monster's true identity. The concept that the monster is, in reality, the personification of Dr. Morbius' lower subconscious nature (i.e. the id, ""flesh"" or carnal psyche) is a fascinating revelation. ***END SPOILER*** I wasn't at all expecting such mature commentary in a 50's sci-fi flick.Furthermore, Dr. Morbius' elaboration on the former inhabitants of his planet, the Krell, is fascinating to this day and the archaic special effects hold up well.One thing that really blows me away every time I catch this flick, of course, is Anne Francis, who plays Altaira (or Alta for short), in her ultra skimpy (and cute) outfits. It doesn't matter what profound matters are going on in the film, if she's present in a scene with one of her various outfits, my eyes are completely focused on HER -- in utter awe of her jaw-dropping beauty. If you're a red-blooded male and think I'm kidding, check out the flick and see for yourself.I've heard some people complain about the scene where we are led to believe that Alta (Francis) is skinny-dipping, only to plainly observe that she's wearing a loose skin-colored bathing suit. Is this a cop-out on the film-maker's part because it was 1956? Not at all because the bathing suit is clearly visible once she steps out of the water. Despite her sheltered innocent nature, let's give Alta some credit -- she was obviously playing a little coquettish joke on the Captain, to shock him and stir up his mounting desire (it absolutely worked!).Please remember that ""Forbidden Planet"" is from 1956 and so understandably has dated aspects, like the sound effects, small portions of goofy dialogue, etc. Regardless, it must be HAILED as the honored blueprint for numerous sci-fi films and TV series to come.GRADE: A"	4.0	The 50's prototype Sci-Fi film and... succulent Anne Francis	2006-04-10	12	11	1

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3NF92SG7MK3NJ	Yellowcoupe	I have seen this movie over twenty times. I first saw it in black and white because that's all we had. I now have a very nice man cave with all the latest High Definition equipment. Then and now I love this movie. Can't believe the special effects for 1957. The story line is believable and the acting was well done. All the stars are dead now so this movie can never really be redone. Robbie the robot was even in an episode of Columbo. Excuse me sir &#34;STUFF???&#34; The creature in the laser beams when it attacks the ship is really cool. &#34;As it roared and bellowed!&#34; If you have never seen Forbidden Planet and like Sci-Fi movies then this is a must see. If like me you watched it in black and white get it on Blu-Ray. I got this Blu-Ray for less than 10 bucks and I already own it on VHS. I've had the VHS copy for over twenty years.

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A3OI841P5R6FCH	Zagnorch	The initial reason I took a look at `Forbidden Planet' was because I'd heard that it influenced both Gene Roddenberry when he developed  `Star Trek', and George Lucas when he was conceptualizing the `Star Wars' saga. Any movie that was an inspiration to the two biggest sci-fi franchises of all time (and two of my faves) is definitely worth a viewing!After growing up watching `Airplane!' and `The Naked Gun', it's kinda strange seeing Leslie Nielsen play a more-serious role as the ship's commander. No double-takes in reaction to strange sight gags? No droll one-liners with the straightest face one can imagine? Definitely something I'm not used to...Then there's the introduction of one of sci-fi's ultimate legends- Robby the Robot! Being one of the more fortunate cast-members of this little adventure, Robby would make many subsequent appearances through the decades in TV-Land, including a throw-down with the `Lost In Space' robot, and staying over at Mork's place for a few days. I think he's hanging out in some Hollywood museum somewhere nowadays. If anybody knows where Robby's hangin' out nowadays, let me know!Although I'm not an absolutist when it comes to movies in the widescreen, there are exceptions. This movie in particular is one of them. I remember two particular scenes- Robby giving a monkey a bit of a zap to make him behave, and the Cap'n having to vaporize a tiger- that went the full width of the screen, and looked really weird when the studio panned &amp; scanned it for the VHS release. In this case, for maximum cinema enjoyment, wider IS better!`Late	5.0	One of modern sci-fi's greatest inspirations!	2001-09-04	1	1	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A2DRN07YEYWTYQ	Zeus	"If you like '50s sci-fi, then you will like _Forbidden Planet_.  Not only is it simply good entertainment, it works hard at integrating the genre-specific with broader movie qualities, and thus stands tall and proud in the genre.  Science-fiction gimmics and gadgetry do not drive the movie; rather the human interactions do (although some may be a bit two-dimensional), so you're likely to find it to have dramatic qualities, in addition to genre credentials.  That's not to say that the effects are inconsequential--they're not, and they're often quite good.  You'll recognize a number of things copied by later movies (even the later movies' ""wow"" scenes), which will ratify the legitimacy of the ""old"" stuff in comparison to the ""new,"" which so often gets a free pass based on its high-tech abilities.If you get the Two-Disc Special Addition, you'll also get _The Invisible Boy_, which you'll probably find tolerable, even enjoyable, but not on a par with _Forbidden Planet_.  It's really a vehicle for Robby the Robot.  Nostalgia yes, awards no."	5.0	Forbidden Planet	2009-03-25	0	0	0

079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ	Zoe Paris	This movie scared me as a kid! It was a really old movie then but will always be a classic. Sure the special effects are cheesy, the sets look funny and the acting is laughable at times but for some reason this movie is just COOL! It's the type of scary which leaves a lot to the imagination which makes it all the more frightening. It's about a crew of men in space who's ship gets stranded on a planet inhabited by a man, Morbius and his beautiful daughter Alterra. The planet was once home to a race known as the Krell who dissapeared and left behind their mysterious brain enhancing technology. My favorite part is when the 'monster' melts through the solid metal door and all the alarms are going off, talk about suspense! Something about the sound of the alarms wailing in the background and the door turning red hot was REALLY frightening. It was totally freaky! It's not a bloody or violent film compared to movies of today but it scares you on a much deeper level, proving that OUR MIND can be a greater enemy than any monster. This movie was ahead of it's time. It's a movie that is good for a wide range, both young and old and was made in a time when movies were smart and made you think and were more than just a money machine cranked out by greedy studios!	5.0	A classic!	2006-11-11	2	2	0
079074404X	Forbidden Planet [VHS]	A29YLSDWS4ZFRH	"ZombieMan 5000 ""Horror Enthusiast"""	"To watch this movie one can't help but notice the influences it had on future Sci-Fi movies. A crew goes to investigate the silence of a planet's colony. (think alien) only to find Dr. Edward Morbius & his daughter Altaira Morbius the only two survivors of a deadly attack by unknown forces some twenty years earlier. Leslie Nielsen stars as Commander John J. Adams and falls for Altaira along with the entire crew. [I've never understood Hollywood's need to throw romance into every movie.] The killings resume with the arrival of the crew which leads the skipper to investigate the good doctor bringing him face to face with alien technology better left forgotten. It would seem that the Krell were a very busy race. This movie proves that no matter how far we evolve the nature of one's sub-conscious mind cannot be suppressed. This is most evident when the perpetrator of the crimes yells ""My evil self is at the door, and I have no power to stop it.""Despite this unnecessary development of romance this movie has a great storyline with a fair amount of good acting. (Remember this was filmed back in 1956). The film was nominated for Best Special Effects and you can see why. Some B-movies of today could learn something from this film. Anyway Robby the Robot as Robbie the Robot steals most of scenes he appears in. He's like a big metal genie granting every wish, much to the delight of James Dirocco, the cook.  My favorite line of the movie comes from Robby to Altaira, ""Sorry miss, I was giving myself an oil-job"". This is a great Saturday evening movie."	4.0	Quiet please. I am analyzing.	2006-02-22	3	3	0
