B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2XGBG4JH47FPG		Not a true retelling of Thermopylae but a fantastic movie just the same and an excellent adaptation of Miller's graphic Novel. The choreography of the fight scenes is some of the best I have ever seen. Couple this with some well done special effects, and a good old fashion good guy bad guy plot line and this is a definite must own.	5.0	Not a true retelling of Thermopylae, but still pretty sweet	2007-08-02	6	6	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AR5YYDGY61TMO	"240C ""GateCrasher"""	"I am not writing this to argue how great this movie was or any of that madness. Personally, I loved it. I have to admit it was to much CGI but other than that, it was pretty entertaining. I did not expect an Acadamy award winner like everyone else. Nor was I expecting something true to history. I mean common, it was based on a comic book people! I laugh at the reviews saying it was not true to history and that it was a Gladiator rip off. Well to tell you the truth, at the end of 300 when he was in the wheat fields with his family, same thing happened in Gladiator. I went to see this movie with a group of men simply just to see some action/killing. Common admit it, some of you all did too. Sure sometimes the movie got repetitive, I will admit that. The movie is not perfect, and a lot of idiots out there are blasting it because its ""supposed"" to be perfect. I purchased a copy when it came out and I have yet to watch it again. Why is that? Because I am to busy re watching Casino and Goodfellas. And for Gladiator, I watch that once every two days. There are plenty of better movies out there that will keep you interested. But when that primal instinct for action comes over you, just watch key scenes from 300 and you will be okay. So if this review did not help, its not going to hurt my feelings at all. Just wanted to talk to my fellow movie buffs that all."	5.0	Not trying to sway anyones opinion!!!	2007-09-19	1	0	1
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1956Z7NWJ4FO3	29GRITS	"OK....I admit it - I only went to see ""300"" w/ my husband to be a good sport.  [He and our sons are fans/critics of graphic novels, comic book officianados/collectors/commentators who had anxiously awaited the film's release; I am ""just"" an English/literature educator w/ a love of history and good artistic interpretation of both.]  HOWEVER, I was absolutely stunned by this movie.It is captivating, artistic, motivational, and NEVER dull.  Of course, Gerard Butler and his army are easy-on-the-eye, but the sheer choreography of this movie throughout makes it worth viewing multiple times.  Myriad artistic elements - sensual as well as visual - mesmerize the viewer; many ""stand up and cheer"" moments prevail - not only during battle, but for the people: brave - STRONG - women (""we bear Spartan warriors"") undaunted by formidable foes or standing up for their convictions; men who do not shirk insurmountable odds, death, or facing its prospect; children taught to believe in what their culture holds dear, true, and of moral value.  I anticipated the blood baths, but was not put off by them because of the digitalization; the ""slo-mo"" sequences, with the graphic novel effects, especially complemented the film's genre and delivery; the comic effects were adequate exaggerations without being ""comedic"" in any way. The whole presentation was a work of art, w/ a masterfully rendered musical score contributing even more to the emotion of each scene - right up to the end...how could you not leave feeling a chord deep inside your soul had been struck?  The portrayal of dignity and peace, even in death, was phenomenal.While I do know enough of ancient history to understand there were deviations from the truth, it was opportune that the History Channel chose to air the ""real"" accounting of events of Thermopylae/the 300 several times during the premiere week, so it was an excellent way to set the record straight in my mind.  Nonetheless, I feel the movie's portrayal of these ancient warriors and this particular battle does nothing to diminish the idea that they were noble beyond compare.All that to say that I will purchase the special edition when it's released - for ME...and maybe I'll share it with my husband! :-)"	5.0	Unexpected Pleasure	2007-07-24	19	16	3

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	'300' is a bloody epic that combines the best of the old and new.  Sporting sweeping cinematography that is partly colorized and partly bleached, the film has the effect of being a glorified version of an older film.  Featuring relentless battle scenes that resemble a slow motion version of a graphic video game, '300' leaves nothing to the battle imagination.  Sensuality from barebreasted women to men is sweeping red capes and loinclothes is up front to mix with the bloodbath of killer war scenes that artfully show hand-to-hand and full-scope visions of battles.The story as many have heard is about the Spartan battle against the Persians in Thermopylae.  Presented as a defensive measure against demi-God, King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), ancient warfare presents another deterrent in favor of peace before the advent of Alfred Noble's attempt to make war obsolete by inventing dynamite.  Indeed, some of the best moments are when the war heroes or the narrator waxes poetic, and we get a badly needed break from the bloodbath.  Sometimes the story is narrated; at others it is pronounced with great stature by King hero, Leonidas (Shakespearean actor Gerard Butler).  Either way, whenever the story overrides it wins.  The political developments help to deepen the story and keep us from a continual overdrive.  His Queen wife, Gorgo (Lena Headey), frames the man and his mission and complements the movie as well.  Furthermore, the elements of ancient religion give the movie as much dimension as the nearly 3-D blood spurs that emanate at 'Matrix'-like angles.Thoroughly innovative, but at times overdone, '300' is a force to be reckoned with.	4.0	Bloody Epic	2007-04-24	0	0	0

It is pure trash for the mind and the soul as well as an insult to everyone that lived during that historic battle. Those were real human beings who deserve to be represented with some degree of fidelity. 300 is an advanced ""Triumph of the Will"" with special effects to dazzle the audience into a frenzy of hatred. I think that if any ethnic group in the United States were misrepresented as the Persians are in this movie it would be grounds for defamation if not labeled a hate crime.

It's one of the coolest movies of the past few years.  Even if you don't like the plot, you'll enjoy the slick effects (CG done right for a change) and wicked action.  It's gory, so send the kids to bed early.  If you own a Blu-ray player, this is why you bought it.In response to previous reviews, I saw no flickering or other problems.  I thought the image and sound quality were excellent. The only complaint I can really give about the overall product is the bare-bones feel of the case.  I'm used to getting a nicely polished package (double-printed label with an image on the inside of the case) and some sort of insert/chapter list.  None of that on this one.  It feels thrown together. It's nit-picky, but I appreciate the little things like that. The Blu-Ray disc itself is excellent.  The bonus features are fine.	5.0	No problems	2007-08-09	3	2	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A17Y94ZI583PRJ	Aerojunki	I thought this movie aesthetically amazing. Being a classicist, you have to try to overlook the historical inaccuracies in films like this (I was ranting and raving upon leaving the theater after seeing Troy). At first I was skeptical when the commercials starting airing on TV, but the more they aired the more the film intrigued me. The plot and dialogue was enough to hold my interest, but I'm a sucker for action sequences. Again, I thought this movie was great. To me, it combined the aesthetics of Passion of the Christ with Gladiator and even a smattering of the Lord of the Rings.	5.0	I loved this movie!	2007-07-04	4	3	1
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AX60IF80MKKNE	A. Fuller	I saw this film at a studio screening in Los Angeles. Tyler Bates constructed a soundtrack that is as amazing and striking as the rest of the film.Generally, I fall asleep in a movie theatre unless the imagery is overwhelmingly spectacular. I was awake through the entire length - even the credits - of this film. 300 is the most amazing combination of violent destruction and graceful elegance I believe I have ever witnessed on the big screen.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A23V875B0Q9HT7	Agustin Guerrero	As a film in the purely entertaining role I think it deserves a 5 star rating, it is riveting, very well crafted and a very good adaptation of Miller's graphic novel.  But then and not trying to be pedantic I will say some details ruin the whole effect of the movie.  First the phalanx did not open to allow warriors to fight alone, the strength of this battle formation relies in its unity and they always fought in close formation, if the spartans fought as depicted in the movie they would have gotten killed in the first encounter.  I know it is an allegory but details go over the top, why depict monsters such as Ephialtes, the persian king executioners and even the inmortals when it is not needed, the sheer number of persians was enough to overwhelm any enemy why put some silly characters as it does not detract or add from the action but anyway it makes the movie silly.  The inmortals were bodyguards of the Persian King recruited from the best persian nobility and trained to fight as a greek phalanx, they were called as such because they were always 5000 men and when some of them died they were inmediately replaced and of course their numbers never shrunk thus were inmortals, but otherwise they were no monsters and did not fight in Ninja garb and with japanese swords as depicted in the movie.  Even though no live historian was actually there at the battle and can attest it I believe that is very unlikely that the Persians used elephants or rhinos in fighting the Thermopylae battle, why put these scenes there at all?.  About the spartans, they were never a democracy and did not defend any democratic ideals, the Athenians had a democracy in place but the Spartans were ruled by kings, a very selective aristocracy of warriors who practiced eugenics thus getting rid of lame or weak infants, and also held in slavery millions of helots which were not depicted in the movie.  The Spartan society was a military camp that produced very fine warriors and in some aspects was used as a model for youth training by some very totalitarian societies such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.  The first 10 minutes of the movie were the best as the Agoge or process of training of young spartan warriors was very well explained although with its cinematic exaggerations.  Then the weapons used by the spartans were all wrong, first  the spartans at that time used full panoply which means they wore cuirass, helmet, graeves and hoplite shield which was made of wood covered with bronze not as a full metal shield depicted in the movie which would be heavy and un-wieldly, then spartans relied in a heavier spear as the one shown in the movie as a main weapon usually killing the enemy with a the spear [...] as they passed over them in formation than stabbing the enemy, the battle was more a pushing and shoving contest and when you fell you were either trampled to death or dispatched by a noncombatant with a knife as you lay helpless on the ground, not as depicted in the movie as a swordplay. Anyway the spartans use scimitars in this movie which is all wrong, as spartans usually had a stabbing short sword called a xyphos that was needed to  fight at very closed quarters when you don't have room to maneuver a sable or longer sword, so the head chopping and arm cutting scenes were probably wrong.  The Persians were an aryan people whose resemblance would be more near to present day armenians, circasians than dark arabic or african types as depicted in the movie, I believe also King Xerxes was badly represented specially in the robes in which he is shown that resemble more an African warlord look than a Sixth century BC Persian noble.  So because of all the annoying details that were so unnecesary and because a superproduction with so much care in the technical aspects could take a little better care of the historic details without making it aboring movie I will have to substract 2 stars and give it a 3 -star rating.	3.0	Its in the Details	2007-06-02	12	5	7

Now, that's exactly what it is: a movie based on a graphic novel which is based on actual historical events. It's meant to be graphic, surreal, and over the top. Anyone who is a fan of Miller's work will thoroughly enjoy this. If you are looking for historical accuracy then you will be disappointed. This is meant to be an epic story with great drama and fantastic acts of bravery. The acting, settings, special effects, costumes, props, and dialog are all amazing. This is my pick for best movie of 2007.

I'll keep this review short and to the point - If you're a young to middle age adult male fascinated by the idea of a graphic novel-historical adaption blend filled with violence and sexuality, look no further.  If, however, you aren't comfortable with gore and your own sexuality, perhaps it's not the right choice.The negative reviews are likely written by those who the film is not targeted to.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3AV9MQ8SUE6PF	"a.k.a. ""Lost Inner Space"""	"This is a great movie. It does not pretend to be History. It is more about the character of oral historical tradition than it is about the written word. The extras are very good. They shed light on the process of interpretation that is often, if not always, subjective story-telling. In one extra F. Miller says that what he is doing is an evocation of History and not a strict retelling. He will never be accused of Realism, he says.Ancient myths are said to be real historical events that have become distorted with each retelling. Herodotus himself did not see first-hand what he wrote about. 300 is as much about the telling of the tale as it is about the tale told. It is the Battle of Thermopylae as told by the Spartans themselves.There are some lines of dialogue that come off as veiled pro-war propaganda and other lines that portray the hubris and hypocrisy that so often colors oral histories, but overall it is true to Frank Miller's comicbook series. Some scenes are direct translations of his bold graphic style. It is a state of the art update on an old Hollywood standard- the sword and sandal epic. Except that all sets are CGI, and that is where the movie excels. It is like watching classical sculpture come alive.It is gothic for two reasons. The predominant use of the color black, and in the methods used by the Spartans to battle their enemy. At the beginning of the movie there is some use of the battle phalanx that historically defined the Spartan method of War. This correct reference is soon abandoned in favor of a Berserker type method of combat. The style of fighting progresses from the classical to the  kind of fighting practiced by Germanic tribes of Gothic warriors, the ones who overran and later assimilated into the Roman Empire.None of this spoiled the movie for me. It is quite curious, though, that this movie gets the greenlight at a time when the US is at war with Iraq. Historically, the US can be seen as inheritors of the Greek systems of government and Iraq is geographically located at the central point of what was the Persian Empire. Also curious is the tendency for those in the movie-making industry to use actors with Scottish accents battling actors with British accents whenever they portray the struggle between ""establishment"" and ""revolutionary"" elements. It is all quite curious, but Great Entertainment."	4.0	Gothic Sword and Sandal CGI on Steroids	2007-08-12	4	3	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3GI6DS6I474K8	"Alan Draven ""Dark Fiction Author"""	300 is the film adaptation of the graphic novel by Frank Miller and is partly based on the true story of 300 Spartans led by their king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) who set out to hold off an invading Persian army easily 100 times their size.This film is nothing short of spectacular!! The first must-see film of 2007. If you're familiar with Miller's graphic novel, you'll see that director Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead remake and who's slated to direct an adaptation of Alan Moore's Watchmen) rendered it very faithfully, similar to the way Robert Rodriguez did for Miller's Sin City, often adapting panel per panel on screen. I'd even go so far to say that this is the best gladiator film I've ever seen.Leonidas's character is one that I would follow to the ends of the earth; Butler was perfectly cast in the role as the kind king to his people but ruthless against his enemy. The cool visuals, the Spartans' unstoppable onslaught against the Persians, the booming score; this film is just awesome. See it on the big screen while you can, you won't be disappointed! Can't wait for a DVD release...	5.0	"""Tonight, we dine in hell!"""	2007-03-12	22	16	6
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AF5Z0RD2JCDEE	Alan	First of all, let me state that I am not one of those who dislike and dismiss this film because it is based on a comic (or graphic novel, if you insist on the term). I love comics - I just don't like the one this is based on, and it doesn't work any better as a film.Has anyone involved in this film (or the Clash of the Titans remake, or Immortals) ever been to Greece? The persistent gloom we see here is unrealistic. It might work if it was used for contrast, but no, it's there from the beginning. I think this reflects the idea that dark somehow equals serious and adult, so that for example Superman is given a brown and dark blue costume rather than one in the bright primary colours which suit him best, and insecure adults who worry about such things can be assured that although what they're watching is a fantasy, and/or based on a comic or children's book, it's worthy of their attention. (Snyder also has a curious penchant for setting things on the edges of cliffs. Maybe it's some kind of symbolism, but in Immortals he puts an entire town near a cliff's edge, which just strikes one as impractical, especially when there are young children running about.)If I criticise this film for lack of historical accuracy, some will no doubt say, come on, it's a fantasy, don't take it so seriously. But these inaccuracies are mostly connected with the political and social attitudes running through this film. Firstly, homophobia. Leonidas dismisses the Athenians as 'boy-lovers'. Miller at least must surely be aware that homosexuality was every bit as widespread and socially acceptable in Sparta as it was in Athens, and as for the implication that being gay makes one less of a man and therefore less of a soldier, one only has to look at the Theban Sacred Band. This was a troop of soldiers entirely composed of gay men, and for a time they were the most feared army in Greece. This homophobia slops over into the xenophobia, Xerxes is presented as effeminate. Now it is true that the Persians also countenanced homosexuality, but pictures and descriptions of the Persian emperor show that he looked and dressed nothing like this. For one thing, he had a long beard, a standard aspect of Persian men of power. We are being sold a view of the East, that region from whence all those nasty Islamicists and terrorists come from, as the land of  tyranny, oppression and effeminacy. To question the validity of this is not to suggest that none of these things exist in those countries, but to say that they are not inherently characteristic of all who live in them. I find it particularly ironic when Xerxes tells Leonidas that Greece can join his empire and adopt its ways or be destroyed. Isn't that, in effect, what the US has been saying to its enemies in the Mid-East for some time now?There are numerous other minor inaccuracies and absurdities. The Greek sentence rendered, 'Tonight we dine in Hell' is better translated as the more gentle,'Tonight we dine in the underworld' an expression of the Spartans' acceptance of their inevitable deaths, rather than a piece of verbal badassery. Is the traitor really so stupid as to carry the Persian money around with him? He can't spend it in Sparta, so the only function it can possibly have is to reveal his treachery. It by no means diminishes the heroism of the Spartans to point out that there were no less than 7000 other warriors present at the battle, from many parts of Greece.The sequence at the beginning of the film, in which a young Leonidas kills a huge wolf by tricking it into a narrow space, is a terrific piece of filmmaking, summing up and foreshadowing the conflict to come. As far as I'm concerned, you needn't watch the rest - it's downhill.	1.0	A piece of propaganda	2014-05-09	9	6	3

Well, I don't think it was meant to be a documentary.  I think the movie was meant to be told as heroic folklore, a legend, or tall tale.  Everything was exaggerated on purpose! i.e. Chiseled to perfection warriors who embark on a journey with nothing more than their shields and spears, foes who were giant and never ending and an enemy leader who was quite exocentric to say the least.

It was a seminal battle, the result of which determined much of what the world today looks like. 300 is the comic-book version of the story, where the Spartan are all He-Man-like heroes, the Persians represent everything debauched and capricious and the Spartan ideal of Tirtaeus, &#34;beautiful indeed is dying in the first rank&#34; permeates the entire movie.

Sure the Spartans wouldn't have gone into battle with what amounts to leather undies, but the point shown was that they were prime fighting machines who were so good at what they did they ""could"" have gone in in what amount to leather undies. And face it, it was eye candy for the ladies to watch men run around half naked for a change.The battle scenes were fun, fun, fun. Even if they did OD on the monsters a bit, as my boyfriend said. The colouring of this movie served to enhance it just that much more. The special effects were good and so was the ending, even if you knew what was going to happen.

Retelling the ancient Battle of Thermopylae, it depicts the titanic clash in which King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and 300 Spartans fought to the death against Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his massive Persian army. Experience history at swordpoint. And moviemaking with a cutting edge.i have to say that this movie was not totally a bad movie i really did enjoy the movie i felt that the story didnt make a lot of sense because i didnt understand what king leonidas point of going to war because he was so into hearing his own yelling voice or just wanted to defend his people. i mean it can be debated but for the most part...the film does have it entertaining moments in the movie i love the gore scenes that really get into the movie. frank miller is very good at creating stories full of blood and gore and violence. i thought that this movie is good but i hope that there are no more sequels to this film just 300 was enough and i think that if they make 400 or 500 then it is going to be stupid so i say buy this film and enjoy the comic book like animation and intense gore scenes even the performance of Gerard Butler is amazing to watch but if u are looking for amazing story u are not going to find it here so wait till the movie gets a little cheaper and then buy on here.	3.0	300 is best in gore but not in story	2007-10-26	1	0	1

What happened to the magic of movies?  Don't we immerse ourselves in movies to be entertained?  While 300 is by no means a historical account of the epic battle of Persians v Greeks, it is great fun!  It is without a doubt the most violent (yet oddly the most beautiful) movie I have ever seen.

For theatrical effect, the picture has the appearance of having been filmed through very slightly frosted glass. This technique, whatever, causes the background to appear as if there is considerable noise in the signal (not ""snow"", but not a steady background). Very strange. The features on the DVD are filmed normally, and look terrific...On to the story. This is a film adaptation of a COMIC BOOK. The gratuitous nudity, and splattering blood ad nauseum are completely expected once you know the original medium.

Considering you can purchase an hd-dvd player for 1/2 the cost of a blu-ray player, I don't see why they don't purchase both.With 300 on hd-dvd, you get better audio (a lot of blu-ray players can't decode Dolby TrueHD) and interactivity features the none of the blu-ray players can do. Also since the picture will be the same (I've read they used the same video encode for both), there really isn't any reason to buy this on blu-ray. If you do, your just telling the studios and blu-ray manufacturers that it's o.k. to sell you incomplete hardware and software.Combo discs mean you can play the disc in any player in your house. Unless you want to either replace all your dvd players with a PS3 ($500-$600 per unit) or purchase every movie twice (one blu-ray, one dvd), combo discs are the way to go.As for quality, every movie released on both formats have been virtually identical in reviews. Mostly the difference is noted when the blu-ray gets stuck with Dolby Digital because some of the players can't support the advanced audio. Studios release to the lowest common denominator, which is pretty low in blu-ray's case.I take anything Sony(betamax) or PS3 users say with a grain of salt. There are many reasons why HD-DVD is a smarter purchase.1. Players are significantly cheaper. Blu-ray players are hundres more expensive.2. All hd-dvd players support available features. All current blu-ray players have drawbacks of some kind. Examples: can't play cd's. can't decode advanced audio codecs, can't play picture in picture, can't access internet, the list goes on. Blu-ray players have been out for over a year and still haven't caught up with hd-dvd's features.3. Quality - I have the 1st gen HD-A1 (hd-dvd) unit and a 2nd gen BD-P1200 (blu-ray) and I've had vastly fewer problems with HD-DVD. Other than booting slower than my blu-ray player, the menu's are faster, remote is faster, I can fast forward and rewind without locking up the player, ect.Don't settle for BLU-RAY, demand the complete HD-DVD experience.	5.0	Don't listen to the Ignorant blu-ray reviewers.	2007-07-24	28	22	6
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AK0CENM3LUM28	Amazon Customer	"300 / B000Q6GX5Y*Spoilers*As a spectacle fighting movie, ""300"" is a joy to behold. The fighting sequences are beautifully choreographed, and the camera work is superb. Special effects merge flawlessly with the rest of the action, and it is a delight to see what a big budget and talented cast can produce when they put their minds to it. Even the soundtrack and soothing narrative overlay are gorgeous, combining to make the frequent and varied battle scenes a feast for the eyes and ears. And the stunning visual effects aren't limited to the battleground; the much-hyped Oracle scene is as lovely in film as it was on the promotional posters, and the visions of Xerxes and his entourage are lovely, if historically unrealistic (more on that later). Even the writing for the Spartan warriors is nicely done; the humorous quips on the battlefield are clever and help to relieve the overall tension.This isn't to say ""300"" is for everyone - if visual effects aren't your thing and spectacle fighting doesn't interest you, this movie likely won't hold your interest. There is a story, but it's definitely the weakest point of ""300"" - the jingoistic, oh-aren't-I-a-clever-writer dialogue for the Spartan queen in particular will grate on anyone's nerves, with flat lines like ""Freedom isn't free"" spoken with such overdone fervor and determination that it feels she's stepped directly out ofTeam America.And it's important to note that ""300"" isn't even remotely historically accurate - not that it needs to be, but sometimes the movie seems to think that we should think that, which is just odd. Spartans shouldn't be talking about ""freedom"" and ""free men"" as if they were present-day Americans; Sparta was a slave-holding society without shame, so why this unnecessary ""freedom"" subtext? Can't we just have a nice spectacle fighting movie about defending one's borders from an invading power without needing to make the whole thing 'relevant' to modern day events? It almost feels like the movie is embarrassed of itself and wants to tag on a ""deep"" subtext as an excuse for all this artistic fighting, but the ""deep"" material just distracts, unlike the subtext inGladiatorwhich I felt served an actual point.As a final note, having owned both the Blu-ray and the regular version of this movie, I don't particularly feel that the Blu-ray version is worth shelling out the extra money. The transfer isn't the best (there are many scenes that are still very grainy), and this isn't really the best movie to showcase Blu-ray abilities anyway, since the visual effects are deliberately kind of washed and grainy to begin with. I'd definitely recommend buying this movie, as it's definitely worthy of a spot on the shelf, but I'd buy the regular DVD over the Blu-ray version.~ Ana Mardoll"	4.0	Fun Action, Irritating Subtext, Blu-Ray transfer could be better	2009-10-19	3	2	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1B2ULYUU4YEZ1	Amazon Customer	"...and I'm especially looking at you, movie critics. While ""300"" wasn't completely accurate in terms of military history, the spirit of the Spartans, their culture, and the essence of this battle were 100% accurate. Herodotus and other contemporary Greek historians took the point of Thermopylae and its significance immediately at the time of the battle: Thermopylae was the first place in history where men died for freedom. More, they CHOSE to die for freedom and understood exactly what their sacrifice meant.Because director Zack Snyder stayed true to Frank Miller's graphic novel, all of Miller's research into the historical battle appeared in the movie. At the Persians' demand for earth and water, which were tokens of submission to the Persian empire, the Athenians killed the messengers. The Spartans threw the messengers down the well and told them, ""dig it out for yourselves.""The lines critics derided as over-the-top or too jingoistic are lines recorded by Herodotus in his histories. When the Persians told the Spartans to lay down your weapons, the Spartans shouted back, ""Come and take them!"" The caustic response to the Persians' threat that their arrows would blot out the sun was indeed, ""Good, then we shall fight in the shade."" That's black humor that is part of the military ethos to this day.While not elucidated in the movie--and this could be termed a failing, though I don't think it was a particularly crucial point--the reason the Spartans fought at Thermopylae was to hold back the Persian advance until other Greek city-states had time to rally their forces. 300 Spartans, aided by 700 Thespians and 900 helots (serfs of Sparta) held back the Persians for three days. When their spears broke, they used their swords. When their swords broke, they used their nails and teeth. The tenacity, ferocity, and courage of the Spartans is why we still know their names today; their sacrifice is the reason the western world exists. If the Spartans had failed at Thermopylae, the Greek ideas of democracy, freedom, and republicanism (primitive though they were) would have died in the cradle. Because of the Spartans, those ideas passed to Rome, and then to Europe. We are the inheritors of the Spartan's sacrifice.That so many critics and moviegoers could so badly misconstrue the meaning of this movie, ignore the courage of the Spartans and the historical significance of this battle speaks to the state of western education systems and exactly how badly devalued freedom and courage are in our modern world. To deride the Spartan's warrior culture as ""Nazi-ish"" and their bon mots as jingoistic is to be utterly ignorant of the fact that they REALLY SAID THOSE THINGS. They meant them. They're not propaganda courtesy of a modern Goebbels, as one critic said, and the people that loved the movie weren't ""seig-heiling"" outside the theater, as another criminally ignorant critic said.If you want to see the Spartans of today, look at the US Marine Corps. I was fortunate enough to see this movie in the theater, a screening for Marines who were going to deploy the next day. The black humor, defiance in the face of death, spirit of self-sacrifice, and gut understanding that freedom IS purchased with blood, as Queen Gorga noted in the movie, is all part of our modern military, and thank God it is. Without modern-day Spartans, the critics who make so free with their ignorance would never have the freedom to spout it. If you left the theater or walked away from your DVD player thinking this was just a blood-spattered action flick, you missed the point entirely.The movie itself is beautiful, hyper-real, and while Gerard Butler's Scottish accent escaped on occasion, the acting was for the most part flawless. For those complaining that the film was ""gay""....you DO know that Greeks fought in the nude, don't you? That the heroic nude is a cornerstone of the art world? And the same visual hyper-reality that was used for sets and battle-scenes applied to the bodies of the actors themselves. The actors are no less works of art than the slow motion battle scenes. The body of a warrior, the motion of battle, has been captured in artwork more frequently than almost any other subject matter. Zack Snyder was following in a tradition that began even before Classical Greece.The visual hyper-reality of the film applied to dialogue and plot: Frank Miller wasn't attempting to recreate the battle of Thermopylae as a documentary. The plot is simple because the idea at the heart of it is simple. Freedom isn't free. Expanding on the political situation or battle strategizing would've overshadowed that beautifully simple idea. The history channel had any number of documentaries about Sparta and Thermopylae at the time 300 was in theaters; watch those if you want a detailed sketch of how opposition to the Persians originally gathered around Athens and Sparta, and that a congress met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC to form a confederate alliance of Greek city-states.Historical movies don't have to be documentaries, and the success of 300 is proof of that idea. The great concepts don't have to be diluted in melodrama and politically correct casting choices. Maybe the movie critics would have preferred a story where Queen Gorga went out to fight with the Spartans and outshone her husband; never mind historical accuracy, it would've been more politically correct. Perhaps it would've been better if Zack Snyder explained that Xerxes' father called him names when he was a child, so we could sympathize with the Persians' attempt to invade and conquer Greece. Maybe Leonidas should've had a gay lover to flesh out his character.Maybe the critics should learn their history before they try to critique another movie."	5.0	It's amazing how many people missed the point...	2007-08-07	7	6	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AK3DTNDKJ9N0I	"Amazon Customer ""KingNot"""	"If I could re-write the graphic novel it is based on I'd have the epilogue being the tale told by beings in a far future earth preparing for a desperate last battle, perhaps protecting a giant space ark from Abhumans just long enough so it can launch, sacrificing themselves in the process.The movie was incredible, but short of perfection by the inclusion of modern ""Right Wing"" bias to it.  And I've seen this seized on by mentally defective persons who buy the ""Right Wing"" line of Rich Elite worship and hate speech masked as patriotism.And the real irony is, without this movie if anything about Spartan culture had been proposed they'd have called the person a Communist, a Nazi (social Darwinism), a homosexual and a NAMBLA member.  That same ""Lykurgos"" the Law-Giver did cool things like banning money.  That traitor ambassador wouldn't have had anything to spend his ill gotten shekels on.  To be precise, money wasn't banned, but it had to be in large iron disks, coins were forbidden as was gold, decorating a mantle in gold or silver or jewels, displays of wealth...  The long and short, yes you could make rare big purchases, like a new ox to plow your fields, but there was no 'coin' to casually spend on frivolity.  And without that, there were no people coming to supply that market, no sellers of wares, no whore mongers, no usurers...  In short, Lykurgos was an early Communist.  He 're-distributed' the land, btw...And the Spartans were mercenaries, but at least they were defending their own land in that battle.  They went on foreign wars all the time, BUT they chose their battles VERY carefully, and this choice was ""how does this benefit us?""  If King Leonidas could talk to today's impoverished troops, he'd doubtless tell them to mutiny and set up their own little mini-kingdom in Iraq, and use that position to profit off oil sales.The story itself is a bit different from History.  In RL the traitor was a farmer who was unhappy with his lot in society, since the warrior class were tops and had fun beating everyone but their women when they weren't at war to keep them afraid of them.  And the oracle said in RL that Sparta would fall but that future could be averted if the king gave his life.  Yes, this is real.Other bits of artistic license are cool, though.  The RL battle would have been boring to today's audience, mainly because it'd be hard to watch.  They didn't randomly break their Phalanx to do acrobatics, they'd have been wiped out in seconds.  The Persians had another traitor, an exile from Sparta who gave the king warning;  ""No Spartans are not ten feet tall or superhuman.  By himself a Spartan while certainly strong and a good fighter, is no different than any other man.  What makes them so effective is that through their lifestyle and training they can all act as one individual, be they by the dozens or by the thousands.""A more RL edit of this movie would be better, like the giant bridge Xerxes built a mile long to reach Sparta, of scuttled ships."	4.0	Almost perfect	2008-08-12	5	0	5

However, to get the picture to look optimal on my TV (LG's 52LG70) it didn't look its best right out of the box. I had to tweak the various settings in my TV for this movie. I would venture to say that this is due in part to the fact that 300 uses a unique color scheme and requires a bit of tinkering around to get it to show off its true colors (no pun intended).The movie in its full glory looks realistic and is of higher quality then what you had in the theater.

There are also quotes from the real battle used in the movie.These quotes show the amazing bravery of the Greek fighters.This is a very engaging dreamlike account of a relatively small group of fighters who helped make a BIG difference in the history of Europe.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AQUVTQFFXP4AC	"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark"""	"2 hours of action yarn, eye candy, scrubbed-clean CGI violence, and lacking in everything essential to good storytellingFrom a visual perspective, 300 is something of a masterpiece.  But movies aren't supposed to be visual masterpieces---they're supposed to have decent dialogue, story, and substance to back it up.  That is what separates good movies from bad ones that look good.I've had my months leading up to the movie and afterwards of trashing this movie for not only its blazing historical inaccuracies, but it's ridiculous treatment of basic physics and logic.  Nowhere else can you see 300 naked men bellow at two massive elephants and send them toppling off a cliff, or a single naked man kill a charging rhino with little more than a flimsy wooden spear.Everything in 300 save for a scene with horses was filmed in a garage or warehouse against green or bluescreen, and while it makes for some visual spectacles, it removes a certain grittiness from it that fails to capture the audience and thrust them right in the midst of the action.Another major failing is the Spartans themselves.  The key to any superhero comic movie (because these Spartans can't be human) is for the hero to be endearing to the audience.  The director appears to have completely fumbled this, by making the main characters incredibly arrogant, intolerant, and smug, while giving them anachronistic ideals of freedom and liberty (like a Roman Emperor preaching equality for all men) which rather than preach, they bellow at one another.Rarely does Leonidas say anything that isn't shrieked in the most bellicose manner possible.  His lines range in depth and complexity from ""SPARTAAAAANS!  PUSH!""  ""SPARTAAAAAANS!!  PREPARE FOR GLOOOORY!!""  ""SPARTANS!!! WHAT TRADE DO WE PLY?!?!?!?!?!""  ""SPARTAAAANS!  WE WILL STAND AND FIGHT!!!""By failing to endear, and arrogance, I refer to several scenes, including when Leonidas first meets Ephialtes.  In history, Ephialtes was a normal goat herder or farmer, who betrayed the Greeks by revealing to Xerxes a goat path leading around the pass out of greed.  In the movie, he's a horribly deformed monster (akin to a mix of Gollum from LOTR and Joe Merrick, the Elephant Man), with a heart of gold, seeking to prove himself in battle.  His effort to hoist a shield and thrust a spear is almost heartwarming in its attempts, yet Leonidas haughtily says that since he can't raise his shield high enough for long enough, he can't fight in a phalanx (which is particularly ironic, since the Spartans never fight in a phalanx in the entire movie save for the first battle---the director Zack Snyder even admitted doing away with the phalanx because it wasn't ""cool enough"" for his movie), thrusting Ephialtes into a grief-ridden rage which causes him to betray the Spartans later on.Leonidas also very arrogantly mocks his Phokian allies for not being born to kill like the Spartans are.A lot of movie cross-over appears to happen, as Ephialtes very much resembles Gollum in Lord of the Rings, so too the Persian Immortals must have been dug up in Isengard, like the Uruk-hai in LOTR---they are not human, and look very much like Orcs.  And the ""Uber Immortal"" as it was so brilliantly labeled, was little more than a thinner, more muscular work troll like in Return of the King.Whatever humanity is left in the film is squandered for the more machismo audience.  Queen Gorgo's role is little more than to look like a frumpy 50 year old housewife, muttering about some incomprehensible thing or other while another Spartan attempts to court her.  Before Leonidas leaves, he treats the audience to a sex scene so dull and lifeless that it amounts to little more than a CG dry humping with Gorgo.  The end of this subplot culminates in the Spartan who has been flirting with her getting stabbed in the public forum while gold coins fly in the air and everyone bellows ""TRAITOR TRAITOR TRAITOR TRAITOR!!!!!"" as he falls to the floor, dead.To the battle scenes: As mentioned above, Zack Snyder admitted to doing away with the phalanx because it wasn't ""cool"".  So rather than attempt to give the audience something new, innovative, and unbelievably bloody and violent, he gives us the same old glorified one-man-army crap we've seen in a dozen action movies.  CG or not, there's little innovation or anything to impress with the action scenes.  Many times, you're left laughing or shaking your head in disbelief as the fighters go out of their way to look ""cool"" rather than deadly.  One case in particular is when a Persian Immortal has a clear shot at a Spartan, and chooses rather than to stab his naked chest, to drop his weapon and DROPKICK him.  There are also instances where the chosen nudity of Spartans goes against them, as they are easily speared through the back in instances where simple body armor would help.At some point, you get overwhelmed with the Spartans sticking Persians with their spears like hot knives through margarine, and giant waves of bodies keeling onto a wave of Immortals, and quite literally random slow-motion sequences showing off how close a hurled axe cuts Leonidas' helmet plume, or how many rope fibers are at the end of a Persian's whip, or how many beads of sweat drip down the bronzed and chisled chest of a Spartan.  Okay, we get it!  You have a 100 million dollar budget to spend on CG and you don't know how to show it off!There's little else going for the movie other than nonstop and often senseless action violence which gets excessive, broken only by the lonely and useless subplot with Gorgo looking frumpy and Spartan #2 forcibly kissing her.  Even if you were to look past the unbearably significant historical inaccuracies, the gaping holes in logic (like how 300 Spartans march off to battle without any supplies, no food or water or baggage train, with nothing but their capes, shortshorts, spears, helmets, and shields, or how a wooden spear to the head of a rhino manages to kill it within seconds, or how 300 naked men, no matter how great fighters, can withstand tens of thousands of heavily armored fighting elite Orcs and Elephants and Rhinos and Humans without too much trouble until Ephialtes steps in).An action yarn and a visual mess of action and sunset-colored landscape, little else from dialogue and script, acting, even sound, make it distinct in any sort of way.  I doubt many people in years to come would remember this as any more than ""That comic book movie like Sin City with Greeks"""	1.0	"""That comic book movie like Sin City with Greeks"""	2007-07-01	58	13	45
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	I will say first and foremost that if you are looking for an absorbing and well told story, as in engrossing plot and tightly woven script, then this is not the movie for you.  `300' plays out more like a videogame than a history lesson.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a romping good time with all the violence and women to make any mans fantasy come true then this is the film for you.  While I can't say that it is as fulfilling as `Gladiator' I can say that it is far more entertaining then recent swords-and-sandals fare like `Alexander' and will at least leave you very much entertained; that is, if you are entertained by blood and body parts.What is important to remember when considering watching `300' is that it is based on the graphic novel written by `Sin City' author Frank Miller.  These novels are graphic in more than the literal sense.  So, like `Sin City', `300' builds off of Millers foundation by adding more blood and more nudity.  Also, beings that this is based off of a graphic novel and not necessarily of off historical documents, some of the authenticity of the account has been altered.  For instance, depictions of superhuman men and gods are rampant throughout.  That isn't to say this is an inaccurate account all the way around, I just want to point out that things are not always painted authentically.The story is that of the battle at Thermopylae where 300 Spartan men fought against the much larger Persian army.  Spartan King Leonidas defies the oracles and engages in battle even after he was commanded not to.  After insulting Persian King Xerxes, Leonidas leads his men against an all out attack from the Persian army, but the mere 300 Spartans prove to be more than up for the challenge.Like I mentioned, `300' plays out like a videogame; a really cool looking and fun videogame, but a videogame at that.  The dialog is a bit cheesy and the acting is really nothing more than some macho men wearing close to nothing screaming at one another.  Gerard Butler looks amazing (he looks as if he could break my neck with his abs), as does his army and they all fight masterfully.  The fight sequences are phenomenally done, intense and gratuitous.  That's really why we're watching in the first place so one can't complain too much.  We were promised some impressive action scenes and we receive them in spades.  Having everything aside from the main actors CGI never hurt the film, which surprised me.  After watching CGI slowly erode films like `I Am Legend' I was half expecting this to be a complete mess with corny special effects and ridiculous enemies, but everything looks and feels real and amazingly detailed.In the end I would recommend `300' to anyone wanting a pure adrenaline rush.  Anyone not offended but gore should check this out.  Like my friend told me after the movie ended; this is one of those `get the guys together and throw back a few beers' type of movie; the type of movie that results in long hours at the gym and maybe a black eye or two.	4.0	One bloody `bloody' good time...	2008-03-24	0	0	0

The film turned it into a bloodfest of epic proportions - which it certainly was - but it was also a triumph of a small group who held a pass long enough for the main army to get settled and eventually kick some Persian butt.

What is that 1:66/1 aspect ratio I read in the specifications here at amazon? I think I saw the movie in the theater on a marvelous 2:35/1 ratio. Apart from unusual, the 1:66 is even a worst ratio than the 1:85. Can anyone tell me if it's only a mistake? Do the movie fit all the screen of your tv [1:85 aspect ratio]or not? I really DO prefer [and expected] the 2:35, and an aspect ratio closer to te 1:33 than any other seems to me a joke (and a bad one).Thanks!

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A19VMQDCB4HZ9P	"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen"""	I will get it out of the way and say that this was not and was not meant to be a historically accurate depiction of Ancient Greece. It was never meant to be even when it was still just an Eisner-Award winning graphic novel from the mind of iconic graphic novelist and artist Frank Miller. With that out of the way I was able to watch and enjoy Zack Snyder's film adaptation on its own terms without the criticism of historical accuracies looming dangerously over my head. 300 deserves the label of being the first event film of 2007. From start to finish, Snyder's film practically screams blockbuster and popcorn and I wouldn't have it any other way.Frank Miller's 300 was at its time an interesting depiction of one of history's greatest military last stands. Miller already known for hyperstylizing the look and feel of the noir genre with his Sin City graphic novels, takes the same approach with his depiction of King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans taking a final last stand against Persian God-King Xerxes at a narrow mountain pass called Thermopylae (literally meaning Hot Gates in Greek). Zack Snyder took this graphic novel and painstakingly stayed true to the visuals Miller and his colorist wife, Lynn Varley put on paper. Looking back at my memory of some of the panels and images from the graphic novel. Snyder and his crew of art directors, cinematographers and CGI-artists were successful in translating almost every page of the graphic novel onto the screen. Like Robert Rodriguez's adaptation of Miller's Sin City, Zack Snyder's 300 pretty much brings the graphic novel to moving life. This means he stuck to the source material quite literally which limits his own take on the graphic novel. And like Rodriguez Snyder doesn't really put his own signature stamp as a director to the film. It's not too much of criticism since he does a great job of translating Miller's work onto film, but one wonders what sort of personal touches he could've added to the finished look that wasn't lifted from Miller's style and whether it would've changed the overlook look and feel of the film.The story is quite simple and just takes the basic summary of the historical event itself. Spartan King Leonidas (played with visceral gusto and machismo by Scottish thespian Gerard Butler) makes a decision to go to war and confront the encroaching and fast approaching massive Persian Army led by Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) intent on conquering the Hellenic city-states of the Greek Peninsula. Persian ambassadors ride forth to demand oaths of fealty from those city-states ahead of the army's path. Sparta is one such city-state, but different from the rest of its Hellenic brethrens. Sparta has gone down in history as a word synonymous with unbending dedication to a strict, ascetic warrior code. Warfare and battle were what Spartans were born and trained to do from an early age. Weakness and physical imperfections weeded out from the time of birth (the film explains just what happens to male newborns with physical imperfections and deformities). The answer Leonidas gives the Persian delegation could be seen as somewhat extreme, but not contrary to his nation's warrior-culture of never surrendering and seeing death in battle the greatest glory for a Spartan to achieve. From this sequence right up to the end of the film we get to see just how much of a warrior culture the Spartans were in extreme detail.It's during the prolonged battle scenes between Leonidas' Spartans and Xerxes army which will have everyone chomping at the bit. If you have to see this film for any particular reason outside of watching superbly-trained underdogs slaughtering and endless supply of enemy troops then you will most likely be disappointed by the slower scenes away from Thermopylae. Indeed, this film and its original source material would've worked even better without the extra filler Snyder and his writers added to give the film more depth. I'm all for more emotional depth and characterization in my films but when a movie is all about a bloody and heroic last stand of a few against the many, scenes which slow the story down does more to break the rhythm and tone of a film than add to it. Other than a deeper understanding of the kind of partnership Leonidas had with his Gorgo, his Spartan Queen, most of the subplots added by Snyder and his writers could easily have been left out and still get a kick ass action epic.It's the action scenes which reall stand out visually. Some people might see the style tricks of speed ramping certain action sequences then slowing it down considerably to show the minute detail of the battle scene as being to gimmicky, but I would disagree and say it actually gives the movie a fable-like quality in its storytelling. One thing I have to say about Zack Snyder as a director (his remake of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead better than what detractors have made it out to be) is that he knows how to film action and with special mention to bloody and gory action. He makes these scenes of dismemberments, decapitations, and disembowlments look like a piece of performance art. These scenes of carnage would be considered extremely gratuitious if it didn't look so computer-enhanced good. Even the way the blood flows, spurts and splashes look like something Jackson Pollock would take interest in. The speed up and slow down of the sequences also gives the fight scenes a certain rhythm that once an audience picks up on will follow it through to the end. This is why the scenes back in Sparta with a duplicitous politician and his powerplay to assume control and power seem such a downer instead of enhancing the sacrifice of Leonidas and his men. Those scenes just feel tacked on and completely superfluous. Luckily, there's not enough of them to slow down the frantic pace developed by the battle itself.The performances by all actors involved really doesn't require too much criticism or reflection over. Gerard Butler does a great and convincing job as the Spartan King and his conviction in confronting Xerxes and his army with so few seem very believable. It's not a star-making performance but it does show that Butler can add a bit of gravitas to a character and role so basic in characterization. Lena Hedley is radiant as his partner and Queen. Despite the weird sounding name of Gorgo, Hedley plays the strong-minded and equally influential wife to Butler's Leonidas. It's only her scenes back in Sparta as she tries to rally her people to support their king which keeps these slower sequences from fully pulling down the film. Really, the performances are just done good enough to keep the acting from becoming too campy or too serious. It's an action film and with enough action going on in the movie I could forgive the writers (both Miller and the screenwriters) from scrimping on character build up.All in all, Zack Snyder's film adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 succeeds in bringing the book to moving life. Throughout the run of the film it was hard not to get lost in the beautiful visuals. Whether it was the muted color pallette which puts most of the scenes in an almost sepia-tone look to over-emphasizing certain colors to set a certain mood. From oversaturation of reds in one sequence to one where everything seem to be tinted with the many shades of blues at night. This is what 300 will be best remembered for. It's technical use of CGI to paint the environment in unrealistic but beautiful ways which gives the scenes a 3-dimensional look to them when the actors are superimposed over them. The film really is a painting come to life and it shows once again how computer technology has now afforded directors in making what used to be impossible logistically to something that could be done with the limit being the artist's imagination.This movie will not win many acting, directing and even screenwriting awards, but it doesn't have to for people to enjoy it. It will entertain and pull its audience into a living and modern retelling of a legend. Whether all that happened on the screen was exactly as it happened in 480 B.C. doesn't matter. What it does show is that through retelling down the years even all the embellishments added to the story of Leonidas and his men doesn't diminish the fact that they did something heroic. For those excited to see 300 I am preaching to the choir. For those who are not quick to fall to the hype given the film I still recommend it for the epic spectacle Snyder and his band of filmmakers have put on the screen.	4.0	A hyperstylized film adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel	2007-03-09	241	187	54

Wescott ""Bookwyrm"""	"300 is (loosely) based on the battle of Thermopylae, in which an alliance of Grecian city-states fought off the entire Persian Empire at the pass of Thermopylae in Central Greece. When the Greeks were betrayed by a local, the king of the Spartans took 300 of his men, 700 volunteers from Thebes and 1000 Helot slaves, and continued to fight the Persians while everyone else ran for their lives. Of course, the Spartans lost, but they took many, many Persians down with them, and gave Athens time to prepare...a massive naval fleet, which crushed the Persians at sea (loosely based, you see). The movie spices this up, of course, by throwing rhinoceroses, elephants, men with large crab arms grafted onto their bodies, hunch-backed men, lizard-like soothsayers, demonic, silver-masked Asianic warriors and one enormous...thing...that looks like the Hulk on steroids.For all intents and purposes, 300 plays a lot like a video game. The violence is ultra-stylized, the heroes are hit by wave after wave of enemies (much like Space Invaders, actually) and there's even boss battles, many of which you could probably figure out from the multitude of exotic creatures mentioned in the previous paragraph. Although the movie's Leonidas is, surprisingly, almost likable and not quite knuckle-headed enough to be a warrior-barbarian stereotype (although he comes close, sometimes), and while there are some genuinely touching moments where people die and friends and sons mourn afterwards, and although the ending scene is practically mythical, the movie isn't particularly great, and the violence will probably turn many people off.Why four stars, then? The answer is this: the dialogue. It's not clever, or even well-written, but it has you cheering right with the Spartans as they rip the Persians to shreds. Examples follow:Leo: Tonight...no-one dies!Spartan (or Persian, I forget): The arrows will block out the sun!""Leo: Then we will fight in the shade!Leo: TONIGHT, WE DINE IN HELL!Slogan of the movie: PREPARE FOR GLORY!Leo: Spartans! We march!Critics may hate this movie, parents may hide it from their preteen children and it may end up in the bargin bin ten years later, but I'm betting high-schoolers will be quoting these lines at each other for years to come. Love it or hate it, if you think you can handle it, you should see it at least once. Finally, a message to unbelievers--Persian: This is madness!Leo: No. THIS! IS! SPARTA!Leonidas then pushes the Persian into a bottomless pit, because, you know, all Grecian city-states had bottomless pits in those days. Madness, yes. But hey; it's Sparta."	4.0	Fun	2007-12-08	0	0	0

To really bring that quality out.I saw many frames in this movie (and shots) based around the comic book which i enjoyed, as will most other frank miller fans.My issue with this film is how much was spent on the actual visual affects could have given them reason to develope the story a little bit more.Just about the first 5-10 mins is the only well descriptive, well thought out and properly portrayed part of the movie. I feel if they had used a bit more of that tenacity with the rest of the script (a bit more, not over kill) we would have probably seen a better response to this movie.I still really liked the movie and will order it for future viewing, I cant help though and struggle to see what is so epic about this movie with other people.Its a good film.

I've always been inspired by the Battle of Thermopylae which was a major reason why I wanted to see it. I wasn't sure what to expect though. The way 300 was described by reviewers made it sound like a cross between a historical adaptation and a video game. The first thing I noticed, as did so many others, is that these frames are a visual feast. The battle scenes were absolutely outstanding. Gerard Butler makes for an excellent King Leonidas and David Wenham cast as Dilios was another magnificent decision and one which will hearten fans of The Lord of the Rings because his work as Faromir was near-perfect. His role here becomes larger and more brilliant as this film rolls forth. The most poignant message that this love note to antiquity delivers is that, contrary to what many a spoiled and plush westerner may otherwise believe, some things in life really are worth dying for. All of us will soon be dust but to retain our honor, virtue, and liberty in the process...well, those are the acts of an immortal.

In 480 BC, King Xerxes was targeting Greece as his next conquest. Sparta would have gone to war but for the Carniea, a festival in which the City State was not to engage in any battle. Leonidas, recognizing that Sparta was being targeted and soon, left his main army behind but took his personal guard, 300 warriors and 400 hundred other warriors from other city states nearby to Thermopylae to meet Xerxes forces. There is a bit of intrigue between Queen Gorgo and the traitor Theron and also between Leonidas and Ephialtes, the crippled traitor who eventually led the Persians to their final victory. While the history is cut and dried, the Graphics are beautiful. This is a montage of battle in the fashion of the Matrix. Most movements are slow motion and somewhat stylized This is from the view point of the Spartans, more importantly Dilios, who is storytelling this event.	5.0	This is Spartaaa!!!...........	2014-04-28	2	1	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3KUEXN9M9FOMH	billy	300 is like that cute blonde girl who works at Abercombie and Fitch.  She's hot, she has a nice body, but she probably has nothing interesting to say beyond how much she likes shopping for new shoes.  She's beautiful but empty and devoid of any substance.  She may be interesting on a purely physical level, but nothing else about her is all that interesting.Frank Miller's work made me fall in love with comics when I was an adolescent.  The Dark Knight Returns, Ronin, his Daredevil work, and Sin City are all classics of the genre.  After the mishandling of the Elektra story in the Daredevil movie with corny acting and inaccurate characterization, Robert Rodriguez's Sin City showed great reverence and faithfulness to the original Sin City graphic novels, and low and behold, that was movie was great.300 has a similar faithfulness to the source material that Sin City had.  Zach Snyder, the director of the surprisingly ok Dawn of the Dead remake, made an almost shot by shot remake of Miller's graphic novel, resulting in a visually appealing and exciting movie that is devoid of any real emotional substance or acting whatsoever, but hey, I wasn't really expecting any.300 tells the story of a small band of Spartan troops lead by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) who manage to hold of a massive army of Persians before eventually succumbing to superior numbers but never surrendering  The story is loosely based on the Battle of Thermopylae, and I stress the term loosely.  If you're looking for historical accuracy, read an academic treatment of the subject.  There is also a subplot of political intrigue involving  Theron, (Dominic West) and Queen Gorgo, Leonidas's wife played by Lena Headly, though that's not really important.What are important is the action sequences, which are simply gorgeous in a blood splattering, slow motion sort of way.  King Leonidas, and his band of shirtless macho dudes stave off hordes of prissy Persian's who dress in gaudy masks and costumes.  The action is the only reason to see this movie.  It's reminds of Kill Bill Vol. 1 because it's really nothing but an extended action sequence with some minor storyline elements thrown in.I enjoyed 300 on a purely visceral and violent level, but I have to comment on the lack of any real back story or strong acting.  All Gerard Butler is asked to do in this movie is scowl and yell out some macho phrases.  Dominic West, who some may know as Detective Jimmy McNulty from The Wire, is reduced to a mustache twirling caricature villain.  Those familiar with the subtly and complexity that he brings to McNulty will be disappointed with his flat characterization.  He was barely in the fourth season of The Wire, and I suspect that he was unavailable because he was making this movie.There are also some silly moments that made me laugh, even though I wasn't suppose to.  Are Spartan men never allowed to wear shirts, even when they are kids?,  Xerxes reminded me of Ru-Paul, and when Captain Artemis pours out his heart to Leonidas after his son is killed, I had to chuckle because the rest of the movie is so devoid of any emotion.  Plus there are some profoundly homoerotic themes.  I mean they are a bunch of buff dudes in leather bikini bottoms fighting in the hot gates.Anyway, I guess my complaints are fairly moot because no one goes in to this movie looking for great acting.  I know I didn't.  This movie ranks along side Kill Bill Vol. 1 and The Matrix Reloaded as great action pieces devoid of any real substance.  I would recommend this movie for a good time and a visual treat.  Try to see it on IMAX if you can, because all of the gory action and violence is larger than life on an IMAX screen.	3.0	Beautiful But Empty	2007-03-14	14	5	9

This is an exaggerated version of the battle of Thermopaylae.  The focus is on the 300 Spartan fighters (part of a force of roughly 2000) that led the defense against the invading Persian army.  The Persian army of around 2 million was held off by this tiny force for 3 days.  At that time, the Spartan soldiers were considered the best in the world, comparable to today's top Special Forces soldiers.  This movie does an excellent job of portraying the superiority of the Spartan soldiers. After leaving the theater I felt an immediate need to go to the gym.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2IGYM7K8MFJRC	Bo stergaard Jepsen	"Once again Frank Millers graphic novels are brought to the big screen and once again the product was very enjoyable. The production values of the film are top notch, the direction solid and the visuals a feast for your eyes. There is an exceptionally large amount of cgi shots in this film, which normally dosen't really tickle my fancy, but in this case it actually helps giving the film a comicbook feeling, that cannot be achieved through other means. Also the use of slow motion to almost freeze frame during the massive (and frequent) fight scenes, helped to get that ""comic"" feeling. It's like looking at a single frame in a graphic novel. The result is in effect very similar to that of ""Sin City"", which also had the feeling of being a ""moving comicbook"", if you get my meaning. Very good.The cast also performs well. I especially enjoyed Gerard Butler as King Leonid. He reminded me of Sean Connery (which is about as nice a thing that I can think of saying about any actor). He has the same accent, the same funny way with s's, the same understated comedic delivery of insults to his opponents and he displays a great physique.Historically inaccurate as it may be, it is still a very entertaining film. And then again, who takes their history lessons from the cinema?The storyline is simple and dosen't wander, yet it is still very compelling and it grips you very effectively. The story is really more about ideals which are common to us all and which we all wish to posses. It is about honour, glory, valour, righteousness and doing what you think is right. Highly recommendable."	4.0	A bloody good adaption	2007-04-28	21	14	7

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1CK146U5IFP8F	Brandon Mario	In short, this movie is a veritable visual spectacle on your 1080P television.  The content of the film itself is precisely what it aims to be and it is beautifully rendered in Blu-Ray in MOST instances.  There are certain darker scenes (such as when Dilios is addressing the assembled Spartan soldiers around the campfire) that simply did not seem to translate well.  While most of the dark scenes were rendered beautifully (i.e. not a calibration issue with the television), this and a few other dark scenes, had a noticeable amount of noise (over the entire area of the picture, not just the dark area).  By fine-tuning my LNT4671f I was able to mute the effect substantially from the out-of-box settings, but this problem is present ONLY in these scenes on THIS Blu-Ray movie (I have several).  Despite this minor quibble, the movie is spectacular, with all the glorious HD fight scenes you could ask for, and is really a stellar title for showcasing what your 1080p TV is capable of with the proper input.	4.0	Excellent quality, but with minor flaws	2007-11-09	0	0	0
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3HN7D7HEQGM1R	"Brendan Foy ""Foy"""	Now if only they would make a movie with a similar theme of heroism involving the troops in Iraq or Afghanistan.  This movie is a classic tale of self sacrifice for the greater good, of being a part of something more than yourself and laying it all out on the line.  Honor, duty and heroism are celebrated virtues in this movie.  At times it seems to glorify war, but if you pay attention to the story (which is admittedly thin) you will realize none of this carnage would have had to happen if the establishment class of society weren't too busy thinking of themselves.Without looking into the plot or themes too deeply, this is just an all around excellent film that is a blast to watch.  If it is entertainment you want, this is your film.Edit (November, 2010):  So it looks like the director, Zack Snyder, has been tapped to reboot the Superman franchise.  I couldn't be happier with this news, this is a bright young director and though I would like to see him continue to put out more original work, if Superman can bring the same mainstream success to him which Batman brought to the brilliant Christopher Nolan, I am all for it.	5.0	excellent movie.	2007-12-24	0	0	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2HZ2J6HVKG1CP	Brian Clifton	This movie is nothing less than spectacular.  The lore and story behind the battle of Thermopolae is already amazing enough... But the movie makers really capture and accentuate everything visually.  On Blu-Ray, this movie is really a treat for the eyesYou first have to realize this movie is being told to the viewer by one of the 300 soldiers.  It's his take on a historic event.  Of course not everything that happened in the movie happened in real life.  But you have to realize this is a tale people have been telling for centuries and centuries.  There are obvious embellishments (which are obvious to the viewer, such as the elephants, the rhino, etc) but I think these are true to what a storyteller in that period would tell his audience to captivate them.The audio commentary is great, the extras are great, and the movie itself is wonderful.  Whether this movie is on Blu-Ray or HD DVD, I would highly recommend it.	5.0	Visually amazing story telling at its best	2007-08-20	0	0	0

Erland	Watching the amazing. hallucinatory 2007 film '300' is a visual treat not soon to be forgotten, it's like experiencing history through the eyes of Salvador Dali. To make the viewing experience even more impressive is the inclusion of a highly intelligent script with dialogue that resonates with the audiences intellect and  emotions. Action and philosophy merge as one as deeds and word meld into a comprehensive worldview examining the paradigms of both the people of Sparta and those that would seek to enslave them. As the brave 300 battle against insurmountable odds a profound Spartan philosophy of war is lived out before your eyes and one comes to understand and embrace what they are doing and the reason behind their willingness to die for the greater good.'300' is a one-of-a-kind film that I will never get tire of watching.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A331ET5V2GEQPT	Brian McKechnie	This review was originally posted at criticizethis.net300 is a movie meant to be seen on the big screen. It's big, it's loud, it's a movie opera if you will. Watching it on HD-DVD is the closest you will get to that experience in your living room.The MovieBased on Frank Miller's graphic novel, the tale focuses on 300 Spartan warriors led by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) as they fight King Xerxes and the Persian army in the Battle of Thermopylae. It's a visually stunning masterpiece in the same vein as Sin City (another Frank Miller adaptation). The narrative story line, special effects, and soundtrack make 300 an experience in which your mouth will fall open in awe. The movie isn't without some flaws (where did that apple come from?), but it is much better than a majority of the big summer blockbusters.Picture & SoundThe movie looks amazing on a 1080p display. The colours, contrast, and shadows come alive almost as its own character, and the integral blood-flying scenes are vividly crisp. The sound is mind-blowing in Dolby TrueHD; every slice, stab, and groan during the battle sequences are audible, and the score gave me chills. This is one of the HD-DVD's I will be using to show off what high definition DVD is all about.Special FeaturesThe HD-DVD is loaded with features. An exclusive HD-DVD game called Vengeance and Valor lets you lead Spartans into battle with your remote control. Also included is a piece on Frank Miller's vision realized on film, webisodes from the set, extra footage of the Hunchback, never-before-seen footage of the Giant Warriors, plus featurettes on the truth behind the 300 Spartans, and how the actors built their characters.My favourite feature is the bluescreen picture-in-picture version of the movie. This is where you get to see how the movie was filmed (bluescreen background, etc.) in one window, while the final result plays in the other. It includes director Zack Snyder's commentary explaining the differences and how the scenes were created. When you see the amount of work that went into the movie, you'll definitely gain respect for its makers.Bottom-lineThis could be the title that makes people run out and buy HD-DVD players. If you already own one, pick this movie up and show all your friends what they're missing.300 (HD-DVD) **** (out of 5)Rated RDirected by Zack SnyderStarring Gerard Butler, Lena Headey	4.0	Criticize This!

If I can save a single person from wasting their money from seeing or buying this movie.............I will have saved at least one person from the misery of having to watch it. I gave this movie one (1) star becasue they will not allow you to rate a movie with zero (0)stars.  I am the type of person that will read a book, or watch a movie once I have started......no matter how bad it is. However, in the case of this movie I had to fast forward through much of the last half to spare myself the pain of watching it all. The graphic violence and sexual content are much more than necessary to tell what is already a great story (many good movies are made without resort to this type of cheapness). The acting is of the poorest quality, the script is bad, and the emotion that should be illicted by such a great story is not to be found.Several people (in comments) feel I misled myself with my own set of expectations and because I may not have realized this movie was only based on a comic book (which apparently is all that a 'graphic novel' turns out to be. That is all correct. It still does not change the fact that this is a very poor excuse for entertainment.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3N6GAJTEOF4MO	Caleb Williams	"War is something that has been around since the existence of man, we as a species are naturally violent and although some people will disagree. To an extent war and violence is beautiful, depending on how it is portrayed and 300 is one of them films that portrays war in its greatest beauty. The beauty of the war told in this film is the beauty that only 300 men defended their land against the invasion of The Persian King Xerxes and his army of men almost 20 times as big. The defending of a kings family and home against an army who he is unconcerned of its size is simply beautiful as it tells of the human nature of self sacrifice to save those we love.To those familiar with the original 1962 film ""The 300 Spartans"" this can simply be described as a jazzed up remake of the original, which can cater for todays audience. This is certainly CGI friendly with pretty much 80% of the whole film setting being in CGI. Also some of the major events in the film slow down and is shown in complete slow motion which I feel added to the drama and impact of the battle scenes and a particular individual event.Being jazzed up, I think I made a bit of an understatement as some of the major villains in this film are so overdone it becomes quite ridiculous. Whether that be Xerxes being close to 10 feet tall or whether that be the oricles looking too un-human to be passed off as real. This in a way I think is too much as it pulls away from some of the true hystorical elements that inspired this story. Some people would think that the fancy gore effects or the strange looking villains would be a cool thing, but being a true fan of cinema this was one of the only things I hated about this film.The acting is dramatic, the action is intense and Gerard Butler makes a spectacular King and is a great leading man. He seems to express a passion and charisma that you don't regularly notice in a role like this. The fight scenes are plentiful and seem to have been choreographed to an extent which makes it truly inspiring and there doesn't seem to be a single point where you can say ""looks like they missed a step there""On a lighter note the film is very camp with the whole army being very rugged with washboard abs and seeming to wear what can only be described as tight fitted underpants. This has also received a bit of criticism for containing racist undertones with the whole enemy army being black or dark skinned. This is something to be left up to the viewer as I didn't really see the big deal or the justification in that criticism, although I do suspect some people will understand the criticism.I would suggest that you rent this before you buy it, it's what I like to call a Marmite movie.You either love it or you hate it."	5.0	War Is Beautiful And So Is 300	2008-02-08	1	1	0
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1GHUN5HXMHZ89	"C. A. Luster ""The Rook"""	"This is an exceptional visual comic book like fantasy movie, but not factual. The huge monstrous men, Rhinoceros, and other imaginative additions that weren't in the real battle should tell you that. This is visually and FX wise a treat, but it doesn't have the depth, truth, or feeling that ""The 300 Spartans"" has. If you think this is anything more than taking a true event and crossing it with a heavy metal cartoon, you are mistaken. I love ""Heavy Metal"" and FX as much as the next person. ""300"" and ""The 300 Spartans"" are likely to be watched by guys the most. Both have there special merits, but for owning, I think ""The 300 Spartans"" is better. ""300"" deserves at the very least a rental to see all the great visual work, some decent acting, and good storyboard scripting. I suggest you see both movies and decide for yourself. Each will leave you with your needed dose of heroism and great battle carnage, but they both may not give you the depth of character or make you feel you saw history made. BTW, don't waste your time voting negative if you haven't even seen ""The 300 Spartans"". Nothing that makes me want to trash a movie more than negative votes from people that don't even take the time to be objective and actually see something else. So if I get alot of negative votes I will know it is people that haven't even seen ""The 300 Spartans"".Anyone that has seen ""The 300 Spartans"" knows that all CGI alone used in ""300"" does not make a good movie. Acting and special effects used instead tends to improve the quality. Had this movie had more of a living cast and used some real life special effects it would have been much better. The music needed improvement as well. I liked the music for ""Gladiator"", ""Conan the Barbarian"", and ""The 13th Warrior"", I wasn't impressed with the music for ""300"". Does it have some good acting and great effects? Absolutely. I am certainly not saying don't see this movie. I'm just not giving it 5 stars to put it in the same class as movies like ""Gladiator"", ""The 13th Warrior"", ""Conan the Barbarian"", ""The 300 Spartans"", ""Spartacus"", and ""Ben Hur"". It is good, just not that good. Oh one other thing, I find it amusing when a reviewer says critics aren't needed. We could say the same about fans of movies. If you are just going to lob praise all over a movie, what's the point of reading your review? Objectivity would not be present. When I read a review with some criticism and some comparison to other works I know there is at least a shred of objectivity. That helps me decide whether a movie is worth my time, not when someone can't stand anyone to criticize any part of it."	3.0	300 vs The 300 Spartans	2007-03-15	18	6	12

That being said I personally LOVED this movie. The battle scenes are as groundbreaking as The Matrix and as breathtaking as The Lord of the Rings. I was wowed by the shots of all three hundred Spartans fighting in force to push back the hordes of Persians attacking them and if that had be how all the fighting sequences were it would be an equal to any recent action movie, but the really amazing part of this movie was the super slo-mo battles between individual Spartans and Persians.As good as the action in this movie was I could not whole heatedly give this movie five stars. I thought it made the movie silly and clich&eacute; to have the Persian army consist of fifteen foot monsters capable of taking a knife in the eye and bicep without being injured obese executioners with axes for hands. The main body of the Persian army consists of Immortals who are depicted somewhat like the orcs in The Lord of the Rings not to mention that Xerxes the leader of the Persians is showed as a eight foot tall gay guy. This was by far the worst part of the movie. I understand that the director was tied to the comic book and had to keep similar to it, but this aspect could have easily been dropped from the movie. I don't mind the monsters because it isn't historically acurate, i don't mind that this movie doesn't follow the real story of the Spartans, I just thought it was unimportant and constantly reminded me I was in a movie and that all this action in front of me was just filmed in front of a green screen.While I think that this movie should have differed from the comic book with the monsters and immortals, I think it should've stayed with Frank Miller's version and left the queen of Sparta with a much smaller role. I thougt the love interest between her and Leonidas was dumb and on such a different pace from the rest of the movied that it made it pass inexorably, whereas alone it might have been intriguing.This movie is much better since it was cut loose from the real history and I think that anyone who is focused on talking about how unrealistic this movie is completely misses the point of the movie. This is not a movie based on history, but a movie based on a comic book. Again I will stress how incredible the fighting in this movie is. I never tired of watching the Spartans and Persians battle, and I thought the variety of the fighting was responsible for this.

"While war and violence are morally wrong in the abstract human philosophies, shifting cultural sensibilities, and our (USA) pampered day to day existence, It is still part of who we are and it seeps out through our art into our society. We are the way God made us or how we evolved biologically, depending on your views. Either way, we are a violent species. Even if that is lost in the day to day world we live in, there is still an appetite for it. Our art, video games, TV, media, and films serve it up. Since the critics are not artists it is hard for some of them to see the truth of this film and many others released in recent years. Their tunnel vision, sour grapes, or just angry twisted lives make many of them compelled to spit vile upon anything visionary, or even just decent. I have grown tired of reading angry reviews where the reviewer writes as though he or she knows better and almost seems to pity us ignorant peons, lemmings, or what even the hell they consider us to be. Myself, my family, and my friends are not idiots and no where, except perhaps with people who rarely see films, are such conceited, self-important, and egotistic views represented by the people I know within the word I live. This film was great, pure and simple. It will be remembered as a great action film long after the drivel action of the day is forgotten.300 holds you in it's grip from second one to the last scene. It is the sublime beauty of war that Joseph Campbell mentions in his works. Frank Miller has been an artist I have admired since I was a young boy. He has quietly been working away for the last several decades with no huge critical juggernaut coming down on him and suggesting he is pandering to any political dogma of the day. Now that the film is made, which is as close an adaptation as any author could hope for, the liberal critics are there, striking away at a work that spoke to Miller as a child. To suggest any political significance is reaching beyond ones wildest dreams. Real artists do not push political dogma, they represent what is in their soul and hearts. These news paper pandering nancy boys have nothing better to do than regurgitate hogwash in such a backwards fashion that even they themselves are just running in circles and making no real headway with what ever it is they think they should be doing to better this world. 300 is a film not a political movement. To criticize it as if it could convert people into middle East haters is just stupid. The Middle East and the USA do just fine gathering up enemies and haters all on their own. One small film, even one that would be an overt outright bash on either the East or the West would not sway the masses more than a drop in an ocean either way. To point out black and white racist overtones not intended is racist itself.As grand and spectacular as 300 is, it's still just entertainment for popular culture. It's stylized so much that to speak in terms of historical accuracy is just silly. Too many films of our times have passed themselves off as pseudo documentaries in order to effect some kind of cultural awakening or change when all they do is preach to the converted. Films are made in so many ways and varieties that it is just as amusing to watch the critics scramble between ""Norbit"" and ""Flags of our Fathers"" and all the while trying to maintain some level of intelligence rather than just reviewing films each on it's own merits for what it is and who it's trying to reach. Since so many films these days seem to annoy the critics I often wonder why they are film critics at all. They seem more suited to be writing angry complaint letters to companies about some busted back yard sprinkler. I want reviews, not angry critiques!Go away critics. You are not wanted. You are not needed. You are a sorry pitiful lot.A critique for the critics by a true film goer and viewer."	5.0	The most spectacularly fundamental action film of all time (Critics go home!)	2007-03-11	731	523	208

It's gorgeous to look at and the action sucks you into the movie.My comments are more about the Blue-Ray format for this movie and in general.  I feel Sony needs to step up and give us a bit more for the money.  There are two-discs versions and super duper reextended quadruple edited versions of this film and many others.  But when it comes to the Blue-Ray, nothing.  Not even an insert in the case with the chapters, film info, actors, nothing.  For the money we pay for these movies, I think they can put a little more content into the discs and the packaging.

To organize my discussion, I suggest that we take one step back in the causal chain and embark on a new path towards change. What I mean to say is that I have a tendency to report the more sensational things that 300 is up to, the more shocking things, things like how it wants to call evil good and good evil. And I realize the difficulty that the average person has in coming to grips with that, but while it insists that we have no reason to be fearful about the criminally violent trends in our society today and over the past ten to fifteen years, reality dictates otherwise. Actually, if you want a real dose of reality, look at how as far as being namby-pamby is concerned, none of 300's devotees holds a candle to it. Do I blame society for this?

If one were to believe everything they heard, they would think that ""300"" was the biggest thing since Casablanca...or at least the last super hype movies I can think of like ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""Titanic"".First off, the film is told, or rather transposed, from a graphic novel.  We basically are getting a fancy cartoon about a story that has already been told a thousand times.  I have yet to read a single review that has even gone over any of the technical aspects of this movie and stepped back and looked at it from the ""big picture"".  Step away, put the straw down and use some peripheral people.Hype wear off now?  Okay, so all I can say is that the storyline is great, and the dialogue is okay.  It is based off of a comic book so the whole ""we'll blot out the sun"" with arrows machismo got a little old.  They mix some legend and myth together and throw in the details that are widely known.  In the end you have a monstrosity of a film that, as mentioned before, is cool but nothing more than a fancy cartoon.That is what movies are now, just remakes and comic book adoptions.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3VIOCJZ22JZXT	C. B Collins Jr.	Much can be said regarding historic accuracy and depth of message in this film. Therefore, to fully enjoy the film you need to understand that this film is only loosely based on the resistance of King Leonidas of Sparta against the forces of King Xerxes of Persia at the Straits of Thermopylae. Also, the film is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and therefore the plot lines are very direct and the screenplay by Zack Snyder and Kurt Johnstad is written in maxims and declarative statements. That being said, the film is entertainment particularly targeted to adolescent males and young men. It is the exact opposite of a 'chick flick'. The film is violent but the violence is choreographed to a high degree, and even displayed in slow motion in many parts of the film. The film is archetypal in the Jungian sense in that Leonidas plays not only a king, but the archetype of a king resisting power over his range of actions. Xerxes is not only the king of Persia but he is the larger archetype of the forces that curtail and suppress individual expression and independent action. Thus the film will have an archetypal appeal to young males who sense the ever creeping social constraints upon individual action and who wish to strike back with heroic action.The film is a visual treat even if there is much violence and bloodletting. The acting is over-the-top, almost operatic in its use of grand gesture. There is no way to over-act in a film that is attempting to push limits and provide an operatic grand statement.Gerard Butler is excellent as Leonidas. He is the finest visual example of the archetype of the Greek King from Greek Mythology that I have ever seen on film. He is supported by beautiful Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo. These two lead actors are surrounded by a cast of virile men, revealing much of their beautiful bodies. Dominic West as the traitor politician makes a fine villain. David Wenham as the one-eyed story-teller Dilios does a fine job (you will recognize him as the tragic Prince Faramir in the Lord of the Rings films). Vincent Regan is allowed more dramatic range than most of the other actors as he plays a Captain who grieves the loss of his youngest son on the battlefield. Andrew Tiernan plays the hunchbacked Spartan who turns traitor. He is an excellent actor (see him in the Horatio Hornblower series as a mentally disturbed sailor). Finally, Rodrigo Santoro is over-the-top as the homoerotic giant King Xerxes. He appears almost nude in every scene, conveying a sense of both masculine and feminine power.Relax and don't try to make this film into some historic or philosophical statement. It is visually striking entertainment. It is testosterone driven so as to appeal in particular to young men. However woven into the matrix of the film is a dream-like archetypal story of struggle and resistance against overpowering force.	4.0	Visually overpowering and technically cutting edge film	2008-01-01	0	0	0
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3K1JFYC9KOVV5	CB	Long before this film came out, there was Frank Miller's superb graphic novel (still in print, by the way, and well worth the read), and I was a great fan of it. Thus, when I caught wind that a motion picture version was coming out, I was quite excited. Naturally, I expected the film to deviate (as so many comic book films do) from the original source material. While 300 keeps the tone (and the look, by golly!) of the graphic novel, it takes too many liberties with the source material to make it a reverent adaptation.Taking place in 480 B.C., 300 tells the tale (as retold by Frank Miller) of the battle of Thermopylae, in which a small confederation of Greeks (including 300 Spartans) held off the army of the Persian emperor Xerxes for three days - the largest army of its time. In the end, the Spartans stayed behind at the site and were all slain. Miller's graphic adaptation was an artistic and narrative triumph, creating a great deal of care for the characters and setting the work in a golden, rocky version of the Greek countryside. Much of Miller's artistry is reproduced here - costumes, colors, even individual panel illustrations are featured with loving care and dazzle the eye. Additionally, the fight scenes are brilliant and rival any previously filmed. 300 seems to have been filmed in a manner similar to Sin City, and thus digital wizardry abounds, to good effect.However, the film delights too much in violence and we find that we have no care whatsoever for the characters. Gerard Butler, who is the spitting image of Miller's rendition of the Spartan king Leonidas, while he cuts an impressive figure, cannot make the dialogue (much of it taken from the graphic novel) poignant and simply spits the lines out through bared teeth. Additionally, a tacked-on and pointless sub-plot with Leonidas' queen, Gorgo, goes nowhere and seems to have been added simply to pad out the time. Overall, a fine action film, but it falls far short of the grandeur of the graphic novel.	3.0	Superb Action, But a Far Cry from the Graphic Novel	2007-09-15	2	0	2

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2PBV1899CX3TE	"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!"""	"300 tells the story, first recorded by the ancient historian Herodotus, of 300 Spartan Warriors, led by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler); who fought off the much larger army of King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) at Thermopylae. Though all 300 Spartans perished at 'the hot gates' of Thermopylae, and thus there were no witnesses to tell what actually happened, we can only imagine. Director Zack Snyder (The Watchmen) and Graphic Novelist Frank Miller (Sin City), have, however, done a great job of bringing the ancient legend to the silver screen.------------Queen Gorgo: Spartan!King Leonidas: Yes, my lady?Queen Gorgo: Come back with your shield, or on it.King Leonidas: Yes, my lady.===================It is a shame that lately Gerard Butler has become the go-to guy for lame romantic comedies like The Bounty Hunter or The Ugly Truth, as the gruff but loveable leading man. I suppose he is having fun, as you can't pick up a tabloid without reading about his backstage and H-wood party exploits with Madonna and all and sundry, but it seems like a tragic waste. He is going the Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers) route rather than the Russell Crowe (Gladiator) highway. In other words, Butler brought a lot of depth to his character in 300, but didn't live up to his potential by later choosing more demanding dramatic roles.----------Earth! render back from out thy breastA remnant of our Spartan dead!Of the three hundred grant but three,To make a new Thermopylae!~ Lord Byron, from Don Juan, Canto iii, Stanza 86, 7================300, like Starship Troopers (I'm thinking more of the Robert Heinlen book than the movie which lampooned it), posits a militarized society, where young boys are examined for any defects, and if any are found, they are left to die. Brought up hard, made to fight from an early age, they must fight to survive. This upbringing culminates in a rite of passage whereby the young Spartan must confront a wolf with only a spear to defend himself. The real foe for him is fear. He must conquer his fear so that he can fight with a clear head.-----Dilios: When the boy was born, like all Spartans, he was inspected.==========Though it seems that the rigid discipline of military life is a kind of slavery, paradoxically, the idea of democracy was born in Ancient Greece. They consider themselves free men and fight to defend that freedom.--------O love, O celibate.Nobody but meWalks the waist high wet.The irreplaceableGolds bleed and deepen, the mouths of Thermopylae.~ Sylvia Plath, suicide at 31, faces her own Thermopylae walking in the garden in the poem ""Letter in November""==============---------Persian: A thousand nations of the Persian empire descend upon you.

Elliot, Sylvia Plath, A.E. Houseman, and Emily Dickinson. It is a very inspiring story, and centuries later, King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans at Thermopylae are still remembered.------------Xerxes: You Greeks take pride in your logic. I suggest you employ it. Consider the beautiful land you so vigorously defend. Picture it reduced to ash at my whim!

It is a geniusly orchestrated and well directed movie, full of action, romance and aesthetic beauty.But I will tell you I bought the Blu-Ray expecting it to be an even more breathtaking experience but was HORRIFIED from the result.  The contrast was so high I could see the pixels blinking (more like dancing) in the cloudy backgrounds and on the actors skin. It was SO distracting, I could not concentrate on the movie's content.  I tried messing around with color and contrast settings but to no avail.  Watching the same movie from my roommate's DVD seemed to have the same, if not better quality.At first, I was immediately terrified that my TV was not compatible to my Blu-Ray player (just bought the Blu-Ray player and 300 happened to be the first BD I popped in). Then I speculated that I had bought a crap HDMI cable (it was only 5 bucks. though I had done the research to confirm which HDMI cables are good and this one was) and would have to wait another 2 weeks to buy one that was 12 times more expensive just to see if it that was the case.  Just when I had almost convinced myself that my TV's processor was too slow, logic crept in.  I popped in my Batman Begins Blu-Ray.  Crystal clear and absolutely breathtakingly crisp picture.  No contrast horrors to be seen.  I found myself watching 30 minutes of the movie (that I've seen a million times) because I was amazed by the picture quality.  Then came the deal sinker, popped in my WALL-E Blu-Ray.  The picture quality was sooooo amazing that I watched the movie three times in a row (that, and the movie itself was insanely cute and entertaining).So alas, 300's horrible demise as a Blu-Ray was NOT an incompatible/slow TV, NOT a busted Blu-Ray player, NOT a crap HDMI cable.It was the Blu-Ray itself.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say it may have just been a bad burn but I would return this Blu-Ray in a heartbeat and just buy a widescreen DVD for my collection.

"It never ceases to amaze me how many great films of our time get pushed by the wayside by people and torn down for being ""original"" and actually interesting. I've read so many scathing reviews about this movie on all this site's forums and it pains me to hear it. I've read reviews like ""The world would be a better place if this movie had never been made."" Which clearly state to me that many people obviously do not have the stomach for great films. They would rather sit back in their cozy little hovels and watch films that would make anyone who has a decent head on their shoulders go mad with the absurd stupidity of so many third-rate movies these days. To anyone who may be a fan of these such movies...do everyone in the world a favor and just destroy your computers now. Lest we be forced to listen to more incessant bickering from third-rate society members.The film adaptation of Frank Miller's ""300"" is a compelling and graphic rendition of the battle of Thermopylae Pass. A cornerstone of military doctrine for more than 2500 years. A clear reminder of how skill, tactics, and the concept of fighting for freedom are more powerful than even the largest and mightiest foes. Read your history for a change instead of the latest ""Brad, Jen, and Angelina weekly whine-fest"". (Seriously...nobody cares.)Now I will admit that yes, this is anything but fact. This is Hollywood fiction based on a few key facts. Not anything to be taken as absolute. However for what its worth this movie delivers not only an impressive cast that well portray the brutality and viciousness of bronze-age combat, but also a visual feast of action and adventure. Remember that this film was shot entirely on green-screen and then later rendered into the environment of Greece's terrain. Admittedly this is a very surprising move to make and it was exceptionally well pulled off. This could very well be a herald of what we can expect in not too distant future films.Sure, there was sex, blood, violence, and nudity...If that's the only reason anyone went to see this movie then I worry for the future of mankind. This film demonstrates the power that a great plot can put to any film.Hands down this is an absolute must-have movie. An epic tale of life, death, honor, glory, and most importantly...freedom and patriotism."	5.0	Prepare for glory!	2007-10-09	1	1	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AB34G6VKP28L	"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic"""	"One of the most visually impressive films I have ever seen, 300 is based on a comic book's interpretation of the battle between the Spartans and the Persians in 480 B.C.The life of a Spartan is that of a soldier. From infancy, the sons are raised to know and train with the blade, then sent into the wilds to prove themselves worthy of joining the army. That is the story of King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), who has ruled over Sparta with tremendous strength and courage. But forces are stirring beyond their borders and a messenger comes to inform him that the King of Persia, Xerxes, intends to claim these lands as part of his ever-increasing kingdom. Bolstered in courage by his outspoken wife Gorgo (Lena Headey), the response from Leonidas is to seek the wisdom of the oracle in whether or not to go to war. Corrupt and well-paid by those who would secretly support Xerxes, the oracle's servants warn him against such an action. According to the laws of Sparta, the king cannot take his armies to war without their consent, so he forms a legion of 300 willing men to accompany him as an ""escort"" to the mountain pass where the Persians will attempt to enter their shores.There, they engage in fierce combat and one that might put an end to Xerxes' ambitions to conquer Sparta once and for all, little realizing that there is a potential traitor lurking on the outskirts. While this is certainly a testosterone-driven movie and may as such appeal to primarily men, I found much to enjoy about it. The cinematography and backdrops were all computer-animated and while this is apparent, the audience doesn't care because it is so rich and unique to anything we have seen before that it opens our imagination to an entirely new world. I am not often impressed and in this case, I was very impressed -- not only with the visual graphics, but the seamlessness in which the actors are incorporated into it. The costuming is limited but the designers have found way to emphasize the culture through what garments there are. The armor and absence of more than a single garment on most of the men is not historically accurate, but done to underline the principles of their society, which is an emphasis on masculinity. Those intrigued by ancient history will also find it interesting to note that this is the same Xerxes mentioned in scripture (although this one is nine feet tall!).The acting is quite good and so is the hair styling and the make-up, particularly on the servants of the oracle and the hunchback. The music is slightly familiar but wonderfully dramatic and it's easy to like the warriors. But this movie is not for everyone -- there's a fair amount of nudity, sexuality, and gore. The religious symbolism is striking, particularly in the parallels between Xerxes and Satan. Both tempt the hero with fame and riches if they will but ""bow to me."" It's not a happy story by any means but it is inspirational in the sense that it is all about courage. 300 men manage to hold off the entire Persian army with minimal casualties throughout much of the story, proving to the audience that it only takes a few standing for right to make a difference."	3.0	Bloody!

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A37E6RW5BUX4U0	Cherise Everhard	I went to this movie solely to see Gerard Butler as I am a huge fan.  If he wasn't in it I definitely wouldn't have paid to see it at the theater and chances are I wouldn't have worked real hard to see it on DVD, either.  It is not at all the type of film I normally flock to or enjoy, but I was more than pleasantly surprised at how much I thoroughly enjoyed this film.This is probably one of the most visually appealing movies I have seen in a long time.  It was like watching artwork come to life, a feast for the eyes.  The acting was excellent; Gerard Butler was a strong and commanding lead as King Leonidas. He was a physically imposing warrior, leading his men to battle, yet there were surprisingly tender and human moments as well. Lena Headey managed to portray Queen Gorgo as a strong, powerful woman, while maintaining extreme femininity.  King Xerxes was by far the most flamboyant of characters, his costume was of multiple piercings and jewels, he exuded arrogance and narcissism.  A powerful man, who referred to himself as God, was made complete by his large size and deep voice.I was expecting an overly violent blood bath of a film.  Truth be told, I was surprised at its lack of violence.  A lot of the violence is implied and then you see the flinging and spurting of blood.  There were only a few scenes where I actually cringed or had to shut my eyes.  There were even a handful of touching moments that made me weepy, another unexpected. The music was another unforeseen enjoyment. It flowed seamlessly from hauntingly beautiful chant like choruses to powerfully driven techno beats.  I liked the music so much, that I remained after the movie to watch the credits and find out who did the soundtrack.Is this movie historically accurate?  Will the History Channel be airing it as a documentary meant to educate the masses on the Spartans, the Persians and the battle of Thermopylae?  Absolutely not.  I went to see a movie based on a comic book, loosely based on history and that's what I saw.  300 is a very entertaining movie and I will definitely be purchasing it on DVD.	5.0	I Am Wowed!	2007-04-02	149	114	35

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3JCYX3A4SUYLF	Chones	So many people reviewed this movie well before it came out, I thought I'd review it AFTER I actually watched the blue-ray version...I have been waiting to buy this movie on Blue-ray. I saw it in the theater & knew it was a must have for my PS3.  I was not disappointed.  I won't bore you with the details.  For those of you who haven't seen the movie, buy it because it is a pretty good movie.  Lots of action sequences - actually the entire movie is like one large action sequence.  The battle scenes are filmed in a realistic manner.  It's just an all around well made movie.For a comparison one might look at Gladiator - the same type of lofty ideals of freedom, liberty, inundate the movie.  Lots of grandiose speeches that can tug at the most unpatriotic heart-strings. And of course the fight sequences were amazing.  One could argue that Gladiator ushered in a new era with its fight sequences/cinematography -- same here with HD and 300.  The makers of this movie certainly set a high bar for anyone else who is thinking about producing a movie of this caliber.In my opinion, the beauty of the movie lies in the detail & the cinematography.  On a purely ascetic level, this movie is brilliant.  This is the first blue-ray movie I've watched on my PS3 so take my review for what its worth...but I thought it was great.  I mean the detail was superb.  The dirt, blood, sweat, and individual hair on the characters jump out at you.  One could probably count the individual stalks of grass that seem to permeate many of the scenes if one was inclined.The bonus features are your standard DVD variety - the making of, historical breakdown of the actual events, etc.  I bought it at best buy for $30 plus tax, so I think $24 @ Amazon w/ free shipping (if you get up to $25 or whatever the threshold is) would be worth it.  $30-35 for a movie may sound like a lot - especially when the DVD version goes for $15, but I think the level of detail you get with blue-ray is well worth it.  All & all I am very satisfied with my first blue-ray movie purchase.As for you blue-ray vs. hd-dvd people, I haven't a clue which is better.  I know that at this point I only had enough money for a PS3, so I am buying blue-ray & this movie looked great to me.  To each his own I guess.4 stars because I wanted more of a story to go with all the fighting...but if I were to rate it based on ascetics alone, it would definitely be a 5.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A18G7GG53G2X8A	Chris Pandolfi	"Ah, to be male in Ancient Greece: ""300"" is a testosterone-driven fantasy in which all men are fearless warriors, driven by the need for battle and bloodshed. War is depicted as gloriously as any geek loner-type could hope for, with every soldier being the epitome of strength, courage, and physical brute force. Emotional bonding, sensitivity, and compassion don't even come into play; these men were trained to be ruthless killing machines, all in the name of preserving the glory of Sparta. This would no doubt be a ridiculous film if the story were presented in a straightforward, mainstream way. But straightforward and mainstream, ""300"" is not; this is pure, hard-driving escapism, from the frenetic battle sequences to the elaborate special effects to the over the top performances. In this sense, it's absolutely brilliant.And it gets even better. Every shot, every setting, and every event is accentuated by a look so stylized that it's practically a living duplicate of Frank Miller's original graphic novel. This was achieved through computer-generated imagery, which was responsible for creating most of the film's locations. Bluescreen technology--also utilized for another incredible Miller adaptation, 2005's ""Sin City""--made for a majority of the sets, leaving very little for the actors to actually work with. I can only imagine the effort that went into post-production, the endless hours of crafting landscapes, characters, and special effects all with the click of a mouse. The work paid off; the end product is an effectively heightened reinterpretation of reality, a kind of living illustration that transcends any sense of time or place. It's the perfect look for war story of this caliber, something so grandiose and overplayed that you can't get enough.The plot is fairly simple: it's a retelling of the 480 BC Battle of Thermopylae, in which the Spartans fought against the Persians. King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his army of a mere 300 soldiers are ready to defend their land against the evil King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). This is despite the fact that 1) they don't have the blessing of the gods to go to war, and 2) they will fight against an army of over one million. But this matters not; Spartan males are trained to be warriors at a very early age, essentially the day that they're born (only the largest, strongest newborns are spared; the small, sickly ones are unceremoniously thrown off of a cliff). They are taught the fine art of combat. They are made to take all kinds of physical pain, including lashings. They are conditioned to never retreat, even when facing insurmountable odds. Leonidas successfully survived such rigorous training (his first major battle was against a monstrous wolf with glowing eyes), as did the rest of his men. Now, they are ready for battle.And after taking position near a beachfront cliff, the Spartans engage in ferocious battle with the Persians. Never on film has war been so much fun to watch. This is probably because each sequence was beautifully photographed; even graphic shots of stabbings, amputations, and decapitations are so artfully constructed that it's hard to accept them as deplorable. The bodies of Persian soldiers are used to construct a blockade of surprising strength. Blood spatters from gaping wounds in dark, unrealistic globules, effectively looking more like spots of ink. There's a moment when arrows fly through the air in numbers so vast, they block the light of the sun. Nearly every shot is drawn out, often going in slow motion to show how carefully choreographed the gratuitous violence is.The Spartans also fight against the Immortals, an army of ghastly yet fantastical creatures with an appetite for destruction. They were appropriately crafted as one-dimensional barbarians, made more effective because of their appearances; they wear long black robes, and their pale, monstrous faces are hidden behind Tragedy-style silver masks. Where they came from is anyone's guess. I suppose it doesn't really matter, especially since they pave the way for a number of other ghoulish creatures that would give the creations of Clive Barker a run for their money. They--and every aspect of the film, for that matter--make it obvious that the real emphasis is on style instead of story, which under different circumstances would make for a miserable experience. But in this case, it works quite well; while a definite story is being told, it would be of little significance were it not for the special effects.This isn't to say that the story of ""300"" is bad. Quite the opposite: despite being simplistic, the story is quite strong, especially when a couple of subplots are factored in. Back in Sparta, Leonidas' wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), is up against a corrupt Senate, already bought out by the Persians in order to ensure Sparta's stability. The arrogant and treacherous Theron (Dominic West) is clearly not ready to handle a woman of such strength, especially since she fully supports Leonidas and Sparta's involvement in the war. Because she intends to plead to the Council for the deployment of more soldiers, Theron challenges her authority by exclaiming that her words will fall on deaf ears.Another subplot involves Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan), a hunchbacked, hideously deformed Spartan who begs to join with Leonidas and fight against the Persians. Leonidas appreciates his passion, but refuses to let him fight; he's unable to lift his shield, and this would only create a weak spot in their defense system. Feeling rejected, Ephialtes personally appeals to Xerxes, who promises a wealth of power, money, and pleasure in exchange for loyalty. This scene takes place in Xerxes' den, in which a throng of misshapen creatures engages in an orgy. Before ""300,"" I never would have believed that any film could include such a scene, or at least a scene that would work in any way, shape, or form. I was wrong; it was a fascinating scene, forcing the viewer to reassess what is beautiful and what is ugly.The film is narrated by Dilios (David Wenham), a Spartan soldier with a hard-edged masculinity that shines through despite a deceptively soft voice. He recalls Leonidas, Sparta, and the Battle of Thermopylae with eloquence; when considering the heavy-handedness of war, this is no small task. Yet he always gives a perfect delivery, and that only strengthens the appeal of ""300."" This is in a world all its own, a world dominated by battle cries, sword fights, and bare-chested men that are ripped like bodybuilders. It's all thanks to Frank Miller, whose creative vision has allowed for a truly unique theatrical experience. If he creates another graphic novel, I can't wait for it to be adapted for the big screen."	5.0	I Am Spartan! Hear Me Roar!	2007-03-09	200	157	43

It's not a movie set in the real world, but rather set in a world full of exaggerations. It's about these highly exaggerated men, and their highly exaggerated enemies.

The diaglogue is workman-like, though with occasional nods to Herodotus. The acting is pretty damn fine (as are a few of the Spartans). The movie isn't great social commentary on East vs West (despite what the government of Iran might have you think).This is a film about war, about violence and in many ways about beauty.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3I7EHVQ4AAKFV	"Christina ""Lisa"""	"300 has the trappings of Greek history as understood by adolescent minds, but let's hope someone makes a better movie closer to the more interesting facts left out of this script. I am not crazy about how it skirts the idea of social engineering through infanticide, slavery, forced homosexuality among the men and the interesting life women had to lead.  I have no interest in reading the graphic novel probably because of these oversights, especially since so many good histories and drama have been written about this over the centuries.I like seeing where movies and the actors in them go.  More accurately this is an illustrated fable that is carefully staged and aims at our gut senses.  At a time when freedom feels threatened and so few are keeping their reason and trying to come forward to nurture it, it speaks for our time (going to war with too few troops - sound familiar?) rather than reflecting what really happened. I find the depiction of the eastern and southern people of the other hemisphere as being so exotic and deformed too cartoonish, worthy of very old cartoon racism from newspapers long gone.The cast is really good.  Most of the actors, save those made up to look otherwise, who play the Greeks, are really attractive. (I am going to be dreaming of Gerard Butler and some of the other Spartans for a while. Lena Headley has been acting since she was a girl.  She has always taken on interesting projects.)  The choreography and blocking are dramatic. Watch this for entertainment.For a good history closer to the truth, check out the BBC documentary, ""The Spartans"", narrated and written by Bettany Hughes.  She explains Thermopylae by walking us through the sites of history and presenting a much more complicated story of Sparta and the recognized world then. She doesn't need special photography or squibs to illustrate the violence and harsh life.  She does use cheese though.  (You have to watch to find out.)As a very contrived story very loosely following the truth, I liked this movie because it is a little interesting.  The director's commentary is adequate and not really enlightening."	3.0	The actors and art design make this movie. The rest is comic shlock - history imagined by adolescent minds.	2007-08-12	9	4	5
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AEWTHNQNGUMRG	Christina Yau	The picture quality of the movie itself is amazing.  There is a very perceivable difference between the SD special features and the HD movie.  People say the picture is grainy, but it's because the enviroment calls for dust or ash or embers.  If there's one complaint, it is that the contrast seems a little harsher than the DVD which I also have.  There are much darker shadows covering more of people's faces, and there are scenes in the sun where the color looks a bit off (compared to the soft yellow-ish hue from the DVD).  I love the movie, and overall, I'm happy with my purchase.	4.0	Good picture quality	2007-11-16	0	0	0

But the point is to entertain, and yet even as Frank Miller twists it as he does, he still does an amazing job depicting it already. If you don't like, then don't complain, its your opinion, you should have watched the preview. Its an amazing movie, and still depicts the truth.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1OB5L3WMHJAD9	Christopher Culver	"300, the 2007 story of the three hundred Spartans who held off a massive Persian offensive in Ancient Greece, proved a disappointing film. In spite of my Classics degree, I won't complain about the divergences from recorded fact. The film is clearly meant to be a fantasy on historical themes instead of a faithful account of the event. Rather, what irked me was the hammy dialogue. There were the tropes of recent Hollywood battle scenes: warriors on the good guys' side defending themselves with little exertion as they trade silly quips about how they've got each other's backs. A queen gives an address to a council that is all melodrama -- are we back in George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" prequels?Being a fan of SIN CITY, I thought this would be enjoyable on the basis of its special effects, but alas it wasn't. For one, the cinematography is claustrophobic. All outdoor scenes but one were filmed with a green screen, and the digital backdrops add no depth. Even when supposedly standing on the Greek coast under a big sky, everyone seems like they are just standing around in a fairly small room. Also, the fight scenes seem more primitive than THE MATRIX RELOADED of a few years prior.The little I can recommend 300 for is the variety of demonic monsters and exotic constumed assassins that fill the Persian army. As I said, this is a fantasy on historical themes, and the additions are often interesting. Still, I had a hard time sitting through the whole film."	2.0	An occasionally intriguing fantasy undone by cliche after cliche	2010-06-27	4	1	3
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1A89LQ8C1AYV1	Christopher Deweese	My review will not only comment on the quality of the movie and blu-ray format it's contained in, but it will also comment on the perception by some that the movie is anti-Iranian.This is a fun movie to watch.  It is not an historically accurate depiction of the battle at Thermopylae.  Frank Miller himself admits that he likes to be inaccurate if he can.  The movie is over the top, dramatic, outlandish, and visually stunning.  It's just like a comic book, which it is based on.  I never went into the theater hoping for an historical epic.  I wanted to see crazy Spartans shouting and fighting.  Luckily, this movie delivers.  It's simply fun to watch.The blu-ray disc is generally good.  I did see some grainy images from time to time, but I think that might have been a result of the CGI and assorted filters the film makers added rather than the disc format.  The clearest, most detailed blu-ray movie I've ever seen is still Corpse Bride.  Nothing even compares to that.  However, if you want to see 300 in all its glory, see it in 1080p on your big screen LCD.  That's the way to go.I was surprised to hear about the controversy surrounding this film, specifically from Iran who deemed it offensive.  Of course, they've banned the movie.  I consider myself a pretty free-thinking, moderate joe, but I have to say that the Iranians need to take a chill pill.  You didn't hear the English complaining about how offensive Braveheart was.  That film was the most anti-English film I've ever seen.  You don't hear about Germany complaining about all the WWII movies and video games out there that depict Germans as evil.The reason for that is because those movies concentrate on the themes of freedom and fighting for what you believe in.  300 didn't really focus on the fact that it was Persians who were invading.  The movie didn't ridicule the Persians for being who they were.  The movie ridiculed them for being usurpers and destroyers (not for being Persians).  There are plenty of movies out there that ridicule the U.S. for doing the same thing, but we don't ban movies for that.  American movies make fun of Canadians, French, English, Australians, etc., but you don't hear about those countries banning our movies.  Sheesh!Anyway, now that I'm done with my soap box issue, I still have to recommend the movie/blu-ray disc.  Personally, I like the blu-ray format.  I don't need to see the blue screen picture in picture version that comes with the HD DVD.  The extras that came with the blu-ray version were plenty for me.  If you want a good action movie, get it.  Nuff said.	4.0	Just My Opinion...And Nothing More.	2007-08-23	0	0	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2W6945IO9008U	Christopher Hart	The movie was amazing.  Unfortunately the Blu-Ray was NOT.  My DVD version of 300 looks 10 times better than this garbage which is no exaggeration.  The moment I received it in the mail I popped it into my not yet one month old blu-ray replacement player and was overly disappointed.  If it weren't for the fact that I'd have to pay return shipping I'd send it back and tell them to give it to their dog as a chew-toy.  It just isn't worth purchasing so go ahead and get the regular DVD which has the better picture.  I've noticed that the BR of 300 was incorporated with the grainy/nastiness and if this is the case it was an epic fail.  Other than the quality of the disk the movie itself was awesome but then again Gerard Butler is a spectacular actor and I've loved nearly all of his movies.	1.0	Great Movie!

I was originally going to get it on regular DVD, but then about a week before it came out, I got a PS3.So i decided to spend the extra 5 or 6 bucks on it, and get it on blu-ray. I am so glad that I did because the special effects are so smooth and blend in more with the movie. It is a great movie and is even better on blu-ray. So just spend the extra 6 bucks and get more than the regular DVD option has to offer.	5.0	great movie and better on blu-ray	2007-08-12	4	4	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1IOYGSABP4C8C	"C. Jess ""Christoph3D"""	FIRST OFF: before you read any of the other reviews, please let's clear up a few facts.1. This movie is based on a graphic novel. The extreme colors and strong graphic visuals are in many cases very much based on exact pages from the book.2. This movie was NEVER supposed to be historically accurate. Again, it is based on a graphic novel, itself *very* loosely based on the Battle of Thermopylae, but that's about it.3. The novel was released in 1998, 3 years before the most recent film adaptation of Lord of the Rings, so please spare me any direct comparisons.I give this review 4 stars based on the fact that the DVD is not actually out yet so I can't really comment on it. The movie itself was one of the most amazing adaptations of a graphic novel I have seen to date. Read the book then watch the movie, the way certain shots are matched are amazing. Sure there are a lot of scenes that could have been handled differently, but this is still a Hollywood action movie - if you want historical accurracy (nothing wrong with that) go watch the History Chanel.	4.0	amazing adaption	2007-07-05	4	3	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A231ZCJGWZA38A	"Claude Bouchard ""Eurodancemix"""	"Not being familiar with the Frank Miller ""graphic novel"" (which is really a fancy term for ""expensive comic book""), I approached this story with a clean slate and an open mind. I had nothing to compare it to and I had no expectations...other than, hopefully, I hadn't wasted $5 on a matin&eacute;e.I am impressed and awed. This movie managed to cover all the bases: storytelling, atmosphere, special effects, violence, greed, betrayal, love, sex and enough man-candy to fuel many masturbatory fantasies for both men and women alike. Six-pack abs and leather jocks abound, amongst other things. To say that this movie is ""gay"" is definitely not an insult...a gay sensibility runs throughout, from costume design to sly cultural Greek references to each and every frame that brims with details and textures. This is one gorgeous movie!However, don't be fooled...this is also one heck of an ultra-violent flick. It is, after all, a battle story. But this is not sadistic ""Saw""-type violence; rather, it is presented in a mythical and, dare I even say it this way, poetic fashion. Full-out war has never been this lyrical! The action scenes are intense and beautiful. Many are rendered in slow-motion and one can fully appreciate the quasi-ballet that unfolds. This is comic book art come to life: the intense stares, the posturing, the clever funny quips, the flowing capes, the blood that splatters in gobs (the ""Mortal Kombat"" video game of the early 90's was apparently more influential than previously thought), the severed heads that quietly slip off torsos, the behemoth creatures, the grotesque characters and the decadent opulence of the enemy.This is one film that would not have disappointed me even if I had paid full price. Granted this will probably not have terrific audiences because it is so graphic and it does originate from a comic book (""The Incredible Hulk"" undoubtedly still lingers in many moviegoers' minds, I'm sure). But I envision a rabid and devout cult following for this one. I can't say I'll be one of them but I'll certainly do my share: the DVD will be purchased when it's released."	5.0	Eye-Candy *AND* A Great Story	2007-03-12	6	3	3

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A5LYQZ3A4ZUQX	Clear Thinker	"You may have noted that the movie ""300!"" is clobbering all competitors at the box office, seen varying reviews, and wondered if it was worth it. In a word, absolutely!The plot is true, and well-known. In the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC an alliance of Greek city-states fought the invading Persian army in the mountain pass of Thermopylae. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King Xerxes led an Army of well over 300,000 men to Greece and was confronted by King Leonidas of Sparta and 300 Spartans (plus some Athenians). He offers them terms/promises/bribes to stand aside and join his empire, and they choose to fight, knowing they will all die, while the folks back home debate about whether to send reinforcements..Thar's the bare bones of it, but doesn't cover the truly glorious film that is 300! The photography, enhanced by computer graphics, is shockingly beautiful. The dialogue and acting is terrific. Gerard Butler's King Leonidas makes Russell Crowe's Maximus (Gladiator) look like a choir boy in comparison. Can't see how you could do better short of Richard Burton. There is an excellent extensive female part, and it would be a mistake to think of this as just a ""guy's' movie"". There is even some definite humor. My wife loved it. You WILL be drawn in and emotionally involved. Quite a few audiences seem to applaud at the end. They should.You may have heard this is violent. Well,sort of. It is a genuine epic with many fight scenes. The film editor never uses the same camera angle twice, and the combination of color and shading makes for an absolute beautiful vision. Much thought had also been put into the music, and sound effects chosen by the director. But there really is little blood and no spilled innards, though there are antiseptic severed limbs and heads.You may have heard that this is a ""political'"" movie, and it is true the the Iranians are not fond of it. I didn't see it that way. Greece WAS the foundation of Democracy and Western Civilization, and the invading army WAS Persian. Can't change reality.In sum, the movie really is the words that are over-used. Spectacular. Epic. Glorious. Beautiful. Heroic.Five stars. For sure. Go see it. And don't wait for the DVD."	5.0	300!

I own several blu-ray movies and this one has the worst quality out of all of them. The image seems poor and small circles that make up the images are visible.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Last time I saw a film that had massive hype from the internet people was Snakes on a Plane, the Samuel L. Jackson vehicle that turned out to be nothing more than a decent way to have some entertainment for an hour and a half. But in 300's case, it wants to be entertaining yet have depth and emotion and pathos too. Problem is everything kind of lessens it since it's made in a videogame-like manner where its attempts at anything deeper is surrounded by fast visuals and graphic violence. Now some will probably disagree of course but personally, I wasn't a big fan of this.Set in the time of Ancient Greek, King Leonidas of Sparta has been informed that King Xerxes of Persia wants to take over Sparta and expand his rule. Of course Leonidas doesn't take kindly to this and against orders and without a proper army, takes 300 of his best soldiers to fight against the coming Persian army. Meanwhile back home, his wife Queen Gorgo tries to persuade the council to send the army to help while dealing with a conniving man back home.When I first saw this in theatres, I had to admit that I was quite impressed with the look of the visuals. Shot on a digital set where the backgrounds are replaced with CG, I thought the film had a great look. Unfortunately what it does with it I started to hate since much of the film uses slow motion to make things more ""cooler"" rather than use it sparingly and heighten the action. This is combined with the film's want to be epic and grand on the level of sand-and-sandal epics like Gladiator where orchestrated music plays in the background and characters stare at each other. Some might prefer this to just simply having fight scene after fight scene a la Black Hawk Down but it felt false to me.As far as the acting, it's kind of appropriate. Characters say lines with words like ""honor"" and ""victory"" a lot, look cool and fight while showing off their muscle-y bodies. The one leading this is Gerard Butler and on 2nd viewing I liked him more when before he seemed like an action figure that's skilled in battle and yelled a lot. But this film wasn't meant to win awards but at least Butler does an admirable job. The other 2 I liked were David Whenham (who funnily enough is better at war speeches than Butler) and Michael Fassbender, otherwise known as the ""and we will fight in the shade"" guy.Granted there is some great visuals here including a nice love scene, an oracle dancing to puffs of smoke and the landscapes of Greece but everything else I wasn't a big fan of. If you want to have MTV-style entertainment and outlandish cartoon violence then go that way like Snakes did but combining Lord of the Rings emotions didn't help. Disagree all you want but for me this is a film that wants to be more than what it is."	3.0	Unleash your inner 14 year old	2007-07-24	3	1	2

This is not one of them.  As far as the movie goes, it is an absolutely awseome action packed film.

OKeefe ""1337"""	"First and foremost, to anyone reading this review as a means to decide whether or not they'd like to buy/see this movie, let me say this:This film is not historical. Though some historical elements are present, it is based off of a comic book that is a fictional rendition of the Battle of Thermopylae. If you go into watching it with that in mind, it will be much more enjoyable.Ultimately, this movie was about hope and glory against all odds. The story itself was wonderful and beautifully done as well. I have to admit that before seeing this film I was quite skeptical of it. Worrying that it would be ""just another action flick"" but I was so amazed and happy with it afterwards.This is one of the most artistically wonderful movies I have seen in a long time. It is, indeed, based off off the Battle of Thermopylae, which is marvelous. But I loved the fictional elements very much. The movie was almost dream-like in appearance and the addition of various creatures and deformed humans just added to that quality. This movie was absolutely beautiful and stylistic. Some people have called it a horror film due to the blood.... Yes, it's a bit gory... but not in the ""scare the crap out of you so that you'll have nightmares"" kind of way that real horror films do. It's about a battle, so of course there is bloodshed and death. I do think it was quite smart though that, in some places, the visual style of the film actually hid some gruesome stuff in the shadows so that you couldn't see it.I heartily recommend this film to anyone looking for something original and visually amazing."	5.0	Wonderful Movie	2007-11-12	1	0	1

Once I shut my brain off, this was a great movie to watch.  Full of cheesy lines to pump soldiers up and get testosterone flowing, action and fighting scenes paralleled to none this past year.  I actually took a nap during the first 20 minutes, but once the 300 marched, I was watching intently.  This movie is very gory, and should not under any circumstances be viewed by young kids, but for adults, and the target audience of men ages 18-30, this will likely meet the quota of action you may need for a week or two.  Check this out, worth renting, caution on buying.  This is no gladiator, but worth a look.	4.0	Shut off the brain and watch the action	2007-08-07	1	1	0
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3AQDK1F0YQKAS	"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado"""	Finally saw it last night after anxiously awaiting its arrival for well over a year and I came away from the film being somewhat impressed by certain features of the film, but by no means is this one of the greatest films ever made since it leaves much to be desired.Acting wise '300' works, if only slightly above average. The cast is actually well chosen in terms of having the right look as the men are very muscular, much in the same way one imagines the Spartans were. The women were the classic beauties but felt like not much more than window dressing, except for the queen, King Leonidas' wife. She's the only one who had any kind of meaningful presence in the story. Sadly, despite the acting chops of everyone involved, they were limited by the cookie cutter dialogue. The dialogue wasn't stilted, but nevertheless it wasn't something that hadn't been seen a thousand times before and for that it left a gap by those wishing to gain a little more insight into these brave characters.One thing that kind of puzzles me is that with the precedent set by Gibson in 'The Passion of the Christ' in which the actors speak Aramaic and Latin, and in his latest 'Apocolypto' the actors speak Mayan, so why not have Greek actors speak their native tongue? Or at the very least incorporate some Greek phrases or words into the dialogue, that would've added to the feel of their culture.  Of course this missing feature does not detract from the film's value but it would certainly have been a substantial contribution to the essence of the film.Aesthetically speaking, the movie is a masterpiece. Many of the scenes were quite breathtaking and looked incredibly realistic, and I say this because everyone may not know that the entire film was shot in front of a blue/green screen, so all the nature shots and sweeping cinematography of various architecture was all digitally animated or super-imposed. Many of the monsters, leppers and hunchbacks were digitally enhanced as well, some were completely done by CGI, and it's easy to tell. There's much to be said for the strengths of CGI in this day and age, but I still have a major problem with it being the backbone of a film's environment and atmosphere, since there's that part of my subconscious that's telling me it's not real and that kind of ruins the plausability of the context. The wolf scene, which was pivotal as foreshadowing, is a prime example of this. A real wolf would have been far more convincing and the impact of the scene would have been much more poignant if this were the case. There are other instances of this, but because of the nature and importance of this one in particular it really stands out in a not so positive way.As for romance, there wasn't really much as there was gratuitous sex, which I didn't mind per se, but it did nothing for the story and for any epic tale there has to be true love and sadly the little that was there was superficial.Story wise it was very straightforward. There was no beating around the bush about who the Spartans were, what they were capable of and what their intentions were, so at least the exposition was effective. There were a fair amount of plot devices but they were rather cliche' and despite the ultimate outcome of the battle as most movie goers probably knew beforehand, much of the secondary plot was so elementary that it was too predictable. The plot behind the scenes of Spartan politics could have elevated the film to a more serious status, but it felt tacked on and honestly it could have been cut out of the film and it would have felt no different. Essentially it served as an excuse to give the main plot a pause, to slow it down a bit because of the intense nature of the battles, so for the sake of pacing, which is important in any film, it worked, but it added little depth to the overall story. The sub-plot definitely needed some fleshing out for it to be truly effective on its own.Now for the action itself. The fighting choreography was excellent, no doubt about it. It's not the best I've seen, but it was certainly thrilling, shocking and gruesome, notably some viscious encounters with freaks from the Persian army. There were a few moments were the fighting was incredibly intense, but throughout the film I wish there had been more of a focus on the actual battle formations and strategy employed, since it was not strictly their fighting prowess that made them legendary but also their brilliant tactics.The interpretation of King Xerxes was unusual, granted it's based on a graphic novel that was inspired by the historical battle, but it worked. It didn't feel entirely original though, since it seemed to borrow heavily from the sci-fi flick 'Stargate' in which an ancient Egyptican god was somewhat androgenous with a contrasting deep, booming voice surrounded by numerous slaves. The look, feel, makeup, jewelry and voice was more than reminiscent of that.Throughout the film the score was relevant, helping to accentuate certain moods and themes, and at times it was completely captivating. The mix of more modern rock music during battles was appropriate while the more classical compositions better suited the moments of silence or reflection of a scene's message.It bears mentioning to point out the freaks and monsters that permeated this film, which added an air of mystery to the events, but with the same token it was kind of distracting since those instances felt so out of place. Of course this goes back to the film being based on a graphic novel which tends to be more liberal with its interpretations than films are, traditionally, but nevertheless it didn't quite work as it should, perhaps this is just my personal preference. Artistically it was intriguing, but as far as making the film any better I'd have to say no.Despite all of it being CGI, the cinematography was of high caliber. A very grand scale was at the heart of the technique and I must say it is impressive how far the technology has come. Some real world locations though would have been even more fascinating. If it would have been filmed in Greece itself, that would definitely have given the film more legitimacy and believability.On the topic of cinematography, the color scheme was too monochromatic, although it was an interesting experimentation with variations of a few key hues such as gold and grey. This again falls back to adapting a graphic novel to the silver screen and I'm pleased to see Hollywood step outside of its comfort zone.All elements considered, this film feels more like an epic poem and the execution was poetry in motion, words put to very fluid action and a rapid, almost non-stop pace, but it's the kind of poem that lacks profoundness and does not challenge the intellectual side of us. Instead, it appeals to our sense of beauty, and not just the traditional form of it, but the beauty that can be found in the grotesque as well as the flawless. Essentially '300' was deeper and more unique than the average war film, particularly with its avant garde visuals and special effects, but nevertheless it fails to break the upper echelon of war epics, such as the likes of 'Braveheart' and 'Gladiator'.On a scale of 1-5, I'd have to say 3.9. For me it's not the kind of film I will see again and again, but it's definitely worth watching at least once.	4.0	'300' Stays True To Its Counterpart's Poetic Nature	2007-04-10	18	11	7
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A28LZQ5NX7TD0R	Coolfield	"Disclaimer: This is a layman review. I'm not a professional movie critic; this is a common sense review.Just to give you some background, 300 is set around the Battle of Thermopylae. Long story short, Persians invade Greece, Spartans vs Persians blah blah blah.This movie looks more like propaganda than an actual movie aimed at making the Persians the big bad wolf and the Spartans, the saints just trying to protect their homeland.Problem is the movie has a very twisted atmosphere. The Spartans are dressed up in plain, red leather underwear with capes. Extremely stupid! Who the hell goes into battle wearing their undies? They went into battle wearing full body armor not under garments. Oh and also, they have painted-on abs. The movie demonizes the Persians; it makes the Persians into monsters which they were not in real life. The Immortal soldiers have these frowning masks on, the average Persian soldier is a bad person, etc.  Many of the Persians, like Xerxes, and the messengers, are portrayed as African. Persians are NOT African. They were Aryans. Look at modern day Iranians, they're quite white, not black.This movie is aimed at stoking anti-Persian sentiments. I'm not taking sides here, both sides have been portrayed stupidly and the people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves.The whole movie is set on a green screen. All the scenery, other than the few houses, are on the green screen. Giving a fake and digital look. The atmosphere is the typical, stereotyped one. Greeks with their robes and Persians with head wraps and colorful clothing. Most of the fight scenes are more of a dance than a battle. They've made this historic battle into some sort of weirdo dance.This movie is aimed at the masses who like these stupid, stereotypical movies, with blood and guts flying over the screen for no reason. Know what I'm talking about? It's that type of ""man"" movie. I like historic movies like A Bridge Too Far, which is awesome, but this is a fake.I would really recommend watching ""The True History about 300 the Movie"" by the History Channel. It shows what the Spartans and Persian were actually like. It tells the whole story and not just the battle; there was a reason why the Persians invaded Greece. Even better the whole program is on YouTube for free. Here's the link: [...] It's a bit low quality on YouTube because it wasn't recorded very well but there are more programs by the History Channel about the battle in the side bar. Anything is better than this pile of garbage.A movie I do recommend is Meet the Spartans. It's a parody of this movie. Very very funny.Overall this ""movie"" is just propaganda and is a waste of money and time."	1.0	Utter Stupidity	2013-12-10	9	1	8

Using computer enhancement and super slo-mo director Zack Snyder accentuates the blood and gore of the fabled Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C.Scotsman Gerard Butler who cuts an authoritative figure as the buffed Spartan king Leonidas, is coaxed into battle defending his homeland from the vast invading Persian hoardes.  Led by Xerxes played by a pierced, bejeweled Rodrigo Santoro, complete with plucked eyebrows, the Persian demi-god fails to understand the mindset of the militaristic Spartans.  Groomed for combat from birth, the Spartan does not know the meaning of surrender.Leonidas sacrifices a group of 300 soldiers who will allow the million plus Persian troops to funnel through a narrow seaside pass to be slaughtered by the superior fighting Spartans.The computer graphics and the dizzying battle scenes are breathtaking only to be somewhat reigned in by scenes of the politicking led by Queen Gorgo, played by Lena Headey, back home in Sparta.  It seems that Leonidas lead his troops into battle against the advice of their oracle and against the wishes of the ruling council.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	"WARNING: This film contains brutal, graphic, stylized action/violence, sexuality/partial nudity, and fascist ideologies.Based upon Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name,300is the bloody story of King Leonidas who lead three hundred of his bravest Spartan warriors into battle against overwhelming odds. The film is an impressive exercise in the use of CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) and was made on a relatively small budget. Technically the film is an extraordinary achievement but artistically it's somewhat lacking. This is due in part to the story itself, which oversimplifies a massively complex historical period and is also due to the inaccuracies presented as though they were obvious to every viewer. I don't think that your average ""action film audience"" member is familiar with ancient military or political histories, nor do I think that all viewers will understand the social implications that this film makes. Frank Miller himself has pointed out the liberties he's taken with history and makes no excuses, saying, ""I've never been accused of realism and I never deserve to be.""It would be silly of me to accuse the film or the graphic novel of being an unrealistic or inappropriate portrait of the battle of Thermopylae, so I won't focus on the many deviations from reality. Rather, my reason for having mixed feelings about the film comes from the fact that it is so clearly a pro-war film. There's much emphasis on the necessity of war and the glory of dying in battle, which considering current events seems like a strange and potentially dangerous statement to be making, especially when the events the differences between the Persian invasion and the Iraq war are so obvious. If a comparison is to be made there are certain things that must be taken into account. There are many differences between the last stand at Thermopylae (480 B.C.) and the U.S./Iraq  conflict.1. First of all, there have been phenomenal technological advances in which we have the advantage. If Greece is to be viewed as an allegory for the U.S., one must also consider the fact that we are technologically better equipped than the opposing forces in modern Iraq. In ancient Greece, though they were making revolutionary technological progress, the Persians would have had the advantage mainly because their empire was so vast that they had control over some of the most creative and innovative minds.2. We outnumber the Iraqi insurgents whereas Leonidas and the Greeks were in the minority back then. While the Persians were creating an empire by conquering one nation after another and amassing an enormous army, the threat that we face is significantly smaller in number. In fact they are the underdogs, which if the theory is correct could mean that one day religious and political terrorists will be looked upon with the same sense of romanticism as piracy in the Caribbean and slavery in the Southern United States. This is something that is truly frightening.3. Though Leonidas and the Spartans are given much of the praise for the ultimate defeat of the Persians, it was in actuality the Greek navy who was responsible for their victory (the battle of Thermopylae was in essence a sideshow, the real decisive battles were the battles of Salamis and Plataea). This is in direct contrast with today where the government is either praised or blamed for the accomplishments and foibles in Iraq. Today the soldier is often forgotten or vilified while politicians bask in the spotlight.The story is very straight forward as it follows he-man King Leonidas, who foresees Persia's imminent invasion of Greece and tells of his attempt to stop it. King Leonidas, like all male Spartans, was sent to the agoge (a brutal school where young boys are trained to become soldiers or die trying), where at the age of seven he began military training of the highest caliber. Upon his return he is crowned king and he becomes a popular yet controversial leader. Years later, when Persian messengers come to offer Leonidas to align himself with the ""God-King"", Xerxes, Leonidas slaughters the messengers and essentially brings the wrath of the Persian Empire upon his people (this is a dramatic departure from the historical truth). The Spartan political world is greatly dependent on religious ritualism, so Leonidas goes to the fabled city of Delphi to see the Oracle (a prophet and priestess). There it becomes apparent that the Oracle is being manipulated by other priests and that they are in league with Xerxes. He is told that he is forbidden to go to war and Leonidas realizes that if Greece is to survive in its present form then he must take the western world's fate into his own hands. He gathers three hundred of his greatest soldiers and they march to Thermopylae (translates to the Hot Gates), an enclosed area off the shoreline and the most readily accessible access to Greece. When the Persians arrive they battle it out with the Spartans (in reality there were also hundreds of other Greeks present, not just the three hundred Spartans), hacking off limbs, shattering bones and basically committing one savage act of violence after another. At first the Spartans hold their ground but the sheer number of their opponents (historical documents vary; some say that the Persian army that fought at Thermopylae was only six thousand strong while other say that there was an astounding million) proves to be their downfall. However their deaths inspire Greece to go to war where Persia is finally defeated at Plataea.Another reason for the film's controversy is that the story appears to be a celebration of fascism. The Greeks are viewed as being muscular, heroic, Herculean figures of honor and duty, but the Persian army (which consist of Asian, African and Middle-eastern warriors) is portrayed as being sadistic, dominating, sexually perverse and dishonest. There's a great deal of racial and cultural stereotyping which will undoubtedly offend some viewers. There's also a strong homophobic atmosphere (much like the works of Nietzsche). The muscular Spartans refer to the intellectual Athenians as being ""philosophers and boy-lovers"", which may be true in some sense. In ancient Greece, homosexuality was common and it didn't have the social stigma that it carried after the rise of Judeo-Christian values.It's also unfortunate that the filmmakers have attempted to make ancient Spartan society a parable for the United States. If this is what we are to become, what our modern society is born of, if these are the values that we embrace then the future is indeed bleak.Yet with all of these things in mind I can still recommend 300. For one it's a fascinating reflection of our current moral attitudes and our disturbing fascination with violence. It's also a reminder of the perils of extremist viewpoints and social hypocrisy. The film is really only enjoyable if viewed as mindless pulp entertainment, but it's thoroughly depressing when viewed as an allegory.Also recommended for those interested in learning about the historical events that inspired this film:The HistoriesRepublicThermopylae: The Battle For The WestThermopylae 480 BC: Last stand of the 300The History Channel Presents Last Stand of the 300 - The Legendary Battle at ThermopylaeThe 300 Spartans"	3.0	Bronze, Brawn and Blood!	2008-08-13	2	2	0

National film critics weren't kind to it, but the public liked it. That's usually a good sign and it was in this case.  The movie is not only entertaining, it's one of the all-time great visual treats.On Blu-Ray, it looks even more magnificent. It is just  stunning to look at from start-to-finish, on a regular DVD, too. That's what held my attention. Sure, I could tell the obvious computer-generated effects, but so what? This movie simply was fun to ogle, with all it's incredible scenery, outrageous monster-like characters and dramatic colors.As for the story, I head read ""it's just moronic mayhem, nothing but blood and guts and way overdone action.""Not really.I've seen a number of films with a lot more action than in here. When they did have it, unlike a lot of other films, the carnage didn't go on and on. It lasted a few minutes at most and broke for a lull.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"Those expecting an historical treatment of the Spartans at Thermopylae will be lost or frustrated or angry at this treatment.  It comes from a graphic novel (comic book) dramatization using the story as a base.  A few of the elements in this telling do have an historical basis.  But not much.Is it a fun movie?  Well, it is tremendously bloody.  I am not a slasher movie fan, so I have not a clue how it ranks on the Red-Rain-O-Meter of popular culture, but it is easily the bloodiest thing I have scene beyond the first 30 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"",  but here - it is for the entire movie.  Here when blood isn't spurting and limbs aren't flying it is the exception.Some have complained that the movie doesn't capture how harsh the Spartan culture really was, and that is true.  The story does not show the huge numbers of slaves kept by the Spartans, and it does imply that Spartan husbands and wives lived together as we do today in America.  Think barracks and you will be closer to the truth.Along with the blood and the nearly naked men running around in capes and leather briefs, we do get three scenes with nudity and two of those are sex scenes.  There is also an extended scene of creepiness inside Xerxes' tent of pleasure.  However, there is much tougher stuff in the movie.  This isn't for kids.  Still I enjoyed Queen Gogor's treatment of Theron at the council.  It is quite satisfying and not overdone.  If more of the movie had been along these lines I would have appreciated it even more.  (Theron is a fiction, by the way.)While some have complained about the nine-foot Xerxes, the outsized Rhino, the scene with elephants about the size of those in Lord of the Rings, and the monster wolf, I understand that the story is going after telling the tale in a way that would seem as odd and miraculous as the telling might have been in ancient Sparta.  They did not and were not going for any kind of objective realism and such animals would have seemed spectacularly odd to them.  Xerxes with his vast army would have seemed much larger and different than anything they had ever seen before.Still, in the end, this is NOT a serious treatment of the events at Thermopylae.  It is a bloody film that is fun to watch if you are in for that sort of thing.  It has some amazing effects.  I kind of enjoyed its lack of realism.  All of the characters and their settings to look like a graphic novel or bloody video game come to the big screen.This isn't a bad movie, but its hyper violence left me cold.  The fighting is unrealistic, but dramatic.  It is amazing that a few thousand Greeks (not just 300) held off the vast army of Xerxes for even three days.  That is an inspiring story and to the extent that is here, the movie works very well for me.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2LPZI0YMSV6EE	C-Smooth	"Well, I reviewed '300: Rise of an Empire' and figured I might as well give the first film a brief review as well.300 stars Gerald Butler as King Leonidas of Sparta, Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo of Sparta, David Wenham as Dillios of Sparta who also narrates the movie, and Rodrigo Santoro as King Xerxes of Persia.This film is fictionalized but based upon the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC which was part of the Persian Wars. Quoting King Leonidas from the film while he is speaking with Xerxes, ""the world will know free men stood against a tyrant, that few stood against many, and before this battle was over, even a God-King can bleed."" And that is essentially what 300 is it's a story of how few stood against many and were willing to fight till the death for what they believed in.As the movie begins it is narrated by Dillios who describes what life was like as a spartan boy and their trials of becoming a man. The child shown was a young Leonidas and it later continues on to him being crowned King of Sparta. Persian messengers are sent to Sparta to deliver a message from Xerxes demanding that Sparta surrender to him and his empire. Well, that didn't go quite to plan for the messengers as Leonidas didn't take kindly to this threat. Which leads to Leonidas to shout the popular quote, ""THIS IS SPARTA!"" and then him and his soldiers kick the messengers down a seemingly never ending water well. Now that the Persian invasion is imminent, Leonidas seeks advice from the Oracle. The Ephors consult with the Oracle and decide Sparta should not go to war with Persia. And, well, that doesn't exactly go as planned either as King Leonidas has already made up his mind. So he returns to Sparta and gathers up 300 of his best soldiers and heads towards the Hot Gates where he plans on using the mountainous terrain to funnel the Persians into them. Along the way a thousand or so Arcadians and Thebans join up with them.300 shows betrayal, courage, honor, brotherhood, and bravery. With odds favoring the Persians heavily and death is almost certain, King Leonidas and his brave 300 stand their ground willing to give their lives for what they believe in. Leonidas and his 300 Spartans attempt to hold off the Persian invasion for as long as possible to allow the Greek city states to unite. And when all was said and done Leonidas honored his word and proved that even a God-King can bleed.I'm rating this movie a 5/5 the CGI and visuals really were ground breaking and something completely new for it's time (2007). And the cast was very good Gerald Butler, Rodrigo Santoro, and Lena Headey were excellent. And the narration by David Wenham was exceptional. There are monumental fight scenes and plenty of memorable quotes. While watching this movie expect to see some over the top unrealistic stuff, 6 pack abs, lots of limbs flying through the air, blood spewing across the screen, nudity, a sex scene, gore and slow motion fight scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes an action packed movie with great visual effects."	5.0	Spartans! Prepare for glory...	2014-06-01	0	0	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AL9HZLZT4X1KL	CV Rick	Frank Miller's graphic novel come to life on the big screen doesn't live up to the promise of Sin City.The art direction is phenomenal and the Spartans, led by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), are imposing physical specimens of perfection - ripped abs, blazing scars, and piercing eyes.  The scenes where the Spartans line up like models at a fitness photo shoot are imposing.  The scenes of brilliantly choreographed combat are equally memorable, filling the screen with beautiful brutality, and images of desperate courage.  It looked like the living comic book of a heroic tale when viewed without the story and when viewed in absence of the on-screen caricatures of the Persian Army.That's where the problems begin.  Reality, in this case, is more amazing than fiction.  The movie pitted depravity against character by making modern moral judgments apply to ancient times.  It presupposes that homosexuality and gender confusion is such a feared 'condition' that the audience will side with the Spartans who are free of its taint.  When truth be told, the Spartans engaged in the deplorable acts of incest and pedophilia to an extent at least as great and perhaps greater than the Persians and that sexual identity wasn't part of the issues of battle during that time.  Frank Miller rewrote history to make a modern-day bigoted comment in a completely inappropriate manner.Why wouldn't the truth stand as banner to the bravery of the 300 of Thermopylae?  The truth that the Persians as invaders needed to be stopped and the Hot Gate, a small pass from the beach into Sparta was the best defensible position is dramatic enough. There is no doubt that King Leonidas undertook one of the most inspired, brilliant, and courageous last stands in the history of warfare.  There is no doubt that the Spartans were the most well-trained soldiers of the time.Knowing these truths there was no perceivable reason, other than propaganda, to politicize the war so much.  The council wasn't against Leonidas, the army hadn't stood down, the citizenry hadn't given up hope.  He delayed the bulk of Xerxes forces long enough for the rest of the army to assemble, get into position and fight against the invaders.  He stood his men in front of the juggernaut and laid down his and their lives for his people and his lands.  He led by example and died with honor, not backstabbed by councilmen with agendas filling some imaginary role substitution Miller created to make an anti-peace statement deriding our own present-day Congress.  The Persians were human and they didn't force any more slaves into their war than the Greeks conscripted on their own side.  The Persians weren't transgendered freaks and demons.  Dehumanization of one's enemy is a propagandist's trick, not used by great chroniclers of which Miller is not.The individual historical inaccuracies are many - too many for this short review.  The propaganda is thick and sickening, a movie made as a modern-day recruiting film, not a work of art or a worthy historical lesson, even dramatized as it could've been.The Art Director should be given royalties, but the director and writer ought to be fired.- CV Rick	3.0	A Caricature of Bravery	2007-04-01	12	5	7

Yu	"This is not a review of the movie or comparison between the hd-dvd or bluray version, but a review of the picture quality itself which is supposed to be in high definition. There are other reviews here saying the quality is superb, maybe the bluray I bought is actually a DVD version that was inadvertently labeled and packaged as bluray?I just bought the 300 movie in bluray format and it looks like DVD quality. I use my PS3 to watch bluray movies and this does not even come close to the other bluray movies that I have, and it pretty much looks like DVD quality. I have 5 bluray movies and it does not take an expert to distinguish from DVD and bluray.I feel like WB is cheating consumers by selling the bluray version of this movie, at bluray price, but in DVD quality.thanks to ""The Watcher"" for informing me about the ""grainy effect"" that this movie has, which has made me change my ""quality"" rating for picture quality to improve from 1 to 4 stars (for artistic effect, but i can't change/edit the rating i have put in). Here is his comment and my reply:THE WATCHER:""Dude, it was purposefully made grainy by the director to stay in tune with the way Frank Miller wants his graphic novels - gritty and hardcore. It was the same way in the theatres but no one really noticed because graininess is common in today's cinema. So it was the artistic vision of Frank Miller combined with the director that gave this film it's gritty, grimy look and feel.If you don't like the vision of the director and creator, you surely won't like Grindhouse because it had a lot more grain put in than this film did. I'd advise you to not buy that also.""MY REPLY:dude, i was not able to watch this in a theater house and this is the first time i have seen a movie by Frank Miller. i did not know that the ""grainy"" effect was purposely done to convey the artistic touch of the director. If that was the way the movie was intended to appear, then kudos to Frank as it is very evident in the movie. however, i did not have prior knowledge of this ""gritty and hardcore"" way that his movies are presented and being used to the picture quality i am expecting from high definition movies, i just stated my opinion on how the picture quality was, which you have also confirmed with your comment. i suppose fans of Frank who are familiar with his movies would not be surprised and will expect the quality that i stated in my review.IN ADDITION:I read comments that bluray does not have extra features compared to HD-DVD, but I found out that the bluray version HAS THE EXTRA FEATURES MENU AT THE END OF THE MOVIE.When you first put the disc in your player it will automatically play the movie from the start.

The picture is crisp and the art is as stunning as the movie appeared in theaters.  Sound also translates well to the dvd.  The extras, however, are what raises this dvd to a must-buy.  In depth interviews with the director, cast, author (Frank Miller) and most importantly, historians.  It is refreshing to see that the creators of the film clearly state that this work is not meant to be a historical presentation but a mythological one, an explanation that is well-clarified by the historians interviewed.  I could go on about the additional content concerning costume design, training, the soundtrack and the aesthetic visuals but that would ruin what awaits you on the dvd.  If you enjoyed 300 for what it was, a mythological re-telling of one of history's pivotal moments, then you should get this dvd.	5.0	Superb	2007-09-03	0	0	0

Granted, I don't mind guys running around in capes and underwear but that stupid golden haze over everything just made them look weird. The main thing I wondered while watching this movie was were the people making it high? Maybe I would've liked it more if I'd smoked some of what they had.I'm all for interesting cinematography and artistic visuals, and at times this film had some, but the whole movie was so pretentious and self-absorbed that the attempts at being cool were laughable at best. The worst part was the redundant *poetic narration*. Did anyone else catch that nearly everytime the narrator spoke he ended with something like ""And we will protect Sparta for every man, woman, child, infant, fetus, grandmother, grandfather, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, cousin, step-cousin, half-cousin, quarter-cousin, brother in law, sister in law...""

I know when I was little in the 80's it seemed like all the boys in the neighborhood would exercise their inner gayness by rushing inside to watch He-Man with its now obvious homo-erotic undertones, but He-Man at his raunchiest was never anything like 300!Man, it must've taken total courage to make an erotic gay film like this in Hollywood of the Bush era.

This is truly a classic, and if you don't see the message in it or in the least, feel something great from this film, then watch it until you do. :)Respectfully, to the reviewer who is making some kind of connection with homosexuality and Iran, I have got to say that you and others like you need to stop connecting these movies with reality and making something out of nothing. It's ridiculous.  And, to say that someone does not have something wrong with your feedback, but the movie, is simply saying you're offended by any disagreement. Well, too bad, this movie is a triumphant film and the last thing I have on my mind at the end of this movie is certainly not some mainstream, non-sensical political garbage of modern society like that.  If the director wanted to slide that into the film, which I know some do and it is shameful, then the majority are not going to even care nor notice about that aspect anyway.  However, some individuals like yourself feel the need to spread garbage and point things out that don't need to be fabricated or at the most, blown out of proportion.  Who cares if the Iranians say ""death to Americans"", that's them being stereotypical, and hopefully one day it will all be smoothed over, but for now, just take the movie(s) for what it is (they're) worth.

Todd ""InvictusX"""	"First off, if you're seeing this movie in the belief that it will be historically accurate please prepare for disappointment. This film is based on a graphic novel which in turn is loosely based on the Battle of Thermopylae. Any of the 1 start reviewers here could have flipped the DVD cover over, Googled the film or picked up a newspaper to learn this before writing their reviews which blast it for historical inaccuracies. If that's what you're looking, for this is a 1 star movie, move on and save yourself a couple hours.I was intellectually capable of finding that hidden nugget of information out before seeing the film so I had no such expectations. I loved Sin City and brought some expectations from that experience and found a very different movie. The film is absolutely beautiful and seemed to me to capture the graphic novel perfectly. The sepia tones, the costumes and the 600 bulging pectorals made for a pretty cool war movie. The action was fun but a tad slow for my taste. I understand why the Director choose not to show the true power of a hoplite army. It would not have fit the style of the film and instead the individuality during the battle was far more appropriate.That said, there is near zero character development. It was disappointing but the stunning visuals made this far more worthy of my $10. This version of the DVD maybe help flesh out some of the characters (it certainly can't lessen it) and breath some humanity into the characters allwoing them to become truly heroic. It might also help humanize at least 1 of the ""1,000 nations of the Persian Empire"" who were pretty much villianized. I disagree with the reviewers who this this is Bush propaganda as well. The film follows the novel which was written before 9/11.Overall the film gives ytou some better than average action and a hell of a lot of eye candy that make up for the lack of anything resembling a character. I treated it like an amusement park ride. For the 3 minutes I spent on the rollar coaster it was thrilling but once it ended I just wanted a longer and more intense ride."	4.0	A Delicious Treat for the Eyes...	2007-07-22	7	5	2
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3MKHD3AKS69BH	"Danny Kim ""Taste"""	This film had a lot of hype behind the trailer, which was one of the best in recent years.  With a remixed version of a Nine Inch Nails track, we were thrown into the epic battle between Spartans and Persians.I found the acting to be effective when they were in battle or trying to rile up the troops.  However, the performances in the 300's Senate were woeful compared to that of Gladiator's Derek Jacobi and Joaquin Phoenix.  Thankfully, it doesn't linger too long on the acting.  The action is beautifully choreographed, albeit gory at times.As for the HD-DVD format, I'm really looking forward to seeing the blue screen picture-in-picture feature in parallel to the film.  For all the juvenile Blu Ray fanboys, that is a feature they will not be getting.  Picture quality will be an exact digital duplicate VC-1 encoding.  The only plus of the Blu Ray version is an extra PCM track, but the difference between Dolby TrueHD and PCM is negligible to any average consumer and even most audiophiles.  If you have the option of either format, you'd have to be stupid not to buy the HD-DVD version for the P-I-P feature unless you are blind.	5.0	Great Popcorn Version of Gladiator	2007-07-10	13	11	2

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2I2DE1DJUVQOO	DarthRad	"Like so many others, I saw the high definition trailer for this movie and was hooked. WOW! Incredible style and visuals! Great music! Must go see the movie! And so I did. And at the end, it was like....yawn.....ok .....so that was it?For despite its enormously powerful graphic design and action-packed scenes, the movie ultimately fails in a number of areas.The first and foremost is as entertainment. In between the enthralling CGI-heavy battle scenes with all the blood spraying everywhere and the heads and limbs getting lopped off, the pacing is surprisingly slow. The movie FEELS slow, largely because of awkward plot elements and really clumsy dialogue. The best parts of the movie are basically already in that high definition trailer.Several subplots and scenes just didn't feel right. All that stuff that happened between Queen Gorgo and Theron just didn't make sense - was she a proud Queen trying to save her city-state, a devoted wife trying to save her husband, a cheap whore, an angry woman unable to control her temper, what was all that supposed to be about? And those scenes where Leonidas's Captain goes berserk with grief when his son is killed - isn't this guy supposed to be a SPARTAN? A manly man's man of a soldier, practically exalting in the chance to die in battle, all of a sudden breaking down like that?The dialogue....""Freedom isn't free!"" says Queen Gorgo....ahem... (more on this freedom stuff later). The worst had to be the long speech at the end of the movie to the Spartan troops by Delios (played by David Wenham, a.k.a. Captain Faramir from ""Lord of the Rings"" - in disguise wearing only a red cape and bikini pants - but still recognizable with that nose and slight Aussie accent). So much like its counterpart in Shakespeare's ""Henry V"" that I half expected Delios/Captain Faramir to finish his speech with a stirring reference to St. Crispin's Day.And all those deformed mutants....OK, so we know that Frank Miller has this thing for them, especially together with beautiful semi-naked women.....but still, isn't there some sort of a Society for the Prevention of Making Fun of Deformed People to protest this sort of stuff? After a while it just got too grotesque, and detracted from some of the really beautiful, poetic artwork of this movie. I don't know about you, but that scene with the Oracle and the horribly deformed Ephor was just gross...(the real Ephors, by the way, were the elected representatives in the government of Sparta and had nothing to do with the Oracle of Delphi and were certainly not leperous mutants).It has been a long Hollywood tradition to pick upon the commonly perceived enemies of America and utilize them as villains for its movies, and then portray them in grotesque stereotype. In other eras, these villains have included the evil Nazis, the evil Japanese, and the evil communist Russians and Chinese. And so, not surprisingly in this movie, with the overtones of our current political climate, the Persians are the evil villains, and are portrayed as heavily body-pierced, bejeweled non-Caucasian caricatures. In contrast, the heroic Spartan soldiers, are of course all portrayed by handsome white men of northern/western European descent.You might begin to guess by now that there is much in this movie that defies the real history of what happened at Thermopylae and in ancient Greece. While many critics have leveled this charge already, rather than nitpicking again at the obvious, I would focus on the one criticism that has not been emphasized, and that is that the worst falsehood of all of this movie is its depiction of the Spartans as heroic defenders of freedom.The reality is that the Spartans were an elite minority in their own city-state. They had migrated there and conquered and enslaved the original inhabitants of the area, who became the helots, the very large slave class of Spartan society. Like every war-making tribe of the time, they fought mainly to enslave and gain power over other people. They would band together with the other Greek city-states just long enough to fight off the Persian threat before getting back to the business of fighting the other Greeks again for local superiority. And so the triumph over the Persians would be followed by the Peloponnesian War, the Corinthian War, etc., etc. Ironically, at the end of the Corinthian War, the Spartans would sell out the cities of Cyprus and Iona to the Persian Empire in order to gain an advantage over the other Greek city-states in the peace treaty.So with all this talk of ""freedom"" in this movie, the truth is that freedom was for the Spartans only. They did not share their freedom with anyone else. It would be as if a movie were made depicting Confederate soldiers fighting in the American Civil War as defenders of freedom. Brave and loyal to each other and their cause, yes, defenders of their slave-owning ways of life yes, but defenders of freedom, absolutely not.One final bummer - that terrific bit of music used in the trailer for this movie does NOT appear in the movie, nor is it on the movie soundtrack CD. It turns out to be ""Just Like You Imagined"", by Nine Inch Nails, from the album ""The Fragile""."	2.0	The Good: stunning visuals. The Bad: awful dialogue, nonsensical subplots, really bad history.

While the director and writers took liberties with history, they did so to give the audience an entertaining popcorn movie with an amazing and visually pleasing look that sets the mood for the entire movie.The story is centered around the Spartan King played by Gerard Butler, probably best known for his role in ""Phantom of the Opera"".  Butler is charasmatic as King Leonidas, who takes three hundred of his best warriors to stop an advance of the Persian empire into the Greek lands.  With a brilliant plan to halt the overwhelming numbers he faces, the king takes his men to a pass that will allow the men to fight the invaders on a more level playing field.Back in Sparta, Leonidas' Queen is trying to get the council to agree to send military aid to her husband and his band of brave soldiers.  While the Queen tries to muster help for the 300, the villianous leader of the Persians, Xerxes, sends wave after wave of men, unsuccessfully, to fight the Spartans who would rather die than retreat.  The Queen knows that she is fighting the clock, and her husband and his men will need help to eventually rebuff the onslaught by the huge Persian army.I didn't read Frank Miller's graphic novel that the film is based on.  However, I would love to see the novel, now,  and compare the two.  Zack Snyder does a great job with this film that leaves you rooting for Leonidas and his out numbered troop of men.  The golden hues of wheat in the fields, the dark gray skies, the coldness of winter are all visually pleasing and the special effects are well done.  All the actors do well with their roles but it is Butler who stands out as Leonidas.  While none of these actors will win accolades for these roles, they nonetheless turn in good performances in the first really entertaining action movie of the year.

I will give it 3 stars for some of the battle sequences, but it's hard to get passed how poorly the Persian Empire was portrayed.  I see a lot of people dismissing this as ""just entertainment"" and such, but's there was certainly an agenda being force fed to the audience here.  The Persians were shown as mutants who lured in a traitor with the promise of sex and riches...while the Spartans are always depicted as fierce warriors in the name of ""freedom.""

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2KWG1J285Z4QA	David Baltazar	"I really liked the ""300"" film. It is a very odd and unique film in terms of being classified as a fantasy, action film that is loosely based on ancient history. It falls in a category between epics with some historical significance such as ""Gladiator"" & ""Braveheart"" on one side and pure fantasy epics such as the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy on the other. Historically, one of the main reasons why the much larger Persian army were having so much trouble fighting the 300-man Spartan army was the fighting style besides the use of the narrow canyons to favor Sparta. The Persian army wasn't always well equipped to do close man-to-man combat. The Persian army was better equipped for speed and fast attacks where they can use there enormous numbers to overwhelm enemies. The 300 Spartan army were better equipped for closer man-to-man combat due to their metal shields, metal helmets and metal armor. However the films' creators found it more appealing to have the Spartans walk around bare-chested with super abs and speedos rather than wear chest armor. Most of the Persians did not wear heavy armor and had shields made of weaved leather. The Spartans favored to fight armies head on while the Persians liked to use archers from distant ranges to compliment their attacks which the Spartans disliked as cowardice as depicted in the film. Putting any historical inaccuracies aside, I think the film was still very enjoyable with all of its visual splendor and over the top mythological villains. I liked the ""washed out"" colors look with some touches of red as contrast colors. I wasn't really much of a big fan of ""Sin City"", but I think the unique look works really well and better in ""300"" instead of ""Sin City"".As far as the DVD release is concerned, it's an adequate two-disc release, but I think the special features definitely could have been better as indicated by many other reviewers. The separate DVD release of the History Channel's ""The Last Stand of the 300"" is an excellent documentary and I think it would have been much better if it was included in the ""300"" DVD two-disc special edition.  However now-a-days the way DVD manufacturers are cranking different DVD releases of the same movie, it wouldn't surprise me if that down the road we will see an ultimate edition, director's cut or some other type of super-duper edition of ""300"" with the History Channel's ""Last Stand of the 300"" included. For now, I purchased the exclusive Best Buy box set of ""300"" complete with a collectable helmet and art cards which are very cool to have. Images of my box set are in the ""custom images"" description above."	4.0	I liked it for what it is.	2007-08-06	3	2	1

Listen to this loud and you will be awestruck. The musical score sets everything up, sweeping across the room setting the tone. Turn that bass up for when the Persians march towards the spartans your room will shake, you will hear every taunt from the spartans towards the persians and the grind of the sand as they halt the persians at pass. The mix is excellent, you will hear everything from individual voices, to arrows, swords clashing to men screaming. This movie is loud.Forgive the poor qaulity in trying to describe what this film looks/sounds like in HD. Pick this up, not only is 300 a great movie but it deserves to be seen and watched in HD.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A20F7WUZGF65PR	David L. Sieving	The REAL Spartans at the REAL battle of Thermopylae personified by proxy the eternal principled struggle between art and commerce faced by the makers of this film.  Tough decisions confront those with creative control over art used in furtherance of big business.  In the case of 300, the filmmakers forfeited a golden opportunity to underscore the Spartans' unfailing discipline and teamwork - the REAL reasons for their valiant showing at Thermopylae.  Succumbing to the overwhelming hordes of bottom-line commerce, they chose instead to pander to the market for showy displays of individual martial prowess.  In the REAL battle of Thermopylae, the Spartans would have been forced into this fighting mode only in the final hours of the third day as the flanking force swung in behind them after navigating the key mountain pass around the hot gates.  Had the filmmakers opted instead for the courageous pathway of historicity, they could have achieved a cinematic spectacle beyond imagining by depicting the REAL Spartan battle arrays and the magnificent coordinated action that made them work in the face of a both numerically and technically superior force.The filmmakers also reversed a bit of history with the depiction of Leonidas' youthful rite of passage, pitting him shivering in his skivvies at odds with a Dire Wolf in the mountain wilderness outside of ancient Sparta.  According to the corresponding History Channel episode, it was actually Xerces - Leonidas' rival at Thermopylae - who was pitted in his youth against a wild animal to ensure that only self-reliant and sufficently fierce contenders would ultimately ascend to the throne of the Persian Empire.I would also take issue with the cookie-cutter physiques that only modern gym equipment or theatrical prosthetics can produce.  The real Spartans would have developed shoulders of iron after years of training with those heavy spears and shields but otherwise average athletic builds would have been more realistic and would also have sorted better with an emphasis on the raw toughness, the relentless teamwork and the intellectual sophistication that made the Spartans unique in the ancient world.  Not to mention, Xerces' forces would have made hamburger out of hoplites without armor, and the Spartans had the best in the world at the time.  Why not show them in their armor and make up for the reduced superhero effect with a better depiction of their desperate struggle, devilish coordinated tactics, unwavering discipline in the face of certain death and indomitable spirit?Having long since begun using my KindleKindle: Amazon's Wireless Reading Device, I started my reading at the very beginning of Western history with titles such as:THE HISTORIES --- UPDATED w/LINKED TOCby Herodotus - the Horse's mouth on subjects like the Spartans at Thermopylae.All that having been said, I will note in conclusion that 300, standing alone as a gesamtkunstwerk on its own polished merits against the howling hordes of nit-picking history buffs, truly rocks.	3.0	Comic Book SuperHero Genre Wears Thin on Spartan History	2009-01-25	0	0	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2LEVKA3U6CXX7	"David McCune ""self-deprecating and proud of it"""	"300 is a rare movie that succeeds as pure entertainment, as fairly accurate historical fiction, and as a movie with important messages for our times.  I'll take these in turn.Much of the critique of the movies' lack of accuracy borders on pedantic.  No, the Spartans didn't fight in the near-nude, but then again, the idealized male form has been used to depict this battle on media as diverse as classical pottery and oil on canvas.  It has a long and noble tradition.  No, Xerxes probably wasn't an 8 foot tall, bald man of a sexually ambiguous nature, but since he is meant to embody an overwhelming threat to the West, some hyperbole is not out of line.  Criticisms like this miss the larger point:  this is not meant to be Saving Private Ryan, much less a Ken Burns documentary.  It is a film depiction of a comic book that was in turn based on the battle of Thermopylae.That said, the movie still hews close to its historical roots.  The best lines come, not from Frank Miller, but from the contemporaneous history written by Herodotus in the 5th century B.C.  (when told that the arrows of the Persians will blot out the sun, the Spartans are said to have responded ""Then we will fight in the shade"").  Look, don't take my word for it.  Eminent classicist Victor Davis Hanson writes:""Again, purists must remember that 300 seeks to bring a comic book, not Herodotus, to the screen. Yet, despite the need to adhere to the conventions of Frank Miller's graphics and plot -- every bit as formalized as the protocols of classical Athenian drama or Japanese Kabuki theater -- the main story from our ancient Greek historians is still there: Leonidas, against domestic opposition, insists on sending an immediate advance party northward on a suicide mission to rouse the Greeks and allow them time to unite a defense. Once at Thermopylae, he adopts the defenses to the narrow pass between high cliffs and the sea far below. The Greeks fight both en masse in the phalanx and at times range beyond as solo warriors. They are finally betrayed by Ephialtes, forcing Leonidas to dismiss his allies -- and leaving his own 300 to the fate of dying under a sea of arrows.""If it's good enough for VDH, it's good enough for you.Finally, the movie entertains, even moves, but in so doing teaches us about ourselves and our future.  The movie is exciting as all get out.  It is hyper-violent.  And yes, the sub-plots occasionally drag.  However, the idea of an impassioned few standing up to tyranny has such resonance that the battle scenes stir like none other.  It's the blood-spattered, manly art of war set to an industrial rock soundtrack, but it's also a paean to self-sacrifice and freedom.  Like those who have answered the call of freedom at Valley Forge, Omaha Beach, and now Basra, these men fight not just for glory.  They would prefer to die fighting for freedom than live on their knees.  History has not ended.  If the West is to remain free, the we will do well to keep alive a memory of men like Leonidas, the 300 Spartans and the other Greeks who gave their lives the narrow pass of Thermopylae.5 stars"	5.0	Herodotus would give this 5 stars	2007-08-02	12	10	2

The director Zak Snyder impressed me with his remake of ""Dawn Of The Dead"". I expected something equally bloodsoaked and on that level, I was not disappointed. This film is about a battle which took place between 300 Spartans led by Leonidas and a million Persians led by Xerxes. The start of the film shows Leonidas's initiation into the Spartan way of life, being sent off to a school as a child to be brutalised and forced to hunt a giant wolf. We are left under no illusion that the Spartan way of life is exceptionally hard. What we begin to see as Leonidas is shown as an adult is the steeliness of the character of these Spartan people and their absolute refusal to surrender or give up. The battle scenes in this movie are amazing. They are really choreographed beautifully. The scenery is also beautiful - almost completed done on a green screen using CGI special effects. Each character looks almost surreal. Every Spartan soldier has a regulation six pack (most definitely added afterwards !). Some of the Spartan adversaries look really spectacular especially the giant king Xerxes with the extremely low voice. I also enjoyed some of the monstrous creatures led into battle by the Persians by chains and set loose on the Spartan army. Of course, this film is hardly accurate historically. Some of the creatures in this film look like extras from Hellraiser or 13 Ghosts. However, for pure entertainment , this film is on a par with other Frank Miller creations like 'Sin City' and is worth a trip to the cinema or the video store to see.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2K88E641I9JZ9	Derrick Kuiper	I absolutely love this movie.  This is by far the best adaptation of one of Frank Miller's graphic novels.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good war movie or something historical-related.  One word of caution on the history though, keep in mind that while the general history is preserved in tact this is an adaptation of a GRAPHIC NOVEL, so it is not going to be completely accurate as it is going to have elements of fantasy, most of which is symbolic not historic.  In other words kids, don't base your history essay off the movie; although, there are some wonderful historical commentaries included on the disc which would be of use in a history class essay or research paper.  Just don't forget to footnote.A note on the blu-ray:  The blu-ray is mostly absolutely fantastic.  The movie was shot a little grainy at times on purpose (don't forget, it is supposed to be like watching a graphic novel), and this is most evident when David Wenham's character is relating the story of the movie to the Greek army on the eve of the battle at Plataea.  In those scenes, the graininess is almost a little too distracting.  Other than that, the blu-ray looks magical.	5.0	300  :)	2009-11-27	1	0	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2EIEXQVCPXZNG	Dimitrios	"Certainly this movie has its merits regarding the depiction of ancient Spartans' ethos and war prowess. The development of the story is good, the battle scenes really terrific and the tactics used by the Spartan phalanx are well depicted, but there are some oddities which I must admitt serve as a spice for this film. The monsters in Xerxes camp, the disfigured Ephialtes (who was not a Spartan but a local traitor), the mask-wearing Immortals with inhuman faces, the monster-like Spartan ephors (in fact they were common people elected for a year's term through vote, and not disfigured dropouts of society) and the improbably tall king Xerxes could have been avoided if the director wanted to follow the real historical events more strictly. I agree that the costumes of the Persian envoys thrown into the well, are more relevant to the appearance of the Immortals than the costumes they have in the film but the real purpose behind these oddities is probably to terrify the modern viewer and place him in Spartans' shoes, making him/her feel the real terror and excitement of battle. The film uses some famous historical phrases said by Spartans men and women (as Herodotus and other historians reproduced them) but also takes some liberties regarding certain details. Two of them: Leonidas should have been around 60 at the time of the battle of Thermopylae and not so young as the film implies, and also the capital letter Lamda was not in standard use on Spartan shiels during this period but after the 4th century BC. Also I was a little bit annoyed that historical names or phrases were spelled in English rather than the original Greek. Thus Thermopylae became Hot Gates, Leonidas' name was misspelled and the famous laconic reply ""Molon Lave"" was just ""Come and get them!""."	5.0	A fascinating movie with some oddities	2007-03-21	9	5	4

Stokes	I didn't know much of what to expect--just that it was a historical war movie.I tell you this so you'll understand why I was underwhelmed for the first quarter of the movie. The monochromatic filming, mostly in sepia tones, but then occasionally in blues, got pretty irritating. And then there was the Heroic Music and the Ominous Music trying to get me all excited or worried about characters I didn't even know yet. And that was really irritating.It starts off with voice-over narration and a little boy going off to be trained as a Spartan warrior. Complete with a weird-looking CGI wolf. I couldn't figure out why they couldn't use a real wolf. Lots of scrawny kid skulking around being shadowed by a goofy looking wolf with the dramatic music. In sepia.Truthfully, I was tempted it to the males and go off to the computer or a book.But it's a good thing I kept watching. Once the boy grew up, he became King Leonidas (Gerard Butler). Xerxes of Persia invades, and Leonidas goes to the Oracle to get... well, basically to get permission to repel the invasion. But the priests are paid off and they advise against it. So Leonidas takes 300 men for a walk.There's intrigue back home as the Queen tries to send reinforcements, but mostly, it's battle scenes. The fighting did really remind me of the Alerans inCaptain's Fury (Codex Alera, Book 4)--the shieldwall type of fighting and the disciplined soldiers were very familiar.The cinematography continues, with the colored filters and a somewhat dizzying switching between slow motion and fast forward. Here's where knowing what I was getting into might have helped. I've since discovered that 300 is based on a graphic novel that's based on a movie that's based on history. And then it made sense--the cinematography gave it that stylish, surrealistic feel that fits with the graphic novel.It also made the violence much easier to take for this squeamish viewer.So, 4 stars, but if I'd known what to expect, I'd probably have enjoyed it a half-star more.	4.0	wish I'd known what to expect	2008-11-22	2	2	0

Plus all the guys in 300 are so buffed I'm stoked to work out more. . . maybe break out that loin cloth I've been storing in moth balls all these years.  And I just have to have a Spartan helmet; I'd look good in one, no doubt.I'm sure not into graphic novels, but that doesn't take away my enjoyment of 300, based on Frank Miller's bestseller.  Folks, this isn't historical accuracy (so get over yourselves)--this is visual entertainment at a graphic, artistic level.  And director Zack Snyder (who so reminds me of  college dorm-mates who always have cool stuff) delivers stunning visuals in spades:  From raw violence (in graphic slow motion, of course) to aesthetic motifs (all of it shot against green screen, then computer enhanced).  Based on an ancient tale of Spartan endurance and epic heroism, this movie hits the ground running and never, ever, lets up.Good stuff (for a guy).The cast is great:  As King Leonidas, Gerard Butler looks like he could swallow my pillow with his gaping jaw lines; David Wenham is exceptional as the story's narrator; Rodrigo Santoro creepy and campy as an androgynous Xerxes; and Lena Heady (as Queen Gorgo) is smokin' hot.  The second DVD to this special edition is well worth the time, as we get to climb into the heads of Miller, Snyder, Butler. . .and take another look at lovely Lena.

I am not a fan of graphic novels but the vivid stylization and surreal backdrops of this film make it by far one of the most visually captivating films I have seen in at least a decade. 300 is not an epic fairy tale of Lord of the Rings or Gladiator proportions, but rather a brilliantly perceived historical telling masterfully produced with modern appeal. Though not wholly accurate, this version of the battle of Thermopylae is definitely exciting and inspiring. [Quit quibbling! We know the facial piercings, makeup, chromium masks, sexed-up costumes and deformities are exaggerations. That is why it is called ""entertainment""!! As long as it gets a history book opened somewhere...] Breathtaking photography sets the stage for a group of actors so well congealed even the real Leonidas would be proud. Characters burst out of virtually every scene with emotion the likes that god has never seen. A steely ride through the depths of human passion, greed, desire, honor, lust and even humor. If you can only make one trip this spring, visit Sparta. It's amazing in the shade.*In regards to all the critic comments of a film for, ""male posturing and bravado"", this is one woman Spartan enough to call you out on those statistics.**Somewhere I envision a tattoo of the words, ""The Twenty-Five"" encircling a tribal pug's head.

Quite a few scenes reminded me of ""Savage sword of Conan"" comics I read in my younger years.2. Great audio, listened to the pcm 5.1 track, excellent use of surrounds and bass effects.Those are the only two redeeming factors in my opinion, now the bad:Poor HD picture quality (pq): this movie is soft and lacks detail, looks like SD-DVD on my front projection 1080i, 92 inch display. PQ Compares very poorly to BD movies like ""Apocalypto"" or ""Fifth Element"" remastered. This may be a consequence of using a lot of grain and sepia effect to give it the mythology feel but it doesn't do the pq any justice.Very weak movie, i like the sword and sandals genre, but I expect some character development, I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters so it didn't matter whenever they met their demise. Also the dialog was so weak it was painful. OK, I know it's loosely based on the battle of Marathon but is it too much to ask that the Persians look like humans? Did I miss a lesson in Geography class? Last time I checked Persia(present day Iran) was not in the African continent. What's up with all the black Kings and nobles?It is based on a Frank Miller comic so I expected a lot of gore but how many times do we need to see a sword/spear run through someone?

Second of all the movie it self SUCKS big time. Very simple, basic right down dumb story line. You can accurately predict the whole movie along with the ending after the first 10 minutes of it.  The movie has absolutely no historical or mythological values what so ever (like The Gladiator or Troy for example).

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1OMFPO9MA1GYS	Donald J. Keck	300: AN OPPORTUNITY BUNGLEDHere was an opportunity to convey a genuine message about liberty, resistance to tyranny and self sacrifice in the cause of freedom. It is the story of how Western Civilization was nearly extinguished, virtually at birth, by the might of Oriental Despotism. Xerxes, the Persian King of Kings, threatened to overwhelm the tiny Greek city states with a vast army, thus putting a premature end to Western Civilization: before Socrates, Plato and Aristotle; before Dante, Shakespeare and Milton; before Melville, Dickens Dostoyevsky, and Conrad; before Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin and Einstein; before Christianity, the Reformation, the Enlightenment and the Declaration of Independence; before the emergence of individual liberty, equality of opportunity, the rule of law, and the private ownership of property; before the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of women - all products of Western Civilization.But for the heroic stand of a handful of Greek soldiers who fought to preserve the freedom of their polis, all of this would have been aborted before it could come into existence.Now, after 2,500 years, Hollywood has managed to trivialize one of the great turning points of civilization. The story of the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae has been turned into just another horror flick, with all the usual artificial monsters and leaping, prancing cartoon super heroes. As usual, the lesson is lost in the special effects.Hollywood today seems incapable of making an historical drama without trivializing it. It cannot make a comedy without smut, a war movie without confusing good and evil, a mystery without turning it into a morass of contradiction and confusion, a thriller without an interminable and boring car chase. It cannot make a romantic movie because it no longer believes in the possibility of real love. It no longer knows how to tell a story, or how to end one. And it cannot make any kind of movie at all without infecting it with politics, political correctness and moral equivalence.From the 1930s to the 1950s Hollywood turned out hundreds of fine movies every year. Even the so called B (for budget) movies were generally intelligent, entertaining and often inspiring.  Today it would be miraculous if Hollywood managed to produce two or three such films a year (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List and Something the Lord Made come to mind).The movie industry since the 1970s is incapable of producing movies as consistently excellent as Random Harvest or Mrs. Miniver; Casablanca, 12 O'Clock High or Sands of Iwo Jima; Paths of Glory, The Fighting 69th or Sergeant York; The Seventh Cross or They Came to Cordura; Gone With the Wind  or For Whom the Bell Tolls; High Noon or Bad Day at Black Rock; Dial M for Murder, Little Caesar,  House of Strangers or The Treasure of the Sierra Madre; It's a Wonderful Life or The Best Years of Our Lives; To Kill a Mockingbird or Gentleman's Agreement; The Last Hurrah, Moby Dick, The Sea Wolf or The African Queen -- to mention only a handful of the great films of the past.Instead, it turns out rivers of junk.For a really worthwhile movie about Leonidas and the Battle of Thermopylae see The 300 Spartans (1962, starring Richard Eagan).

Director Snyder of ""Dawn of the Dead"" fame utilizes the some of the same cutting edge CGI graphics techniques that ""Sin City"" (Frank Miller novel/film) encased upon and in us.  The green screen gives the director creativity control of mind blowing proportions that relate with Frank Miller's imagination. Imagination brought to life as we read and see it.This is manly man's film; blood, guts and glory are glorified to the death.  Nudity and violence are prevalent throughout the film and it only slows pace when the Queen of Sparta (Lena Headey) is shown defending/supporting her King. As needed, courage, honor and camaraderie are all traits coveted when filming any war/battle film and this film is no different.  But an empathized point is the skill level of Spartan soldiers as they are bore into childhood and made into a Spartan Army soldier, he is not a part time soldier.

And to do so for something higher than one's self and for the belief in your country, family and friendship.  This movie with the deep thoughts of the war on terror we face today.  Our world has changed.  There are people out there with strong beliefs and standards who are not afraid to die for something they believe in.  Right or wrong, this is their belief.	5.0	300 - something for everyone	2007-09-03	0	0	0

I understand that is an actual quote, according to Herodotus, who wrote of this historical event. I'm glad the story of such men is being told. What does it matter if there is some artistic license? Who among us knows every actual detail anyway? It's the lesson that counts.Gerard Butler is Fantastic as King Leonidas. He has absorbed the heart and soul of the man, and brought him to life so beautifully and heroically, that you leave the theater a little bit in love with the man he is showing you.Vincent Regan delivers a memorable performance as his captain, actually all the performers have done a beautiful job, as well as the director, Zack Snyder.In addition to the beautiful acting, the scenery was like a constant work of art, and the movements of the warriors were truly, as one person described: ""a warrior ballet.""  I appreciated the fact that the blood was cartoon style, as it then did not distract from the action and movements of these graceful story tellers. The music was a perfect compliment, deepening the emotionality.I would just like to thank the people who brought us this fabulous movie. I watched it numerous times in the theater and can hardly wait for the DVD to come out so I can watch it again."	5.0	We should remember and honor these men!	2007-06-03	13	9	4
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ARJ2L3J5GPHRM	"Doug D. Johnson ""Doug Johnson"""	This extremely entertaining  action packed movie, is loosely based on the battle of Thermopylae which pitted the 7,000 man coalition armies of the Grecian States including 300 Spartan troops with the huge army of the Persian King Xerxes which is estimated to has been between 200,000 and 1,000,000 men.First the action . . . well filmed and choreographed combat scenes of close in hand to hand combat is thrilling and chilling. Not for the faint hearted. The tactical strengths of the Spartan warriors is captured as the Persian's crash against the Grecian phalanx, a well disciplined wall of heavily armed Grecian men locking shields together and thrusting spears to the front of the shields. The lightly armored Persians (light armor worked for the Persians on the wide planes of their homeland, but not now) are cut to pieces. It is thought that 20,000 Persians died in the course of this battle. The pass at Thermopylae is really thought to be as narrow as it looks in this film, around 100 yards.The strategic weakness of the Thermopylae was a locally known path that would not allow for cavalry, but would support foot soldiers. In the confusion of battle the men guarding this path left and the Persians used it to attack the Greeks from the rear. It is at this point that the Spartan King dismissed his Grecian allies and formed a rear guard. The men from several other Greek states also refused to leave giving the rear guard around 1,000 troupes which were all killed after being surrounded. A heroic stand it certainly was.Not to detract from the entertainment value of the movie the following should be pointed out: Sparta was an extremely oppressive Grecian state; it enslaved an entire bordering Grecian state so as to exploit it for food while Sparta trained for war; Sparta embarked on a brutal repression of these people using murder, torture and other atrocities to keep them under control; Sparta was no friend of freedom . . . after conquering the republic of Athens, Sparta forced Athens to return to a King as ruler, and through intimidation managed to keep its allies as monarchies; Sparta engaged in institutionalized homosexuality; Sparta was ultra conservative in their military strategy and unable to adapt to changing military advances such as the use of the bow and strategic movement of troops  which was ultimately the reason for its down fall; their was no free combat for the Spartan warrior; Spartans warriors could and did surrender; the Spartans were not the only warriors to stay and die at the Battle of Thermopylae  . . . there were 1000 other Grecian warriors who stayed and died. The Spartans did display many admirable attributes such as loyalty, bravery, etc.If you want to get the full story about Sparta there are many such books such as Thermopylae: The Battle for the West or Ancient Wars: Sparta which are available at [...] Or look it up in Wikipedia which has a really extensive and well documented account.Still, this is a great movie!!!	4.0	Little historical accuracy but a great action movie.	2007-11-09	1	1	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3EU1VA71UT4EC	Dragon	"This movie has no meaning.  Throughout the movie I had a hard time understanding why they chose to fight.  And it seems that it is over arrogance.  This movie holds extremely horrible values.  The movie just shows how 300 stupid men chose to commit suicide over arrogant values.  So they say it is Spartan law, never surrender, never retreat.  So let's just die for pride and kill as many people as possible before we die.  This movie further escalates the violence of this society.This movie is nothing compared to Gladiator.  Although it tries so much to imitate Gladiator, it fails completely.  The movie just glorifies the violence that was contained in the movie gladiator, such as the scene of the head being chopped off and it just figures that it would gain the audience base for just having many gruesome scenes of heads being decapitated.  But what they forgot is to make a meaningful movie the way Gladiator did.The movie is like playing a violent video game; it is just seeing a bunch of people killing each other for absolutely no reason.  The movie shows how stupid people can be to choose war over love, to leave their wives and children at home in order to fight for pride, to never show love b/c that equals weakness, to enter into war prancing around without a shirt and forget to protect yourself with armor, to leave 300 abandoned families b/c of your competitive ego.  The movie shows how stupid people can waste their lives away, living for violence.  These 300 stupid ""Spartans!"" represent the gang members of modern society who kill people b/c of competition, greed, money, women, jealousy, etc.  Movies like this should be banned from society; movies like this teach our children and adults who cannot think for themselves to feel comfortable killing and hurting people for unjustifiable reasons.Luckily I borrowed this movie and did not have to waste my money on this garbage.  Shame on the people who created this movie for not caring about the society and how violent it is at the moment.  Shame on them for contributing to the senseless violence of this world, and for educating our children and adults to kill over senseless reasons.  Shame on them for only thinking about themselves and how much money they are going to make over the lives that are lost in this world"	1.0	Senseless violence, horrible.	2007-08-10	25	8	17

Careless, mocking, forceful - so does wisdom wish us: she is a woman, and never loves any one but a warrior. - `Thus Spake Zarathustra' by Frederick Nietzsche.You are invited to carefully peruse and gaze into the Coliseum of the imaginative mind, consider the lush and graphic gladiatorial battle between good and evil. Ancient warriors laugh into the face of death, amidst the oldest creation myths concerned with the eternal  dualistic struggle between light and dark. Even today these opposing energies infuse our daily lives and charge us with the necessity of choosing one or the other; from the simplest to the most immense. Do we stick with the lo-fat/cholesterol, free range, organic diet to remain slim, or blow everything away and eat the incredibly decadent triple chocolate extravaganza, and become enslaved, shackled and obedient to the infernal God of gluttony? Republican or Democrat? Capitalism or Communism? Bible or Quran? Death penalty or Liberal re-education and integration? Levi's or Wrangler's? And the list goes on and on, from the mundane to the exotic and extremely eccentric. At Thermoplye in 480 BCE the fight was between a localized democratic austerity and a world dominating religious mysticism, the Spartan king Leonidas attempted to halt the Persian invasion of Greece under Xerxes the man-god.Some individuals have seen 300 as a cleverly disguised political commentary on the current situation in the Middle East and Iraq, but this depends on whether you view President Bush as a decadent religious divine or a self appointed, idealistic warrior of morality. I didn't see such interpretations in this movie. For me, Bush rarely even displays grammatical correctness never mind the greater intellectual prowess necessary for successful international dialog; at any level, be it militarily, economically or diplomatically. 300 doesn't play devious or subtle mind games, it lays the facts bare and presents us with a main dynamic; the evaluation of human emotion and motive, although there are some undertones of nationalism and religion. This clash is depicted in comic book fashion, an almost surreal and fantastic parody of humanity, the distinctions are sharpened to resemble a `chiascuro-esque painting by Carravagio which is viewed with absolute horror, intrigue and beautiful sadness. The passionate totality of birth, life and death are here, but yet still one asks `What is the point?' to which a Spartan warrior might reply; `The point is that which is at the end of my spear!'It is like one USMC recruitment video intricately woven into yet another, only different costumes in another part of human history. There are only two main female characters in the movie, first the lush and exotic oracle girl, and the queen and wife of Leonidas and who unfortunately is placed in the position of bargaining for her husband's life with her sexuality. But here again the emotional and domestic rivalries and disputes reflect those on a national and international level. Only Spartan women give birth to real men, is the sum total experience of her femininity within this society; a concept that is as difficult for us to understand today as it is to comprehend the traditional Islamic way of life. This is a movie by men for men and many of the scenes linger on the rich musky sweat of bold masculinity.300 is incredibly sharp, I struggled to breath in the last sequence with king Leonidas standing against a mighty army of thousands with his little band of men. Their choice was to deal completely with that precise moment in time, not to avoid or consider the consequences of their actions but remain true to themselves; to accept total responsibility. If such a movie contains a lesson it is this, temper your imagination and increase your resolve in all situations, concentrate with all attention on that which you are facing... allow no distractions and proceed without fear."	4.0	300 (and one night)	2008-01-02	2	0	2

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2VJ80PM1G00QV	drkhimxz	I do not accept consistency with reality as a necessity in a film. For those interested in a brief but decent review of expert opinion on the subject of reality in 300, see the article on the film (Wiki, subject, 300 Film). Just one point, familiar to those of us who were around for all of the ruling days of Hitler. This is made very clear in 300, so it requires nothing beyond what is enunciated in the film. Query: What would/should you think of a society that makes as its primary educational goal  the training of each male child in the arts of combat beyond all other learning and commitment to achievement in War beyond all other achievements to mark success in life.Enough of that. What about the movie itself. It certainly gave us a colorful, action filled, balletic vision of hand to hand combat. It didn't happen to be accurate but we have put that issue aside. My lack of satisfaction with it in purely cinemagraphic terms was the absence of the kind of tension, the constant uncertainty as to outcome, both individual and collective, that marks the best combat scenes on film. It was Superman (supermen) against a group of ferocious looking completely untrained equivalents of office clerks. It did not ring true (not true in the sense of what really went on in hand to hand combat, but true in the cinemagraphic sense-how can you be a HERO, if you are fighting the equivalent of the kids who had never held a gun whom Hitler sent to face the Russian Army as it approached Berlin). I liked the acrobatic techniques but never felt for a moment that these could be real people fighting  a real battle.What there was of non-combat related scenes were conventional and non-involving. One felt that, well, that give us a brief shot of the wife and brief shot of the nasty traitor; oh, and to be sure that we know how bad the guy was, he persuades the Queen to have sex with him to get his support in a vote. Not enough?  we see the Persian gold pouring out his tunic (neat trick that) when she deals with him later.What would I recommend: if you like choreographed, colorful display (by one party to hand to hand combat), and splashy camera work painting a portrait of  war, this should suit you. If you are going to think about what you are seeing, you might want to look elsewhere.	3.0	Fine (Although Inaccurate) Battle Scenes	2013-06-08	0	0	0
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A35YWA2V4QHOJ3	"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12"""	"OK, at the outset, let's have out with the obvious:  they did some historical fudging.  There, now it's all out in the open & there will be no surprises.  I've not read any other reviews, but I'm sure some of them will go to great lengths to point out the places in the movie where historical veracity was lacking.I would like to take a slightly different approach.  The makers of the movie obviously knew their history, and there are some subtle allusions to historical fact, IF you're willing to look closely.First off, the bit about Leonidas climbing up to see the Ephors and the oracle was nonsense.  HOWEVER, this was a legitimate historical allusion to the Oracle of Delphi, which is where the Spartans & all the other Greeks went to seek the sage guidance of the gods (namely Apollo).  It is true that the Spartans were very religious;  they were tardy to the battle of Marathon because they had to wait until the full of the moon.  In reality, the Ephors were a part of the governmental apparatus;  they were mid-level Spartan officers.  There were 5 of them and they served as a sort of oversight committee.  The Spartan girl mimicked the Pythia, who would fall into a trance and predict the future @ Delphi.The Greek coalition with the Spartans played a far greater role than is shown in the film.  Also, the Thespians and the Lacedamon Helots stayed behind w/the Spartans and fought to a last man.  This fact is absent from the movie.  However, we need to remember that the focus of the film was, after all, to be on the 300.It is nonsense that Leonidas nearly took 1/2 of Xerxes' face off in the final confrontation.  HOWEVER, according to legend there was an assasination attempt on Xerxes' life on the 2nd night.  So the story goes, a covert group of Spartans penetrated the Persian camp and nearly got him.  Nobody knows whether this is historically accurate or not.  In any case, this scene is a nice symbolic representation of that episode.Now on to the the most interesting aspects of the film.  Gerard Butler is terrific as the gallant Leonidas;  a strong leader, determined, true to the Spartan code-of-honor and very focused on his objective.  Lena Headey is his equal as the Spartan queen, Gorgo.  It's also nice to note how the film points out how Spartan women had more rights than elsewhere in the ancient world.  The scene where Gorgo speaks in front of the Gerousia is tenable as the voices of Spartan women WERE taken seriously.The battle scenes are well done, and the very first battle scene is likely the closest as cinema will ever come to re-creating how the Lacedamons actually fought in their phalanx.  I rather doubt any other film will ever be able to out-do it, whether it's made next year or 500 years from now.  As King Leonidas would say:  ""Your spear is for yourself;  your shield is for the line!""In my mind, this film has something for everyone.  Women will like it because it includes a genuine Spartan love story, + the Spartans are all buffed up.  Men will like it because it's a war movie filled up-close-and-personal battle scenes.  Historians will like it because it provides an impressionistic representation of what happened @ Thermopylae in August of 480BCE.  The movie even contains an anachronistic allusion to King Aegisalius.  What more could you ask for?For those who wish to have further reading I would recommendThe Histories (Penguin Classics),Gates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of ThermopylaeandThermopylae: The Battle for the West.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AXPN8L8QI2Z4A	"Dr.||\\//|| ""To Hope is to do Magic"""	The film is a jarring inconsistency of some of the most well chirographed fight scene ever yet filmed, some completely over the top fantasy creaturish humans (in a supposedly historical setting), some flinchingly bad dialog, and really embarrassingly comic book scenes and caricatures.I loved this film, and I hated the guys who screwed it up.  This film had truly great potential with a far deeper plot than Braveheart, greater scope and even greater armies than Lord of the Rings.But things were just wrong, the consummating moment for the hero of the story was cut short like it had begun and was instantly edited to the end for no apparent reason.  The Introduction to the hero looked like a scene for Jungle Book, it actually had a Wolf with glowing eyes.  Much of the dialog looked like it was taken off the back of a patriotic serial box and then just Greekified and repeated with no apparent rhythm, and almost comically the soundtrack seemed to try to beef up every really bad section of dialog with really grand music.This film could have been great instead it's only good; but giving honor to whom it is due.  It has what is probably a three minute sword fight complete with about twenty kills done from one camera angle.  In terms of filming, it is a triumph like nothing I've ever seen; and in terms of viewing, you've got to see it!  So many things in there are still that good that I totally recommend it.

Call me an old-timer, but I miss the sweeping epics of Stanley Kubrick ('Spartacus') and Cy Endfield ('Zulu'). And after viewing this film, I can certainly understand the cries of those who were bothered by the movie's racist overtones: The Persians were depicted as everything BUT human.Zack Snyder is a talented director. Praise to him for being inventive and imaginative, and yes, this is historical fantasy, not a precise documentary, but in my opinion, he took far too much ""artistic license"" with this work. For starters, he tried too hard to make the movie look like Frank Miller's book. A big mistake, with many of the scenes filmed in this nauseating blend of full color and sepia tone. The movie is described as 'loosely' based on the Battle of Thermopylae, and the word loosely should be spelled with capital letters:The historical inaccuracies are numerous. Xerxes' Immortals are shown throwing what amounts to hand grenades. But the use of gunpowder did not come into widespread military use until the Northern Song dynasty in China, around 1044 AD, hundreds of years after Thermopylae. The Immortals are also shown wearing what appears to be chrome masks, a metal that would have been unknown then.The Persian army is shown using war elephants. While true they used them, it did not occur until later, particularly in their campaigns against Alexander the Great. And as far as the 'battle rhinoceros' is concerned, this was so ludicrous that it doesn't merit discussion.Then there is King Xerxes himself, depicted as a multi-pierced, gold chain wearing freak-slash-ghetto pimp daddy on a power trip. No wonder people of Persian decent were howling with anger upon seeing this film. Other Persians were shown as half monster/half human beings that simply did not exist then...or now. In one of the deleted scenes on the 2-disk set, Snyder talks about a scene involving giants with Persian archers on their backs. Snyder says the scene was cut from the final version because it was ""into the stratosphere""..i.e., 'over the top'. Gee, no kidding. Like he hadn't done enough of that already??The stop-motion, accelerate/decelerate fight scenes are more annoying than entertaining. ""The Matrix"" meets history is not a good mix. And many of the battle sequences are too dark.As for the plus points, there's plenty of half-naked, well-muscled man candy to keep the giddy female viewers interested. Lots of cartoonish blood spattering, mindless violence (as war sometimes is) and a couple of scenes of gratuitous nudity for the guys. For a better review, read the one by Garrett Stiger. He hit the nail on the head for this movie.In a strange and ironic twist, Frank Miller, who wrote the graphic novel, was inspired by the 1962 film ""The 300 Spartans"" as a kid. For all of its corn and cheesy cold war overtones, this movie is still superior to ""300"".All in all, not a bad film. But a golden opportunity has been lost. Zack Snyder had a chance to make a spectacular historical epic, but instead made a busy, overly stylized film that twists an actual event into more fantasy than reality. This is history for the 'Gen-X' crowd....a generation of people with a culturally induced attention deficit disorder, where we no longer watch the news and absorb it, but have our brains bombarded with 10-second soundbites. The sort of people who'll enjoy this film....most of them good folks....are the ones who get bored easily. If there's not someone getting shot/naked/blown up every 15 seconds, they're ready to change channels or tune out.What a pity.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2TXR85WQLE32N	D. S. Thurlow	"""300"" renders the doomed stand of King Leonides and his 300 Spartan warriors at Thermopylae against an invading Persian horde as grand and exciting modern myth, in the graphic style of ""Sin City"", also the brain-child of graphic novelist Frank Miller.The movie opens with a short prologue that introduces us to King Leonides and to the Spartan warrior ethic.  The story properly gets underway with the arrival of a Persian emissary demanding the submission of Sparta to King Xerxes of Persia, self-styled god and ruler of the world.  Leonides tosses the emissary into a pit by way of answer.Complications arise as King Leonides prepares to face the invading horde.  A member of the Spartan Council, in the pay of the Persians, prevents him from taking the Spartan Army to seize and hold a key piece of terrain at Thermopylae (the ""Hot Gates""), a narrow pass.  Leonides instead takes 300 picked warriors, knowing his mission is likely suicidal but believing the time gained in slowing down the Persians is necessary to rally the Greeks.The stand by the ""300"" at the ""Hot Gates"" is dramatic, epic, and incredibly gory, but also a rousing display of defiance by the free warriors of Sparta and their allies against a Persian Army composed of slaves.Some highlights of the movie: the voice-over narration by the surviving member of Leonides' small force, without which some aspects of the Greek culture might seem opaque; the brotherhood unto death of the Spartan warriors; the excellent performance by Lena Headey as Leonides' spouse, equal parts loving wife and tough-minded queen; and the dramatic landscapes and special effects made possible by the overlay of animation on real actors.A few quibbles: The Persians are rendered as vaguely African in appearence; the blood and gore almost overwhelm the storyline at times; and the too-easy departure from the standard telling of this semi-legendary event.  The decisive Greek victory over the Persians at Platea that followed Thermopylae is almost an afterthought.This movie is highly recommended to those with an interest in a remarkable, graphically original rendering of an ancient story with a moral still valid for the present day."	4.0	A Legend Refreshed...	2007-09-09	5	4	1

I admit it took awhile to get it's hold on me because the beginning was a bit dull.  For some reason I had a hard time understanding what was being said or going on so I had to turn on the subtitles.  Maybe I'm just getting old lol.  But this movie was good.  Even the special features were interesting and the clip about the history of the movie and how it was based on true events.The movie is priced pretty low and it's blu ray so go ahead and pick it up.  An inexpensive addition to your blu ray collection and a very good movie.  No regrets.  May not be suitable for kids tho.  Some pretty bloody scenes and some adult content as well.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"Even if it's probably exaggerated, the story is still an inspiring one -- a mere three hundred Spartans who repelled a massive invasion.And the adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel ""300"" is a stunning one -- literally stunning, since it bombards the viewer with larger-than-life characters, smashing visuals and tight direction. It goes a bit too fast for its own good, but it's a truly epic film that takes the historical war movie to another level -- all the more so because it actually happened.As the introduction tells us, the Spartans were the ultimate warrior people. Babies were inspected for weakness or faults, and killed if they had any; as they were growing up, they were taught and toughened by a savage regimen. Their only true hope was to ""die beautifully"" for their land.A Persian messenger arrives, telling King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) that the god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) wants the Spartans to bow to him. Leonidas' response: shove the Persians into a pit. But before he can go to war, he must consult the corrupt priesthood of Ephors and their beautiful Oracle. She predicts that Sparta will fall and the gods forbid war at the approach of the Carneaian festival -- courtesy of a hefty bribe from a Spartan traitor.So Leonidas takes out three hundred of his best men, along with their nervy Arcadian allies, and begin trouncing the Persians. But they are being sabotaged, both by a hunchbacked outcast and by a treacherous councilor, whom Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is battling. And so at Thermopylae, Leonidas prepares for a final battle against the monstrous Persian Army -- knowing that their story of freedom will live on.This is not a ""sensitive"" movie where you have any appreciation for the bad guys -- it's a glorification of three hundred soldiers who died for their land and freedom. It just wouldn't work otherwise. It doesn't blindly adore the Spartans -- we see their darker side in their ""weed out the weak"" policy -- but it does appreciate them. They respect and care about each other, and Leonidas is as kind as he can be even to Ephialtes, the traitor.And it's done in a manner appropriate to its comic book origins -- grimy, bloody and epic, but with a stylized look that is almost like CGI. The battles are shockingly good, and full of fantasy-ish creations like the monstrous creatures or the silver-masked Immortals. Even a wall of corpses. But we also get some beautiful visuals as well -- roiling seas, sunlit battlefields, Spartan cities, and the drugged Oracle in her white veil.While the script gets a bit over-the-top at times, it's hard not to be moved by dialogue that can be darkly funny (""It's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare"") or stirring (""He did not wish tribute, nor song, or monuments or poems of war and valor. His wish was simple: ""Remember us."" That was his hope, should any free soul come across that place, in all the countless centuries yet to be"").Butler and Headey are simply great as Leonidas and Gorgo -- they're both strong, passionate and fearless, and they both do a great job in their separate storylines. But the movie is filled with good performances -- David Wenham as the narrator, Dominic West, Michael Fassbender, Santoro as the decadent, arrogant god-king, and many others.""300"" is a unique, stirring, stunning movie that pushes the action-movie envelope, and gives a thrilling edge to a real-life story of overwhelming power. A brilliant movie."	4.0	This is SPARTA!	2013-03-30	2	0	2
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1PY4BCMI543EX	E. Barrios	After watching this movie the other day, I have to say it left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm funny about Hollywood messing around with ancient history so you may not want to use me as a guide for this review of 300.Miller has talent. I don't think many would dispute that claim. However, his talent lies in his original material such as Sin City and not his bent on classical history, for example. I found it difficult to suspend disbelief when I saw the scene with the Delphic Oracle or the various creatures throughout the film.I will say the battle scenes are well done and the acting is pretty decent which is why I decided to give this three stars instead of two.In the end, Miller is better off sticking to what he knows and should not venture too far from his area of expertise. My Greek and Roman Tragedy professor even liked it. Like I said, I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to things historical so don't go by me. But, play it safe and watch this as a rental.Thanks.	3.0	Could've been Better	2007-03-30	7	2	5

Meanwhile the coloring and texture of the film itself lends the story an amazing setting somewhere between a glorfied fantasy story of the 1940 film era and a modern kung fu action movie.  With hazy colouring, sepia tone, and freeze frame action sequences.This movie was a sheer delight filled with freaks, amazing fighting and tons of gorey bloodshed.  And to back up all those joys this movie also has amazing cinemetography and an interesting story line.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AT6CZDCP4TRGA	Eduarrdo Nietzsche	"...so what?  Tremendous fun and absorbing eye-candy, nonetheless.I went to see this film with very low expectations, just wanted some nice mindless escapist entertainment for a change (my tastes in film usually run towards indies, art-house foreign flicks and dramas), and it delivered in spades.For one thing, I didn't expect to see so much yummy-exquisite female nudity, as provided by the pubescent girl (17? 18?) who plays the Oracle and by Queen Gorgos (perhaps ""Queen Gorgeous"" would've been a better name, mama mia!).  The battle scenes were relentlessly entertaining and at turns unintentionally funny in just how overdone and hyperbolic they were.  Could've used a bit more black humor though, the only bit of it I remember was when the Spartans were killing off the wounded Persians while engaging in droll conversation.Now for the Cheese-Whiz, which I could have done without:1.  The hopelessly pompous voice-over narration.  Ugh, the man sounded like a cross between Charleton Heston pimping for the National Rifle Association and some Fox News wingnut moron.  Even cheesier than the purple narrator of ""Saving Private Ryan!""2.  The jingoistic/nationalistic cow droppings: parts of this script could have been lifted straight from some Homeland Security, Republican Party, or GW Bush talking points.  Especially when Queen Gorgos tells the Spartan council that ""Freedom isn't always free""--- gag! cough! Sieg Heil!!!3.  The shameless rip-offs from ""Gladiator:"" Leonidas has more than a passing resemblance to Russell Crowe; Lena Headey (Queen Gorgos) is the spitting image of Connie Nielsen (the emperor's sister in ""Gladiator""); and especially the sepia-toned images of lush wheat fields swaying in the wind while accompanied by Enya-like music.4.  Some of the dialogue was pretty bad, not just the jingoistic bits mentioned above but also any Deep Emotional Moments which simply underscored the limitations of the cast and script.5.  Some of the battle scenes were afflicted by speed-metal guitar riffs, which made the male-teenager-focused video-game nature of this movie way too obvious and annoying.But despite its flaws (many more flaws than Miller's ""Sin City"" btw) the sheer visual quality of this film still made it a thoroughly enjoyable experience despite the fact that yes it would make a great recruiting film for ANY military institution.  The violence was actually not anywhere as gruesome as I expected, probably because the battle scenes were so heavily computer-generated; I found the battle scenes of ""Rob Roy"" and ""Braveheart"" for example to be much more gory.PS.  I did a Google search for ""history of Sparta"" and found out many very interesting things.  Most interesting is that Sparta was indeed an oligarchical slave state and a deeply rigid and repressive totalitarian one at that, NOT the brave democracy that this film might lead you to believe, with all the GW Bush-like twaddle about ""freedom"" and ""free men""---or is there a hidden irony in that parallel?  We Americans eat up all of our government's propaganda telling us how wonderfully free and democratic our nation is, and this is true only relative to countries like North Korea and Cuba, but beyond those extremes, when compared to say Sweden or Canada or Germany the US is really best described as a corporate plutocracy that happens to be very adept at manufacturing consent on the part of its citizens for this status quo."	5.0	yeah, it's Hyper-Testosterone topped with Cheese-whiz, but...	2007-04-01	0	0	0
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"In 480 B.C., the Battle of Thermopylae was a precursor of the more familiar Battle of the Alamo in 1836. Both were examples of how a small battalion of men was able to fend off a much larger army by a combination of resourcefulness, fortitude and sheer will. However, the scale of Thermopylae was far more dramatic as 300 Spartans under King Leonidas held at bay for three days over a quarter million Persians under Xerxes the Great. Directed with technical flourish by Zack Snyder, this visually elaborate 2007 action film is a fictionalized retelling of that momentous event as it was vividly envisioned in Frank Miller's1999 graphic novel. Similar to the 2005 adaptation of Miller'sSin City, a constant parade of striking, often gory images is what drives the momentum of the screenplay co-written by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad and Michael P. Gordon. However, unlike that story and more similarly, Ridley Scott'sGladiator, a coherent narrative flow and a more involving sense of character development are lacking to a significant degree.The net result is a stylish piece of juvenile pop entertainment but hardly more substantive than a typical Italian sword-and-sandal picture from the early 1960's. Things start promisingly as we are presented with a cursory overview of Leonidas' fate as King of Sparta when he is separated from his mother at age seven to undergo the rigorous training necessary to have the courage and bloodlust of a true leader. The problem is that Snyder keeps painting the story's mythological aspects with broader and broader brushstrokes. Dialogue takes on a contemporary, almost comical tone that makes it difficult to take seriously the gravity of the events depicted. The battle scenes, especially an overindulgent use of slow motion, are equally outlandish with the gore so exaggerated and figures so grotesque (like the Uber-Immortal) that it makes it difficult to understand or even care about the motivations behind the characters' actions. Everything is larger than life and so lacking in detail and nuance that all the actors can do is accommodate the over-stylized treatment.The pumped-up, half-clothed bodies match up well with the comic book sensibilities on display here, chief among them Gerard Butler, who is ideally cast as Leonidas. It's not a complex role, but even with his distinctively Scottish brogue, he has no problem showcasing the nobility, stubbornness and mocking cockiness necessary to be leading such an audaciously fatalistic military strategy. Made up like a bejeweled NY-glam boy, Rodrigo Santoro seems less than a match for the commanding Leonidas as the seemingly omnipotent, seven-foot Xerxes. Better is Lena Headey as the Spartan queen Gorgo, whose devotion to Leonidas goes unabated in home front scenes, where she has to fend off the advances of the dastardly Theron while begging the state council to send more troops. The rest of the cast really doesn't register much beyond the epic film stereotypes they are playing, including David Wenham's obligatory turn as the narrator Dilios. It takes a certain artistry to provide grace and power to a story mythologized from a real event, but it appears most of the filmmakers' efforts lie on the surface.The two-disc 2007 DVD package should make fans palpitate with glee. Disc One has the best extra - the constantly informative commentary track from Snyder with periodic contributions from Johnstad and director of photography Larry Fong. There is no doubt Snyder did a lot of research, and he is extremely forthcoming with the behind-the-scenes details, which in this case, is very helpful. Disc Two contains a lot of small extras, the most prominent being the mostly intriguing 24-minute ""300 Spartans: Fact or Fiction?"", in which Miller, Snyder and historians discuss the painstaking detail as well as the liberties taken with this interpretation of the actual battle. Another historically oriented short and a brief making-of featurette are also included, as well as a quick short on the translation of the blue-screen images. Miller is interviewed separately in one fifteen-minute piece, and there is a multi-chapter Web production diary, which seems to be a more common feature on DVD sets these days."	3.0	Unleashing a Massive Load of Testosterone in a Fancifully Gory Version of a Real-Life Battle	2008-02-19	5	4	1

There's fighting, there's more fighting, and still more fighting.  Which doesn't give the viewer any opportunity for emotional involvement.  Or watching the character develop as the story progresses.  The characters are flat and one-dimensional and that is my biggest complaint.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1TOH8S8I1VT9R	"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real"""	"I've waited a long time before watching this film (to the point that this review is mostly irrelevant).  As a history fan, I needed to take some time to separate what I know about Thermopylae from the Frank Miller comic book.  I knew that if I viewed this film as anything other than a ""fantasy"" film I had no chance of enjoying it.  So, my mind-set is adjusted, my sense of history is checked at the door.  I'm ready to watch a mindless action ""epic"".  I actually bought the DVD so that I was invested in enjoying this film (I.E;"" I hope I did not waste my money"" therefore ""I hope I enjoy this"").Well, thankfully I bought it on sale.  As hard as I tried, I did not enjoy it as much as so many other people did.  I can't deny that lurking historical facts were leeching out of my ""pragmatic"" brain into my ""pleasure"" brain.  So take that for what it's worth.  But I still managed to watch it mostly as its own story.  I believe that if the terms; Greek, Spartans, Persians, Thermopylae, Leonidas and Xerxes had been omitted from this film and replaced with; Wooshnicks, Furbees, Gargoyles, Narrow Pass, Studly and Pierce I could have completely separated the history from the fantasy.  That's my problem; understood.  However, I often found myself laughing when I wasn't supposed to, snickering at some unconvincing Special FX and overall, not buying into this surreal fantasy.  That's the film makers' problem.In my ever futile attempt to write a shorter review, here are a bunch of categorized vignettes to clarify what I saw while watching this DVD:PS; I can't guarantee ""no spoilers"" but if I think it is I'll give one of these; #-THE VIOLENCEI have no problem with violence in film.  Since this film is primarily about a specific BATTLE it really is the focal point of the film.  BOY IS IT THE FOCAL POINT!  Unfortunately this is one of the things I snickered at.  The goal was clearly to recreate comic book-like action poses; mission accomplished.  Every time a cool pose is achieved the action slows down so we can get a nice look, then it speeds up again so we can get to the next cool pose.  Sometimes this was cool.  Sometimes this was tedious.  I liked the way I could see how the warriors killing ballet worked out, but I was longing for a sense of the action in real time.  The only time I felt the weight of the Persian's numbers was in the initial melee.-THE NUDITYI have no problem with nudity in film.  I don't own any pornography but this is the closest thing I have next to ""Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n"".  Though there are no genital shown you get to see everything else.  The one big sex scene seemed really jammed into place.  I had trouble figuring out why it was there (other than obvious marketing reasons).  Also, the scene of Xerxes tent was just bizarre.  Xerxes decadence was almost ridiculous.  He had half naked women squirming about, even standing in one spot (just standing there, wiggling), and several reject Cenobites from the ""Hellraiser"" films.  Also, body piercing and body chains are sure signs of evil for some reason (bondage?).  However, this scene served more of a purpose than the big Leonidas sex scene.-THE STORYWell, don't get me going on ""History"".  In my opinion, the ""real"" story of Thermopylae is a more complex and enthralling tale than this fantasy.  That said; this story as a fantasy could have been so much better.  Get rid of the queen; useless.  Get rid of the politics; pointless.  Get rid of the awful narration by Van Helsing's sidekick monk; because that's what he sounded like (it's the same guy FYI).  Since historical accuracy is not the point in this film, quit trying to explain everything.  I'd buy into it more then.  I have no problem with a shallow story about a battle; that would be great.  I thought most of the story elements in this film that were not the battle were extraneous.-VISUALSNow this is what gets people interested in these types of movies, right?  If the goal was to recreate the look and feel of the comic; mission accomplished again.  From what little I've seen of the comic, I'd have to say they hit the mark.  Unfortunately I did not like that look translated to film.  It was well done but I had a key problem with this; this is a live action motion picture, not a comic book.  When I watch a movie (fantasy or otherwise) no matter how surreal or fantastic the environment, I want to believe I'm there.  I always felt like I was in a green room with computer FX surrounding me.  Also, since so very often swords and spears would impale people, CGI was used to create the ""other end"" of the weapons coming out the bodies.  But often the trajectory of the ""in"" side of the weapon did not seem to line up with the ""out"" side of the weapon.  I don't know if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but something did not look right.  Lastly, the blood being copious (comic book style) was also CGI.  I've no problem with this fundamentally, but often it looked unnatural or painted in.  I can't buy into the fantasy if the blood looks fake; sorry.-THE ACTINGHey, what does it take to shout ""SPAR-TA!!"" and ""WHOOT!"" But seriously, as a hyper-drama the actors were asked to act hyper-dramatically.  Everyone did a decent job accept Faramir (David Wenham).  His character voice was inexplicably the same voice he used in ""Van Helsing"" which is not much like his ""Farimir"" voice.  I actually had a hard time not imagining him in his monk's costume.  He was not the worst actor but he did seem out of place.  There was some bad acting in this but it was limited to minor players (or the directors fault?).-LITTLE THINGS THAT BUGGED ME#When Leonidas explains to Quasimodo the requirements for fighting like a Spartan, he describes the Greek Phalanx.  Since Quasi can't stand erect, he can't raise his shield to defend his mates.  The King was very cordial to Quasi.  Quasi still was not happy.  When the fighting begins the phalanx is employed and the Persians receive the subsequent piercing.  But wait. Leonidas soon forgets this unfailing tactic and resumes later melees in open order, mano-a-mano combat.  Quasi!! Come back!!! You can fight!  This made The King look disingenuous.  Another annoyance; I have real trouble with massive armies sending their soldiers in sequence to fight one on one (like in Kung Fu movies).  Granted, they come fast in this movie, but rarely do they do what most would if given the opportunity; surround the exposed guy with 10 guys and attack at once.  Since the Spartans were not in Phalanx most of the time, this is what would have happened.-MONSTERS #Here's where I knew I had some level of success separating the history from the comic book.  I honestly had no problem with Rhinos and Elephants showing up at Thermopylae; it never happened but so what.  I had no problem with Xerxes' Cenobites or his giant ogre guy.  Heck, I had very little trouble with Xerxes being a transsexual giant.  I understood the attempt at clarifying good and evil (there's a whole lot wrong with this but I'm not going there).  I thought Quasi was a pretty clever idea.  As a rejected/rescued Spartan baby reared as a Spartan in seclusion, this character, in the context of a fantasy, made a lot of sense.  The only ""monster"" that bothered me was the ""Orc"" immortals.  What was that all about?  Everything else seemed to fit in a weird way except the ""orcmortals"".-THE DVDI bought the one disc version so I didn't get any extras at all; kind of cheep when you think about it.  Most one disc versions have, at least, a couple of extras.  Sound and picture are good enough.Well, I failed again at being brief.  Watching this film and evaluating how I felt about it were a little more complex than I thought (since this is a pretty simple film).  I clearly did not hate it (once my mind was in the right context) but I did not think it was well enough executed to garner exalted status either.  Overall it was a little (well actually, A LOT) too hyper dramatic for me to take seriously.  The posing and shouting of lines, the creatures and unconvincing visuals (intended as surreal or otherwise) came off as somewhat goofy to me (like a few other comic book movies I've seen).  I don't think that's what the film makers were going for.  I know I'm in the minority, but if you have the same mind-set as me (you like to believe what you are watching for 2 to 3 hours) you might not think this is so great either.  It's sort of fun but not in the way I was expecting or hoping."	3.0	300 Furbees vs. Orcs; Even viewed in the proper context, it's definitely not perfect.	2007-03-06	1	1	0

The production values are amazing.  The actors are talented and believable, and not all are familiar faces although I expect to see more of them!  The script is powerful, and the Spartans face an ethical challenge.  Their creed - Never Retreat, Never Surrender - for the Spartan community of all free men, is ingrained from childhood.  All the Persians want is for the Spartans to kneel to their rule.  The Spartans will be granted wealth, power and leadership, in exchange for a bow to the Persian King.  The Persians did not consider that Spartans value honor above all else, and cannot be bribed or cowed into submission, even facing overwhelming forces.  Their battle is poignant and inspiringly courageous.  The Spartans kept their honor, lifestyle and ethics at the price of their lives, and are a shining example of integrity. The wives lovingly say goodbye to their husbands - with the phrase ""return with your sheild, or on it"" - which is a vote of confidence and pride in their men.

Because being politically correct isn't a movie's job. Plain and simple. If that were so then every bit of degrading the Native Americans by the US Army must be taken out of the family show ""Dr. Quinn - Medicine Woman"". Audiences are intelligent enough to realize that this is a movie based on a graphic novel, not an accurate depiction of what actually happened. To cite another example: If 300 is a so ""racist"" then all the contra English undertones must be edited out of ""Braveheart"". Yes, it's that simple!The movie itself is a stunning piece of art. I originally watched it because I'm a fan of its leading man, Gerard Butler, but I was floored by the entire cast and the entire movie. Gerard Butler shines as Leonidas and his fierce outcry ""Spartans, tonight we dine IN HELL!"" is already a classic. It's a movie about heroes and sacrifice, about magic and war, about love and loss. All of which is presented with gritty realism and yet artificial polish. The action scenes are eye candy and the fangirl in me couldn't help but enjoy the...view....of Butler an his warriors dressed in codpieces and capes, HOT darn it!It's amazing entertainment done well by everyone involved.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1CHOKV10NEI8X	"E. M. Van Court ""Van"""	"But in a good way!This is ""300"", a movie adaptation of a comic book version of a historical event.  This movie cannot fairly be critiqued from a single perspective, so I'll look at it from several.As history: Not as bad as the most vocal critics would have you think, but consider it an inspiration to read about the actual events rather than a history of the events (unlike the old ""I, Claudius"" series, which had only a couple of historical errors).  ""300"" mentions most of the key events around the battle of Thermopylae.  Then the history goes downhill fast.  The costumes, the weapons, the armor, the role and nature of the Ephors, the terrain of Greece, the ships, and numerous other elements detract from the historical accuracy of the movie.  But this doesn't keep it from being a good movie, just don't watch it before that big history test.Visually: Overwhelming!  Miller's imagery presents very well on the big screen through Zack Snyder's direction.  It's from a comic book, so everything is larger than life.  The use of color was brilliant, and shapes the mood of the viewer with remarkable grace.  This movie overwhelms with vignettes of image, each more powerful than the last.  I was particularly impressed by the imagery of the Spartan phalanx, capturing the power, beauty, and lethality of a coordinated team that has been trained and forged into a whole greater than the sum of its parts.  On the other hand, I think Zack Synder is trying to do for American men what the fashion industry has done for American women (when I'm done typing, I need to do about 10,000 ab crunches, sit-ups, and flutterkicks).As a story (apart from history): Brilliant!  It's a story of a man forced to decide between his desires, the duties of his office, the laws of his land, and the future of his country (and of the world; had Leonidas and his comrades not fought at the hot gates, Persia would have shaped the world very differently than the inspiration of Classical Greece did).  Not an easy decision, and the factors shaping the decision are developed beautifully, and how the story of Leonidas and the 300 heros of Thermopylae shaped later events is mentioned at the end of the movie.  This story is well told.  It is also the story of Queen Gorgo, and one of the few cultures of the time that treated women with the respect they deserve.  Sparta was the only Greek culture of that time where woman could be heard openly in political discussion, and had greater equality than in any other Greek city (and MUCH better treatment than in Persia).  Ironic that in every other way, Sparta was the least liberal city of Greece.  The Queen was a powerful woman of integrity, and the treatment of her piece of 300 is respectful, well told, and shows the whole woman.  Congratulations to Lena Headey for a job well done!As having current, real-world impact:  I am amused.  The President of Iran's response to this movie is very telling.  Iran is what was Persia, and the majority of Iran are ethnic Persians.  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad voiced complaints about this movie, that it portrayed Persians in a negative light, that it was propaganda a psychological warfare, and demanded that the U.S. government do something.  (Like anyone in Hollywood would do any thing for the Executive Branch these days.)  It's from a comic book!  This is as silly as China's complaints about Disney's ""Mulan""!  Oh, by the way, the U.S. government doesn't control the movie industry, but Ahmadinejad clearly thinks it does.  But maybe Ahmadinejad was offended by a movie that had woman having a voice in a nation's policy.  Maybe he was offended by exhortations to stand up against tyrants, for freedom, the future, and the hope that (Greek) democracy brought to the world.  Maybe he was upset by the comicbook presentation of Xerxes.  Still, regardless of the reason, his demands to suppress the arts speak volumes about his vision for Iran and the world.Nah, he was just upset that someone reminded the world that guys in pajamas (Persian trousers) were beaten by guys in skirts.As a source for leadership vignettes: pretty darned good.  The single best one is in the dialog between Leonidas and Xerxes, as they discuss the roles of leaders and followers, but Leonidas' talk with hunchbacked shepard who wished to fight alongside the Greeks, and the final monolog have much to offer also.There have been frequent criticisms of the way ""300"" presents the human figure, alleging that the film is soft-core homoerotic porn.  Critics shouldn't be so narrow.  If ""300"" is any kind of soft-core porn, it is pretty even-handed and diverse in its nature, especially in Xerxes' tents.  The movie is not for kids, and not for adults offended by human bodies or sexuality.In all, I enjoyed ""300"" and was moved by the final scene, where the entire story is placed in context by the narrator.  As a bit of a historian, I couldn't give it the fifth star, but that wasn't easy as I believe it captures the spirit of the Greek side of the Battle of Thermopylae well, despite uncounted historical inaccuracies and fabrications.  It's not for everyone, but it is very good for what it is."	4.0	This isn't history, this is madness!	2007-08-03	46	37	9
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2HLD01ITWC6CJ	"Enrique Pilazzo ""Enrique Pilazzo"""	"OK, so the title of this review comprises about 95% of the dialogue of the movie. It was one continuous uproar of men grunting, screaming, beating their chests, waiving swords in the air, and directing general carnage. On top of that, the movie was shamelessly racist, showing every Spartan as model-sculpted, ripped young men and women, spouting the virtues of freedom, democracy, etc. Contrast that with the evil, diminuitive, scarred, and grotesque enemies from the ""east"" (although looking oddly-similar to the middle east) who were slaves, bound, and craven.So, all of that being said, why did I rate this movie a 4??? Because it's one heck of a ride! OK, so it goes over the top several times, but the battles are huge and blood-pounding, the nude women are hot (and yes, that does make a difference), and there will always remain something primal in every man that courts to this type of bloodshed and mayhem.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2Y5730TRGTZA0	Eric	This highly stylized re-telling of the Battle of Thermoplyae, takes you into the darker side of that historical conflict. Frank Miller (the world's oldest 15-year old) uses his unique and rather bleak world-view as a focusing lens for his latest film. The Spartans are called upon to hold off the largest army the world has ever seen, and after an epic battle, they are killed to a man (no spoilers here, the story is over 2,000 years old).

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A10I199V8AAHW8	"Eric Husher ""The Searat"""	There is no point discussing this film in terms of history or historical accuracy, since there is no attempt made, or intended to make this film have anything to do with reality (and if I go down that road in this review I would have to write a book!).  That is obviously not the remit of this film! In fact, the characters of this film really don't have to be Greek, or Persian, but could be Elves and Orcs, or any other mythical creatures you might care to summon up for that matter.  Call 'em all 'wombats' if that makes it politically/historically correct for you! Nor is there any great 'message' involved, any more than there is some intended message in a round of 'Grand Theft Auto,' or any of the other more sophisticated video games.  Not much of a plotline either, except as a simple vehicle to get the characters to fight in a well-defined space (also suitable for video games!).So, with all that put to one side, really, all there is left is to discuss the film on its technical merits as an essentially animated film, and as an animated film, there is not much point in examining the 'acting' either, since acting really requires a live subject on film, and anything else is just 'voice overs.'  The animation technique used in this film reminds me of 'Lord of the Rings' as done by Ralph Bakshi many years ago, and although obviously upgraded through technology (CGI), the effect is still a bit unsettling, as 'live action' film and animation (CGI, in this case) still don't blend together well, though they can work well side by side.In sum, I view this film as an interesting technological experiment in working with computers, possibly with good applications in future video games, and/or adjuncts to future films.  And as such, it's a pretty good cartoon (I particularly liked the 3-D ending credits).  As a film, with a believable plot, believable dialog, interesting character development, etc, etc, it's pretty much a bust!	2.0	Not bad for a cartoon....	2008-07-14	7	4	3

It was full of actor interviews and special features on how the whole production came together which deserves Academy Award recognition for creativity at the very least.  I was amazed at the Frank Miller's amazing vision and how he created this cinema production and CGI effects which tricks our eyes into seeing a much greater scope of bigger-than-life action and scenery.  I adore Gerard Butler's expressive voice and eyes and how he commands the story with his convincing role as King Leonidas.  Plus, all the actors/Spartans warriors' physiques are the real deal!  Watch the special feature on the bodybuilding and how the actors had to learn real fighting techniques and over 6 months of grueling physical training to get into those little leather loincloths--of course, well worth the result when you watch the fight sequences.  Of course, the movie has its legend bending qualities, but the point of entertainment is to leave some of that skeptical sense of Discovery Channel accuracy/fact checking at the door and sit down and just enjoy the show.  So just do it.  It's worth the money and then some!!	5.0	300 DVD - Spartans are Invincible	2007-08-27	0	0	0

Berry	This review will not speak to Director Zach Snyder's excellent handling of the superb (Frank Miller graphic novel) source material, nor will it speak to the tremendous job done by the cast of highly skilled, excellent actors.Rather, my intended purpose is to briefly describe the movie experience after having watched/ heard it on blu-ray and in uncompressed 5.1 PCM surround sound.  One word: brilliant.Video: I have no idea what many reviewers here refer to when they say the blu-ray version is, visually, no better than, or on par with the DVD version.  This is simply not the case.The blu-ray version, visually speaking, outshines the DVD version by far; the level of depth, color, contrast,and overall tonal quality is spectacular.  Every environment in the film, while intensely stylized and computer-generated, is not *obviously* computer-generated.  In fact, nearly every scene looks like a perfect melding of a fantastic painting and reality, but visually leaning moreso towards reality.Audio: As cliche as it sounds (so to speak), this soundtrack has to be heard (on the proper equipment) to be believed.  The score is sweeping and majestic, the dialogue is pinpoint tight in it's aural focus and delivery, and the battle scenes deliver a brutally visceral audio impact so intense it made this reviewer shriek and gleefully erupt like a little Spartan girl (which is incredible, given that the reviewer is actually a little boy, and not a Spartan).Do yoursef a favor and pick up this movie right away, but play it only AFTER you've acquired and had properly set-up: a 1080P HDTV, an amplifier capable of decoding and/or playing back the movie's 5.1 uncompressed soundtrack, and a decent 5.1 (or better) speaker setup.Now, sit back with some popcorn (or some gyros), and ENJOY!	5.0	Short Review of The Audio and Visual Aspects of 300	2008-09-05	3	3	0

The action scenes are shot with great skill and the computer generation is up to date. The message is most important. You will learn that society should be based on fear of others, on glorification of violence, on hatred, rage, and on killing. You will learn that ""freedom"" means personal honor rather than responsibility toward others. You will learn that arrogance is maturity. You will learn that a great person is one who kills without warning or reason and a great nation is a nation that destroys and dominates other nations. You will learn that everything should be sacrificed to the military and to war; that war is the highest purpose of a nation and a people. You will see the total perversion of the ideals that motivated Jefferson, Washington, Adams, and the other founders, who most feared empire, and who tried hard to design a society that could not be corrupted by war as this one has. You will see propaganda worthy of Hitler and Mussolini, who also commissioned art like this.

Hopson ""StarWatcher"""	"First off I want to say that I enjoyed this movie very much and I was completely entertained, and that's why I go to the movies after all, is to be entertained.  And yes, ""300"" is visually stunning, however, I felt like I was watching a CGI video game. Granted the remarks made by so many reviewers here hailing the film as ""art comes to life"" as the screen images are totally CGI generated to perfection, is aptly put, but the CGI sets, scenery, and even characters give the film too much of an artificial feel.  I believe that many of the critics that bashed this film did so due to the fact that the ""artsy"" look of the film takes away from the human realism of the movie's characters.  It's as though computer generated characters could have played all of the parts of the film and you would still have the same end results- ""art comes to life.""  The ""hunchback"" Spartan that wanted to walk in his Father's shoes and die for his King is completely computer generated, but he still puts in a stellar performance!  The Persian War-God , King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) that has the height of a true giant, and the hands the size of a car's hubcaps is totally awesome. But I kept asking myself each time he appeared in the movie, is this guy real or CGI?  I also couldn't help but wonder if the perfect psychics of the Spartan Warriors were completely the men themselves or if they had some CGI assistance with those perfect tans and abs?  There are aspects of the story itself that are somewhat doubtful, such as the beginning where Leonidas is being raised as a ""true Spartan"" warrior, who is taught to have no feelings, no mercy, and no compassion.  A child taught these things would not grow up into adulthood as a Great King or even a person that anyone would want to be around.  This type of content is not something you would want your young kids to be subjected to, especially in today's society. Even though the content is staying true to the graphic novel.  However, this film is not about today's society or the modern world in which we live.  And young kids shouldn't be seeing an ""R"" rated movie in the first place. This movie is about Ancient Greece and the society in which these people lived and how they had to fight to keep their civilization, as well as their lives.  The film achieves it's goal by catching it's audience's attention from the very beginning and holding it to the very end.These are just a few feelings that I had concerning the movie, and is why many of us write ""reviews"" in the first place. To share our experience of a particular film, whether good or bad, and to recommend seeing it or avoiding it.  I highly recommend seeing this movie to fans of similar movies such as, ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and Colin Farrell's ""Alexander,"" which takes the viewer on a fantastic journey into the world of the real and the unreal.  And these same fans should definitely add ""300"" to their DVD libraries.  Again I truly enjoyed this film; however, I didn't let my enthusiasm and total enjoyment of the CGI magic blind my sight of its flaws.  And the one flaw being the immense lack of human character and the distant observation of these historic characters which never allows the viewer to feel that they relate to them whatsoever.  They're like characters from a ""video game"" that you totally cheer for, but never really care about.  Bravo to the special effects crews, who without them, this film would look like something from either late 1950's Hollywood or today's History Channel.  I'm pleased to have ""300"" sitting perfectly next to Brad Pit's ""Troy,"" Russell Crow's ""Gladiator,"" and Colin Farrell's ""Alexander"" in my DVD library!"	4.0	Spartans!

Just think  WWE Smackdown combined with Gladiator minus credibility or depth. There is plenty of eye candy for those who enjoy gratuitous slow-motion violence (a la The Matrix) with rock-blaring soundtracks in the background and scantily clad warriors and women in erotic, albeit, pointless sex scenes. I'm not squeamish about violence and I love rock, but sometimes you have to call a spade a spade, and, although the film is based on a ""graphic novel"", the scenes here are just overblown, cartoonish and cheesy. It's just the kind of movie that does well at the box office and that the masses eat up and praise vehemently.It's hard to decide what irked me most, the dialogue's stupidity, the lacking characterization, or the film's length (a shade under two hours). Let's start with characters, or lack thereof. There are virtually no characters that anyone could care less about in this film. The main character, Leonidas (Gerard Butler), leads his Spartan warriors into the Battle of Thermopylae, gives long winded, poetic, war speech after war speech to his comrades and there are no redeeming qualities to him, nothing to make you want to care what happens to him or his men. There is way too much of an effort to make one side the ""good"" guys and one side the ""bad"" guys. Too much over-simplication. The enemies are depicted as almost being ""monsterish"" at times, as if the producer wants you to side with the Spartans so much by making the Persians disgusting or vile. They try way too hard to get you to sympathize with Spartans as great warriors and ""real men"" by selling all this ""blah blah blah"" war-lingo in which Leonidas basically says ""We're bad. We're better than them. We're going to take them down. This is the most glorious fight ever"" and on and on. The movie was also too long; it really could have been trimmed by at least twenty to thirty minutes without the oversimplified, drawn-out battles.As much as this film was a disappointment, I can commend Zach Snyder on some positives: the visual effects are decent, and the attempt at originality is there. There is a strong attempt to make this story come to life visually and artistically the way it was written. There is just too much emphasis on this, though.  Too bad the story was stripped down (literally, figuratively) to its bare essentials.All style, all flash, all hype. No substance.Entertainment for entertainment's sake: that's about it.

Those with an interest in Art Direction and Cinematography will have plenty to keep them interested.  The action is beautifully filmed - and you CAN describe these bloody sequences as beautiful.  The attention to detail in following the source Frank Miller comic is striking, and the team succeeded in their stated intent to ""bring the book to life"".  This film stands with Blade Runner as a milestone - many future projects will use what 300 has brought to the table from a visual perspective.As a former Army sergeant, I greatly appreciated the movie's treatment of the soldiers that make the march.  The camraderie is genuine, and informs the performances of the actors involved in the battle sequences in a way I haven't seen since Saving Private Ryan.  There is also a tremendous weight placed on the perception of events from the Spartan point of view.  The fanciful nature of many of the creatures encountered during the battle made a-lot of sense to me - your eyes deceive you in battle.The greatest strength of this film is also it's greatest weakness.  The slavish attention to detail that brings so much to the table visually falls far short in the narrative - which is to be expected in an adaptation of a graphic novel.  However, as a movie with a screenwriting team, there was an opportunity to either a) spend more time with the troops in the field and learn more about what makes them tick or b) provide greater insight into the political turmoil that faced all of Greece during the Persian invasion.  Instead, we get half of both.All things considered, however, I take this for what it is - a beautifully filmed and unusually crafted war film.

Frank Miller's graphic novel based on the ancient event was not about the historical accuracy. It was about an entertaining story, as Miller described,""the best damn story I've ever gotten my hands on"" and impressive, arresting visual style. You would think these are more then enough to make an entertaining epic action flick. Well, not exactly. I really wanted to like the movie and I did not expect much but it became boring very soon along with its visual style, slow motion, and even lot (300 as the title suggests) of nearly naked gorgeous hunks who were certainly the feast for eyes with their 6 pack abs and tight leather underwear but not for ears or brains. I am all for fun and entertainment. I love action movies, I am a fan of Comic books adaptations - many  entertaining movies were successfully adapted from the comic books.

What makes 300 so dire isn't that it is wildly, wildly inaccurate; it is the downright silliness of the whole presentation.  I found it impossible to believe that a bunch of Chippendale strippers with red capes, black bikini underwear, and a total lack of acting expertise would be a barrier to Paris Hilton, much less the hordes of the Persian empire.The film goes so far astray from the facts of the celebrated Battle of Thermopylae that we need hardly mention that event at all; suffice to say that the movie arises from the ""graphic novel"" (i.e. a comic book for the over-21 set) by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley, who did a fanciful riff on the idea of three hundred soliders fighting to their deaths.  By the time it reached the screen, that riff had been mythologized, computerized, colorized, and glamorized to a point at which it feels very much like a low-quality 1960s Japanese cartoon on a hung-over Saturday morning.The story, such as it is, concerns King Leonidas of Sparta (played by the significantly untalented Gerard Butler), who gets ticked off at a Persian messenger, kills him, and thereby more or less precipitates the Greco-Persian War.  After receiving a little T&A; from The Oracle (Kelly Craig) and playing slap-and-tickle with wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), he leads 299 of his best off to the glory of still more CGI and certain death.  Along the way there is a little racism, a little homophobia, and enough of an S&M-ish; edge to make you wonder if Freud might have been onto to something after all.It is all nonsense and ultimately less plausible than CLASH OF THE TITANS, but the real killer is the fact that the whole thing is as slow as molasses in winter.  The pace is deadly dull, and for all the CGI skill on display 300 isn't even clever in terms of cinematography or art design.  There is nothing, absolutely nothing in the least surprising, pulse-pounding, or emotionally or intellectually engaging, or even technically innovative about any of it.This is the sort of film that appeals almost exclusively to the ""Man, that is WAY cool!"" crowd, who will no doubt yak endlessly about pixels while scratching their pimpled cheeks and generally waiting for Quentin Tarantino to make another movie as good as GRINDHOUSE.  But unless you happen to fall into that category, take my advice and don't be suckered.

Both films share a fictional rendition, though ""300"" has a unique visual stamp to its efforts. Adding gratuitous sexcapades for the modern porn-inclined audience was degrading to its dramatic efforts, including the British accents and preposterous ""M-lords"" scattered throughout.Yet the most inventive use of slo-motion in action film to date allowed the viewer to savor the synchronized movements of the brave lads as a unit or separately to absorb the weaponry tailored for the daring close combat.The acting was superior to the daytime soap screenplay;and despite the autodesk re-created Pompeiian town in detail, the film never makes an attempt to wrap the action in historicity. The History channel's ""Last Stand of the 300"" is the real take on this incident."	2.0	For the few, the loud who do not go beyond the realm of Cliff Notes	2007-10-24	5	2	3

The audio and video quality will be unsurpassed by the regular DVD quality and equalled by its Blu Ray counterpart. What makes this better than its Blu Ray counterpart is its extra features that are exclusive to HD DVD. Even better is the fact that the cheapest HD DVD player is $249 on Amazon as compared to the cheapest Blu Ray player which is $500 (probablyabout $450 on Amazon). Also if you have an Xbox 360 you can pick up the HD DVD add-on for only $200, a great deal and hundreds of dollars cheaper than the equivilent Blu Ray version.300 + HD DVD = a GREAT movie.	5.0	300 on HD DVD!

I have just a couple of things I'd like to mention...In response to the negativity surrounding the ""historical accuracy"" of the movie and the way it portrays Persians, I'd like to point out that this movie is a narrative from the point of a Spartan who viewed Persians as the enemy.Just like with any war propaganda, the ""perceived"" enemy is portrayed as the... wait for it.. BAD GUY. That's because, in the eyes of the Spartan narrating the story, he is. Why would the narrator want to portray the bad guys as well rounded, nice, and approachable individuals from a progressive society that is making wonderful... yeah. whatever.I'm not saying that Persians are bad, or that the portrayal was ""right."" I'm saying it was the narrative point of view to the story, and integral to understanding the point of view for the Spartans(in the movie).Also, something to mention- if you like action (good action), and great cinematography, and useful dialog... visual candy, amazing sound, originality, and the feeling that the people making this film actually put some time, and effort into giving a good show, then check it out for yourself.Me, I love this MOVIE!

Urbanas	"""Sometimes reality is too complex for verbal communication but LEGEND embodies it in a form that enables it to spread over the world.""One might say FILM enables HISTORY to be communicated in the form of LEGEND to the movie-going public around the world -- and perhaps some young viewer will be inspired to learn more about the pre-Christian roots of Western culture and tell us how it REALLY happened.Whether '300' becomes in time a classic of blue screen technoloby, a legendary work of cinema art, a cult film for a few forever-adolescent comic book nerds, a morale booster for our military, or a popular blockbuster, I cannot know but there are scenes that will long remain in my memory, just as in 'Gladiator.' What is certain is that '300' replaces Millier's inspiration 'The 300 Spartans' as 'Classic Comics' film history. It surpasses 'Sin City' in its message & 'Gladiator' in its visuals and therefore both as a work of art. Only 'Pan's Labyrinth' does something equivalent in the films of the past year. The critics by and large have gotten it wrong because of their hidebound definition of what film is 'supposed to be.' It is pointless to quibble about characterization, historical accuracy, acting nuance, plot subtlety, displays of flesh and blood, when nearly every visual is as beautiful as one imagines an ancient tragedy to have been for its audience or the images in the minds of listeners when the ancient tales of mythic battles fought on the plains of Troy by mythic heroes were told by bards around the fire circle of a king's megaron. This is as Miller wrote it, a comic book version of history as told by a pop culture story teller, and the details are not important, nor is verisimilitude, because these things exist in the imagination of those who care to listen.But what a tale it is! Hurrah for King Leonidas and his Spartans! May his memory live forever among the all those who fought and died for their land, their city, their homes, their women and children.""And he who so falls among his comrades to lose his sweet life,So blessing with honor his city, his father, and his people,With a wound in his chest, wherein the spear that he faced has transfixedThe massive guard of his shield, and gone clear through his armor too,Why, such a man is lamented by both young and old alike,And all his city goes into mourning and so grieves for his loss.His tomb is pointed to with pride, and so too are all his children,And his children's children, and afterward all the race that's his.His shining glory is never forgotten, his name remembered,And so he becomes an immortal, though he lies under the ground,When he, who was a brave man, has been killed by the furious war god,Standing his ground, fighting hard for his children, his life, and his land."" -- Tyrtaios ca. 525 B.C.By the way, Lena Headey, with fewer scenes and a smaller budget, outdoes Angelina Jolie in 'Alexander' for conveying a combination of feminine strength of character & sheer sensuality.

Equal parts bravado, guts and glory, ""300"" is simply the most exciting film to come out this year - or in several. Criticized for its violence and gore, fans of Miller's graphic novels will find that violence and gore to be as beautifully depicted on the screen as in the print version. A highly hyped CGI affair the cast could easily have been overcome by the sheer impressiveness of the physical production. To his credit director Zack Snyder is blessed with and uses a cast every bit equal to the challenge of competing with Miller's dark fantastic take of the Spartan's greatest story.Gerard Butler (Phantom of the Opera, Dear Frankie, etc.) adds yet another impressive and wildly different character to his arsenal of screen roles. As Leonidas, King of Sparta, Butler is, from his pigtail to his muscled, sandled feet, every inch a king; a true leader of men. His passion and intensity is matched by a splendid performance by Lena Headey as his wife, Queen Gorgo. Though a dutiful wife and a woman in an age when being such was near equal to slave status, she is, in her way, as bold and fearless as her husband/King. Dominic West is properly evil and oily as the traitor Theron and he's as nasty and duplicitous a villain as one can hope for. Rodrigo Santoro as a larger-than-life Xerxes is both comical and fearfully creepy equal parts drag queen and wanna be god. Behind all the glitzy piercings and bling, he is little more than self-inflated egotistical child.While there is blood and gore aplenty, the film also happens to be emotionally satisfying and I found myself with tears welling up in my eyes more than a few times, as well as wanting to raise my fist in the air along with the jacked-up Spartans!  While a macho stoicism pervades their attitudes, there are, to be sure, signs of a greater humanity beneath those ripped abs of Sparta's army - and plenty of heart.Parallels and allegories are already being drawn between today's warring world climate, super power dominations and the world of ancient Greece and the Middle East. While this provides an interesting commentary, I heartily recommend leaving that baggage at home and appreciating ""300"" on its own and embracing its escapism.Larry Fong's cinematography ensures that ""300"" is eye-poppingly glorious from start to finish - a magnificent feast for the eyes while Tyler Bates's score is guaranteed to keep your adrenaline pumping as it matches - frame-for-frame the visual intensity presented on the screen. While critics are divided on this one, audiences are flocking to it and cheering. For good reason, too: ""300"" is magnificent old-fashioned story telling wed to the very best 21st century filmmaking has to offer.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	Writing a review of a film such as '300' when not a fan of comic book style, superheroes, violent games carried on by children's hand held instruments, a film so overwhelmingly popular with the public that it promises to be the largest grossing film in history, and a film based on a 1999 'graphic novel' (read comic book) by the talented writer-artist Frank Miller and colorist Lynn Varley in an updated version of the famous battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC, places a viewer in a vulnerable position.  Yet every film made deserves the attention of a well-rounded examination and with that in mind this viewer offers the following thoughts.Zack Snyder directed this screenplay, sharing the writing credits with Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon about Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his group of 300 trained from birth soldiers to know no fear and to die as heroes who together fight the huge forces of King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) while leaving behind Queen Gorgo (Lena Headley) and the venomous Theron (Dominic West) to end to matters at hand in Sparta. A keen plan to meet the Persians (Persia of yore is now called Iran!) at a narrow gulch at Thermopylae supported the courage of the mighty buff Spartans to have a logistical advantage. But of course Xerxes' legions of rhinos, elephants and warriors ultimately kill all the Spartans: it is a story of heroism in the face of extraordinary odds.With the exception of a few moments at the beginning and a few well placed breathers through the long two-hour film the subject matter is fighting, blood, decapitation hither and yon, and piles of corpses used as barriers as the huge animals of Xerxes tumble off the cliffs.  Blood spatters the air and the actors and the story, giving credence to the illustration used to promote the film.  The problems, other than the 'overkill' of endless battle to the tune of soldiers shooting repeated 'HaRoos', for this viewer lie with the script which mixes contemporary slang with pompous Grecian proclamation - stretching the credibility of the story beyond the limit of tolerance; the excessive noise of battle in competition with a 'musical score' that keeps the volume to maximum level; the fact that the acting is minimal at best, though this may be part of the 'comic book' concept; and the apparent emphasis on having every Spartan look like the same beefcake mold form from an art department.There are a few moments of tenderness as when the Captain (Vincent Regan) watches his son's decapitated head float to the ground in slow motion and he for the first time offers human anguish. But for the most part this is a blood red movie that relies on audience appreciation for gore.  Yes, it is a successful cinematic transition of a comic book, but the real story of history being told is so much more moving. Yet the lines at the movie theaters remain long after 4 weeks of release... Grady Harp, March 07	3.0	HaRoo, HaRoo, HaRoo: Cinematic Overkill	2007-03-31	9	2	7

Sadly I feel that the DVD version would have been just as good as the BluRay. In the era where high definition is king, the 300 BluRay failed to capitalize on that angle by maintaining the films grainy appearance. And although the grain is meant to portray atmosphere, it does not do a HD setup justice. The features were sorely lacking and I fear that this title will suffer from ""DVDitis"" in that multiple releases of this product will feature the ""Unrated"" and ""Director's Cut"" moniker that almost all the current DVD's are subjected to. The special features were sorely lacking, although the ones on the BluRay were good, I feel that they could have done a better job at including more being that the BluRay format has more potential in terms of storage.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2P9795BHHW2OO	HAri	Nobody seems to care that the movie is highly racist and historically inappropriate. It seems to me that if you can make a visually stunning entertainer with great dialogues and muscular men you can sell any amount of racial prejudices, homophobia, historical revisionism and war propaganda. I would have liked the movie if the context was fictional and not based of a real historical battle. Movies like this can do great harm when viewed and cherished by the great multitudes of parochially educated, culturally and historically ignorant people that populate most of our world. This movie reminds me of Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom and its effect on the teeming ignoramuses of the world in forming opinions about Indians. Of course, everyone knows this is a fantasy movie. But how many people watching this movie are literate enough to have actually read anything about the glory of ancient Persian, Indian or Native American cultures to form a more informed opinion about these cultures? If all they are exposed to is Apocalypto, 300 and Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom which is usually the case then racial prejudices and unfounded notions of superiority over these civilizations are inevitable.	3.0	Apparently everyone loves a racist movie if it is entertaining!	2012-04-19	16	1	15
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A18MBO1U4DPY20	Harkanwar Anand	"...but that's about it.To my undaunted recollection, there were three scenes in this film that lived upto what the trailer promised. I'd give the trailer a genuine five stars, really. If I had not seen Sin City, I would have disliked this film. The acting in 300 was a mixed bag. King L's dialogue delivery, though intentional, looked and sounded stupid on more than two occasions. Of course,I understand that his character was of unparallel power and might BUT there was so much spit involved... In any case, 300 has a videogame demo like way of going about things. There is a lot of colour in this film which I like. It has the most interesting of starts and I liked it more when I went back home and spoke of it with people.One of the major reasons this film will never be recalled as a groundbreaker in terms of story and script would be because it lacked that substance. It lacked that ingenuity in character, it lacked a character that could be called a favourite, it was over-edited to please the audience I felt, it was a bit too fast yet a bit too slow, there was no intestinal grasping fortitude and the end was a bit wayward and shallow in how happy it seemed.The queen's character both saved and ruined this film. The gollum was left incomplete. I loved the sets. The background score was OK. Overall, fans of Sin City will like it 71% as much as they liked that. Sin City had the character of Roark and Elijah Wood that I just cannot forget about. If I was to speak with the Director and point out ONE FLAW in this film then it would have to be over animated intensity of every Spartan. I mean, I'm having my Popcorn in the audience and I'm wondering where is his real animosity coming from. There were not enough scenes to build up an anger. The film seems to launch the audience into an oblivious territory. We don't mind but we review, ok?Overall, 300 has a silly font in it's title and could have been so much better.  I loved the Rugby like battle formations. I still haven't figured out why so much of doozy attention was allotted to the children in the movie. (I mean, give me a break) ""Lord of the Ring"" fans will sit back and smile at each other after watching 300. However, I promised not to hate it because I loved some scenes. Is it a must watch?

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A276M3NSIY9B82	Harry Brewer	When I saw the trailers for this movie I knew there was going to be an immediate problem. After watching the movie my suspicions were confirmed. The battle of Thermopylae, as it's presented here, is mythologized. This battle was a real battle & unfortunately what's presented here isn't real. I get the impression that Zack Snyder, the director, had watched Lord of the Rings about 12 times too many. Lord of the Rings was fantasy, filming it as such was the right thing to do. The Battle of Thermopylae was a real event & deserves to be portrayed that way. The other big problem with the movie stems from too much computer graphics. All the brown & yellow colors kept me wanting to add more brightness on my tv.I know this is an action movie & that's what it focuses on but in no way did I feel that it was believable. The portrayal of Leonidas by Gerard Butler has to be one of the worst things ever done in a movie. But I'll give him some credit; he had very little to work with script-wise. In fact, there isn't any character development at all in this movie. Gerard seemed to base his character on Mel Gibson's Braveheart. There seemed to be a couple of times when he almost slipped into a Scottish brogue.There are some factual things in this movie but they are minimized except for, perhaps, the training of Leonidas as a youth. But almost everything I saw here reminded of a bad version of Lord of the Rings. The cast off Spartan hunchback was Gollum, The chained guy was a cave troll, the Immortals were orcs, the elephants, the rhinoceros (please!!!) was like the huge hyena creatures the orcs rode. And what's with the androgynous portrayal of Xerxes?I could go on & on about what's wrong with this movie. The other thing about a movie is its entertainment value. Well, I did find 300 somewhat entertaining but not in the way the director intended. This is some lame stuff. This battle was a real event & should've been portrayed as such. I'm just glad I borrowed this dvd, I wouldn't buy it or rent it.	1.0	300 (Widescreen Edition)	2008-04-21	19	8	11

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2HVL790PBWYTU	"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read"""	"As a guy, if this film doesn't get your blood churning and your testosterone pumped up to a deliriously critical level, well, you're either dead inside or you're a Tibetan monk with complete mastery over your cardiovascular and hormonal systems. 300 is a man's man's man's flick and is a muscular love poem which celebrates the ideals of honor, courage, sacrifice, and standing up for your beliefs. Righteous stuff.Not being much of a history buff, the only famous last stands I can instantly come up with are the Battles of the Alamo, of the Little Big Horn, and of Thermopylae (I guess I could also throw in Game 7 between the Lakers and the Blazers, 2000). Of these, the legendary Battle of Thermopylae is the most dramatic and is the mother of all last stands. I first heard about the Battle of Thermopylae (480BC) and the 300 Spartans way back when I was in high school, and I thought it a nifty story from the very first. A few years ago, I read Frank Miller's graphic novel 300 and enjoyed it tremendously, not caring at all that he altered things here and there as he opted instead to focus on the story's artistry, its sense of grandeur, and its mythological aspects. The filmmakers, make no mistake, take their cue from Mr. Miller. Remnants of historical facts are still somewhat represented under the film's glossy veneer but with some tweaking. You just have to see past the somewhat ridiculous parade of grotesque LORD OF THE RINGS-like creatures which Xerxes and director Zack Snyder send out.SPOILERS begin now:The film itself begins with the voiceover detailing the austere Spartan credo as we watch a baby boy quickly transition thru several phases of maturation as he grows into a young man, all the while being instructed and severely tested in the extremely brutal and uncompromising warrior ways of his people. We see him confronting his final test and craftily passing it, thus officially entering the ranks of Spartan soldierhood. This young man is Leonidas, who will become the king of the Greek city-state, Sparta.We pick up decades later as a Persian emissary pays a visit to King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his proud, beautiful wife and Queen, Gorgo (Lena Headey). The Persian calls for Sparta's submission to Xerxes, the God-King of Persia. After some deliberation, Leonidas's response isn't as much couched in diplomacy as it's couched in a sandal which propels the haughty emissary into a deep pit. Then, against the wishes of a lecherous, inbred group of mystics (who, nevertheless, control the Oracle) and the wishy-washy Spartan council, Leonidas gathers the 300 most capable soldiers in Sparta and, armed with a clever strategic plan, marches away to take on the vast hordes of the Persian invasion. If you've read your Greek history, you know what happens next...End SPOILERS.300 is bold in its scope and relentless in its take-no-prisoners attitude. It is a sweeping and sumptuously stark visual feast and would've made Frank Frazetta cream on his canvas. If 300 is based on Frank Miller's work (and it is), then Miller's art has to have been influenced in some ways by the great Frazetta. The film is saturated in mostly monochromatic hues which lend luster and even more drama to the bold crimsons of the Spartans' cloaks and the frequent spatters of blood and guts. I'm not normally a fan of slo-mo sequences, but I have to admit that, this time, the slo-mo-abruptly-segueing-into-fluid-motion (yeah, I think that's the technical term) bits are nicely executed and result in more thrilling battle scenes. The sword/spear fights are so stylized anyway that, after a while, they resemble a form of ballet. But a manly ballet, with hair on it. And, I don't often mention music in relation to films, but composer Tyler Bates truly adds an extra dimension of thrills with his thundering, pulse-pounding score. For sure, I'm gonna own this soundtrack.Gerard Butler comes into his own here. With his compelling and righteous performance, with towering machismo sweating out of his pores, he out-GLADIATORs Russell Crowe and, by comparison, reduces that silly ponce into a puddle of wussiness. No doubt, you and I'll be directly quoting from Leonidas in days to come: ""This...is...SPARTA!"" or ""Tonight, we dine in Hell!"" or (my favorite) ""Give them nothing but take from them...everything!"" As Leonidas, Butler displays all the innate qualities of leadership necessary to command an elite force like the Spartans, he's very convincing. Yet, his fierce and uncompromising temperament and his joy in battle are tempered by the obvious love and respect he holds for his wife. Whether knowingly or unknowingly, by his ideals and actions, he paved the way for the Greeks eventually routing the Persian masses.Lena Headey as the beleaguered Queen proves to be a match for Leonidas as she attempts to fight tooth and nail on the homefront to get the council off its collective arses and muster reinforcements for her husband. As Gorgo, Headey works hard to be fierce, dedicated, intelligent, and realistic. The actress is successful as I never doubted for a sec that this resolute woman is a Spartan to the very core. Her main adversary is the virulent Theron (Dominic West), a politician who reeks of underhandedness while holding a certain resemblance to Harry Hamlin. Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro has a showy but crucial part as the towering and deep-voiced King Xerxes.In the world of sword-and-sandal cinema, 300 quickly separates itself from the likes of TROY and ALEXANDER. I'd place it at the same excellent level as GLADIATOR. The story is unmatchable in its timelessness and resonance, the action is non-stop and visually compelling, the images are oh-so-memorable, and the lead characters are mezmerizing. And, from a mythological standpoint and in terms of cultural impact, the brave yet tragic 300 Spartans strike a chord as no other heroes do as they continue to be a testament to steadfast loyalty and courage in the face of overwhelming odds.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A8SS5YFQICR9W	Heather	"I originally had to view this movie for a history class on history on film. This movie blew me away. You have to keep in mind that it is based on a comic book so the coloring and graphics are going to look exactly like a graphic novel, which is actually one of the best parts because it is so unique. The movie is a little gory but that's because it is depicting one of the most famous battles of Ancient Greece. The acting is amazing. Also, while you are watching it, you can see a lot of intentional parallels with America and its involvement in the war in Iraq. When the Spartan Queen goes before her ""congress"" she speaks about how the war is being fought for all the reasons America goes to war. So this movie is actually oddly relevant.This movie will have you rooting for the 300 spartans and will have you on the edge of your seat. It is non-stop action and fairly historically accurate. It also follows the graphic novel to a ""T"". I highly recommend this for any history fans, graphic novel fans, and fans of war & actions movies.

A fantastic feast for the eyes - it was filmed entirely against blue and green screens at high speed.  The movie has a grimy, greasy, ""sweaty"" quality - it even looks like a vintage, tinted film at times.  The effect is jaw-dropping and creates magnificent, surreal battles, humans, and ""creatures"".  Spartan warriors appear as 8-foot tall mythical men (Apparently due to a six-week intense training period before filming) ...not even Sin City comes close to this kind of original depth in film.  Every minute is filled with tension and excitement and most should be credited to Gerard Butler whose appearance and ferociousness as Leonidas, the Spartan king actually make us believe the few 300 Spartan soldiers may have stood some chance at glory - he is indeed mammoth and engaging- his voice alone is carries the weight of a charging army and he has the charisma of a rock star on screen (as he has been in life).In my opinion, 300 is more engaging than Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, or Alexander the Great.  While there is no surprise story to most who have any knowledge of Greek history, its visual treatment of the Battle of Thermopylae will surely become legendary.  Graphically, 300 is sure to set the bar unbearably high for future action films to follow.On a side note, it should be interesting to see how the American public reacts to a film heralding ""retreat"" as a fate worse than death-as we are a sensitive audience in the middle of a war.My vote-see it in the theater and own it on DVD for a lifetime-its the best action film I have seen in years."	5.0	Fear the Spear	2007-03-12	15	9	6

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A39QEKNEFSJ34Q	hrladyship	The advertisements for this film did not entice me to see it.  It was word of mouth that brought me to the theater to see it on the big screen.  And I wasn't disappointed.  It was probably just as well that I didn't know going in that it was from a graphic novel.  That might have quelled my interest.  Especially upon seeing the special effects in those ads.Although the filmmakers -- and the writers of the novel -- took liberties with the story, there was enough of the original history of Thermopylae to maintain interest.  The actors were well chosen.  The artwork and special effects were unique and worked as part of the story rather than as just stuck in there because it could be done.The biggest disappointment would have been predictable had I known of the origins of the story.  Xerxes, the Persian ruler, was so monstrous that when he first appeared on screen, he drew the viewer out of the story.  Unfortunately, he was laughable, and the story became too cartoonish.  I was glad I went to see it.  I just wish the quality of story and characterization had been maintained throughout.	4.0	Surprisingly good	2007-07-06	6	5	1
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A11D5TH3NT4CWG	"H. Sansom ""huw_the_book"""	"This film is interesting for one reason only -- it's reproduction of the visual quality of the graphic novel on which it is based. Otherwise the film has no merits at all -- no acting, just endless angry rants from brutish automatons. Gross over-simplification of history in a pathetic attempt to draw a parallel with current events -- a pro-Bush, pro-war, pro-racism parallel.I enjoy a nice violent action flic as much as the next fellow, but this has none of the variation or, dare I say, subtlety that makes such films work. It is just one unending slashfest.I thought the graphic novel was racist anti-historical garbage when I read it, and the film is worse -- a classic example of the Hollywood line in which ""bad guys"" are dark skinned and/or ugly, good guys are white. In 300, a surprisingly large number of the Persians are black. Now Persia was what is now Iran -- how close to Africa is that? And if that's not enough to trigger the bigotries of American audiences, Persian emperor Xerxes is, by, not-very-subtle implication, gay.The response of the film's advocates is, predictably, that this is just entertainment. But, equally predictably, if a film were to portray the proxy-Americans as thick-headed barbarians bent only on murder (a portrayal which could indeed be said to accord with the facts of recent years), the film would be condemned.A historical note. The principle historical source for what happened at the battle of Thermopylae is Herodotus. Even in his own time, he was not considered much of a historian. Aristotle reviled him. If you find this unconvincing, how likely do you think it is that Xerxes fielded a force of 1 million or more 2500 years ago?"	1.0	300 racist brutes bellowing	2007-11-22	23	10	13

Now, I had heard that this movie was simple minded, and well,it's not, it's actually a really compelling and inspirational story.I need to take a moment to comment on the special effects in this movie. They are superb; The green screen was beautifully rendered, slow motion was used PERFECTLY (On a similar level with The Matrix and what i've seen of Dredd), and the bloodlooked all comic-bookey (almost like in The Spirit or Sin City).This movie surprised me, on SO many levels.The acting was great, the story was epic to a fault, the effects where captivating,and as a whole,the movie has rightfully earned it's 80%- Visually stunning, masterfully directed, and bringing a graphic novel to life,300 manages to tell a fairly simple story, but it's delivery redefines the historic action genre and comic book movies alike.	5.0	Attention Movie Lovers: Zack Snyder is one Bad-Ass Movie Director	2014-02-28	0	0	0

To give you an idea of a movie with that problem, think of ""Hulk"".#2: The CGI--The effects in this movie are amazing with VISUALS I have NEVER seen in other movies. Simple as that!!!#3: The movie is basically REAL ancient history with a fictional twist--After watching this movie, I watched the special features and googled information about the Spartans and was amazed to see not everything in 300 was FICTIONAL and the some of the events in the movie REALLY did happen (No, I'm not talking about the giants elephant-looking creatures...you ACTUALLY thought they were REAL???)Easily a 5-Star Movie"	5.0	300 reasons to watch 300	2007-08-02	6	6	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A192KEPM0HW6AC	"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e..."	"300--director Zack Snyder's faithful, if controversial, adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel--is a visually striking, though loosely interpreted, telling of the now-immortal Battle of Thermopylae.Over a three-day period in 480 BC, King Leonidas and his three hundred Spartan bodyguards--with the assistance of about seven hundred Thespians and few thousand volunteers from other Greek city-states--fought the massive armies (estimated in most ancient accounts to have exceeded one million) of Persian Emperor Xerxes I at the Pass of Thermopylae on the Gulf of Malis. Through martial skill, fearlessness, and sheer audacity, Leonidas and his warriors held off the Persians long enough for the Athenians to prepare their navy to defeat the Persians at the Battle of Salamis, and thus save Greece.The Battle of Thermopylae is a timeless tale of valor and honor. It takes its place in history with other legendary military standoffs--such as the Battle of the Alamo in 1836, where a few hundred Texans held off the Mexican army for thirteen days, and the 1939 ""Winter War,"" the World War II battle in which Finnish forces repelled over one million Russian invaders. Why, then, would a cinematic retelling of this remarkable event of so long ago prompt argument and debate today?Historical film epics are rarely contentious enterprises nowadays, precisely because they portray events long since past. The ones that do spark heated debate tend to have religious themes, such as The Passion of the Christ and The DaVinci Code. If there's any blasphemy to be found in 300, it's against oracles and deities long since relegated to the dustbin of piety. Certainly there was little controversy in 1962 when Miller's original inspiration, director Rudolph Mat&eacute;'s The 300 Spartans, was released. So what's happened in the forty-five intervening years to make Snyder's remake-of-sorts so controversial?In a word: multiculturalism.Just as in the days of the ancient Greeks, the theme of saving the civilized West from barbaric Asiatic hordes is made quite explicit in 300, and given voice by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler): ""A new age has begun, an age of freedom. And all will know that three hundred Spartans gave their last breath to defend it . . .The world will know that free men stood against a tyrant, that few stood against many.""But unlike the days of the ancient Greeks, it's now verboten to suggest the superiority, let alone the preferability, of Western culture to any other--including, presumably, Persian culture. And therein lies the controversy over this film. As ""civilized people,"" we're not supposed to like war, much less relish military victory or the enemy's demise. Hell, we can't even use the word ""enemy"" anymore to describe the enemy. These days, when Hollywood goes to war, our fighting men are represented--at best--by that ubiquitous fixture of modern cinema, the ""reluctant warrior.""In contrast, Leonidas's Spartans are hardly reluctant: Born and bred since childhood to fight for their military city-state, they're professional soldiers who revel in the sting of battle. Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) sends an officer to present an ultimatum to his vastly outnumbered foe: ""Spartans, lay down your weapons!"" Rather than accommodating the Persians (as, say, the British Navy did circa 2007 AD), Leonidas roars back: ""Persians, come and get them!""In all of battle lore, Thermopylae stands as the ultimate ""David versus Goliath"" confrontation of civilizations. To most people familiar with Italian Renaissance art, this legend conjures in their minds the great statues by Donatello and Michelangelo. Both are nude figures of the young Hebrew warrior. Donatello's David is but a boy. Without a care in the world, he leans on his sword with one hand, his other hand resting effeminately against his hip. Think of the eternally boyish Leonardo DiCaprio or Elijah Wood. More famous is Michelangelo's manlier David. He's muscular and stands erect, gazing off in serene contemplation. But, while Michelangelo captures David's physical beauty and agility, his is a static, motionless fighter; the sculpture merely hints at the decisive moment ahead. Think Brad Pitt in Troy.Any David who would have a chance of felling the monstrous Philistine had better be credible--one tough s.o.b. Baroque-era sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini depicts just that kind of David--not naked, but clothed in soldier's tunic, coiled back to fling the rock at Goliath. Bernini freezes his hero in motion: Taut, fierce, and grimacing, Bernini's magnificent figure conveys both the intent and the execution of his bold, violent act.The genius of 300 lies in Snyder's and cinematographer Larry Fong's ability to dramatize that same highly stylized sense of kinetic energy and unfreeze it. In particular, as Leonidas, the burly, bearded Scottish actor Gerard Butler is Bernini's David brought to life.Many reviewers have touted 300's ""comic book"" visual sensibility. To me, it doesn't look like a comic book at all, but rather like an oil painting set in motion. In fact, anyone familiar with Frank Miller's striking illustrations will note the same qualities in those works. Using a color scheme of burnished tones, 300 manifests a sophisticated visual unity that owes much more to Jacques-Louis David's painting The Oath of the Horatii (1785) and Akira Kurosawa's film Ran (1985) than it does to Spider-Man or The Fantastic Four. The rich, gorgeous Technicolor prints further intensify the viewing experience.This visual stylization is one reason why 300 seems more real than the more historically accurate The 300 Spartans--even though the original was shot on location in Greece, while Snyder filmed his entirely on soundstages in Quebec. For example, the new, stylized Spartan is divested of his breastplate in favor of a uniform that makes him look like a cross between Kirk Douglas in his Spartacus get-up and wrestler Hulk Hogan in leather briefs. But the 1962 movie was filmed mostly from a distance, and the actors' stiff performances were even more distant. The battle scenes looked like re-enactments; you could tell those Spartans were just a bunch of extras holding spears and shields.Not so with this crew: While the scenery in 300 may have been rendered by CGI artists, the six-pack abs and bulging biceps on these Spartans are real, the product of a grueling five-month-long exercise regimen in which the actors also got Marine Corps ""Oorah!"" attitude training. And instead of remote, set-piece battle scenes, Snyder gives us relentless, in-your-face combat--beautifully choreographed bloodletting. He conveys with blinding clarity how the Spartans could pull off such a sustained, concerted defense against a numerically superior force. When they go into their phalanx battle formation, you immediately realize why individual soldiers became such a deadly weapon when they fought in unison, something the 1962 film barely depicted.I could tell 300 was going to be a smash hit when the intelligentsia descended upon this movie, unleashing all the sneering invective their vocabularies could muster--from ""militaristic"" and ""fascistic"" to ""testosterone-laden"" and ""jingoistic."" Typical was Andrew Sarris, reigning ""dean"" of American film critics, writing in the New York Observer:""300 was as pathetically puerile as I had expected. Yet I can't say that it wasn't at least minimally entertaining. Indeed, there was a subtextual strangeness about the spectacle that would have made the ghost of Leni Riefenstahl nod in recognition.""Fortunately, the attempt to cut this superb picture down to size is more of an uphill battle than the one that Leonidas and his men fought. What repelled so many of our literati is also the source of its unexpected devotion among mainstream movie fans, (to the tune of $421 million in gross receipts, as of this writing): Miller and Snyder invest 300 with the stuff of mythical legend.Butler's Leonidas is a defiant figure with a bit of Phaeton and Sisyphus in him. He ignores the counsel of the Oracle (Kelly Craig), who orders him not to confront the Persians. ""Trust the gods, Leonidas,"" the governing council cautions him. Leonidas counters, ""I would prefer you trust your reason."" Well aware that the very future of reason and democracy lies with his Spartans, the ascetic Leonidas faces down the decadent god-king Xerxes, proclaiming, ""We wrest the world from your mysticism and tyranny!""The epic tone of the story is further realized through the narration of Dilios (David Wenham), the one-eyed warrior who returns to Sparta to relate Leonidas's story of courage and bravado to his own soldiers, firing them up to do battle again with the invading Persians. Mere days after his death, Leonidas is already elevated to the status of Epic Hero.As Leonidas's wife, Queen Gorgo, Lena Headey gives a stirring performance. When the movie opens, a Persian messenger (Peter Mensah) rebukes Leonidas: ""Why does this woman think she can speak amongst men?"" The queen fires back, ""Because only Spartan women give birth to real men!"" In a quiet scene before Leonidas heads off to war, she bolsters her king's confidence: ""Spartan: Come back with your shield--or on it."" It's a lesson in honoring the spirit of a fallen loved one that's completely lost on the Cindy Sheehans of our age.History buffs and armchair philosophers have come out of the woodwork to chide viewers for buying into the movie's inaccuracies. Just as common are complaints that the Greeks had slavery, that Sparta practiced infanticide, that the Spartan army was filled with conscripts, and that they--by gladly laying down their lives in a suicide mission--were hardly rational exemplars of  individualism.With all due respect to the Borg, however, resistance to 300 is futile. Its grand sweep and awesome storytelling had me cheering Leonidas's fearless warriors. What can't be denied is the movie's premise that the seeds of individualism (which is a later, Enlightenment notion, anyhow) were planted in the Greek soil they so gallantly defended.And, to anyone laboring under the misconception that soldiers are the opposite of individualists, I beg to differ. Over my years of military service, I've come to know many Airborne Rangers, Special Forces Green Berets, infantry grunts, Marines, and psychological operations specialists. To a man, these hardcore warriors personify the qualities of character exemplified by Leonidas and his hoplites: heads held high, rigorous discipline, physical prowess, intransigent certainty, moral courage, the ability to face reality at its most grim--and the willingness to think. When it comes to individualism, these guys walk the walk; everything else is just talk.Through its images of crushing brutality, 300 reminds us that the bounties of civilization that we take for granted are a gift passed down through time from men like Leonidas. Or, in words famously (though perhaps mistakenly) attributed to George Orwell: ""We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.""With 300, Frank Miller and Zack Snyder have concocted an antidote to the steady diet of cynicism and derisive irony that Hollywood has been feeding our youth for decades. If you thirst for a tale that extols honor and reveres gallantry, in which the good guys are great and the bad guys are evil, then look no further than this stupendous cinematic achievement."	5.0	Real Spartans Don't Eat Quiche - THEY DINE IN HELL!!!!	2007-09-07	4	3	1

Oh wait, it derived from a comic book written for a 12 yr old!The acting and action remind me of WWF wrestling. It is not only fake, but it is also macho fake. They must also have used cheap 1980's kung-fu films for inspiration of their fighting sequences. Characters carry a dialogue while almost playfully slashing their foes.All this is too bad since the real story of the 300 Spartans hardly had to be sensationalized. The heroics of the 300 Spartans is one of the truly memorable ""last stand"" in military history. Most, if not all, military academies teach the valor of the 300 Spartans who gave up their lives NOT for their ego but to protect the flanks of other retrieving Spartans (yes Spartans DID retreat when it made sense).If anything, this movie downplays the heroism of the 300 Spartans. Why did the story ignore the fact the 300 Spartans knowingly sacrificed themselves to protect the flanks of the entire Spartan army?Lastly, the movie had some sinister themes. For example, politicians who oppose war are the sinister antagonists. The hero Leonidis, the protagonist, recklessly engages in a battle against Persians even though it is ""illegal"" and not sanctioned by rest of the Sparta.Who are the Persians? (present day Iran and parts of Iraq). They are portrayed as inhuman warmongers who happens to have a 7-9 foot tall  androgenous dude as their leader.Were the creators trying to draw analogy to George W Bush's invasion of Iraq?Who knows.

This is one of those times. From beginning to end, I was riveted to my seat. I predict that a few years from now, when some people say, ""They don't make 'em like that anymore,"" they'll be referring to ""300"" and movies like it.Now, a ""critical"" comment on certain ""critics."" There are a lot of naysayers who complain about historical inaccuracies in the film. My question to them is ""Why?"" This movie is about a real historical event and many of the roles were of real people who participated. But everyone going into this movie KNEW (or should have known) that it was based on a ""graphic novel."" Some such novels are referred to as ""faction"" - a mixture of fact and fiction. So I went into the theater expecting nothing more than a good tale of action and adventure. And, I got what I was looking for. Critics looking for a factual retelling of events should rent or buy the History Channel special, ""Last Stand of the 300."" But if you do, buy some ""No-Doz"" tablets to stay awake ... something no one needed to take for this film.Final note. If you're wondering why I only rated it 4 out of 5, here's why. I was totally immersed in the action when a film-goer 2 seats behind me started laughing and said, ""Oh, God - a smallpox vaccination."" My eyes were immediately drawn to the bare upper left arm of a Spartan soldier who was talking to Leonidas and, sure enough, there was a big-as-life circular smallpox vaccination scar on his arm. It did take some enjoyment away from the film as I confess to spending some of my time looking for other flubs (Rolex watches, etc.). Didn't see any. And, if it hadn't been for a sharp-eyed film-goer, I'd have rated this film a solid 5.It is already on my ""to buy"" list when the DVD is made available."	4.0	Perfect for what it was.	2007-03-18	11	6	5

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1OYW08VVPMP3Q	"James D. Crabtree ""Doc Crabtree"""	This film takes quite a bit of dramatic license in presenting the story of 300 Spartans, led by one of their kings, who stood against the armies of Xerxes as the Persian Empire attempted to annex the Greek states. The Persian Empire, composed of many conquered peoples, represented the autocratic despotism of the slave state while the Greeks, for all their faults, represented the future of western civilization. Having invented democracy, a usable phonetic alphabet, rhetoric and philosophy the Greeks and their culture would have a long-lasting impact that would last right up to modern times. Had Xerxes managed to defeat the Spartans under Leonidas quickly and destroy the various Greek states before they could fully mobilize then the spark which lit our civilization would have been snuffed out.It is interesting that Sparta, which represented all that was bad in Greek civilization, was the city-state which saved civilization. Centered around war, harshly administered and with a slave caste which provided targets for training their soldiers Sparta was NOT a democracy.All that aside, the story as told in the film is a moving one and it meets all the marks. The nudity seems a bit unnecessary but the violence depicted, if anything, was probably not as graphic as what it actually looked like.	5.0	Saving Western Civilization	2007-12-09	2	1	1

Death before Dishonor.Everyone has a part to play, which part is up to you, how you influence others around you can make the difference between a traitor or a supporter.Free men make a difference.  Sparta had 10-15 slaves per citizen. But all the kids from a slave or citizen were put to the test and had the choice to be a citizen . A slave was the result of poverty or loss of a battle.  No one got a free ride.  Women held same status, but had different duties.  And not all men were warriors but all were expected to defend the home state as well as the women.  Said to be the first true Communistic society by some historians.  Yes if you mean that everyone worked for the better of the City State.  But that's a far cry from what's considered communist today.  Think more toward a very close nit combat unit.  Everyone ether was a warrior or supported the warrior.

Leaving me bored and waiting for the epic battle in the end, which turns out to be just another cop out.Visually this moves stunning, truly capturing the comic book, the only problem is that it captures it so much that it forgets that it's a film as well and films are time based, that the audience has to watch and wait for every shot not like in a comic book where you can move thought images giving the comic your passing.  Also because the film using only slow-motion for the fight scene it start to be overly apparent that non of the actors can actually fight because the chorography is simply for that one ever so slow swing of the sword leaving digital blood spraying out.The battles though there pretty, are in most situations different from shot to shot, the amount of people change as the director tries to match the comic forgetting again that it's a movie and the people in the back ground need to stay in their places from shot to shot or the characters will be lost in a void.Then that brings me to the character development, I'm not even going to say it's lacking, is just not there.  The characters have nothing to them besides a few ""witty line"" that are mostly man lines, and when a character that I'm showed that I should care about dies in slow motion I'm usually waiting for him to hit the ground so I can get on to the next slow shot.  But I do have to give credit to the female character in the film.  She's actually interesting and well worked, why there no slow shots to give her emotion they actually wrote her lines and situation that have emotional backing behind them.  But I do know that these were added in as well and not in the comic again showing that the comic is pretty but isn't a movie.And the true kicker for me was that this film wasn't just boring, it also had a very underlying racist feeling behind it.  Here are the Spartans, our heroes fighting for freedom from the eastern invaders. Spartans are Caucasians and the eastern enemy is everything dark.  Hollywood must have put out a casting call and made two lines, darks and lights.  But if you look at people from those areas the Spartans come from on earth you'll notice that they are actually of darker skin and not Caucasian as a Norwegian. So here I am watch this film getting borage with images of dark people are evil and light skins are heroes and manly men.  But I'm also left thinking but these manly men are no better then their attackers they throw their defective babies away, and are known to be in the slave trade.  But the film say, not do not think of this, remember it is fine to do these horrible things as long as you have something to fight for.  So they fight the dark skins.All this made a film that is racist and boring.  Giving support to a nation of savages simply because they are of light skin and hating the ones that come of darker skin.  Yes the darker ones are attacking but they do give the option of surrender and besides a large tax they would live under the regime quite free.  The only reason I give this film 2 stars is because how pretty it is."	2.0	its pretty, and racist	2007-08-24	7	1	6

Although, Hollywood already had one version in 1962, it's but a shadow of, "" 300 "". Seeing the original and then watching this update, viewers will immediately see the difference. The first is candy coated and offered to entertain audiences holding a box of popcorn. This movie with it's spectacular visual panorama, violent action scenes and overall dramatic effects, will cause you to hold your breath. Gerard Butler, is impressive as King Leonidas. Dominic West as Theron and Vincent Regan as the Captain. Rodrigo Santoro is Xerxes, in modern gang attire and jewelry. This film may have originated in comic pages, but it explodes on the silver screen as iconic art. This version is sure to inspire some to visit the site of the heroic last stand, but may also inspire others to delve into the history books. On that note, there are minor historical mistakes, such as the Spartan king demeaning the Atheans as boy-lovers (which law allowed) but in fact, it was Spartan culture which habitually practice pederasty. Another literary goof, was the use of War-rhinos, elephants and mutants. One in particular which bothered me was the Greek traitor 'Ephialtes' as having been deformed. No historical reference to that. The idea of single Spartan fathers training their sons individually goes against traditional schooling in military academies. One last criticism. The Spartans claimed they fought for freedom and stated the Persian king was a tyrant. Any history book on Sparta, will illuminate the fact, Sparta used Helots as Slaves. Nevertheless, if you don't mind, these and a few other inaccuracies, the film will astonish you with its movie magic and I predict, will imprint itself as a Classic. *****"	5.0	""" The Irresistable force versus the Immoveable object """	2009-04-11	1	1	0

I didn't care about any grainy scenes on this blu-ray disc since I didn't like the movie anyway. Save your money. Rent or borrow it.	2.0	One star for decaps; one star for spearings.	2009-04-21	1	0	1

If you're familiar with the comic book adaptation movie genre, ala Sin City, you'll recognize the same approach in 300. As a historical drama the movie is flawed, but as a doomed buddy film its entertaining.  The parallels to the current day political scene are obvious.  The racial overtones of the movie were unnecessary.  It's a good movie to watch once or twice, but its not one that I'll go back to time and time again.	3.0	Impressive Graphics	2007-08-28	4	2	2

The movie is way too grainy in my opinion. I understand that is how the movie was made to look, but I do not recall it lookin that bad in the previews. It is a great movie, but instead of the usual 'looking for the non-HD-like shots in the movie', I found myself instead looking for every shot that did NOT have such a grainy effect. Those parts were impressive, I must say.Buying it on Blue-Ray OR HD-DVD will make no difference. Quality is NOT better on one over the other. And I for one am not into all the extras anyway except for deleted scenes and bloopers. LOTR is my only exception to this. :) The reason I bought it on HD is because I bought the two-hundred dollar 360 HD-DVD player add-on, not because one is so much better than the other.	3.0	An actual review	2007-08-16	0	0	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	APZC5PRJVM0PY	JD	"300 is perhaps one of the most enjoyable movies that I've seen.  300 is a screen adaptation of a graphic comic and, in that context, it delivers exactly what you would expect.  I came out of the theater thinking how refreshing it was to see a movie that was everything it set out to be and nothing more.  If you are expecting something deep then this is NOT the movie for you.  300 is based on a historical event but only loosely so.  The plot and the charachters are shallow but excellent in their simplicity, as is the everything else about 300.  Everything is invested in telling one story and leaving it at that.There is a small taste of accuracey to be had in 300 but primarily it is more of a visceral ride than a historical account.  It tells of the Spartan King (Leonidas) who is faced with a tough decision:  bow to the Persian God/King Xerxes and give up everything that Spartan life is composed of or face the Persian army and die in Spartan's defense.  Already knowing what the Persians have in mind for him and his people Leonidas is motivated to march 300 of his best to certain death rather than face slavery at the hands of the Persians.I've read in countless reviews that people have a hard time grasping Leonidas decisions and attitudes but if anyone has studied warrior societies then the decision of Leonidas is to be expected.  They don't relish the thought of death but knowing that death is inevitable they choose to make their deaths mean something.  Leonidas sums it up later when he says that history will remember that 300 Spartans gave their lives in defense of their world.So, with his decision made Leonidas takes 300 of his best men and meets the Persian army at the ""Hot Gates"".  A narrow passageway from the coast that allows the Spartans to use the terrain to funnel the Persians until only a portion of their army can engage them at a given time.  Here the Spartans put up a valient (but ultimately doomed) defense, holding the Persian army on the coast while giving the rest of the Greeks time to come to terms with how they intend to deal with the Persians that will soon be spilling into their country.  300 doesn't waste any steam ellaborating what the rest of the Greeks or up to, although it does go into a little political intrigue concerning the fight Leonidas queen must face to try and commit the rest of the Spartan Army.  In the end, this hardly matters and is not fully developed but it does setup the ending of the movie where the full might of the two armies (that of all the Greeks and the Persians) meet on battlefield of Platea (spelling?).  But ultimately 300 keeps the focus on Leonidas's force of 300 and thier role.Visually, 300 is a beautiful peice of work.  Much like the comic the visuals are simplistic and muted with occasional vibrance for effect (primarily this is in the form of the Spartan's crimson uniform and the blood they are spilling).  A mixture of film is employed throughout the fight sequences including a fair amount of slow motion and camera closeups.  After watching action movies where the action scene assails the viewer with chaos I enjoyed again the simplistic nature of 300's fight scenes.  You are up close with the combatant immersed in the smooth choreography and pristine CGI.The sounds and musical score are also appropriate for the theme of the movie (no, I didn't find anything wrong with the guitar riff at the climax of action, it felt appropriate for the movie I was watching).  The sounds of blows, screams and other such effects are concentrated while the rest of the combat noise is pushed into the background.  Not realistic, but very appropriate for the film.The acting, as said above, is nothing if not simplistic.  The script is basic, to the point, and consists primarily of stirring statements that are used to up the pulse of the movie.  The actors are in no way pushed to bring anything across as the movie, as a whole, builds everything and as much as the audience is the actors appear to be swept up in it.In the end I can that 300 is a movie that I will certainly add to my collection and one that I will find myself watching a lot in the future when I want some simple entertainment and an action movie that focuses on one thing:  ACTION.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"This adaptation of Frank Miller's ultra-macho graphic novel of the same name, is a huge success. At least insofar as it brings the blood-soaked Battle of Thermopylae to the attention of the viewing public. And, not incidentally, by bringing Miller's already-lively art to cinematic life.Everything about the movie is larger than life. The muscled and hardened Spartans, with their dewy pecs and scarlet battle cloaks. The effete, face-pierced Persian king Xerxes, the god-man who  would conqueror Greece. The grossly-deformed, Gollum-like, Ephialtes who will betray the Spartans. The Spartans themselves, who laugh madly at danger and welcome glorious death. The film's strangeness is also outsized. Noble King Leonidas is the wise Spartan strongman. But his rule seems tempered by a typically sniveling and timid city council. In battle, Leonidas's men waste time and energy building enormous barricades from the corpses of their foes. The battles themselves are drawn out affairs that feature if-looks-could-kill snarling, martial-arts slashing and spinning, many severed heads and gallons of splashing blood. In an objective case of the aphorism ""less is more,"" the film oversaturates us with fighting, noble manliness, dehumanized enemies and treacherous friends. It often comes ""this close"" to becoming a self-parody. Indeed, there were more than a few times when the portrayal of ""nobility"" spilled over into mawkishness. Leonid's goodbye scene with his wife, in which she tells him to ""Come back with your shield or on it,"" being one of the most blatant.That said, many of the film's artistic touches were wonderful. Several scenes of Spartans in battle were deliberately reminiscent of familiar images of lance-hurling warriors on Greek pottery. The weird brownish lighting gave the film an ancient, other-worldly glow.As a parallel to current events, ""300"" is curious. Do we in the US see ourselves as a few noble fighters, enfeebled by legislation, prone to betrayal by our own, and faced with hordes of demonic foes? Perhaps we do, and perhaps that's why US soldiers watch this film to pump themselves up for battle in Afghanistan and Iraq. If so, then ""300"" is a cultural marker that says more about our internal sense of vulnerability and isolation than it does about any objective assessment of our strength. It's from these ironies that many an academic thesis is built!"	3.0	300 eye-rolls	2012-08-28	0	0	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AQ38OU6SRFGU5	"Jeffery E. Blascyk ""the Shamrock kid"""	"300 is a movie based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller published by Dark Horse comics in 1998.  The movie details the battle of Thermopile, 300 Spartan solders vs the million plus of the Persian army.  Some of you might be aware of the actual story of this battle that the facts of has been disputed for countless years.  Many of the facts, namely the number of Persian solders and the number of Greek solders from other cities, are widely disputed by history scholars.  The one fact that cannot be disputed is that there were only 300 Spartan warriors and they were heavily out number, conservatively 100 to 1, and that they absolutely punished the Persians and brutally slain so many that all would know, till the end of time, that the 300 Spartans were some of the fierce, highly skilled and battle savvy warriors ever to walk this earth.Put your history book down because this movie is not trying to be historic fact.  This a historic battle depicted as a comic book with Hollywood moxy and juiced with testosterone and a shot of pure adrenaline. This version of the story is balls out, unapologetically graphic, gratuitous, and brutal.  This CG stylized action flick is full of with quick witted dialog and epic battle scenes that will please the carnal beast hidden in every man, (and some women.)One of the things that was surprising to me was the acting in it is quite good.  It has it's heart felt moments that added depth and emotion to the story without being sappy or heavy handed.  The dialog was very true to the original graphic novel as well as many shots in the movie were pulled right from Frank Miller's comic page.  This movie honors the spirit of Miller's book much like Sin City did, and is a true testament to the respect that Frank Miller is given to his master works from Hollywood Producers and Directors.This Movie was directed by Zach Snyder, director of the Dawn of the Dead remake a few years back. Zach showed great skill and pulled out all the stops and new tricks in digital film making.  The look of the movie was vivacious, visceral and visually appetizing, much like the graphic novel.  The battle scenes were heavy in the CG and noticeably so, but not to the detriment of the movie because it fit with the heightened sense and surreal feeling this movie is shooting for.  This movie has heart,a pumping blood soaked heart that makes one long for the days that you could swing an axe into someone's face.This movie could have been a disaster and very well could have turned into a sappy male bonding, homo erotic ""I love you man"" type movie but no!  It's tough, gritty and raw till the bitter, blood soaked end.  Never to shed a pussiefied tear or besmirch the legacy of great warriors with unwarrentedsentimental drivel.  This film is more like Lord of the Rings than Braveheart, so make sure you know what your about to watch.  A couple of the dudes setting next to me commented on some of the exaggerated characters that look more like creatures than people, not realizing it was done for dramatic effect and cinematic splendor.I only recognized one person in this entire movie and that was David Wenham, who played Faramir in Lord of the Rings.  King Leonidas is played by Gerard Butler (who played opposite Christian Bale and Mathew McConaughey in 2002's Reign of Fire) now proved that not only can he hold the screen in a leading role but he can do it with intensity and charisma.  He transformed himself into this character for this role and knows when to play it soft or blow your pansy little socks off by roaring ""This... is... Sparta!"".  I can't say enough about his performance and look forward to seeing more of him in the future.  The other notable performances were by the Queen of Sparta played by the ravishing Lena Headey.  Her performance really gave the movie some true thespian legitimacy.The other members of the supporting cast holds up and add many dynamic characters and personalities to the movie. This movie hold up as one of the best of the early films of 2007. It's one of those movies that is just a blast to see on the big screen and just escape into.  It's not the best movie of this type of genre but it's close. All in all it's a very strong film that I must go see a second time."	4.0	Frank Miller should be proud	2007-03-10	6	4	2

The gore is plentiful. The action is fast and furious. Every young man has six-pack abs and all the women were sexy and beautiful. The Spartan ideal of the best way to die is in battle so your name will live on in glory. Freedom is worth any sacrifice. Great movies like ""Henry V"", ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" and ""Braveheart"" use the same themes. The movie places the famous Spartan quotes in context like ""Either return with your shield or on it"" and Leonides's quote about ""We will fight in the shade."" This was pretty cool.The ""BraveHeart"" ending that the death of Leonides and the 300 at Thermopylae inspired the Greek city states to join together to fight the Persians was touching. In many ways 300 is like Braveheart on steroids.The movie delivers just what you expect from the previews.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	Frank Miller's stylish piece of a graphic novel gets an equally stylish treatment on screen.  Zach Snyder transfers the book almost panel for panel to the digital media and makes it a sight to behold.There are visual aspects of 300 that deserve a lot of praise.  Lets start with the photography; although nearly all CGI, the landscapes and panorama's are stunning and vibrantly shot.  The slightly washed out color gives it that look of an ancient time and place.  With so much emphasis placed on the beauty of the scenery as well as the tactical nature of the battles, you loose yourself in the movie.  The actors have pumped themselves up to Greek warrior stature and studied at the Roman Warrior Military academy in order to take on the skills of spear and shield combat.  It's impressive stuff, especially when you see the tactics actually being used so effectively during long camera shots of these Spartans trouncing their enemies even though they are outnumbered.The plot is based...and pay close attention to that word `based', on the Battle of Thermopylae (The-mop-pole-ee).  This battle was where 300 Spartan Warriors held off the massive Army of the Persian empire from getting through a mountain pass, buying time for the other unconquered nations to form an army.  In order to make it more dramatic in the comic medium, the opposing forces were composed of various types of warriors from different cultures that had been absorbed into the Persian Army.  This makes the battles more interesting as the Persian Leader, King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) sends wave after wave of increasingly difficult and skilled fighters against the live-to-die Spartans.  The Kings attempt at Diplomacy with King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) fails as well so there is no choice but to wipe them out, no matter how many men he looses.As I said, the plot may be based in history, but the dramatic license takes it way out of the factual environment and puts it in the realm of fantasy.  But not before you understand the reason these men fought; for glory and honor and to protect their people.  All good causes.  No matter how fantastic the movie gets, the basic premise is firmly grounded in the first fifteen minutes of the film.  The relationship between King and Queen, the proud nature of the Spartans and their resistance to being conquered...all made very clear.  Butler gives a powerfully over the top performance and pulls it off without a hitch.  Lena Headey, playing his Queen does well in a plot line that was written only for the movie to extend her character.  The battle scenes are spectacular and ***warning*** very violent, but not gory.  To me, gory is blood and guts when there isn't any need.  These battles were fought by soldiers who only knew one way to fight; to the death.	5.0	300 Rocks History	2007-07-30	6	6	0

I've seen movies where they tried to weave modern music into period drama movies and the results were most horrible it made you cringe (one movie that comes to mind is the utter waste-of-time, inappropriate and highly embarrassing Keith Ledger vehicle, A Knight's Tale).The acting and the dialog could have been better though but the transformation of the actors in this movie was quite amazing. Gerard Butler appearance in this movie reflected how hard he must have worked to transform himself--I mean even his nose looked totally buffed up -- like a boxer's nose. I couldn't barely recognize him compare to the musical he stared in the ""Phantom of the Opera.""  The underrated Stephen McHattie was great as the loyalist who helps the queen gain access to the Council. David Wenham (who was the gentle yet brave Faramir in the Lord of the Rings trilogy) is the storyteller here. Pretty boy- Rodrigo Santoro looks simply amazing as the gigantic and totally corrupt Xerxes.As far as the historical fact are concerned that some people are talking about, let me say this movie doesn't portray the events accurately, the Persian Empire WAS an empire constantly looking to expand AND take over other countries. This is how they became so big. They ALWAYS had their eyes on the Mediterranean coast because it was the ""Prime Real estate"" of the time. I mean they lived in deserts. The Mediterranean was like paradise for them. One problem though. They never made it through. They tried many times, but their efforts always came to a bloody end, the moment they reached Greece. The movie (though loosely) is based on only one of those battles. Their navy got obliterated in many occasions, as did their armies. This is a Movie. As such, and as the countless movies made based on battles, you will see exaggerations. Personally, I would have preferred the movie to be longer, allowing for some better character development, maybe even a bit darker without some it's non-humorous one liners. Other than that what can I say this movie was great!"	4.0	Beautiful...... simply beautiful!	2007-03-22	7	4	3
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3EDDT3FGGZH6B	Jenny Rose	300 tells you a little about Spartans and how they are selected and trained as warriors. King Leonidas takes 300 of the best warriors to fight the Persians supposedly against the wishes of the Oracle.There is no character arc and little story at all. It's war with lots of visual and sound effects of slicing, dicing, and blood splatter. There were some scenes that I found disturbingly weird like the Persian king's harem tent.If you're into movies for effects, you might like it.

This was a magnificient film.  Mr. Snyder did an excellent job.  I was in total awe through the entire film.  I did not find the violence that graphic or hard to take.  The carnage that took place at the time of the actual battle was much, much worse.  The battle scenes were so stylized it was like watching a ballet.  There was no more violence is this movie than in ""Troy"" or ""King Arthur"" or ""Alexander"".  ""Alexander"" was a blood bath which I never even finished.Mr. Butler is an excellent actor and one of the few who can convey emotion through his eyes.  Ms. Headey as Queen Gorgo was a stroke of genius.I saw this movie three times with my husband and we both enjoyed it immensely all three times.I care not that the facts were not accurate and the film did not lead me to think of modern day problems and/or politics.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2R8F23VCZHB7M	Jeremy Bailey	"First of all, I tried to keep an open mind about this movie, despite the fact I don't care for these old fashion sort of battles, the spears, all the blood. Maybe that's it, the movies show too much blood, getting stabbed, etc. I was a little surprised this wasn't too bad compared to something like Braveheart (in terms of blood and how gory it is; but then again, it's been awhile since I saw Braveheart, so maybe I'm wrong).But, where is the story? Where is the character development? I understand, fight to no longer be slaves, but still, there must be more. And who are these people? A queen, a king, some god, and a lot of people who fight. There was so little character development. I finally knew who one person was just because he's the one with some cloth wrapped around his eye.And the blood/CGI, ugh. Not good. Too fake and pointless. Maybe that's why it seemed easier to sit through this than Braveheart.And the battles? I've seen commercials last longer than that. Now I am no big action sort of guy in films, but it's nice at times, and this was just flat out horrible.The ending was short too. I like why he did what he did (won't say much, don't want to spoil it), but that was about it.And this nude sex bit. It really isn't that bad. Personally, I don't quite understand why this country is so touchy about sex and nudity, as if it's bad to make love to your spouse, but it's OKAY to stab someone through their heart, and decapitate them. ""I know honey, you prefer us to beat each other up and have our own blood bath, and I know it's worse to ask this, but can we have sex? I know it's worse! It's horrible, so shameful! but please?"" 'rolls eyes' But that's beside the point.The point here, the movie was done poorly.The story wasn't strong enough, you didn't know the people too well (guess that's no longer important in films), the blood/CGI was weak, battle scenes ended so quickly. Reminded me of the movie Doom. Through all those battles, and no blood stains on the warriors, yeah that makes sense. I go to work, fairly clean place, and yet I come home from the factory with dust, yet all these people fight and no blood.Oh well, that's not important, right? Who cares. just sit down and watch some movie that shows breasts, sex, violence and blood.I was expecting more than what I got here. Grab the 'History Channel' special on the 300. I'm sure it's better than this."	1.0	Felt like 300 Minutes	2007-09-09	50	24	26

Snyder is great, and I'm looking forward to Watchmen.  But this disc... I had terrible strobing / white dots popping in the image.  This was in the background / areas of high grain / and areas with subtle gradients.  This is a problem some people seem to have and not have.  I guess I got unlucky with this disc.  I have seen this image distortion on the Planet Earth BRD, but only for a few shots.  For 300, this was happening throughout the whole film, making it almost unbearable to watch.  I'm assuming it's a manufacturing issue.  A damn shame too, considering the work that goes into a movie like this.	1.0	Great movie, terrible Blu-Ray... unfortunately.	2008-03-18	35	19	16

Gerard Butler enacts his role of a lifetime with savage brilliancy. He doesn't just act it, he looks incredibly heroic, as does the rest of this extraordinary cast. You soon forget about the technical genius that brings all of this to life. You become enmeshed in the thrilling story-line and the lives of the characters.

The DVD worked great.  I enjoyed the movie.  300 is a very violent movie, but I knew that before I purchased the movie.  The setting is in the past.  As a history buff, I enjoyed the dramatization of an infamous battle between ancient cultures.  The Spartians were portrayed as protectors or what they loved.  They loved their families, their land (property), and freedom.  For these reasons I felt 300 was a politically conservative movie.  I prefer the term: ""freedom-loving"", I think it is more appropriate.  The error in the movie is that the enemy of Sparta: Xerxes, the Persian king.  In the biblical book of Esther, Xerxes prays to God, praises God's wisdom and submits to God's sovereignty.  The movie portrays Xerxes as a king styled like pre-Christian Rome: the god-king.  I understand why 300 would want to make the villian evil and daunting, but making a Persian general evil may have been more historically accurate."	4.0	Review of 300 DVD Purchase	2009-06-05	1	0	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3UI8WGON59OB5	"J. Hoffman ""Go Steelers!!!"""	Based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley, 300 takes over the screen like an invading horde. With all the gushing blood of a horror movie and the scope of a classic epic, the second film from Zack Snyder (who helmed the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead) is an impressive visual spectacle. Gerard Butler plays Leonidas, the king of ancient Sparta. The city is famous for its warrior philosophy, and Leonidas won't kneel to the demands of Persia's King Xerxes. Instead, Leonidas leads his 300-strong army against Xerxes's army of millions.With its gore and scale, 300 marks director Snyder as a possible successor to Peter Jackson's throne.  The huge fights in 300 rival Jackson's efforts in the Lord of the Rings films.  Though the cast doesn't boast any A-list stars, the actors ably fill their larger-than-life roles.  Though there are scenes that demonstrate the humanity of the characters, 300 is undeniably about bravery and blood, and it succeeds because of the stylish depictions of both.	5.0	Tonight...We dine in HELL!!!	2008-12-02	1	1	0

That's basically all you really need to know about the plot. The movie is just a brutally violent epic battle film mostly. With some villians that look so horribly diseased that they look like creatures. The film is more of a fantasy than Gladiator or Brave Heart. It does have scenes that seem like they came right from both films though. For instance the very end is exactly like the end of Brave Heart and like Gladiator you have those dream like sequences of fields with people walking in them with wind blowing in their hair. Plus they even try a lot to make Gerald Butler look like Russel Crowe.Still though despite minor rip-offs from other movies this film works great on it's own. It's exciting and super cool and hard to keep your eyes off it even when heads are flying around. Plus even if Butler channels Crowe's performance from Gladiator it's still an impressivle performance. In no other movie with him, have I seen him own the screen the way he does here. So I think it's a shame that most critics that see the film don't even mention him since this is a real break-out performance for him.	4.0	A Super Cool and Brutally Violent Macho Epic!	2007-04-04	8	5	3

(Edmund Burke)I know of no military service member who would want to be at war when he/she could be at home with family.I'm sure my dad felt that way when he sailed the China sea and watched bodies float down the Yantzee river after a terrible flood in China.I'm sure my Uncle Randolph felt that way as a paratrooper in World War II as he watched Japanese soldiers jump to their deaths to avoid capture.My Uncle Walt in France during World War I. My distant Cousin George at San Juan Hill. My 5th Great Grandfather Robert in the Revolutionary War. I would imagine dying a hero meant nothing when I'm sure he would have been much happier at home.I often wonder if they all understood the price of freedom. That sometimes pivotal events take place, and we can act. Or, we can stand on the sidelines.What if everyone wanted to stand on the sidelines? What would it really mean to our freedom?I wonder if the Spartans knew what their sacrifice would really mean almost 3,000 years later?Every once in awhile a historical event occurs that has the power to change the future forever. Such is the Battle at Thermopylae.In 480 BC, the Medes-Persian emperor Xerxes planned an invasion of the countries that now form the modern day Greece. He needed ""earth and water"" to continue his campaigns, and the Greeks stood in the way.Specifically, the Spartans. Sparta, like all the Greek nations of the time, was democratic and autonomous. They had no intention of relinquishing that autonomy to a tyrant like Xerxes.King Leonidas, one of the two hereditary kings of Sparta, decided the Spartans had to take a stand. Although he couldn't take the full Spartan Army with him because of a festival taking place in Sparta, he chose to take action anyway.He chose 300 ""Sires"" for his unit. Sires were men who had sons to carry on the family name, as well as assume responsibility for the families left behind.The king and his small army met Xerxes and his million at Thermopylae, a narrow pass that led to Central Greece.By taking a stand at the pass, Leonidas coul negate Xerxes's millions and hold off Xerxes's army indefinitely.The fighting was brutal. Xerxes's army suffered heavy losses, even when he sent in his elite troops, the Immortals.The Spartans were defeated on the third day when they were betrayed by a man from one of the local villages. He led the Persians through a goat path and around the Spartans.And so the Spartans lost, and they all died.But that's not the end of the story. On the surface, they did lose. They were wiped out. Xerxes's army got past them.Because of the sacrifice of the Spartans, it led to what happened next. And what happened next changed the course of history. Not only did it lead to Greek victory, but it preserved democracy.The Greeks rallied. One year later, they defeated Xerxes. He never recovered. 150 years later, Alexander the Great would defeat the entire Persian empire and become the dominant force in the world. Greek culture would spread over the known world, and any influence of the Medes-Persian empire would be reduced to ashes.Over 2,000 years later, democratic principles are still the dominant force in the world. The East has never successfully invaded the West.That's the history, and the backdrop for the movie. Although that's what happened in the movie, the movie was much more dramatic.The movie itself is based on the graphic novel by Frank Mills. The movie is basically shot scene for scene based on the graphic novel, and all of the backgrounds are done on blue screen.Unlike Spiderman, which had some of the worst transitions I've ever seen, this movie is so visually stunning you are compelled to watch every scene.The actors are captivating as one facial expression says more than an entire monologue. The one liners are excellent and add a comic element to what is often a serious moment.Lena Heady as the Spartan queen is as beatiful as she is strong, and Gerard Butler plays a handsome Leonidas who needs few words as his expressions say it all.To paraphrase my daughter, ""You wouldn't associate compassion or gentleness with Spartans. You could see from the way they looked at each other though, that it was there. These were people who loved one another. They just had a different way of showing it.""One thing I did find striking was the bold differences between good and evil, between the Spartans and the Persians, and this is a story of good versus evil.All of the Spartans were beautiful to the point of being magnificent. The men were really manly, and they exuded a strength you don't see in the politically correct version of men today.The Persians stood in stark contrast to the Spartans. I saw ugliness there, something often beastly, something that made me feel that nothing good would come of the situation if the Persians won.And Xerxes is arrogant to the point of making you want to hate him. Xerxes was too arrogant though, and Leonidas taught him that all men can bleed, even those who claim to be a god.To be honest, even though I thought the telling of this story would be superficial, I still wanted to see it. What I found instead is a movie where it's so visually stunning, with acting that's well done, and every element in the movie contributes to a fair, accurate, and deep story telling of a serious subject for a movie.This is movie making at its best, and I hope Hollywood will take note. Although graphic at times, the graphic sexual and violent elements contribute in a meaningful way to the overall telling of the story. These elements allow you to see what life was really like for these people and how life can be tough no matter what your station in life.Even though this story has been told before in the movie, ""The 300 Spartans"", I'm glad to see it's been told again. This time, it's being told on a deeper, richer, and more meaningful level.I recommend this movie is for anyone who understands the high price of freedom and knows it must be paid. For those who don't get it, like the story of Huckleberry Finn, it can still be enjoyed as just another larger than life story and a truly great movie."	5.0	Well Told Story for Our Times	2009-04-22	2	2	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2WHCMMS9KZU90	J. Miller	I saw this movie at the theatre and absolutely loved it. It is definitely a guys movie...lots of fighting, blood, warriorism. Heck, pretty much every woman in the movie shows her breasts...what more could a guy ask for?Honestly though, I would give this movie 4.5 stars if I could. The main reason being the movie (HD) quality. Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the DVD, it's just they way the movie was produced...it doesn't take advantage of HD.

I saw the movie in the theatre on opening night and the picture was clearer on my screen at home.The effects, though artsy are incredible!The acting is solid, they manage to put enough comedy into the film to keep it light, and though this doesn't add any points to the film, this is best watched without thinking about anything. There are plenty of areas (well, most of the movie really) where you have to forget your history and not even consider realism. It's based on a graphic novel, which is so loosely based on history that it should be said, ""suggested by real events"" or ""inspired by historic events"".But it's a fun movie, start to finish and absolutely entertaining."	5.0	This movie RULES.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A246DPGDMYPQ0K	J. Ocampo	"It was an enjoyable film because there were excellent battle scenes between the Spartans and the hordes of Persians.  I love movies like Braveheart that have huge battle scenes between historic armies.  This movie gave me what I wanted, epic clashes between two ancient and determined fighting forces.  Movies with great action are lacking these days and chick flicks are taking over.  It was nice to see a movie that defied this trend.Just to make sure that the movie doesn't bother you, I will review three characteristics of the movie that seem to inflame a lot of people.  They are:  the historical accuracy (or lack of accuracy) of the movie, the sight of muscular men, and the politically incorrect message.As for the historical accuracy, even the well-read amongst us are not commonly versed with the specific details of ancient battles.  However, it was still obvious that some of the tactics that the Spartans used resembled matrix-style superman fighting rather than actual ancient battle tactics.  Still, the action was great.  There were plenty of sword-fighting, spears being thrust, arrows zinging, hell, there were even attack Elephants and wizards throwing ancient fire bombs.  Yeah, it might not have been 100% accurate, but it is an action movie, not a history channel documentary.  For action, it gets 10 out of 10.In regards to the second problem, a lot of people, mostly male viewers, are complaining because all of the Spartans had muscular physiques and wore a small amount of clothing.  If you are a modern man, metrosexual or otherwise, and as a result you are too ""catty"" to see men who are more buffed than yourself, then maybe you should avoid this movie.The last problem is the message.  This message is about about bravery and being willing to fight for the cause.  This upsets a lot of people in this day of age when empty things like bravado are shunned.  If you detest movies that celebrate patriotism, defiance, an utter determination in the face of adversity and foreign invasion, then you might find this movie to be offensive.On the other hand, if you appreciate a good action flick and liked movies like Braveheart, then this movie is highly recommended."	5.0	Great Action and Message	2007-08-07	5	3	2

I've come to expect some historical inaccuracies in movies, which is fine as long as they are not too eggregious and the story is good, but this movie had them in spades.  The movie ""Gladiator"" was flawed but was vastly superior and far more enjoyable than this flick.  I was pleased that they got the Spartan training right, yet what was up with this film?  Am I watching the re-telling of a true historical event or a cheap knock-off of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy?  Every bad character was depicted as some kind of demon and there were monsters in this.  Say what?!?  The real story of the Battle of Thermopylae is one of the greatest from the ancient world, with real characters that still inspire people to this day.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A23OB9FM3MUYXT	John du Prey	"The ancient warrior Hellion would have enjoyed the brutality, warrior credo, and undying loyalty to country and nobility under threat - in the epic, graphic masterpiece ""300"". Written by Frank Miller; directed by Zack Snyder; starring Gerard Butler (as King Leonidas), Lena Neadey (as Queen Gorgo), voice-over narrative by David Wenham (as Dilios). and Rodrigo Santoro (as Xerxes). Premise: King Leonidas leads 300 Spartans against an army of one million soldiers, who seek to ravage and enslave Sparta and Greece. Themes: freedom & tyranny, sacrifice on the battlefield, extreme heroism that has inspired warriors throughout the centuries, and a just cause to defend one's own home country from invaders. Our empathy runs strong. Our catharsis is assured. We care what happens.We can identify with these warriors on many levels. Their sacrifice of life itself ennobles their place in history. This film has high-end epic drama-type acting & physicality, Shakespearean dialogue, horrific battle scenes, deceit, betrayal, treason underfoot, treachery, seamless & robust film editing, fierce as possible close combat scenarios that deserve repeated viewing, and early on sensuality - prior to the first battles between the 300 Spartans and their adversaries at the Hot Gates (Thermopylae).This film has fire & death, shield & sword, true heroism pitted against impossible odds - the likes of which warriors - tamed and untamed, trained, seasoned by uncommon valor & combat, worn thin by hypocrisy, glad for battle to freshen the senses and sharpen one's fighting prowess - can draw from the well of battle history in order to remain a true fighting unit under one commander. An exceptional action movie. All unities adhered to. The crescendo ran like a jolt of electricity from the opening scenes where King Leonidas sends the messengers of Xerxes to their death in the pit until the 300 Spartans face their final battle unto death. It struck a chord throughout the world, echoing universal themes that are held dear. These words from the only warrior left alive from the original 300 Spartans rings true to this day:Dilios: ""This day we rescue a world from mysticism and tyranny!"""	5.0	John du Prey - Classical Review	2012-04-07	1	0	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2UQLGSSAWCL8O	John G. Lawson	The battle of Thermopylae was very thoroughly documented by Roman historians, but this special effects bombshell hardly resembles the actual facts of that most important land battle in history. Couching dialog in hip modern terms that a younger audience can quickly understand and relate to is not HISTORY, it is HISTORY-LIKE.The armor is an invention of Hollywood prop suppliers and not authentic. The depiction of battles deteriorates into bedlam and street fighting techniques.Various characters were given dialog and action not consistent with historical facts.I watched it once and relegated it to the dumpster, where it belongs with all of the other modern Hollywood political propaganda.	1.0	Poliitical Correctness and Poetic License	2007-09-02	31	14	17

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	"I have never read Frank Miller's original graphic novel nor have I seen a film directed by Zack Snyder before. All I can say is thank you to both men for having the courage and excellent artistic craft for telling such a spellbinding tale about free men battling against an evil empire inspite of impossible odds. ""300"" is one of the most realistic films I have seen depicting Ancient Greek civilization, especially in its successful effort at humanizing the valiant, war-like Spartans (EDITORIAL NOTE: Having been immersed in the histories of Sparta and Athens thanks to authors as diverse as Steven Pressfield and Victor Davis Hanson, I do think that both Zack Snyder and Frank Miller have successfully portrayed ancient Sparta in this engrossing tale, in stark contrast to a comment listed below.). The cast is superb, with Gerard Butler as a memorable King Leonidas and David Wenham as Dilios (He's probably best known for his portrayal of Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.), the Spartan warrior who narrates the saga, and finally, leads the Greeks on to a final victory against the Persians at the Battle of Plataea, nearly a year after the heroic last stand by the Spartans at Thermopylae. Although I will acknowledge that there are some scenes which are reminiscient of those in Japanese ninja films or ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, virtually the entire film is depicted with ample realism, demonstrating both the military excellence of Leonidas's band of 300 and the lavish, morally bankrupt military camp of the Persian army. This is one of the finest war movies I have ever seen, which not only shows the horrors of war, but more importantly, explains why it is necessary sometimes to fight - and to die - in defense of one's homeland and liberty. However, in light of the excessive bloody gore - which is depicted realistically - I would recommend that only older children in the company of their parents should see it."	5.0	Superb, Intensely Violent Film Which Remains Historically True.....	2007-03-13	17	11	6

Zack Snyder (of ""Dawn of the Dead 2004"" fame) faithfully brings the instant classic graphic novel to life thanks to excellect diretion, good acting and tons of spectacular visual effects mixing the film in live-action and CGI animation much like LOTR.

Oh I've never seen so many specimens of manhood bound up in one movie. I like to sit and watch this movie in my Spartan costume and prance around the house like Caligula!!! During the battle scenes I enjoy pulling on my nipple rings and bending myself over the coffee table for a spanking. My biggest complaint is that in this movie they did not show the Spartans engaging in homosexual sex with each other. They did that you know. That;s why they were such fierce warriors. On the battlefield they protected not only their brothers and fellow warriors, but their lovers.Still this movie is just a tad bit far fetched. I did not know that Xerxes had monsters fighting for him. Nor did I realize he had a mutant executioner. Xerxes was a fine fine girly man. His piercings made my knees weak.Still I wonder why this whole movie was shot on a green screen. It just made the movie seem that much more fake when you add the fact they also had a giant killer rhinoserus, and characters that looked like they came out of Mortal Kombat. This movie ended up looking more and more like a video game. In fact I'm curious now to see how long it will take XBOX to release a 300 game. But I did like the fact that it was narrated in much the same manner as Conan the Barbarian with Arnold.Throw in some more scenes with tight manly buttocks to go along with those abs next time.

How is it cool to watch?If you got got a huge spear and shield and starting stabbing people armed only with letter openers and sticks would you then be awesome?Also, apparently giving King Leonidas a back massage makes Xerxes super evil and a wonderful villain.Then there's the most astounding display of courage yet: pushing an unarmed messenger into a pit for absolutely no reason!Next, the characters.  King Leonidas has a spear, a shield, muscles, and a penis.  But the actor forgot that he actually had to act to make a convincing hero.  And his face on the box cover is just so intimidating and heroic.All the other Spartans are flat.  They kill people and get killed, but since there's no connection to them, I can't sympathize with their cause.The action is actually decent, but then we have the incredibly important political sub-plot.  Everyone really wants to take a break from the battle to know what is happening back in Sparta.  The sex scene was also absolutely essential to the plot.Why are random people so ugly in this movie?  Why is there a random crab arm guy? Why is the screen always have an unnatural red tint?This movie makes no sense.  I was happy when the Spartans finally died.  For people that enjoy the action, I can understand that, but the people that think it's epic and a great story with excellent plot, what is wrong?Since when is this garbage an excellent movie?	1.0	I don't understand what people see in this movie.	2009-10-09	19	5	14

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A75MSQQ3LN86Z	Josef Bush	"This remarkable and inspirational film is a literal tranlatrion from a visual novel or comic book format novel based on the famous stand of Leonidas King of Sparta and his small army of volunteers at the pass of Thermopyle.  Because the director chose to make his movie resemble the picture/novel, it is not a life-like film, though close to that, but somehow, far more intense.  As in the original artwork, non-important details of background, character and plot and even of situation, are eliminated, and this elimination of detail allows us to focus all our attention on the power of the story.  And, it becmes all the more powerful because the story is true;  Leonidas did lead his men against the overwhelming masses of the Persian invaders, and although the Spartans did not stop the ivasion, they delayed it for a time, thereby teaching the invaders that conquest of the Greek city-states would cost them far more than they imagined.As one would expect in a comic book or visual format devoted to the struggles of heroes, the Greek warriors are shown as a band of supremely beautiful, athletic and muscular athletes.  Physical magnificence overwhelms almost everything.  That kind of magnificence fiits the Greek tradition which says that proud nakedness is a sign of courage; even of sanctity.  That's why the statues of Greek heroes are shown naked, or in the originals, wearing helmets but holding nothing but their lances.  Bravery requires no covering.  Logic suggests that the actors in this film, to be true to history and tradition, would be both naked and magnificent.  But, present reality being what it is, a film of frank nakedness certainly wouldn't be distributed in this country, and besides, it is virtually inconceivable that an entire cast of perfectly matched fine specimens of masculinity could be found; therefore, we bow to the costumer's decision to clothe the performers in something like leather Speedos, and the animator's decision to use digital techniques to multiply on screen many ""copies"" of one or wo archetypes, and to animate them endlessly.  But all this is done with such facility that in only a few seconds of watching the film one is unconscious of the effort to achieve the effects, and engrossed in a forever-engrossing story.  It is the equivalent of doing on tape what Greek sculptors did during the Helenistic age when they carved the famous Altar at Pergamum.  The figures are exagerated and many are naked, details are eliminated, and the emotional and physical exertion of the warriors in their battle dominates one's perception; the marble seems to sweat, to bleed, and we can almost hear screams issuing from some of the faces of the wounded and dying.There's another version of this story available and for rent; THE THREE HUNDRED SPARTANS.  You can find it at Critics Choice or any number of othe sources.  Although it was made three or four decades ago, it was a well made Hollywood technicolor film and is an excellent and realistic re-enactment of the incident at Thermopalye.  Matter of fact, it migt be of some use to compare the two versions.  If you do you'll see that in this newer but more abstract version, Persia and the Persian King is not shown as a real or historic indiidual, but rather as a symbolic figure on a rich and fantastic catafalque who represents not the king, but tyrany and slavery and abject surrender, for to the Spartans the warriors of the King are seen as slaves.  And the Spartans distinguish themselves as free men who will never surrender themselves or allow themselves to be enslaved.  Of course its done with a kind of confrontation of physiques as one might see it in a wrestling ring, when a big baddie associated in name and style with death and perversity, confronts a clean or at least cleaner cut athlete who fights honorably and represents all the cheering audience thinks of as good and worthy, wihin themselves.To get an idea of the story is easy enough: many commentators have described it in detail, so there's no need for me to go into it here.  There are not many characters, for the plot is lean.  Thre's a heroine, a villanous traitor on the front and another in the Spartan council chamber.  But, nothing described by anybody here can adequately convey the power of the story; its effect is electric and rousing beyond almost anything you can imagine.  Irrational though it may be, it is as though some part of Leonidas' courage manages to get itself itno your bloodstream and there to mingle with your hormones and genes in such a way as to nullify all the petty slights, insults and compromises we undergo every day, and to allow us to touch the fuel source of the flame of manhood that burns within us all.  It is a celebration:  At a time of so many ignoble compromises, a triumph.  Call it a seance, if you like.  Or a testosterone high.  Or think of it as the pep talk of a great coach in the smelly locker room of conflict.  Call on your memories of General Patton and imagine why his army held him in such high esteem.  Or, if you like, consider it a specific against the endlessly onanistic Politically Correct bilious whining of those who don't either respect themselves or like men, and who hate raising boys."	5.0	SHOW THIS TO YOUR SONS IF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SONS	2008-12-12	3	2	1

Instead he and 300 committed spartan warriors travel to meet the enourmous persian army to stand in its way of taking control of Sparta. Battle scenes are some of the best out there.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AW3BDUZUFZMFX	Joshua T. Garcia	300 is not a historically accurate depiction of the Battle of Thermopylae--certainly everyone has realized that by now. This film is extremely stylistic, with a heavy use of green screen to simulate dramatic lighting and employ heavy amounts of CGI (there are plenty of ridiculous CGI blood splatters that simply vanish into thin air). Everyone in the film, even the Spartan politicians, is about as physically toned as is possible for a human, and the Spartans forsake battle armor to show off their hairless sculpted torsos.300, based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, is kind of ridiculous. It's completely over-the-top. It seems like an homage to masculinity. And yet, as much as I want to laugh at it and dismiss it as stupid fun (which is easily done with the sequel, Rise of an Empire), this is actually an excellent film with some amount of depth to it.No, King Leonidas probably didn't fight a giant CGI wolf as a boy, but this film is extremely successful in conveying the mindset of the ancients--their perceptions of an enemy, their need for honor and glory, their dedication to their nations, their struggle to understand the world around them, and their devotion to camaraderie and brotherhood. As the film portrays, this ancient mindset was often forged in conjunction with death, battle, and sacrifice. The style used in this film helps, rather than hinders, the conveyance of an ancient Spartan worldview.That the movie managed to convey these themes while being entertaining, quotable, heavily stylized, and overall cheesily awesome is what makes it a success.	5.0	Over-The-Top Machismo Fantasy...Yet Fantastic	2014-03-25	1	1	0

The movie relies heavily on CGI cinematography, violent battle scenes, extravagant characters and nudity to hide its paper thing story. There is no Gladiator-like storytelling here--the plot is just secondary in a film that was meant mostly for the XboX 360 generation.Story:The city of Sparta is under siege after a messenger from the Persian Empire, insinuates to King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) that Spartans should surrender to his Persian God-like king. This kind of insult doesn't go well for the Spartan king who kills all these little messengers on the spot. Unfortunately, he knows that war is imminent and needs to be prepared. After consulting his military strategies to some wise deformed men (on the top of a mystic mountain), he decides to go on and take the battle to the Persians--they did not agree with any of his intentions. He manages to recruit 300 of his finest warriors to battle against a million. He says good bye to his beautiful wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) and his young son. Then, he marches on to a battle that could be his last. The 300 Spartans go to war, despite some internal opposition to do so.Review:In the technical department, 300 will probably please most of its younger audience. The surreal-like environment where the story takes place gives us the ""look and feel"" of the epic graphic novel--something that fans will probably enjoy. Intense computer graphics are needed to create this almost alien-like ancient world. The battle scenes are intense and well choreographed with plenty of slow motion, computer gore and eye candy landscapes. If you're never seen the trailer or read the graphic novel, you might be annoyed by how the whole thing looks. We think that the movie looks like a video game.Director Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead) shows virtually nothing about the Spartan people other than their king and his six-pack super warriors who want glory by dying in battle--we just get an intro about how ""early"" they begin to train as soldiers. Most of the characters are reduced to video game figures that only purpose in life is war and cheesy dialogue. Their enemies are even more extravagant--some of them are very bizarre. No matter how much Mr. Snyder wants to inject some melodramatic moments, the movie is reduced to cool-looking battle scenes and sexy bodies, nothing more.The Verdict:There are no history lessons here. It is all about the action and the CGI cinematography--something that has been used a lot lately. 300 is a CGI-driven action film that has plenty of slow-mo battles, lots of skin, but it doesn't have the storytelling of Braveheart or Gladiator."	3.0	300 is a CGI-driven action film	2007-08-10	5	4	1

I had read Herodotus of Halicarnassus' ""Histories"" twice and wonder if ever this will be made into a movie, or at least some parts of it. I had seen ""The 300 Spartans"" but wasn't satisfied with it: the Spartan soldiers looked more like Romans than Lacedemonians (i.e. Spartans). Not until the release of the movie ""300"". To tell you honestly saw the movie thrice and actually enjoyed it, not for its historical accuracy, but for its brazen retelling of the battle at Thermopylae: a brave new world in film making. Awesome graphic effects, outrageous costumes, cool battle scenes choreography, etc... never, never a dull moment! But even before I watch the film for the first time I conditioned myself that this is tightly based on the ""Graphic Novel"" written by Frank Miller and NOT the accounts given by many ancient Greek historians, especially Herodotus, regarding the battle of Thermopylae (the Seventh Book of Herodotus called ""Polymnia"" detailed the accounts of the Persian campaign under Xerxes against Greece). Since I had seen it thrice, I was able to confirm and/or differentiate the existing ancient accounts against the plot and representation of the characters in the movie, hence, the graphic novel from which the film is based. Here are some high-yield, but not exhaustive, comparisons:1. THE LACEDEMONIANS (Spartans). They look convincing in this movie. The hairstyle of king Leonidas and facial hair remind me of those bronze statues recovered from the wreckage of ships now residing in a handful museums in Greece and Italy. The only difference is they don't wear leather ""speedos"", as one reviewer calls it. Of course, the producers wouldn't allow to replicate naked warriors in this movie, so as not to offend our Victorian sensibilities. Then again, should be faithful to Frank Miller.2.  EPHIALTES. The Hunchback of Notre Dame Quasimodo made a retroactive appearance in this movie without Esmeralda. Don't get him wrong. He was a shepherd, as one account puts it, and nothing wrong with his external appearance.3. XERXES. Part Yul Bryner, part drag queen. Substantial piercings, dog collar (where's the leash?), and wearing Victoria secret underwear. Hailed as ""a god"" in the movie, baritone voice-over a-la Darth Vader sans the snorkel effect.  On the walls of Persepolis in Iran he is well covered (with a robe), bearded and, ironically, looks more like Gerard Butler (like Leonidas in the movie!). Official title was Shah-han-shah ""King of Kings"" and not a god. Most Persians were strict Zoroastrians (hence monotheistic). It would be blasphemous if they usurp the title reserved for Ahura-Mazda, even they were members of the Achaemenid royal line.4. THE EPHORS. ""More creatures than men."" Wearing Benedictine habits, cloistered on top of a rocky mountain, riddled with skin disease. Leprosy, I suppose? One audience even asked ""Where do they get their food?"" Smart kid, but don't ask me. Want to spell their name? It's actually E-force. In contrast, the ephors were highly respected men, elected annually, five of them, in charge of civic trials, calendar, foreign policy and military training for young men. Forget the ""drunken adolescent girl"". The oracle was in Delphi attended by priests, not ephors!5. THE IMMORTALS. Teenage mutant ninja turtles complete with samurai katanas (sword). Behind those silvered Peking-opera masks is another import. The Mummy Returns! This time, a thousand times over. If you watch the movie closely, the immortals were depicted accurately in their costumes. Unfortunately, they were thrown down into the well with the doomed African messenger. A problem of transposition. Who gives a rat's patoot about that? THIS IS SPARTA!!!!6. DILIOS. Who? With one eye severed, was sent back to Sparta to rally for Leonidas' cause. Becomes Pausanias at the Battle of Plataea, gives a long speech before breaking ranks (where was the famous phalanx?) to attack the Persians. Spartans were laconic and hated long speeches. Ahem! There were two conflicting accounts regarding this person. One account said he committed suicide (by strangulation) because of ridicule and in the other account joined the other Spartans at Plataea ""to redeem his honor"". Both, curiously, had different names but none was Dilios. Again, Frank Miller's invention.7. OTHER ODDITIES. Monster chopping off heads of generals, ugly people in Xerxes tent, and...and...the thing that really made my jaw drop: a goat/ram playing a flute. Lovely. Where's Babe the piglet? Caught in the battle, perhaps?Having said all these, I will still give this movie 5 stars and congratulate Frank Miller and Zack Snyder for a job well done. This is a fantastic (phantasm) movie which made me laugh, frown, sneer, sneeze, jump off my seat, clear my throat, put my hand on my mouth, bite my fingernails and cry at the end, all within the spectrum of human emotion. Only a handful of films could elicit that! Hey, this is just a comic book made into a movie and Herodotus wouldn't mind. Remember famous stories made into Disney movies: talking gargoyles, singing teacups, etc? If they buy those kinds of movies, why not buy and watch this one?

Recio	"Since here in Mexico HD format is difficult and expensive to get i decided to get this movie from amazon.Though not an outstanding film, 300 delivers a visual feast of coolness and beauty. Some may argue that everything is CG, so what! Nowadays i'd consider CGI a form of new art. This is the kind of movie to have and see in HD. The extras are okay, they give you a broader picture of the production and a little bit of facts and legend about the spartans, pretty cool! There's also a strategy game where you play the role of Leonidas. Just a couple of drawbacks (no big deal, though), first there's a ""behind the scenes"" section, but it is in 6X motion! bad idea... you can't see a thing and it has an annoying background song; second, the double format, i don't like double sided cd's since you have to be two times more careful with them."	4.0	Cool movie and format	2007-08-23	0	0	0

The 300's courage of death in the name of freedom is remembered for all time.  ""We are Spartans"" is a phrase as immortalized as ""Remember the Alamo"" in a similar battle here in Texas.  The animation is top notch in this movie and to the people who complain about the graininess of the picture it is this way in the theater--it is intentional.  It is the same way in other theater released films like Beowulf.  300 is intended for an audience that wants to see action and death(Rambo, Gladiator, etc.).This movie is pure action at its best."	5.0	We are Spartans	2008-01-26	1	0	1
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A188TUOC97TW19	Judith Habeeb	"No, I don't have a spectacular quote from the movie ""300"" in my review. There were plenty of them, that's for sure. Somewhere between Gerald Butler sputtering inspirational lines and endless bloody battles, Zack Snyder's adaption of Frank Miller's graphic novel happened to cross the line and not only beat ""Troy"" for the spot as the best epic war movie, but also beat ""The Matrix"" movies and take the gold as the best action movie ever made. While the action sequences seem original with their bloody slow motion swordplay and a red sky, they are actually expansions on what we saw in ""The Matrix"" films. For example, in the beginning action sequence of the original ""Matrix"", Carrie-Ann Moss' character was in mid-air just still for a few seconds. While none of that is in ""300"", you easily get the sense that ""The Matrix"" gave a lot of inspiration for this film. Yet in  a way the battle sequences seem so original, maybe because we've not seen stuff like this in recent epic movies like ""Troy"", ""Gladiator"", or ""King Athur"". In the end, it doesn't matter how unrealistic or how out-of-this-world the film was. In the end, the world saw a complete masterpiece from Zack Snyder, who directed the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake. As an added bonus to the spectacular motion picture, Warner Bros. has included a wonderful two-disc special edition. On the first disc, Snyder has a sole yet very informative commentary. On disc two, there are many great making-of features including webisodes. The only thing left out of this are the two very great trailers for ""300"". This is a definate purchase for any action fan or any fan of the Wackoski Brothers (I think that's how you spell)."	5.0	I don't have a great quote as the start of my review	2008-05-30	2	1	1

This film, done with the magic of the green screen, was created to bring to life the infamous Frank Miller graphic novel, not to illustrate a point in history.

But when I bought my Xbox 360 HD DVD attachment, I had to get this movie in HD. Only store that stocked it had a HD DVD/DVD combo disc. HD DVD owners: this is the only combo disc that didn't work in my 360 HD DVD drive (and I was so annoyed at Major Nelson's interview video from Xbox Live after I realized it didn't work--did it somehow work for him and why didn't it work for me?)I tried to access Warner's customer support both online and by phone and neither gave me a satisfactory answer (a live person couldn't call me for at least 4 weeks). I also went to Microsoft Xbox support both online and by phone, and the phone operator had me troubleshoot every hardware option but no success. Finally, I tried downloading to CD the May 2007 HD DVD update from Xbox Live and updated the HD DVD player firmware. Popped in the disc--success! The next day when I tried it again though, it just kept coming up on the Dashboard as ""Unplayable Disc."" Tried updating firmware again but was unsuccessful. The standard DVD side worked throughout all of this trouble though. I even tried returning the disc at the place of purchase for another one and experienced the same problems.My recommendation is to purchase the straight HD DVD disc and skip the Combo at all costs."	2.0	Movie great; HD DVD owners beware!	2007-12-27	4	2	2

And that's the fact that I think most people are overlooking when they talk about how 300 the movie is commenting on our current political situation.  It's based on a graphic novel that was published in 1999.  That's before 9/11, before the Iraq war, before the war on terrorism, before Islamo-fascism was is most Americans' vocabularies.  It was written as a cool, bloody story about how 300 Spartans kicked butt, and just because it parallels current events doesn't mean it's in response to them.  Now I know what you're thinking.  Did Zack Snyder make the movie now because of this parallel?  I don't know.  What I do know is that the movie follows the graphic novel pretty much word for word (except for the business with the queen)and it's a kick-butt adaptation of a kick-butt graphic novel and a truly breathtaking work of art, not to mention one of the best times I've had at the theatre this year.  And to lose sight of that in some discussion of political slant is to fail to appreciate a movie by taking it too seriously.	5.0	Great movie, but political?	2007-07-16	14	10	4

Rather it will be a critique about the blu ray movie quality.  This is not the first time I purchased a blu ray movie and was disappointed by the picture quality.  For some reason, when this movie is played, there is a grain pattern throughout the whole picture.  It really makes watching the movie a disappointment.

The HD DVD version of this movie will have lots of nice EXTRAS that the Blu-Ray version won't, because as a lot of people don't know, Blu-Ray is not even FINALIZED yet and all the Extra JAVA features that are needed aren't currently supported and won't ever be on current Blu-Ray players other then the PS3.  Which is also why other movies have been delayed for Blu-Ray while they wait until October 2007 for the format to be Complete since it was Actually Rushed out into the marketplace in basically BETA format.  Movies like Batman Begins and The Matrix are a couple examples.  Others they just leave out the extras on the Blu-Ray version and release just the movie on Blu-Ray, which is what's being done with ""300""The Extra $4 for the HD DVD version over Blu-Ray is not for the extra content, but for being a COMBO disc which includes a DVD version also.  This allows you to play the movie in your DVD players also!!!  Very Reasonable price for that.I just have to laugh at the Blu-Ray sucker fanboys that must be huge DRM (Digital Rights Managment) fans since it has Double that garbage and far more control to do things such as to disable your Blu-Ray player if they think it's been compromised.  All thanks to BD+. Which hasn't been used YET,  Let alone buy a format that's not even finshed yet, just so you can spend a bunch more money to buy another Blu-Ray player a little later.  Advertising features the system just doesn't support yet.  There are still features that will be Optional also even after it's been Finalized in October.  I won't get into it here, but Visit a good Audio/Video Forum and learn more!!!  If you really just have to have Blu-Ray, unless you like throwing money away, WAIT until the new Blu-Ray players finally get released that support the final Specs.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ALLJT7S5QOFFZ	kaduzy	"I've been a BIG fan of this movie ever since it hit theaters, and as soon as the 2-disc special edition DVD became available, I intended to buy it right away. Unfortunately, my finances weren't where I thought they'd be at the time, so when it came out I simply added it to my shopping list and decided to bide my time. My patience paid off, because at one point Amazon was selling this for seven bucks (presumably a Black Friday deal) -- and when I saw that, I bought it immediately, before the price could shoot back up. And thank goodness I did, because if I had paid a penny more for this incredibly disappointing package, I would have been VERY upset.For starters, the DVD I got in the mail did not come with the cardboard packaging that the same 2-disc edition has when I've seen it in retail stores. I'm not sure if that's because Amazon felt that seven bucks didn't cover the price of cardboard, or if maybe that should be a signal to me that the DVD I received isn't actually brand new. Since the disc plays with no problems, I can live with that if it isn't, and I have no problem saving a tree -- but I'll always have to wonder what exactly it is that I paid for.The main problem is that this is simply one of the worst ""special edition"" DVD releases I've ever seen. There aren't enough extras to justify a second disc, by any means. Everything they give you could have fit easily onto a single disc. And ""everything"" consists of two rather short features about the graphic novel, the movie's relation to actual history, and the making of the film.The people who put this DVD together missed a VERY valuable opportunity to really give us an in-depth look at how the unique and often stunning visuals in this movie were created. I was eager to see some of the scenes before computer effects were added, and to watch more in-depth interviews with the cast and crew about the process of putting together this highly entertaining film. Instead, the most in-depth feature offered here is a handful of webisodes that were ALL available online BEFORE the movie was released in theaters!! It's a good bet that anyone who likes the movie enough to have purchased the 2-disc ""special"" edition would have taken the time to see these online already. And even if you're behind the curve a bit, chances are they're still floating around on YouTube some place. That's not to say it isn't nice having them on DVD, but they are no substitute for real content. And more to the point, NONE of these features are worth the normal retail price of this DVD -- in fact, they're barely worth the seven bucks that I paid for it. One feature in particular is almost unbearable. It's called ""The Making of 300 In Images"" and it's literally just a lot of image flashes with some crappy music that go by so quickly that watching it gave me a headache. I would SERIOUSLY recommend that you skip out on this feature if you suffer from epilepsy. I watched it in slow motion, but it was still useless because no one is explaining what exactly is going on in each batch of images.And most damning of all, THERE ARE NO TRAILERS INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE. Considering how much attention the trailers for ""300"" got, it's ludicrous that they're not here. Not only are they fantastic to watch on their own, but I believe they're the main reason this film was so successful.  People like me who aren't into reading graphic novels and had never heard of Frank Miller before ""Sin City"" came out aren't going to be pulled into paying for a movie like this without a fantastic trailer to motivate us. Heck, even my mother wanted to see this movie after she saw the trailer, and she hates violent action movies. So why isn't it here??? I couldn't tell you. All I know is that no matter how much you like this movie, you're better off buying the single-disc edition and saving yourself some money. Thank goodness I only paid seven bucks for my copy! If you can find a similar bargain, then by all means, take advantage. But the bottom line is that a movie this great deserves a better DVD presentation than this, and until they come up with one I suggest you avoid this like the plague itself."	3.0	It was $6.99, but they're out of their minds!	2007-12-04	2	1	1

From the previews, I expected no more than a random, brutal, and stylized action flick, but it still didn't impress. The movie replaced half of the would-be action and violence with a steriotypical story about a soldier giving his life for his family. The movie shoulv'e at least mellowed out the overly-dramatic and soap-opera like emotional dialogue, because it didn't work out very well with the overall presentation of the film. As far as the stylized action goes, the computer-generated blood looks cool as swords impact flesh, but every drop of blood dissapears before it reaches the edge of the screen .Noone wasnts to see an awesome blood spurt fly through the air, and then quickly fade into nothing. This was just downright lame. All of the soldiers would come out of battle clean and blood-spatter free. This is in no way nearly as good as Sin City. Lastly, the movie doesn't feel either visceral nor intense, just clean and full of disapearing blood effects. The movie comes off as lame and cheesy.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	MOVIE: The name Frank Miller has become rather well known over the past few years to a wider audience. After Robert Rodriguez hunted him down to get his approval to do Sin City his graphic novels are now becoming a film genre within themselves. So, with Sin City 2 coming and a 3rd one being planned it was inevitable that some of his other books were to be adapted into films. What Sin City had (besides the awesome Robert Rodriguez directing) was a sense of ultra realism that worked. Rodriguez said he never wanted to adapt the graphic novel into a film, but rather adapt film into a graphic novel. The result was a gritty film noir tale that utilized its style to create vivid and entertaining movie. 300 is a bit different, in fact a lot different. What they did was in fact take the graphic novel and stick into a movie and I can say right here that the visual style is amazing. The film as a narrative is pure crap.Zack Snyder made his film debut by directing the very unnecessary remake of Dawn Of The Dead.  So, did Snyder make a good film with 300? Not at all. The movie is nothing more than yelling and screaming, half naked men, and slow motion killing. It's as if a Ridley Scott epic was sprinkled with crack and dipped into a bucket of sepia paint. The tale is known to all, 300 Spartan soldiers take on one million of the Persian empire in order to defend their nation. All in all, that is exactly what it is with no strings attached. The characters are never established nor are they developed. The film is not emotionally engrossing or exciting because we don't care about these characters. The film is poorly structured so the impact of an impending battle is rather weak. Just compare it to the battle of Return Of The King. Okay, maybe an unfair comparison, but recall how much set-up and anticipation was had before the first sword was swung. Recall the first scene of Gladiator, before our characters were even established there was incredible anticipation and set-up before the battle. Snyder thrusts us into slow motion spear stab after slow motion spear stab. I swear, if this movie wasn't shot on digital they would have used all the film in the world because of all the high frame rates required for slow motion. I am not exaggerating when I say that probably 50% of this movie is slow motion, even the sex scene is slow motion. The movie is one crowning achievement in visual style, but for what purpose?The only commercial appeal this movie has is its visual style, which sole credit goes to Frank Miller and Frank Miller alone. If only they used that visual style in a more cinematic way I think the film could have been so much more. The only focus here are the battle scenes, and while stunningly choreographed and amazingly shot they serve no purpose in the narrative. Another complaint I had was Tyler Bates' score. As a Hans Zimmer idolizer I love electronic and synthesized scores, but too much of anything can be bad. There are no thematic cues in the entire film and while Bates prove he can write grand and testosterone filled pieces he never structures them thematically. He even resorts to pure rock and roll at certain points in the film.  All I heard was a composer trying to replicate the masterful success of Hans Zimmer and his fellow composers. There was a lot of Black Hawk Down in that score and a lot of Harry Gregson-Williams' style from Kingdom Of Heaven. Bates just scrambled it in together to make it as loud as the visuals. The movie is a spectacular mess, and I know about 90% of the people who read this review will disagree with me. It's not that I think the film should have been more intellectual to be better, it's just it was poorly structured and not engrossing as a narrative, and by the end all I had was a headache.ACTING: The film boasts a relatively unknown cast. David Wenham is probably the most recognizable since he played Faramir in Return Of The King. Dominic West plays a corrupt politician (yes, the movie tries to be political for about 2 minutes) and he is probably most recognizable from his roles in Chicago or the HBO series The Wire. Gerard Butler plays the king of Sparta and he does have a strong presence. Even though the movie is all shouting he does a good job as the anchor of it all. He is from Scotland so at times I felt like I was listening to a young Sean Connery, but I liked him in the role. The movie really only demanded physical fitness from the actors since there was little room to show what they could do.BOTTOM LINE: Go ahead, disagree with me all you like but you have to admit that the visual effects are the only drawing point of this movie.  Zack Snyder has proven he can make something look good with a computer, but he hasn't proven that he is a good filmmaker yet.  Anyone can look at a picture and try to do the best they can to trace the lines and come up with something similar, but no matter how well you trace the picture it will never be what the original was. Shallow and flat characters and a poorly structured story make 300 only a piece of eye candy.	2.0	300 Is A Spectacular Mess Of A Story Only Glorified By Frank Miller's Amazing Visual Style	2007-03-10	22	10	12

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A34D4KCP94ACJZ	K. Driscoll	"I wanted to look at 300 from a historical perspective.  The story itself is based on the Frank Miller graphic novel of the same name and it stays more true to that than history of course.  In fact, it is a very dedicated adaptation of Frank Miller's work.  After watching 300, in what seemed like a ten minute movie but was almost two full hours, I have to say that I almost prefer this sort of historical fantasy to the historical fiction of Braveheart or Gladiator.  Zack Snyder (the 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake) directs and he, like Miller, is entirely willing to elevate the legendary Greek underdogs who inspired a great people to unite against an unstoppable enemy, to exaggerated mythology. It is a film that doesn't pretend to do anything other than entertain it's audience.  I know a Greek guy who, in an snide imitation of the Pope's rumored reaction to Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, says that 300 ""is as it was.""  Keep that in mind while watching and you will see that 300 is quintessentially about bravado.300, if you don't know already, is about the Battle of Thermopylae, which to be brief basically is a battle that occurs as King Xerxes I's massive Persian army converges toward a small force of Spartans led by King Leonidas.  The Spartans block the only road into Sparta.  The battle is perhaps the most famous last stand in history.300 really is an astounding production.  Considering a budget of $60 million, the film looks amazing even though teetering on over-stylized.  Not to suggest that $60 million is a low budget, but consider for a second the cost of Spiderman 3 ($258 million).This movie is constant primal action and it never stops until almost everyone is dead.  It could've easily followed the formula from other similar movies, and it does at times, but for some reason it's fantasy approach and inclusion of giants, monsters, and super-sized animals puts the movie in such a unique frame that it almost gets away with all of the cliches.  It gives you everything you want in a blood soaked action epic.  All things considered, the acting isn't bad either.  Gerard Butler, who plays Leonidas, is actually very good in his role, while at the same time he carries a presence worthy of his character and all of his men who inevitably die beside him.This is a unique film with a visual style that will make it unforgettable.  The action scenes are intentionally like the comic, so the bloodshed depicted in 300 shouldn't really disturb the audience but it is still pervasive.  Because the film is fantasy, Snyder is justified in liberally interpreting how powerful the Spartans were.  They are basically super-human at times.  The shots often slow down to give the audience the ability to comprehend everything that is happening, reminiscent of the iconic and memorable shots from the Matrix.  Mostly though, this is to show how quickly a Spartan can cut a limb off of a Persian before doing it again and again.  Personally, I have no complaints."	4.0	Amazing Visual Style with Great Action	2007-08-02	8	8	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A23OM1KR4F4RTT	Kelby J. Walker	First off, I think this is one of the greatest films ever made.  These people complaining about the historic facts misrepresented or missing in the film are crazy.  Every movie based on true events and people are always different for entertainment reasons.  From Malcolm X to JFK.  From Braveheart to 300.  I cant speak for everyone, but all these films have made me look deeper into the history of what the film was based off.  Malcolm X made me want to read his book.  JFK made me want to watch documentarys about Kennedy.  American History X and Gladiator made me search the internet.  Braveheart had a pretty good indepth documentary about Wallace history and explain the freedoms they took with his history and why right on the same disc with the movie.  I think for some of those who want the history, 300 will jump start their interest.  I knew the story prior to seeing the movie, but it didnt make the movie wack... nor did the movie destroy or taint the truth.  And lets not forget, 300 is based off Frank Millers comic book.Anyways, with all that to the side... the movie was super creative, visual, and to the point.  The plot did not seem drawn out and it was perfectly filled with action.  I really feel it did what Matrix should've done... set a new standard for that kind of film.  I hope we can expect more creative films like this.  It's always good to see people trying new ways of telling stories.  I think this movies deserves a 5 simply because it is a movie you will watch again and again with family and freinds.	5.0	New Standard	2007-07-19	6	5	1

This is a great movie especially if you enjoy action movies in the style of Gladiator or Lord of the Rings. It has a little bit of medievil feel to it with some fantansy thrown in for good measure. It is a cinematic interpretation of a Frank Miller graphic novel and right now Frank Miller movies are on a roll. First Sin City and now this. If you didn't get a chance to catch this movie in theatres you are in for a real treat. Just be prepared for alot of blood and violence. And the hd dvd version will carry exclusive extras that you will not find on the standard version or the blu-ray version. This is why so many blu-ray fanboys are trying to give this video a bad rating. If this continues I think everyone that prefers hd dvd should begin going to the blu-ray reviews and give all of their high profile movies a bad review. On second thought we probably won't do that since most hd dvd owners have a life. We don't worry about silly stuff like format wars. Hey blu-ray fans go back to your products and stop giving bad reviews of other products just because you're jealous of another format.	5.0	Excellent movie with great extras	2007-07-02	26	20	6

Do not be alarmed by critics, just decide for yourself if you would like to see it or not.  I do not expect people to watch it because I said it was great, but I hope they don't turn away because people seem upset with it.  Everything about it is just so powerful; it is simply a different way to tell a story.  Colorful though dark, everything about it stands out to me even though I have left the theater.  The story is told from the Frank Miller graphic novel and with this approach (Hulk movie tried this with just a sliver) is able to really bring a lot of epic scenes to life.  Regardless of what is happening throughout the film, it is splendid and fun.  The story surrounding the Battle of Thermopylae, where the King of Sparta led his army up against an assault of Persians is quite a story in itself.  Overall a fantastic theater experience and I do not regret attending this film.	5.0	I loved 300, and I want more!	2007-03-10	15	10	5

This is an exciting film with nary a boring nanosecond. This film has style, heroic characters and a gripping narrative. The music, actors, writing and visuals are such so engrossing. Pretty accurate as far as historical details including some lines which were actually spoken, eg. when told the Persian armies arrows would blot out the sun, a Spartan fires back  ""then we will fight in the shade"".

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A26G35WR7QCFR2	Kevbo	"The movie ""300"" is obviously an embellished tale, but it was told so well in this motion picture that it makes for excellent fiction in an historical setting.The best features for me where the perfect coloring and lighting, the action and stunts, the story and plot, and the great acting performances.  And those basically amount to everything that is important in a movie, I gave this flic a 5-star rating.  I just don't think it could have been done better, and I think it is as good as the best films out there right now.To get specific, I will discuss each element noted above.First, the lighting and the colors used in this movie somewhat resemble what we watched in Three Kings, starring George Clooney, et al.  They are so vivid and imaginative.  They bring about a gloomy kind of existence, but a stark portrayal of characters against their ambience.  I found myself thinking, ""those colors are really cool.""  This is just great work.Second, the action and stunts are quite fabulous and should excite anybody who liked The Matrix, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, or similar action movies.  While 300 doesn't quite compare with The Matrix in terms of overall mastery of action sequences, like I said, its scenes should still excite action fans nonetheless.One thing that is obviously glorified in the movie 300 is the bloodbath.  This isn't just about war, violence, or standing up for what someone believes in.  In reality, this movie is about the non-stop provision of bloody, bloody sequences - and not even so much to prove a point, just to provide bloody sequences!  After all, everybody knows ""war is hell,"" and we've all seen war movies where there isn't even any blood!  (Of course, those are out of style now.)  But this war movie is all about blood!  This, of course, accentuates the action sequences and plot.So now, third, the story and plot of 300.  Both are great for the most part, but we see some very minor glitches.  (But they are easily overlooked because of all the blood - ha ha!)The basic story is that the Greek city-state of Sparta is confronted by the entire Persian civilization some thousands of years ago (long before Christ and separated from monotheism - keep these in mind).  Xerxes, the Persian man-god, provokes the pride of Sparta's king by giving him the simple choice: give me what I want or be destroyed.  In great fashion, the Spartan king says ""up yours,"" in so many words.  With integrity, the Spartan king assembles a small military force (allegedly 300 strong) and leads them to fight against tens of thousands of Persian troops and mercenaries.  He does this in the name of Sparta, his family, his beliefs, and for what is altogether good.The plot is simple: grand martyrs championing the cause of free men - think: Alamo... but with a lot of blood and contrasting color schemes!  Or, think of it as the modern day (gory) replacement of the old western.  (Interesting how ancient times have replaced the OK Corral in our movies, isn't it?  Goodbye, Davey Crockett and Sam Houston; hello Leonitus and Maximus.)Simply put, if you love the story about the Alamo (especially the romanticized version of it), then the movie ""300"" is for you, my friend.  And might I add, if you prefer the John Wayne version of the Alamo, then you will DEFINITELY love ""300""!  This movie falls in line with what a conservative's movie library should look like.  (Of course there are exceptions, my liberal friends, but let's face it: left-wingers typically do not appreciate the masculinity in war.)Lastly, on the topic of actors' performances, I have to say that each person rocked it.  For movies like this, you need manly men and womanly women.  Well, you get that here.  Again, it may not be hard left-wingers that appreciate this sort of thing, but I know that there are exceptions.Still, each main character plays a strong role (headstrong, for sure), including the queen.  I would say that this movie vivifies the conservative ideal in nearly all aspects, writing as one.The supporting cast (the soldiers of the 300) are almost exact replicas of their king: brash, manly, unfearing, brave, disciplined, cavalier, and ultimately patriots.  Their banter is so perfect for this kind of movie in that any weakness in manhood would ruin the entire show.  So these characters support the overall plot by exemplifying what it means to be a martyr and fighting for what you believe in.  So, then, each soldier character increases the prestige of the leader, the main character in this story.To close, the movie ""300"" is gory, masculinist, violent, and spectacular.  If you want a modern day Alamo plus gore and graphics, you got it.  Interestingly enough, I think ""300"" tries to relate to American audiences more than any other audience.  You see a lot of American ideals and culture propagated here.  And again, if you are a left-winger, you might have some trouble with the conservative concept of Americanism, such as ""God, family, country,"" which is evident throughout this movie.Again, this is a 5-star movie, and I recommend it for everybody who wants a romanticized tale about manliness.  If you don't appreciate romanticized manliness, you will probably just laugh at guys like me (and this movie's typical audience member).  For those of us who do appreciate a romanticized depiction of what being a man is all about, given in an historical context, I think you will walk away from this movie thinking about it for a long time, as well as finding yourself trying to re-incorporate some aspects of manhood that have slithered away from our culture since the 1970s."	5.0	What It Means To Be Real	2007-08-31	1	1	0

But my uncle said, that's the point, that their world was very tiny.The movie has everyone screaming their heads off when you see it in the thester (we saw it at the IMAX theater here in SF) and that's always something.  I must have missed one scene though.  We know almost from the start that the oracle (or the priests of the oracle) have been bribed by the Persians or by Dominic West to advise Leonidas not to oppose Xerxes' army.  I kept waiting and waiting for those priests to get found out.  Did that ever happen?  If not, will there be a part two, maybe call it ""301"" in which Lena Headey gets revenge on those ghastly old priests, hardly even human, who to satisfy their lust for young girls' flesh, took the money of the oppressor and lied thus completely subverting the sacred relationship of the oracle to man?  And also, we see Leonidas tackling the Oracle Mountain, boulders skittering away under his sandals as he climbs--why do the priests make it so hard to get up there?  How do they bring the virginal young Spartan girls up that mountainside?  Maybe there's a servant's entrance that gets you sent up quickly.It's a movie in which, however, if you don't look great, you're evil.  The hunchback outcast--a traitor.  Those oracle priests--traitors again.  Xerxes--pure evil, even though he does have a kind of decadent beauty a la The Crying Game guy (Jaye Davidson) who played in STARGATE (1994), the obvious referent for this character.Maybe the movie will lead some American boys and girls to join the Armed Services and relieve the ""300"" we have abandoned at our own faraway Thermopylae.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"""300"" is based on a graphic novel by comic ""it"" man, Frank Miller.  Miller based his graphic novel on a series of truly heroic events that happened during the battle of Thermopylae.  Basically what you have here is a true story that sounds as if it is from a comic book getting the comic book treatment.  That's what makes this film so great at times and so mundane at others.  Director Zack Snyder knows how to guide an epic speech, as is done on a number of occasions in this film by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler).  He also knows how to make a battle scene look really cool.  Despite knowing the fate of the Spartans, I cheered them on during their battles with the Immortals and others.  However, much like a number of action and sci-fi yarns of today, Snyder uses visual stylings and CGI effects as a crutch.  Yep, it's cool to watch a man stand down a rhino and even watch a wall of bodies crush a soldier.  However, had Snyder realized just how truly amazing the real story of the Spartans at Thermopylae was, he might have cast off Miller's comic version and gone for the real thing.  In short, the comic bookishness of this movie takes it down a notch.  Don't get me wrong.  I enjoy comic book films as much as anybody.  The problem with this depiction of the Spartans, though, is that the real story is so much better than the comic book version.Seeing this film as nothing more than a comic-to-the-screen adaptation, it works very well.  The action is brutal and swift and, as I stated before, you will pull for the Spartans.  Xerxes (Rodrigo Sanford) gets the larger-than-life treatment, but his god-like voice is sort of funny.  The weapons, the armor, the helmets, and even the animated beasts from Hell all look excellent.If you have no idea as to who or what the Spartans, Xerxes, or the battle at Thermopylae are, you'll really dig this film as a wonder of action and violence.  Heck, even if you do know about the real events and people involved with this story, you'll enjoy this movie as an action yarn.  I highly recommend it to fans of comic book movies.  I also recommend it to history buffs, but the ""razzle-dazzle"" aspect of the film might make it less enjoyable to you."	4.0	Almost An Epic Action Yarn	2007-09-01	1	0	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A22TZUXUKA11SQ	"K. Hinton ""avid reader"""	300 is visually stunning if not completely factually accurate. I think it's unfair to judge movies that are supposed to be solely for entertainment value on the basis of their historical accuracy. 300 isn't claiming to be like Braveheart or Gladiator and instead is based on a graphic novel which is based on historical fact. I think it's too easy to find fault with movies that should be enjoyed solely for their ability to captivate and entertain just because you want to quote history books. If that's the case you won't like this film. But if you want to see some fast-paced action with an incredible story behind it that will keep you interested and entertained from start to finish, 300 will work for you.Also, I should mention that I think this movie might just be the perfect date film.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3JLBAKW0NYIJJ	"K. Holmes ""Movie Fan"""	THe only thing that I really have to say here is to ask the question....How many movies companies are backing Blu-Ray format discs?  How many are backing HD-Dvd?  From the last count, only 1, yes 1, movie studio is making HD-Dvd/reg Dvd discs of their movies, while every other movie studio is making their available in regular Dvd and Blu-Ray only.  HBO was also backing HD-Dvd, but even now they have jumped on the Blu-Ray band wagon over the less quality HD-Dvd.  THat right there should tell you who the clear cut winner is going to be in the next few years until someone develops something even better to try and take their places like it seems to happen ever decade or so.  I am not personally saying that Blu-Ray is better than HD-Dvd, since I have never seen a movie in HD-Dvd, but I do tend to trust the thinking of major movie companies and as far as I can tell, they are pretty much telling everyone that Blu-Ray is the way to go since Blu-Ray is what they are all backing over Hd-Dvd.  Take what you want out of this information, but if you want to be able to have the largest home movie selection in the future go for Blu-Ray since you know you can;t have a very large good home movie selection in HD-Dvd if you can only get and watch movies from only one movie studio and only have access to the movies that they make and no one else.	5.0	Blu-ray All The Way....	2007-07-26	15	7	8

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AGKJF15QQNVX6	"klownboy ""klownboy"""	"There are times in film (few) where you are just overwhelmed with the spectacle of it all.  The merger of vision, story, and technology that can immerse you in a world, or a moment, or an emotion.  Like the Star Destroyer fly-by in the opening of Star Wars, the first time you see the T-1000 morph, even the train-station-to-waltz sequence in the Fisher King.  All of those moments take you someplace else, and impress the circumstance and emotion on the viewer at a deeper level.  300 is notable, if for nothing else, for stringing more of these moments together in a more timeless manner than in any other movie I have ever seen.Fully embracing Frank Miller's graphic novelization of the tale, 300 comes to the screen in muted brown grey swirls, punctured by color only when necessary.  A presentation that will likely stand the test of time as opposed to the some of the special effects sequences mentioned above.  300 foregoes rote historical exposition, and instead unfolds in a series of surreal canvasses.  It's as if we stumbled on to a long lost collection of paintings chronicling the events of the myth.  We're immersed in the mastery of the craftsmanship, and awed by the vision; yet understandably unconcerned if the outfits aren't exactly the right color.  And this works because 300 isn't about the ""history"", 300 is a celebration, a dreamlike amplification of the legend.The blue screen soundstage shooting gives the performances the closeness of a stage production, but also adds the ability to paint anything, anywhere, at anytime.  A significant improvement over other recent attempts at the technique.  As a result, you are always where you need to be, always at the right vantage point to fully enjoy the story. This contrbutes greatly to how incredibly well paced the story is, maintaining its energy and message throughout its length.  300 even takes the extra step to find the right ending point for the movie, not just wrapping it up with some weepy terse pablum at the battlesite, but illustrating what outcome the sacrifice of the 300+ really created for Sparta, for Greece, for democracy, and ultimately for all of us.  The buildup, the battle, the intrigue, the defeat, and the ultimate victory all laid out masterfully, rollickingly, and enjoyably.One of the more amusing jabs from the negative critics was the knock on the dialogue - even when many of the cited offending lines are taken from the only available historical sources.  I'll leave the politics to the side by just saying history does repeat itself, and any take on history has lessons to teach.  I can't speak to Mr. Miller's politics, but his rendition of the tale (and the actual history) has many parallels to the present, and can be interpreted as pointing a damning finger at many in today's world.  (And hey, if the Iranian government is against it on ""cultural"" grounds, then sign me up!)It is hard to find a single battle with a greater impact on the development and spread of democracy then the real battle of Thermopylae.  You can learn more about that history in any number of places, and I'd encourage you to do so.  But it's impossible to find a more impressive, awe-inducing telling of the myth than 300."	5.0	"Just ""Wow"""	2007-07-30	5	5	0

There is so much CG that the whole thing really does have more the look of a drawing than a photo.The thing the viewer needs to understand that this story is being told by the narrator, Dilios, and that much of it is obviously embellished or exaggerated.  Knowing that gives one the perspective to value the story and the visuals for what they are. I have never seen the book.I hoped that the second disc would have more interesting features.  The most interesting ones were too short to give detail.  It would have been nice if they had included a bit more of the real (known) history of the battle and the circumstances surrounding it.

This film was literally like watching a painting. The blood splatter was breathtaking. The limbs flying seemed to have a grace of their own. It was brutally beautiful with gorgeous gore. Enough cannot be said for this film while at the same time this reviewer is at a loss for words!There are a few twists and tweaks of  historical truths ( ex. the fighting style and Phalanx), but overall the movie stays fairly close to the reality. Even the scholar Herodotus took great liberties in explaining the history of the ancient world, such as suggesting that Leonidas fought against 2 million, while archaeologists agree it was probably more like 200,000. This does not diminish the film which was clearly not produced as a historically accurate account but as a sword swinging, bare-chested celebration of abs and flying body parts.For those of you not familiar with ancient Greek history, here is a quick synopsis of the legend of King Leonidas. Leonidas was the 17th in the Agiad line, a procession of rulers believed to have been direct descendants of Heracles.  Refusing to bow under the pressure of Persian oppression, Leonidas set out against their ruler, Xerxes, with only 300 Spartan troops. He and his valiant men were able to hold back the Persian invasion for two days in what is referred to as the Battle of Thermopylae.There are a few lines in the movie which are taken directly from historic texts. For example, when Xerxes demands that the Spartans drop their weapons, Leonidas was heard to reply, ""Come and get them!"". On the third morning and what would be the final day of battle, the king told his men to eat hearty for they would be dining in Hades that night.Ephialtes, a Thessalian man, apparently betrayed the King by showing the Persians an alternative route to attack the Spartans from behind. There were two Spartans who escaped death at Thermopylae on the third day of battle. One in particular, Aristodemos, suffered an eye injury and was taken back to Sparta. He would later return and fight at the Battle of Plataea which would force the Persians to give up any further invasions into Greece.The actors were outstanding considering they worked with a blue or green screen behind 100 percent of the time. King Leonidas is portrayed by Gerard Butler, an actor with a voice so powerful that everyone in the theater should be convinced to join him in battle. The gorgeous Lena Headey plays Queen Gorgo with style and throws down two of the best lines in the movie. Backing up our heroes is an efficient cast of actors such as Dominic West, David Wenham and Rodrigo Santoro.This is the classic story of the little guy versus the known world with a clear message that freedom must be earned - sometimes in bloody, decapitated fashion."	5.0	If you missed this movie in the theaters, we all feel sorry for you.	2007-12-19	2	2	0

I marvel at the strength of the Spartan queen as well as the loyal warriors who march with Leonidas and die with him.  There are also, as in every culture, those who engage in politics and deceit--even in Sparta.This movie has a powerful, oppressive empire (the Persians) and an underdog.  It has those with honor and those with none.  This is a movie for fans of history and of action movies, but is not for general family viewing.  There is one steamy scene with the King and his Queen, as well as plenty of bloody battle action.	4.0	History and Action	2013-07-19	0	0	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AZ78HT7H9DVJG	LARRY	In *300*, Dilios narrates the life of Leonidas, king of Sparta, especially bringing our attention to the battle at Thermophylae.  Immediately after birth, Spartan males are inspected for flaws.  If flawed, they are tossed out and killed.  If normal, they are trained at a young age as a warrior.  There's no greater honor than to die for Sparta.When Leonidas becomes king, there's a threat looming Sparta.  Xerxes, the god-king, of Persia declares that all must bow before him or face consequences.  Sparta does not escape Xerxes' eyes.  Bound by tradition, Leonidas heads up high to a rocky mountain to consult with a monestary and the Oracle to get her blessing.  The Oracle warns that they should not go to war to honor an upcoming sacred festival.Ignorning the Oracle's warning, Leonidas rounds up 300 Spartan men and leads them to Thermophylae to battle Xerxes and his men.  Meanwhile, the Spartan Queen has discovered that there's a traitor in Leonidas' army.  She pleads to the Senate to send additional armies to stop this traitor.What can I say?  Beautiful cinematic styles and shots.  The costumes and the fight scenes were mesmerizing.  The arrival of Xerxes as the god-king was just mind-blowing.  The wall of corpses was just creepy.The movie itself can be a bit long for some viewers.  However, if you enjoy history (although some reviewers have stated that there are some errors), war and dialogues in ancient times, then you'll enjoy this.	5.0	"a ""David & Goliath"" movie...and a good one!"	2007-09-27	2	0	2
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ASSCA9IS0GWF5	Laszlo Matyas	Political, racial, and historical implications aside, I love 300. It's one vicious rip-roaring firestorm facecrusher of an action movie. It's raw and wild and exciting and heroic, and at times it feels absolutely epic. The story- lifted from Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name- is a gloriously violent retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae (in which 300 Spartans held of a gargantuan army of invading Persians for three days) actually sorta threatened to push me away from the movie (not a big historical fiction fan). But that was before I saw the action scenes. They're incredible in every sense of the word, dripping with tension and violence and anger and testosterone and blood. Watching those godlike Spartans threaten to lay waste to their ridiculously well-staffed opponents is a visceral rush, and the movie's intensity only gets stronger as the story wears on. And then there are the visuals, which are raw and dream-like and dripping with dark color. We've also got larger-than-life characters, villains that are fun to hate, heroes that are fun to root for, and a climax that'll melt your skin off. Wicked, wicked cool.	5.0	This...

This is the type of movie that both male and female can enjoy.  It's just pure fun to watch and you cannot help but get into the characters and story.  It is very riveting and intense and the battle seens are outstanding.  The soldiers work together in the movie and perform like a well oiled machine and it's amazing to watch!  Even though it has some bloody parts, it's not the disturbing sick type of gore for the sake of gore.  Very classy!!  Gerard (Gerry) Butler is outstanding in this role and really gives a strong depth to King Leonidas that no one else could have pulled off.  All of the cast were outstanding!!  I have not been this thrilled with a movie for a long, long time and I am an average single working mother.  Definitely not just a ""guy"" movie.

The reviewer who refers to pixels blinking in the background is pretty spot on. About 1/3rd of this reveals the gorgeous color palette in HD that you would expect and the rest of the movie on the disc can be disconcerting by comparison.Just an FYI to folks who are looking to upgrade from the regular DVD, you may be disappointed.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"Before going to see ""300"" this afternoon I watched the 1962 film""The 300 Spartans.""I have a strong affection for the marching music in the film and the shot of Leonidas leading the Spartan phalanx for the last time, plus an enduring sense of injustice at the Persians dispatching the last Spartans by wave after wave of cartoon arrows.  I had read Frank Miller's""300""when it was first published in five issues so I knew what to expect.  This film is not history: it is art.  Granted, we are talking post-modern art, but that still counts as art in a world where computers are as important as cameras when making a movie.The Battle of Thermopylae was fought in 480 B.C.  The Persian army of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) is invading Greece with the largest army the world has ever seen.  With the Spartan army prohibited from marching north because of a religious festival, King Leonidas (Gerald Butler in fine form) heads for the natural bottleneck on the main road between Locris and Thessaly with the 300 men of his bodyguard.  After three days of battle the Spartans were betrayed by a man named Ephialtes who showed the Persians a mountain path that led behind the Greek lines.  While the rest of the Greek soldiers retreated, the 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians were slaughtered to the last man.  Simonides composed a famous epigram that was engraved as an epitaph on a commemorative stone placed on top of the burial mound of the Spartans at Thermopylae: ""Go, stranger, and tell the Spartans, That we lie here in obedience to their laws.""Miller was inspired by historical events but was not constrained by it in telling his story.  In his version Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan) is no longer a poor shepherd but a deformed figure who was born to parents who fled Sparta rather than leave their infant on a rock to die, adding elements of pathos and irony hitherto unseen with regards to the character.  Nor is this movie the attempt to faithfully bring Miller's art to life that we saw with ""Sin City,"" which is perfectly fine with me.  Besides, director Zack Snyder's film reminded me more of lots of other films, from ""Gladiator"" to ""Hero,"" more than it did ""Sin City.""  I want to say that what we saw of this type of modern filmmaking in ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" has been refined, but that would be quite an ironic comment to make about such a gory and gritty film.  Ultimately, the movie is rather impressionistic in nature, emphasizing graphic images over everything else, which brings us back around again to the idea that ""300"" is art and not history.I was quite pleased the overall ""300"" met my expectations.  During the first part of the battle Snyder (""Dawn of the Dead"") resorts to the rapid series of cuts that I have come to deplore in contemporary action films because I can never tell what is happening.  I understand that a battle is a sea of chaos, but if I cannot tell what is going on I become distracted.  I want to see what is happening in order for the scenes to become memorable to me.  Fortunately the rest of the movie takes full advantage of slow motion technique we see in the trailers and television spots for the film.  In fact, ""300"" makes better use of slow motion than any film I can remember, mainly because the point is not to prolong the suspense (e.g., the end of the fight in ""Rocky II""), but to let you see what is happening (e.g., River's fight scenes in ""Serenity"").  Think of watching big hits in football in slow motion replay and you get a sense of how Snyder is able to strategically slow down the action to see not only the power but also the grace of the violence.Looks are everything in this film, so the Spartans fight bare-chested, the better for their muscles to ripple, while the Persians might be the most overdressed warriors in cinematic history (although I admit that I have to wonder where the Spartans were hiding their helmets on the long trip from Sparta to the Hot Gates).  ""300"" is a film that glories in visual excess as the army of Xerxes becomes a computer generated million man march and the pass at Thermopylae exists between towering pillars of rock.  This may or may not be the most computer generated figures on the screen at one time in the history of the world, but I have to believe ""300"" offers the biggest piles of corpses we have ever seen.  As if quantity was not enough to overwhelm the Spartans, Leonidas and his men are confronted by a towering Xerxes and a host of monstrous men and animals.  The net result may well be the best comic book movie to date, despite the fact the hero is a historical figure and not a superhero.This adaptation plays up a subplot regarding what is happening back at Sparta while Leonidas and his body guard face annihilation as Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to play politics with Theron (Dominic West), who complains about the legitimacy of the king's actions rather than deal with the reality of a Persian army coming to crush Greece.  But it is hard to care about such machinations in the face of the historical record and the fact that the drama is happening at Thermopylae and not back in Sparta.  There are notes sounded about saving Greece from the Persians and civilization from the evils of Asian mysticism, but the legacy of the Spartans has nothing to do with their role in the development of democracy.  Almost two millennium before the Alamo there was this story of a group of warriors that sacrifice their lives in a battle so that their people could win the war.  The story of the 300 Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae is that of the first great last stand."	5.0	Frank Miller's take on the first great last stand finally arrives on the big screen	2007-03-09	65	52	13
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1L43KWWR05PCS	Lawyeraau	"This film recreates the events that led up to the battle at Thermopylae, the battle itself, and its aftermath. It tells the story of how King Leonidas of Sparta  with 300 of Sparta's best trained warriors fought a battle to the death, fending of a horde of thousands of soldiers lead by the Persian King Xerxes, who was intent on conquering all the Greeks, literally heading them off at the pass at Thermopylae. Greece, at the time of the battle, was not a single entity but, rather, a compilation of city states. Spartans were known for their highly developed physical attributes and their well trained phalanx of fighting men. The Athenians, on the other hand, tended to be the scholars and philosophers.The general story is well told, and the cast is superlative, giving excellent performances. Special kudos go to Gerald Butler for his portrayal of King Leonidas, a man for whom duty and honor is everything. Also noteworthy is the beautifully nuanced performance of Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo, wife to King Leonidas. In her hands,  the queen comes alive as a vibrant, intelligent, helpmate to the king, unafraid of voicing her opinion and capable of doing what is necessary to ensure that the King is well-served. Lest anyone think that contemporary norms are what drive her portrayal, one need know that Spartan woman held a position of respect in their culture.What I found distracting about the film were the special effects, as it had a somewhat jarring effect. At times, I felt as if I were watching one of my son's video games, as that is what it resembled, especially during the battle scenes. It was somewhat cartoonish and, I felt, diminished the film. Of course, the film is based upon the graphic novel, ""300"", by Frank Miller, which is pretty much a hardcover comic book, and it appears that the director of the film stayed to true to the source of his inspiration.The battle at Thermopylae, however, is one of history's great stories, and it is a shame that it had to be reduced to something simulating an arcade experience. I venture to say, however, that that is one of the attributes of the film that others may really enjoy. It is simply a matter of different strokes for different folks, and viewers will probably divide on this issue along generational lines. No matter which side of the divide in which one may find oneself, one will, undoubtedly, enjoy this well-acted film. I know that I did."	4.0	THE BATTLE AT THERMOPYLAE...	2007-08-25	1	0	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2A872FUPBWG46	"lee freke ""journalist"""	"""300"" is a movie based on the legendary exploits of Spartan King Leonidas and Persian King Xerxes.Xerxes organized a Million Man March and then threatened the Greek states with plunder and subjugation; only Leonidas and his 300 guards stood inthe way of Spartan annihilation.This is not the first adaptation of this tale to the screen. Forty five years ago, David Egan and Ralph Richardson acted in the forgettable ""300 Spartans.""""300"" is a new adaptation directed by Zack Snyder and based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller.There are multiple ways to view 300. It could be taken a promotional video for the US Army or as an ad campaign for Bowflex. The reviewer prefers to see it as a plain action flick.Without doubt, this is one of the more beautiful films that have graced the screen.The subdued hues, the period costumes (or the lack of it) and ragged terrain are lovely to behold. When the Spartans observe the Persians fleet swallowed in the tumult, as the rain glides on Leonidas's shield, the shot resembles a painting worthy of the Louvre.The battle scenes and phalanx were choreographed with attention to detail. And then there was the gore. What wondrous fountains of gushing red fluid, what perverse amputations and beheadings.Despite the critical consensus, 300 is terribly flawed.Snyder has gotten a pass for reworking Miller's novel onscreen. However, 10 minutes into the movie, the question has to be asked: Why did Leonidas need to go to war? And if he did, why take only 300 men? Some excuses were alluded to, but these were rendered in lackluster fashion as to be made inconsequential to the plot.Moreover, the pacing was off. Initially, the back story was rushed to make way for the blood-soaked spectacle. Then we were assaulted with barrage upon barrage of Persian suicide fighters.Following the first contact between the armies, each battle scene became a more brazen attempt to intoxicate the audience with slow motion and quick editing.By the end, the experience was underwhelming. There was no climax.300 is visually appealing, but not much more. Without a coherent plot or the tiniest bit of social commentary, it is an imperfect, albeit enjoyable film by a talented director whose best days are ahead of him."	3.0	All Abs, No Muscle.	2008-03-03	4	1	3

This movie, besides its ovbious fictoral representation, portrays the spartan life style in good detail and engages the viewer in a world of fearless warriors who fealt pain as being the journey to the road that leads to glorious death in battle.  The battle of thermoplae is considered to be the single greatest military feat in history, a band of 300 spartans held off a persian army of 200,000 men in a 3 day long battle that will live on in the minds of war enthuists for years to come.  With the odds stacked at over 600 persians to every spartan, this would seem as a battle that should not have lasted longer than a minute, imagine fighting off 600 people for 3 days by yourself, this should give you an idea of just how extraudinary the spartan defence reallly was.  I love this movie because it captures the attitude i always imagined a spartan warrior would have, cocky, determined, and above all, a little crazy.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A31OD7WTXRNYG5	"Leonidas ""Lakonian"""	Another ridiculous movie based on a comic book. What a colossal waste of money and talent; and to think that a movie version of Stephen Pressfield's stunningly excellent book, Gates of Fire, could have been made instead of this rubbish.Historical accuracy??? Where to begin. First of all, at the beginning of each year the Spartan council passed a law that all Spartan men shave their mustaches. In this atrocity almost all men had full beards, including mustaches. The movie accurately describes the Spartans as being unbelievably well trained to hold a line and move as one (protecting the man to the left with shield) and then shows most battle scenes as individual combat. Even at the end (Battle of Plataea) it shows the 10,000 Spartans running pell-mell into battle. No, no, NO! The terror the Spartan army instilled in their enemies was that they came on slowly in perfect step, inexorably, to the accompaniment of flute music. If they ran, it was only the last few steps, to slam into the ranks of the enemy. At Thermopylae, they held the Persians for 2 days+ precisely because they presented them with an unbroken wall of bronze shields bristling with 8 foot spears held OVERHAND (not underhand as in this movie). The Persians didn't have elephants there, nor rhinoceroses, nor were they stupid enough to charge a line of spearmen with cavalry. The Persians were a handsome people, not ugly as depicted here. Xerxes didn't look like a bling-bedecked, hip-hop pimp (like George W he wanted to finish what his daddy started at Marathon); the Persian Immortals didn't wear chrome plated masks nor have hand grenades. I could go on and on.

Unlike the Alamo, Custer's Last Stand and many other glorious battles where the parties involved did not expect to be wiped out, the Spartans willingly held their positions knowing that they could not possibly win against such overwhelming odds.Gerard Butler (!), Lena Headey (who is GORGEOUS!), Vincent Regan, David Wenham (Faramir from LOR), and the rest of this exceptional cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!

There is much to learn in this tightly-woven, well-written, and powerfully-acted historical drama that says in simplest form, ""In order to continue to be free, we must stand against the odds and continue to fight for that freedom.""In choosing Gerard Butler for this lead role, the producers added much to the statement. A more ""in-crowd"" actor would have diminished the idea of going against the odds and staying true to who you are in spite of opposing opinions and the social hype of ""should be."" Butler epitomizes the stance of standing outside the crowd and succeeding there, and anyone who has seen his interviews knows the role is both ""him"" and enough unlike him to be an honest acting role. They didn't fit the part to the actor (such as Affleck and company playing themselves in different roles). They picked an actor with the talent to both fit the part and to make it his own.Along with the skill of the actors involved, the artistry of the movie is something rarely seen in mainstream cinema today. It was exceptionally filmed, dramatic and scenic and vivid without an excess of gore, and with enough humor to bring occasional relief from the drama.There are many lessons in this film. Let's hope they will be captured and taken away after the credits roll."	5.0	Artistic History at its Finest	2007-08-02	4	3	1

Miller is talented and leans toward the dark side. Look at his GN Sin City, and his crown jewel The Dark Knight Returns.  The film 300 is imbued with a certain magic that stems from the excellent directing and cinematography.  This movie must win Oscars because it has recreated ancient Sparta in a way that makes it seem at once alive and at once from another dimension.The other-worldiness stems from the nature of the soldiers from all over the world that have joined Persian King Xerxes.  They ride massive beasts, or wear ancient masks.  And Xerxes himself is the icing on the cake, an androgynous man with many piercings and an impossibly deep voice.  What a great villian!  He is so charismatic, his army so overwhelming, that you actually find yourself wanting to just give up and join him.But here we have our 300.  300 ultra-brave, ultra-buff, ultra-strong heroes upon whom rests a literally impossible task.

This helped me to really enjoy the experience. For you see this is NOT a movie to watch, but a movie to LOOK at.  To look at like you would look at works of art.  The color is the first thing that catches the eye. The different shades of brown seem to turn the actors into paintings.  You find yourself noticing the curve of a mussle or the shape of a [...].  The lack of red as in blood is not missed.  The battle scenes take on artistic beauty and you look for the details around the edges of the frame.  The gore of battle is a strange thing here.  The beheading is not horrible, but for some strange and weird reason you watch it noting the slow spraying of the blood and collapse of the head. And it is not upsetting nor grizzly but a work of art.  The dance by the woman is beautiful and it takes you time to notice that she is nude. Is it sexy or porn? No it is flowing and artful.There is one strange thing that happens after you have seen the movie.

Overall, i think this film is a little overrated to a degree.  I did enjoy it though, especially(or mainly because of) the action, stunning visuals, and cinematography.  The look of the film is worth a rental alone.  It is extremely violent, but the cgi negates some of that as it makes the brutality seem less...well, brutal.  I didn't like the look of some of the villains, but since it's based on a graphic novel and cgi-heavy i'll give that a pass.The real testament as to whether the film is good or not to me though is not the efx or action, but rather or not if i liked/cared about/rooted for/identified with the characters or not.  The answer would be yes.  They aren't deep characterizations obviously, and the ""few fighting bravely against great odds"" theme usually wins me over anyway.  Nevertheless, the movie did make me care about these 300 and i did want them to make it despite me knowing their fate well in advance.So, i would recommend this as a definite watch.  But i'm not in the ""it's the greatest thing since sliced bread"" camp either(which is why i bought the cheaper no-frills, sorry, i meant single-disc edition).  Honestly, i would love to see The Matrix and the 300 fans battle it out in a Destroy All Hype contest.  Btw, another credit i'll give to the movie is it peaked my interest even more into the subject matter to the point i ordered the 60's(?) The 300 Spartans(saw a little on tv once, kinda liked it), and the History Channel's Last Stand of the 300 documentary to go along with this.  Might make for a good triple-bill.  Ironically, it didn't make me want to buy or read the graphic novel it was based on(i guess because i just saw it on-screen).  Anyway, can't wait for the sequel  302: Electric Boogaloo.  You know what i'm talkin' about.  (note: if i get 10 unhelpful votes, i'll edit out that last 'joke')"	4.0	THIS.  IS.  SPARTA!!!	2007-08-01	13	10	3

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1TWTULVD6F22O	"L. Quido ""quidrock"""	"I came to this movie, ""300"", more as a student of Greek history and a lover of dramatic visual statements, and not a fan of graphic novels, or graphic comics. It doesn't really matter how you approach it. For me, the film ""300"" might be the most amazing theater experience I'll have this year. The release of the two-disc special DVD (there is also a single disc version), laden with special effects (including several short features about the history and the production itself) promises to bring a sell-out crowd despite the early list price of $34.99.Somewhat loosely based on the ancient battle between Greeks (yes, more city-states from Greece than just Sparta were involved) and the world-conquering forces of King Xerxes of Persia in 480 BC, the Battle of Thermopylae, is played out in the mind and art of Frank Miller, whose successful graphic novel spawned the film. Miller's had a lot of success, notably with ""Sin City"", and the films made from his books are faithful to the original material and feature over the top special effects, CGI, and an artist's eye to the total, sumptuous visual landscape.As Xerxes pulled out all the stops to conquer the world in the 5th century, it was troubling to him that his father, Persian King Darius, had been defeated in his efforts to move westward by the Athenians in the Battle of Marathon. Xerxes had put down rebellions in Babylon and Egypt, and made careful preparation to conquer Greece; he dug a channel, built bridges, laid in provisions and honed the warrior skills of a force purported to be 50,000-70,000 (the million man army in the film). He bribed and won over several of the Greek city states to his cause. His messengers set out to do the same with the King of Sparta, Leonidas (Gerard Butler, a Scot who was Wes Craven's ""Dracula"", the incredibly sexy Andre Marek of ""Timeline"", and the film Phantom for Andrew Lloyd Webber).""300"" begins at the childhood of Leonidas, to set the stage for the warrior mentality of the Spartans. The early scenes depict how the Spartans might kill any baby who had any type of weakness or deformity at birth. Based on the decisions of the Elders, the ""weak"" were left to die at the ravages of the environment on Mount Taygetos. It shows how, at the age of 7, the boys are taken from their homes and raised in packs, taught to be warriors with savagery and brutality inflicted on their spirits.When the Persians come calling, Leonidas defies them, against the advice of the local Oracle, and the Greek council, who forbid him to go to war. Leonidas, counseled by his wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey..from ""The Brothers Grimm""..here she is a queen to be reckoned with)sets off with a ""bodyguard"" of 300 men to deflect the Persian attack. It is a doomed effort, but one in which the Persian army is severely shamed and its forces reduced by thousands of dead.In the end, a Greek traitor shares a secret passage with the Persians, that allows the small force of Spartans to be defeated, even as Queen Gorgo is pleading with the city council (controlled by the evil Theron ...Dominic West) to release more forces. It is inconceivable that the Greeks waited to come to the aid of a King who was fighting for the very freedom that was held so dear by all Greeks.There are crucial characterizations here, between King and Queen, whose bond and caring for their own small son, is made secondary to their pride in being Spartans. You will believe in them. There are love scenes (and some gratuitous female nudity early on in the film) that help advance that feeling between them.There is the relationship between Leonidas and his men, the pride, the harsh training evident in their ability to act as one in battle. (And yes, there is the most amazing display of male 6-pack abs ever displayed on film). There is the grittiness in the feel and the dirt of the life of a soldier. There is the evil that seeps from the lavish world of King Xerxes (whose character was absent from the early advertising and trailers of this film, resulting in a huge surprise when he first appears on the screen); he gives new meaning to the term larger-than life. Xerxes is played by Rodrigo Santoro, also appearing on the small screen as Paulo in ""Lost"".There is the raw use of CGI in depicting the creatures and zombies used in the fighting forces of Xerxes, as well as in the hunchbacked traitor Ephialtes. This is pretty typical for the graphic novel culture, and it will be one of the largest areas of criticism of the film. For me, these special effects and unrealistic creatures contributed to the battles in the same way they did in the Lord of the Rings series.And really, its all about the battle. The manner in which ""300"" is filmed is somewhat like that of a video game....you, the watcher, are transported to the battle. Its sounds, horrors and the ravages of countless death upon death surround you. Blood spatters everywhere. The Spartans are fighting machines, coupling their efforts with a terrain, strategy and technique that Leonidas sketched out with the Oracle, enacted in his battle with the wolf, and brought to life with his forces as they defeat wave after wave of bloodthirsty soldiers that Xerxes sends against them. His Captain, (Welsh actor Vincent Regan) is engaged both in battle and in pride for his young son, who fights by his side - the Captain's anguish at the loss of his son is real and tragic. Wounding by both sword and spear is depicted, as is decapitation and the terror of the victor cleaning up the field of battle by killing the wounded. The hordes of the Persian army are of epic proportion.The battle scenes, yes, the entire film is stylistically colored in sepia and earth tones, and the violence fills up every frame. The cinematography here, and even in the quiet parts of the film, is amazing.The ""300"" is one man's vision of a historical event, magnified by today's technology, and assembled for the screen to depict how important it is to fight for freedom, even if you do so at the cost of your own life. It has been said to be a ""man's film"" but that is true only if you discount the underlying philosophy and bravery of what it takes to stand for something, and how even the love between two people, between a group of men fighting for a just cause may temporarily be defeated, but ultimately vindicated when lives are lost to sacrifice for the greater good.And I can't wait to buy the DVD!!!"	5.0	Anticipating a wild demand for the DVD....	2007-07-22	17	14	3

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2ULSA0IRUE09E	Marc Cabir Davis	"I'm a fan of graphic novel adaptations as much as the next person, but ""300"" was a really bad movie.Yes, the effects were nice and its interesting to see what digital wizardry and a blue-screen can do.However, there is simply no story (even if this story is true, its pretty boring, and very dubious), and to top it all, everyone is acting ferocious and enthusiastic about war, and its not really very convincing.The Spartans even have a ridiculous battle cry that sounds like wounded wolves. This is not a good thing.This was more of a comedy - I almost fell off my chair when they brought the 8 foot tall Persian King Xerxes in. He played the role so over the top and so flamboyant, I was giggling throughout.And what was up with the boring angle of the Kings' wife sleeping around and then killing her traitor. A useless sub-plot to be sure.Some of the digital animals used were fun to watch - such as the gigantic rhino and the useless elephants (they all trip over a cliff and fall - Im being serious).Then there is the question of the insanely ripped abs on all the Spartans (who I'm guessing were all gay anyway - does history prove me wrong?) - and they all seem to be incredibly into each other - a little too much.The only one into the war seems to be the King, and he dies this really poorly filmed death, so whats the point.This was a two hour ""Braveheart"" rip-off, and they don't even win the war!Jokes aside, this was pretty terrible, with some nonsensical violence, and oh, of course, a Middle-Eastern sounding background score so that Western audiences can go ""Oooh, how authentic"". Please.This was nonsense. Its amazing that such shoddy garbage is being revered as 'art'. Fanboys need some new material, or they need to actually travel the world and get out more to appreciate true art.Two stars.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2X9AXCWH4MT4I	"Marcy G. ""MarcyG"""	"I take offense to critics and reviewers who dismiss ""300"" as a mere 'film for guys and fanboys.' I am neither a guy nor a fanboy.  As a history and movie buff, I had been anticipating this movie since I heard that it was being made early last year, and took even more interest in it when I heard of the cast.  I knew it was a movie I wanted to see and so this weekend, I invited five of my female friends to see it for a girls afternoon out and I am pleased to report that we all enjoyed it thoroughly.""300"" is a visual masterpiece with amazing battle sequences, an engrossing story and well drawn characters.  Most 'action' type movies come off with clunky dialogue and a poor storyline but Zack Snyder does an impressive job of casting little known (excepting Gerard Butler) but well respected British actors and filming almost completely on blue screen without sacrificing the storyline or losing its historical significance.  While other CGI-driven films come off as unconvincing and some laughably fake, ""300"" comes off as a visually stunning and eye-popping masterpiece.  This is a film that successfully blends art and action. In many ways, Zach Snyder is a visionary filmmaker and a worthy successor to the likes of Peter Jackson and George Lucas.Another strength is in the story.  It is tightly woven and starts off with a background to the Spartan warrior code and how spartan boys are trained for combat at a very early age.  It then fast forwards to  the 'present' as messengers for King Xerxes of Persia visit King Leonidas of Sparta and order him to submit or die.  Leonidas then takes 300 of his best men to the 'hot gates' of Thermopylae to cut off the approaching Persian army.  What takes place is one of the most famous battles in history as the Spartans (and other Greeks) take on Xerxes' army of thousands (some even say millions), and their sacrifice paves the way for the unification of Greece as a nation.I will not pretend that everything in this film is historically accurate but I was actually surprised that it came pretty close.  This is not the History Channel.  If you want an accurate depiction of the Battle of Thermopylae then there are documentaries for that available.  This is an adaptation of the graphic novel by Frank Miller, who depicts the Battle of Thermopylae in his book of the same name.  There are some changes, but they lend to the story and are completely plausible.The casting is topnotch as well, eventhough they are not A-list names.  Gerard Butler (King Leonidas) carries the film but there are also standout performances from Lena Heady (Queen Gorgo), David Wenham (Dilios - and Faramir from 'The Lord of the Rings'), Michael Fassbender (Stelios - and Azazeal from the tv drama ""Hex""), Dominic West (Theron), Vincent Regan (Captain) and newcomer Tom Wisdom (Astinos).  The actors who play Spartan warriors look the part - all tall, muscular and powerful.  The only character I didn't warm to was Rodrigo Santoro's Xerxes who came off as over the top (though this was done on purpose).The action scenes are fast and furious, and there is a great deal of blood and violence. The interesting thing about this is that it doesn't come off as gory.  I mean, it's no worse than R-rated films like ""Gladiator"" or ""Troy"" and I've seen scary movies that are far worse. The fight scenes are full of energy, with a mix of slow-motion and fast, battering-ram-like power, as the Spartans thrust their spears and swords at the enemy.  I have not seen powerful battle scenes like this since the 'Ride of the Rohirrim' sequence in ""The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King"" and it is absolutely thrilling.  When the barrage of arrows from the Persians block out the sun and the Spartans push the Persians to their death at sea, it is both beautiful and awe-inspiring.In summary, ""300"" is a movie that a wide range of audiences can enjoy.  History buffs will enjoy it because it is a fair and (for the most part) accurate depiction of the Battle of Thermopylae.  Fanboys and comic book fans will enjoy it because of its Frank Miller roots and Zach Snyder's vision.  And most everyone else will enjoy it because it is an entertaining, engrossing film. ""300"" is a movie I plan to see again and again, and I trust it will be a part of my collection when it comes out on DVD."	5.0	A visual treat with an engrossing story...	2007-03-11	13	8	5

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A139ZF7CJVVTJU	"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only"""	"Hold ""300"" up to the light and you can see right through it's glorious, silk-screened surface to the empty glow behind.  Ostensibly ""about"" a group of Spartans who dare to be the only true force of resistance against a mind-bogglingly huge Persian army, this film is really only about the harsh, sandy images that make up each of its flickering seconds.Why fret about political imperatives?  The only ""message"" you'll find here is the one you send up from your own mind to float along with the projector's high-beam.  Why read into its bloody contours and mythic dialogue notes of racism and homophobia?  The only prejudices that wink back from the characters are the ones you feel ready to expect.  ""300"" is, indeed, a beautifully rendered film, but much like the planes of the most gorgeous mirror, the only substance you will find to look at is the reflection of your own ideologies and assumptions.Okay, so I'm waxing prosaic on a movie that already has enough lush pastoral glitter.  It's hard to do much more, though.  This film is ""about"" the Battle of Thermopylae, and its plot boasts battle twists, betrayal, political intrigue, corruption, and self-sacrifice, but these elements are hasty and almost derivative when you compare them to the astonishing visuals they are meant to impel.After all, we're talking about a group of men who -- for some reason -- feel compelled to fight in fat, red robes, shin guards, helmets, and leather thongs.  And that's it.  Their odd battle accoutrements are the REAL icons of their bravery.  (Of course, if they'd opted for breastplates, we wouldn't be treated to the vales of scultped pecs and abs these actors worked so hard to build.)  It's just one more hint that what this is about is not why these men fight, but that they fight at all, and look good doing it.And, don't be confused, the movie looks good.  Hell, it looks fantastic.  Every panel of Miller's graphic novel (don't you dare call it a comic book) is exquisitely and excruciatingly rendered in detail so fine that you can feel it slipping like splinters into each rod and cone of your retina.  I was, in fact, tempted to give it five stars simply for its sumptuousness.But it's a bit too happy to be nothing more than an exercise in pretty violence and wicked-n-wild wonderment.  When the 300 men walked with jaws clenched out of the canyons to a you-gotta-be-kidding-me heavy metal guitar riff, I snorted Coca-Cola out of my nose.  The movie was ""cool"" enough before it pandered to its first-person, blood-hungry audience with a video game soundtrack.  And then it flips around and tries to be sincere, showing us a lonely wife with her too-cute son standing in waving amber fields.  She looks moodily out to the vanishing distance, and suddenly the theatre is filled with a crooning, Enya-esque musical score.  More soda shot from my nostrils.Filmic fromage aside, I still would've given the movie four stars for its virtuoso imagery, if it weren't for the horribly weak plug-ins that serve as the flick's only real source of story.  The movie flickers from battle scenes to scenes back at Sparta, where King Leonidas' wife, Gorgo, struggles to squeeze support from the Spartan council members.  Not only are these scenes unnecessary (completely unnecessary, I tell you), and not only do they contribute nothing to the plot (absolutely nothing, I say), but they are also unbelievable (truly and totally unbelievable).  Most of these scenes do not appear in Miller's graphic novel, and for good reason.  They serve here not just as fissures in the energy and heart of the piece, but also as eye-rolling attempts to reflect in Gorgo's gorgeous eyes and body a courage at least as powerful as that of her hunky hubby.  It doesn't work.  Boy howdy, does it not work.(Also unbelievable -- at one point, one of the Spartans utters the following line: ""I never got a chance to tell him I loved him.""  No fooling!)Forgiven, I say.  Because all I expected were astonishing battle sequences, vistas painted with adrenaline, acid, and ambition.  Those things are there, in stunning quantity and quality.  But let's not pretend there are deeper currents here.  Let's not pretend anyone will learn anything from ""300.""  Just like the fighters of the title, this movie looks good, but it has not much in the way of brains, and if you look closely enough, you can see the celluloid behind its bloody BVDs."	3.0	Testosterone?

But this one is different. Rather than using CGI to make things hyper-real, the approach here was to achieve an artistic vision. The ""look"" of the film is difficult to describe, and previous attempts to do so fail to explain how it perfectly suits the historical setting. Unlike many recent films, the CGI in 300 doesn't give the impression that it was used as an ""easy way out"". Far from it, the fabulous environment couldn't have been done any other way.

The other best-known line is ""then we will fight in the shade"" followed by that beautiful arching leap, which would have been so much less exciting in real time. You can't make it completely historically accurately (that would be History Channel), so play up the theatric. You can't get too far into the nastier details of Spartan culture (such as the helots), without the audience losing sympathy for the 300, so just leave them out. You don't want any actor to overshadow his character, so use character actors.The movie is visually stunning, once you get past its being a moving graphic novel, not a moving watercolor (which was the style of Lord of the Rings). The characters look like they were modeled on statuary and ancient coins. The 300 don't have 6-packs, they have 12-packs, and oh my, the definition of their arms and legs.... The Spartans are truly Spartan, in their words, their costumes, their sets. In contrast, the Persians are adorned with all the treasures of Asia.

The Persian army looked like one of Sauron's hordes (the Immortals made me think of Orcs) and the Greek traitor hunchback made me think of Golem.I also thought that the ""corrupt priests"" that Leonidas consulted resembled the Emperor from the Star Wars films.This being said, there were great combat sequences, and I think even the most pacifist-minded members of the audience could not help but be stirred by dialog where a Spartan responds to the threat that the Persian arrows will ""blot out the sun"" with the dry comment that that means the Spartans would fight in the shade.After watching 300, I looked up the Battle of Thermopylae on Wikipedia and found that history teachers and professors will definitely not be using it as a teaching tool.I also find myself wondering how the Iranian-American community and Iranians themselves will react to a film that casts them as something less than human.  I have a feeling some in the disabled activist community will also find the depiction of the Greek hunchback (who really did look like Gollum to me) as offensive as well.Bottom line:  300 was definitely watchable.  But I have a feeling that a movie that attempted to be more realistic would have been more gripping."	3.0	Ancient Greece = Middle Earth?	2007-03-11	18	8	10

Sin City was done on an amazing budget with un-paralled styles of film making in many years, but awesome and grusome too. This lives up to and exceeds my expectations many fold. Obviously lots of digital effects, but wow what a story!!! True to life ""He** no"", but the message conveyed had flavors of style from Gladiator to Sparticus. I loved it in the theatre and will watch dozens of times again.  Take a look at the Wikipedia definition of 300 and read the story before you see the movie or even to reflect on what you saw. Very cool story of bravery - that part was definitely true to form."	5.0	Did ya like Sin City?	2007-09-06	0	0	0

I was (or still am to some extent non regarding his turn to fanatical right wing opinions) a fan of many of Frank Miller's graphic novel and comic works, and also was curious about the hype. I saw the film, thought it was decent (though Zack Snyder I did not know directed the movie, remade one of the best films of all time, which is blasphemy in my eyes (Dawn of the Dead)), and went on my merry way. Then I thought a bit more. I already thought the whole perfect army of white skinned grecians (not very historically accurate) with perfect biceps and six packs seemed suspicous (if not a little homoerotic). Plus the Persians (all black or african american actors) seemed a bit stereotyped against (despite the controversy with Iran, as this review will detail, their complaints about the film don't even scratch the surface). Add in a strange subplot about a traitor who is a hunchback (and rejected from joining the ""300""), a gay ""Xerxes"", and the fact that the Spartans practiced extreme Eugenics (probably a bit exaggerated in this film), I realized I was watching a racist, jingoist film extolling virtues more in common with Aryan Nations than ancient Greece. It got more and more scary the more I thought about it. Hitler was against ""decadent"" Weimar era Germany, and the Persians are seen as ""decadent"" in this film. Wow. Is this a neo nazi film? Likely not. But there is something sinister about a lot of these elements when played against one another.I'll admit it. I enjoyed the film.

But, I can sum this up by saying, DON'T BUY THE HYPE!  This movie fails in several ways.  For example, the story-line is way too simple, and the lighting of the sets are a weak attempt at being ominous (ie: darkness & shadows -- Ooh that's scary! Yea, right! LOL!), and the villians are ridiculous (ie: an angry hunchback & a retarded ogre, just to name a couple!), plus the soundtrack is so oridinarily ball-less. And, to top it off, even the fight scenes are dull once you've seen the movie ""Gladiator"". ....Bottom line -- this movie can't BEGIN to compare!!What we really have here is an over-hyped, self-indulgent production which was rushed from theatre to video.Please, if you're really curious & are tempted to buy this DVD, just rent it first!

The king is strong but his queen could only be fit for a man like him...he married a woman reminiscent of his mother and the strength and respect he has for Spartan women is obvious...the underlying strength her LOVE for him gives him, and her wisdom...amazing underlying foundation to this story. I love when big strong movies do NOT have sexy airheads in the leading woman/romantic interest role.  When she handled the traitor like a TRUE Spartan...like Leonidas said, he might as well have marched the women up there to war, for all they realized Spartan women are like no other women they have come across on earth.  The Greeks must be so proud to be immortalized in movies like this!And the 300...everything you could ask for.  It may be a man's man's movie but it won my heart to the fullest from start to finish...men should be built like this today and only strong women need apply!

It feels like a giant comic book, which, I guess, was what it was supposed to be.  Visual and shallow.The film starts out interesting enough with the rough warrior childhood details, then veers into some silliness with religious elders (who, in accordance with traditional Hollywood perception of religion, are all corrupt perverts), then gets into non-stop battle footage, with occasional lapses back to a disinteresting sub-plot in Sparta.The battle footage looks like non-stop video game cutscenes (and even the 300 video game, advertised at the beginning of the dvd, looked like scenes taken from the film.)The spartan warriors seem more like WWE stars that ancient warlords (are they wearing tights and a cape?)Just silly.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2E9TRM8096BXU	"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson"""	"300: Being the Story of King Leonidis of Sparta...as told ""With Advantages"" by Frank Miller & Co.The city-state of Sparta is ruled by King Leonidis, who has several problems. First, he seems to have been cursed by an angry Greek god to be able to speak only in clich&eacute;s delivered at eardrum-destroying volume. PREPARE FOR GLORY! THIS IS SPARTA! PREPARE YOUR BREAKFASTS AND EAT HEARTY FOR TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL!) Second, his tiny kingdom is being menaced by the numberless hordes of God-King Xerxes of Persia, who demands that Sparta humble itself before his Pefect Abs. Third, his authority is undermined by a scheming politico, a knock-kneed senate and by his oracles, leprous cretins who sell out to the highest bidder. And fourth, whenever he opens his mouth, the Millenium Falcon flies inside and looks for a place to land, mistaking this cavernous space for the interior of a large asteroid.300 opens with an explanation of the Spartan state and its charming folkways. In Sparta, we are told by the narrator (also afflicted with a curse; in this case, the tragic compulsion to exceed the stupidity of Harrison Ford's narration in BLADE RUNNER) babies are inspected at birth for physical imperfection; the smallest flaw and they are dashed off a cliff before they can pollute the Spartan Volk with their Untermensch-like qualities. At the age of eight, Spartan males are driven out into the wilderness to prove their manhood by stealing food and fighting animals with their bare hands. Once manhood is achieved, a Spartan is expected to do lots of crunches and laugh in the face of death. Since ""only Spartan women give birth to men"" the Spartans have an attitude which could best be described as ""big man on campus syndrome meets THE TRIUMPH OF THE WILL."" This is the reason why Leonidis doesn't take to the power-pretentious of Xerxes (only Spartans are allowed impose their will on others!) and hurls the God -King's messenger into a conveniently located bottomless pit.Having committed this blasphemy (the first of many in the film; Spartans apparently subscribe the the heartwarming credo of the SS, i.e. that since everyone else is sub-human, human considerations apply only to themselves) Leonidis finds himself betwixt a literal rock and a hard place. The Persian hordes are descending upon him, but he can't defy his senate and declare war on Xerxes, either. So he does the next best thing; taking a hand-picked force of 300 ""volunteers"", he strolls off to a geographical bottleneck in southern Greece called the ""hot gates"", a narrow pass which Xerxes army must trevail if the God-King wants to conquer the rest of the peninsula, and there awaits his enemy.From that point on, 300 degenerates (or ascends, depending on your POV) into one seemingly endless bloodbath, as the faceless stormtroopers, er, Cylons, er, you get the picture, soldiers of Xerxes try to force open the Hot Gates (pornographic reference unintended...by me, anyway) using everything from blizzards of arrows to elephants to firebombs to half-human monsters, only to end up as spear-fodder for Leonidis' all-star killing squad. Every manner of hideous death is encountered, from impalings and slashings to drownings, immolations, decapitations, eviscerations, disembowelments, and dismemberings without number. Blood spatters. Heads roll. Limbs cartwheel. Wounded Persians sob for mercy (pansies!) only to be speared like rabbits by bored Spartans (who carry out conversations with each other as they adminster the coup de grace). But the Spartans just won't budge. They are like a brass-plated chastity belt across the Hot Gates of Greece!Unfortunately for Leonidis, while he cannot be bested by iron, he is highly vulnerable to irony. A deformed Spartan, whose parents (obviously sentimental fools) spirited him away at birth to prevent his brains from being dashed out on a rock, has appealed to the King to let him fight for his country in its hour of need. Leonidis declines, and in a fit of humilated rage the geek limps off to Xerxes, who does his best Satan impersonation (""All this can be thine; if thou will only worship Me"") and elicits the information he needs about Leonidis' weaknesses to win the battle. Or so he thinks...300 is of course closely based on a graphic novel by the legendary Frank Miller, which is in turned based off the real-life battle of Thermopolae, and on a visual level the film closely mimics Miller's work - lush-yet-stark, vibrantly colored, and hyperstylized. Unfortunately the producers went a bit too far copying Miller's style: what works for a graphic novel often falls flat as a film. The acting is solid, but occasionally undermined by clunky dialogue and continuously oppressed by silly-stupid narration, which does a terrific job of telling us what we have just seen and should feel. The pacing of the movie is actually fairly sluggish, particularly early on; the violence numbs the eye after awhile; and the moral message of the movie is a head-scratcher.Now I must say that I am a fascist, and so you would think all this saber-rattling, bully-worship and battlefield gore would appeal to me. And on a superficial level, it does. I reject the liberal arguments against it. But really, the film is frightening because it is far too admiring of the Spartans, who were first-class warrior athletes, but whose ideology as a nation-state-race was barely above the level of a drunken belch. The moral factor in war, as judged by Napoleon, is worth three times the physical factor; muscle and steel only get you so far. After that, it's nice to be fighting for something other than, oh, bragging rights about who has the biggest spear. And that's what this movie really is: a super-stylized p*ssing contest between a manly-man-tyrant (Leonidis) and an androgynous-god-tyrant (Xerxes) for the right to exploit Greece for the benefit of a small clique. The stakes don't seem very important, since whichever one wins, the average Greek peasant will still be handing over his harvest to the muscular boss-class and getting a lash on the kisser in payment. The fact that Xerxes is out for himself, while Leonidis is out for SPARTA (an extension of himself as he is of it) is pretty much semantic. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.I would be lying if I said this movie wasn't enjoyable on some levels. As entertainment it passes the test. But on an intellectual level it should probably be thrown off a cliff before it can breed."	3.0	Dining in Hell was Never so Fun!	2007-10-05	7	4	3
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"The 2006 historical action/drama film ""300"", directed by Zack Snyder, is based upon an 88-page graphic novel of the same name written by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley that was released in 1999 by Dark Horse.  The story is based upon an actual historical battle that occurred in 480 B.C.E. when massive forces of the Persian Empire under King Xerxes I (played by Rodrigo Santoro) attempted to conquer Greece, but an alliance of Greek city-states, including Sparta, fought the invading forces.  The book ""300"" and the film focused on one particular battle of the war: the Battle of Thermopylae, which was a very heroic last-stand battle between 300 highly-trained Spartan warriors accompanied by 700 Thespian volunteers against hundreds of thousands of Persian soldiers.  The vastly outnumbered Greeks, under the leadership of King Leonidas of Sparta (played by Gerard Butler), managed to hold back the overwhelming Persian forces for three days by fighting them in a narrow corridor situated between a high cliff and the Aegean Sea, having better armor and superior fighting skills.With amazing computer-generated special effects, wonderful acting, a great dialog & plot, as well as very engaging characters, ""300"" is an amazing, albeit violent, film.  To preserver the look and feel of the original graphic novel, practically the entire film was shot against blue-screen to precisely recreate the original artwork.  Hence, colors tend to lean towards the red & green with very little blue.  Also, some highly imaginative creatures were created to add a bit of mythology to the film.  Some of what was shown as far as what the Greeks & Persians had for clothing, weaponry & defensive shields was accurate (especially the wicker-shields used by the Persians); but the rest of the Persians' attire was highly stylized for the film.Superb performances were done by Gerard Butler (as King Leonidas), Lena Headey (as Queen Gorgo), Dominic West (as Theron), David Wenham (as Dilios), Vincent Regan (as the Captain) and Rodrigo Santoro (as Xerxes), as well as Eli Snyder and Tyler Max Neitzel who each played Leonidas when he was a boy in training.  Overall, my rating for the 2006 film ""300"" is 5 out of 5 stars and is highly recommended."	5.0	"""The world will know that free men stood against a tyrant, that few stood against many"""	2007-08-19	3	0	3

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2FFGQTFEDXR50	"Michael F. Dickey ""www.matus1976.com"""	"""300"" Is One of The Greatest Films Ever MadeFrank Miller's interpretation of the tale of 300 lone Spartan warriors fending off hordes of Persian invaders is hands down one the best films ever made.  Though 300 takes some artistic license and contains historical inaccuracies, the purpose of good art is not to teach history but to convey important ideals and themes.  300 is unabashed in its representation of the highest ideals of man, of clear cut good and evil, of right and wrong, and of a heroic defense, to the death, of freedom, justice, and reason.  The movie invokes and justifies feelings of empowerment and a renews your idealism, giving you the moral and spiritual fuel for your struggles for the good life by witnessing one of the most spirited defenses of ideals humans have ever accomplished.Should a sculptor capture the scar on a man's body or a painter a cold sore on a woman's mouth?  Are these encouragements of humility, professing that mankind is flawed?  Or are these dishonest concretizations of temporary flaws into a permanent representation of reality?  A beautiful Hellenistic sculpture glorifies all the highest ideals of man; honor, pride, intellect, integrity, and beauty.  The broken, disembodied, disheveled forms of modern art are anti-intellectualism, de-humanization, the destruction of ideals and values, brought into permanent physical form.Art, according to Aristotle, is in it's best form a representation of man as he ought to be, not as he is.  Art, according to Ayn Rand, is the selective concretization of abstractions of the highest ideals of the artist.  When someone chooses to capture something, especially an idea or principle, in a permanent form of representation, they are left with the options of how they wish to capture it, and what language they wish to convey the idea in.  A modern artist might try to represent a complex idea in an abstract and objectively rational form but when the manifestation in physical form of an idea becomes so disassociated from any rational means to interpret it, it is indifferent from useless Rorschach ink blot tests and is much more an indication of the irrational nature of the thought of the artists, the subjective psychological biases of the viewer (as the French paper Le Monde demonstrated in it's review of the film ""Hostel"" when it ranked it as the best American film of that year because they somehow interpreted it as a commentary on American Imperialism, instead of the violent pornographic sadism that it really was) and a thinly veiled abdication of any objective standard in art, than it is an idealized concretization of metaphysical value judgments.  Is a spattering of incoherent paint drops on a wall, like any Jackson Pollack painting to be considered ""art""?  Is a novel of incoherent prose ""art"", Is a movie with no logical progression, consistency, or plot, like ""Lost Highway"" art?  Is a novel encompassing an entire day of nothing like James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" art?  These things, lacking barely any objective distinction from randomness, or being glorifications of nothingness, are not art, even though they may hang on walls or have leather bindings, to consider these art, is to take any useful distinguishing character of art away from the word and idea.  Readers may disagree on what Aristotle and Ayn Rand considered Art to be, but any definition if held consistently which includes meaningless intellectual vomit indistinguishable from randomness, does indeed renders the concept of art without value.The proper form of art in a philosophy based on reason, reality, and life as an ethical standard is one that encourages a life based on reason, which can be tangibly connected in a meaningful manner to the reality of the witness to the art, and which advocates and promulgates a ethical system which holds life as it's standard.  Such art must be objectively understandable, but the setting, context, historical accuracy, etc are completely irrelevant to the conveyance of the message.  Art is a selective recreation of elements which pertain in and understandable manner to the issues we deal with in reality, based, as Rand, suggested on the artist's metaphysical value judgments.  Art is not a literal recreation of reality (cold sores, bunions, societal flaws and all) but instead is a recreation of the critical elements of reality required for conceptual conveying a message or theme.Consider then, what great art is, and understand that ""300"" is probably the greatest concretization of human ideals in visual media ever created.  ""300"" is not a historical documentary and contains technical inaccuracies from the way the Spartan's fought to the nature and makeup of Spartan society.  But if you want a documentary, turn to the History Channel.  This movie is absolutely NOT a historical documentary and to dislike it because it is not historically accurate is to assert that all art must be nothing more than accurate retelling of historical accounts.  Yet we do not belittle the great works of Shakespeare because they contain linguistic anachronisms or the great epics of Ancient Greece because they contained gods and monsters.  ""300"" is a moral epic told against a historical backdrop, containing real historical figures but representing them as profound human beings we can all look up to and admire, in situations and stories indeed conceptually similar to the factual historical reality.  Stories that serve to inspire and encourage us to weather difficult storms, persevere against obstacles blocking our goals, and continue to fight; not because we might win and not because it is our duty, but because it is being true to our own ideals in defense of our deepest values, that these are things ought to do because it is right.In classical Greek fashion, Frank Miller was not presenting Sparta (and man) as he is or was, but as he *ought* to be; physically perfect, morally absolute, passionate and intelligent, emotive and rational.  When facing the Persian emissaries, King Leonidas does not call for negotiations and capitulations, he does not negotiate with his would be murderers, he kicks them into a well.  When debating what to do against the coming Persian onslaught, Leonides abandons the advice of the corrupt mystics and gathers a volunteer force to face the Persian hordes.  When faced with the corrupting offer of riches and rule over the entire Hellenistic empire, Leonides, facing certain death, declines, opting to fight in defense of his ideals instead of giving up what he values most to perpetuate his mere mechanical existence, a life which would then be of self torture as demonstrated when he condemns the Spartan Ephialtas who betrayed Leonidas and the 300 to the Persians to ""a very long life"".  Facing absolute certain death, Leonidas and his mean nevertheless stay on and fight, knowing that delaying the Persians at Thermopylae would allow time for the rest of the Spartan army to join with other Greek city states and ultimately repel the Persian invasion - a battle which some historians rank as the most important battle in all of history.""300"" also un-apologetically and flagrantly disregards the false dichotomy between reason and passion.  King Leonidas is no barbarian robot, but a passionate lover to his wife, and passionate fighter for justice.  He respects and cherishes his wife, who is as morally strong as he, and he fights and dies for her freedom, not wishing to see her condemned to a life of slavery, while she fights to save his life.When ordered not to fight by the superstitious religious elders, Leonidas disregards their feelings and edicts and mounts a strategic defense of a critical area of Greece, ultimately saving every thing and everyone he values.The coming of this movie reminds me of the context of Star Wars in the late 70's.  Where movies had disco sound tracks and nihilistic themes, coming out of the 70's Vietnam protest and moral relativism era, Star Wars came along to tell an inspirational and uplifting grand heroic moral epic with a classical and powerfully emotive sound track.  Today in our sea of moral relativism and 'flawed' heroes (consider the plethora of movies that actually glorify villains, like 'Natural Born Killers', mock heroes, like ""True Lies"" and ""Die Hard"", or celebrate violent death and torture, like ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" ) ""300"" comes along to tell a powerful inspiring tale of moral absolutism and heroism.  I can not recall the last time I heard people cheer at a movie, and it wasn't just the style of the movie, it's the message as well, presented in a good style, that resonates strongly with people. I for one find myself filled with a little more hope for America since a movie like this did so well in the box office.  This movie appeals to our innermost capacity for idealism and invokes feelings of empowerment and justifies them.  It brings us moral and spiritual fuel for the struggles for a good life we undertake.Because of all these virtues, ""300"" has caused quite the firestorms of criticism.  Most of them center around the historical inaccuracies in the film, focusing on petty details, such as the armor the Spartans wore and the methods they used to fight, while ignoring glaringly obvious historical inaccuracies, like Xerxes being 14' tall and having a henchman with bone saw arms, neither of which had any remotely possible intention of being interpreted as a historical accuracy.  These critics ignore these things and focus on petty details in an attempt to undermine the moral tale of the story.  Yet nobody cries that Homer's ""Iliad"" is a historical falsehood, because it is not meant to be a documentary, it is meant to represent the highest ideals of ancient Greek civilization.  Nobody attacks Shakespeare for his inaccuracies in Julius Ceaser, nobody derides ""Beowulf"" because Grendel was not real.  Nobody attempts to argue that Dante's ""The Inferno"" is worthless because the hero travels into the fictional Hades.  The great works of literature last not because they are historically accurate, they rarely if ever are, but usually because they convey great human moral truths in a powerful story and in a manner which people can objectively connect with.  Likewise ""300"" is not a documentary, so critics attacking it's historical inaccuracies (especially in a time where historical accuracies are difficult to ascertain anyway)  are simply trying to make a name for themselves by attacking something better than they are ever capable of.Many other criticism lay around attacks on the Spartan way of life in general.  Critics will say that the real Spartans were mystical and collectivist.  They might ask, why not play this movie in Nazi Germany and see all the Storm Troopers yell in delight with the same reaction and inspired Americans do?  (Obfuscating of course the ideals which invoke the reaction with the physical reactions themselves, as if rallying in the name of freedom is the same things as rallying in the name of murderous tyranny merely because in both cases one is 'rallying')  Sparta, they will say, had slavery, was a heavily collectivist society, treated it's women poorly, etc.  In all these cases they completely ignore the context surrounding Sparta and the context of the Ancient world.  It was a world where EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING WHO EXISTED was a slave, and where most societies did not even have a WORD for Freedom.  Only the world of Ancient Greece even had a word for freedom (eluethera) to differentiate a kind of existence from slavery, and had portions of their populations, large or small, identified as free men.  Every Ancient Civilization had slavery, ONLY ANCIENT GREECE had freedom, and yes even Sparta had free men.  Only Ancient Greece had the idea of Freedom and the ability for men to achieve it.They might argue that one could represent the heroic soldiers of Nazi Germany in the same manner.  But heroism in the name of murderous ideals is merely savage brutality, Nazism advocated forced nationalist servitude in a time where half the world had decent (though flawed) systems which were based on freedom, where every culture had the concept and words for Freedom, and Nazi Germany actively crushed this.  The context of Nazi Germany was totalitarianism rising in a sea of Freedom and Liberal Democracy.  Nazism was a step backward in a world of freedom, Spartan and Greek civilizations were a step forward in a world of totalitarian enslavement.  This film emphasized the only bastion of freedom in an entire world of slavery, indeed, they were the first steps forward toward Freedom in a march which still continues to this day.  If you were to make a movie glorifying extreme nationalism and dictatorial rule, Nazi Germany is an optimal setting because it contrasts the concept of freedom embraced by much of the world, if you are making a movie defending and glorifying freedom and reason, Ancient Greece is an excellent setting as it contrasts the prevalence of slavery and tyranny which dominated every other ancient civilization.The very concept of ""freedom"" had to originate somewhere for it to develop into it's modern form.  Yes Sparta also had slaves, no not all Spartans were free.  But let us not forget that women in the US did not get the right to vote until the 20's and black men until after the civil war. Give the ancient Hellenes a break as the rest of the world would not even match their limited gains toward freedom for nearly 2,000 years. Would we chide a movie about the bravery of Union soldiers in the American Civil War by saying ""well women couldn't vote""?  No, every salient step toward freedom should be celebrated, and the Ancient Greek city states steps took the first and most important steps in that direction, and at the battle of Thermopylae and in the greater context of the Persian wars, would come face to face with the greatest threat that ideal would ever encounter in a victory whose repercussions resonate throughout the world for thousands of years.My only major complaint with 300 was that the Spartan 300 did not in fact stay and fight out of duty, as was depicted in the film, but in fact stayed and fought, even knowing it would bring their deaths, to give their land the vital time necessary to collect an army to defend the city states of Greece.  Though this is a historical inaccuracy, I cite it because the accurate story was thematically much more powerful.  Leonidas appealed to the Spartan honor code of never surrendering in the movie, yet it was in fact this very event which founded the Spartan tradition of never surrendering.Also, as Leonidas left his wife for the final time, the narration insisted that the Spartan code did not allow the expression of love or regret at this moment, as it would have been a sign of 'weakness'.  This, to me, deviated from the intense passion and love of values that Leonidas showed at all other times with his wife and the Spartans embraced.  A minor complaint, but it was out of place with the character the Miller had established with Leonidas.Additionally, Frank Miller appears to feel that true heroism is sacrificing ones life in the name of a higher ideal.  Sacrificing ones own life for a higher ideal, for something that is more important to someone than their life, is noble and just, but only when it is the last and necessary course of action.  Fighting for ones highest ideals, perpetually and indefinitely through the whole course of one's life, is far more difficult and far more admirable.  Dying in the name of a cause, many people think, is the highest and most noble sacrifice, but in reality it is a fleeting moment and temporary decision made permanent, Living for a cause and fighting perpetually for it is far more noble, far more difficult, and far more rational.This film is not about the Greeks versus the Persians, nor is it a historical docudrama, these are only the setting where a theme is played out.  Good stories transcend the backdrop they are performed on and speak to people of all eras because they speak to an important ideal.  The theme of this movie, the message it was conveying, the ideals it's characters were embracing and fighting for, was not in defense of mysticism and slavery, but was in defense of individuals fighting to their last breath for their highest ideals, but not just any ideals, specifically the ideals of reason and freedom.  The theme is of these brave men (brave because courage in the name of evil ideals is not courage, but savagery) fighting against the brutal enslavement of them and the people they care for at the hands of a murderous tyrant.Like great historical fictional figures of Antigone and Hector, like the true to life historical figures of Cicero and Cato, and Raul Wallenberg of the modern era, and countless others who refused to capitulate and turn in their loved ones or loved way of life and died because of it at the hands of murderous thugs, the theme is of these valiant people standing up for and defending what they know is right and just in the face of the most brutal forms of oppression and savagery.  It is a theme not only of moral courage but also of perseverance and overwhelming tenacity, of struggling through the most tremendous odds for what you know to be right, even if you face death along the way.For the purpose of life is not to perpetuate the mere mechanical structure of our existence, it is to perpetuate not just life but a particular kind of life, an Aristotealan Eudaimonic life, a life of productive and intellectual growth, a life of goals and challenges, a vibrant life of learning and experiencing new ideas, new cultures, a life where your highest values, the health and well being of yourself and your loved ones and the growth you pursue, are passionately identified and defended at all costs, and are never surrendered and never abandoned.  Where your passion and your goals drive your life and your friends and lovers are fellow travelers in your journey.When you struggle at pursuing your goals and values, think of Leonidas and the brave 300, fighting for days on end through piles of bodies, the Persian hordes in front of them and their wives and children in the cities behind them.  Know you have it in you to push yourself that much harder in pursuit of your goals and ideals.  But be sure your goals are sound and ideals are good, fancy clothes and big houses do not necessarily make a good life, and pursuit of the irrational may actually damage the things you do value.  When you are exhausted and battered, think of the 300 Spartans facing millions of Persians, fighting for freedom and justice and reason, think of their courage and tenacity and find strength in yourself that they as fellow humans found and that you know you have in you.  Always fight for your ideals and the things you value in homage to Leonidas and the 300 and your own highest potential.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3PPXVR5J6U2JD	"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien"""	"I have tremendous respect for Frank Miller, having been exposed to his reimagining of Batman at an early age. Miller infused Batman with mature dignity, heavy with grief over what he was doing but doing it anyway.  No wonder, then, that the tale of the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae appealed to him enough to create a graphic novel.I've heard that comics were originally movie story boards that someone decided to sell, so it's no wonder that, when the director has respect for Miller's material (as Robert Rodriguez did with Sin City), the end result is nothing short of breathtaking.  But there's a lot of ego and a lot of money in Hollywood, and it takes a clear-minded director to subsume his own inclinations and stay true to Miller's material. Zack Snyder follows in Rodriguez's footsteps and the end result...Well the end result was a theater packed with kids, who, five minutes into the film, become utterly silent.The movie's plot is somewhat beside the point.  300's really an experience, not a movie. It's everything cool about Gladiator's war against the barbarian tribes, everything amazing about Achilles' fighting style and six-pack abs in Troy, all the special effects of Clash of the Titans brought up to date for the modern age, everything terrifying about the villain from Stargate, and a whole heap of the Lord of the Rings' saber rattling wrapped up into one glorious, bloody fight to the death.Squeamish about gore?  This movie is not for you. 300 doesn't just show you death, it rolls around in it and makes it beautiful.  Limbs, heads, entrails...all of it spatters and smears on screen.Don't like violence?  This movie is not for you. 300 kills and kills and kills, and when the bodies are heaped so high that you can make a wall out of them, it kills everybody else too.Machismo annoys you?  This movie is not for you.  Men joke as they skewer their helpless enemies, make fun of Athenian ""boy lovers,"" and keep a running murder tally for who can rack up the most kills.  Gimli and Legolas would be jealous.Want to be politically correct?  This movie is not for you.  300 is a retelling of a Greek war from the perspective of the Greeks.  Persians are the enemy, and they are demonized in every way imaginable, both figuratively (the Immortals wear demonic masks) and literally (yep, that's a goat-headed monster playing the flute).300 is about a leader and his 299 best friends standing to the last to do what's right, to bow to no man when every logic dictates otherwise, to die for king and yes, country because history will remember you as a hero.  Back when we remembered what heroes were. And you find yourself cheering, because this is how many men secretly wish they could die...not in a hospital, not walking across the street, but with a sword in their hand and piles of enemies at their feet.I loved the movie.  My brother loved the movie.  My sister-in-law loved the movie.  My pregnant wife loved the movie too.And the other 296 kids in the audience?

Who cares if the actors are ultra-buff and the women ultra-beautiful.  (Okay, it doesn't hurt any.)This is the rarest of all movies, a riveting, compelling action movie.

It's a great capsule of the human experience that you must see to believe.

Spartan society was brutal, totalitarian, and slave based with institutionalized pedophilia. You would wonder why someone would idolize such a culture. In the movie, the Spartans are fighting for freedom, yet what kind of freedom do they mean--the freedom to own slaves, the freedom to murder, the freedom to molest children--very strange indeed. The movie starts out with a little, half naked boy, then he gets tied up and whipped. The men wear skirts or boy shorts and shave their legs. I am not sure what kind of hair removal system the Spartans used, maybe bic shavers or epilight. Also, all the spartans had specially digitized six pack abs and big pecs like Arnold Swarzenneger. I didn't realize that they used steroids back then. I found it weird that the Persians looked like dirty versions of the Shiite Mahdi army--sort of a slap at the Arab culture I suspect. It is a movie that worships maleness, militancy and violence. Even the special effects looked like more than a video game and the Spartans go ""Hoorah"" just like the marines or guys in a football. To sum it up, a very strange movie, but one that elicits some speculation. What were the people who wrote this thinking? Were they deranged, racist, or mentally ill?

It's like a video game with new bad guys for each level they ascend to, level 1, roman soldiers, level 2, ninjas, level 3 a rhino, level 4, 2 big elephants.The sub story of some guy screwing the queen and attempting to make the Spartans look like she was a hoar (damn amazons word filters)... what was that all about?

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A22GYZL1ANGQLY	Mike	300 is one of my all time favorites. The movie is so intense and follows a great battle story of the Spartans vs. the Persians. The story is based off real life events (the battle of Thermopylae). Zack Snyder shoots the movie in such a cool way that it is hard to take your eyes off the screen. From the opening scene of being born into the Spartan culture to the ending scene where it pans out showing a gigantic Spartan battle formation, the movie is breathtaking and very original. HIGHLY recommend! It also has a pretty awesome soundtrack to go along with the various fight scenes.	5.0	Intense and Awesome Film	2013-01-19	0	0	0

Just want to reiterate what most reviewers are saying, the picture quality is amazing along with the audio.  I saw this at Imax for the first time, and i don't know if it was because it was so packed but I wasn't blown away.  I have 106"" screen in my theater room and every inch of it the video quality was perfect.  I actually took some pictures of this film from my theater and put it on my profile page.So, a good movie, one of the best so far in 2007, some of the images are straight out of the horror genre, and there is a ton of action to go along with a visually beautiful film.I also read of Gerard Butler's grueling workout in Men's Health magazine and actually changed my workouts and did this for a few weeks.  I had to cut the pullups to 20 and the deadlifts to 20 though.  I included the workout from Men's Health's website below.  This was his workout along with sword fighting training for hours and other cardio, most of his day being a workout.For a Spartan-sized challenge to your daily routine, consider this your new fitness gauntlet:a) Pullups - 25 repsb) Deadlifts with 135lbs - 50 repsc) Pushups - 50 repsd) 24-inch Box jumps - 50 repse) Floor wipers - 50 repsf) Single-arm Clean-and-Press with 36lbs Kettlebell - 50 repsg) Pullups - 25 repsAll exercises are done without scheduled rest between moves.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A25LSNKTK8W9O3	Mike Renzulli	"This movie is based on Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name in which the story is loosley based on the Battle of Thermopylae that took place in Greece during the summer of 480 B.C.E.In this film, Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and 300 Spartan warriors fight to the last man against the massive army of Persian King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Facing insurmountable odds, the Spartans' fierce resistance inspires all of Greece to unite against the middle eastern invaders.Frank Miller is also the artist and author of other notable comics like ""Sin City"" that was adapted for the silver screen, ""Batman: Year One"" that the script for ""Batman Returns"" was loosely based on, respectfully. He is one of my favorite comic book artists.I read ""300"" when it first came out and knew what to expect. The action is fantastic and the costumes and real-life sets are very well done. While not much effort is put into the acting, the actors and actresses all do a good job with their roles none-the-less. Hopefully, Frank Miller will be pleased with the film's outcome and it was rightfully a blockbuster at the box office."	5.0	"""300"" is a commentary for our times"	2007-03-11	0	0	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1D1MIFRSG50Y3	Mike S.	This is not, and was never meant to be, a historically accurate version of the 300 Spartans.  While it is based on an actual event, it is an adaptation of a graphic novel version of the story.  If you are looking for accuracy or a documentary this is not it.  If you are looking for an action movie with great visuals, good fight sequences, and good (but certainly not great) acting, you will probably find this to be entertaining.  Personally I think the best performances in the movie come from Dominic West and Lena Headey. If you are looking for movie that is an accurate representation of the Battle of Thermopylae pass this by, but if you are looking for a good action movie that looks and sounds great on Blu Ray, then this will be a good addition to your collection.	4.0	Visually stunning and good action, but not for everyone	2012-12-23	0	0	0
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A8IENKKCCM2NF	"Mildred Bradley ""Greg"""	"""You bring the crowns and heads of conquered kings to my city steps. You insult my queen. You threaten my people with slavery and death! Oh, I've chosen my words carefully, Persian. Perhaps you should have done the same!""Funny comment coming from one of the most contradictory kings in history, I suppose, before kicking the messenger into a well and splicing the heads of Persians in his own court.  For someone so for peace and against tyranny, King Leonidas sure does have a thing for bending his own philosophy.  The Spartans live to die, live for the ultimate climax of being killed in battle, and the glory, so why really fight FOR peace.The queen says that only Spartan women give birth to real men, and I guess that's why their own unsatisfactory children are thrown off mountains or killed in the wild.  Makes sense, huh?  Dilios calls the elders greedy and corrupt swine, but in such a violent society bent on destruction anyway, why not just be rid of them?  Why should the king consult them in the first place?  Their advice heeds him against fighting the mighty Persian army, and I guess it bounces off those steel abs of his.  With being so concerned for the survival of his people, and helplessly outnumbered, it's a wonder that Leonidas does not realize that they'll die anyway.  But it's all for honor and being righteous.  Whatever.  We've already it heard over and over and over again elsewhere.  We don't root for the Spartans, we just watch them kill and be killed.I don't mind it being inaccurate history, I could care less, and I don't care about the violent content, or the message it sends.  I just hate that it's a bad movie.  The special effects are cool, the action is ok, and opinion can either be based on being intelligent or no-nonsense.  I like ridiculous action like the next person, and I don't mind the absence of plot, but I've seen this movie so many times before, and even worse, I've seen it done better.  Action and chaos between men fighting for freedom and a ruler?  Gladiator (not to mention being Best Picture).  You could say Ridley Scott repeated himself with Kingdom of Heaven, but the passion, artistry, and dialog in that movie made it wholly original.  Want crazy creatures and special effects set on never ending battlefields?  See any of the Lord of the Rings films instead.The script is God awful with macho spiel like ""Give them nothing! But take from them everything!""  You can hear a lot of it spewed in Gerard Butler's Scottish accent (in Sparta?) on the equally manly TV ads.  If you haven't seen anything of Frank Miller's on screen, skip this and see Sin City, directed partly by Miller himself.  Again, there is nothing new to see here.  Aside from anyone with teen in their age, no one will see anything in all the blood and heaving breasts but an empty shell of a film with few thrills for the intelligent action film goer. ""To victory!"" says Dilios.  Not likely."	2.0	Decent entertainment.  Not as original as you're led to believe.	2007-08-01	12	3	9

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AKJ9MEE93DG5O	mitchell5954	300 I found to be an entertaining timewaster, as well as fun eye-candy.  Zach Snyder may not be the best in terms of story and plot but I can always count on him when it comes to great action and great visuals.  He also does some great music here and there.  While he is not good at coming up with his own unique stories, he is great when it comes to adapting other people&#8217;s work.  I am not familiar with the comic by Frank Millar, but from what I hear the movies follows it fairly accurately.  For what 300 was I was entertained.The story is fairly simple.  It takes place at the time of ancient Greece.  The Persians have declared war on Greece.  A messenger is sent to Sparta to join them but they refuse.  Now a group of 300 Spartans led by their king, Leonidas (Gerard Butler), must fend off the Persian army to prevent them from reaching Sparta.The style and the action is what drives this film.  If you are looking for a deep film with deep character then look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a historically accurate film then look elsewhere.  Even though this was a historical event this film is based on a comic first-of-all.  This film relies on its mindless action, special effects, and style to carry it.  I found the style enjoyable because I had not seen many films with this style before this.  The action scenes were really good as well.  I even like the slow motion.  Many people dislike slow motion but I did not mind it too much.  The film also gets very bloody.  If you do not like bloody films then do not see this.The problem is that most of the cast is easily forgettable.  The only somewhat likable character that you remember is Leonidas.  He is definitely the character everyone is drawn to and Gerard Butler does a good job performance-wise.  However, I did not care for any of the other characters which is a problem.  Another thing that got on my nerves was the fake CGI blood.  None of the gore in this is practical and it takes me out of the film.  Also, the villains are very one-dimensional.Overall, 300 is style over substance but I found myself entertained.  If you are looking more an entertaining action film with good visuals then you should enjoy this.  If you are looking for more than you could probably skip this.  Also, If you hate slow motion or CGI gore you should not see this either.	3.0	A Fun Timewaster	2014-03-15	0	0	0

Mine froze half way through also and I had to flip to the standard side to finish it.  (Combo discs are the dumbest thing ever btw- I bet the Bluray version plays fine- I cant afford a player yet though).  I realize I'm running older firmware on the HD-A2 but I hate having to upgrade firmware to play new discs every month now.  The standard side, btw, upsampled is so good, it gives 85-90% of the HD quality. I paid $35 for something I could have got 90% of for like $16.  The amount of extras on it are quite good though and some are in HD as well.Here's my issue with the HD that everyone raves about, be it HD or blu-ray.  This movie was shot in film/blue screen and then was processed so much digitally afterwards that you end up with a nice HD version of a digital ""noisy"" film.  Some scenes look absolutely amazing in HD but doesn't all the digital noise in people's faces and in the skin of people bug you?  It bugged me.  I know they made it grainy for the look but the transfer could have looked different.  So this HD disc has fantastic visuals but it is not the technically, best video quality on HD.Re-review: Aug. 9, 2007.  Now that I've actually got the disc working better... I know why I like HD DVD better than Bluray (so far).  Don't comment to me about your format wars.  I don't care.  When I get the money, I'll buy a bluray machine too.  I'm actually down for more space on a disc becasue I'm a hi-fi guy (so Bluray would be the choice eventhough you really don't notice the difference on the same codecs used on a movie between the 2 formats) but I have to say the extra features on the HD DVD are more fun.  I just watched 300 again with the split screen feature that shows you the regular unprocessed footage along with the regular movie and it is very, very cool.  I liked it a lot.  So  now my new rating is....4 STARS....  The movie gets 4 stars because it's good but no Godfather or Shawshank.  But the HDDVD disc sets the bar for extras on a HD disc.

On IMAX the sound is 3 times as clear.  The picture is amazing.  On a large multiplex screen it is good, but just WOW! for IMAX.Now I'm a woman, and an ancient pelican to boot.  And I loved this film!  I have to admit, I am a fan of violent westerns (The Wild Bunch), Hong Kong John Woo films (The Killers, Hardboiled), so knew this wouldn't bother me.  And I loved Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, another artistic masterpiece.  Fighting, blood and death in the hands of a great cast and director makes for a great time at the movies.""300"" is so stylised, and the color so different, that all I can say is it is a masterpiece.  Like a great battle painting, you want to visit it often.""300"" has a rousing story to tell, based on a true event.  It is filtered through Frank Millers graphic novel, and Director Zack Snyders artistic retelling.  Since the story is immediately taken to the realm of storytelling by having Dilios (David Wenham)  tell of the ""brave 300"" we understand (or ought to) that it is from the viewpoint of a Spartan warrior who is rallying the troups for the next great battle against the invaders of Greece - the Persians.Outstanding in the role of King Leonidas, Gerard Butler, owns the screen whenever he appears.  At once fierce in battle, loving of Queen Gordo (Lena Headey) and his son, laconic, all with style.  When he stands on the battlefield eating an apple, as the warriors finish checking the last of the Persian dead and dying, it is an iconic moment.  Told that there is an emisary coming to meet with him, his men are fearful it is a trick to kill him.  But he says if they do, all Greece will rise up and ""they aren't that stupid.""  And after all, he say's ""there's no reason we can't be civil.""  Perfect.Headley's Queen is fierce and strong, and has her revenge on the villian of the piece, Theron (Dominic West).  It brings applause and/or cheers depending on which audience you see the film with.The battle scenes are amazing.  The one long tracking scene of Leonidas in battle killing about a dozen men as they charge down the field, is heart poundingly great.  Slow-mo as he engages, fast speed as he kills and twirls to meet the next - it a ballet of death.  Thank you Zack and Gerard!Just leave your cares and have a great time at the movies.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"In ""300,"" director Zack Snyder's hyperkinetic, adrenaline-fueled and &uuml;ber-macho adaptation of Frank Millar's hyperkinetic, adrenaline-fueled and &uuml;ber-macho graphic novel, subtlety was left by the wayside.  This a film that attempted to embody the bravura of pure cinema, and it got close.  The film, narrated by Spartan warrior Delios (David Wenham in full throat), followed the exploits of the Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler, buffed-up and battle ready) who led 300 of his finest warriors, along with perhaps 1000 fellow Greeks against the fearsome and massive armies of the Persian Emperor Xerxes (Roderigo Santuro, decked out in lots of opulent gold).  Politics and arcane law kept more from making the trek, but they almost did not need to.  The Spartan forces kept the hundreds of thousand of Persians at bay, using a narrow canyon near the Greek coast called the Hot Gates, where the vast numbers of Persians could be neutralized.But don't expect Snyder to give you a history lesson.  The back-story is brief and only a sketch, providing just enough time for establishing the blustery and defiant Spartan culture (which is done quite well) and for Leonidas to royally tick off Xerxes and give his wife (a fiery Lena Headey) a final send-off.  The film springs to bloody life at the Hot Gates, where the fabled 300 make their stand.  Drenched in the vibrant visual style of ""Sin City,"" Snyder's and cinematographer Larry Fong's battle scenes synthesize their style from a variety of sources, such the ferocious close combat sword jangling found in the ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the blood-splatter and gore of ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart.""  But they add their own innovative wrinkle as well, aggressively pulling the camera back on ground level to take in the jarring effect of sword and spear meeting flesh.  The sight of a roaring Leonidas and his soldiers attacking and holding their ground against the swarm of Persian armies is riveting, given context because Snyder and his screenwriters Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon made sure to flesh out the Spartan ethos of defiance to the last breath.  Throughout the film, they draw you in to this dramatized, and more than likely fanciful, Spartan culture, one that is fierce and fraternal.  It's enthralling, if not exactly historic.  If it is a purely exciting and engrossing cinematic experience you are looking for, look not further then ""300.""  You will not be disappointed."	4.0	Pure, Bravura Cinema	2007-03-10	14	9	5

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3P6V42BGACXSA	M. MOUA	The 300 is a loosely based adaptation of an event in 480 B.C between Sparta and the Persian Empire known as the Battle of Thermopylae. As the Persian empire expands into Sparta and Greece led by Xerxes. A Spartan king, Leonidas led his 300 highly trained Spartans along with his allies marched up to defend the invasion. Each Spartans knew their fate before hand but still chose to go.This movie is quite impressive, despite the special effects that at times looks animated, it blends well with the environment and its actors. The movie explains a little bit about Spartan culture...A harsh and extreme culture based on military might. Bred and trained from birth to be killing machine. At the age of 7, a male's military training begins.If you love Braveheart or Gladiator than this is the movie for you. It is not a chick flix movie even though ladies would love these half naked muscular men running around for 2 hours hacking away.Good:Extremely violent with lots of body parts flying, lots of action, a bit nudity, and a few sex/rape scene. Definitely not for young children. I don't know why there were kids as young as 10 years old were there at the theatre. How do these parents explain to their kids when the sex scenes were taking place. Parents these days needs to be more responsible.The movie was not filmed like a history movie like Braveheart or Attila. It is over-the-top extreme comic book action movie. When I watched this movie, I was wondering did this event took place in history or DC Comics. Extreme over exaggeration. Rhinos and Elephants are the size of Dinosaurs. Some humans look beast-like from Lords of the Ring. Ninja looking elite forces with non human faces. King Xerxes is a king, different from any other king ever portray in movies. This movie is different from any other movie that I have ever seen before. A lot of mixes between reality and animation and they are not shy about it. It is mixed together to make this movie different but somehow it seems to work. It gives it an edge over others.Bad:There really isn't anything really bad. Definitely could improve though.The story is line is decent even though the characters were rushed. The main focus really was on King Leonidas and few of his top people. If you love Braveheart or Gladiator than this movie is for you. It is not as indepth as Braveheart was but good enough to get you by. This movie would have been better if they added another hour to the movie to developed a deeper story and deeper characters. Even though I knew who they were, there wasn't an attachment to any of the characters. When I first watched Braveheart, I rooted for William Wallace to the bitter end, hoping that his fate would be different, hoping that someone would come rescue him and he be free again to win his war against England. I felt Wallace's pain and suffering. In the 300, I was in it for the action, nothing more. I was just waiting for the next head chopping. Didn't matter who died.Overall, most of my male friends and male co-workers rate this movie top 3 best action movie of all time. Many female friends agree that it's a great movie too. It's good to see a movie tailor for real men again. Hacked away. This is a no-brainer movie. It's all about hacked and slash.	4.0	great movie	2008-09-11	1	1	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y	Monkdude	After some amazing trailers and about a years worth of hype I finally witnessed 300 this morning. It was about what I expected. Great action, gore, music, and a just total blast. Gerard Butler sheds The Phantom of the Opera mask and unleashes a powerhouse performance. Sure it didn't show that much range, but he made me believe he could beat the snot out of Maximus any day of the week. The film is visually beautiful to look at and should earn some Oscar nominations next year in the technical department. If you liked Gladiator and Sin City, you will love this movie, for it is roughly a combination of the two. I have just read it made 28 million dollars on friday alone. What a start for a hopefully long run at the box office.	5.0	Worth the Hype	2007-03-10	13	7	6
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2XVA2OGDYKKD	Monsieur Valentine	OK I understand young people's admiration for this movies' explosive and riveting action sequences. Pound for pound this movie is a knockout!But all those people who fantasize the notion that this was a deep and meaningful depiction about human spirit and triumph, please watch it again. This has to be the first movie ever to depict an entire historical civilization as subhuman. Akin to goblins and orcs. Had a similar movie been made by Nazis during the 40's, this would have been called propaganda. I understand this was based on Frank Miller's graphic novel but illustrating the Perisan civilisation as such, is irresponsible. Some of the reviews here are testament to this. The romantic and poetic evaluations here are preposterous.  Human spirit should not be defined by foes and enemies. Open your eyes and the world might bleed a little less... and global stability might improve my stocks! HA.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1WRYTJI5FCJ4Z	"Movie Buff ""Anna"""	After the train wreck that was Troy and the passability of Alexander I decided that to go and see any movie that was adapted from the pages of history, one has to turn a blind eye and accept the fact that Hollywood will sprinkle it with stardust, romanticize it,  change the plots and endings, pretty it all up, tie it with a big bow and churn it out to the public.  300 was entirely different!  Firstly is was adapted from Frank Miller to screen and that is a huge plus straight off, then Zack Snyder brought it to the screen in all its dark glory.  This is noir film making at its best!!!  It also came very close the history of King Leonides and his 300 taking their last stand at Thermopylae. I'm not going to gripe about how they exagerated King Xerxes, the priests and oracle on top of that mountain, certain exagerated deformed monsters, (Ephiliates being slightly deformed but not to the degree depicted in the film). There is a lot of symbolism used here.  King Xerxes DID think of himself as a God like King and the Persians were a force to be reckoned with.  Sparta was depicted in a civilised light, BUT Sparta WAS a cruel society, harsh even, killing new borns that were deformed, not strong and underweight, training  boys for war and sending them off at the age of seven to face unknown horrors.  Having said that, I felt that the movie had the mood of war and death and watching those spartan soldiers fighting knowing that there was no hope, I truly felt the glory in their death and what it meant for them.  Gerard Butler did an excellent job of King Leonides, I could not imagine  anyone else playing him, and the rest of the cast were excellent.  I am so happy that they did not use the world's most famous actors, as I truly think that the film would have suffered for it.  (think of Troy and the campy acting of the overly roasted Brad Pitt).  And THANKYOU Zack Snyder for not changing the ending and having King Leonides and his 300 live and walk off into the sunset (think of Paris and Helen walking off into the sunset in Troy thanks to the over inflated ego of Wolfgang Peterson and his screen writer) For that is what I am most grateful for that this film has stayed true to the simple story of those Spartan Soldiers making their last stand at Thermopylae. Simply, a great film adapted from the visionary Frank Miller brought beautifully to the big screen.  Well done!!!!	5.0	The Glory of Sparta!!!!!	2007-04-06	12	8	4

After having viewed it (twice) on the big screen, I was not very hopeful to see it translated on to my smaller TV screen but I was wrong. The effects are still spectacular and the story is still intensely played out to the viewer. Of course you lose some of the grandeur of effects during the storm or the rhinoceros sliding toward camera dead center, but you gain the same breathless expectation every time the Spartans form their ""turtle"" to defend themselves against the multitudes of attackers.It's well worth the money, whether it's Blu-Ray or HiDef DVD--sit back and enjoy the determination of King Leonidas and his 300!"	5.0	Bring It On, Xerxes!!	2007-09-01	1	0	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3FCH3F908FD0Q	Mr. Alan H. Dale	"Half an hour into the Blu-ray DVD of ""300"" I switched off in order to belatedly study the Amazon reviews, in order to discover if anyone else found the sound so badly muffled, with mumbling, whispering actors, but it seems I may be the only victim, with the volume of our quite new Sony Bravia TV turned to maximum level.As I have several revamped 70-years-plus films on DVD, including the 1938 masterpiece of Errol Flynn's and Olivia DeHavilland's ""Robin Hood"", with clear sound, I am baffled as to why 2007 sound technology can be so crudely and feebly inferior.As for ""300"" itself, I wondered why they bothered to try to improve on the original ""The 300 Spartans"" film featuring Richard Egan and Sir Ralph Richardson, created so magnificently in 1962 with credibly effective Spartan armour and uniforms, not the almost-naked he-men ludicrously unsoldierly portrayal of King Leonidas's ""300""!!!Having endured the rest of ""300"", its music not too bad except for the occasional now crudely-fashionable overdone, mindless percussion, the sound quality was at its almost inaudible worst during scenes back home in Sparta, but very loud during one of the add-on interviews with producers.  The only character to impress me with credible portrayal was the courageous Queen of Sparta.As a campaigner for facts on global warming, I am well used to disputing reason versus fantasy, so I recommend study of Amazon viewers' opinions on the 1962 film, some damning or praising the 2007 version of the Spartans' truly 'magic' action in and around a mountain narrow coastal pass in what is now Turkey, long obliterated by collapsing sediment.I firmly commend the book ""The Year of Thermopylae"" by Ernle Bradford (Macmillan, 1980), which includes a now topically controversial mention of 480BC Persian King of Kings Xerxes boasting of Aryan stock!!!  Also now topical is Bradford's study therein of 480BC developments in close-quarters weapons, because 20th century former cavalry colonel Allan Mallinson's 1790s-1830s novels surely provide ample evidence for the versatile sabre to be reintroduced in today's British Army in Afghanistan!The 1962 film remains an oft-viewed treasure to me, while the 2007 Blu-ray DVD monstrosity is destined for the next charity bag.  If the film makers want something also stupendous to work on, I suggest they accurately study the colossal Sea Battle of Salamis, with the fleets of Greece and Persia confined to narrow waters, with bloody fighting across the decks of all the ships jammed tightly together.  There is far too much sheer magic in true or as near as possible true history for its needing to be fantasised.Alan H Dale."	1.0	"Whispering actors ruin the Blu-ray DVD of ""300"" -- or what?"	2009-11-28	16	1	15

I have to admit that it was a bit corny and parts of the story didn't really add to the movie/graphic novel overall, but I didn't watch it for the story as much as I did for the visuals.  The fight scenes are what I enjoyed the most. Other action movies like to portray a fight scene by moving from angle to angle and using a shaky camera style where you can't really focus on the character's movements.  I am a big fan of Kung Fu movies and American B action movies and the thing that drew me to 300's action is the use of time distortion.  The action slows down so you can see them fighting CLEARLY, which adds to the tension of battle and gives you a sort of adrenalin rush.  Maybe not Oscar worthy but it is going on my shelf next to Sin City, where I can pull it out and run it for drunk party goers.	5.0	Loved it...	2007-08-02	5	5	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2H22I2RWE0HOV	Mr. Sinister	300 is not the greatest movie ever made.  Let's make that perfectly clear from the get-go.  It is, however, visually breathtaking and filled with depth and clarity and lots and lots of fantastic images.  Born of the Frank Miller graphic novel, 300 is the story of Spartan king Leonidis who, when threatened with slavery and death by the immense Persian army and forbade to wage war by a group of inbred soothsayers, takes 300 of his most vicious warriors into battle to save Sparta from certain annihilation.  Waging a war against the vast superior forces led by the androgynous Man-god Xerces, Leonidis manages to hold his own with the Sparta brand of killing.  Based on actual events (loosely, I assure you) 300 manages to keep you entralled through scene after scene of ultra-violent battles and well-flexed abs.  Taking it for what it's worth, 300 is a highly stylized piece of entertainment.  Good story.  Erotic sex scene.  Blood.  Gore.  Decapitations.  Stab wounds.  Impalement.  Death.  And a hunchback with a funny hat.  All that is compacted into a visually stunning epic of Spartan magnitude.  If you came to see 300 expecting the new version of Citizen Kane, well... you won't find that, but what you will find is a fast-paced (mostly) CGI war movie with more catchphrases than you can shake a spear at.  Well worth the cash.  I've seen it no less than 10 times and I can't help but continue to want to see the scene in which the Persian messenger encounters Leonidis for the first (and last) time at the edge of the great black hole in the center of the city.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3BSRH09QVV3BH	Mr Sutapas Bhattacharya	I watched this film as it was on Sky Premiere yesterday and just had to comment about this ludicrous racist claptrap, worse than a throwback to 19th Century Orientalist myths.I had just finished reading The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity (written by an Israeli. A recent History Channel programme entitled Sparta actually had American professors exclaiming that the Spartans saved Western Democracy!!! Such brazen false propaganda and conflation of such distant and indirectly connected historical phenomena raises the question of the level of intellectual ability and reasoning capacity required to become a professor of Ancient History in the USA and the pretended impartiality of the presentations of Western documentaries. Kostos Vlassopolous (a real Greek),in his recent Unthinking the Greek Polis, the question of how modern Westerners have appropriated the clearly non-Western ancient Greeks as their supposed genius progenitors. Martin Bernal in his famous Black Athena: The Afro-Asiatic Roots of Classical Civilization also showed how Western 'Classics' had fabricated the myth of Ancient Greece. More recently, given that this absurd film ends with the claim that Plataea was a victory against Mysticism and Tyranny, one should note that Plato (a century after Plataea) is quite clearly a mystic and philosophy is itself a mystical enterprise for him although Western historians and Classicists have distorted the true meanings of Plato to make him appear like a modern Westerner (see Thomas McEvilley's The Shape of Ancient Thought). Furthermore, as McEvilley and others note, the Greek simpletons would not even have had philosophia and transcendental monism if the Persian Achaemenid empire had not allowed the Greeks in Ionia to encounter Indian yogis from whom the Greeks learnt of the transcendental and philosophia (the love of divine wisdom - a clearly mystical practise- Plato talks of opening the Inner Eye and being flooded with (divine) Light)etc. as well as transcending Reason).To all the teenage boys who watch this childish film, I suggest that you note the following. Persians were not Black africans as the early part of this film portrays them. Spartans were totalitarian, proto-fascist slave owners (not shown on the film) who went to war each with 7 Greek helot slaves accompanying them! The Greek city of Argos refused to fight with the Greeks as they were at war with Sparta and would rather be ruled by Persia than Spartans! The Persians allowed democracy to be maintained in the Ionian Greek City states which revolted against them. Most Greek city states were not democratic. Sparta asked the tyrant of Syracuse in Sicily to help fight Xerxes. As Isaacs notes, the Greeks were not fighting for individual liberty, simply against collective foreign subjugation. Plato detested Democracy. Only male citizens of pure-lineage had the vote in Athens (the modern West and its 'democracy' are rooted in the more recent Protestant Reformation in Western Europe not in ancient Greece). After Plataea, Xerxes invited a Spartan commander to a feast. As Herodotus, the first historian wrote, the Persians more than any other peoples acknowledged valour in their opponents. Sparta and Athens, after defeating Xerxes went on to imperialist subjugation and enslavement of other Greeks! Spartas success in the Peloponnesian War against Athens was funded largely by Persia!The Greek speaking part of the Roman Empire became Byzantine and the Greek Church the Eastern Orthodox Church as opposed to western Roman Chrsitianity from which the modern West arose. On a British documentary about Stalin, his father-in-law is supposed to have stated that Stalin was a tyrant as he was an Asiatic from Georgia. In fact, Georgians are the descendants of the Greeks (Colchis etc.)! Unlike Greece, slavery was uncommon in ancient India (in contrast to the Asiatic slavery myth). Modern Greece itself was partly the creation of Western Romantics (like Byron) whereas the natives of the Greek peninsula under Ottoman rule called themselves Romii and spoke Romaika.Thus those of you teenagers with a little bit of brainpower should treat this racist nonsense and the historians on History Channel etc. spurting their bile about ancient Greece with the contempt it deserves.	1.0	Infantile Racist Claptrap Projecting US Demonization of Iran into Antiquity	2008-07-06	22	5	17

There is no real plot or dialog, but that isn't the purpose of this movie.  This is just pure eye candy.  Watch it and be awed by the cinematography.	5.0	Amazing!	2007-07-04	4	2	2

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2TZNPWHFZFO5Z	Nappaland.com	"Plot Summary: In ancient Greece, the King of Sparta, defending the honor of his wife and his country, takes a ridiculously small army to battle against the overwhelming military power Persia.Reason for the Rating: Graphic battle sequences throughout, some sexuality and nudity.Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name, 300 is an eye-popping film about the ancient Battle of Thermopylae in which a vastly outnumbered Spartan army of only 300 men took a heroic stand against the powerful invading force of millions of Persians, commanded by the supposed god-king, Xerxes.From the casting to the costuming and special effects, it's clear that the creators of this movie deliberately sought to draw the audience in and keep them riveted until the end, and at that mission they have succeeded. This is a supremely entertaining film.300 tells the story of Sparta's king, Leonidas (played by Gerard Butler), from the brutal training he received as a young boy, to the isolation he experienced as a youth in the wilderness fighting for his life, to his triumphant return to his home, his coronation as king, and subsequent battle against the Persians who sought to dominate his people.The standard sex and violence disclaimer applies for this movie. There's some nudity and sexuality, lots of blood, and a whole lot of death to contend with. It's a battle epic, one that vividly depicts the barbarity of life in times of ancient war, including stylized impalements and decapitations and more. This is not a film for children or for those whose sensibilities are easily offended - in fact, one of the producers of 300 insisted they were trying to make a ""ballet of death"" and Entertainment Weekly reported that computer special effects were used extensively to ""create geysers of spurting blood worthy of Jackson Pollock."" So, parents, consider yourself warned. But also be aware that there is a message of truth woven into this story, for those intrepid enough to look.It would be easy to slide through this flick and be thoroughly entertained by the visual artistry alone, not giving the moral of the story one thought. Because of the producers' loyalty to the comic book format of Miller's original story, the special effects are captivating. There's a grainy, muted, silvery tone that gives the film an otherworldly feel that I couldn't take my eyes off of - and I didn't want to - even during the bloodiest battle scenes. The actors' skin seemed brushed with a preternatural glow. Outlandish creatures didn't seem so odd in this land, and even the ugly and disfigured seemed easy to behold. This didn't look like a comic book to me - it looked more like a beautifully painted work of art. No doubt about it: the creators of 300 deliberately crafted this movie as an impressive display of visual artistry, and they succeeding in that aim.But there is more here. This is a story about Leonidas: a man who, against all odds, grew up believing in the twin ideals of freedom and liberty; who, despite the abuse and violence he suffered as a child, would lay down his life for his country and fellow soldiers. A man who loves his wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), so much that he would gladly spend his dying moments thinking of her. There is a portrait of good here - though granted it is a portrait that's a little fuzzy in places - such as when Leonidas kills one of Xerxes' messengers who comes to Sparta to demand surrender.However, in this film Leonidas doesn't submit to anyone - one of his strengths, but also one of his fatal flaws: he has no faith in, and perhaps not even any knowledge of, the God of Israel. Instead, he consults the pagan priests and an Oracle (played with sensual abandon by Kelly Craig) to determine the best course of action. When the Oracle tells Leonidas not to go into battle against the Persians, he defies the pagan priests and the Spartan council anyway. With his wife's blessing, he rounds up 300 of the country's best soldiers to go with him to the ""Hot Gates,"" a narrow pass where Leonidas will lure the Persian troops and fight to the death for the liberty of his country.Xerxes (portrayed with a bisexual flair by Rodrigo Santoro) is a formidable picture of evil, a stark contrast to Leonidas' goodness and bravery. This evil king calls himself a god and the ruler of the entire earth, using biblical phrases of divinity to describe himself to anyone who would listen. His method of operation is to promise the world to those he would conquer, in words eerily similar to Satan in Scripture: bow down to me and I will give you power, fame, and wealth.But Leonidas, a real man's man, sees right through Xerxes' lies. The King of Sparta vows never to bow his knee to this enemy. He loves his wife, leads his soldiers, and doesn't shy away from even the gravest threat of danger. His life's example was a huge inspiration and influence to the nation of Greece.  However, back in Sparta, Queen Gorgo is lobbying for aid to her husband. In the process, she is deceived by the evil councilman Theron (Dominic West), who demands that she commit adultery with him in exchange for his help in convincing the rest of the Spartan council to listen to her. Because of her love for her husband, she makes an unwise decision that leads to death and betrayal.In all, I was very impressed by both the artistry and storytelling of 300. The only real drawback was the explicit sex and graphic violence spun throughout the film. Hollywood should know it is completely possible to make a hugely profitable, first-class battle epic movie without naked women and with understated violence. Yet, even so, I didn't find the R-rated elements of this movie to be as blatantly gratuitous as they are in many other movies; instead, they most often helped to expose the underlying motivations and mindsets of the characters involved. So while I would have preferred a more teen-friendly, PG-13 epic, I can at least understand why the filmmakers stuck with a hardcore ""R"" for 300.MOVIEBLOG RECOMMENDS:Adults only. This is an entertaining and beautiful epic with a message, but the ""ballet of blood"" may be too graphic even for some grownups.AFTER THE SHOW:* What did you admire about Leonidas? How would a personality like that play out in real life today?* What's your opinion of Queen Gorgo? What might you have done differently in her situation?* In Europe, critics of 300 slammed this film and it's ""fight for freedom"" theme as an allegorical defense of the United States invasion of Iraq. Do you think that opinion was warranted? Defend your answer.TG"	4.0	A Nappaland.com Review	2007-03-12	10	6	4

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3DDPQ9342UNMY	"N. Doyle ""film buff"""	"No, I wasn't expecting ""depth"" to the characters nor was I expecting to see a documentary about the famous battle at Thermopylae--and perhaps that's why I can happily state that I was caught up in the frenzy and excitement and visual splendor of 300 from the opening scene to the touching ending.King Leonidas (brilliant performance by GERARD BUTLER), is the Spartan King who must send his brave warriors to fight the huge Persian army. Butler is certainly not one-dimensional in the role, which is what would have happened in the hands of a less talented actor. He found many facets that humanize this ferocious King with an appetite for battle and he makes the most of his every moment on screen. Snyder certainly lucked out in finding exactly the right man for the role. In many close-ups he reminds me of the classic screen star ROBERT TAYLOR (think ""Ivanhoe"").And others around him are fine too. LEONA HEADEY makes an interesting, spirited Spartan Queen, with a beautiful face and a lovely commanding presence of her own. She's especially good in her scenes with the conniving DOMINIC WEST, as the two argue over sending a larger army against the Persian hordes. Their final confrontation is a shocker.Visually, the film is an artistic achievement that makes stunning use of the CGI and blending it with the studio shots in a way that resembles murals and famous works of art. This is one aspect of the film that is easily guaranteed to earn Oscar nominations in technical categories.Butler's command of the screen is more evident here than in any other film to date. No doubt this will be an iconic role for him.Only drawback is the sound mix of music and dialog which could have been mixed to the point where the spoken words are not drowned out by the relentless (but fascinating) background score, which tends to milk every melodramatic moment to the max.The battle scenes are well staged and I never found the use of slow motion distracting or inappropriate. Snyder has done a fantastic job."	4.0	Striking visual and audio feast...Gerard Butler excellent as King Leonidas...	2007-08-28	2	1	1
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	Frank Miller's comic properties have become ripe for the picking lately (Sin City was a smash with a sequel on the way, and Ronin was just optioned as well), and his epic dramatization of the Battle of Thermopylae is brilliantly brought to the screen by Zack Snyder (2004's Dawn of the Dead, the upcoming Watchmen) with enough style to spare.  300 tells the tale of King Leonidas (Gerard Butler in a star making role), who led his cadre of Spartan warriors against the oncoming horde of Persian troops commanded by the self-proclaimed Xerxes (Lost's Rodrigo Santoro).  With it's innovative blend of live action and CGI effects and techniques, 300 manages to stay surprisingly faithful to it's comic book material (including shot by shot references to Miller's artwork) while Snyder adds a political sub-plot featuring the Queen (Lena Headey) that paces out the battle scenes, surging testosterone, and bloody action.  The visual style is worth seeing 300 for alone even if you're not a fan of Miller's graphic novel, and the cast (which also includes the narrating David Wenham and The Wire's Dominic West) is great as well.  I've got to hand it to Zack Snyder; the man has crafted one of the best comic to film adaptations of all time that remains faithful to Frank Miller's original vision.  Let's only hope Snyder can work the same kind of magic with the infinitely more challenging Watchmen.	5.0	Utterly spectacular, one of the best comic to film adaptations of all time	2007-08-01	2	2	0

The movie is very gory and is just an exercise in sword and spear piercing of the human flesh.It is basically a comic book made into a film and should appeal to those who view death and destruction as a past-time to be enjoyed.The quality of the film as a blu ray movie is not fantastic nor is the sound track.	2.0	300 blu ray	2007-12-26	2	0	2

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3SU3TXON36T0X	"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos"""	_The 300_ (2007) is a film based on the graphic novel _300_ by Frank Miller which provides a fictionalized account of the Battle of Thermopylae.  In this film, an army of 300 Spartans must face the Persian army led by King Xerxes.  The Spartans are portrayed as freedom loving men who must fight to the last man against the Persian hordes who intend to enslave them (although this portrayal has been claimed to be somewhat historically inaccurate).  Most of the film is taken up by battle scenes, following the Spartan king Leonidas learning that the Persians intend to enslave his people.  Leonidas, who has been trained for battle since youth, consults the Oracle as to what he should do about the situation with the Persians, and is told that he should not go to war so as to not interrupt the sacred festival.  Leonidas disobeys the priests and the Oracle and leads his army of 300 of the best picked Spartans against the hordes of Xerxes.  The rest of the film involves the subsequent battle that ensues, in which the 300 must fight to the last man, greatly outnumbered.  It should be pointed out that the 300 Spartans are highly trained for battle, having been handpicked since youth and having as their sole profession that of soldiering.  Xerxes unleashes his army of slaves and many of them fall to the far more battle-hardy Spartans, who easily defeat them.  Xerxes appears in the film as a seven-foot tall androgynous god-king and poses a challenge to the Spartan king Leonidas.  While the battle is taking place, Leonidas' queen must face her own set of challenges back home.  Ultimately however, the conflict does not bode well for the heavily outnumbered Spartans.This movie is a decent film that reflects on the history of ancient Greece.  The imagery is unique and it is probably worth watching for that alone.  While the movie may be slow in parts, in that it is simply one battle scene after another, it probably deserves to be watched simply for its imagery and for the historical value.	5.0	The Spartan Army Faces Off Against the Hordes of King Xerxes.	2007-10-05	2	0	2

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A56TXS76PETEV	Nim Sudo	"If you are in the mood for a lot of violence, and prefer fantasy to history, then this movie is a lot of fun.  It is based on a comic book, and you can almost see the comic book frames in the movie, for example in the fight scenes which alternately speed up and slow down, and in the otherworldly processing of the colors.  There is a lot of testosterone-soaked dialogue, e.g. King: ""My heart is broken by your loss.""  Captain: ""Heart?  I have filled my heart with hate.""  King: ""Good.""  The priests and the persians, that is to say the enemies of the protagonists, appear as deformed monsters.  If this bothers you, bear in mind that the story is filtered through an ancient Greek narrator, and historians of that time such as Herodotus apparently had a tendency to exaggerate and to blend history with fantasy.  The movie breaks up the epic battle scenes with scenes of political maneuvering back in Sparta.  The latter provide good opportunities for rest room breaks, but don't miss the council meeting, where the tough as nails Spartan queen really shines."	4.0	cool comic book style, much violence and silliness	2007-05-30	3	1	2

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A117JJNOGBTRV2	N. Meyer	As the title for this review suggests, this movie is high on hype. However that makes it far from being a poor cinematic piece. The Spartans have been fabled as some of the best strategic and well trained soldiers in all of Greek history.To bottom-line it, this really brings you into their way of life. They live to die essentially, you will see how brutal Spartans are and how even against enormous odds their life-training is really what helps them fight against a massive force of Persians.Anyways should you get this movie?- If you like to watch dramatized historic events captured on screen. Then Yes.- If you don't like mild to moderate gore. Then no.- If you're expecting something that will just blow you away with superb acting, deep characters and a thick and juicy plot. Look else-where.In short, this is a very energetic revival of the fabled Spartans with a lot of help from 21st century technology.	4.0	Captivating Dramatization	2007-09-05	0	0	0
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1Y8238JIQN0Y7	nmollo	300 is an example of a Director so obsessed with the technical aspects of the film that he forgets the most important ingredient, that of the performances.The acting in the film is dire. Lena Headey is appallingly bad as the Queen. Her diction and enunciation are so poor that Drama Teachers of yesteryear must be turning in their graves. He listless interpretation could hardly have been less regal.Gerard Butler and his six-pack cohorts all look good but to a man their performances are all poorly developed and flaccid.The Directorial immaturity on display here is a microcosm of what is happening in Hollywood today. Young Directors in love with Technical craft seem unaware of the Actor and his all important performance. Just by listening to the child-like commentary by Zack Snyder gives the game away. He talks endlessly about the effects, when the set ends and the green screen begins, how long it took an actor to get made-up but nothing about his direction or the actor's performance. This is simply because he understands neither.The Computer Generated Effects, which Zack holds in such high regard, are pretty poor in the early scenes. The wolf is so badly done that it allows the effects that follow to appear impressive.This only goes to show that the Actor and his/her performance is still the most important aspect of any film and however much icing is poured onto the final negative.	1.0	Directorial Immaturity!	2007-09-17	26	13	13

I am glad that Headley's character (Queen of Sparta) exhibited courage and loyalty.  In other words there was no dumbing down women and the part they play in supporting or and nuturing their men. Okay-back to the main attraction.  Visually, this movie is stunning.  Every scene is eye candy for the audience and it is that-more than anything else that holds your attention.  For the first time, Dominic West put in a good performance. (Sorry, he does nothing for me on The Wire-good show though)  Gerald Butler was excellent as well as Santoro.  Overall: good entertainment, but like I always say-don't learn your history through Hollywood.	4.0	Simple plot...great CGI	2007-08-15	0	0	0
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A12FLZREV32JOP	Noelle Eiram	"It doesn't take a history buff to tell you that '300' is not historically accurate. And it isn't meant to be. Based on a graphic novel, 300 is essentially the story of hundreds of Spartans standing up to thousands of Persian invaders. Vastly outnumbered, the Spartans make up for their disadvantage with their warrior mentality and skills.Gerard Butler leads the cast as King Leonidas who must balance his love for his men with Spartan ideals of courage and freedom. (In fact, this movie is peppered with words of wisdom such as, ""freedom isn't free!"") His wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Heady) is as stoic as her husband. All actors, save one (played by Andrew Tiernan), have gorgeous faces and bodies. Butler and Heady are suitable in their roles, as is everyone. David Wenham narrates the piece as the tough Dilios; Vincent Regan plays Leonidas' right hand man; Michael Fassbender is the definition of a bloodthirsty Spartan, gung-ho about going to war. Tiernan plays a deformed hunchback and traitor when he is denied admittance to the Spartan army in a ridiculous subplot. Rodrigo Santoro plays King Xerxes. He is gorgeous, but bombastically (and intentionally) overblown. At first inspiring awe, his eight foot tall stature and deep voice over soon invoke laughter.Dominic West, as the duplicitous ""realist"" Theron, is a standout. At first appearing rational in his reluctance to resist the Persians, it becomes evident that he is a snake. His was the most interesting character to me, as there is minimal character development.Fight scenes are exciting, visuals are gorgeous, and dialogue is full of lame but arguable catchy one-liners. I expected to be offended by this film's simplistic portrayal of the enemy and war, but 300 does not take itself seriously. Like most movies, it gives almost nothing to think about. But it did give me the urge to shout, ""SPARTA!"""	3.0	High energy but almost entirely mindless	2007-03-14	13	5	8
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3UIIBJCSBLRK6	Noel Petok	"GRADE: C+A popcorn film is a summer action film, not monumental, that is a good waste of time, I repeat, a GOOD waste of time. ""300"" had elements of intrigue, amazement, beautiful cinematography, and despicable death scenes to boot. This version of the historical story of the 300 Spartans from Sparta is the most modern up to date film loaded with CGI (computer generated imagery) special effects. It contains buffed out men who fight for their country willing to die even when immensely outnumbered. The film that inspired a crew to make this film was in 1962 titled ""The 300 Spartans."" ""300"" is a typical film made for the MTV generation, fans of graphic novels, and the vast amount of video game fanatics that enjoy cinematic violence.""300"" was made by Warner Brothers Pictures in association with Legendary Pictures and Virtual Studios. The MPAA kindly gave this movie an R rating for graphic battle sequences, some sexuality, and nudity. It is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. He also wrote the famous ""Sin City,"" and put his own spin on the historical story of ""300"" that is loaded with a lot more violence and appeal for the generation from nowadays. Frank Miller got the drive to pursue this story from many viewings of the 1962 film ""The 300 Spartans."" The music for ""300"" was beautifully orchestrated and perceived by Tyler Bates, who is fairly new but is on his way to bigger and better films. He has the drive and potential to be up with other big names on a high award level. The film's screenplay, which didn't take much work having a detailed graphic novel to base off of, was written by Zack Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, and Michael B. Gordon. The film had an incredibly huge cast some may not know by name but each actor gave his all with the parts they were so generously given. The cast includes; Gerard Butler (from the new ""Phantom of The Opera"" ), Lena Headey (from ""Gossip""), David Wenham (as Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"" films), and Dominic West (from the new ""A Midsummer Night's Dream""). And, last but not least, the film was directed by newly found sensation Zack Snyder who directed a well received remake of ""The Dawn Of the Dead"".""300"" takes place in 480 BC, when the Persian king Xerxes sends his enormous army to defeat Greece. The Greek city of Sparta raises supreme warriors, and 300 of them are chosen to fight for Sparta to overthrow the Persians at Thermopylae. They go to war knowingly they will be outnumbered, but are willing to die to keep Sparta amongst the Greek. The battle is basically a suicide mission, meant to give time to the rest of the Greek forces to prepare for the insurmountable invasion. This doesn't phase the Spartans from giving the war their all, heavily determined to take as many Persians down with them as possible.""300"" isn't a film that is likely to be noticed for awards other than maybe an MTV Movie Award or any caliber award for its use of special effects used to perfection. It was nominated in roughly 5 categories in the MTV Movie Awards and won for Best Fight for Gerard Butler's King Leonidas battle with an Immortal creature. I felt, at times, mesmerized and in the moment with Tyler Bates' use of music but believe this is not his best work. I sense his masterpiece in music is yet to come. This film is nothing more than a good time away from life and nothing more. The only other element this picture had, other than its great use of blue screen and green screen, was its gorgeous locations and cinematography. I believe that even the cinematographer and/or director went a bit overboard with themselves in creating a huge wall that is made up of dead bodies. It is award worthy for its amazing special effects but I can't get myself to say anything worthy of this movie more than that.""300"" was loaded with extensive trivia and interesting facts in making this movie. First, this film, made visibly on a great scale, was shot in just 60 days. Next, Frank Miller wanted the male's of the film to have the same look as in his graphic novel, so he demanded them to spend the majority of their screen time bare-chested. In order to efficiently present themselves as a well-trained fighting force of the time, the entire principal cast endured a rigorous training schedule for 6 weeks before shooting were to begin. Also, in the well shot and planned scene of the Oracle and its elegant flowing effect was oddly accomplished by filming the actress underwater. Lastly, with Zack Snyder being mostly in charge of this film he took it upon himself to cast his own flesh and blood son to play Young Leonidas as a child. In closing, I'd suggest this film to those that consider themselves a part of the MTV generation or are just fans of special effects used to create a very video game like blood splatter effect. It is all of the above, gratuitous violence, decapitations, lost limbs, and just all out brutality in its finest; if you're a fan of that.Written by: Noel Petok"	3.0	"""THIS IS SPARTA???"""	2010-07-07	2	0	2
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A30O5R87QNMYTD	NO	First this is a pretty good movie, especially if you like action movies with a fare amount of gore. My low review of this film comes not from the quality of the movie but rather from the poor quality of the encoding and transfer to Blu-ray. This is NOT how blue ray is supposed to look. The clarity is very poor and barely above DVD quality. Unfortunately many Blue-ray and HD-DVD movies are like this and I am getting very tired of paying $10-20 bucks more for a movie that is only marginally better visually. I encourage you to save your money and buy the DVD version.	2.0	Good Movie Terrible Transfer Quality	2007-09-27	7	2	5
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3RBNLTA0UUFEZ	"Nolene-Patricia Dougan ""Dougs"""	"It was the time of Gods and Immortals.  It was the time of Kings and Warriors. It was the time of King Leonidas and his 300.It is 480 B.C., and the Persian Army sends emissaries to Sparta to ask them to surrender peacefully to Persian rule. Insulted by the Persians contempt for the strength of the Spartan Army, the Spartan King Leonidas refuses to kneel before Xerxes - the King of Persia and self proclaimed God. King Leonidas chooses 300 Spartan Warriors to stop the entire Persian Empire from invading Greece. The Spartans assemble at the entrance to a narrow passage in an attempt to stop the Persian Army's advances. 300 Spartans stand fast, holding off hundreds of thousands of Persian Warriors known as the Immortals. Only when the Spartans are betrayed do the finally succumb to the Persian army. Word of their bravery and strength spreads throughout the Hellenic Empire and their story becomes a legend.300 is a modern classic, a violent and beautiful tale of men who refuse to surrender to a totalitarian regime. It is a war movie with a surreal feel, it is a story that is steeped in mythos, and every chapter of this tale is lavishly brought to the screen in a movie that is as visually stunning as it is compelling.In movies such as 300, which rely strongly on visual effects to ""wow"" the audience, the acting and characters usually suffer. This is not the case with 300. Gerard Butler is bold, butch and brilliant as Leonidas; Dominic West is deliciously villainous, and Lena Headey is strong, elegant and regal as Leonidas' Queen. In addition, David Wehham's narration superbly knits together epic battles, traitors and political corruption.In short, 300 is a visually stunning classic that is filled with brains and brawn.  It is a must see for anyone who likes tales filled with heroism, glory, loincloths and six packs."	5.0	Glorious	2007-04-28	21	14	7

The director and his crew must have combed every available history book for any and all quotes to insert as dialogue. What a stinker of a movie.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3NL1KW56O3JR8	N. Perz	"First and foremost: 300 is not historically accurate and was not intended to be. Neither is it especially realistic. If you're looking for another ""Gladiator"" or ""Troy"" then look elsewhere.What 300 does present is an action-packed, almost comic-bookish dose of pure entertainment. Yes, most history-snobs will hate it (and I am a history snob so don't bother flaming me) but 300 is still appealing on several levels.Most striking was the cinematography; that alone makes 300 worth watching at least once. On that level, the film has a more ""artistic"" quality than other more ""realistic"" works. As for plot . . . well, the story is what it is. I think anyone who would consider buying this movie probably knows the story of Thermopylae. It's a great story even without all the special effects and fanciful heroics. (Personally, I think the telling would have been more powerful without the quasi-fantasy aspect, but that's just me).No one is going to win any acting awards for this movie but I thought there were a few moving moments in the film. But there's a significant cheese-factor too, which can't be ignored.Overall, I was disappointed with the movie. I knew it was based on a graphic novel and had adjusted my expectations accordingly but, even so, I had expected something more for all the hype. Oh, I'll still buy it (because it's Thermopylae after all and, as I stated above, I'm a history-snob) but I think it could have been a much better movie if there would have been more attention to substance and less to appearances. (I think I groaned out-loud when they threw in the war-rhinos...I mean, come on...)In the end, 300 is just an average film: entertaining on a (mostly) superficial level but lacking in many aspects. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. Sorry, but it's just not the orgasmic masterpiece that so many other reviewers would have you believe it to be.Recommended (with reservations)."	3.0	Decent . . . but disappointing at the same time.	2007-06-13	15	4	11

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z	Octavius	"Historical inaccuracies aside, this was simply a bad adaptation of the battle of Thermopylae in every sense. In addition to a poorly conceived plot, lifeless acting, and absurd distortions, the film is so far removed from the realm of human reality that it defeats its attempts at presenting historical events or any form of realism.The acting in the film is minimal to non-existent where dialogue is expressed through nothing more than primitive grunts and groans in a vain attempt at emphasizing the bravery of the Spartan protagonists. This is accentuated by the absurd portrayal of the Spartans as going to war bare-chested with only 6' spears. This is about as stimulating as watching the GIs in 'Saving Private Ryan' assaulting the beaches with only bayonettes and camouflage underwear. Realistically, I don't think the Spartans would have fared very well against any army with no breastplates and only 6' spears. For some strange reason, the creators of the film also chose to present the Persians as being either African or as Orcs straight out of 'Lord of the Rings' when in fact the Persians were an Indo-European peoples who were relatively tall and fair-skinned originally from areas around the Caspian Sea. For a while, watching the Immortals in their absurd Skeletor masks made me think I was watching a re-release of the kids' film 'He-Man' and the background scenery seemed more like the hell in ""Spawn"" than anything else. Although the CGIs were ok, the fighting sequences were as absurd as those of 'Troy' where our brave Spartan heroes break out of their phallanx formations to do flying roundhouse kicks to amuse their audience. Finally, the excessive machismo in the film made me wonder more about the artists' masculinity complex and their need to overcompensate in that department than anything else.To juxtapose this absurd rendition to something closer to home, this film is just as idiotic as if the artists were to make their own version of the Alamo where Lt-Colonel Travis and his brave Texans made their final stand shirtless with only Bowie knives against 100,000 blood-thirsty caricatures of Mexican soldiers looking like Orcs from ""Lord of the Rings"" and wearing 'Day of the Dead' masks. Caricatures of evil Mexicans enthralling themselves with tequila while assaulting the mission with vicious snarling bulls as if they were at a corida on the Cinco de Mayo. As absurd as if General Santana were depicted as a 10' dark-skinned caricature with an evil guttural voice encouraging his drunken minions to fight the brave Travis and his bare-chested Texans to the last.This was such a poorly conceived film that was so detached from any semblance to human reality that it seemed to be a rather pointless effort at historical adaptation: they might as well have made it a science fiction or pure fantasy film loosely based on the events with no reference to Ancient Greece as it really had no semblance to history or human reality in the first place."	3.0	Graphic but Lifeless	2007-03-30	10	5	5

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1XTWXIMUCDGQE	Oddsfish	"I guess ""meaningless"" wouldn't exactly be accurate; there's meaning in the story. It's just that what meaning there is in 300 has so little value.My friends and I who went to see this really ended up laughing through most of this film. Sure, it was pretty. But that was about all there was to it. Everything in the story was just so trite, and there's not a character in the film that's not a stereotype. Plus, there's no plot. The Persians are coming, and the whole movie is just the Spartans battling wave upon wave of the different kinds of warriors that can be thrown at them. The repetitive battle scenes are only broken up by a couple of gratuitous sex scenes and speech after speech after speech (six or seven) that all say the same thing--the Spartans are the reasonable people in the world, fighting for freedom and justice. They even got a Mel Gibson look- and sound-alike, and they had him give a couple of Braveheart speeches (though I liked that movie, which made a little bit of sense).Of course, there's not a whole lot about the Spartan society in the movie that makes it seem so free or reasonable. Infants with the slightest imperfection are thrown to their deaths. Boys are ripped from their mothers and drafted into a violent warrior culture where, it is made clear, concepts of love and mercy are anathema. If these boys don't survive their childhood, they don't deserve to live anyway. The ""philosophers"" and ""boy lovers"" of Athens are mocked, and it's made clear that Spartan society is socially and economically unjust. They even kill the defenseless enemy messengers in one of the opening scenes of the film. Also, King Leonidas's wife tells him the standard Spartan line, ""Either come back with your shield or on top of it."" Many of these things, I'm sure, are pretty accurate concerning Spartan society. But this isn't a free or reasonable society. It's ridiculous that the movie pretends so.Honestly, there's not a value in the movie that I could agree with. It's really out to appeal to peoples' worst instincts. The film is at its heart about violence for violence's sake, and the concepts of ""liberty"" and ""justice"" and ""duty"" are only cheapened by being in it.A common definition of pornography: ""creative activity (writing or pictures or films etc.) of no literary or artistic value other than to stimulate desire."" Frankly, 300 comes pretty close to this."	1.0	Meaningless	2007-03-09	93	31	62

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1YF0QVUV2IFQU	ottogrendel	"""300"" may perhaps be the most blatant and pure expression of Fascism from the US film industry in the last 10 years, which is saying a lot. Democracy is portrayed as a drunk adolescent girl. Violence and blind loyalty are the only virtues. The Immortals are in blackface. Ironically, the movie is hyper-masculine to the point of homoeroticism. And thoughtless hero worship is the political substitute for government. It is a slathering, puerile, racist, ultra-violent fantasy for young white males. ""300"" is the film version of Samuel Huntington's ""Clash of Civilizations.""To be fair, in pursuit of the graphic novel feel, ""300"" does look good. But so did Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will."" And that is exactly what this movie is, a cinematic display of the essence of Fascism. If you would like to see what fuels popular support for American war in the Middle East over the last twenty years, this is the movie to watch. In fact, a group of soldiers two rows in front of me at the theater understood the film's political message quite well. They literally came out of their seats in excitement."	2.0	Fascist fodder from the ghost of Leni Riefenstahl	2011-08-13	15	1	14

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1EDJ8271K2PW0	Patrick Gatti	"Although I am unable to properly judge, this film might be passable as homoerotic pornography properly suited to sticky floored theaters.  As cinema, it is a sad symptom of a juvenile society that embraces cartoons as art and spectacle as narrative.  The Spartans, whose existence depended on helot slavery and the crushing of individualism, are portrayed as freedom's founders and there is no word to describe how the Persians are portrayed.  While dehumanization of the enemy is common in war and war propaganda, never has it been so literal; the Persians appear to be another species.  The Athenians, who may have some rightful claim to giving birth to democracy, are insulted as `boy-lovers,' despite not appearing to spend nearly the amount of time in the gym as the Spartans.Fundamentally, the battle of Thermopile is an inherently dramatic event that should lend itself well to dramatization.  Nevertheless, the filmmakers chose to pornographize rather than dramatize and we are left with a series of meaningless battle scenes tied together by nothing other than their own increasing absurdity.  More upsetting than the sheer lack of quality in this movie is the reception it has received and what that indicates for our nation.  It has been said that `War is the health of the state;"" it is distressing when it becomes the health of art and culture.  A civilization can survive the production of many bad movies, yet it is certainly vulnerable to a citizenry that has replaced thought with stimulation."	1.0	Cartoonish Nonsense	2007-12-27	94	52	42

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ATJX2I6UR24Q0	Paul D.	"Another mindless comics adaptation, which once again proves that comics that work very well for that medium, don't necessarily work in another.  The acting is bad in non-action scenes, and just posing in the fighting ones; the script is a mediocrity; some action scenes work well (in the post-Crouching Tiger/Matrix vein), but others don't, and none are realistic.  The cartoon violence and blood is bountiful indeed, but haven't we become numbed and dulled by now.  In order to shock or thrill, does each new action movie have to top the previous?  Certainly Kurusawa films STILL have more exciting and imaginatively shot scenes, with only a fraction of the blood.  And really, none of today's action flicks hold a candle to the use of balletic violence seen in the breakthrough films of Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone or even George Roy Hill's 'Butch cassidy and the Sundance Kid'.  Even though the violence of those films was decried and argued about for years, the point was never the violence itself, they protested violence (even while ironically celebrating it).  There was much violence for violence sake throughout the history of the movies, but rarely in big budget, or top studio projects, the gorey stuff usually used in horror, exploitation or Hong Kong martial arts flicks.  Today, these cinematic video games are the main fare of American movies!  I can't even compare a product like 300 (or the even worse 'Troy' or 'Alexander') to those clunky classical epics that Italy used to pump out (Hollywood too!).  Certainly 300 has more visceral ""style"", than those projects from the 50's and 60's, but there's little atmosphere, and the acting, plot and dialogue even worse.  This is certainly no 'Spartacus'.  If you want to see a much better film, a fantasy film full of graphic violence, but also with fine acting, dialogue, direction, photography, editing, costuming, music and non-CGI special effects, treat yourself to John Boorman's 1981 Arthurian epic, 'Excalibur' (and skip any of the recent Arthurian movies, and Beowulf)."	2.0	Italian Schlock Cinema, Where Art Thou?	2009-04-20	1	0	1

First time I watched it I laughed at it a lot. The true heroism of those Spartans was completely destroyed by this film. But as entertainment it is a good film, but only as entertainment, nothing more than this. And I don't have anything against war, I am a defender of wars, I like wars. I have been a studious of wars during all of my life mainly WWII, I used to be a good fighter during my school years, I don't have any problem with violence, although as a martial arts fighter I really don't like to use it anyway and in any circunstance, because I learned to control completely my violent instincts. The problem here is that this film only serves as pure entertainment like watching the silly Harry Potter movie, nothing here portray the real facts and it is supposed to be based in a historical fact, that is the point the real point here. The worst thing was to portray Persians like black men, they were really caucasians men like the Greeks and were portrayed here as black men, this was ridiculous to say the least, It is a three stars film only because of visual effects. I have just removed the last lines of my original review because I watched this film again and I have to say that it's importance resides in remembering nowadays people about the spectacular courage those men from Sparta demonstrated, really their values are those kind of values I have believed during all of my life, in general I liked the film, I'm going to buy it.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1D3XQC2DIT	Peter Shermeta	"I saw it in IMAX. I had to. And you should see it that way, too, if you have the chance. If not, watch it at your friend's house - the one with the awesome home theater system. You might wonder why seeing it in IMAX was such a big deal when there were intentional cinematic techniques used to blur the screen - why do we need to see that more clearly in IMAX? You don't. But IMAX also offers superior sound. And if you really want to experience this movie, you need to be able to get lost in the sound.As far as epic war-movies are concerned, this is not the most original. If you try to make the comparisons to the great movies in this genre, you will be off base. 300 was not made to compete with the storylines of Braveheart or Gladiator. There were even many things borrowed from those two movies. Ignore that. 300 was a set of books, well a set of graphic novels (there is an important distinction), by Frank Miller which he wrote as his adaptation of the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC. His adaptation. That means if you try to analyze the movie from a historcal standpoint...again, you've missed the mark.Frank Miller's Sin City was popular enough that it would seem movie makers became interested in his other work. And comic book movies have been so popular lately, why not try graphic novels?Here is where I draw the line between comic books and graphic novels: In comic books, people die. In graphic novels, often times you watch it happen. The word ""graphic"" was not chosen by accident. I am generalizing, but I think my point can be summed up that way. And it is not always violence, but there is a greater degree of grown-up content. If comic books are PG or even PG-13, Graphic Novels are R or sometimes NC-17.Without that understanding, more people will want to see 300 than maybe should - ladies, I'm looking in your direction (and again, I am generalizing). It looks like an exciting movie about a few battles with 300 men in peak physical condition. Oh, and there is an incredible amount of (computer-generated) blood shed.There was a lot of shouting and Spartan pride. Some people feel that this was overly repetative and glossed over the genius of the movie, but many times I even found myself laughing slightly maniacally (out loud) at different action sequences and taunting comments made by the 300.I could not help the feeling of primitive energy that coursed through my body. Don't blame me. Blame 300. Or better yet, celebrate 300. Go see it and enjoy it as much as I did.Back when I played high school football, the night before gameday we would meet at one kid's house and either watch the end of Braveheart or The Program to spike our adrenaline.

All posturing, ""I'm bad, I'm hardcore, don't mess with me, bring it on"",blah blah blah.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AZN6WMC71MGWJ	Phip	"Ok I know what you're thinking. You look at the DVD cover and you see a 90% naked, screaming, digitally-enhanced guy and the title splattered in blood across the front. And you've heard the rumor that it's not shy to flash you throughout the movie. There's usually more skin showing at any one time than there is clothing. But this was their culture. It's historical. That said, I would agree that this movie probably isn't healthy for anyone who can't handle all the violence and exposure. Fair warning.But if you can see past that, or rather, see the sheer beauty and artistry in every shot, than you'll be able to really appreciate this movie a lot more. Because all this is mere eye candy to help express the underlying character sketch of a lost society where honor, freedom, courage, and human dignity were the pillars. Where you lived and died for that which you loved. Where the citizens walked free and proud under the sun, unafraid. The stark contrast between Sparta and the Persian's slavery, terrorism, and intimidation serves as a reminder of why we as Americans or British or Canadian, whatever your nationality might be-if you live in a society that believes in freedom and fights to defend it and to ensure that those who live under slavery and fear are liberated, that is the purpose of our society. Not to be rich or technologically advanced, but to live our individual lives in peace as free human beings and to ensure that that opportunity is available for everyone, to ensure that no one need live in fear.That ideology combined with the incredibly inspiring story of these 300's bravery in the face of overwhelming odds is what makes this movie so personal. We've all been to the place where we wonder if it's really worth it, if we're going to make it. Our circumstances might be different, but the feeling is mutual. It's at those times that I've turned to the example of Leonidas and his soldiers, who believed in something so much that nothing could deter them, not even death. Then I think to myself, ""Is this problem really that insurmountable? Am I going to let it take away my freedom?"" Because let me tell you, if you let your circumstance control your actions or your faith and belief in yourself, you have made yourself it's slave.Ok enough with the moralizing. On to the movie itself. There are so many elements that I love about it. As aforementioned, the artistry is incredible. Mind-blowing, really. I couldn't believe the texture and detail of motion in the shots, even if they were CGI. You just have to see it to believe it.The acting is not bad at all. In fact, I think it's the best performances I've seen from either Gerard Butler (Leonidas) or David Wenham (Dilios, the narrator). I especially loved Lena Headey's character (Queen Gorgo). I loved how she is just as personally strong as the soldiers to show that the strength was a part of the entire society, not just the military. She is treated with respect out of love: the citizens don't drop to the ground as she passes them in the street, but they acknowledge her with respect as a human being. And she has just as much place in the government and political affairs as Leonidas. Great way to show that manly men don't need to keep their wives under their thumb. And also that great men usually have a great woman behind them.Now you might expect that a movie that relies so heavily on it's visuals might be lacking in the screenplay. But oh my gosh is this ever not the case! There are so many incredible lines full of inspiration and truth. Perhaps my favorite is when Leonidas is torn about the imminent war. ""What must a king do to save his world.."", he asks. Queen Gorgo responds with, ""It is not a question of what a Spartan citizen should do, nor a husband, nor a king. Instead, ask yourself, what should a free man do."" Beautiful.I think ""300"" received a lot of stereotype as a testosterone-driven guy movie full of blood and boobs. But it is so much more than that. If you're too easily visually impressionable to see it objectively, than maybe you're not one for the Spartan ranks. But if you want an action-packed story, unbelievable artistry, and a moral that will inspire you to greatness, then Spartan, prepare for glory!"	5.0	So much more than just blood and sex.	2010-10-29	1	0	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A13DQTXG02HZC1	Ping Lim	This is a movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen.  For history scholars that look for accuracy in the documentation of the battle between the Spartans and the Persians, think again. Afterall, the captive audience is never intended for the privileged few. For those of us that had seen Robert Rodriquez's rendition of Sin City, 300's presentation is arguably more poetic or romantic with its brown grainy hue.  Every frames seemed to be well defined and planned & they are achingly beautiful to watch. Certain battle scenes defied reality such as 300 Spartans literally pushing back hordes of Persian warriors in the thousands; giant mutants, elephants, rhinoceroses added into the mix to defeat the gallant 300s until the Spartans were betrayed by one of their own. There were certain scenes reminding me of Hunchback of Notre Dame, Lord of the Rings, & even Gladiator. One must always remember to regard 300 as an entertainment movie but not a factual movie.  The reason being when Spartans fought for freedom & they spoke of individual liberty in here, in reality, Spartans kept slaves themselves (ratio 8 Helots to 1 Spartan). Perhaps, the Queen was given a bigger acting role so as to soften the over-the-top masculinity of this movie.  To make audience feel and have empathy towards the characters, at times, there needs to be a villain or two that made us genuinely vouch for the underdog & in this instances, it comes in the form of King Xerxes from Persia (modern day Iran).  If we were Iranians ourselves, perhaps, we would understand why they regard 300 as a propoganda to undermine its glorious history and culture. Gerald Butler once again proves his versatility in playing varying & memorable roles. David Wenham, an Australian is effective as the narrator to this movie. Kudos go to the whole team for being able to come out with such a slick production especially when the actors and actresses are only been given a backdrop of green or blue screen & imagination to bring 300 to the fore.  Once again, what's the story with the English accent in drama piece?  Highly recommended and an unmissable experience!	4.0	Achingly Beautiful	2007-04-06	11	7	4
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A33XNLBXNJH7YH	P. Johnson	"The much talked about criticisms of this movie have some basis. The Spartans attire is laughable, the monsters and beasts fighting for the Persians are ridiculous, the special effects (especially the animated blood and sepia lens) take away from the illusion of reality, and many historical inaccuracies can by annoying to those who know them. That being said this is still my favorite all time movie and possibly for only one reason, the first combat scene when the Spartans absorb the disorganized Persian charge, halt it and then systematically push forward slaughtering the entire force. This is the best history in the movie.The significance of highly disciplined heavy infantry of free Greeks fighting for their homeland against lightly armored conscripts from various eastern nations under imperial order. That is probably about how it looked. The names and Greek terms like Agoge, Carnia, Ephors and any I am blanking on are all correctly used, with regard that the Ephors in this movie are as poorly dipicted as the character of Ephialtes. I can understand litterally every artistic freedom taken with the movie, not that I approve of many of them at all, but I see historical basis for many of them and typical cinematic drama for the others.I'm not going to write one of those 10,000 word reviews to defend every point, but I have read more about the Spartans and the Persian Wars than any other military subject, and this is my favorite movie and yet I know that could have been several times greater because the actual history is that much more impressive. Lastly, the idea of racism in this movie is laughable. I remember and in fact still have the newspaper clipping of the country of Iran (modern Persians) expressing their anger over this films ""complete historical inaccuracy"". Aside from those inaccuracies I have already confessed the actual storyline is as historical as can be. King Xerxes, who was without a doubt a megalomaniac (he had the waters at the pass of the Dardanelles whipped for not cooperating with his plans), and led what is likely the largest army every assembled until the 20th century to march on indepednant Greece. And there at the Hot Gates by the Hot Springs (Thermoylae) 7,000 Greek allies, led by King Leonidas and 300 elite Spartans (arguably the best of the greatest fighters in the world) held the narrow pass for three days so the rest of the Greeks could get their act together. Other than two Spartans who had been sent back to Sparta the rest stayed and died fighting in a much better scene than the movie showed. I would argue that had their position in the pass not been betrayed by a local herdsman (Ephialtes), those 7,000 would have held the entire Persian army in check for as long as they tried to enter by the northern route into Greece."	5.0	It's Just a movie, with the singular greatest scene in film (coming from a Military Historian)	2010-11-06	5	3	2
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AN4WXJGF9ASPA	P. LaForce	For a film based on reality or history, it contains alot of unashamed fantasy and virtual reality. Yet it is pulled together in a balance of weight and seriousness, and the elements of escapism and brutality actually complement each other here. Were it all highly detailed and painstakingly realistic, it might be too laborious to view (unless you wanted a visual history), and were it more fantasy based it would belong in the Star Wars section (and no 'non-nerd' people would want to watch it). I cringed occassionally at the obviously digital effects on screen, but as a whole this was a VERY interesting movie that I definitely enjoyed watching and would watch again.The characters were respectable, believable and dignified, even though they are made to entertain us.The digital effects and scenery were rich and artistic, while being dark and non-distracting enough and thus only supported the interesting dialogue and scenes.It created a near-dreamy effect that played on the imagination and senses and made the viewing experince more rich, without the need for over the top tricks or scenes.This is a very sensuous film, all sexual elements aside.The elements of humanness or romance or weakness were not captured in a 'cheesy' or campy way as is typical for almost all movies (IMO) but blended seamlessly into the atmosphere of the whole movie all togehter as an emotional, political, social, and human drama.I recommend it to anyone who typically shys away form the theaters (like me lol) because this movie actually isnt that bad.

Unfortunately, I did watch it, and seeing how historically inaccurate this movie was really killed my viewing experience.King Leonidas never met Xerxes, and The 300 never left the pass, they fought there, and died there...I'm not going to list the things that were changed in this movie, because it can be sumed up in 2 words, ""Virtually Everything.""If you've never heard the true story of the battle of Thermopylae, then by all means watch this movie. You'll enjoy it, you may even love it... But for those of you who know the story, leave it! Once you know the true story, it's impossible to fully enjoy this movie. I tried looking at it from a fictional stand point, but it didn't help! There were NO monsters and NO mutants at the battle of Thermopylae, the Spartans DIDN'T dress like that, and the Oracles of Delphi were NOT slaves!!!With that said, on to the pros and cons of this movie...PROS: Brilliant coreographpy.Intense battle seqences!Nicely done visuals.Good acting.CONS: Historically inaccurate!Monsters & mutants of all kinds plague this movie! (I think I even saw a warrior of Enubas at one point...?)This movie proves that there is a such thing as unnessessary nude scenes, all the naked women in the world couldn't possibly save this film...The 300 do not follow their actual battle protocols in this movie, they break formation often, and don't implement several Spartan battle stratagies!Several of the 300 are killed by the Imortals, which didn't really happen...Viewing this movie a 2nd time in 16:9 Widescreen was even worse than my first time in Full Screen.The ending seemed terribly familiar to the ending of Gladiator, hmmmmm...?If they were willing to go so far from the true story, then why didn't they make it end that King Leonidas killed Xerxes and returns home???Towards the end of the movie, when King Leonidas' wife urges the grand counsel of Greece to send more soldiers to aid the 300, she tells them all of Xerxes past victories over other countries, and warns them that if they don't send help, history will repeat itself. At that point, one of the men who's working for Xerxes says, ""I don't need a history lesson, my Queen."" Then my brother blurted out, ""Yeah, but this movie sure does..."" Hence the title of my review.Overall: This is a great movie if you're a woman, since pretty much the whole movie consists of nothing but muscular Greek men running about half naked. And if you've never heard the true story, then you'll probably enjoy this movie. But for those of us who know the actual historical account of the 300 and the battle at thermopylae, you're better off watching one of the following movies that are similar in some ways to The 300, but better overall...""Gladiator""""Brave Heart""""The Last Samurai""""The Mummy""""The Mummy Returns""""The Scorpion King""Overall Rating: 1.9 starsWith that said, come back, MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000)...

Oh	A retelling of the ancient Battle of Thermopylae but adapted from Frank Miller's Graphic Novel offers over stylized battle scenes at the expense of story. 300's major flaws are how it makes this heroic story of 300 Spartans a flat and dreary affair outside of it's CGI - in fact you'll think you've seen it before because it rips off every sword and sandal epic up through Gladiator. In fact 300 freely borrows its soundtrack, dramatic presence and iconic imagery from that film. Gladiator is recent enough in moviegoers minds that the blatant ripoffs are truly lazy and cheesy. The other flaw is a cringe worthy script that in light of current headlines are so simplistic and aggrandizing as to make one wonder if comic books are all the filmakers read(apart from Gladiator that is).	2.0	300....only on a scale of 1000 - 2 stars!	2007-08-05	16	7	9

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ	Private Quentin Tarantino Fan	300 is the movie that goofy, melodramatic, silly historical war films like Braveheart and The Last of the Mohicans should have been.  300 wastes no time with stupid overblown, overplayed love stories (though there is a scene of $#% here), scenes of hair ripping tepidness, or a hokey in the middle of road tone that murders both films.  300 goes for the entire deep end and gives us an over the top, glorious, OPERATIC, no-holds barred depiction of being an ancient warrior.  There's no attempts of meaningful poignant drama here, and it sure as hell ain't subtle.  300 makes Spartacus look like Pride and Prejudice.Make no mistake, 300 is a war film along with comic book and action, though certainly not your traditional, typical war film.  This is a bloody, over-the-top, and utterly insane depiction of war that will appeal to any guy's inner warrior.  Sounds lame, but it's true.  This is as simple as a depiction of war you can get.  There's no soft sides, there's no morality issues, and there's no mixed emotions involved.  These men are made to kill, and protect their country with honor, and nothing else.  Yeah, it's occasionally silly, and it's definitely not a movie to be taken seriously.  But it's no holds barred, unapologetic fantasy war epic that has more testosterone than a thousand protein shakes in a row.I wouldn't quite say it depicts the Persians as pure evil and most of them as soldiers, but it certainly draws a not so subtle line between the two armies.  Anybody who is offended by stereotypes will want to steer away from 300 rather quickly.  One of 300's main criticisms is the depictions of the Ancient Persians, especially the king.  Truthfully, I feel there are stereotypes, but most of the persian soldiers are, as a matter of fact, just treated like regular soldiers; I never see them as freaks or evil entities.  Despite that, there is a definite bias against the Persians, but that wasn't the point anyway.  This film was certainly not to represent Zack Snyder and Frank Miller's view on reality.Anyway, 300 is essentially a fanciful, operatic re-telling of the Battle of Thermopylae, where 300 battled a severe number of Persians against unmeasurable odds....and lost.  What is largely an ordinary war story is brought to life in honor, a fantastic, stylized, epic re-imagining, filled with monsters, lot's of blood and thunder, bombastic musical scores, high use of stylized violence, and beautiful, sepia-toned visuals.  The Greek and Persian war is depicted at maximum stylized indulgence, it waters down nothing and cranks all of the traits (musical score, visuals, dialogue) to the max.  The feel is a bit hard to describe, and I can metaphor this with everything from God Of War (awesome game series by the way) to Clash of the Titans, but it wouldn't matter anyway.  All you will have to do is see for yourself and you'll know what I mean.I won't go into the details regarding the historical inaccuracies, that's not even the point anyway.  For some reason, Zack Snyder says that the movie is about 90 percent accurate, and that historians actually say it's accurate (how's that for an interesting alternate opinion).  Frankly, I don't know if that's remotely true, but it's an interesting counterpoint to the people who think it's the most inaccurate disgraces to history known to man.  Whether that's true or not, 300 can get away with being inaccurate, so it doesn't matter much.Everybody knows what makes 300 stand out is it's style.  Sure, it's not for everybody, but the ultra-stylized blue-screen visuals are visually stunning, that shine with a golden glow, heightening the operatic and bombastic style of the film.  Over 8631 visual effect elements were used in the film, and it leads for some cutting-edge, visually dazzling elements, eye candy as the best kind.  Furthermore, Zack Snyder's direction and the score is another element that's crucial to 300's style.  Snyder's excessive use of slow motion is in great supply here, letting us highlight, stylishly, combat, things falling, and key moments to draw out the drama.  The score is a bit varied, but it's always colorful, operatic, and animated to make this movie as over the top and crazy as possible.  Can't forget the narration done by David Wenham, which gives the feel of a mythological narrative.  He adds to the film as much as Jim Dale did for Pushing DaisiesTo be told, 300 really doesn't have as much action as one might think, as I truthfully feel that 300 is more of a war movie than an action movie, albeit one that takes seriously liberties (though you probably know that already).  As a matter of fact, I think The Thin Red Line has more combat depicted than this film, or at least among the same amount.  When the action does start, however, it's a bloody, gory good time.  It's mostly hand to hand combat.  Every stab, cut, and bleeding is emphasized here, and it makes for a blast of a film.300 gets criticisms for it's characters, and while I think criticisms are valid, I have to admit I don't find them as lifeless as people are making it out to be.  While these men are truly supposed to be fearless warriors who will stop and nothing to win, I feel that many of them seem to actually have a shred of humanism at times.  There's no layers to these people, and they push dependable buttons, but certainly likeable.  As I said before, the Persian soldiers seem to be viewed from a distance, we don't know most of these soldiers, so who are we to judge them? Faceless (with some awkward doses of homoeroticism), yes, but certainly not portrayed as evil.300 is certainly not for everybody, but if you are looking for an endlessly entertaining and non-tepid,animated look at ancient greek combat, and can handle a bit of silliness at times, 300 is your movie.

""this is the world I have created...you'd better believe it"" and you really do.Oh, and the era of using dummies, splicing and editing tricks to achieve beheadings is long past... wait 'til you see the realism of running men losing limbs while attacking... entirely different use of computer technology than predecessors such as ""Kill Bill"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". I also dislike that cheap sped-up effect in films like ""Gladiator""....better use of film speed here. nice!All in all, this movie LIVES UP TO ALL THE HYPE SURROUNDING IT... something I never see personally (except for ""An Insignifacant Truth"" which also did)."	5.0	skeptical of all this HYPE...	2007-03-25	7	5	2

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3PU2A1E07FZXP	putertech	This movie is very well done, but relies heavily on special effects. The cinematography is very comicbookish with some kind of digital effects throughout most of the movie. If you are looking for a factual retelling then look else where as this is an adaption of a graphic novel from Frank Miller (look him up if you don't know who he is) that totally embellishes the story and leaves out a lot. That said, this movie is fantastically done and is very entertaining to watch. It is the classic story of right, might and corruption in politics with the selfless sacrifice triumphing over evil.

Much much better than both the Alexander and Troy movies (1 stars movies) - but definitely inferior to Gladiator(4.5 stars to me).BUT.Although this is a Hollywood production and not that of the History channel:1) Persians look like deformed monsters and very unsophisticated. This is insulting to their civilization that had achieved a lot by 480BC.2) The Greeks fight like barbarians - only twice do they fight in phalanx formation - the rest of the time they fight as mad barbarians more appropriately resembling battles of the dark ages.3) When out routed - the Spartans seem to want to stay to defend the pass - just because they desperately want a ""beautiful death"" - very little hinted on the idea that they stayed to cover the retreat of their fellow allies.4) There is no Athenian figure at all through out the movie. It is made to look as if Athens was minimally involved. They were in fact flanking the Spartans with their fleet.5) I'm half Greek and the history of the Persian Wars is very dear to me as to all Greeks. However, I did not feel emotional at the death of the Spartans in the movie - something that instead I did feel reading the book by Steven Pressfield ""Gates of Fire"".Nevertheless, it is a good movie and entertaining which should inspire people to read about the history and how the Persian Wars were key to the outcome of Western civilization."	3.0	Entertaining.

When I first heard about this movie, I thought it would be a testosterone-fuelled flick that only the guys would like (yeah, I'm a woman) and would be so blood-soaked that I would spend most of the movie staring at the floor. It wasn't until someone told me that the violence & blood was stylized, and not in your face gruesome that I went to see it and WOW, double-WOW, I loved it!! The movie is based on true historical events and possesses those timeless aspects of love, betrayal, honor, courage, bravery in the face of insurmountable odds, and oh yeah - kick *ss fighting for the good cause, that make a story great. I found the stylized cinematography of the movie suited it perfectly, and in fact ramped up the drama. It has a rock 'n roll edge, but with lots of substance & heart. The actors were perfectly cast and delivered outstanding & powerful performances that move you. I also really liked Queen Gorgo, a very strong female character who her husband admires, adores, and listens to, and who does what she can to fight for her family and her people...and did I mention the oodles of eye candy for the girls?! See ladies, this movie's got barrels of enjoyment for you, too! ;)This movie reminded me that what we do in this life matters, that our character, our courage can and do make a difference, in ways we may never know and never be able to predict.

Casper ""Bob Casper"""	"It's this year's first real ""Feel Good"" violent bloody massacre film, that is, if you are not an Islamic Fundamental Terrorist (from Iran). After all if Javad Shamqadri, cultural advisor to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad does not want you to see this film, what is that saying?All kidding aside, this is what happened during WWII and for that matter the cold-war.  Unfortunately for the Islamic Fundamental Terrorist (and Iran), just like the Fascists and Communists before them, ""Hollywood"" (for all its faults) is the ultimate propaganda machine.  This propaganda machine serves and is motivated by its intended audience which only seems to flourish in a free society.Even though it is inspired by a comic book, we are not talking about a kid's comic book (yes there are adults who read comics intended for adult audiences). So, I understand that this film is most definitely NOT for children, teenagers or any one who can not understand or deal with the complete and total violence of war.  Its commentary on the War On Terror is, I think, unintended.  However, if you are an adult and understand that we are at war, you will appreciate this film.The look of the film captures the feel of the comic artistry, its straight forward storyline fallows that of the limited series with the same title (loosely based on the Greek/Persian Wars).  As with the comic there are cultural aspects both exploited and missing from all sides in this story.  And, like most films based on literary works there are some missing elements here and there.  Once all is said and done, we vote with our ticket/DVD purchases.  The record setting take on opening week indicates that Hollywood's propaganda machine has, once again,  achieved a direct hit.  Also, look for this film to be remembered in 2008 for its visual effects during award season."	5.0	300 and the War on Terror	2007-03-13	12	9	3
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3BK5X0GPKQ1J	"R. Celaya ""frankphotography"""	"""300"" is beautiful - each scene based on a panel from Frank Miller's comic series.  I caught a special screening in San Francisco 3 days before the official release.  It much more effective than Miller's other comic translated to film, ""Sin City"", because this film has both a heart and a meaningful message.  You can get a description of the plot elsewhere, so I will focus on the film's strength and weaknesses.  As I said above it is frame-by-frame beautiful - including every drop of splattered blood that flies across the screen.  You also feel the love and camaraderie of the soldiers to each other and Leonidas to his wife. And most importantly, their dedication to what is right versus what is easy.  With that said, there are some flaws that kept me from rating the film higher.  (1) David Wenham's voice-over narration is lack-luster - it really needed a voice that captivated you but instead you become aware of the stilted language; (2) Rodrigo Santoro's voice, as Xerxes, is heavily processed - I couldn't tell if he was dubbed with the voice of another actor (like Clinton Spilsbury in the ""Legend of the Lone Ranger""); (3) Although Gerard Butler is overall good in the role of Leonidas, he grunts much of his dialogue as if he was constipated; (4) The makeup used for the hunchback is awful.  In the previews I thought he was computer-generated but instead the actor has a large bumpy plastic lump on his face and back - with all the wonder creative and computer artistry in the film, they couldn't have come up with a better design? With all the said, I still salute director Zack Snyder's effort and plan to see ""300"" at least one more time on the IMAX screen."	3.0	Beautiful to Behold	2007-03-07	16	7	9

I personally wanted to see the movie about one of the best known battles in human history and the bravery of the Greeks from Sparta.  Battle of Themopylae has ben immortalized in history, myth and legend.  In this film, I liked the sly humor of these manly man.  There are portrayed not only as a brave and selfless soldiers, but they get to show us that they are smart and witty too.  Their women are strong and there is a sense of purpose to their lives - even if the purpose means loosing the life itself.  I had some issues with all the monsters in the movie.  I did not want to watch another ""Lord of the Ring"" movie. Xerxes was a brutal king, but portraying his army as a bunch of ugly looking monsters, was not something I could buy into easily.  The movie (and the actual historical event) is about fight for democracy and ideals at any cost, it is a lesson to humankind and its protagonists rightly so deserve their place in history.  But this was a fight about men against men, not men against monsters.  Spartans were outnumbered against Persian army, but they have willingly sacrificed their lives in order to spread awareness to the rest of the Greece and western world about the ideas worth dying for.

The picture and audio quality of this disc are on a par with the best I've seen to date in home video. On top of that, I think that Butler and Heady do a great job of conveying the Spartan image being defined by the writer.However, there are just a few too many enhanced blood-spatters and other graphical 'devices' for my taste.  This is understandable, given the original basis for the script, but I think that if it had been toned down just a bit, it would have been slightly more effective.  It is a great story and they had a solid cast to work with; less might have been more.	4.0	Great production, but.....	2007-09-14	0	0	0

It's everything that a mythology-based movie should be like. This movie will inevitably blow any other historical crap off the map.The movie begins with the history of King Leonidas. Ever since he was a child, he was exposed to such unusual cruelty. Now, he is a king, and is bringing an army of 300 Spartans against Persians. He climbs to a mountaintop, and finds a woman, who does a dance for him, and foretells that an army amongst them is ready to attack. Now, it's up to him and his army of 300 brave men.This is ultimately an epic story told on a SWEEPING scale. The visuals are cool, the cinematography is amazing, and the story is apocryphal with an ending with King Leonidas' self-sacrifice that had me hanging on the edge of my seat.Now I would NOT recommend this for the young ones, as it is INCREDIBLY violent and gory.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ANJECC80HOKTM	Reservoir Dog (Mr. Pink)	"For those of you who haven't seen this film, and want to know if the trip is worth it: The Answer is YES! The film is an amazing achievement for popcorn flicks, epics, and visual effects alike. The digital backdrops are worth the price of admission alone, and the battles have enough flying limbs and gore to make a butcher cringe. However, this film will only be enjoyable to a certain demographic. First of all, smaller children should NOT be attending this film. With the gore and nudity, this is not a family motion picture. Also, those looking for story over substance will be sorely dissapointed. This is an action film aimed at mixing amazing visuals with stunning fights. This is a great theatrical experience, and will not dissapoint if you know what to expect...The general story: The historical event this film is roughly based off of is the battle of thermopylae, but the film is more an adaption of the Frank Miller comic of the same name. Do not go into the movie expecting a historicaly accurate film. There are mutants, gods, and other mythical creatures from the comics! The name ""300"" refers to a group of 300 spartans who make a final stand against Xerxes and his massive Persian army.They defend Sparta while also holding off the Persians until Greece agrees to send their army. The film focuses around the soldiers in battle, and the political debates in Sparta regarding the war.If you enjoy epic action films like ""Gladiator"" or ""Lord of the Rings"", unique visual films like ""Sin City"" or the recent ""Fountain"", or just want a fun time with some friends, ""300"" will be the right choice for you. The acting(Gerard Butler as King Leonidas will make YOU want to run into a battle with nothing but a spear) and battles are intense, the score epic, and the effects jaw-dropping. This film is brilliant because it succeeds so well at what it tried to accomplish, and that is being a stylish action film.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3W13VVBRY5GL7	"Review Lover ""ReviewLover"""	"""300"" is a fantastical, romanticised look at Spartan King Leonidas' defence of his lands and liberties against the onslaught of invading Persian forces, led by Xerxes.And that, frankly, is just about all the plot you'll need before watching the movie.""300"" may well have been based on actual historical events, but it certainly isn't about historical accuracy. Not that it much matters once the film gets going: anyone levelling that particular criticism at this movie may well find that they protesteth too much, I doubt the actual history of the tale was this entertaining.The real stars of ""300"" are James D. Bissel (Production Design), Michael Wilkinson (Costumes) and Zack Snyder (Director). This is a really, really beautiful movie to watch, and as a piece of cinema, is infinitely more rewarding than ""Sin City"". It's more creative, more lush, and far more confident in its execution. The initial scenes start slowly, verging on boring - the CGI giant wolf looks like it belongs in an early Harry Potter flick - but once the battle scenes at Thermopylae begin in earnest, the incredible skill of Director Snyder at showcasing the beauty and artistry of Bissel's and Wilkinson's work kicks in, and ""300"" works best during these sumptuous, grisly battle sequences.There's a richness of texture and variety in during the battle sequences that is really unusual to see: filmed in a very monochromatic manner, it's an incredibly clever use of colour (much better, and far more subtle than in ""Sin City"") and light that keeps our eyes focused and our imagination caught. Also, the Harry Potterishness of the Wolf notwithstanding, the special effects are really excellent, and set a whole new standard with what can be accomplished outside of the totally computer-generated world. Artistically, ""300"" is top-drawer, all the way.On occasion, though, the lushness overextends itself, and certain scenes slip into mawkishness: Xerxes' Porta-throne ensemble sort of looks like something one would find onstage at a Cher concert, and the Ephors at the beginning of the movie are way too overstated in their makeup and direction. Similarly, the Oracle looks cheap and overdone - had these scenes been pared-back, they'd have found more success as devices with which to forward the plot - but as is, they simply pale in comparison to the frankly more interesting battle sequences.Which brings me neatly to the acting - there's not a whole lot going on. Once Leonidas and his men begin to fight, there's no more need for dialogue or interaction, so why writer Kurt Johnstadt chose to cut the action sequences with some (by comparison) very boring scenes involving Queen Gorgo and the Spartan council is beyond me. It's a cheap way of giving the audience a break from the battle sequences, but sadly, the break proves to be more tiresome than restful, and we're dying for these scenes of human interest to finish. There's not much of a chance for characterisation, either - it would appear that a lot of shouting and some tired one-liners pass for an indication of masculinity and brotherhood in ""300"" - but again, this forces the real reason for watching the picture - the fighting - into the background.I wouldn't have minded half as much if the script had been of a higher standard, but it's just not. ALSO, THERE IS A LOT OF SHOUTING! PERHAPS ANCIENT SPARTANS WERE VERY HARD OF HEARING, I DO NOT KNOW. Don't misunderstand - nobody here gives a bad performance, per se, there's just not enough onscreen non-battle time with which to create a character in ""300"", so the talents of Gerard Butler, Lena Heady and Rodrigo Santoro are left unexercised.I can't recommend ""300"" as a really great movie - it's a one-trick pony, and whenever it's excellent (the battle scenes), it shoots itself in the foot with some poor scripting and boring domestic and political sub-plots. Still, if you're a fan of action, you'll have a ball - I certainly did during those bits."	3.0	Aesthetically pleasing, somewhat flawed	2007-03-22	14	6	8

The action is slow. Too slow.. Slow motion only has it's limits, but I guess they wanted to push the CG in this movie. The story of 300 vs a vast army. Very violent and mythical in it's story told. I would suggest watching this.The two sides. I watched this on blu ray and was sorely disappointed. I guess they tried to make it old looking or something because there were black speckles all over it. In fact it made me sick, and dizzy to watch the quality all speckled. I expect super sharp quality. I have tested this with a different disk and different player. Same effect. Then I watched the DVD version at a buddies place. It looked great.

This was an interesting, if not entirely accurate, testosterone-loaded look at the Battle of Thermopylae, one of history's most lopsided and impressive battles, as 300 Spartan elite soldiers, supported by others, held back the Persian invasion forces for days, allowing Greece to prepare its greater forces to repel the invasion.

I think it is a decent movie if you like history/war movies and also comic book adaptations.  So, I am not going to pretend to sway your opinion on the quality of the story, just bit on the quality of the HD DVD.This is the only film besides Superman Returns that I have purchased on release for HD DVD (after owning a player for 1 year).  If you read the many Blu-Ray/HD DVD websites, animated films are rated well for picture quality since the source is usually digitally created.I viewed this on an HD DVD drive on an XBox 360 at 720p and 1080p on a Sony 60"" LCD projection TV.  The black hues are much better on the 1080p (maybe a reason to upgrade... or not).  There were few grainy images in the movie (you may possibly notice some edges between live actors and the backgrounds).  I also watched the DVD side in 480p just to compare.  The features on the HD DVD were more extensive, historical interviews, etc.  The image was much improved even using an Onkyo up converting to 1080i.  The sound effects are great on 7.1.I have to tweak my Onkyo setup a bit since the sound seemed to diminish on dialogue.  The battle scenes sounded top notch.  I would seriously consider getting the HD DVD version since it is only about $25 on Amazon.  This would be one of the few movies out there that the high def version is much improved over the DVD since part of the visual source is digital."	5.0	300: Great film on HD DVD	2007-08-08	3	2	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1LE79HKL5G9C6	Rob6965	300, the latest entry into the genre of futuristic films, is another adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novels. However, in stark contrast to Sin City, 300 does not contain any truly memorable performances or dialogue. Still, 300 accomplishes what Zach Snyder set out to do, and that is create a visual masterpiece. While 300 is dull in between fight scenes, those sequences are so exciting that they leave the viewer with an urge to throw a spear at someone.Gerard Butler gives a solid performance as King Leonidas, the man who leads 300 Spartans into battle against 250,000 Persians led by Xerxes, a king who fancies himself a god. However, Butler is the victim of poor writing, and most of his lines are cliched battle cries which at times are more amusing than inspiring. But no one is going to see 300 for the screenplay or plot. Snyder takes full advantage of this and, unlike other films that unintentionally focus on violence, Snyder deliberately bases the film on it, putting every kill in slow motion and having gallons of computer generated blood fill the screen.Overall, though 300 is simple, it accomplishes what it sets out to do, and is the most beautiful film (to look at, that is) I've ever seen. 300 is unabashedly violent, and takes advantage of the viewers' excitement during the battle sequences by making half of the film slow motion fight scenes. 300 is witty and exciting, one of the most enjoyable films of the 21st century, and makes 2 hours go by like 2 minutes.	3.0	We're In For One Wild Night	2007-03-24	9	3	6

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"300 (Zack Snyder, 2007)Dear Zack (may I call you Zack? Thank you.),Let me start off by saying that while I wasn't absolutely thrilled with the Dawn of the Dead remake, I did like it. So I was not one of those who greeted the news that you'd be directing the adaptation of Frank Miller's awe-inspiring graphic novel 300 with a groan. Then I started hearing ""frame-for-frame"", and I got even more excited. I figured we were in for something fantastic. And halfway through 300, I was wondering whether it would be ludicrous to proclaim a movie as the best of the year when there are still nine months of it left. Nine months or no, an hour into this movie, I knew I was in the presence of greatness.An hour later, I walked out of the theater more bitterly disappointed than I have been with a movie in recent memory. How did something so great become so bad so fast?Let's not let it be said that I don't give credit where credit is due. The majority of this movie is fantastic. Save Gerard Butler's overacting, of course, but I was prepared for that thanks to the trailers. And the parts where you stuck to the novel? Perfect. A lot of the ideas that were extended also worked. The overly-stylized violence that's got some folks in an uproar worked for me; after all, the idea of this battle is larger than life, and making the violence larger than life, as well, seemed an obvious choice. You probably could've saved yourself a million or two by not overusing the annoying bullet-time, but that's a minor quibble at best. When you kept the movie on the battlefield, it was great.The introduction of the ""meanwhile, back at the ranch..."" plot halfway through did seem as if it were going to work for a while; despite its consistent throwing off of the pace of the novel's final two chapters (the battle itself), the characters and the intrigue seemed to be consistent with what we'd seen before. You did, however, take it a bit too far in its climax. A bit? Okay, a lot. But that, too, is kind of minor. More important is the fact that the entire development-of-Stelios'-character subplot seems to have been sacrificed for this; without us seeing Stelios go from Stumblios the flunky on the first page of the book to Hero of Thermopylae, we find ourselves wondering why he was the guy who got all the glory. For being a wiseacre? Hardly, but that's the way it looks here. Again, though, minor.The first thing that really got to me was your treatment of Xerxes' immortals. (Fabulous voice effects on Xerxes, however.) Was it really necessary to use your extra makeup budget from Dawn of the Dead turning the immortals into non-humans, and thus sacrificing all the willing suspension of disbelief you'd worked up in your audience? Then came Ubermortal, and, well, you blew it. Hasn't watching the Sci-Fi Channel and Greg Dark movies taught you anything? Professional wrestlers do not belong in serious film. Especially when that film is based on something that really happened (unless, of course, it's a pro wrestler biopic).Then, hot on the heels of ""hey, let's throw in some demons!"", we cut to the big scene with Ephialtes. And... um... Baphomet himself playing a bloody lute? Where did that come from? I spent the rest of the night trying to figure out the answer to that question. I'm sure it does have an answer, and that answer in some way involves making the Persian hordes more evil than they actually are-- but man, let's take a look at the way that message fits in with everything else in that scene, and let's examine (a) the way Frank Miller equates sensuality with evil in the graphic novel-- where the only overt attack on sensuality is in the Ephors' Oracle, and that speaks to Leonidas' character more than anything, and (b) the way you equate sensuality with evil not only with the Oracle, but in the Ephialtes/Xerxes scene. (You do know that Baphomet is a symbol for knowledge, yes?) Given that, is there any particular reason that the end credits had to point out that three of the pleasure girls in that scene were transsexuals? Any particular reason for the lingering close-up of a girl-on-girl kiss? One might, upon reflection, find the scene almost reactionary. (One might also start considering these ludicrous claims equating Xerxes to George W. and Leonidas to, well, whoever's running Iraq these days as not so ludicrous.) That one scene did a great deal to blow the movie for me. It's what had me so mad when the movie was over. But that wasn't the movie's greatest crime.It's what you did to Leonidas (whose name, by the way, seems like it should have been pronounced with the ""i"" sounding like ""machine"" and not ""Tiber""-- but I took Latin, not Greek, and thus might be wrong) that has me thinking you should be strung up in the public square and caned.I'll pause here long enough to note the attack-on-sensuality theme coupled with the injection of a scene of Leonidas and Gorgo making love, smile a bit sadly, and move on. Other than that one scene (which didn't bug me in the least when I first saw it, despite it being the first major deviation from the original text-- of course, I had no idea what you were setting us up for later at the time), as I've mentioned before, the first half of the movie conforms amazingly well to the first six chapters of the novel. And one of the things those first six chapters do is pound the fact into our heads, over and over again, that Spartans have achieved their legendary military might because they're hard. They're not koalas. They know what to do with their sharp claws! You even keep in that bit of Dilios' voiceover after Gorgo delivers one of my favorite lines in the novel: ""Spartan! Come back with your shield... or on it."" Dilios goes out of his way to tell us that there's no room for softness there. And you went out of your way to keep that line. The whole ""here, take my necklace bit"" seemed to kind of undermine it, but again, that seemed-- at the time, anyway-- a minor change.And we merrily go on our way for a while, and everyone fights, and blood flies, and the Spartans build the wall, and we get to the climax, and Leonidas... folds like a cheap roadmap. He might as well have been the romantic lead in a Nora Ephron movie. What was up with that? I've heard people complain a lot about ""gratuitous"" sex and ""gratuitous"" violence in movies. Well, here's one for you-- gratuitous sentimentality! What were you thinking? You spend an hour of film setting up the idea that Spartans are not koalas. You spend another forty minutes or so showing us that Spartans are not koalas. And then you give us the big climax and the King of the Spartans turns into a little tree-climer.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A23VTC6VKNFZVE	Robert D. Williams	This heavy duty action film is based upon a true story.  Sometime around 465 BC, the Persians, under the rule of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) mounts an invasion force into the Greek homeland.  He leads an army reputed to have more than a million soldiers to the Hot Gates at Thermopylae.  King Leonidas (Gerald Butler) is onto their game and leads a party of 300 Spartans and 1000 Arcadian allies to intercept them.  But all is not well at home either.  As a plot is hatched to put Leonidas in disfavor with the senators and abuse his wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey).  Thereby leaving Leonidas without any badly needed reinforcements.Meanwhile Leonidas has his hands full at the Hot Gates.  Xerxes throws everything he has at them, including The Immortals, his most powerful warriors.  But the gates are so narrow, they cannot push past.  A deformed traitor proves to be his undoing though, and shows Xerxes a way around the pass and behind Leonidas.  It is interesting here that the very kind of deformed imperfect people the Spartans try to rid themselves of, causes their downfall.The Spartans revere physical fitness above all and are said in battle to come home with their shields or upon them.  The actors here in 300 are all very buff, especially having great abs.  After watching the movie, I tried to achieve the same effect and failed miserably.Director Larry Fong did an admirable job filming this great semi historical epic story.  It's films like this that can bring history to a life never achieved or imagined from reading a dull dry history book.  In fact, to some of the more intense viewers, it's like being there as a participant yourself. Nearly 2500 years have passed but what was done there that day is still remembered.	5.0	THE ULTIMATE WORKOUT VIDEO	2013-06-13	0	0	0

The good men and woman of theatre are in line around the block to sign a petition demanding the exile from the creative arts of the sanitation engineers and deli owners and bus drivers (not meaning any explicit defamation of the above, but deli owners should stick to salami) as well as the dentists who financed this monstrosity.The chowder-headedness of the writers anoints them as master fisherman of the Grand banks.  Up in their nets came a central character so vapid, so dull, so unimaginative (the hunky Leonidas)  he can't imagine himself as either the rescuer or the plunderer of the pulchritudinous oracle held captive by the grotesque ephors - unless we see their deformity as a projection of his own jealousy for the sexual license they have granted themselves.No, to make this movie come right one would need to focus it on Ephialtes, the terribly deformed ex-Spartan who yearns for a impossible social approval any man in his right mind who be too proud to want. (Internal Conflict #1).  And on the friction between his need to be approved of by Persians and a proposed, rather vaporous loyalty to a crew that could not ever want him (Internal Conflict #2).Well, it could be worse.  The folks who struggled over that other grand miscarriage, the Pirates of the Caribbean series probably realized (because most writers are college graduates) the mainspring of the story was the romance between Calypso and Davy Jones and how it explains a part of the dynamic in any romance between power and rejection - yet they burned their talent at the altar of special effects.  Ah, the compromises we make.Am I the only person who thought Keira Knightly's face looks a little bland when magnified to the height of a movie screen.

He wanted to get to the essence of the Spartans, and to show us the story of a handful of soldiers willing to risk all for a larger western concept of freedom and liberty...""300"" is an interpretation of a complex historical event, the collision of cultures that continues to this day... Spartan warriors and Persian soldiers were probably the most extreme cultures of that moment...They were interesting elements of truth in Zinder's movie: The Spartans were not like the Athenians... They lived under more barbaric rules... Every Spartan was a soldier... They fight as a specialized unit (""That's the source of our strength!""). Once they get this right group of iron, brass and muscles they become almost undefeatable (""Today no Spartans die!"").If you're a Spartan citizen you're a soldier (""Spartans! What is your profession?""), you're a pure warrior struggling for justice and for what you believe is true... The Spartans remain a mystery to everybody... They were, probably, unique... Till the day of the clash, they have never met an adversary who could offer them what they call 'a beautiful death.' They only were hoping with all the massive army gathered against them, there might be one down there who's up to the task (""Spartans! Ready your breakfast and eat hearty... For tonight, we dine in hell!"").Both the Spartans and Samurai warriors were comparably fierce and passionate (""No prisoners! No mercy!"")... They were raging soldiers (""Give them nothing but take from them everything!"")... But at the same time they had an absolute code of honor on the essence of being a Spartan... And it's cruel, very cruel... When a boy was born, he was inspected... If he's been sick or deformed, the child is murdered... From the time he could stand, he was taught not to retreat, never to surrender... He was taught that death on the battlefield in service to Sparta was the greatest glory he could achieve in his life... At the age of seven, all the boys were taken away from their mothers and plunged into a world of violence, turning them into growing men, ultimate warriors the world has ever known...King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) was a legendary hero, somebody special... His name was the descendant of lions... He was very powerful, very thoughtful and perhaps in the film far more human than he is even in the graphic novel... Leonidas was a practical man whose life is matched by a straight road to one gleaming moment in destiny and that day, he couldn't meekly swallow the insult of Sparta's submission to the world of Xerxes... ""This is Sparta!,"" as he shouted to Xerxes' emissary, affirming that there is no softness, no place for weakness, and only the hard and strong may call themselves Spartans...What I loved about Leonidas was his needs, in his moment of indecision, of a back-up, maybe a second opinion, some assurance of his wife Queen Gorgo... So we see him, both times, looking to his wife...Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) was a great character not only in the film but in history... She was sexy and beautiful and above all tough and aggressive... There was intensity, elegance and ability in her... Also a kind of femininity in her nobility... There's only one moment when she loses it at the end and it was not a breakdown...We know lot of Queen Gorgo thanks to Herodotus, the father of the history, who chooses to write about her which clearly demonstrate she was significant... Spartan women were special anyway, they were incredibly beautiful and Sparta was the land of beautiful women... They were beautiful because they were physically fit, because they were allowed to exercise... They were not repressed and were considered incredibly potent... Gorgo could speak among men because as she affirmed it before the Persian emissary: ""Only Spartan women give birth to real men!""Gorgo's one love scene with Leonidas and the dialogue beforehand, was powerful: ""It is not a question of what a Spartan citizen SHOULD do nor a husband, nor a king. Instead ask yourself, my dearest love, what should a free man do?""Brutally violent and completely faithful to Miller's work, Zinder's ""300"" is inspiring, brave, and bloody artistic film..."	4.0	"""Spartan!

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3VEY6WHYDIMAL	Robert Watson	300 is so stupid it almost makes a great comedy.  But it's too bloody and too boring to be a comedy.  It's merely a travesty.  First, all this talk of Spartan freedom is absurd.  A very large majority ( about 80 or 90 percent ) were slaves.  I don't expect this film to dwell on slavery, but it might at least be mentioned, especially since the so-called free Spartans had long since sacrificed their freedom to the preservation of slavery.  Sparta, in fact, was a military state precisely because it feared its slaves.  Men were valued only as soldiers, and women were valued only as breeders to bring more soldiers and breeders into Sparta's mindless military machine.  So why all this talk of freedom?  There was no freedom in Sparta.  Yes, the defeat of the Persians was an important battle that allowed Greek democracy ( however limited ) to flourish.  But that democracy flourished in Athens and other Greek city states, and no in Sparta.  The Athenians used to claim that there was no heroism in Sparta.  Spartans had nothing to live for, and therefore death could mean little to them.But putting aside stupidity for a moment, the film doesn't work anyway.  A great emphasis in placed on the Spartan phalanx in which one soldier protects the next in creating an impenetrable wall, which the Persians, even with their great numbers, will not be able to breach in the narrow pass.  A for two minutes, the Spartans wisely use this phalanx.  But I guess that would have been too boring for a movie, so the Spartans soon resort to hand to hand combat where the Persians superior numbers should have been able to easily overwhelm the Spartans.  But since this a very stupid movie, every Spartan kills a hundred or more Persians in hand to hand combat.  Just incredibly stupid.  And even if you can overlook such stupidity, the fighting is often cartoonish.One of the worst movies I've ever seen.	1.0	An Awful Movie	2014-05-20	2	0	2

Wolves don't look like they do in the movie, nor are elephants 50 feet tall at the shoulder, nor do armies of men have monster faces or grow into ogreish, sharp-teethed growling humanoids.  Also, Xerxes, the Persian King, wasn't 8 feet tall with a deep, resonant, godlike voice.  If you were there and somehow could have witnessed what it looked like, it wouldn't have looked like this.However, having said all of this, it's a thoroughly enjoyable and visually engaging testosterone flick.  I'm not ruling out that some women may enjoy this, but more men than women will.  This is not a film for children.  I give it four stars for keeping me unable to take my eyes from the screen for the whole film and for being a generally "" cool "" movie.

Easily one of the most pretencious and grossly inaccurate film on any historical event ever conceived!  From the costumes of the Spartans down to the Middle Earth looking army of the Persians this is total and complete fantasy.As a comic book for teens and adults that have never grown out of that genre I suppose it may have some value, but to regard this as any kind of serious history is truly mistaken.  Most people seem to be impressed by all the PC graphics used for this distorted epic.  Is this how we judge the quality of films now?  By their high-tech gimmicks?  Where is a decent storyline, some attention to the actual events, etc.  If this is where we are going with quasi-historical epics I certainly won't be going to the movies much anymore.If the reader is seeking a film that pays some attention to the actual events I recommend the 1962 ""300 Spartans"".  While a classic sword and sandal flick, at least it does not have Xerses as some over-blown drag-queen!  The Persians look as they should, and you don't have all these mutants and ugly wretches floating aronnd onscreen.  Why is this kind of thing approved of now?

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"I guess it's true that everything old is eventually new again.In the early days of moviemaking - thanks primarily to budgetary constraints and the logistical difficulties brought about by having to work with primitive and cumbersome camera and sound equipment - directors rarely ventured outdoors to film even their most epic-type adventures.  Instead, they were forced to do most of their filming on a soundstage, shooting their actors in front of a painted backdrop or - when it became available - a more technologically advanced ""blue screen,"" which allowed them to add an array of previously impossible special effects to the picture as well.  Then, in the 1950`s and 1960`s, facing stiff competition from a burgeoning new medium known as television, filmmakers turned to ""on-location"" shooting as a means of both increasing the realism of their pictures and drawing people back to the theaters.  This was seen as a great leap forward for the movies both as an art form and as a business.Now, in 2007, it would appear that Hollywood has indeed come full circle with ""300,"" a rousing sword-and-sandal epic that has been filmed entirely in a studio, using only CGI effects to recreate the movie's ancient Mediterranean setting.  Ironically, this is being hailed as a great ""innovation"" by the very youngsters who would be yelling ""That looks so fake"" at all the similar themed movies from the 1930's and 1940's.  Go figure.If ""300"" has the look and feel of a comic book or video game, that is clearly no accident, for it comes from the highly acclaimed graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley.  The story is based on the Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in 480 B.C. between the Persians, with a fighting force estimated at between 60,000 to 300,000 soldiers, and the Spartans, with a force of a mere 300 (plus around 700 Thespian volunteers).  The Spartans, trained from childhood to be professional fighters, ended up losing the battle but not before inflicting heavy losses on the Persian army and becoming a symbol and a source of inspiration for all those unafraid to march into battle despite tremendous odds against them.If it weren't for its unique look, there wouldn't be much to distinguish ""300"" from a hundred other action films.  The characters are wafer-thin and stereotypical, and the movie evinces a kind of xenophobia that is more than a trifle disconcerting in a world in which relations between the East and West are none too friendly to begin with.  All the Spartans, including their leader, King Leonidas, are light-skinned, noble warriors, while the Persians are dark-skinned, ignoble barbarians, whose general, King Xerxes, comes across as a lisping, mincing, make-up-wearing drag queen.  The dialogue and narration, provided by Kurt Johnstad, Michael Gordon, and director Zack Snyder, is invariably cheesy, corny and insufferably self-important, while the actors, Gerald Butler, Rodrigo Santoro and Lena Headey, pretty much fade into the obscurity of the computer-generated background.But trying to evaluate ""300"" apart from its visuals would be as meaningless as judging ""Jurassic Park"" without its dinosaurs.  For the look of the picture is what ""300"" is clearly all about, and on that level, the movie succeeds spectacularly.  The sepia-toned images of roiling land- and sky-scapes, massing armies and storm-tossed oceans are indeed something to behold and give the film an otherworldly quality that goes a long way towards mitigating the weaknesses in the acting and writing.  Even the ultra-violent, blood-soaked battle scenes, though a trifle redundant after awhile, take on a legendary quality thanks to the unreal aura of the scene.""300"" is an interesting enough experience as a one-time thing, but I hope it doesn't signal a long term trend in moviemaking.

Those who suggest that it distorts history or represents myth just don't get it. Frank Miller was very explicit that the graphic novel is exagerated and allegorical.He didn't spell it out for us, but a little thinking should lead to understanding. Persia is the same place geographically as as today's Iran and Iraq. The Persian attack on Greece, the cradle of Western civilization, parallels the Jihadists' attack on Western society and culture. In the book Miller constantly reiterates that the battleis one of democracy, freedom and justice against oriental tyranny,sensuality and slavery. The analogies should be obvious. Despite the fact that Western media pundits pretended not to get it, Iran certainly did, condemning the film in no uncertain terms, even creating a website to counter it.

It may be more engaging to those who enjoy comic books but those who enjoy adult fare will like Troy far better.Those who know little of Spartan society and the Battle of Thermopolae may enjoy this cartoon.  Those more familiar with the austere Spartan way of life and the motives and conduct of the battle at the Gates of Fire, will be far less well served.  This movie takes incredible liberties with the battle against the Persians.  First...Leonidas never visited ancient and deformed seers who had been bought off by the Persians.  Leonidas, a very religious man, realizing that he was facing a life-and-death battle visited the Pythia who...as was her way...gave him an ambivalent answer.  ""A King must die,""  she prophesied.  Leonidas, King of Sparta, reckoned the King was him and determined to go out in real style.Second...the Spartans were HEAVY infantry.  They would NOT have been fighting bare-chested.  Every man of them would have been wearing heavy breastplates and greaves for his thighs and shins.  Initially ""the 300"" got it right by showing a battle that was as more of a pushing match than a sword fight.  Then, in fine Hollywood fashion, the battle breaks up into individual antagonists.  It didn't happen that way.  If the Spartans had fought bare-chested and man-to-man, they would have been annihiliated in less than a half hour.  The fact that they last three days is a testimony to group cohesion and discipline.Third...Xerxes wasn't 7.5 feet tall...ridiculous.  Fourth...the Persians used no rhinos and elephants...Xerxes was no Hannibal.  Fifth...why do the ignorant [let me promise you, they are plenty ignorant of history and drama] Hollywood types have to mess with history?

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3TX4D1J1DLKVK	"Ron Griffis ""Ron"""	"Sparta, Lacedaemonian city state in the southern Greek peninsula. The year was 480 B.C.  It was the Classical age... a savage age... a golden age. An age when men were Real Men, women were Real Women, and politicians were vile, lascivious, treacherous, narcissistic... OK, so the politicians haven't changed much.The movie ""300"" is an adaptation of comic artist Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name. It tells the story, albeit in a fanciful way, of one of the greatest battles in history. The Battle of Thermopylae is taught in nearly every military academy and military history class in the world for both its military and its moral virtues. On the one hand, it is an excellent example of the benefits of training and discipline, and of the excellent tactical use of terrain. On the other hand, it is a shining example of dedication and sacrifice, of free men volunteering to give their lives to protect their homeland, their people, and their way of life.At the Battle of Thermopylae (greek for Hot Gates, because of the tight passages and hot springs), 300 Spartans, including the Spartan King Leonidas, and a few thousand other Greek soldiers fought the invading army of the Persian emperor Xerxes, which some estimates put at over two million strong. By the third day of battle, most of the other Greeks withdrew and only the Spartans and a few hundred others remained. The Spartans died to the last man to give the other Greek city states time to mount defenses strong enough to hold against the remainder of Xerxes' army.The Greek poet Simonides of Ceos (556 BC-469 BC) engraved an epitaph for the 300 Spartans on a stone at the site of the battle. It reads ""Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here, obedient to their laws, we lie."" This passage is considered by scholars to be among the noblest phrases ever uttered by man. It does not ask for glory or accolades, only that they be remembered as soldiers who did their duty.The movie ""300"" is not the most historically accurate depiction of this famous battle. There were no elephants or rhinoceroses at Thermopylae. The movie's Xerxes looks like a Goa'uld from Stargate SG1, whereas the real Xerxes was more likely closer to Usama Bin Laden in appearance. Many other details were exaggerated and fantastical. However, the movie does get right the central points of sacrifice, heroism, honor, and love of freedom. The Spartans may have been brutal by today's standards, but they were free people living in a brutal world.Also, many famous moments and phrases chronicled by historians, like ""(Persian) arrows will blot out the Sun"", ""Then we shall fight in the shade"", ""Come and get them!"", and the ""Go tell the Spartans..."" epigram are faithfully included.  Besides, the exaggerations and fantasy would have pleased the ancient Greeks who often idealized their heroes in plays, art, and literature.The combination of history, heroism, and fantasy makes this movie a wild ride and a must-see."	5.0	Go tell the Spartans!	2008-03-17	1	0	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AAOF195P95ZVC	Ross E. Nelson	"Remember, this is a movie made from a comic book.  Keep that in mind and it all goes down a lot easier.  It's full of complete claptrap about ""liberty"" and ""rights,"" about which Sparta knew practically nothing.  The cruelty and tyranny of Sparta are only barely hinted at.  Judging from the beefcake, however, it's clear that that martial city had some mighty Olympian weightlifting gyms.There's blood and gore aplenty as the Spartans lay repeated [...]-whuppin's on the invading Persians.  But the comic book imitation made it all look a little unreal and thus much less shocking than other modern sword-and-toga movies.  The sepia tones, the monsters, and the extraordinarily indestructible (until the end) Spartans made it hard to take all of this seriously.  Some of the cornpone dialogue was unintentionally funny too.  In true Hollywood fashion, the hero soldiers in 300 inflict huge damage on the enemy while taking only light losses themselves, dealing with elephants, vast armies, monsters, and thunderstorms of arrows with competence and aplomb.  Yet in the final battle, when it's time to wrap things up, they're massacred in just moments.Of course, there's betrayal of the Spartans both by a grotesque hunchback and by a politician in Sparta.  The latter was incredibly stupid enough to be carrying around gobs of Persian gold coins he'd been bought off with, sealing his doom as a traitor and as a first class moron.There were some great moments in 300.  Xerxes, the Persian god-king, was fascinatingly portrayed as a bejeweled, beringed giant.  Totally unhistorical but a total hoot. His conveyance was pure inspiration too. The clouds of arrows were creepily impressive. A couple of scenes were ripped off from Lord of the Rings and Gladiator, but they still worked.The battle at Thermopylae is one of the western world's marvels.  With a handful of men the Spartans stymied for the time being a vast Persian army.  It's a great story.  The nudity and gore fully justify the R rating. If you watch the movie as nothing more than a very loosely based, vivid comic book rendering of one of history's great battles, and can put up with the frequent slo-mo scenes, you might get a kick out of it."	3.0	Come and Get Them	2007-08-22	3	1	2

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3VNYMNK7OC7CM	R. Sardrena	"Based on a Frank Miller comic book (graphic novel? Come on.), 300 is a gory depiction of the Battle of Thermopylae, where 300 Spartans held a narrow pass against a huge Persian army until eventually being annihilated.  Their doomed stand against incredible odds has been told countless times as an example of heroism.  On another level, the tale is often retold when Westerners are rallied to hate Eastern ""hordes."" The battle has often been disquieting to Western listeners because it extolls the heroism of the Spartans - a people who lived for little more than combat, and who almost constantly sparred with the revered Athenians. With its combination of militarism and anti-Easternism, this tale's time for retelling has come. 300 lauds the Spartan ""warrior ethic"" without irony, lovingly depicting the progression of children into efficient killers (a good wolf-impaling earns them an Eagle scout badge), and sneering at Athenians as ""...philosophers and boy-lovers."" Paradoxically, it claims that the Spartans were the ancient upholders of ""freedom"" against Persian oppression. Decapitations and spritzes of blood are shown in slow-motion again and again to a snappy rock beat. It could be a good modern ""Triumph of the Will"" - it only needs an ""I Want You!"" recruiting poster after the scrolling credits to be complete."	2.0	"Ancient history as ""Dunces With Wolves"""	2007-12-09	7	4	3

The movie, directed by Zack Snyder and employing a visual look inspired by Peter Jackson and graphic artist  Frank Miller, is a phenomenon. Like ""The Matrix"" - which is far superior - it recalibrates Hollywood.Sure, comic book movies have scored since the original ""Superman."" But ""300"" doesn't have a minted pedigree. No iconic heroes. And no titanic actors in it. The cloth from which it's cut might be absurd and remarkably unaware, but it's immensely attractive.Snyder and Co. splash every color of blood puddin' they could find on the screen, and the result, to me, is nothing less than right-wing propaganda. Maybe even Nazi propaganda. It's certainly Ayn Rand's wet dream.Hyperbole? Nope. Just ""300.""It opens on a piles of skulls beneath a cliff. A narrator tells us those are the miniature skulls of babies tossed to their death for any physical imperfection. Fortunately for baby Leonidas, who will one day be king of Sparta, he is without flaw, and is spared from murder.His physical perfection especially helps when he is trained to kill and thrown into the wilderness at 7. Later, when Leonidas leads his titular men against the giant Persian army  in the name of freedom, we must remember the ""liberty"" for which he fights is really the tyranny of the pure.It's the Spartan, who embraces a beautiful death, against the defiled, deranged Persian, who toils as a slave. The leader of the Persian army is Xerxes, an eight-foot cross of Gandhi and belly dancer. Most of his soldiers resemble Orcs. Some are magicians. A couple are deformed monsters At one point, frustrated, they simply use their lone rhinoceros against this band of sculpted, sepia-toned Greek gods.It's arrogant and faithless to presume audiences will set aside the substance of the Spartans -they're unlikable, smarmy, racist and homophobic and firmly reject the idea of diplomacy - to embrace the movie's dramatic images. Breathtaking as they might be, they remain in celebration of something our conscience rejects. To demand the film remains in the vacuum of entertainment reduces the viewer to Alex in ""A Clockwork Orange.""And the final act of ""300"" feels like a cross between an MTV video and a high schooler's poorly penned allegory that he turns into the creative writing teacher after sealing the document with a tear of integrity, solemnly closed eyes and a symbolic kiss. It's total cheese and out of character with what we know of Leonidas throughout the movie.It amounts to a beefcake weepier. Goofy, Harlequin-style idolatry. Of course it's absurd, but it doesn't mean it's not a little irresponsible when it eventually reduces every female character to a set of breasts and flowing locks. It doesn't mean we have to let it off the hook.We may want to disassociate meaning from images, to turn them into a mechanical series of ones of zeroes, but we can't, and we don't, so embracing ""300"" for being cool is akin to embracing ""Birth of a Nation"" for its revolutionary filmmaking while it tacitly supported the Ku Klux Klan.

But here come the Persians anyway.  After told by the wise men and the Oracle (consisting of lepers and a drunken adolescent girl) that there would be no war, the King of Sparta ""takes a walk"" with 300 of his finest warriors ""as bodyguards"".  They head north, to where the Persian army approaches.  A battle ensues, 300 men against an army of tens of thousands.  This is the plot.This is why it doesn't work.  While visually appealing, there's nothing else left to hold up the movie; no script or direction or acting.  The film is overloaded with unnecessary slow motion action scenes.  This allows for adequate display of the eye candy (the main reason for the movie).  Lots of muscle men running around in loincloths, and scantily clad women romping in Xerxes little parlor of sin.  '300' could easily take over the movie 'Spartacus' as the chosen film for parlor entertainment of the visually appealing kind.If the Spartans were Greek, why did I keep detecting a bit of Scottish accents there?  Why wasn't Sean Connery invited along?  There were too many unnecessary buffalo shots.  The timeline was ruined by modern style facial piercings and inappropriately added modern music into an otherwise non-modern soundtrack.  Even the actors who have proven themselves in other roles, such as Dominick West, all seemed to have taken acting lessons from William Shatner to give their performances in this film.  Some of the scenes have the surreal feel of a Calvin Kline add.The only way to watch this movie is with the sound off and some good music on the stereo.  A little weed wouldn't hurt either.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3U6WGSBAECZAF	"!Scipio Africanus, Vanquisher of Hannibal ""Th..."	"Historically, 300 is all about the last stand of Spartan King Leonidas and his personal bodyguard of 300 soldiers as they protect the strategic pass of Thermopylae--the only mainland entry into Greece from the viewpoint of the Persian Empire--from an invading force of Persians under Xerxes I. Visually and artistically, 300 is second-to-none and beautifies the art of killing and of war, at least to the extent that it looks like eye-candy. Ideologically and culturally, however, 300 can be construed as both a metaphor of today's War on Terror and a celebration or at least study of conservative, traditional values of nationalism, discipline and principled idealism. Despite all this potential, a great deal of 300 is actually factually inaccurate, campy, absurd and melodramatic.300's a film that has many pros for its many cons. To prioritize, I'll start with the most clear-cut: its aesthetic value as it relates to what you see. The main selling point of attraction is not the story, the gore, the actors, the graphic novel-based material, the killing, etc.. Above all else, it's the visual treat that 300 is from start to finish. This movie redefines the concept of aesthetics by being psychologically enjoyable to take in. Unless you're blind, it will keep your eyeballs glued to the TV screen with each increasing shot of bedazzlement. Whether it's the slow-motion scenes of slaughter or combat  (beheadings, hailstorms of incoming arrows, spear thrusts); the rendering of the stark, coastal terrain near which the battle takes place; or the costume design of the Greeks and Persians--300 is the epitome of visual beauty on film.Some scenes that are simply breathtaking on the right HDTV-and-DVD-combo are:-The young, Spartan boy shown battling a 3-D rendered wolf-The first clash between the 300 and the oncoming Persians-The hailstorm of arrows fired by the Persians with the 300 ducking beneath their shields-Leonidas fighting and then killing the Giant-A young, Spartan warrior successfully launching a spear which cripples and kills a charging, rhino-like monster from the Persian side-The Persian elephants pushed off a cliff by the GreeksThe point I was making is it's a very pretty film; did you get that? Good, because that smoothly segues into my next, complimentary argument: 300 is a film that has to be viewed on an HDTV of some, considerable size (42 inches and up) and power (true HD like 1080p). With this single-minded emphasis on style, you're hurting yourself if you don't watch it on a TV which has the specs to exploit the visual *rgy that 300 is.To that end, I tell anyone who'll listen that 300 could've excluded ALL the pithy and corny dialogue and just focused on showing scene after scene after scene of slaughter and fighting...and been a better film because of it. The fighting scenes are all that matter in 300 due to their graphical wizardry, and the sometimes dumb-as-a-doorknob dialogue really lowers the pleasure of 300 in some parts!!!!For instance, the ""writing"" (if you can call it that!) of the dialogue is so awkward that it's unintentionally hilarious. The dilemma with the dialogue is it's questionably broken up into boisterous monologues after each battle sequence or plot development, like a Shakespearean play. I.e., after the Spartans build a ""Wall of the Persian Dead"" during a lull in the fight, Xerxes I and Leonidas ""exchange"" dialogue, but it comes across more like the stilted and swollen delivery of self-righteous actors, who cannot act, in some crappy, off-Broadway theater-show. Similarly, after Leonidas and his men have been vanquished, the movie ends with the one-eyed Aristodemus leading the charge of a crack-squad of newly allied Greeks; the ""speech"" he gives to motivate his men is absurdly contrived like the BS one would expect in WWE wrasslin!!!!The flaws worsen as the exorbitant quantity of historical violations becomes UNFORGIVABLE!!!! These idiot, revisionist films from lib Hollywood are always mismanaged if they draw from historical material; it's become a fun game for me to watch these films just so I can count and then expose each, historical inaccuracy in their films. I don't have the 700 or so pages I require to list the historical flaws in 300, so I'll just give a small sampling of what I discovered:1.  The number of Greeks defending Thermopylae was actually 2300: the 300 Spartans but also 700 Thespian volunteers, 400 Thebans and 900 Helots!!!!2.  300 shows the Greek soldiers (called Hoplites, by the way [sidenote: there's a sophisticated and all-around awesome reviewer haunting Amazon by the name of The Hoplite Phalanx Fighting Formation; you're EXTREMELY lucky if you get a shot at reading his reviews]) fighting OUT OF their Phalanx Formation! This is sacrilege as they would've lost the battle had this occurred! Educated viewers know that the only reason Leonidas had so much success against Persia was precisely due to this Phalanx Formation which slaughtered Persians in this narrow space!!!!3.  Leonidas' Spartans would've fought using the Macedonian Sarissa, the long pike 300 clumsily shows the Greeks using. However, many fr*udulent scenes show the Greeks impotently fighting using poles that are MUCH shorter than the average, 17 foot length of such a weapon!!!!4.  There were absolutely ZERO elephants used at Thermopylae; the dumba*s makers of 300 egregiously confused Thermopylae with the Carthaginian trait of using elephants in some of their battles.5.  Xerxes I DID NOT, historical records will validate me, under any circumstances look like a San Francisco-styled, cross-dressing, transgendered S&M; practitioner, who looked like he would be marching in a g*y pride parade!!!! Records show that Xerxes I would've actually sported a beard, braids and robes.Another wrongdoing that's so faulty is how 300 panders to an immature, testosterone-infested, teen-male audience; it does this in part by exploiting unknown actress Lena Headey. Let me tell you, my social-conservative sensitivities were totally ransacked here. At about the 20-minute mark or so, Headey is shown topless, simulating sex with Gerard Butler. She's either such a shallow woman or depravedly finds it an ""honor"" to flash her bre*sts that one shot flagrantly just shows her bre*sts kind of flapping in slow-motion!!!! This was so blatantly pandering to the teen audience of males, who probably popped collective chubbies while watching this the first time!!!! I say that Headey could've used major bre*st-implant surgery as she failed to be attractive enough on the merits of her chest alone. In fact, I award her Nero Demerits and rate her a 3 for her SAGGING efforts!!!!I sprung for the two-disc version, which got me the ""bonus"" disc with behind-the-scenes features--because I like to be taken for a ride by the studios' cheap misconception of what constitutes worthwhile, ""bonus"" items. One of the features has the censurable Frank Miller impudently defending his historical revisionism and corruption of the Battle of Thermopylae!!!! For instance, throughout his little feature, Miller relentlessly admits to not accurately representing the facts surrounding Thermopylae or even Spartan culture, yet he downplays it as his right to do because he's allegedly just an ""artist"" ""re-imagining"" something historical...BS! I castigate Miller and all those who'd defend his corruption of history because if he was using source material for his 300 graphic novel, then he had a duty to reliably reproduce historical facts, or else come across as an intellectually lazy and sloppy revisionist...which he is.300's biggest, redeeming quality is in its ideology, where there are parallels for our western way of life in the present. The Battle of Thermopylae symbolizes today's War on Terror. Back then, Greek conservatives (Spartans) stood up for the principle of freedom and the preservation of the western way of life in the face of the eastern expansionism and aggressive instigation by the Persians. Today, American conservatives (GOP) are mostly leading the charge to defend the principle of freedom and the American way of life in the face of the radical Muslim expansionism that also is the instigator!!!! And this despite the stubbornly perverse, Democrat effort to thwart tough, anti-terror measures...kind of like the film's Ephors and the Spartan governing council, both of whom resist Leonidas' insistence on self-defense. Whoa--the parallels are just breathtaking!"	3.0	THIS...IS...SPARTA...BEY*TCH!!!! [Profanity MINE]	2008-04-22	9	6	3

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"Zach Snyder's ""300,"" an adaptation of Frank Miller's glorious graphic novel, tells the famous tale of the battle of the Spartans against the Persians at Thermopylae.  This is not a historically-accurate rendering of the battle, but a highly artistic, surprisingly refined imagining of one of Western civilization's most cherished stories.Virtually everyone knows the tale of the 300 Spartans, who stayed at the Gates of Fire to battle the Persian horde even though their death was assured. Even today you can see the stone memorial chiseled in their honor, with the Spartan King Leondidas' epitaph still legible.  Gerard Butler heads a strong cast - dominated by men, naturally - in this wild movie.  Flashing pecs and abs of steel, Butler personifies Leonidas - martial dignity incarnate.  Indeed, the poster for this movie gives away its a-historical bent - the Spartan warrior was a bronze-clad tank, not a whirling dervish of destruction.But who watches a movie like ""300"" for historical accuracy?  Nobody with a brain, that's for sure.  This is a pure entertainment.  Ang Lee, in his commentary to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" remarks that martial arts movies are like musicals, only instead of breaking into song, the actors beat each other up.  ""300"" is that type of movie.  The violence, while extreme and graphic, is poetic.  The Spartans wage war with their souls, and ""300"" captures that martial spirit.A heavy-metal soundtrack may seem anachronistic, and a political sub-plot somewhat tacked on, but ""300"" remains a thrilling, chilling, mesmerizing movie that goes into the recordbooks as one of the top 10 action movies ever made.Check it out."	5.0	A-historical epic brings the bloody goods	2008-01-28	1	0	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A13UAIE3K517CQ	sft	300 is an effects extravaganza, with a visual tone reminiscent of Sin City -- another successful Frank Miller graphic novel adaptation. The production design is to be applauded on all counts as this film looks remarkable throughout. It suffers, however, from some truly portentous dialogue (although, in fairness, it's hard to imagine the conversations that took place between such people during such times). It also borders on gratuitous in its depiction of violence, with arguably too frequent use of slow-motion during the gorier moments. Most notable however, is the oddly depressive and oppressive feel to this movie. Perhaps it's because of the unrelenting grimness, or maybe it's just me. This is powerful stuff in many ways but it's not particularly enjoyable to watch. I'd give it 5 stars if the visual aspect was all that mattered but the sheer severity of the viewing experience left me a little too dispirited for top marks.	3.0	Spartan viewing	2010-01-04	3	3	0

I would think the Oracle's original prophecy that a Spartan prince must die or Sparta will burn, would have added to the dramaticism of this movie. According to the legend Leonidas went to the battle of Thermopylae with the intention of fighting to the death from the very beginning. Also, according to history, the third day of battle even when the Spartans were surrounded, lasted for hours! I would have liked to have seen a bigger final battle scene, but alas, this version works just as well.	5.0	A new action instant classic	2007-07-31	2	2	0
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2VRNYXRLSWQSX	Sigrid Simms	Young men loved this and made it a blockbuster mainly for the special effects and the blood & guts. OKMature men loved it for the traditional &#34;male&#34; things of honor and glory and lets beat the bad guys.Women loved it for Gerry and his extraordinary body and the true love he shows for his strong, smart wife.Anyone, regardless of age or gender, can find something appealing in this unusual, interesting, completely different movie. Yes, the special effects are eye-popping, even today when we're inundated with effects. These are quieter and stranger. There is a surreal quality to them that works. Yes, the story (although not strictly historically accurate) is a classic tale of sacrifice and honor to which any thinking person will respond to with pride and sadness. Yes, Gerard is gorgeous and the perfect King for his time, but he is more: he is the personification of the noble warrior, the reluctant warrior, who would rather make love to his wife and raise his son than fight the invaders, but does what &#34;a free man&#34; has to do to stay free.There is some gratuitous violence and grossness - I could have done without the leprosy-ridden priests and the malformed Persians. And, yes, there is no attempt at political correctness. Thank goodness. That was not a popular concept in ancient Sparta and would have been ridiculous if it had been inserted into this movie.This is a film that grows on you. A film that is better at the 2nd viewing and will surprise you with things you missed at the 3rd viewing.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3LWS1L674IYH7	Sir Furboy	The story of the battle of thermopylae is rightly one of the most enduring and important last stands in history. Without this battle the whole of European history would be very different. Persia would have destroyed the Greek army and the later victories would not have occurred. It also has all the elements of a heroic tragedy. 300 Spartans hold back the Persians for 3 days at the hot gates (thermoplae in Greek), and end up dying heroically.It is therefore a perfect battle for a good Hollywood film. But this film is more (and less) than a historical telling. It includes quite a lot of historical detail, such as the names of the heros and villains, or the event where the Persian emissaries were pushed down a well, but it also very deliberately plays with that history, by introducing mythical beasts, and stylising the Persians in particular in mystical but very ahistorical ways.The end result is a beautifully wrought imaginary epic, loosely based on actual events. The film was shot on blue screen with studio sets, and this shows. Sparta feels like a sound studio, and the hot gates have an enclosed feel. All this would have felt cheap if it was intended as a historical film, but because it was essentially a fantasy, it all somehow worked, and allowed some beautiful cinematography.However, anyone left with the impression that it really was juts 300 noble Spartans making the last stand should maybe go check the history. True there were 300 Spartans ked by King Leonidas, but they were, in the historical battle, outnumbered by some 400 Thebans and probably even more Helots. Also the enslavement of the majority of the population of Sparta (the Helots) is brushed aside and ignored, giving the impression Sparta was populated Spartans, and not that they were ruling overlords like the Normans in 12th Century England.nevertheless this is a great film. The introduction of mythical elements serve as a warning that this is not a historical depiction, so I don't feel angry about those points as I would if it was being passed off as history. Instead I enjoyed a thoroughly entertaining action film, and would recommend it to anyone who likes action films of any type.	5.0	Just Don't Rely on it for a History Exam	2012-06-29	0	0	0

Of course, how you missed the history channel and wound up in a movie theater or with this DVD is beyond me, but you would know how better than me. This movie was based on a graphic novel which was based on the legendary (not historical) version that has been going around for about 2487 years. To watch this movie you must leave your amateur historian tendencies behind and just enjoy what is a very good story, done in a very entertaining way.

When King Leonidas asks his group of 300 Spartans what their professions are, the response is 100% unified....Soldiers.300 is Frank Miller's graphic novel about the Battle of Thermopylae (circa 480 B.C.) that pitted a small army of Spartans against legions of Persians. And the graphic novel comes to life via the excellent direction of Dawn of the Dead's Zack SnyderDawn of the Dead (2004 Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut).Rest assured, Butler is not singing opera or doing theater (The Phantom of the Opera (Two-Disc Special Edition)) in 300. He is one lean, mean, bad motor-scooter as King Leonidas. His task?...To defeat the Persian army led by Xerxes (played superbly by Rodrigo Santoro {perhaps most famous for his Season 3 role in the TV series LostLost - The Complete Third Season}.King Leonidas' Queen, Gorgo, does her share of dealing out pain as well. She is played by Lena Headey who takes on the tough-girl role of Sarah ConnorTerminator 2 - Judgment Day (Extreme DVD)of Terminator fame in the upcoming 2008 FOX TV series.The action in 300 rarely let's up, and when it does you're glued to the screen by stunning visuals and captivating acting.Much of 300's graphic novel look and feel are preserved in the screen adaptation. The battles are brutal, but captured in an almost surreal vision of turning the pages of the graphic novel.300 is one for the collectors bin.

Russel Crow may not be a nice guy in person but he is one hell of a actor. What i don't get is why do all the 300 spartans look like rejects from the WWE. They don't have not one hair on there body this story takes place thousands of years ago where did they get those completly wax bodies. The Persian king is so gay looking Liberace would say that he is way to flamboyant. Speaking of the WWE why is it that all the Spartan's shout there dialog i was half expecting Randy 'The macho man' Salvage to come out at any minute. The main reason i think this movie sucks is the director i never heard of the dude who directed this. If they were to be more acurate with the true story hire better actors, a better script and director who has alot of experience with doing action movies. This movie reminds me of those ones that MST3K make fun of but those have a reason they are bad they have no budget. They should bring that show back to TV but instead of poking fun of no budget movies they should make fun of crappy hollywood blockbusters like this.	1.0	Gladiator wanabe	2007-11-26	32	15	17

If you were to place all 175,693 feature films made in order from the very worst at position 175,693 (which would be Shock Treatment) and the very best at position 1, then the movie 300 would be at position -1, consistent with its status as better than the best movie ever made. But 300 is also a movie that was made. The logical but shocking deduction from these facts is that 300 is actually BETTER THAN ITSELF! Through an indisputable recursive loop of truly awesome abs, 300 will also occupy all positions of the list from -2 through -infinity.

The story was incredible, and told very well.  Several of the battle sequences really whet the appetite of the armchair war tactical strategist.  But the flat, fake, chrome-like colors of the film (which make this almost look like a comic book), really take away from the experience.  The slow-motion photography also detracts from the credibility of the film - I can only guess that this technique was used to simulate a 3D effect, which it accomplished to a certain degree, but not enough to make this movie visually appealing.  Also, the ""look"" they chose for King Xerxes was awful!  From the research I've done on this individual, I don't believe the costume to be historical - perhaps this was just another of the filmmaker's surreal visuals for shock value?"	3.0	Good Story, Horrible Visuals	2007-09-11	4	0	4

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2IG2FG7L85RMU	Stanley H. Nemeth	"This film has all the pleasures - but all the limitations - of a skillful comic book. The astonishing graphics resemble by design those in the original picture novel, and much of the gripping battlefield action -spears hurtling, blood spurting, heads being lopped off - is also retained. It's important, I'd argue, to evaluate a film in the spirit in which it was conceived, in this case history as filtered through the somewhat distorting lens of an action (graphic) novel. Consequently, the fact that elephants and a rhinoceros were not present at the actual battle of Thermopylae(as some critics have bemoaned), nor that Xerxes himself was a more formidable opponent than a muscular, but heavily bejewelled go-go boy should be noted, even though they do not seriously undermine the film, which isn't setting out to be literal history. More to the point, and the movies' credit, is its central insistence that the Greeks were defending a sort of democracy against a Persian tyranny, a view which does ring historically true. Also, the exchange between the King of Sparta and one of his dying soldiers (""It was a honor to fight alongside such a King as you"" answered by ""It was an honor to fight alongside a Spartan like you""), whether historical or not, impresses with its undeniable nobility of spirit, just like those grand and witty lines from Herodotus the film does include.If the film has flaws, I'd say they reside, first of all, in the too simple hero/villain opposition that fits a comic book more than a realistic historical account.  Any Spartan limitations are largely discounted as a consequence. Further, the film does get into some tedious family values and feminist stuff that seem out of place for the time. Shifts from the battlefield back to Sparta to include these have mostly the boring intrusiveness of those ""meanwhile, back at the ranch"" sequences that used to disfigure westerns. Also, the dialogue sometimes veers between almost contemporary street slang ( wording pretty close to ""I've got your back"") coupled with highly inverted sentences that sound pseudo-Shakespearean.But, again, these are flaws easily tolerable when taken in conjunction with the film's undeniable excitement, memorable graphics, and moments of genuine nobility."	4.0	"""Once More Unto The Hot Gates...."""	2007-03-26	8	6	2

It is basic visceral, patriotic, saber rattling that can be applied to the US Revolution, the French Revolution, WWII or to any time free men fought against tyranny. It's not some deep story with a thousand sub plots or side stories, it just around two hours of over the top bravado and butt whooping with some of the best stylized visuals, pulled directly from the comic on which it is based as if the comic alone was used as a storyboard.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A227TVKO02BCXC	Stephanie R. Kennerley	"I didn't see 300 when it appeared in theaters. Like many, I had briefly studied the history of the battle of Thermopylae, and found the story intriguing. However, I expected 300 to be nothing but a series of fight scenes with little else to contribute. I also shied away from its popularity, as I strive to avoid most fads.How wrong I was.300 presents a deep retelling of an historic battle, leaving the audience pondering the virtues of honor, duty, and glory.It is relatively short for this sort of historical movie, which lends to its ability to be watched over and over again. The cinematography is absolutely amazing, and the stunt fighting is so well choreographed and executed that you really leave the story with a renewed understanding of the dominance of the Spartan military.Although not technically historically accurate in places (though it's hard to be sure of history that occurred more than 2000 years ago), 300 does do a good job of communicating the ideals of Spartan culture. Also, some of the dialogue is actually historically attributed to the characters who spoke them (such as Queen Gorgo's quip that only Spartan women give birth to real men), and Spartans leaving for battle were indeed reminded to ""come back with your shield, or on it"" (as the shield was used to protect not only the individual but other Spartan warriors, if the shield was lost it was assumed that it was abandoned in an attempt to flee, which constituted a high crime).Gerard Butler, with his intense and moving screen presence, was the perfect choice for King Leonidas (and also, amazingly, had the strength and fortitude to perform all of his own stunt fighting). Also notable were Dominic West in his portrayal of devious and sleazy Theron, Michael Fassbender as the Spartan warrior Stelios (who is not a major character, but whose valor and fighting skills are surpassed only by Leonidas, in my opinion), and David Wenham portraying Delios, the narrator and Spartan warrior with a penchant for words.Lastly, it deserves mentioning that the actors playing the Spartan warriors represent the pinnacle of physical fitness; man or woman could easily lose themselves staring into the chiseled abdominals, the surging back muscles, or the powerful thighs.300 is recommended for anyone intrigued by Greek history, anyone seeking a good action movie, anyone seeking to be uplifted by a story of free men fighting to maintain their independence against a tyrant, and anyone who has any appreciation for beautiful cinematography. In short, 300 is recommended for anyone."	4.0	For once, the media hooplah was right.	2009-06-26	3	3	0

I would suggest that parents could skip the part(s) that they deemed to be too much while viewing with a particular child.That said, this movie is exciting, interesting, sexy, and action packed.

John ""Magnoliasteve"""	If you like big time action movies, I think you will absolutely love this film for its pure entertainment value. If you view this film expecting a history lesson, you are probably going to be disappointed. The film does more or less follow the storyline of the Battle at Thermopolaye as told by Herodotus, but Frank Miller uses a great deal of artistic license as he tells one of history's most famous military tales where a small, well-trained force valiantly holds its own against oppressive numbers. He presents both the Greeks and Persians as grossly exaggerated caricatures of good and evil - the Spartans presented as the perfect male warriors, chisled with long flowing hair, fighting for truth, justice and the Spartan way, while the Persians as the monsterously predatory attackers, seeking to assimilate everything in its path while decimating any resistance. Therein lies some of the artistic license.The actors give solid perfromances and the action is incredible. While it is gory, much of the savagry is implied rather than exploited. The film style provides an ancient feel as well.I have read a great deal of criticism of the film for its historical inaccuracies, and certainly there are probably many. But, in general, Herodotus describes a tale of a small band of exceptionally trained soldiers holding off a vast army for several days at the pass of Thermopolaye in 480 B.C. The film delivers that story in incredible fashion.	5.0	I loved it!	2007-08-26	1	0	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	Wish more folk would write about the quality of the Blu Ray disc rather than provide a summary of the story or a treatise of the historical accuracy.  No opinions here on acting or plot, just a review of the transfer quality.I do have the Standard Def DVD and I did not notice that much improvement in the video transfer.  While this movie was one of the first to use such a great amount of color grading and much CGI, there are areas in the video transfer that do contain a noticeable grain.  Nothing too distracting but it is there.  This is especially so in the first several minutes of the film and during the scene at the end where the king's wife receives back the amulet the king sent back to her.  The grain appears not to be present during the majority of the film and good detail can be seen throughout.  The colors are fairly sharp (as I said, this was a highly colorized production) There were no artifacts that I could see, nor aliasing or stair stepping.The disc defaults to Dolby Digital 5.1 so be sure to go to the audio selection to highlight the Dolby True HD 5.1 which really is the star of this transfer.  There is excellent use of your entire audio system, including the LFE channel, with much use of discreet audio from both fronts and rears.  The audio's use of discreet channeling is something to be appreciated as it is often the first thing they put in less effort for to keep costs down I guess.Bottom line, the audio is the highlight of this BR transfer and is certainly Demo worthy.There are plenty of extras, 3 deleted scenes, commentary and a couple of interesting documentaries on the historical accuracy and what life was like for Spartans back then.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks	4.0	300 on Blu Ray	2012-11-28	7	7	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AZCDCO6KK2T81	"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan"""	"I love a film that excites, entertains, educates, and motivates me.  300 does ALL that.The action is all first-rate.  The battle is epic, graphic, and emotionally charged.  I was entertained for the entire length of the film as both the action and the actors are outstanding.  Hopefully, Gerard Butler,The Phantom of the Opera, finally gets the recognition that has so far unfairly eluded him and the same could be said for the equally under appreciated David Wenham (The Lord of the RingsandVan Helsing).  It is rare to find such compelling acting and actors in a war film such as this (consider the rather weak, but still entertainingTroy).While I am well aware that this is a fictionalized account of a true event, it did realistically recreate the era.  I am a student of the ancient Greek culture as I teach Homer'sThe Odysseyto my 9th grade Honors English students and I can say fairly that this film really got it right.  In addition, certain aspects of the film educated me on things about the era I was unaware of and, thus, motivated me to research it a bit.  A prime example is the raising of a ""professional"" army by Butler's character.  Both Butler's character and his army were really raised in the manner presented in the film.  I would prefer to have a smaller army of 300 professionally trained soldiers who did nothing else in their lives other than prepare for and fight wars, then to have 1,000 carpenters, bakers, fishermen, and so forth who have some skill at warfare and fight occassionally.  Thus, Butler's comment to such a following that ""It seems you have come more unprepared than I.""The political intrigues created for the film that were not in the graphic novel are not as distracting as some here would have us believe.  They do represent the kind of strategies  typical of the time period.  Odysseus's wife, Penelope, and her son, Telemachus, experienced even more treachery during the time he was away at war with Troy in ""The Odyssey.""  I was glad to see these added scenes that realistically represented what might have happened back at home during this war.  I know some consider these scenes ""fillers"" or some kind of commentary on Bush's administration for creating an ""illegal war"" and such, but I don't agree as the scenes are relevant to the storyline and even if the scenes are saying something on Bush, so what?  Good grief, it's just a movie for crying out loud.The only thing that I felt was unnecessary in the film were the sexual scenes.  I'm no prude by any means, but for me sex and nudity within a film should have some real purpose and here it felt rather gratuitous and added only because it was expected in this kind of film.  It simply felt like some kind of required element much like the stereotypical sexy, but evil female spy in a James Bond film.Other than my one criticism noted above, this film is flawless as it accomplishes all it set out to do and then some.  This was film making on an epic scale and it even rose to an art form with its stylized photography, graphic images, and direction.  This is a must-own film for those that love this genre."	5.0	On a scale of one to ten . . . 300!!!!!	2007-09-13	2	2	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1ZS51IOOAP46W	Stryker Kane	"Ok, first to justify TWO stars:  the CGI effects were pretty cool and the sepia tones were a nice 'historical' touch.Now, I'm all for artistic license but I felt seriously BUSHwhacked by this movie.  I'm a fan of Greek/Roman history as a grown-up replacement for my Dungeons&Dragons; youth and I expected to maintain a suspension of disbelief in the qualities of the hero such as in Gladiator or a Die Hard movie.  I hadn't read the graphic novel '300' (in fact ANY graphic novel since I was 16).My first gripe is admittedly the break from history, but I admit 300 bronze clad Greeks holding off 200,000 half-naked dudes with wicker shields would not quite instill the heroic stance of the fight scenes, though in reality the Spartans are nonetheless heroes for defending their homeland from Persian expansion.  I suppose I was taken aback when the Persians ended up having a bunch of monsters - not that I'm against monster movies per se' - but it's sorta the disconnect of sitting down to watch a movie on the revolutionary war and then the red-coats turn into zombies.  There's a context shift I wasn't prepared for and never quite got over.My second gripe (and I don't know if this is in the graphic novel) was the political/sociological brow-beating.  Now I realize the movie need not get into the fact that Sparta was in reality a theologically-based monarchy and that part of the intense social engineering of Sparta was to create homosexual pair-bonds between each of the men in 10,000.  But the fact that Gerard actually makes a reference to the 'boy lovers' in Athens and chats-up the defense of democracy, for which he's apparently fighting is humorously off base.  The back-story on the senate not supporting the troops sounds like an oddly familiar theme and the Queen's (BTW, Sparta was ruled by a pair of Kings) dramatic ""freedom isn't free"" brought laughter and groans across the audience.Lastly, this movie depended too much on CGI with not a lot of plot depth or acting (compared to Gladiator or Troy where they had real people talking to each other most of the time).  My wife said Saturday Night Live should do a skit of '300' where they speak with clenched teeth the entire skit, asking about whether they're on the Atkin's diet and what do they think about the tai bo workout.Like I said, it seemed like a Bush propaganda film held together with (admittedly beautiful) CGI-candy."	2.0	CGI-Fest for the Bush Administration	2007-07-13	67	11	56
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3TEH90X39WC8F	"Stuart W. Mirsky ""swm"""	"Visually impressive, this film captures the comic book elements of its source brilliantly. But as a tale of the Spartan stand against the Persians it is woefully unhistoric and overwrought. The Spartans are nearly all ferocious superheroes, not men at all in the ordinary sense, and they are all lovers of ""freedom."" They are ""drawn"" (perhaps visually enhanced is a better way of putting it) with muscles on top of muscles and they are courageous and dauntless to a man. Against them are ranged the inhuman monsters of the evil Persian king Xerxes, a man who stands twice the height of an ordinary man, is shaved from head to toe, prances about nearly naked, is covered with facial and body rings in the most decadent fashion imaginable and speaks with a deep, echoing resonance suggesting he is the devil himself.He appears on a giant throne, drawn by slaves who are, themselves, little more than inhuman monsters, and approaches the front line to parley with good King Leonidas, the noble Spartan. Never mind that there would have been little likelihood the Persian King of Kings would have driven to the battle's front lines on a giant mobile throne, or any other contraption, to face the Spartan king and thereby risk being killed by a Spartan surprise. Xerxes was, famously, the less than successful son of his predecessor, Darius, and typically traveled surrounded by his army. There is certainly no record that he was the sort to get out in front and, centuries later, when Alexander crushed the Persians, their king stayed well back from the front and only fled when Alexander broke through. The whole picture here of Xerxes is fantasy.No less unrealistic than Xerxes himself, his army, seems to have been imported from another planet. At one point a soldier atop a charging rhinoceros (what human has ever been able to harness and ride a rhino?) comes plowing into the Spartan phalanxe but not to worry, for the huge beast is downed by a single well thrown Spartan spear. Ah, those Spartans!Xerxes' Immortals (his personal guard) and his other minions are portrayed throughout as distorted, corrupted beings, disfigured creatures we can easily imagine slaughtering in battle without pity since they aren't really human like our heroic Spartans, who live and die and eat and breathe and laugh and grieve -- just like us (or as we imagine ourselves doing). Indeed, we are given little of the Spartans' own cruel culture here or, in their constant talk of ""freedom,"" any revelation concerning the Helots -- Greek slaves who lived under their cruel thumb, did their bidding and were routinely sacrificed on the altar of Spartan brutality (a highly practiced strategy intended to strike fear into the Helots and make them permanently submissive to their Spartan masters).This film is all ""glory"" and bloody battle, killing and getting killed. And, while the Spartans are noble and heroic, the villains are utterly bad, including the Spartan elders or ephors, portrayed here as vile, barely human monsters living apart from other Spartans in a mystical sanctuary atop a mountain where they sexually enslave beautiful young Spartan females! Or King Leonidas' rival who rapes the good king's wife while Leonidas is off at war saving Greece from the monstrous Persians. No mention here, either, of the Spartan practice of dual kingship. Leonidas, of course, is only one of two Spartan kings but you don't get any sense of that from this film, either.I suppose ""300"" accurately portrays the comic book or ""graphic novel"" it was based on (at least it seems to do this visually) and that is an accomplishment of sorts. But I'd rather have seen Pressfield'sGates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae, itself a somewhat unseemly glorification of the Spartans, in film form than this cartoon-like rendering of these famous events. And for a more realistic view of the Spartans, themselves, one would be even better off going to Nicholas Nicastro'sThe Isle of Stone: A Novel of Ancient Sparta, about the Spartan defeat by the Athenians in the famous battle of Sphacteria in the Pelopennesian War which followed the Greek defeat of Xerxes at Plataea, after the Hot Gates. (The Spartans actually ended up winning the Pelopennesian War, of course, and imposed a brief tyranny on the Athenians who ultimately managed to break free and, in alliance with other Greek City states, finally defeated the Spartans and broke their grip on the land mass of Greece. Sparta's great weakness was its elitism which kept the conquered Helots down as slaves rather than absorbing them into the nation and growing stronger from the addition of other peoples.)Xerxes, himself, by the way, was only a man and not an especially terrifying one at that, if the historical record is to be believed. He certainly wasn't the dread, devil incarnate this film hands us. For another view of the mighty Xerxes, you can read L. Sprague de Camp'sThe Dragon of the Ishtar Gate, a really enjoyable adventure tale set in Xerxes' time which is probably truer to its era and characters -- though it is somewhat tongue-in-cheek (but more fun, for that).Now that would make a hell of a movie.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"	3.0	True to its Comic Book Beginnings	2008-03-04	8	6	2

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2JEONEOLE4FD2	"Subash S L ""slsubash"""	I am not a lover of mindless or unnecessary violence but violence even worse than what is depicted in the movie actually did take place in history. War was a very gory thing in the past, a time when they did not have guns, bullets and cannons. War was more painful and bloody. Death wasn't instantaneous either.The most important thing to remember is that 300 is based more on Frank Miller's novel than historical facts.Using Special FX and computer graphics 300 shows warfare beautifully and in surreal colour tones. Watching a movie as this one wonders whether in reality the battles were so perfect. The action is gory.However the bravery of Leonidas and his men cannot be forgotten. But what the movie does not mention is the fact that some 700 Thespians also laid down their lives after pledging their alliance to Leonidas. Some others Helots and Thebans also died for Leonidas although a good number of Thebans deserted him and defected to Xerses in the final moments of the battle.Another important aspect that most war movies tend to miss and one aspect that cannot be avoided in a movie as this is supplies. In most war movies the audience is supposed to assume how food and supplies reached the soldiers, where they bathed (of course where/how they eased themselves cannot obviously be shown). Where were the 300 getting their food from? Are we to believe that Spartans in those times could do without food for days? That would have been ridiculous. In one scene Leonidas is shown eating an apple while his men are finishing off the wounded and the dying. But in all the shots of all his men there is no such scene as to where their food is coming from. An elaborate scene is not what is expected but certainly without food where did they get their energyfrom. In more than one scene the entire lot or most of them are shown just with their armour, 6 packs, spears and swords.In History one of the bravest stand off's took place when the Mughals were trying to capture the brave Banda Bahadur. When nothing worked for months, the enemies blocked and destroyed the supplies. The starving Sikhs killed their horses and ate them and finally when no food was available they surrendered and got killed. So cutting of supplies IS a major move in warfare.One more thing that movies of the past aren't good at showing is this. In hand to hand sword or lance combat is it very possible to kill a man with just one stroke? Most of the war movies show it that way. Probably dispatching an enemy in one stroke was the quickest thing but that ain't the truth. Bear in mind that even a vanquished enemy soldier was made a fighter, to fight unto the death. So many a time more than one stroke of the spear, sword or dagger is needed to kill a soldier although the movie claims that the fighting-loving Spartans were the best of fighters or killers able to dispatch enemies with almost fatal single blows.Leonidas's wife giving in to the advances of Theron and finally the confrontation with him in the Senate could have been avoided. The historically inaccurate Xerxes was also a let down adding unwanted glamour to the brave story.Gerard Butler as Leonidas did a splendid job though.Some other last stands are noteworthy to be mentioned. Perhaps the biggest in history is when it comes to the ratio of soldier vs the adversary (1:476) was the Battle of Saragarhi where just 21 Sikh soldiers, of the 36'th Sikh Regiment, then part of the British Indian Army, fought off 10,000 Afghans. All of the 21 soldiers got killed and were awarded the Victoria Cross posthomously.	4.0	Beautiful violence	2008-10-04	0	0	0

Led by the ferocious King Leonidas (Butler), the 300 'no retreat, no surrender' Spartans - all picked because they had at least one son to carry on their name - defied the mystics and fought The Battle Of Thermopylae. How director Zack Snyder made a movie so gory, so violent, yet so beautiful to look at is beyond me. This is the movie's selling point, as characterisation is minimal and the performers are reduced to shouting their lines, even though they may be whippet-smart laconic quips the Spartans were famous for. It does tend to get a bit Lord-Of-The-Ringsy (now a recognised term) with the various deformed characters, armoured elephants and angry rhinos - but that's neither here nor there. This is a movie event that finally delivers - a jaw-dropping, magnificent spectacle that will reinvent the old swords-and-sandals epic that suffered at the hands of the messy Troy, the boring Kingdom Of Heaven and the wholly underwhelming Alexander. 300 is a victory of style over substance - actually it's more than a victory.	5.0	FUN..	2007-10-28	0	0	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2JFDCLA9PZGQ0	Teemacs	I guess the only people who should see (and judge) this film are those who have read the comic book (which I haven't) and/or who are fans of the genre (I'm not particularly). As a comic book brought to life, I can appreciate how cleverly it's done - the way the action is sometimes slowed down, so that one gets the impression of succeeding frames in a comic book, and the whole stylised method of presentation. However, for me, this novel approach only works up to a point, and then it becomes a bit silly and over-the-top. The theatrics are, shall we say, somewhat too theatrical. And did we really need rhinos, elephants, monsters, Immortals as Ninjas and a Xerxes eight feet tall? Is this not, er, slightly weird?Moreover, as a history lover, I am put off by the many inaccuracies. The Spartans did not fight in their red cloaks and, like all Greek hoplites (heavy infantry) they wore body armour. This may not look as appealing as protruding abs, but it ensured their survivability on the battlefield against the Persians with their wicker shields and lack of armour. Yes, I realise that it's not meant to be historically accurate, but that's just my way of looking at things. In addition, it's amusing to see great of gouts of blood flying as the Spartans strike home, yet, when the afflicted Persian spins, there is no sign of a commensurate wound.So, great for comic book fans, who can accept the format, not so good for others.	2.0	A bizarre concoction	2007-08-19	7	2	5

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2MYUI8IT6UBUU	"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com"""	"An adrenaline-charged rush of fantastically stylish visuals, colossal battles, and gratuitously fulfilling bloodshed, 300 manages to ground itself with enough genuine heart and solemn sincerity to propel itself into epic entertainment not confined only to audiences of masculine design. 300 is the first must-see film of 2007, a mature, visually arresting cinematic fantasy thrill-ride.Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, 300 closely follows the writer's often historically inaccurate, though unquestionably imaginative, retelling of the extraordinary Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. When messengers arrive in Sparta announcing the advance of the tyrannical Persian ruler Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) must choose whether to surrender or fight for the freedoms of Sparta. Determined to defy the deranged warlord and protect his homeland, but restricted by the inane traditions and corrupt politics halting supported action, Leonidas leads 300 of his finest Spartan soldiers into battle against the massive Persian army. Using cunning strategy, superior combat techniques, and the advantageous terrain of Greece herself, the dauntless Spartans fend off wave after wave of increasingly deadly Persian warriors. Meanwhile, Spartan Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) wages her own battle against traitorous politicians in an effort to send reinforcements to her valiant King and his vastly outnumbered soldiers.While special effects are sometimes forced to drive a film short on story, such is not the case with 300. Miller's story is as compelling as it is entertaining and the effects used to translate his artwork to the screen only enhance his tale of honor and bravery. Superbly adapted from Miller's drawings and Lynn Varley's coloring, the stunning imagery created perfectly captures each panel of art and realizes the unseen action in between. Little is left to the imagination, but few could dream up a more fantastical world. The hyper-stylistic melding of digital creatures, backgrounds, and effects with Miller's characters and Snyder's flair for storytelling create an experience unlike any else. Imagine the slick, kinetic visuals of Sin City combined with the exciting, epic battles in Lord of the Rings, then throw Gladiator-esque soldiers into the mix and you only begin to describe the sensory feast that comprises 300.Masterfully drawing upon the artistic influences of Miller's original graphic novel, the movie also creatively expands upon its premises by adding several characters and events. The subplot of Queen Gorgo's plight against the senate, as well as her defiantly pronounced character to begin with, supplement the bloody bouts of warfare and boast the very reasons the 300 men risk their lives. Extra insanely crafted villains like the Uber-Immortal and Rhinoceros heighten the already incredible adversaries the Spartans faced, and the intensely vibrant visual style Snyder has created often outshines its source material.With so much imagery filling every frame, one might assume character development would lose out to action, but the talented cast utilizes every scene to reveal their characters' intentions and unspoken emotions with fervent vitality. Gerard Butler confidently portrays the noble Spartan King with measured reserve and a powerful, commanding presence; and with both brains and brawn on the battlefield a truly heroic figure is born. Lena Headey exudes an assured sexiness and an authoritative demeanor as the dignified Queen, and even the villainous Xerxes matches his exotically terrifying appearance with deceptively calm delivery and menacing poise.As Frank Miller himself proclaimed, ""There is no way to tell the story of 300 without being amazingly brutal."" And brutal it is. But with vicious crimsons spraying the battlefields while bronze clouds clutch the skies, the spectacular action scenes resemble art more than carnage - and well it should, for this is stylized violence at its finest, a necessity in conjuring the apprehension and admiration required to effectively recount this remarkable tale of bravery and survival in the face of insurmountable odds.I give 300 a ""10"" not just because it so flawlessly realizes Miller's vision and expands upon it, or that it so effortlessly entertains with wave after wave of ever intensifying visceral imagery, but because it so adequately lived up to my expectations of displaying in unrestrained glory, abundant slow-motion, and free flowing, gorgeously bloody art exactly what I wanted to see in an epic story recounting the valorous last stand of the world's finest warriors - a feat few other films could hope to accomplish.- Joel Massie"	5.0	300 Movie Review	2007-08-02	6	6	0
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1KMG1AIUS00DC	"The Movie Man ""tenebre89"""	"""300 - The Limited Collector's Edition"" is a deluxe repackaging of the feature film with mountains of bonus extras.  The plot focuses on the Battle of Thermopylae, when armies of the Persian Empire were hot to conquer Sparta.  The macho Spartans have been indoctrinated since birth to never surrender, never retreat.  King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) leads 300 of his bravest men to lure the Persians into a narrow gorge where the enemy's huge numbers will be of no advantage.  However, traitors are working to undermine Sparta's attempt to maintain its independence.Based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller (""Sin City""), ""300"" is a bloody movie filled with over-the-top, intense images and a stylized manner of acting in which performers are given to shout and bluster, delivering every line as if it were vitally significant.  This tends to get tired pretty quickly.  But the movie is fun, if only for the wild visuals combining live action and CGI animation and the film's muted color palette.  In its clear demarcation between good and evil, ""300"" is hardly subtle and in many ways is a throwback to films of the 1950's when the audience knew from the get-go that the star was the one to root for.  This is simple story-telling embellished with breathtaking visuals, the true attraction of the movie.The Limited Collector's Edition contains the previously released two-disc Special Edition along with the new documentary, ""To the Hot Gates: A Legend Retold,"" a look at the process the filmmakers followed to take a graphic novel's treatment of an ancient legend and realize it as a feature film.  There are also a digital copy of the movie, a 52-page hardcover art book, a lucite display with motion film image, and six photo cards."	3.0	Great Visuals, Over-the-Top Performances	2008-11-17	2	2	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2CYZDA1HZWX6W	The Undertaker	"In short, this is a comic book turned into a movie with video game aesthetics, telling the tale of the 300 Spartans who died fighting back parts of the Persian army at Thermopylae in 480 BCE. The veryfact that the introduction rather cheerfully depicts the eugenic conditions of Spartan adolescence, and that the almost two hours of film are filled to the brim with (some, historically accurate) lines mirroring Spartan warrior ethics, could make this movie into a nice sliproad from a seemingly endless stream of movies focusing on the quite tiresome theme of modern individualism.But that's only on the surface. In one scene, the Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) lectures on the importance of the army keeping together, using their shields to protect each other, and  consequently creating a strong unity. In combat, this unity is initially kept, but then each Spartan runs along towards his own one-on-one battle, showing off a few hokum stunts. Interestingly, this is quite a precise parable for what makes this movie collapse: there is nothing keeping it together. This makes the movie, at its heart, into the very opposite of what it is set out to be. The exterior of an over-blown praise of an interpretation of Spartan life, accompanied by mediocre acting, blue screen animations, Hollywood sound effects, NuMetal riffs, billions of slow-motions, and the constant use of the increasingly obscure concept of ""freedom,"" will most probably entertain some people. But beneath all this, there is nothing.Those who seek art that beautifully portrays heroism, will not find it here.Not even the debate on whether the movie draws its motivations from current politics or not is very interesting. Instead, what makes this work sort of fascinating as a phenomenon, and meaningful to review at all, is that it's an excellent example of the extreme contrast between modern and traditional thinking, and of surface versus content. These filmmakers take some ingredients from the past, but don't know how to deal with them other than by throwing them into a stew of modern decorations and purposes.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"""300"", the new film based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller (""Sin City""), is easily one of the most interesting and visual films I have ever seen. Lots of time and effort went into creating a unique and stylized look for the film. Generally, when this happens, the director and production team have little energy, time left for things like story and character development. But writer - director Zack Snyder (""Dawn of the Dead (2004)"") has also adapted an interesting and involving story from the celebrated graphic novelist's work.King Leonidas (Gerard Butler, ""Andrew Lloyd Weber's The Phantom of the Opera"", ""Dear Frankie""), fearless leader of the Spartans, receives a messenger from King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro, ""Love, Actually"", TV's ""Lost""), the king of Persia and ruler of all Asia. ""Surrender to him and you can keep your kingdom"". Leonidas doesn't know the meaning of the word ""surrender"" and, against the wishes of the elders, amasses an army of 300 of his fiercest warriors to do battle with Xerxes' army of tens of thousands. Sounds like a fair match to Leonidas. They know of a small valley leading through two mountain passes and intend to use this as a bottleneck for the enemy, picking them off slowly and surely.  His Queen, Gorgo (Lena Headey, ""The Brothers' Grimm"", ""Ripley's Game""), stays behind and tries to convince the council to send a full army, to back up her husband. Dilios (David Wenham, ""The Proposition"", ""Lord of the Rings""), a warrior who also serves as an oral historiographer, narrates the story and helps to ensure the legend will live on.Written and directed by Snyder and based on Miller's story, ""300"" has one of the most interesting, and consistent visual looks I have ever seen in a film. The filmmakers have gone to great pains to recreate the look of Miller's art; most, if not all, of the film was shot in front of a blue screen with the backgrounds and physical locations added later, allowing them to give the film an artistic look. Throughout the film, this adds a touch of drama to the look and feel of the story. Leonidas marches up stairs to a temple on a mountaintop, the full moon sitting directly behind it (a truly beautiful image) and this would never have been possible with sets and other forms of traditional filmmaking. In a prologue, we learn how Leonidas fought a wolf. The wolf, a creation of CGI, is, nonetheless, very fearsome. As the two creatures circle one another, snow falls on the barren mountain, providing one of the most `graphic novel-like' images in the film. As the 300 warriors move off to do battle, they walk through a field of grain waving in the wind. As they battle, we see brief snippets of their confrontations with various creatures, all of which is depicted in a way that can be rightfully described as beautiful. As much as a film with so much violence, blood and gore can be, ""300"" is a beautiful film to watch.This technique of shooting the film almost entirely in front of a blue screen has been used before (""Sin City"", also based on a Frank Miller graphic novel) and seems to lend itself well to this style of filmmaking. The difference between the two films is ""300"" does not have comic book panels and tries to depict the legend of the Battle of Thermopylae in a way befitting a legend. Don't get me wrong. I loved ""Sin City""; it is one of my favorite films, ""300"" is also very good, but ""300"" is shot in a way that reminds me of an artist painting on a canvas. The backgrounds and the settings are all created by computers and through special effects and the filmmakers have gone to great lengths to make them appear both painterly and different. Because this story is basically based on a legend, this style fits. Everything appears realistic, but also exaggerated, much like a myth or legend would be; it contains some elements of truth, but over the years, many parts of the story have been enhanced.Most films filled with special effects are missing some important key elements; a story, character development and people and things to care about. I am happy to say that ""300"" has these elements. I went to see the film with a friend of mine and the first thing he said as we left the theater was ""That had a really good story"", as though he was surprised. And he had every right to be. Most big budget films filled with special effects have at least one weak element, the story.  ""300"" follows the legend of King Leonidas and the events leading to the Battle of Thermopylae. Did this story actually happen? Maybe, but it has become more of a legend or myth at this point and the story is grand enough to fit the subject matter. The film begins with Delios recounting the birth and childhood of the boy who would become King Leonidas. In Sparta, boys grow up fighting, to become fierce warriors, and Leonidas is no exception. We watch a couple of key moments and then we meet the adult King and his wife and their son. These elements are all key because as soon as Xerxes' messenger arrives and tells Leonidas of the Persian King's ultimatum, we know Leonidas will never give in. And Leonidas dispatches the messenger in a pretty spectacular way. Then the story shifts and Leonidas has to try and amass an army against the wishes of his advisory council. But there are many key elements in this section which give the film depth and interest.The battle is interesting because they face a variety of foes, almost as though Xerxes sends in one team after the next, to see who will win, not really expecting he will have to have an all out battle. As each of these groups battles, the action is filmed in a unique way. We might see a character swing his huge blade at an attacker, the action will slow down considerably and then speed up slightly after impact. This technique is not new either, having been used in many, many martial arts films, but in ""300"", it adds an almost ballet-like look and feel to the battles, further adding to the beauty of the overall film. These scenes are pretty bloody, sometimes gory and very violent, so it seems odd to be calling them beautiful, but they are just that.The acting is full of shouts, grand gestures and broad movements, strangely fitting for a myth or tall tale. Gerard Butler almost always shouts, growls or grimaces, with every line, giving him the air of a man with a lot on his mind. He clearly loves his wife and son, but has the fate of his people in his hands. He must go to battle, even if it means 300 against tens of thousands. Dominic West plays Leonida's advisor and friend, Theron, a member of the council. He is more subtle, but also a man of State, so he does not have to go to battle and must stay behind to attend to politics. Lena Heady is very good as Queen Gorgo. She is a strong female character and that fact does not go unnoticed in this society; the messenger questions it, Theron uses it and Leonidas is attracted to it. David Wenham's Delios provides narration in the beginning and end and at periodic moments throughout. His voice struck me as slightly odd, as though he was trying to mimic Butler's fearsome growls, but didn't have the right type of voice. He often reminded me of a high school actor, someone narrating ""Our Town"", standing at the corner of the stage, trying to `emote' to the edges of the audience. I didn't expect Delios to partake in the battle, but he puts on his leather bikini and straps a piece of fabric over one shoulder just like all of the other soldiers in Leonida's army. Perhaps showing off their chiseled abs, and they are universally chiseled (perhaps a little touch up with CGI?) was a method of intimidation. Xerxes is played by Rodrigo Santoro, who suddenly appeared on the island in ""Lost"" and is perhaps best known as Laura Linney's object of lust in ""Love, Actually"". In ""300"", he is bald, very buff and covered with piercings and chains.The friend who accompanied me initially sent me an e-mail asking to join me when I went to see the film, stating ""300 scantily clad Spartans? I'm there."" I wonder if he realized going in they were all men. Because he's straight. Actually, there are a few moments when the bare flesh extends to women, but the main display of flesh is male.""300"" is a rousing film, filled with beautiful imagery and an involving story."	4.0	"4 1/2 - ""295"""	2007-03-16	13	10	3

Throughout the movie there is a visceral, masterful, and dark projection of physical power, unyielding will, and personal conviction unto death. These are woven artfully in ""300"" into a thrilling, inspiring, and desperate story that keeps you highly-strung with anticipation, even though you've known how it will end ever since you first read the story.But, even with license given to the Director to distill his revolutionary vision of these events, there was an excessive application of some techniques that hurt the movie for me:1. Far too much use of slow-motion action scenes. I struggle to think of one action scene that was filmed in ""normal"" time. And sometimes, the slow-motion scenes were intercut with ""fast-motion"" moments that made the effect even more distracting. The rock music vignettes, which were mercifully few and short, added nothing to a soundtrack that was otherwise very good.2. The unrealistic looking man-creatures didn't enhance or improve anything. Fortunately, there wasn't too much of this, either, but it definitely cheapened the effect of a genuine battle when these things appeared. The battle was shocking and electrifying enough on its own; it didn't need these over-the-top contrivances.3. Xerxes! Who in the world could possibly want to portray mighty Xerxes in such a ridiculous manner with this laughable, contemporary appearance?  Look at every single statue, carving, bust, and painting of what artists through the centuries have thought Xerxes looked like and none of them remotely resembled the funny-looking guy in this movie.  With his shaved head draped with pieces of jewelry, and his face punctured with rings and other decorative metal, the only other things he needed to look like a thug-""wanna be"" bottom-feeder in the Twenty-First Century was jeans, a pullover, and a backward baseball cap. Xerxes! King of Kings, and a human god, looking depressingly like today's urban dum-dum ""fashion-setter"", plucked right off an American city street corner. Clearly, this characterization did not work, even though the actor saddled with keeping a straight face in this part, Rodrigo Santoro, did a truly great job considering what he had to work with.All this said, if you are willing to suspend your disbelief, and if you enjoy a heart-pounding ancient war epic, I recommend this movie to you. It was great to see and hear the voice of David Wenham again (""Faramir"", in Lord of the Rings). Vincent Regan, as ""Captain"" provides as powerful and as emotionally-charged a supporting role as you'll ever see in a movie of this kind. Even with its faults, I mostly enjoyed the movie, and I admired the concept of a band of brothers who would fight to the death against a tyrant, and that's the true meaning of Thermopylae, in any depiction."	4.0	A very powerful movie that could have been great	2007-08-02	6	4	2
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AMNFD1Y9HLLGZ	"Tierra12 ""Tierra12"""	"300 is a visually stunning film adaptation of writer-artist Frank Miller's graphic novel 300 which is essentially a retelling of an important historical event during the Greco-Persian War.  This event is the Battle of Thermopylae which took place in 480 B.C. where 300 Spartans lead by King Leonidas took a stand against the massive forces of the invading Persian army (which was estimated to be between 200,000 and 2,000,000) lead by the God-King Xerexes.Being that the movie the 300 is an adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel do not expect this movie to be a totally accurate depiction of everything that took place during the Battle of Thermopylae.  For instance there are a few monstrosities on the Persian side to aide in making things even more interesting than the standard type of battle you would expect to see in a film like this.Also the battle wardrobe for the Spartan heroes is something else that isn't accurate.  Their battle wardrobe is barely existent (cape, Speedo, helmet, sword and shield) and no I'm not complaining.  I'm just pointing out the fact that it's certainly not the sort of battle uniform the Spartan army would have worn during a real battle being that it offers very little protection for the heroes.  To me the ""so called"" battle wardrobe that is present in the movie is a plus especially if you're a woman or an appreciator of the physical beauty of the well toned male form.  Also if you don't care for all the violence in the film then you might find looking at the heroes' abs, ripped biceps, and sculpted chests, and muscular legs to be a very good distraction.On the other hand if you're not interested in the heroes' washboard abs, ripped biceps, sculpted chests, or muscular legs you also won't be disappointed either because there's plenty for you to delight in as well.  This movie delivers on the blood-gore.  You can consider this movie to be an uncensored ancient battlefield being that the director shows the gruesomeness of war in all its bloody details. This movie also features plenty of well choreographed battle sequences.  You won't find any of the amateurish action sequences or confusing direction of the action as seen in the film Alexander or Gladiator.  This is topnotch stuff equal to Mel Gibson's work in Brave Heart, Wolfgang Peterson's work in Troy, or Peter Jackson's work in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.If these elements aren't enough for you still or if none of the aforementioned things appeal to you then you will also find that this movie offers plenty of topless women for men to stare at or others who enjoy seeing bare female [...].  There are larger than life heroes featured in the film to be captivated by.  Men who are loyal, brave, selfless, strong, well-trained, and honorable and a queen who is as equally strong as her husband King Leonidas.  There are also well done special effects which create this ancient-dangerous world in a stunning fashion that is sure to please many.Story-King Leonidas played by Gerard Butler learns news that Xerxes has amassed an army of millions to conquer mainland Greece and eventually all of Europe.  Instead of simply surrendering to these invaders King Leonidas decides to bravely face possible death to fight for Sparta's freedom.  Being that he has decided to go to war he seeks out  the Oracle.  Unbeknownst to him the priests of the oracle have already been bribed by Xerexs and so they interpret the oracle's message to mean  that King Leonidas should not go to war because it will interrupt the Carneian festival.Realizing that it makes sense to act now King Leonidas decides to take a small band of men:  300 Spartans,  some Arcadians, and other Greeks to meet the Persian invaders at Thermopylae which is a narrow valley adjacent to the sea.  They choose to meet the Persians here because it allows them to block the only road that the massive, multicultural army of slaves lead by Xerxes could pass through.  It also allows the Spartans to use their much smaller army in the most efficient way.  Their wonderful military strategy naturally leads to heavy losses on Xerxes side so he sends out his best against them, his personal bodyguards the immortals (who in the movie appear to be masked creatures).  They are also unsuccessful at beating the Spartans.

Artistically stunning and dynamic on the large screen, ""300"" excels at sucking you into its big, empty-headed world just on the unbelievable visuals.Sadly, that is the best thing about the ""300."" After that, I start to wonder why I see more 6-pack abs on the Spartans than on any men since I last visited West Hollywood's Gymnasium Row. In fact, this has got to be one of the most homoerotic movies to spit out such virulently homophobic dialog (the disparaging comments about ""philosophers and boy-lovers""). Which leads me to my next gripe. ""300"" is so inundated with CGI that you begin to wonder if there really were any actors here. Who ever designed the computer application to slap every Spartan with that hyper-body must have made a mint. Same for the guys that worked on the decapitation program. And the flying blood shots. Also - for ALL directors of action movies from now on - ENOUGH of the fast/slow/fast ""Matrix"" digital roto-scoping battles scenes! Please make a movie that doesn't look like you're designing a video game!Which is, ultimately, why I can't give ""300"" the five-stars that Miller and company obviously thought they were making. This is less a movie than a propagandist's art project. Otherwise, why make Gerard Butler a Jesus look-alike (especially his final scene) who spends most of his dialogue time speaking in soldier bark; ""SPARRRRTAAAANNNNSSSSS!"" starts most of his major scenes. Or why have the leader of the Persians look like RuPaul with more bling than all the members of 365 Mafia and more makeup than The Cure? Or why that all the He-men of Sparta (another great line early in ""300,"" ""Only Spartan women can give birth to real men."") are all big-muscled white Europeans in leather and loincloths while the Persians are pierced and tattooed punks, mutants and drag queens?Both ""Alexander"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"" were better than ""300"" as historical fact-based movies. And you've seen these battles in ""Lord Of The Rings,"" ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart,"" done better.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2YKADCJME4FSW	Tom Birkenstock	"Last Friday I saw a matin&eacute;e of 300.After the movie I had a cavity filled at my dentist. When they asked me if I wanted any painkillers I told them that Spartans didn't have pain killers. When Spartans were born they were subjected to years of dental checkups without Novocain. They would have mouths of cavities filled without one shot of anesthesia. When they drilled into my tooth I gave out a scream. A warrior scream, not a girly scream, never a girly scream. I cried ""We are Sparta!"" Well, it sounded more like ""Eee aaw Staaata!"" Of course, the dentist did wonder why I came in greased up and in an ancient loincloth, but then again she probably didn't see the movie.That night my girlfriend tried to fry me some tofu. I wouldn't stand for it. ""I don't eat my tofu fried,"" I said, ""I eat my tofu raw!"" I grabbed the uncooked tofu and ripped its slippery flesh with my newly cleaned incisors. ""This is madness,"" she exclaimed. ""No,"" I said, ""this...is...tooooofuuuu!""By chance three of my friends from Ohio visited me that weekend. That Saturday the three of us met up with a friend of mine from Boston. He brought four people with him. ""You only brought three drinkers with you?"" he questioned. ""How many alcoholics do you have among you?"" I asked. Two Bostonians sheepishly raised their hands. ""O, H"" I yelled. To which my three friends replied ""I, O."" ""You see,"" I said, ""I brought more alcoholics than you.""At least that's how I pictured my life after seeing this movie. Too bad I just felt lethargic.300 is the story of Thermopylae, where three-hundred Spartans defended Greece against an onslaught of Persians. Of course, historically speaking, there were plenty of other Greeks and lots of help from the Athenian navy, but don't let history get in the way of a good yarn.The whole battle starts off from a little misunderstanding. A Persian messenger comes to King Leonidas and asks for him to pay tribute and bow before Xerxes. Well, apparently Spartans don't bow because the messenger finds himself looking for the bottom of a bottomless pit. Much of the dialogue is concerned with what Spartans do and do not. ""Spartans are this and Spartans are that."" It's all very boring. In fact, they should have replaced every word with variations on Sparta. ""Sparta Sparta Spartans. SPARTA!""Right now you're probably thinking to yourself, ""well, you already made fun of the historical inaccuracies and the dialogue, but I really just came to the movie for the action."" That's all fine and good except for the fact that even the action sucks. Sure, the choreography isn't too bad, but the film is almost entirely shot in slow motion. In fact, there's about a half-hour of film stretched out to two hours. I was waiting for the dialogue to be slowed down and the inevitable ""nooooooooooo"" but alas the film did not deliver. Slow motion should be used for emphasis, but when every action scene is in slow motion then it loses its impact. It's kind of like using a highlighter to highlight an entire book instead of just the great passages.There's also an inordinate amount of homoeroticism, which isn't a problem in and of itself, but the fact that the filmmakers seem absolutely unaware of it is rather odd. For example, Leonidas calls the Athenians ""boy lovers"" but then goes and greases himself up, puts on a Speedo, and then hangs out with 299 nearly naked greased up men. It's kind of like the pot calling the kettle black. Despite an attempt at showing a romantic relationship between Leonidas and his queen, the only convincing relationship is between the captain's son and the ""fight in the shade"" guy (I don't think we hear more than two or three names throughout the movie). I was barraged by a series of come hither glances and double entendre and halfway through the movie I wanted to tell the two to go get a room.I could continue and complain about lack of characterization, the inane queen plot, or some of the more laughable visual choices but what I really want to talk about is The Watchmen. A Watchmen film has been rumored for years and it seems that 300 director Zach Snyder has finally gotten his CGI obsessed hands on it. The Watchmen is the holy grail of comic books and was even chosen by Time as one of the all time greatest novels alongside The Grapes of Wrath and The Sound and the Fury. It's some heavy stuff with lots of post-modern implications and a questioning of superheroes in general. However, Snyder's handling of 300 has made it evident he does not have the intelligence to handle a Watchmen film.300 is pretty faithful to the comic book, but in one of the tiniest changes it betrays a complete misunderstanding of Frank Miller's intent. One of Snyder's more awkward visual is his attempt at tearing Ephialtes from the page and putting him on the screen. As expected, Ephialtes looks like a guy with lots of makeup and a fake humpback. It's almost Ed Woodesque. In both the comic and the movie Ephialtes explains that he was born as a Spartan but because of his malformation he was whisked away by his mother to avoid being cast off a cliff. Since that time his father raised him as a Spartan and taught him how to fight. Ephialtes implores Leonidas to allow him to join the Spartans in their battle but Leonidas explains that because of Ephialtes' physical shape he is unable to raise his shield high enough to protect the other Spartans in their famous Phalanx formation.This is where Snyder changes Miller's words and also shows he doesn't understand the complexities of a mostly undemanding comic book. In Miller's version Leonidas tells Ephialtes ""I can't use you"" and then turns his back as Ephialtes jumps off a cliff. In the film Leonidas suggests that Ephialtes carry the dead off the battlefield or take other non-combat jobs before he throws himself off a cliff. Later in the story it is Ephialtes who betrays the Spartans by showing Xerxes the pass that allows him to outflank their position. In Miller's version, if Leonidas, and by extension, Spartan society could have mustered the imagination to find a place in society for everyone, then they would never have been outflanked. While most of 300 the comic book exalts the Spartans, Miller still has the insight to slyly critique some of their shortcomings. Snyder completely misses this point, and while reading the comic probably wondered why Leonidas wasn't a little gentler to poor Ephialtes and decided to add the line about carrying the dead off the battlefield. This was a mistake. If Snyder isn't able to understand the slight complexities of 300 then there's no way he's going to understand the mass complexities of Alan Moore's Watchmen. The only hope is that Snyder keeps close enough to the source material that he stumbles upon some of Alan Moore's brilliance.300 was disappointing, but it was also an adaptation I wasn't expecting, or would have immediately thought ""hey, what a great property for film adaptation,"" but Watchmen is. I'll just have to keep telling myself that I'll always have the original no matter how badly Zack Snyder screws up the only graphic novel that matters."	2.0	For fans who like slow motion and lack irony.	2007-11-23	18	11	7

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ACM90BRKX73OG	Tom	300 (2007) is loosely based upon the legendary Battle of Thermopylae 480 B.C. in which the rear guard of the retreating Greek army, comprised of 300 Spartans and 1100 other Greek warriors, delayed the advancing Persian army for three days at a narrow coastal pass.This violent bloodfest is a testosterone cocktail that would appeal mainly to 18-year-old males and neo-fascists. The ultra-macho tenor of 300 borders on the comical. Great movie if you still pine for the glory of your high school locker room.	2.0	Hyper-Machismo	2014-01-24	1	0	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2U80IPZXN5V1U	Tommy Sixx Morais	"Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel(Sin City was also adapted to the big screen a few years ago),""300"" is a movie about glory,war and courage.This movie is more than your regular movie,it was done in such a beautifull and strong artistic way that you can't help but just be stunned by it.This is one of the most visually stunning experiences and it goes further than anything you've seen before.I admit that's saying quite a lot,but that's the truth.""300"" tells the story of the Spartan people and the thirst for defending their country.King Leonidas guided 300 Spartans to a march to glory.The Spartans had no other hope than to ""die beautifully for their country"" and fight until death would take them.There was only 300 Spartan and over a thousand Persians and there wasn't much hope,but they gave the Persians a great fight.While it isn't historically accurate and was never meant to be,300 remains impressive in its own right.300 doesn't have much of a story,it has one but it is quite simple : 300 Spartans making their last stand fighting for their land.I'm sure you've heard that a lot by now.It is an epic story about the ancient Grece and it makes a great hommage to the Spartan people.It shows how strong the Spartans were but also how only the strong ones were allowed to fight.In fact the babies were looked carefully for weaknesses,and if they had any they would kill them and only the strongest survived.Those who were kept alive were trained vigorously to fight and to not feel pain.They were and still are often talked about as ""barbarians"" and ignorants.I don't think 300 could have been done much better from a visual perspective,the novel was amazing and the movie is even more and done near flawlessly.From the first to the last scene this movie is a complete chef d'oeuvre(big words never hurt!).This is by far one of the purest movie today,not designed to give any judgements and it doesn't try to make you have an opinion,neither was it intended to be a box-office hit(well I say that but we never know)it's just amazing.King Leonidas(Gerald Butler is impressive and gives a truthfull and honnest performance of the character that can only impress you)chooses 3000 hundred Spartans to go to war and conquer the Perse territory make the glorious name of the Spartan a famous and respected one.With his army he will try to take the Persian people and their god Xerxes by surprise,wich failed.Yes there are more Persians and statistically the Spartans shall loose,but they won't until they have given all they've got and killed the last Persian.Its a true story of dedication and hope,the warrior code the Spartans had is respected in its entirety here even making us wonder if it really is true as it seems like too much.Historians will know right from the start that this ain't accurate history but will still love it for all the historical references and how they manage to make a great movie related to history.It is also interresting to see the power that the queens had and how they were respected,most of what you see in movies are slave females so it is nice to see one who has power.Troughout all of it,there is also love,friendship and betrayal of their country wich adds a more human touch.The Spartans seem not like average humans,but rather like gods in this film.Expect to see plenty of abbs and muscles in this movie as they fight bare-chest so you do have to see that quite often.The acting in the movie is quite convincing and is nothing to complain about,every actor does a great job here.The movie is mostly focused on visuals and the amazing battles it had rather than actual script.The battles are outstanding and very well executed with lots of action in them.Every battle is stunning and seems yet so realistic for a movie.That is one great thing about 300,it looks very real.Those fights seems to have a certain rythym alternating between fast and slow and at times slow motion to give some of the desired effects.There doesn't seem to be lots of computer effects but there are some,I'm just glad there isn't too much of it to the point that all it does is rely on those effects.There is more than one battle and many characters die,also there is a lot of violence and blood so now you know that not anyone can watch this.The final comfrontation and the ending remains touching and made the Spartans look proud of what they have achieved.To conclude,how can you not like this movie?You can but you can't deny that its is a piece of art and a fine masterpiece.There is something to like about it for everyone wheter it's the fight scenes,the impressive artistic result or the overral story.It reminds me a lot of the ""The Gladiator"" wich was similiar to 300 in some ways,but this is much more impressive.You have to admire the overral perspective and direction of 300.This 2-discs special edition also has plenty of extras,one disc full of them,many extras and some that are great to watch.You get your money's worth wether you buy this two discs special edition,single disc,widescreen,full screen : it's all good!Some videos on Youtube make fun of 300(this is sparta another techno remix is hilarious),but there is a movie called ""meet the spartans"" that makes fun of this as well.People may make fun of this but it remains gold.It follows a lot from the 1961 movie ""The 300 Spartans"" and it is interresting to compare with 300.A well-deserved five stars!"	5.0	This Is Madness!	2008-02-18	2	1	1

But if you like violence for the sake of violence, and I know some people do (like the person who recommended this to me), then this is for you.  But lots of violence does not make for a good movie, just a violent movie.  I cannot believe however that some people would compare this movie to the Matrix.  The Matrix is a great movie, with an incredible story line, and very intelligently thought out.  &#34;300&#34; is not that type of movie.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3U8KO0URI78U1	T. TENNANT	"An Epic Epoche to play on words. 300 was nothing short of breathtaking. You think this looks like a brainless testosterone driven film? Youre stark raving mad. The film begins with a narrative story of Leonidas upbringing, giving the viewer of feel of a Spartan warriors childhood. It takes a minute to show emotion, and then another to show sparta's traditionalism. Then, the show begins.Zach Snyders use of visual backgrounds, slow motion editing, and palette of colors is mindblowing to say the least. This beats out even his DOTD remake. If I were on the academy, I would definately nominate 300 for best cinematography. Hands Down. The script is wonderful, using just sentences to relay emotions. With spots of humor, the dialogue is amazing even using lines from the greek stories themselves. Such as ""Eat a hardy breakfast for tonight we dine in Hell""(Hades). The soundtrack did its part too. With a heavy tone that still hits you where it counts it also portrays the feelings of the Spartans when they as warriors cannot express them.Finally, the cast. Some parts may have been miscast by look.(Blondes werent that numerous in Greece), but not miscast by talent. Using recognizable faces but not over-exposed ""movie stars"" the cast was great. Props to all the men who trained to look so dang intimidating. But nobody, nobody measures up to Gerard Butler. I think a very underrated actor, Gerard made this movie. He was the apitome of brilliant in every scene. Having a seemingly obsessive lure to period films (Phantom of the Opera, Timeline, Attila) he was bound to get cast in this part. This part that he made his, in every way shape or form to make King Leonidas one of the 21st centuries best characters yet."	5.0	...utterly amazing....	2007-03-11	12	6	6
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	Loosely based upon Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name, 300 is a retelling of the story of the 300 Spartans who withstood against the invading Persian army of King Xerxes at the Battle of Thermopylae.  I have never read Miller's comic so I am unsure as to how closely the movie follows the comic, but the film opens with a prelude explaining what happened to Spartan men from the time they were born until the time the become men.  The prelude tells of King Leonidas' experiences alone in the wild and how he faced a giant wolf in wild and defeated it single handedly by trapping it in a tight place.  After the prelude the action moves to the city of Sparta before the war against the Persians began.  King Xerxes has sent an emissary to Sparta to King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) to see if the Spartans will surrender their city to Persian control.  If they do so, they are promised self-control, but as stewards and vassals to Xerxes.  Leonidas responds by kicking the emissary down what appears to be a bottomless well and it is made clear that things don't look well for Sparta.As King, Leonidas goes to the Oracle to seek their blessing and any possible advice, but he instead finds corruption.  The Oracle guardians won't allow the Spartan army to leave until after the upcoming religious festival.  Leonidas won't be deterred; he knows that the future of Sparta and of all Greece depends on meeting the Persians in combat and keeping them at bay as long as possible.  Of course, being a Spartan he's also looking for a fight because it's been a long time.  So, in the Spartans go.  In this version of the tale they are joined by a handful of Greeks from other cities who don't fight much and spend most of their time on the sidelines watching the Spartans plow through the Persian ranks.  Despite being out numbered over 100 to 1, for awhile it appears that the Spartans might have a chance.  But, then a traitor, Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan), tells Xerxes about a secret pass where he can surround the Spartans.  After that there's not much left except death and glory.The Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae is an inspiring tale, but I was worried that since 300 is based on a work by Frank Miller (an author who has become famous for his nihilistic world view exposed largely through comic books), that it would be sapped of any inspiration and left hopeless in the end.  I was surprised to find that this isn't the case with 300.  Don't get me wrong, 300 is a dark and violent film.  It has all kinds of Miller touches from turning the traitorous goat shepherd of history, Ephialtes, into a deformed hunchback of Spartan birth to the giant monsters employed by the Persian army.  There's plenty of gore and titillating scenes of nudity to appeal to the teenage boys who will be eager to watch.  The film also gets a few jibes in at religion. Yet, those things are just extras.  The real story itself remains largely intact.  The honor of the Spartans, the bravery they displayed, and the legacy they left to Greece and the rest of the Western World is not distilled.  In fact, 300 is perhaps the most hopeful of all of Miller's works.  Instead of ending at the Battle of Thermopylae, the story has an epilogue that concludes the tale at the Battle of Plataea where the Greeks decisively beat the Persian army and sent them out of their country for good.The movie is a visual feast of cinematography.  The filmmakers followed a technique that gained prominence with SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.  The entire film was filmed on blue and green screens.  Therefore, almost all of the visuals were created by computers (the bulging muscles of the Spartan warriors are a few of the exceptions--those are real and the actors underwent an intensive six-week course to prepare themselves).  The color palette and overall visual look of the film is breathtaking.  Turn the sound out and cut out most of the action scenes and 300 would still be a stunning work of art.There's not much to say in regards to acting.  No one makes a stand out performance; though Gerard Butler makes a good Leonidas (Scottish actors portray royalty well).  Besides the story itself and the overall look of the film, the next thing that stands out are the battles.  The battles are well choreographed and take their cue from a wide variety of modern action films, such as THE MATRIX and THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  The battle scenes don't break any new ground, but they help make this the type of film such as BRAVEHEART and GLADIATOR that men will watch over and over and over again.I enjoyed 300.  It may not set any new ground and the story is as old as Western civilization, but it's a grand story, one that doesn't grow tired in the retelling no matter how many times you've heard or seen it.	4.0	"""Give them nothing!

Without it, 300 would just be another hollywoodized comic adaptation.  The fact that Frank Miller was so picky, saved the original concept of the graphic novel.  Some history buffs have concerns with the film, but that's because it's a graphic novel with some faint connections to history.  I don't watch this film as a documentary. No! This film is about the amazing personalities of 300 men.  It is an inspiration to all of us warrior out there fighting to succeed in life, metaphorically.But anyway, besides all that mess, 300 is an atom bomb of new stylized action.  I totally agree with the review that stated something like ""it is the new matrix,"" because it is really a groundbreaking film.  The slow-mo/fast-mo action scenes are incredible and should be appreciated for their quality.  Zack Snyder did not miss his shot on any scene.  Word for word, and stab for stab this movie is beautiful.Speaking of words, Frank Miller is one of the most incredible dialogue creators of all time.  When people say ""there's too much talking and storyline in this movie"" that's because most films don't fill the gap between action with powerful dialogue.  Action films must have balance.  300 has balance like the spear-throwers that stand poised within the battles.So we have an excellent script and source.  We have testosterone-injected action.  What else do we need? The movie cannot survive without a great cast.  Gerald Butler, Lena Headey, Dominic West, David Wenham, and Vincent Regan all could not have been easily replaced.  This is not because of their individual efforts, but because of their connection as a whole to the material.  They all had the same gleam in their eye that convinced me that they were there, when really they were in front of a green screen the whole time.  Gerald Butler has earned the medal of one of the best action stars of all time.  He deserves so much more credit and he needs a role besides a P.S. I Love you romantic.Some people don't bother with reviews because of their length.  I know I've done it too.  So I will make it short and sweet.  Frank Miller's graphic novels will always make amazing movies if he is involved.  If you enjoyed this film you must also see SIN CITY.  These two films are a couple in my favorite movies of all time. If you love action, then see the mother of all hack-slashing, spine-tingling, and heart-pounding films.  300 is a classic of our time."	5.0	One of the Most Epic Films of all Time!

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A7GSGC0G8R6PW	Tyler Tanner	First off, I love the movie and have watched it more times than I care to admit. It's a perfect blend of action and artistic creativity. Those who are looking for historical accuracy need to look eslewhere. But if you, like me, have a strong desire to pick up Herodotus after seeing the film, then it's an added bonus from watching it.The Standard Def 2 disc DVD holds up well, and has sated my appetite for watching the movie at leisure. But it has left this mere commoner in the lower end of the tax bracket to wonder what I am missing by watching the Blu-ray. The commentary by director Zach Snyder, the writer and the cinematographer keep mentioning little details that you would be seeing if you were watching it in Hi-def. Namely Persians hanging on the the ropes of the ships during the storm sequence. The commentary itself is okay. Not the best and not the worst. I probobably won't need to use that feature again, but glad I did at least once. Also, a heads up: On disc one I found an Easter Egg. Go to special features where you would activate the commentary and press up. A blood spatter will appear and then press enter. It will take you to an interesting short clip about the pre-productio process of the film, featuring Frank Miller and the pre-vis pitch that convinced WB the make the film. I liked that this easter egg was an actual feature instead of a three second blooper bit of an actor making a funny face which is normally what I find.Disc #2 has some neat features as well, but again leaves me to wonder what I am missing with the Blu-ray version.The first feature: 300 Spartans - Fact or Fiction, is the longest and shows the historical differences from what you see in the film. As well as interviews with the filmmakers, this has two historians who obviously like the film but politley separate it from fact.Next is Who were the Spartans? And concentrates more on the Spartan culture. Again you have filmmakers and historians. I liked both of these features the best.The third is called The Frank Miller Tapes and it's a nice little homage to the author of the graphic novel on which the film is based. I've grown up reading Miller and am glad that his work is now coming into the mainstream, so thumbs up on that one too.The Making of 300 left much to be desired. Maybe I'm spoiled, but I like watching the casting and the post-production process. Here they have just the meat of the filming and it's a bit too short in my opinon.300 in images is by far the weakest feature. It's a rapid-fire of photo's from start to finish. Epileptics should avoid this one. It's obviously a filler and something you would not want to see again.In the additional scenes, I can see why they cut what they did. Short and not really interesting save for the last scene.The last is the webisodes: Ah! this where most of the meat is. Three to five minute snippets concentrating on things like the costumes, training and the like. Surprisingly, I became a Lena Headly fan after watching these. Very down to earth and makes me look forward to her next film.Anyway, those are my thoughts and I hope they help. I'm glad I got the DVD. It not a definitive version by any means, but there is some good stuff here to tide me over until I make the leap to Blu-ray. Certainly better than some of the other Special Edition DVD's that are out there.	4.0	Review of the standard-def 2 disc special edition DVD	2008-04-19	3	2	1
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A7C9ZE791UYBW	"T. Zeisset ""Tim Z"""	I put off seeing this movie for about two or three years.  I'm a history buff, an am familiar with the record of events at Thermopylae. This homo-erotic hollywood version of the fighting and battle follows the basic story line, and has some historical fact loosely translated into what you see on the screen.  Not a bad message, gets the main point of a handful of Soldiers defiantly challenging an enemy of superior strength.As long as you don't get too wrapped up in the lack of historical accuracy, such as uniforms, battle gear, historical figures, etc., then you should be fine.  Accept it as a piece of entertainment that loosely tells a story.  Read about the battle of Thermopylae first, or after watching the movie, but know that the movie is a highly dramatized hollywood version of an actual historically important event.	4.0	300	2009-04-10	0	0	0

It is based on the Frank Miller graphic novel/comic book and that is exactly what it is. It is full of steroided up beefcake and exagerated characters doing 'super deeds'. They spout jingoistic ultra patriotic jargon and all the villians are portrayed as either monsters or evil super villians.I found the movie entertaining but I don't think it is a great history lesson or anything like that.

He is a great narrator and imaginative story teller. One thing that the brave men who decide to tackle his storys for film know is that they cannnot mold it to the likings of cinema. When Sin City was brought to the big screen I was amazed at how the story was told page for page narritive to action sequence. The breakthrough green screen filming is what totally did it for Frank Miller's story and now it was time to bring another of his masterpieces to the big screen.300 is such an incredible specticle. The story is brilliant as well as the cast. The bullet time fighting sequences are mind blowing. In all of its gore and glory you can't look away and anything that is placed in front of your eyes. This is a movie that you might not get the same thrill of through DVD alone.

Action-wise it was pretty cool, though I couldnt help but notice similaries to certain other films (ahem, LOTR, ahem). The Effects were top notch.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A35L2E8M7S59MQ	V. Berk	"300 was a huge success, due largely in part to the splendid CGI backgrounds and limitless display of bloodshed.  I was caught up in its success for several months before I watched it a few more times asking ""is it really that good?""  Although it will appeal to fans of the graphic novel, and mainstream action moviegoers when you pick it apart on a critical level you'll see how it fails to compare to other epics based on similar time periods.  In no way those this rock `em sock `em action joy ride hold a light to such films as Spartacus or Gladiator or any other of the notable films of this period in time.  I can see how this works as a graphic novel, but the same style just can't come across as excellence on screen.My biggest complaint has to be the poor dialogue in this film, which can only be described as taunts you'd typically see inside a wrestling stadium, characters allows shouting at the top of their lungs.  The things they say lack charisma, it just seems very unreal.If you want a real representation of this point in history go looking for another film, but if you want a great visual feast of gore and mayhem (like I am when I sit down to watch this film every now and then) then this film is perfect, especially when you're angry.A good 3 out of 5 stars for 300 for visuals, but lack of dialogue and other key items missing from the script."	3.0	300 - Visual spectacular gore fest	2008-08-19	4	3	1

They are available from Amazon and are much better. Spartans were very proud fighters and were extremely proud of their armor. They didn't fight half naked without their breastplates. Zerkes didn't have a bunch of pearls and such hanging off his face and didn't go around half naked either. The Greeks and Persians were proud people.

Those early Spartans were brave souls, yes they were.  I can see it now....King Leonidas lowering his beefy frame into the dentist's chair...the dentist puts a vacuum tube in the King's mouth to suck up the spit and asks the King if he wants novocaine....Leonidas rears up and roars through his spittle, ""THISHSH ISSHHH SHPARTAAAHHH!!!!""And that's not all the brave Spartans from this film underwent to tell us this tale of courage.  They were waxed, too, and I can tell you, folks, waxing hurts.  In my reckless youth, I spent a few consenting adult moments with gentlemen of the Greek persuasion, and they are a hirsute race, I guarantee you.  But not these Spartans, no siree.....not a one of them went before the camera with a spot of hair on his body. 300 full-body wax jobs....now that is truly brave.I saw this movie in the theatre and then rented it to watch again at home.

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1C80B497LCYKA	"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark"""	"While the Battle of Thermopylae is one of the ancient wonders of military history, and King Leonidas (who led the Greeks against the Persians) is one of the great military heroes of all time, the producers of the film 300 decided that wasn't good enough, and that they could improve upon the story. I don't agree with that. Frankly, I think their departure from history takes away from the story's impact. Making it a fantasy adventure, and the soldiers super heroes, takes away from the real people and the real event.According to the facts, Leonidas led a contingent of 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians against a Persian army numbering in the 100's of thousands, if not several millions. But, as if the facts weren't enough, Frank Miller (author of the graphic novel upon which the film is based) and director Zack Snyder decided to tell the story, not as a Greek heroic epic, which it most certainly is; but as a dark, Nordic tale in the tradition of Beowulf. Why they did this would be a good question for an interview or a psychiatrist's couch. The extra features really don't reveal this.So, intermingling the incredible facts as we know them from Herodotus and others, we have other darker elements:  like a decadent and diseased priesthood, mutant man-creatures, super-size rhinos and elephants, dark nights with Wagnerian moons, decapitations and other bloody aberrations that even the most gothic of writers would envy. There is nothing of the happy, sun-drenched countryside of Mediterranean Greece here.The Spartans had a severe warrior culture that demanded discipline and abstinence from the corrupting arts and vices of other Greeks. They were also very practical people who steered away from the complicated religious and mystical thinking of cultures to the east. They were a very honest, outdoor people that were taught to tell the truth from an early age. So, to include corruption and intrigue on the scale presented here misrepresents the straightforward simplicity that was Sparta.Nevertheless, as misplaced as some of these elements are historically, and as strange and disturbing as the film is at times conceptually, it is interesting both visually and cinematically. We have never seen anything like this before. Most of it was created via blue screen and computer, much like Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow. But it goes far beyond Sky Captain, because Miller has created a powerful vision in his novel that holds Snyder's film together and gives it a look. To say that it is graphic is an understatement. It is quite handsome. It is also quite sensual, and is a study in flesh as well as blood, both of which are shown quite prominently.Storywise, 300 is over the top:  a cross between sci-fi thriller and military epic. It is narrated for us by David Wenham (Dilios), Leonidas' second-in-command, the man Leonidas sends back to report their heroic deeds to the Council, and the man who eventually leads the Greek army back against the Persians after the 300 have fallen. It would have been nice if the filmmakers had opened with Dilios speaking before the Council, so that we knew who the narrator was in the beginning.Leonidas, who is introduced to us as he teaches his son to fight, is played super-heroically by Gerard Butler (Phantom Of The Opera, Dear Frankie). I cannot imagine another actor in this role. Butler has pumped himself up to football linebacker size and bodybuilder cut. But more than his look, he conducts himself as a hands-on military leader who knows how to inspire his men to ""do their duty,"" so that we believe he truly is Leonidas. There have never been more ferocious looks on screen, with his white teeth and whites-of-his-eyes gleaming from beneath his helmet. As the perfect action hero who can also act, he has taken his career to the level of stardom with this one.Also memorable are Lena Headey as Leonidas' gorgeous wife Gorgo (appropriate name) and Rodrigo Santoro as the affected king-who-would-be-god Xerxes. Which brings up another point:  art direction. It, too, is over-the-top. Persian art is very well documented. There are even statues of King Xerxes, so we know very well how he looked in an official capacity. But all that seems to have been ignored in this film. Again, it is a departure from historical fact; but the departure is quite interesting.There are very many elements in 300 that are unsuitable for children of any age, most women and men who are squeamish. Like Apocalypto the previous year, this is a ground-breaking film, but it is not for everyone. I love the slow-motion fight sequences; but there is a glorification of violence in the idea of violence as art which many viewers, including myself, do not accept. And there are several sexually explicit scenes that don't add anything to the story.The bottom line is, this film will never be more than a cult classic because it doesn't allow us into the story. I think that is the weakness of a film shot almost entirely on blue screen. As a theatrical piece and as cinematic art, it is memorable. But as drama, it won't hold up over time. The extra features on the two-disc special edition support this view. The filmmakers were willing to sacrifice everything for the fantasy look of Frank Miller's graphic novel. You can't do that and end up with a great film. You need a certain level of reality for most adults to relate to a film. And when you have history that is already great drama, why sacrifice it, especially for a fantasy look? It doesn't make sense.Waitsel Smith"	4.0	VISUALLY HANDSOME, OVER-THE-TOP SCI-FI EPIC	2007-08-05	6	3	3

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2XOS0D485JSMM	webhawk50	300 is another highly faithful graphic novel adaption of Frank Miller's, the first being Sin City.  Sin City became one of my favorite movies of all time, but 300 fell far short of that mark and barely made a &#34;3&#34; star rating from me.  I give it 3 stars primarily because of it's incredible CG work and the fact that despite it's general lack of a good script and poor dialogue, it still entertained me and kept me watching until the end.  With so many incredibly bad movies out there these days, that is no small feat.  I am highly inclined to simply shut movies off after about 20 minutes or so if I feel that they are so insulting to one's intelligence that they don't deserve to be watched.  So, while 300 is far less than a sterling movie, it at least had some basic entertainment value for me, which is not a bad thing.  However, I find movies like this with such constant over-the-top gore and fighting and destruction to get tedious in the extreme and that's primarily what this film delivers in abundance.	3.0	Just squeaks in as a 3 star movie	2012-12-25	0	0	0

I believe there are only 3 movies that are perfectly made in the history of films which are, Gone with the Wind, Lord of the Rings and 300.In overall perspective and theme of the movie, this film just totally rocks and is a hardcore excellent film.1. The script is spectacularly amazing, effective and full of impact. It not only is true to the original comic but it captures effectively the characters, the mood, the theme.2. The visuals are fantastic... the film is enhanced with the digital, artsy-comic style embedded in the movie. I am not a big fan of fully CGI movies, but this one SHOULDN'T be made NOT digital. The look of the movie is stunning in itself, surrealistic (as it should be) and very modern.3. The direction by Zack Snyder was amazing and I was in all honesty blown away by his style. Very unique, very effective, just astoundingly above the standards of hollywood directors. He perfects commercialism combined with artful discretion. It is perfection. A single scene even without dialogue speaks more about the background of Spartans, whatever that scene needed to tell than a movie full of words.4. Cheorography is not to be underestimated. Unlike most action war battle scenes in most commercial movies, the fight scenes in 300 are not chaotic, effortlessly (or so it would seem to the audience) beautiful and effectively captures the strength, the weakness, the inevitable force of the film.5. THERE ARE FEW WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE WAY THIS MOVIE HAS RAISED THE BAR IN HOLLYWOOD FILMS, and those words I cannot find the most fitting for 300, because this movie is just sooo overwhelming beautiful and perfected in a way that a small budget film (that it is) can ever achieve. We will be hard pressed to find a movie to match this one.WATCH IT, BUY IT and you will NOT have regrets!The second disc contains many featurettes, deleted scenes and behind the scenes although honestly i couldnt get enough of them.	5.0	Why 300 is a 5-Star Movie	2007-08-23	4	3	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3762LB4P78A09	William	Some good friends of ours asked if we would join them at the cinema as they were at a Head Teachers conference that day, and I also had to go to London which I had been putting off for several weeks. When we entered we were directed to our pre-booked seats. At this point everything seemed fine the staff were great, smiling and pleasant, I thought this would be a nice opportunity to ask the usher if he would take a photograph of the four of us sat in our row to which he replied &#34;I haven't time at the moment I am serving ice cream&#34;. This was embarrassing to me as well as our friends at the people behind us had just made the same request to another usher to which he obliged straight away taking only seconds. As I glanced back at them and they just raised their eyebrows I think they felt embarrassed for us.There were a lot of inconsistencies like this throughout. Towards the end of the movie we left the seats to go our coats and umbrellas from the cloakroom only to find they had lost my umbrella. I asked them to find it and all I got was blank faces and raised eyebrows. When I went back to the lobby my friends had started to put their coats on and it soon became noticeable that one of the ushers was following us around with a portable popcorn dispenser and as we were getting ready to leave the lobby for the steps we notcied he was tagging on behind. It was slightly intimidating so I politely declined his offer on the grounds that the movie had ended but he just stared at me.Once all that was over I asked another usher to order us a taxi which they said that they didn't do which came as a big surprise to me, so we went outside to what can only be described as a bun fight to get a taxi... no real queue just who ever manages to get one flagged down first... really disorganised. Anyway we managed to get back to Kings Cross with 15 minutes to spare. On my return home the next day I rang the cinema to discuss my umbrella to which they were very obtuse and treated my complaint with disinterest... all in all a poor day and an experience which I will not recommend.I have been to cinemas all over Europe and the Middle East and had far better service, and they have never lost any of my property.	4.0	Some good friends of ours asked if we would join them ...	2014-07-11	0	0	0

Kelsey ""seeker of truth"""	"Instead, it is a feast for the eyes and the ears with a fantastic cast, great soundtrack, and probably the best visuals of the new millennium. I know, I know, for about 10% of the male population (and about 90% of the chickies out there) this will be basically porn: the best bodies this side of the WWE, pumped and oiled, wearing little more than leather thongs, but Gerald Butler's amazing dramatic abilities (along with a great supportive cast) take this film from the B level cheese fest that was the very sorry ""Troy"" and turn their tale into true art. The dialogue is very solid and strong (almost ""Braveheart"" like, which is a very high compliment), and while there are surely many embellishments, the main story stays pretty close to history. Personnally, while I admire the Spartans for their heroic stand, their culturally blessed child abuse (which the film barely touches upon) completely disgusts me and I couldn't get that completely out of my mind when watching this film where they are obviously supposed to be the living embodiment of a free society. However, as I had said before, the scenery is great, the story is deeply moving, and if the US army had any sense they would use this as a way of inspiring young would be recruits rather than that lame ""Army of One"" slogan."	5.0	"In Lesser Hands, This Could Had Been ""Troy"""	2007-08-10	3	2	1

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	Dont go much to pictures. Costs too much and most aint worth seein. But this one looked pretty good. Lots a tuff guys that didnt take crap off a nobody. Had an awful lot a muscles. Only time I see so many six packs is when I go to 7-11.The storys sposed to be true. The Persia king invades Greece to make the people slaves. The Sparta men dont like that and decide to fight even though they know there gonna lose. I couldnt figure why the Sparta king talked like that guy who played James Bond.The Persia king is a [bundle of sticks] or I dont know one when I see one. Alma Jr says Persia is Iran. I guess the movies sayin the guy runnin Iran is a [bundle of sticks]. I figger that makes the Sparta men Americans.Theres a lot of fightin and a lot a blood flyin ever which way. The fightin got me boilin. It reminded me a how Jack and I wrestled. I had real strong dreams about Jack for a coupla weeks.When the Sparta boy got his head cut off I wanted to stomp the Persia guys into the ground. Made me think a Jack gettin beat with a tire iron. Hadnt thought a that in a long time.The Sparta men lose but they figure they really won because they stood up for what was right. Cant argue with that. I liked it when the Sparta king said he woulda died for any of his men.Alma Jr knows a lot a things. I ask her Did the Sparta men... You know...? She says shell look it up. Coupla days later she tells me.Sparta kept the men away from the women, and workin at being good soldiers, until it was time to get married. So the older guys had sex with the younger guys until the older ones got hitched. And they wore leather armor when they fought -- no little briefs, and definitely no capes.That helps partly but it makes me think of another question Im scared to ask. Did they have... boyfriends? My face turns red.Alma Jr looks at me real sweet and says No probly not. All they did was fight. And when they werent fightin they trained really hard. Hardly had time to love their wives let alone each other. But they loved their country. And they loved each other as friends. And they died for each other.I remember Alma Jr tellin Cassie she didnt think I was the marryin kind. She must a known all along. Its been 25 years but this is the first shes let on she knows.I want to cry. Dont want Alma Jr to see me but cant hold back. Shes a grandma but she sits in my lap and puts her arms around my neck and cries too. I wish Id met him she says. He must have been a wonderful person for you to have loved him so much. Alma Jr must a seen the shirts and postcard sometime.She dont know what a coward I was. If Id a been brave and stood by Jack like the Sparta men did for each other, we woulda had our little operation and Jack wouldna got killed.Damn how I wish Jack was still here.

Those men have more chest than Lena Heady and other women in the film. That being said, doesn't mean that the film doesn't have other attractions. Compare to Frank Miller's Sin City, 300 is obviously more violent and lavish in production, even though I know most of the landscapes and sets are CGI. The film is pure thrill and it's very popcorn entertainment. There is very little dialogue once the actions start to take over as the main ""sell"" of the show. As a matter of fact, I found the dramatic non battle scenes to be inadequate or weak for a period movie. Still, the film continue to be a captivating experince with so much bloody and gruesome fight scenes with monsters and imortals. I am used to seeing the over-the-top Hong Kong kung fu movies, so the fight scenes here came across as dull but it's intended to be as realistic as it was meant to be. I was constantly trying to pay attention to Gerard Butler's performance. He's very good at delivering all those very macho and angry expressions and his battle scenes are pretty convincing. At times, all those 8-packs and bulging chests effortlessly stole the show. I was very impressed with the visuals overall, and some of the makeup and wardrobe were quite amazing, especially those piercings all over Rodriguez Santoro who played the Persian King. Too bad he didn't even get to do any fighting,'cause his appearance is so striking but brief screentime. I was not familiar with the comic book, so the ending was a bit dissatisfying in a way. I couldn't help myself comparing Butler's look and performance to Russell Crowe in Gladiator. I think he's far more appealing physically, but the role is limited in dramatic range than Crowe's."	4.0	So much blood and guts and a load of beefcakes!	2007-03-09	10	6	4

The truth is that Spartan society left nothing behind but stories of its vicious battles. No art, no knowledge, no invention, nothing to enlighten the future men came from Sparta- only the clash of arms and violence. Sparta was overwhelmed in the end by an outside world Spartans couldn't even begin to understand because of their culture's innate xenophobia and hatred. That so-called Spartan courage had no impact on the Persian army. The Persians took losses, but kept right on down the Greek coast to Athens and burned it in one piece. What stopped the Persians was the subterfuge of Themistocles and the Athenian navy at the naval battle of Salamis which was quite a small loss for Persia.As for ""the whole of Spartan society,"" what else is there to say? Sparta was a totalitarian and aristocrat community well over 20 centuries before the term was even invented, suppressing a vast helotry. (It also systematized homosexuality to a degree unknown in any other society) And, again, it created nothing to enlighten men who would come after- which is exactly what is meant by culture, no?"	1.0	a historically stupid movie intended for low IQ morons	2009-05-22	21	3	18

He's sown a few seeds of fact and reaped a huge harvest of entertainment, so his result may resemble history as much as an oak tree resembles the acorn that it developed from. Fine. I can live with that. On the way home from seeing it, I listened to a radio commentator who couldn't. That's fine too.300 succeeds completely as a comic brought to the screen. It's big, bold, and bloody. (Very bloody, so decide whether that's what you want to see.) It has mighty heroics, and not just among the warriors. Even Queen Gorgo has her enemies, battles to fight, and sacrifices to make, though they differ in kind. The movie really finds itself in the larger-than-life scenes of war, though.That's where the effect-meisters truly bring the comic alive. Bejewelled Xerxes towers, Leonidas thunders, giants hew, gore splatters, and micreants skulk. Vistas are vast, and armies swarm. Mighty (if shallow) visions of valor come thick and fast. It's a grand spectacle, driven by comic-book concepts of might and manliness.

The movie itself is recommended for a fun two hours. Don't expect any thought-provoking concepts or historical accuracy.The HD DVD contains a good copy of the film. I hadn't noticed any glaring flaws with the disc. The film contains much film grain, though I am sure that is from the film.	4.0	Entertaining, Good Disc	2012-08-15	0	0	0

B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AE9GUE3HHOX3U	zooni	Quick movie synopsis:  A bunch of angry, alpha male, insecure and inadequate white boys who weren't hugged enough by their mothers hating life and eachother, spreading their germ of hate across the world for some quick power and ego boosting. Ug Ug ooga ooga bang on your chest and find a cliff.  I wish all these macho fools would just shut up and go have a good cry under a palm tree.  Who finds this crap entertaining, probably the lowest common denominator of a human being?  And why bother using live action, 300 looked like a cartoon.  A mess of a movie for the planet of the apes.	1.0	A Hate Affair	2007-12-06	20	8	12
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A16PMCVYGHPB91	Z. Robbins	"Its 300 in all its glory on the best format available.  On a 42"" 1080p Aquos it doesn't get any better.  Amazon is awesome too.  First copy I ordered went to the wrong house (thanks UPS!).  Amazon gladly shipped me another one next day and refunded me all shipping costs.  This is why amazon will always be the first place I shop."	5.0	300 at its best.	2007-09-30	0	0	0

I like the spartons & the king spartus. well frank miller is good at movies like that. And the backgrounds of the movie is not okay for my knowledge. Comparing with ""Sin City"" this movie is far away from it.Anyhow I loved this movie only a little. The best parts are the action sequences. the way the blood spreads around everywhere is fantastically done. Good special effects though.ZT"	3.0	This is history!!!	2007-09-02	0	0	0
B00005JPLW	300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3A06H5L6MPXIF	"Z ""Zizzy"""	I absolutely love this movie! When I first heard about it I thought it might be dumb. But then people started talking about it and saying how good it was, so I looked it up and saw that there were some not very good scenes in it. So I was skeptical but decided to try it. And it's awesome! It goes at a very nice pace, not too fast so you don't know what's happening, and not too slow so you get bored. The bad scenes are really not too bad. It's just an overall great movie. I think it would appeal to a broad range of audience who is of course into the war theme. The visual effects were spectacular. I couldn't believe it was done all on green screen. It's a very captivating movie and many would enjoy it.	5.0	Great movie!	2007-12-20	2	2	0
