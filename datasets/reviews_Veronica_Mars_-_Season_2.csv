B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	AB7J4881WKCHY	A. Butler	After the fantastic first season it must have been a tough job to try and match it, much less top it. I give the writers credit for pulling out all the stops in the attempt. But not... quite.While the plotting is still up to par and the twists and turns have a familiar flavor, I thought that the second season failed to maintain the magic balance of short and long term arc development that made VM's first year such a magnificent achievement. It's still very entertaining, and every VM season towers above the best seasons of most current shows.	5.0	Second Best Season	2014-02-26	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3NAFKSNYT703O	"Agent seven ""007"""	Veronica Mars is one fo the best shows ever,just ask Joss Whedon! The Second season has even more twists and turns than the first season ,Veronica  matures as she awaits the trial for her friend's death. The season opener starts with a bus crash which becomes the main focus of the season,which is solved in the season finale (you'll never guess who blew up the bus)! This season introduces new characters (kendall casablancas and the shady mayor goodman)and loses old ones(Duncan)  Way better than the first season by far.*can't wait for season three on the CW*	5.0	One of the best shows ever!!!!!!	2006-07-03	6	6	0
B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	AORXL977W3KI7	Aging  Boomer	"The first season of ""Veronica Mars"" was refreshingly free of politically correct cant.  The second season continues the first season's fine acting and production values, but the scripts, alas, are much more conventionally ""Hollywood"" than those of the first season.  Race, class, religion and sex get the standard Left Coast treatment; there is even an inept homage to ""Twelve Angry Men"" in which wise Hispanic and black jurors (and, needless to say, Veronica) overcome prejudiced middle-class whites.  The lowest blow is the depiction of Meg Manning's Christian parents.  I'm only halfway through Season 2 on DVD, but I half expect it will turn out that the Mannings blew up the bus.  Of course, in Hollywood's view, to be a believing Christian is per se to be a neurotic, sexually repressed, child-abusing, life-hating menace.  And guess what, that's what Meg's parents are!  They lock their youngest daughter in a closet after making her write ""The path to God is paved with righteousness"" hundreds of times. (How these folks raised such a nice girl as Meg is unclear.)  In typical fashion, these characters are never described as ""Christians,"" only as ""religious.""  Hollywood is arrogant but not courageous; it likes plausible deniability.  But the Mannings show little resemblance to Jews or Muslims; it's not hard to guess the precise nature of their ""religiosity"".  I hope, when he's a bit older, to watch this show with my son, and explain how it illustrates the bigotry and prejudice with which those of our faith are depicted by the Rob Thomases of the world.  Then perhaps I'll also explain to him how the path to God is indeed paved with righteousness, both Christ's and (imperfectly) ours.  Take that, Veronica Mars."	1.0	Unfortunate descent into Christian-bashing	2006-09-04	109	10	99
B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"Sleuthing teen outwits both adults and intellects alike, while continually maintaining the highest GPA at Neptune High?  Is this feasible?  For those unfamiliar with this series would probably shrug this off as being just another colorful pre-teen drama that explores impossibility and stretches both the intelligence and believability of the viewer.  As an avid first season watcher (twice watched continuously all the way through), I am here to tell inform those reading this that Veronica Mars is possibly the most genuine, well written, developed television series to be released in years.  It has that potential to even out-impress the network poster-program Lost.  From the extended openings that pull you into each episode willingly or unwillingly, completely to the end of the episode that makes you salivate for more or question the theories that are rummaging through your mind, Veronica Mars (in this critics eyes) is the best that television has to offer.  Wit, charm, engrossing storylines, and characters that leave us with a craving for more is just scratching the surface of this program.  I began this series with mediocre expectations, but came out a die-hard fan.  While this second season boasted more complexity, I still found myself back at home in a little California town called Neptune.To begin, I need to get out into the open that I loved both released DVD seasons of Veronica Mars to the utmost extent.  I thought both brought a strong and epic struggle between evil and good to a small town in America, but I must admit there are some vast differences between the first and second season that may sour some avid viewers.  The second season is less tight with its storyline, yet somehow (and not to be too confusing) more complex.  It is obvious that creator Rob Thomas had a bigger idea than what the season would allow, OR he is building upon the idea that the third season would be further complex thus needing two full seasons to completely develop each and every storyline.  I only mention this because the only gripe I have of season two is the huge leaps and bounds that some stories seem to take.  Without giving too much away, the Duncan Kane story seemed too big for just the season alone, the underdeveloped Kendall Casablancas' story that was interesting but needed more, or the entire Dick/Cassidy story that teetered on a more sinister note than what we were shown in this season.  There was quite a bit happening in season two that left unfinished while the bigger story about the bus seemed to be a smaller piece than what it needed to be.  Alas, I guess that is what happens when you try to outgrow from the first, most amazing, opening season ever!I wanted to get that out of the way because it was the only issue that I had with this season of Veronica Mars.  The characters are what keep you coming back for more and more in this illustrious television series, and this second season doesn't let you down.  The development of the brother due, Bea...I mean Cassidy and Dick Casablancas was phenomenal.  Like I mentioned before, there is a darker story happening here and I hope that it only grows with the third season.  I enjoyed the development of our characters further.  I loved seeing Veronica struggle with both the pressures of high school as well as solving the mini-crimes around the neighborhood.  I loved the fact that for a couple of episodes in this season we obviously paid homage to Twin Peaks (doesn't every television show?) with a sinister development of the parents of Neptune.  Again, I think we are growing into a darker story that may erupt with season three ... mark my word.  I also enjoyed the newfound celebrity involvement with this second season.  Kevin Smith, Joss Wheton, Steve Guttenberg, ""The Todd"" from Scrubs, and even Harry Hamlin was back in full swing.  It just created a richer atmosphere for the show.  It was as if they had taken the strong elements of the first season, developed further, and brought us a superb contrast between characters and story.  It was a strong blend that needed to happen for this second season, and while we may have lost audiences due to the complexity (as well as if you missed an episode in this season you missed quite a bit), I think it pulled together well.  I just think we will be stronger satisfied with the third season.Overall, even with the slight downfalls mentioned above, I thought Veronica Mars did a fabulous job of uniting us with old friends and new acquaintances.  This is a powerful show that continues to be both (I apologize) fast and furious.  The writing is immaculate; Veronica's use of wit and language is amazing.  It is a show that forces you to become involved with what is happening, not just sit and be a viewer.  Veronica Mars pulls you deeply into the world of Neptune and will put a smile on your face while challenging your mind.  Up until the very end, you may have an idea of the truth, but until it is revealed, you are left with only ""I think...I think...I think"".  This show is pure brilliance and needs to be continued throughout many seasons to come.

After 3 episodes i was hooked and i watched the entire season in 3 days.  Since finishing season 1 i couldnt wait for the release of season 2.  It just arrived yesterday and im halfway through the season.  This season is full of surprises.This season deals with the aftermath of the lilly kane murder- the trial and the characters dealing with lost family, and significant others.  the season starts off with a bus crash that veronica is convinced was aimed at her.  this season deals with solving the bus crash along with other things such as -did aaron echolls really kill lilly?? and just when you thought it was over- Also there are the traditional episode mysteries, a new one each episode.This season is just as good as the first season and after the season finale of season 2 im counting down the days unti the season 3 premeir October 3rd Tuesday 9 pm...Tune in, you wont' be disappointed.	5.0	A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.	2006-08-25	2	2	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	APCLGH2EPBBYF	AlexisClaire	I'm a big fan of the tv show Veronica Mars. Great writing combined with the quick wit of this lovable, petite sleuth makes for great tv. It's not your typical drama or your typical comedy, it's just good tv.I'd recommend this to: People of like darker comedies, people who like female-centric shows, and for people who have time to watch every episode. I say the latter because there's overlapping, overarching unsolved crimes that are interwoven into the season. I gave this one less star than I did for the first season because I thought there was too much going on for the big mystery and I don't like how some characters had been written off.	4.0	Marshmallow	2014-02-25	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2T8PX9KAVWVQC	A. L. Gamble	The concept of a teenaged girl private eye may not grab you, but the dialog and characters will.  Reminiscent of the works of Joss Whedon (Buffy, Firefly), Veronica Mars is the brainchild of Rob Thomas (Cupid).  Most of the acting and the relationship development are far better than we typically expect on TV.  The pop culture references are added fun.  I watched the entire season in one weekend - and I'm not the target audience.  Finally, a show that does not insult its audience!

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	AHKBRRVIGR8RN	Amanda J. Keyes	Season 1 of Veronica Mars was by far the best season of television I've ever seen.  Season 2 was a little harder to follow, complex and spread out too much with all the hiatuses.  But when you watch it in succession and get the benefit of continuity, you see that the complex and rather confusing season was still great!VM is smart, witty, sarcastic, and darkly funny all within a high school setting, though they just graduated, and high school drama is not a major part of the show.  I'm 23, so a little closer to high school than some, but I know plenty of grown women who understand the greatness of Veronica Mars!  It's the writing, the dialogue itself as well as the incredible delivery by these amazing actors, that really draws you in.  It's so intelligent and expects the audience to be as well.  Solving the mysteries is a huge draw to me, and the character development and chemistry really invests you in the show.  Without giving anything away, the end of season two was, of course, amazing.  It stepped it up for the last few episodes, just like the end of season one.  And when you don't lose the continuity in between all the episodes, you'll see it's still the best show out there.  Season one still rules the entire known universe, so buy that first, and then get your hands on season 2 quick, before season 3 starts because it's going to be an amazing season, I'm sure of it!	5.0	Veronica Mars is smarter than...pretty much everything!	2006-06-25	14	14	0

The 2013 Kickstarter inspired me to finally check it out. The episodes were available to stream online, but the bandwidth was just terrible. It staggered and stuttered, but I made it through the first episode. I decided to look into boxed sets here at Amazon, and I'm glad I did.Kristen Bell leads up a great ensemble drama. I know I'm not telling ""the marshmallows"" anything they don't already know. If you liked Buffy, this is the same sort of young adult vibe, minus the vampires. Veronica lives in a town that has some pretty distinct class lines. Somehow she manages to revolve in both orbits. She tries to hold down a typical teen job at the local coffeeshop, but really thrives while moonlighting for her dad, a private investigator.I really don't want to spoil this season, because people are likely to rediscover the show thanks to the Kickstarter. Lots of fun, unexpected turns headed your way in season 2.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	AN13D1I1QVTL1	Amazon Customer	I really can't begin to say how much I love this show.  This season is great, it has some really gut-wrenching scenes.  Once again there is one central big mystery, a bus crash that kills many students, and many smaller mysteries (many of which are connected to the larger mystery).  My only criticism is connected to the whole Duncan/baby drama.  I never liked his character much.  He definitely was better than in season one, though, and there were a few moments where I actually liked him.  The baby situation seemed odd, and just like a way to get rid of the character.  But when all is said and done, I never expected who was really behind the bus crash and was wanting MORE Veronica Mars!	5.0	Another great season!	2014-01-31	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3LNKAGMB0DTD8	Amazon Customer	It's a 1 hour show without the commercials (love that) and it's always interesting.  There are at least 2 or 3 subplots on each show and I love the witty  and sharp dialogue.  There are surprises during quite a few of the shows and the writing keeps you going and involved.  Lots of episodes and is really good if you're on the mend or the weather is so crummy you have to stay inside.You won't like this show if you don't like youth oriented shows, some sexual innuendo involving high school / college level and there are some stereo types.  I never watched the show in it's prime time back in 2004-2007 but I am so glad I have Amazon prime.  I get to try many shows that I never heard of.  Some I turn off and don't continue watching.  I've lost nothing because it's free with prime.  Others, like this show are gems for me.  By the way, if you stay with this show you will recognize many people that have gone on to star in other shows and movies.	5.0	A lot of fun	2014-01-28	0	0	0

""Veronica Mars"" is kind of like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" in that way. However, when some people happen to watch with you because they have nothing better to do, it's a good idea to have the DVDs handy because they will definitely want to borrow them.There are a standard set of extras for a TV show on DVD: deleted scenes, a couple of featurettes, and the aforementioned gag reel, but they are noticeably lacking commentary, the one thing I would have expected from Rob Thomas and crew."	5.0	Worth it for the gag reel alone	2007-01-26	1	1	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3HCN8KBB9PD8O	Andrea	"With most television shows, the sophomore season is kind of key. That's when you can tell if the series has long-term potential to be one of the great classic shows, or if the first season will always be remembered as the only ""true"" season of what once was a good show. With this second season, ""Veronica Mars"" proves to be the former. While most of the sophomore efforts of the big hit shows that I've seen have been disappointing this season (the worst offenders being the ones on ABC, imo), ""Veronica Mars"" and NBC's ""The Office"" remain as two of the only exceptions. For those new to the show (and I hope there will be plenty of those, b/c the show still doesn't get the viewers it deserves), here's a quick, as-spoiler-free-as-possible, season 2 synopsis:With her best friend's true murderer finally behind bars thanks to her, 18-year-old detective Veronica tries to start her senior year by getting her life back to normal after the cataclysmic events of last year. As we learn in the phenomenal season premiere, ""Normal is the Watchword,"" she'll find that very difficult since the noir-ish town in which she lives, Neptune, CA, is practically crumbling around her. Tensions between the haves and the have-nots have escalated exponentially ever since a mysterious tragedy that occured over the summer. In season 2, the class warfare becomes literal with someone very close to Veronica at the center. Oh, and at the end of the first episode, 8 people will be killed in a not-so-accidental accident that may have been meant for our heroine. This season introduces many more of the shady faces of Neptune, including femme fatale Kendall Casablancas (gleefully protrayed by Buffy/Angel-alum Charisma Carpenter), the new friendy, yet kind of creepy mayoral candidate Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg), and Neptune's ""first family of crime,"" the Fighting Fitzpatricks. As she gets reluctantly sucked into the season's two big murder mysteries, Veronica will also encounter everything from psychotic babysitting clients to a serial rapist at the college she will probably attend in season 3 to a dead guy who washes up on shore with her name written across his hand, and she will learn throughout the season that ""normal"" just isn't her.The great thing about ""Veronica Mars"" that sets it apart from other high-concept mystery shows (yes, I'm referring to ""Lost"") is that you have complete confidence in the writers (which was justified in season 1) to actually answer it all and tie all of these threads up into a neat little bow at the end of the season and still leave you dying for more. Next season, this and ""The Office"" will probably be the only non-HBO shows I'll be watching (unless the miracle that is ""Arrested Development"" somehow returns). This amazing 2nd season is not only more briskly-paced than season 1, but it's also more, as Logan would say, ""epic"" in scale and complexity, so this season, even more than season 1, will benefit from the DVD format so viewers can watch the episodes back-to-back to keep up with everything. As a major bonus, this set actually has *gasp* EXTRAS! It will have a behind-the-scenes featurette, a gag reel (Rob Thomas has mentioned that it will be from both seasons. Huzzah!), deleted scenes, and maybe more. That said, if you haven't seen Season 1, what are you waiting for?! That's available now! The brilliant writing and acting alone (Kristen Bell and Jason Dohring both turn in Emmy-worthy performances) make this well worth the price of a DVD set, not to mention the gorgeous and quirky cinematography/art direction and great music. Pick up both seasons. You won't regret it."	5.0	The best show on TV, with a second season even better than the first	2006-05-06	50	47	3

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	"Veronica Mars has some of the best writing on television today.  The show is full of multi-dimensional characters who all contribute to the world of Neptune, California, while the show's mysteries are well thought out and executed.  So it's a wonder as to why so few people watch the show.Minor spoilers belowThree months after almost losing her life to the killer of her best friend, Veronica Mars' (Kristen Bell) life has settled down for the most part.  She has left the private investigation business to become a waitress at a coffee bar called Java the Hut (did I mention that the show loves to play around with names?), and is once again dating Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn).  She left Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) after he was put through numerous trials and tribulations throughout the summer dealing with the death of a biker gang member.  Logan's inability to avoid trouble eventually drove Veronica away.  As the school year is ready to start, she is comfortable with her life.  Then she is pulled right back into the P.I. world when her best friend Wallace Fennel (Percy Dags III) fails his mandatory athletic drug test.  In addition, a few other non-09er (Neptune is a very rich town, and the rich kids are known as 09ers because their zip code is 90909) kids fail, as does Meg Manning (Alonna Tal), an 09er and ex-friend of Veronica.  The twist is that Meg was a friend to Veronica during their junior year; perhaps Veronica's only 09er friend.  However, Duncan and Meg dated in the previous season, and Meg blames Veronica for her break-up.  Needless to say Veronica finds the truth about the drug tests, but her victory is short-lived when a terrible bus crash takes the lives of 6 students (including Meg), a teacher, and the driver.Although the crash is originally thought to be the fault of a suicidal driver, evidence soon comes to light that indicates that someone sabotaged the bus.  Meanwhile, Weevil (Francis Capra), the leader of the biker gang with the member that died, is trying to get to the bottom of his friend's death.  While Logan seems to be the prime suspect, the pair both need to find the truth in order to save themselves.  Also, something from Wallace's past comes to Neptune after his mother accompanies Keith Mars (Enrico Collantoni) to Chicago.  Dick (Ryan Hansen) and Cassidy ""Beaver"" Casablancas (Kyle Gallner) also get expanded roles this year when their rich father marries a gold-digging step-mom, played by the wonderful (and hot) Charisma Carpentar.The side mysteries are all entertaining, but the bus crash is the most interesting and entertaining, and there are numerous new characters brought in to expand the mystery.  Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) is the owner of the Neptune baseball team who is now running for mayor.  He hosted a field trip at the stadium, and the bus was returning from the stadium when it went over the cliffs.  Terrence Cook (Jeffrey Sams) is a former ballplayer who was present at the stadium.  His daughter Jackie (Tessa Thompson) provides for an interesting character study.  She begins the season as a typical 09er who is spoiled and bratty.  After getting some help from Wallace, they begin a relationship that drives Veronica nuts.  But when her father is implicated in the crash, the students of Neptune turn on her, much like what happened with Veronica prior to the beginning of the series.  It's interesting to actually see the character's fall from grace that was only described when Veronica told her story in the series' pilot.All of the actors deserve a lot of credit for their characters.  Bell and Dohring especially are able to breathe such convincing life into their characters.  Veronica and Logan are two of the most complex characters I've ever seen.  Veronica is still sarcastic and pessimistic, but she is beginning to let people like her again.  Logan displays more emotions in single episodes than some characters do in the entire run of their series.  Sometimes he is a brazen jerk, other times he is sensitive and sad.  Wallace's role increases from the sidekick he was in season 1 to a full-fledged character this year.  Keith, Weevil, and Duncan are all as great as they were in the first season, and all of the newcomers do very well.  Of note are Jackie, whose character expertly adapts to the twists of the series, and Cassidy, whose emotions are almost as ranged as Logan's.Most of the recurring guest stars from the first season return and get even more screen time this time.  Mac (Tina Majorino) and Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) are given expanded roles, and Mac starts a relationship with Cassidy.  Madison Sinclair (Amanda Norret), Cliff McCormack (Darran Norris), and Vinnie VanLowe (Ken Marino) all get their share of comedic moments, and many new characters show up, played by actors like Kevin Smith, Joss Whedon (of Buffy, Angel, and Firefly/Serenity fame!), Michael Cera and Alia Shawkat (of the wonderful Arrested Development), and Lucy Lawless.If there is one thing to nit-pick, it would have to be the resolution of the bus crash mystery.  Fans are very divided on the issue; some loved it and thought that it seemed very natural, while others hated the finale, claiming that it moved too quickly and created some plot holes.  Personally, I still don't know where I stand on the issue.  I will say that I was upset because it retconned something from the first season that I thought worked much better the way it originally ended up.  Still, despite a polarizing ending, the season as a whole is amazing and is deserving of your attention.Sadly, despite the great acting and excellent writing, the ratings for Veronica Mars were still fairly low.  They got picked up for the new CW network at the last minute (and there was a great Arrested Development-style in joke reference in the last episode of the season).  It's amazing that shows so great (hey, mainstream critics love the show, so it must be doing something right) can struggle so much while mediocre and formulaic shows thrive.  If you love good television, you will love Veronica Mars, so please check it out if you haven't yet and keep Veronica and the rest of Neptune around for years to come."	5.0	Veronica Excels In Her Second Year, So the Real Mystery is Why Ratings Are So Low	2006-05-06	0	0	0

Seriously good television. You will laugh, cry, scream, be angry, feel every emotion imaginable, and become totally dedicated to these flawed, wonderful people. Far and away the best the television has to offer right now. I can hardly believe Rob Thomas et. al could top Season 1, but he did. Season 3 has a pretty tall order if it will be even close to this good, but the creative geniuses and cast behind Veronica Mars have definitely earned this viewer's trust.	5.0	Don't watch unless you're ready to be hooked	2006-05-20	20	19	1

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	AHNFPZPHD51GU	Aris Bock	The show is great.  What makes it stand out from other shows?  Fantastic lead actor with K Bell.  Great writing.  Great characters.  Particularly refreshing are the adult characters, especially her father.  In most &#34;teen&#34; dramas, the teens seem to exist in a peanuts-esque world where the adults are no where to be seen.  In VMars the adults are real characters, and her interaction with them has real consequences.  All the seasons of VMars are great, the first is the best (IMO) but the second are almost as good and well worth your time.  Start now and be finished in time to see the VMars movie being released on March 14th 2014.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1JU7DSQB1NMPH	Ashley Foy	a friend made me watch this show.. the whole time i tried to hate it. the premise seemed stupid (a teenage private investigator)to me, but it's a very clever, funny, well written show. it sucks you in emotionally and the mysteries are fun to follow. i'm a fan of arrested development, seinfield, gilmore girls, & six feet under to give you an idea of the different types of humor i would write home about. the pop culture references aren't quite as numerous as the gilmore girls, but i think that is a good thing.i agree that the second season is a bit hard to follow, but that's the perfect reason to get the dvd... watch them one after another if you can. in fact, you probably won't be able to stop watching.. it's a great show.	5.0	tv skeptic	2006-06-30	10	9	1

And yes, I already own it on DVD, but I've been watching it on Amazon while at the gym. It makes 45 minutes on the Arc trainer fly right by.The characters are well-developed. The writing is snappy and intelligent. The plots are full of fantastic twists. And the love story between Veronica and Logan...well, it's epic.This series is so amazing that fans donated over 5 million to Kickstarter to get a movie made. That speaks volumes. This is not some silly throw away show. Sure, it may be a &#34;teen&#34; drama, but it is not like any other &#34;teeny&#34; show out there. It's got a great sense of the old film noir private eye movies, with a sassy modern kick. Kristen Bell is spunky, edgy and yet loveable.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	AZKXH0J59TK11	"Ben Dugan ""Ben Dugan"""	"It is quite possible that ""Veronica Mars"" is the greatest show on television. It is the rare show that is infinitly watchable but rewards you if you watch it every week. It can be alternatingly funny and heartbreaking, clever and straight. The writting is consistantly the strongest on any television show currently on the air, and the show has a style all its own.For those who have yet to watch this second season when it was on the air on the UPN last year(I have actually met a few people who refused to watch it just so they could get this DVD and take it all in in one compacted week), let me just say that you are in for a treat. Multiple mysteries unravel each week, with at least three season long arcs and plethora of multiple episode arcs competing for attention. It is too the credit of the writers that the show never feels convuluted or complicated, probably because the writers always keep the focus of every story exactly where it should be, on the principal charactors. It also doesn't hurt that this season features the three best episodes of the show thus far: ""Donut Run"", the postively brilliant ""Plan B"" and the flawless, twisty finale ""Not Pictured"", where even a few lingering doubts are answered once and for all from season one. Where are the Emmy nods for this writting staff?Speaking of non-existant award nominations, ""Mars"" has, now that ""Arrested Development"" has gone the way of the buffalo, the best ensemble cast of any show currently on the air, anywhere. Not enough praise can be given to Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantino, who belong in a ""Thin Man"" movie thanks to their flawless delivery and timing, but the rest of the cast is equally good and underrated to the point of confusion. Francis Capra, who plays biker Weevil on the show, emits cool from his every pore, while Percy Daggs III, as Veronica's best friend Wallace, is the shows secret weapon, for lack of a better phrase. His cool, easy going charisma is the perfect counterpart to Bell's quickwitted charactor. The show wouldn't be half as good without the amazing Jason Dohring, as poor little rich boy Logan Echolls, an actor who never feels forced and seems to be having a great time playing the questionable Logan. Newcomer to the show Kyle Secor is also excellent in a key role. Only Teddy Dunn as Duncan fails to impress on the level of his co-stars, though playing a charactor who is on anti-depressants as a straight laced, slightly monotone cat may just be the greatest acting job ever. I have yet to make up my mind. And the litay of supporting charactors, most notably Harry Hamlin, who fans will recognize as Aaron Echolls from season one, Charisma Carpenter and the Gute himself, Steve Guttenberg(you read that right), are all excellent in important recurring roles.""Veronica Mars"" is a rare treat on television, a show that rewards you for paying attention and demands you have an attention span greater then that of a two year old. With two flawless seasons behind it, I can hardly wait until ""Mars"" is back this fall on the CW. Bring it on."	5.0	How can someone not love this show?	2006-08-31	7	7	0
B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A6TR61WV7ZD9Y	Benjamin Fritz	Veronica Mars was a great show... the first season. Second season was a huge disappointment. The mystery is extremely convoluted with a lot of plotlines that end up going nowhere. Season one was one of the best seasons of any television show ever because the character relationships were compelling and believable, the mini-mysteries each episode were fun, and the season-long mystery was brilliantly plotted out so we made progress each episode toward an extremely satisfying ending.In season two the dialogue is still sharp and the acting is good, so it's still kinda fun to watch. But the season-long mystery is a mess that gets so complicated you need a spreadsheed to keep up and the character relationships feel tired and phony. If you haven't watched this show, just get season one. If you've watched season one, be warned that you'll be disappointed by season 2.	2.0	Far inferior to season one	2006-07-25	76	18	58

It was so great of a show that I thought it was gonna be one of those shows that had a great start and then drops to mediocre............Not with this show!!  And now that I've seen all of season two, i can say just one thing, WOW!!!!!  Season two delivers in more ways than season one did!!!  I'll admit, it was much darker than season one but all the more better.  New characters, bigger character development and one hell of a twist (or twists).  If you haven't seen this show, i highly recommend you jump on the bandwagon!!  This normally isnt my kind of show (or so I thought), but when I bought the first for real cheap and out of curiosity, I had to own all three seasons......Speaking of which, it's a shame that television cancels all of the good shows and leaves the craaaaaaaap still on air.  If you have nothing but good things about this show, trust me, it lives up to its reputation and so much more.  even though it doesn't portray our world accurately, it brillaint defines youngsters having important and pivitol roles like older people and thats what i respect about about the show.  It definately made its place as my favorite show!!!!  And it gets better, SEASON THREE IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST TWO!!!!	5.0	Veronica Mars	2010-01-30	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	AKPW2IRLY7CMY	Bob Bennett	Season 2 continues where Season 1 left off, plus some good new mysteries.  Lots of humor, interesting characters, social commentary, varied romances, plus detective work.  If there is a fault, it's that little Veronica is too devious in her plotting for her age.  Or maybe I just have never known anyone who could come up with the schemes she creates.  As with Season 1, I would not recommend for the younger set because of sex and drugs.	4.0	More of an addictive series	2014-06-06	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A19GZ9YIKNUFCR	Bob Wilson	Veronica Mars is a remarkably good series.  Instead of centering around high school angst, the pivotal plot elements are murders and other mysteries that are adroitly solved by young Ms. Mars.  The cast are attractive and engaging and the writing and direction are great, and the dynamic tension between the rich and poor sides of town are well crafted.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3FLN6RY8J8LKV	Boston Apollo	Just plowed through Season 2 in the past 3 days...Awesome.While not as good as the first year in that, except for Meg on the bus, I didnt care about the victims. In the first season we got to know Lilly Kane through flashbacks and empathized with Veronicas  grief over losing someone she idolized...However being in the Veronica Mars world with its dimly lit sets and snappy dialogue more than makes up for this negative. The last episode blew my mind..just wish they had more episodes like that with the revelations and action.  Season 3 will be doing mini-stories so hopefully that will keep things more interesting.Loved seeing the scene between Alyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter. It brought out the inner buffy geek in me.All in all this show is better than most shows and my second favorite after LOST.	5.0	Great Sophomore Season for Veronica Mars	2006-08-27	3	3	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3JJRAKWPGI8PE	"Brent Beery ""Dad"""	This is a very entertaining series if you're really desperate for entertainment.  The problems with the series are many. The teens in the show are always drinking and or having sex.  You would think that this is how all teens act and behave.  It takes place around school and yet no one seems to ever do homework, but they always have time for a party. Even my teenagers laugh at how old some of the actors appear.  We got tired of the same endless loop.	2.0	not worth your time	2014-05-04	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A8TM0MI3D9T29	Brett Corkins	Everyone's favorite high school detective is back at it, and maybe getting deeper than she should.There were a lot of questions for Veronica Mars heading into the second season. Will it be able to match the genius of the first season? How can the new 'big mystery' even compare to the one we saw in the first season? Among others. However, there were a lot of questions left hanging once last season ended so if you took the time to watch it there's no way you're not going to watch the second season if you're seeking answers.What are the big mysteries this season? Here's only a sneak-peak:A bus crash.A murder.An unfolding drug ring.After a bit of a shaky first episode (there was A LOT of explaining to do which results in A LOT of flashbacks), everything else flows just as easily and perfectly as it did before. Veronica is still that sassy teen detective we all love. Wallace, thankfully, gets a much better and more detailed background. Keith continues his wonderful father role and digs his teeth into a couple juicy cases. Logan is still that 'love him or hate him' kind of guy, but we can start to understand why he is the way he is. Then there's Duncan. I'm still not big on him but he seems considerably less wooden this time around.Whether it's the mysteries that keep you coming back or it's the humor, just know that both those ingredients--and the seldom talked about intense emotional moments--are there in full force. Season two of Veronica Mars only solidifies why we love the show. Word of advice, prepare to be blown away by the season finale.Oh, and is it just me or is it completely hilarious how much Veronica wants a pony?	5.0	Dad, your hooker's here...	2007-09-12	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A31OQI7X63PZ93	Britney	I was surprised to learn this show only lasted 3 seasons.  I love Veronicas snarky attitude.  It is a cross between Alias and a teen drama.  It has the spy element (which I love) but without the unrealistic aspect of scaling building and unlimited finances.  You have teen drama (but Im 30 and enjoyed it).

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1SANWT4A9H59Y	"Caillan Dimmick ""Nalliac"""	I know that most people think that the second season of Veronica Mars is not as good as the first, but I found myself enjoying it more. If the over-arching storyline is not as compelling, the stand alone episodes definitely are. But even saying this, if you had to make me choose which season long arc was better, I wouldn't be able to choose. Season 2 definitely delivered on the lofty heights that Veronica Mars season 1 set.During season 2 there are some fantastic episodes, probably my personal favourite being the final episode 'Not Pictured', which feels like the very thing the entire first 2 seasons were building towards. This is truly compelling television.As far as the DVD set goes, this delivers about what you'd expect. While it doesnt go all out on the extras, what is there is quality. I would have liked to have seen some commentaries but I'm a commentary fan, and some do not share this sentiment. The extras features include deleted scenes, bloopers, a video diary on the set for a day with Kristen Bell and a documentary. All well worth it. Also, for those who care, the box art is superior to season 1 in my opinion.Note: Buffy fans. If you want to see your lord and master, Joss Whedon ranting about minstrils, check out the bloopers. It's hilarious.Overall a fantastic season of a great show and a great DVD package for it. Highly reccommended.	5.0	Better than season 1	2007-10-11	0	0	0

They resolve some mysteries, leave some with implied closure and some continue open-ended.  Season 2 fits well with season 1.  I think the ending is a little out of character for the show, though.  The bad guy is a stretch and there was a more intense danger/rescue sequence that felt like other crime shows and not Veronica Mars...not sure how to explain.  Still, I like it and keep watching.  On to season 3 with more sass, smarts and colorful characters.	5.0	Happy with this	2014-03-31	0	0	0

Great dialogue: ""Annoy little blond one, annoy like the wind"" still being my favorite.  And though it's a little older in themes, Veronica Mars never forgets that, yes, this is a high school show.I also have to admit, I never watched the show on TV, I didn't get it until well after it had aired and I had the Third Season on TV.  And being, that I LOVED the Third Season, the First and Second far surpassed my expectations.If you're looking for a good detective show, or an even better teen show, I strongly advise this whole series."	5.0	I loved this Series.	2008-04-05	1	1	0

If you liked season 1 you should like season 2.  Season 3 takes a dip and of course ends with no conclusion because the season wasn't written to be the last so you have to accept just having the story line end without any sort of conclusion.	4.0	About like season 1	2014-03-27	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2QHYTS231GJB3	Christie W.	"Though I didn't enjoy the second season quite as much as the first, it is still great entertainment.  This season the mystery surrounds a school bus crash.  There are many suspects and red herrings but the ultimate perpetrator is a BIG surprise.  The chemistry between Veronica and Wallace is still great fun to watch- they really come off as great friends, and show a lot of spark and mischief in just a twinkle of the eye.  The same is true with Veronica and her father.  They have a very unique father-daughter relationship.  I'm kinda jealous... They have great rapport- their conversations are always fun, playfully combative and witty banter, the dad is funny/silly/goofball but ultimately cares for and protects Veronica.The season is a fun medley of mystery, intrigue, romance, friendship, and ""normal"" high school drama.  Veronica graduates from high school and you're left to wonder just what is to come of the feisty detective next... The season finale isn't quite as stressful and suspenseful as the first but it's still a heart-pounding roller coaster ride of emotions.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"You know, I got a confession to make: I hate these kind of shows. Not that they're bad, of course not. Well-written enthralling dramas with likable characters and it's that reason why I hate it: you get so wrapped up in it that I was watching it on DVD going ""...okay, just ONE more episode"" and sure enough I figure I'm only 2 discs away from finishing the season so why not just finish it off. Be warned: if shows like 24, Alias or Lost got you hooked, well this show is certainly gonna get you hooked deep.I haven't watched Season 1 yet(stupid stores don't even carry it for rent, let alone sale anymore) but essentially it's like this: the killer of Lilly Kane has been found but that's not all. Apparently, Logan is the prime suspect in the murder of a latino gang member, a PCHer and it only gets worse. Missing a bus ride back home from a field trip, she actually discovers the bus careened off the road, killing eventually everyone on board. Suicidal driver? Lost control? Or did someone cause it to crash?One thing I remember hearing about the first season was that the main storyline arc, the murder of Veronica's best friend Lilly Kane, gave the show an emotional resonance, a kind of drive. A bus accident, while it's more ambitious, has a detached feeling at times, almost like it's just a big long mystery to solve rather than a need to. However, the season is packed with other mysteries and little cases Veronica takes that helps the show along. One complaint was that when the suspect is outed and brought out into the open, you kinda felt like...""uh, him/her/them?""(I'm not spoiling who it is of course so might as well use all of those). While it's not a horrible whodunnit, and it does make sense, you almost feel like all that work was done by....um, the suspect(s). It's hard not to spoil this thing when you're writing it.What ultimately keeps the show together, apart from its characters, are the actors and luckily we have Kristen Bell as the titular sleuth. Sassy, funny, and showing a surprising pathos, she injects the character with a lovable quirkiness that even falls apart and breaks down. Yes, we all love our Jack Bauer bad***es but now and then, we fall for those characters with humanity. Then of course there's Enrico Colantini who is arguably the coolest dad who's likable and non...""dad""-like while still being tough and protection without being that strict militant dad. And what would a top rated show be without guest stars and we got lots, from Kevin Smith to Joss Whedon to Alyson Hannigan to Charisma Carpenter providing a season long role(and getting the Buffy fans riled up) with the last 3.Is there any complaints? Well one, the severe disappointment in the extras. Granted it is a season set show so you're not expecting something full-blown like a Lord of the Rings EE release but you get absolutely no commentaries, 2 sketchy featurettes and an admittedly funny gag reel and deleted scenes. Obviously wanting to be rushed before the third season starts, you get the feeling they just said hell with any substantial extras and just went for it. My Samurai Jack discs had more extras than this.If you're into these kind of shows you are going to get hooked easily. The problem though is that replayability isn't as kind. Shows like Smallville, Simpsons or X-Files were great because you could watch them out of order and still be enthralled while Alias, 24 and this show deserve to be seen from start to finish. So keep in mind while it will enthrall the first time, it's hard to watch them again without that captivation that had you the first time."	5.0	Unbelievably compelling TV	2006-08-29	2	2	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2REQQJBJW302M	C. Thomas	"A friend introduced me to ""Veronica Mars"" by showing me a few episodes of the first season, and while I normally _really_ don't like high school movies and TV series, I found myself liking this one in spite of myself.  After rushing through the first season, I picked up season 2 in the hopes that what I liked about the show was still around, and that Rob Thomas would improve on the few rough edges I'd seen in the introductory season.The mystery for the second season feels much better constructed than the previous big whodunit, and seemed a lot more solid, well-written, and feasible, while still challenging the viewer to keep up.  The writers let Veronica grow up a bit more and face more of the consequences for her choices in the various relationships she has with other characters, and that's a good thing.  A few more of the supporting roles got more screen-time and development, which was a definite plus in my book.On the downside, some of the important supporting characters were written out mid-season in some obvious ""I'm pursuing other career options"" manners, and some of the subplots just don't get the resolution they deserve - at times, it feels like the show's creative staff bit off more than they could chew.  There are a few moments when it really does seem like there's more going on than they can honestly and fairly present in the course of the season.Nonetheless, I was very glad to have added this set to my bookshelf, and I'm looking forward to picking up season three!"	4.0	Good (if chaotic) follow-up to the first season.	2008-01-13	0	0	0
B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3T6JY3U2B8YF7	"C.

First ex-boyfriend Logan is accused of murdering Felix, a PCH motorcycle gang member and then a bus load of high school kids is sent hurtling over a cliff by an exploding bomb.While who caused the bus crash and who really killed Felix are the season long mysteries, Veronica also finds herself embroiled in smaller cases brought to her by the students of Neptune High.This season found the series experiencing some growing pains as the tangled plot lines mounted up and the characters were shaded with a darker brush, but the writers were once again able to tie up all clues into a cohesive and shockingly satisfying finale.If you enjoy well written stories, strong character developement, clever dialogue, brilliant acting by pretty people and answers instead of more questions by the seasons end, this may be the show for you.Oh. And the CW just announced Veronica Mars will be on their schedule for a season three. So watch season two before Veronica and crew head out to college in the fall!"	5.0	This face?

There are plenty of characters [some suddenly re-appearing from season 1].This of course means that it's much more fun to watch the series on DVD - all the episodes one after the other (oh, and try to keep away from spoilers!).It's something like the difference between riding a really gigantic roller-coaster in one go - or spreading it over 22 weeks.The bad news - no commentaries, very few extras.	5.0	Excellent show, a multitude of plot twist and turns	2006-08-31	1	1	0

Veronica and her father, Keith Mars, are so perfectly cast that they alone raise the whole thing to a higher level; when you add in the clever plotting and sharp, very witty dialogue, it's top notch. I would also point out the lack of bloody corpses such are constantly found in most detective and police series. Yes, each season has a death, or deaths, with a long story arc through the entire season; but the individual mysteries in each episode rarely involve murder.	5.0	A really excellent series.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1HX00DL0SZM1G	"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer"""	"Thank you Warner Home Video, for releasing the second season of my favorite television series in August instead of waiting until October as you did for Season 1.For those looking for the true heir to Buffy the Vampire Slayer in terms of a sharp script and snappy dialogue look no further than the UPN show Veronica Mars. Not since Sunnydale dropped into a deep chasm has television seen such a fabulous ensemble of talented young actors deliver such inventive dialogue in intelligent, darkly humorously directed fare.For me Tuesday nights became the most anticipated TV night of the week and I could not get enough of the show or its hot star Kristen Bell. It quickly shot up the rankings on my TiVo season pass where it now sits at number one and my Kristen Bell TiVo wish-list was set to auto-record so I would not miss any program in which she was featured. I remember the anger when my local UPN station decided to air a baseball game instead of one episode - never have I felt more like putting pen to paper to express my displeasure with a programming decision.So what is this show that induces such passion? It's a detective show, no it's a romantic drama, or is it a dark comedy? Well, in reality it is all of this and more. Set in the California city of Neptune, it paints the picture of a society split between the have's such as the rich Kane family or movie star Aaron Echoll's children and the have-nots (notably title character Veronica Mars and her friends Wallace and Weevil).Veronica is the daughter of Keith Mars, the former Sheriff, who is now a private detective. The first season centered around the investigation into the murder of Veronica's best friend Lilly and  Veronica's rape and the second  season centers on the investigation into a bus crash that sent a group of students over a cliff to their deaths - a bus that Veronica was supposed to be riding. In addition a second mystery that is not resolved until later in the season is who was responsible for the death of Weevil's cousin Felix.But, as Veronica continues her investigation each episode involves the investigation into a lesser mystery. From who was responsible for the death of a classmates dog to the blackmail of gay studentsVeronica (with the help of Wallace, Mac and assorted other friends) must navigate a world of pirate radio stations, Irish gangs and still vie for the Kane scholarship, which would allow her to make her dreams of attending Stanford a reality.In addition to the great script the other strength of the show is in assembling a wonderful ensemble of young actors. Led by Kristen Bell who as Veronica outdo's Buffy in the dry humor department, and ably supported by Canadian actor Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars, the two really display a true father-daughter affection for each other which apparently was true off-screen as well. In addition to this dynamic there is also Percy Daggs III as Veronica's best friend (and cohort in her investigations) Wallace and Jason Dohring appears as Logan, the bad-boy rich kid son of Aaron (played by Harry Hamlin of ""Clash of the Titans"" fame).Completing the talented young cast is Francis Capra as biker bad-boy Weevil and new to this season is the very appealing and spunky Tessa Thompson as Wallace's girlfriend Jackie. She was disliked initially by fans though as the season went on she became more popular - personally I had liked her from her first scene.This show needs to be seen to be believed. Sure I am a diehard fan of the show, but I defy any viewer not to became charmed by the drama, romance, humor and well drawn characters. Yes, the mysteries are solved but a lot of the fun comes in the journey towards those last episodes of the season. The season finale aired just last night and I was blown away by it. I was shocked and drawn in to every emotionally powered minute of it and fans across the internet are raving about it. Season 3 simply cannot come soon enough for me.On this DVD set of six discs we are promised a behind the scenes featurette, gag reel and deleted scenes which would be a vast improvement on the relatively bare-bones season 1 release. Warner Bros. was apparently surprised by the fan following that VERONICA MARS had developed during season 1 so they did not prepare adequately for that season's DVD release. Thankfully they were better prepared this time around."	5.0	Season 2 of the best show on television comes to DVD	2006-05-10	132	119	13

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2VJ8UH17L4SEN	David	Over the years I had taken some time off from watching television. In fact I didn't have a TV in my home for almost 10 years and then I had one only for movies in my bedroom. It was never the centerpiece to my living areas. The TV is still not a big thing in my home, but I DO watch the shows now and there are an interesting mix of what's been out there. Take Veronica MARS for instance. This particular season is quite old by modern standards yet to me it is fresh, and witty. I see some actors that are in other shows as well, proving out that they are in demand. The only thing I find a little off about this show is that Veronica does not seem like the teen she is supposed to be most of the time! This certainly keeps me interested as she knows how to use what she has. THe plots that Veronica and her dad/friends get into are the reason I gave the rating. Even for an older show... it still seems fun to me!	4.0	Catching up on Television	2014-03-30	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3HT7THRDLPUHH	"D. Brunner ""tv on dvd fan"""	After the sensational first season of Veronica Mars, one would have high hopes for season 2. Comparing the seasons leads me to rate this one a little lower, but believe me when I say this is still one of the best shows on television.Season 1 used a brilliant format. Mystery starts, plot twists along the way, cliffhangers galore, mystery solved, and another cliffhanger leaving us eagerly anticipating season 2. Possibly trying to shake things up a bit, you learn from the first few episodes of season 2 that its gonna be a busy season. The cliffhanger from last season gets wrapped a little too quickly for my liking, and opens up a whole box of new mysterys. It all leaves you slightly confused.More storylines wouldn't be a bad thing, but I found myself through the whole season expecting one to continue to build as they worked on the others, but most of the time you get a several episode delay before the other story is worked off of again. It leaves you almost forgetting what the other major plot twist was. They all wrap up by seasons end, but I was very underwhelmed when compared to last years fantastic finale.Kristen Bell continues to shine as she adds layer and layer of substance to this great character. Even if the storylines disappoint (which they do not, just a little cluttered) she could carry this show to be good anyway. The rest of the cast does an excellent job but Bell is the star of this show, and would be even if she wasn't the main character.Was this a good season? Yes. Was it as good as season 1? No. That won't stop you from enjoying this show. Within the first minute of season 2 I was smiling just seeing Bell work her wit, and I think I kept in on until the last episode. As I said there's a lot going on with this one. The characters are going through transitions, and they leave you with yet another top notch cliffhanger. Can't wait for season 3.	4.0	Bell steals the show again - 3 1/2 stars	2007-02-08	4	3	1

The characters are great the episode plots are engaging and the background plot keeps you wondering until the end of the season.  Each episode stands on its own, but the background plot just adds that much more.  Kristen Bell is smart, perky and makes you wish you were back in high school. Can't wait to start season 3 and see what mysteries and adventure await.  This is a must see for those that like smart plots, pretty blonds, and to be entertained for an hour an episode making you want more!!!	5.0	Not What I Expected	2014-02-13	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1M2L89Q3S540W	"Diane L. Thompson ""magicmom"""	Season two of Veronica Mars saw Ms. Mars gain even more acceptance and notoriety at her school. Being a teenage private eye can do that for you, I guess. Ms. Mars is working with and dating the 1 per centers in our fictional seaside village of Neptune, CA and sleuthing on the side. She and her 47% buddies solve crime while dealing with teen angst. The 1 per centers, meanwhile, live their shallow lives of privilege and tragedy. The overarching theme is 'who caused the bus crash at the end of season one.' The trail leads in many directions revealing secrets of both the rich and the less fortunate. The true villain is a complete and heart-wrenching surprise. But, as with the entire series, the fun is watching the luminous Kristen Bell wise-crack her way through the show.	5.0	Love All Mars Seasons	2014-06-06	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3RTMB76CJWY9U	DonAthos	"Veronica Mars' sophomore effort (or, according to the series, her senior one) is excellent, if it doesn't quite achieve the heights of the first season.It has a lot to live up to, after all, and the resolution of the bus accident just doesn't have the same punch as finding out who killed Lilly Kane. Also, we've moved past the unexplored romantic tensions between Veronica and Logan that provided so much kick to the mid-to-late parts of the first season, and are stuck instead in a bizarre love pentagon with Veronica, Logan, Meg, Duncan and Kendall.Some characters, so central to the series initially, leave for a while and sometimes come back (and sometimes, not). While the final few episodes find a spark, again, and provide worthy thrills and chills, it isn't as fulfilling or meaningful as the season that came before it.Not that this is a crime. The Second Season of Veronica Mars is still well-written, and beautifully acted by most of its regulars. The emergence of ""Beaver"" as a main character and his fledgling romance with always-endearing Mac is one of the highlights, as is the continued stunt-casting brilliance, finding roles (among others) for Kevin Smith and Joss Whedon.On the whole, Veronica Mars is one of the recent bright spots in all of television, and these episodes are no exception to that. A four-and-a-half star season from a five star show: rounds up to five."	5.0	Slightly Down From a Brilliant First Season; Still Wonderful Nonetheless	2008-03-31	1	1	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A24GCTNN0SZCHA	D. Thompson	I really enjoy Veronica Mars and her ablility to defy odds, solving cases and jailing bad guys but the second season of the show didn't feel as personal to the character. Almost daunting, it appears as if something is missing and there is no motivation. I however found comfort in the cast that makes this better Veronica's a little more bareable such as Wallace, Mac and Weevil. The conclusion to this season is undoubtly better to me than the first but the road there seemed misguided almost as if Rob Thomas knew the bunny trail ended but he didn't have the pebbles to follow to get there.The DVD set also offered alot more of the deleted and extended scenes that the first season set but much like the first season did not offer more commentary on the show from actors, producers or even a stage hand.	3.0	Not as Great the Second Time Around	2007-01-11	3	1	2

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3H35I4R0AUFAI	E. Baas	After watching season 1 of VM, I was totally hooked. I watched it 3 times and couldn't wait for season 2. Since I'm from the Netherlands, I couldn't watch it on tv, so I had to wait till it was released on dvd. I already read a lot of reviews and, judging from these reviews, thought it would be as good as season 1. However, I didn't agree to that fact. Don't get me wrong, VM is still in my top 5 shows ever, but I think season 1 was better, so season 2 only deserves 4 stars. The main problem was the bus crash story. The outline is just very confusing and not nearly as interesting as the Lilly Kane murder. I also didn't like Veronica and Duncan together, I was so happy to see her back together with Logan the last episode!! Besides these 2 points, I even thought the episode mysteries were less exciting than the ones in season 1. This all must sound very negative, but I just thought season 1 was better, and was somewhat disappointed in the second season. However, I'm still a loyal fan and can't wait for season 3!	4.0	Still very good, but not as good as season 1	2006-09-27	1	1	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A372GY8EZ4NFRJ	E. Dixon	I consider the first season of Veronica Mars to be nearly perfect, and the second season does very little to disappoint. It is another season-long mystery slowly solved over the 20 something episodes, with smaller mysteries and reveals strewn throughout the season. This recipe worked great for the first season, and works just as good here. While the ending seemed just a tad overdramatic (not much more than the first, though, come to think of it), there is very little to dislike about it. If you enjoyed the first season in any way, you can't go wrong with watching the second as well.	4.0	Almost rivals the first.	2009-07-02	0	0	0

If you like The OC, Gossip Girl, One Tree Hill, Saved By the Bell or anything in that vein you will LOVE VERONICA MARS better. Trust me. The show is early 2000's dated for sure and the budget is low but these facts make the show even more lovable in many ways. I didn't love the main mystery involving the bus.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A33Z8L75OXCP78	Eric Schenk	"Are the plots great.  Not really. They're okay, sometimes clever, but not great.  So how do you explain the large number of not just positive, but adoring, reviews for this show?  Perhaps it is because ""Veronica Mars"" offered memorable, flawed, yet heroic characters, played by engaging actors, speaking exquisite dialog that resonated with first-class wit, and sincere emotion.  All of those qualities are, sadly, in short supply.I am a 56 year old attorney.  I watch football, basketball and movies on television.  But the only episodic television shows I watch are:  HBO's The WireThe Wire - The Complete First SeasonThe Wire - The Complete Second SeasonThe Wire - The Complete Third SeasonThe Wire - The Complete Fourth Season, 30 Rock30 Rock - Season 1and Flight of the Conchords.Flight of the Conchords - The Complete First SeasonI love all of those shows. In particular, I'm a member of the crowd that believes ""The Wire"" is a work of art. But the only show I obsessed over is/was Veronica Mars. Seriously. I pine over its cancellation almost as if my first love had just broken up with me. To steal one of the show's most captivating phrases, it reminded me of when waves of romance first washed over me and I thought that life and love would be ""Epic --  spanning years and continents, ruined lives, blood shed; Epic.""Before I go on, however, let me stress the fact that the show features a great wit. You can get a taste of the show's wit by reading the article Wikipedia published at: [...](and then consider what sort of show on the WB would justify such a page?)It is the sort of ""silly television dramedy"" that has prompted serious academics to put down their Nietzsche and Shakespeare and write charming, thoughtful essays about their obsession with this show.  Many of these essays are collected in ""Neptune Noir""Neptune Noir: Unauthorized Investigations into Veronica Mars (Smart Pop series).Find out why this ratings-challenged show that the WB network treated like a poor relation, has evoked this sort of response.Risk the obsession.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1XRA4GAWUI277	"E. R. Morris ""Erica R. M."""	"It seems like all the shows I fall in love with are ones I think look stupid from the previews.  I figured ""oh  a kid who works for her Daddy and helps him solve crimes... that's for teenagers.""  WRONG.This show is more adult than Desperate Housewives.  Kirsten Bell (Veronica) is light years beyond her age.If you like political correctness, this show is not for you.  If you don't like dry sarcastic humor, this show is not for you.But I do like non- PC shows and I do like dry humor, it also mirrors real situations and the cinemaphotography is AMAZING!  Once again, not a teeny bopper show.The first season starts off with Veronica as a regular teenager who cared about boyfriends and proms and didn't really care to do anything with Private Investigation (her father- a disgraced Sheriff's job)  This show explores the social devide in California, between mostly the poor Mexicans and the rich White kids.  As Veronica's father was once Sheriff, that pulled a lot of water in this tiny town, and she was one of the popular rich kids.  Then once her rich, White best friend was murdered (the sister of her boyfriend) And her father suspected the most powerful man in town (her friend and boyfriend's father) of murdering the girl, the kids at school gave her the choice to stick with her father and be ousted from their clique or disagree with her father and stay ""one of them""  she chose her dad.  Therefore, Veronica is the girl in the middle, trying desperatly to find out who killed her best friend, and many other things that have happened to her that stole her high school girl innocence.  She has some friends on the rich/white side and some on the poor/mexican side.The very best thing about Veronica Mars is that each episode contains more information, clues, excitment, adventure, romance, betrayl and more than most shows fit into a whole season-- NOT a show you can watch while you're multi-tasking!  I record the shows on VCR until the dvd comes out.Honestly I would say that if you are 18 or 78 you will love this show and especially Veronica and her father.

It is now the reason for several generations to come together and religiously, see and enjoy each and every episode. Kristen Bell has matured and her performance is superb. The learning that takes place thanks to these shows, is simply something no one who has teenagers at home should by-pass. For example, the sequence offered while Veronica Mars attends Jury Duty provided the insight necessary to teach Katya, Nadya, Monica and Michele about civic duty and the awesome responsibility we have as citizens of the United States. Would highly recommend owning both seasons if you want to foster an open environment. Thanks to Veronica Mars our communications lines are... best in class!The first season of Veronica Mars simply delighted the family. It captured the attention of several generations that now gather, religiously, to see and enjoy each and every episode. Thanks to this show, we traveled to Texas with our cousins, Monica and Michele Del Rosario, to meet the star of the show, Kristen Bell. We were fortunate enough to also meet several cast members, also attending this event. One of the highlights of the trip was encountering Kristen Bell during an elevator ride, for we were staying at the same hotel. Of course, we have the photo to prove our amazing luck! Veronica Mars has brought adventure to our lives, but better yet, it has opened the channels of communications between family members, Monica, Michele, Katya, Nadya, Alex and I, who now have in common an appreciation for this sleuth of a show!

It is fun and interesting and even though I have seen this before, it is still great light mystery type entertainment.  We are currently on a wait list at the library for the movie.  Apparently there are a lot of people that love this series because our library bought 20 copies.I never watched this when it was on TV, but it is a great way to avoid basketball, hockey and baseball if you aren't a fan of sports.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A99B6ZW89PEPI	F. Weiner	Loved the first season and was not disappointed by Season 2.  In fact, this season's main story arc (who sabotaged a school bus and sent it over a cliff killing several students) was probably even better than the first.  The cast of Veronica Mars is first rate - all the principals are outstanding and the creators consistently used star talent even in the smaller guest roles. Despite the show's age (over ten years), the weekly episodes are as fresh and topical as ever.  With the Veronica Mars movie about to be released (March 2014), hurry up and watch so you can enjoy all the &#34;in&#34; jokes.	5.0	Still the same sassy Veronica	2014-02-08	1	0	1

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	Geminigirl	"This season starts off a few months after the shocking events from the season 1 finale, Veronica's life & the lives of those in her universe have changed some for better & some, worse.  Veronica is determined to get back her normal life but nothing is normal about life in Neptune.  The same great core cast & excellent writing remain the cornerstone of the show but it did take a darker turn and the ""mysteries"" became more convoluted.This season also introduced seemingly minor characters - the Casablancas family, Wallace's father & new girlfriend and Mac - Veronica's classmate & computer ""go to gal"".  The only development that saddened me was the abrupt end to the romance between Veronica's dad & Wallace's mom - surely a show with such creative writers could have featured a classy break-up segment to give viewers some closure.This season's arcs were Veronica solving the mystery of the bus accident that killed the driver and several classmates and who killed Weevil's cousin.  Although not as compelling as the first season, this one still packs a punch in unraveling the two main mysteries as well as tying up loose ends from the previous season (one shockingly so since viewers believed that this storyline had been resolved already).It was great to be able to watch the show uninterrupted in one sitting because it made it easier to follow the storylines since when the show initially aired, I'd lost interest after the CW changed the air day & time so getting a chance to see the story resolution first hand was great."	4.0	Veronica Mars - Season 2, 4.5 stars	2011-08-28	2	2	0
B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	ATZ1LTONGHOP6	Genevieve Hayes	"Darker than the first season and less satisfying in its resolution, the second season of ""Veronica Mars"" is, nevertheless, still likely to please fans of the series. The over-arching mystery of this season centres around a bus accident that results in the deaths of a number of Neptune High students, but other mysteries that Veronica must solve include the murder of one of Weavil's friends, possibly by Logan, and the molestation of a group of young men when they were boys. We also get to see the outcome of the events of Season one, including the trial of Aaron Echolls.Child abuse and molestation are the main themes in this season of ""Veronica Mars"", and the makers of the show deal with them reasonably well, although they didn't quite manage to make the ultimate consequences of the molestation/abuse believable to me. Whereas in Season One, it seemed believable that Aaron Echolls could be a murderer, I just didn't believe in the ultimate reveal of this season. It's not to say that the makers of the series didn't try. As in the first season, by the final episode it is clear that clues to the killer had been laid right from the beginning, and I appreciate that, but it just didn't quite work.Having said that, I still enjoyed Season Two of ""Veronica Mars"" very much. It is still one of the smartest teen shows ever made and I thoroughly enjoyed every episode. Hopefully other fans of the series will feel the same."	4.0	Darker and less satisfying than Season One.	2009-05-08	2	2	0

Rob Thomas must have learned something from Joss Whedon for the Joss man has proclaimed himself one of the show's greatest fans.The season starts out with a bang literally as we have a busload of students blasted off a cliff and Logan still reeling from accustions of murder from the season 1 cliffender on the bridge.The season brings out many twists in both mysteries and keeps the audience guessing as the show seamlessly weaves a ""mystery of the week"" with the season long arcs.  Some may think this latest season too dense, too complicated, but I love my shows to challenge me and keep me thinking.Patience is important and so is character-development.  VM does this so well.  The writing of characters, main and guest, is so sharp and the acting so well done.  Quirky quotable quotes abound in each episode with wit and irony.A must buy DDV if you love your heroines sassy and the love interests compelling (Logan and Veronica are mesmerizing every time they share the screen whether snarking or actually making nice.)"	5.0	Best Season of Best Show Ever	2006-07-26	18	15	3

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2HVL790PBWYTU	"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read"""	"****SPOILERS ALERT*****So, here's VERONICA MARS - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON, which ushers in our favorite teen sleuth's high school senior year. And some things have changed for the Mars family. It's been three months since the events of Season One's eventful final episode. Keith Mars, Veronica's dad, is still a private eye, but, now, he's written a New York Times bestseller (95th on the list) regarding the Lilly Kane Murder, and he's also running for Sheriff. He's hired by a prominent pro baseball player who fears he may be implicated in a serious crime. He also becomes buddies with the Neptune mayor, who, like all politicians, begin asking for favors. But never mind that. Suffice it to say, Keith Mars remains the coolest, most understanding dad ever on TV. Veronica, our wry and prickly 18-year-old heroine, seems to be a bit more content nowadays. She's survived and moved on from last year's ostracism, though she still navigates the vicious morass of teenage social politics, often finds herself embroiled in the class wars between the haves and the have-nots, and, of course, suffers thru that old reliable youthful malady: teen angst. But, now, she's got a normal gig waitressing at a restaurant and even finds time to have a romantic life every now and then. And, being Veronica Mars, she still solves cases. As usual, she is aided and abetted by her best friend Wallace (who goes thru his own set of rough times here) and Mac, the nerdy computer hack.And just because Lilly Kane's murder has been solved, and the murderer imprisoned, that doesn't mean that there isn't a season-long mystery to mull over. In fact, we are treated to two season-long mysteries, as well as further ramifications of the slaying of Lilly Kane. The first big mystery involves a school bus which careens over a cliff and kills everyone on board, most of whom were Neptune High students. Veronica is compelled to get to the bottom of this case; she had an ex-friend on that bus, and also suspects that she herself was the one targeted by the saboteur (she was supposed to be on that bus). The second mystery, which actually begins in Season One's final episode, revolves around who killed Felix, a cousin and crony member of Weevil Navarro's PCH bike gang. Throughout the season, we also witness Ms. Mars take on cases involving student athletes flunking their drug tests, pizza boy muggings, gay website blackmailing, tracking down the identity of an abused child, Wallace being framed for a hit and run, the theft of a school cash box, a missing bride-to-be, a disgruntled custodian, etc. My favorite mystery of the day may have been when Veronica goes to jury duty and enacts her own version of 12 ANGRY MEN. Add to all that the trial of Aaron Echols, which requires the testimonies of the Mars family, and you could see how full Veronica's plate is this season.The cast is great, as ever. The regulars' acting performances maintain the high standards set with last season's debut. This show has been compared to BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, DAWSON'S CREEK, and even HEATHERS in terms of its portrayal of teenage sensibilities, its showcasing of wit and charm, and the relevance of its topical issues. Charisma Carpenter (the slutty but muy caliente Kendall Casablancas) comes on board semi-regularly to further bolster the Buffy connection. Alyson Hannigan shows up now and then as Logan Echoll's flighty sister, and even Joss Whedon does a cameo. More new blood surfacing are Steve Guttenberg (Woody Goodman) and Tessa Thompson (Jackie Cook), while Kevin Smith and Lucy Lawless show up for one episode each. But the standouts continue to be Enrico Colantoni (Keith Mars), Jason Dohring (Logan Echolls), and, of course, Kristen Bell as Veronica. The relationship between Veronica and her dad (which is tested this season) continue to produce emotionally rich and satisfactory moments on television. Jason Dohring? Well, he's got that tortured, bad boy image down and he's really good with the caustic remarks, as he steadily turns biting sarcasm into an elevated artform.So, as you may have guessed, Season 2, like Season 1, is chock full of humorous one-liners and witty observations delivered with inspired dryness. I don't know if high school kids are actually this off-the-cuff funny and erudite, but I'll take it. The best line, for me, though, came from an adult, Keith Mars, who, upon photographing a potential troublemaker, warns him: ""The next time I shoot you, it won't be digitally. Unless I hit you in the finger; then, we'll have a laugh about it.""Not much to speak of with regards to special features. There are additional scenes, a gag reel, and 2 featurettes: ""A Day on the Set with Veronica Mars"" (Kristen Bell breaks down a typical shooting day) and ""Veronica Mars: Not Your Average Teen Detective."" The dvd package also comes with a booklet with episode guides.VERONICA MARS remains one of the best - and certainly one of the most addictive - shows on television and is a top fixture on my must see list. Veronica Mars, thanks to Kristen Bell's scintillating performance, is well on her way to becoming an iconic, pop culture figure. This season has the trademark plot twists and misdirections and is guaranteed to keep the viewer guessing and coming back. The final episode of this season truly CANNOT be missed. There, don't say I didn't give you a heads up."	5.0	"""A PONY!!"""	2006-10-22	7	6	1

We get to see more of Wallace and Weevil. Plus Joss Whedon makes an appearance!	5.0	2nd season almost as good as first	2010-03-02	0	0	0
B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2HNSKM52I20IQ	Heather Haven	Everything about this show works from the writing and acting down to the set and lighting design. Nothing is ever as it seems, people have hidden agendas, and storylines are interwoven with expert touches and with a noir bent. It would be short changing the series to say this is about modern day Nancy Drew, but for those not familiar with the concept, it's a starting point.	5.0	One of the sharpest and relevant shows depicting a youthful P.I.

Now, season 2, Kristen is 25 playing 17. Whoops. As of episode 2, the story line is not nearly as well done. Show is like, (why is this not on Nickelodeon)?

Don't have time to watch during the week, so love watching TV shows on DVD.  I just wish I had been as spunky as Veronica when I was in high school.  All the characters grow and change throughout the season. I love all the plot twists and turns.  Each week, Veronica solves some ""minor"" mystery and chips away at solving some season- lasting puzzler.  Big and small cast parts are played wonderfully, and Veronica frequently gets to exact revenge over someone who had 'wronged' her.

Others have written very detailed reviews of Veronica Mars, so I won't say much other than to reiterate that this show is in my top 3 of all time!  I watched the first episode and knew I had to buy the first 2 seasons.  I watched it all within 2 weeks.  My husband made fun of me for being so into it, but I made him watch the first episode to see why I love the show and he watched all the seasons within 3 weeks, as well (I watched them again, too).  Veronica Mars is just an incredibly well-written, perfectly-cast show with wit, intelligence, a strong female lead (Kristen Bell is amazing), clever plotlines, and enough suspense/drama to keep you up into the wee morning hours because you just HAVE to know what happens next!  We are 32 and 33-years old, btw, and we still loved this teenage/high school show!

It has now become one of our favorite things to watch.  It is a great blend of crime/mystery, comedy, drama and suspense that is a rare find these days.  We became so addicted to the first season (watching back-to-back episodes in any spare moments), that we thought we may get tired of it by season 2.  That didn't happen. We are still adoring the series and are anxious that only one more season exists.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A29RWALB7HOGPP	J. Burbano	I liked the show in the first season, early on, when she would solve different &#34;crimes&#34; every episode.  When it got to the main plot and the season long stuff, her relationships, friends, etc, it was like watching Bundy pick up alliances to his final goal.Unable to maintain a relationship - checkUses everyone - checkSuperficial charm - checkLiar - checkManipulative - checkLack of guilt - checkEmotionally shallow - checkDoesn't take responsibility of her actions - checkGets bored easily - checkImpulsive - checkIrresponsible - checkDelinquency - checkSlut - checkEventually by season two I go fed up and gave up on it.  I mean the whole best friend's murder plot was so unbearable. She blamed everyone along the way, and in her wake she left a lot of hurt people picking up the pieces after they were put under a microscope by others.  She felt no remorse in going all willi nilly pointing fingers, hell I wish her on.off again bf had jumped off the bridge too, maybe she'd feel a bit of guilt; then again probably not.Like I said, want to watch this, might as well pick up the unabomber's manifesto or any of the documentaries on Gacy or Gein.	2.0	It's enjoyable for the day to day sleuthing, but the overall plot is annoying, unless you are a fan of sociopaths	2014-01-24	3	1	2

As usual, executives at the network (CW) would rather program some meaningless drivel in its place and cancelled the show after three seasons . The good news is we at least had three seasons and a film a decade later due to the fan base. As addictive a show as 24 or any other fan / critical favorite for its time. Where the film version of Nancy Drew failed to generate an audience this show succeeded for three seasons and a film with flying colors. If they were smart, Amazon would invest in the further adventures of Veronica Mars as a a mystery wheel  movie of great actors and scripts . This way you get a taste and build an audience / following. Two or three films a year . The show has a built in base so tap into it.	5.0	Great Show, Premise, Acting and Storylines.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1WYGD6HJPCG0C	Jenny Deutschendorf	Veronica Mars is such an intelligent and witty show. Every time I watch the episodes I catch something new. T.V. bores me now, so I don't really watch much of it. But popping in a Veronica Mars DVD satisfies my craving to relax in front of the tube. I've never enjoyed a show this much. It's definately worth buying the entire 1st and 2nd season. You bet I'll be buying the 3rd season when it comes out.	5.0	The best TV show there is.	2007-01-09	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A35CBVTM1J0FCX	"J. Hargrove ""The Other Jim Hargrove"""	Once we started watching Veronica Mars, there was no turning back. We've been binge viewing an average of 3-4 episodes a day. This season the back story deals with the bus crash that killed several children. The culprit is revealed in the final episode and was a surprise. Meanwhile, each episode has two often interlocking stories: one about Veronica, the other about her father Keith. The plotting is clever, and the dialog is snappy.Although probably best for young adults, who will identify better with the heroine, it works for all ages.	4.0	Not quite as good as Season 1, but still good	2014-04-02	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2CTEJ3CX9W2LS	Jim Austin	Nancy Drew mysteries were a refreshing and entertaining change in the popular genre dominated by men (and elderly women). But, like much of the entertainment of the time, Nancy was rather superficial and two-dimensional. Veronica Mars is also refreshing, but is a multidimensional and real character dealing with real issues and problems, both within her social environment and within herself. Among other things, this series deals with stereotypes that are magnified in the ultra-stratified community of Neptune.Often attempts to refute stereotypes are done with characters who are equally two-dimensional opposites of the stereotype, but this series presents multidimensional characters (including Veronica). Veronica is an intelligent and complex character, and the people she deals with are equally complex and often surprisingly unpredictable. TV and the mystery genre need more Veronica Mars's.	5.0	Veronica Mars: Nancy Drew Brought To Life	2014-05-23	0	0	0

A very minor wondering:  Veronica never wears the same clothes twice and while they're all catchy, one wonders how the cash-strapped family can afford so many nifty little jackets, but absolutely minor point.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A63ZA449E3AK2	"John K. Beaver ""buffy fanatic"""	"If season two of ""Veronica Mars"" doesn't quite live up to season one, it realy doesn't matter - it's still spectacular television. The mystery of season two manages to hit close to home for everyone, and the suspects are rampant throughout, leaving you guessing right up to the finale. My biggest complaint is that Wallace seems to get lost in the mix of the expanded cast (this was a much bigger problem in season 3). Kristen Bell puts in another superb performance, giving us glimpses of the sometimes sad, always guarded, but inherently sweet soul that lies beneath Veronica's brash, snarky and wip-smart exterior. If Jason Dohring's Logan isn't quite as much fun as season one, he at least seems to grow up. Best of all is Enrico Colantoni's Keith, who took over the role of best TV dad from ""The OC""'s Sandy Cohen during season one and keeps going strong in season two, loving his daughter unconditionally yet constantly fearing that she might not turn out alright, that the dark goings on in Neptune might damage her for good."	5.0	I miss it already	2007-08-06	1	1	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3GRN6J64F2C3X	Joseph P. Menta, Jr.	"I loved the first season of ""Veronica Mars"", and ultimately loved season two, as well.  As I progressed through the season, though, there was a little cattiness and sneering amid the love.  Why?  Ah, just some small things...A coffee house?  Veronica now works in a freakin' coffee house?  It just felt like a cheesy attempt to make the show feel a little more like all the other youth dramas out there.  The development wasn't totally horrible, but we could have lived without it.Some choppiness.  Characters and situations were introduced and dropped with little or no explanation.  Why exactly did Wallace have to leave for several episodes to be with his dad if little was done with the idea?  And was there ANY explanation for Veronica's dad and Wallace's mom suddenly not seeing each other anymore?  If the explanation was there it was REALLY quick.Though still compelling, the bus crash and the ""Is Logan guilty of murder"" season-long plotlines weren't as immediately dramatic as the ""Who Killed Lilly Kane?"" plot from the previous year.  But I guess what plot arcs COULD match that great first year?Okay, enough ranting about the quibbles.  What was great about the season?  Lots of stuff.  Here's a sampling:The show was as clever as always.  I loved one episode where Veronica was suddenly acting all soap opera-ish and heartbroken over Duncan, making me yell at the screen about how the quality of the writing had suddenly dropped into the basement.  But then we learn that there was a REASON Veronica was acting like a bad piece of melodrama from ""90210"".  They got me!Once again, the creators give us credit for being smart enough to keep up.  As in season one, the solutions to the individual stand-alone episodes are quickly rattled off and not spoon fed to us.  You have to pay attention.Though I felt there was more of a ""making it up as they went along"" feel to this season, I have to admit that the exciting and well-organized last episode once again neatly wrapped things up.  If things WERE created more on the fly during the course of this season, the writers certainly brought all the strands together in the end.In the end, I guess I feel that the first season of ""Veronica Mars"" easily leaped over the wall into ""excellent show"" territory and this second season had to work a little to pull itself over that wall to get into that same territory.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2NVII9XHNW5U8	JR	This is not an average show about high school drama and problems, which quickly bore me. I graduated high school myself many years ago, and I am no longer interested in watching that kind of interaction as entertainment. Veronica Mars, however, is creative, funny, and engaging. The show has significant plot and character development. The overarching plot of the show does not change, but the focus of the show does change enough that I do not find the episodes repetitious or boring. I look forward to having the time to watch the next episode. I would recommended this show for anyone who is looking for television that will both engage to their intellectual side, and that will also be relaxing, fun break.	5.0	Witty, fun, clever  - not your average teen drama	2014-03-05	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A36KC3CTSJ9I5S	"J.

The writing is smart and funny, the characters complex and endearing (some inexplicibly).  Season 2's shocking ending is something I strongly doubt ANYONE truly saw coming.Honestly, I thought I was done with ""high school shows"", after Buffy ended, so in that sense I can relate to the general reaction to this show by the average adult.  If it weren't for Joss's recommendation, I never would've discovered this wonderful series and I am beyond glad that I did!"	4.0	Perfect for anyone who likes great writing, fascinating characters and a good mystery!	2006-11-09	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A10UZVULYFWB8U	J. Witt	"Season 1 of Veronica Mars took me by surprise, and I really enjoyed the ride.  The second season, however, doesn't live up to the quality of the first.  Instead of one large mystery, in season two viewers are treated to several smaller mysteries to solve.  There's nothing wrong with that approach, but it seemed that as fast as one mystery skien got solved, another would pop right up without any resolution for the first.  Many episodes ended with my friends and I turning to one another and asking, ""Is that it?  Where's the rest of it?""  This happened quite a bunch, with the child abuse investigation episode as perhaps the most jarring.  Are we really supposed to believe someone as determined as Veronica would just pick up and call it quits because she gets a slap on the wrist?  That's totally out of character, yet we never see that family, the abused girl, or hear about the incident again.That type of confusion and weak plot points kept popping up.  The ""major"" villain of the season comes out of left field to be the murderer, and his motivation for murder ends up being really weak and unbelievable.  Because of the all the loose ends, go-nowhere plots, and the surprise villain who was probably a surprise to the writers up until deadline, I'm giving Season 2 a 2 star rating.  Season 2 of Veronica Mars still has some funny dialogue, and some clever episodes, but it doesn't deserve all the 4 and 5 star reviews I've seen.  I'll continue to watch, however, as Veronica Mars has a lot of promise.  Hopefully the producers can get things in gear for season 3!"	2.0	A Disappointing Sophmore Season	2006-11-20	19	6	13

I anxiously popped the first DVD from Season 2 into the machine to begin my usual workout and much to my dismay found that even though the shows are in English, the subtitles are only in Spanish and French.  Season 1 and Season 3, however, have English subtitles, furthering confusing the issue of ""what were they thinking?"".  What is with that?

As a parent, I would not recommend this series for young teens. It may well have more reality to it than I would like but I still feel that our young people shouldn't think that under age drinking, promiscuity, drugs, and violence are &#34;cool&#34;.	3.0	Good Stories for Adults	2014-04-21	0	0	0

Overall, I think the 2nd season is the best of the 3, but it's only by an edge.Quirky, snarky, complex, smart, and honest. The show is willing to tackle some hard problems that society still struggles with today- social class problems, rape, friendship and betrayal, romantic love, hidden secrets, and more. It's got a few shows that could have been ripped from headlines recently, not just from when it was written.If you like snarky, complex characters and mysteries, VMars is probably right up your alley.	5.0	One of my favorite...	2014-03-21	0	0	0
B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2OUX4XDOHABG6	"K. Cheung ""Chance"""	I was surprised how good of a show this was. I read all the reviews and I thought I would give it a try. Most of the characters are excellent, but some can be annoying, but overall the whole cast is great. I think everyone should at least give this series a chance and watch it. You will not be disappointed. The only disappointment you will get that the show is no longer on.It is a shame that it took me this long to watch it and now the show is off the air	5.0	Great Series.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3I26CMFVJVGS4	kding	Watched this series when it was newly minted. Enjoyed it then, enjoying streaming it even more now with no commercials and as many episodes at a time as we want to watch. Nice to see a teenage girl fighting the system, using her brain and not giving in to the crazy social high school scene - and solving murder mysteries at the same time! Her dad is a great character too, smart loving and funny. Supporting characters are very interesting especially Logan, the evil/pitiful little rich boy who just can't stay out of trouble.	5.0	Love that Mars girl	2014-04-08	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3TMV537WPVP2Y	"Keith Grant ""Gymreject"""	Veronica Mars is no longer made, but even so it still has to be one of the best series to come out of the USA. The second series is as brilliant as series one & three - (equally must haves for your DVD collection). It's concept is a mix between a female Sherlock Holmes meeting Beverly Hills, 90210. Veronica Mars is played by Kristen Bell who gives a blow away performance supported by an equally talented supporting cast. The writing is also in a league of its own and the quality of production is far above the norm. The one-liners coupled with the strong characters  guarantees a great viewing experience. The series finished due to not having enough viewers. This was mainly due to very little publicity and having its US schedule changed weekly. It lasted for one more series, and considering the crap that is commissioned by the same US television network, it should have gone on for many more years. I have loaned my three box sets to friends who cannot believe they had never heard or seen this brilliant series in the UK. I guarantee once you start watching this show you will be hooked and very disappointed it is no longer in production.	5.0	The brilliant Veronica Mars series	2009-02-04	0	0	0

You just can't wait for a new episode.  Now my husband's parents have borrowed it.When it comes out I might buy 2 sets so I can watch one and loan one out.I really hope Veronica Mars is a long lived show and the networks don't make the mistake of dropping it without promoting it (like Firefly & Wonderfalls).	5.0	Addicting, love it!!!	2006-08-17	9	7	2

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A30TK6U7DNS82R	Kevin Killian	"We spent a week or so watching all the second season's episodes, as many as we had time for every evening after work.  And still we wound up confused and bewildered by some of what we were watching, for every episode is so rich and dense the mind cannot hold all the information we needed to remember from show to show.  At first we felt stupid.  OK, I feel still stupid, but surely there has never been a TV show so packed with incident and action, not to mmention so many script pages and pages of sharp, witty, incisive dialogue.  I wonder if even leading actress Kristen Bell understands the nuances of everything she's been led through.  At first, we told ourselves that Season 2 isn't as compelling as Season 1, for it lacked the intriguing and heartbreaking circumstances which led Veronica, when first we met her at the beginning of her junior year, to be the pariah and punching bag of the whole school.  First an ""O-Niner,"" then a nothing.  And in season two, the case of the school bus tumbling into the sea didn't seem that it would mean as much of Veronica as the death of her best girlfriend, Lily Kane.Yet soon it became clear that Veronica feels just as much guilt about not being on that schoolbus on the way home from the Sharks game, as she did about not being able to save Lily from being murdered.  The school bus thing is a vivid symbol of how much Veronica, by the tyranny of class, belonged on that bus, and how she's been whoring herself out by dating first Duncan, then Logan.  ""Rich dude kryptonite,"" Dick Casablancas calls her, and the insult cuts her both ways.By the way, did the actor who plays Wallace have something else to do for the second quadrant of the season?  And the actor who plays Duncan--he also must have been filming a movie or taking a vow of celibacy in a monastery.  Cause he just disappears, which is great for Logan lovers.  Logan Echolls, the boy you love to hate, gets more and more of a chance to shine in Season Two and after awhile, you just give in.  He and Veronica seem born to be together.  When they're apart, it's like magnets being ripped out of their respective fields.Not even THE WIRE has a plot so rich and multilayered.  Minor characters from season one pop up in season two and expand their performances in exciting, sometimes comical ways.  In fact characters from other shows (e.g. Willow and Cordelia from BUFFY and ANGEL) show up on VERONICA MARS in roles that seem like Shakespearean variations on the selves they used to inhabit.  If you stick it out to the end, Season 2 has a shocking finale you will never guess beforehand, and it's one that wraps up one of the mysteries of Season One you didn't even suspect invented.  From what we hear, Season Three of VERONICA MARS, on its new hybrid network the ""CW,"" is slated to be dumbed down with smaller narrative arcs and more ""stand-alone"" episodes.  Pity, that."	5.0	Rich Dude Kryptonite	2006-09-10	3	3	0

I have to admit that Season 1 was better than Season 2, but the writing is still smart, witty, and hilarious.  Kristen Bell is an amazing, talented, and funny actress.  Jason Dohring is just as cool, not to mention endearingly hot.

Unlike other mystery shows (Lost), this show has realistic mysteries. Every episode gives the viewer another clue to solve the season's mystery. This season, Veronica tries to find out who caused a school bus that she was supposed to be on to go off a cliff and crash into the ocean. Veronica Mars is smart and hilarious, with each character having more than their fair share of awesome one liners. This show never disapoints!

I adore the characters and the relationships especially Veronica and Logan and Veronica and her father.  I was hooked from the pilot episode.

Warner Brothers and CW will be getting a letter from me.It's a great show but they're not giving me or other hard of hearing/deaf fans the opportunity to enjoy season 2 as much as others do, so I'll go and spend my money on something I can actually watch and enjoy.	1.0	NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES OR CLOSED CAPTIONING	2007-05-15	47	35	12

I had been a fan of the series and was so disappointed when it was cancelled.  I backed the kickstarter and plan on going to watch the movie on opening day.  I wanted my husband to go with me but he just didn't get it.  He thought it was a &#34;girl&#34; show that he wouldn't enjoy and wasn't really into the idea of any of it.  I wanted him to be as excited about the movie as I am, so I made him watch the show with me, one episode at a time, while we eat dinner.  As we get near the end of the second season, he sings along with intro song and grieves with me that there were only 3 seasons of this amazing show featuring these awesome characters.  Veronica Mars is one of the best shows of all time, and liked by almost everyone that gives it a chance.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2PK4E6BCM4VYV	Lauren	I give it a 3/5 just because of the fact that the show is good. I have had the 1st season for a long time and I am just now getting this second season. I watched this when i was younger so It is a good continuation from the 1st season. 1st season is best in my opinion so far.The bad:What's up with the horrible packaging of the discs? Maybe its because this is a old show and packaged back then, but it is from my experience that have the discs on top of each other like that isn't the brightest and most consumer friendly way of holding the discs. 2 of the discs will not even stay in place! They keep falling out. Thank goodness that there is an outside box  that you slide off because the discs would just fall right out when I pick the product up. Its also silly having to take a disc to be able to put one behind it.Good season, bad packaging. 3/5	3.0	Good show, bad packaging	2013-01-30	0	0	0

The sarcasm, wit, humor, and realness are superb. I love how the characters evolve and how Veronica in particular is such a strong female, but also has her very emotional moments. The story lines are layered and you're constantly getting thrown curve balls and learning new things. It's a shame that the show only lasted three seasons because it is one of the best shows I have ever watched.	5.0	Fantastic Show	2014-02-08	0	0	0

The relationships that have been formed over the two seasons are wonderful.  The love and friendships these teens share is remarkable.Rob Thomas draws you in with a mystery and then follows up the mystery with interpersonal communication.

In season 2 the concepts and resolutions are still fresh. Good acting, dialogues, and a moving story keep it all enjoyable to watch. Having a smart young woman go against the mainstream and become a victor for  good was played well, long before Hunger Games, and Divergent figured out the model.	5.0	Clever writing	2014-03-24	0	0	0

The first season ended on a cliffhanger.  In this second season, there are the usual plot twists and turns that you don't expect.  It's Veronica's senior year and she just wants a normal life.  That's not going to happen at Neptune High, or with these writers.  This is a fun series that is well-written, original and well-acted.	5.0	Suspenseful, Addictive Second Season	2014-03-26	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1YS5IA6IPK2YS	"Lora ""22"""	"I LOVED THIS SHOW!!Veronica Mars is my new favorite show, right under Wonderfalls, the two shows have a lot in common esp. with having a witty, smart heroine.I watch the first season through the box set which had me hook right away. VM's humor and drama will draw you in, along with the clever ways the writers come up with for Veronica to solve the mysteries. Except for a few common elements, like background checks, after two seasons the show has not been repeative with its mysteries or the ways Veronica solves them.With Season 1 already out on dvd and The Season 2 boxset coming out this August -- go out and watch this show!!!This show is original and smart. VM, like Wonderfalls, is so much better than most shows out there and deserves all the support it can get. So please watch this show and I hope, like me, you'll be tuning in for Season 3 on the CW next fall!!Scene: Veronica is inspecting a bad tire on her car.Troy walks up - ""Flat?""Veronica: ""Just as God made me.""Keith: (her father): So how was your date?Veronica: Oh, you know.

Proving that the sophmore slump can be beat, season 2 has more compelling twists and turns than season 1.  The cast dynamics are even tighter in season 2, showcasing the well-oiled machine the cast has become.  This smart high-school drama where adults play a vital role in events large and small is must see TV in our household.If you haven't started watching this show yet, start from season 1 or you'll miss a lot, but definitely start watching this smart, funny, and engrossing drama.  It's got lots to recommend it to viewing audiences of all ages.The season 2 DVDs are a great way to relive the season or get caught up with this show which is in the midst of its third engrossing season.

Not bad television, but no where near as wonderful as it's generally purported to be.If you like teen angst, you'll enjoy it.  If you are a stickler for details or you find yourself irritated by teenagers making pop-cult references to the 80s that are more indicative of a writing staff in their 30s and 40s than to anything actual teenagers would say, you'll probably find yourself annoyed.Not awful.

Why the CW cancelled a show that had and continues to have such a strong fanbase is beyond me (considering the junk they cancelled it for too). The writing is fantasic and the casting is spot-on. When I found out the movie release date for the movie I decided to have a 'Veronica Mars' marathon that I completed yesterday and now am forced to wait two weeks for the movie! Here's hoping it is popular enough to warrant a 2nd movie. I did not re-watch the first half of season one so I'm not sure if it takes more than one episode from the start to be hooked but I say you should give it a try and let me know!	5.0	Highly Reccomended	2014-02-24	0	0	0

One day I caught a couple of episodes on Soap.net and next thing you know I am programming the DVR. Then my cable company dropped Soap.net and I was super irate. Luckily, it was not long before PRIME had all three seasons available. I caught up and pieced together what I had missed of each season just in time for the Veronica Mars Movie, which was also on PRIME. This is probably one of the best shows ever, the witty dialogue and snarky factor is awesome.

This show is a must for any teacher, middle and highschool student. It is fun, extremely witty, sad, poignant, classy, exciting, thought provoking and gutsy. This series will always be a favourite of mine. I have to say my 10 year son loves this show, not sure if the attraction is Kristen Bell or the show itself!Highly recommended. If you have never seen it give it a go even though it only runs for three seasons, it is worth every minute.	5.0	Veronica Mars Season 2	2007-08-29	1	1	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A275WJBGGUHC89	Marilyn M. Green	This was an interesting series because it didn't play everyone as stereotypes. Veronica is a high school student who works for her dad who happens to be a former sheriff but now works as a private detective. The relationship between parent and child is complicated but always loving. Neither Veronica or her dad are perfect. Veronica bends the rules to achieve results that she feels are morally right. As a high school student she is shown studying for exams but her world is so much more complicated than being a student. She has to deal with her first love and how she handles that relationship. She encounters so many dramatic situations but it is how she manages to deal with her life that makes this series engrossing. The rest of the young cast are not classed solely as bratty or perfect. The supporting cast is just as complicated so that there are many surprises when a character does not act as expected but shows more depth to a response. I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys mysteries solved by a perky detective.	5.0	Veronica Mars	2014-03-06	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	After solving her best friend's murder at the end of season 1, Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) swore off detective work.  She was going to relax and enjoy her senior year.  In fact, she's got a boring job serving coffee.  Just your typical high schooler.Unfortunately, just when she thinks she's out, she's pulled back in.  Firstly, on again off again friend Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is accused of killing a PCHer.  Then best friend Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is part of the group of starting athletes accused of steroid use.But worst of all is the bus crash.  After a routine field trip, the bus the kids were riding in plunges over the side of a cliff, killing all on board.  The rich kids had gotten off, so once again social status plays an issue.  But worse yet, Veronica thinks it was intended to kill her.  Was she the target or was there another sinister purpose?This show started off with a strong first season and only improved with this one.  The writing is as sharp as ever.  Not only did the season long storylines keep me guessing from start to finish, but the individual mysteries that only last one episode were full of twists and turns as well.  In addition to the great plotting, the dialog is fast moving.  Veronica's sarcasm, both in dialog and her voice over narration consistently cracks me up every week.Building on the great writing is equally strong acting.  All of the actors take the wonderful words they are given and nail it every week.  Kristen Bell receives lots of praise for her work here, and it is well deserved.  She consistently hits all the peaks and valleys the role demands, and makes it look effortless.  Equally praise worthy is Enrico Colantoni in his role as Veronica's Dad.  Their scenes together are the heart of the show, and I love watching the two of them together.While the first season set contained little in the way of extras, this one does include some.  There are 22 minutes of deleted scenes, a gag reel, and two behind the scenes featurettes.  All this is on top of wide screen picture and surround sound.  If you are a fan of this show, this set is not to be missed.And if you aren't a fan of this show, what's wrong with you?  There's still time to get up to date on a great show and be ready to start season three when it premiers in a few weeks.	5.0	A Great Show Only Gets Stronger	2006-08-29	63	58	5

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A31USHNZ2A3R6A	"Marshall Robertson ""If the apocalypse comes, ..."	I don't know about you guys, but I absoulutely adored this season. Coming from the magnificent first season was a tall order in itself, and despite some flaws, the second season is a success. The main problem being that the second season was planned over the course of a couple of months, as opposed to Rob Thomas' (probably) whole life when he planned season one as a novel. Knowing that, the writers managed to give us even more exitement than before. You can look to other reviews for the plot details, I'm just a big VM fan who's voicing the fact that season two deserves a second look, and has more to it than meets the eye. Sure, it might seem a little bit TOO much, and the many (seems like gazillion) plot lines tend to wear a little thin, but they wanted to expand the VM universe, and for the most part, they succeeded. A great successor to the first season!	5.0	Underrated is the watchword.	2011-09-13	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A29VKY2MWI8WRP	mcpal	In Series 1, Veronica's appeal came from her being an intelligent, alert, adolescent. In Series 2, she's becoming &#34;older, harder, and less appealing. She seems out of place. The reasons for her being unpopular are disappearing. She used to be out of sync with her peers...a virgin, studious, nongossipy. Now she's lost her uniqueness. Her language sounds like a college student's as she adds damn, hell, crap, etc. to her vocabulary. Not enough motivation for her to like Logan, even less Duncan, the wuss. You need a female writer who liked her high school days, was popular, valedictorian, and got scholarship to Ivy League school to give insight into Veronica's role. Woody needs more foreshadowing...he's sort of a doofus character, innocuous, and bland, then turn to be so evil! The characters you give time and thought to...Logan's father, Veronica's father...work well.	3.0	Keep Veronica young and female	2014-02-03	1	0	1

And I, haven't stopped thinking about her since we first met.  Veronica Mars is a television show that combines excellent writing, acting and filmography.  The concept of having a season wide arc-mystery while each individual episode shows television slueth goddess on the job digging in and solving minor crimes is an excellent hook.  Character development, the soundtrack, and snippy, sassy comebacks we only wish we could think of in the moment propel the title character and all the supporting cast in to greatness.

BUT it is actually one of the most intelligent detective shows i've ever watched.

This isn't just a typical teen show by any means. There is more going on in one episode of Veronica Mars than most shows have in five. The bus crash mystery unravels all season long and there are plenty of other ""mysteries of the week"" to keep everything interesting.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1DOX2H6TG2MHB	"Morgan sokalski ""vm-world.livejournal.com"""	"Veronica Mars is easily the best show in the history of television. Everything about it screams ""amazing"". Everything from the writing, acting, directing to the score, music selection, symbolysm to the action, mysogny, mis-direction, this show rocks.The twenty two episode set of Veronica Mars should deffinitly be put on your wish list at least, as it is even better then the first season. Many new characters and twists are introduced but all of the elements and continuity from the first season remain in place.It's almost unbelievable all of the little details that are present in each episode which is why I think it would be awseome to watch all 22 episodes, back to back, over say a week or something like that.Trust me. Even if you haven't seen the first season, you can still pick up certain aspects of the show if you watch every episode of the second. You won't regret purchasing this dvd, and remember that season three of Veronica Mars starts on the new CW network in September. Be there to watch and support it so that when season three DVD's come out, there are a full 22 episodes in it."	5.0	Veronica Mars... best show in the history of television.	2006-05-07	13	11	2

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1DULQZ48N2L89	mr2686	Let me tell you how good Veronica Mars is.  After finishing up Season 1 at around Midnight, I couldn't help but watch the first couple of episodes of season 2. After that, I was through with season 2 in a day and a half.  Great plot twists and turns, great writing, and sassy and smart dialog.  It's rare that a sophomore season is as strong as the first, but this one is.  I'd rate them about equal but I could see where individual taste could put one over the other.  My only problem is I waited too long to order season 3 and now have to wait till this afternoon before it arrives.  How will I survive without the gang from Neptune!	5.0	Season 2 just as good as season 1.	2013-03-28	0	0	0

Why it never caught on his more than I can fathom, but you can't say the CW didn't try.  This show never had the ratings (and on any other station would have been cancelled after a few episodes), but they gave it three outstanding season to find its niche.  Unfortunately, it never did.Hopefully others will one day discover what those of us smart enough to watching during its original run already know:  that this is one of the best written shows ever to grace a television set.	5.0	Probably my favorite season of the short-lived classic	2008-01-19	1	1	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	AFIS5X5CNUQLK	"M. Roth ""Random Mystic"""	I adore this show and I was really looking forward to the DVD set.  I buy many tv shows on DVD because I love the backstory.  I want to hear why the producers and writers made the choices they did, I want to hear about the arcs and all the background on making a tv program.  The extra with Kristen Bell was great but there were no commentaries.  I am still a big fan of the show but there wasn't enough extra on the DVD set to warrant the price.  I can record the show on TV and have pretty much the same thing.	2.0	No extras	2007-01-11	5	1	4

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A23B8KH04MEXU6	M. Tucker	Without the focus of solving Lily Kane's murder, the show if anything gets more interesting.  The problem may be that Veronica herself is too interesting:  what eighteen-year-old really talks like this?  She sounds like an intelligent and very witty thirty-five year old steeped in the pop culture references of that generation, even with the occasional allusion to, say, Radiohead.  And really:  who is this smart?  Not that I'm complaining.  I was riveted to the screen till I ran out of discs.	4.0	Veronica Mars Season 2 on DVD	2006-11-06	2	2	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2KEKPMI3WQMPA	"pancake_repairman ""pancake_repairman"""	I was totally looking forward to watching the second season of Veronica Mars but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. I think you really need to watch it twice to understand most of what's going on because the writing doesn't direct your attention to a lot of the things that you're supposed to take note of that become relevent later on. It's more immediately concerned with having Veronica always following dead-end leads to keep the mystery going, so by the time she actually gets on the right track you don't know what pieces of information are still relevent. Like in episode 1 when Veronica asks her dad to look up the shareholders of Boatloads Of Fun Corp, I had no idea where she got that name from or why she thought they were involved. Watching it a second time I realised that one of the athletes who was framed for drug use mentioned earlier to Veronica that the company was sueing her parents, but it didn't register as a pertinent piece of information because at the time there didn't seem to be any reason to think they were a suspect.There are also moments of lazy writing that has characters behavior serving to progress a plot point without having any internal logic. Like the part in episode 1 where the cop shows up at Veronica's door to arrest Logan like he knows Logan is there and Veronica is harbouring him. If the cop thinks Logan is guilty of murder why would he assume Logan told Veronica anything about what happened on the bridge, and why would he assume Logan would more likely be at Veronica's than have just left town or even the country?Then there's the ipod switch in episode 3. Seemingly Veronica had the ipod she gave Kendall rigged to take pictures, but there's so much there that goes unexplained, like how Kendall wouldn't have immediately realised the music on the ipod wasn't hers and chased Veronica down to get hers back before she even left the gym, or why Kendall would have the ipod out in the open all day for it to take all those pictures when she was meeting with people, rather than putting it in a bag or her pocket or something.Then there's some things that just never make sense, like in episode 5 the sheriff is trying to blackmail Jackie's dad into buying 1000 tickets to an annual fundraiser. Apprently Terrence has gambling debts, but how exactly the sheriff or cop was using this against him remains unclear. It seems like the sheriff was threatening to tell his creditors his wherabouts, but if Terrence was hiding out from his creditors in Neptune why would he make a public appearance at the baseball stadium to talk to the students? And didn't his creditor later turn out to be the owner of a local casino? So if his debts were local anyway obviously he wasn't hiding out in Neptune. Maybe the cop was threatening to arrest him for illegal gambling, but if that was that case shouldn't the cop have shown what evidence he had?The characters even seem duller this time around. Veronica's Buffyesque sarcastic lines are still in effect, but in this season she's more conservatively righteous than the first season where her moral compass seemed to allow her more freedom to get the job done. Weevil looks about 30 and the kid who plays Wallace is about the least charismatic actor to ever disgrace tv screens.If you have an explanation for any of the things I've said don't make sense, post it.	2.0	Please enter a title for your review	2006-10-09	22	1	21

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2EVD67KDBACLG	Paul Jensen	I'd watched some of this series when it originally aired and decided to binge watch prior to the movie. I came away impressed with how great the acting and interactions worked. Sure it's a little tongue in cheek, but one really has to root for Veronica and appreciate the season long and even the episodic mysteries.  The father daughter relationship is great. Sure there is some teenage angst but it's more of a temporary diversion than the focus of the show. What I particularly like is how the show mixes emotional highs and lows with intermingled plot lines.  The cast is (almost) universally excellent. It strikes me that Kristen Bell is perfect for this role, with a cocky yet self deprecating confidence.	5.0	Great dialogue and plotting	2014-03-21	0	0	0

It is without a doubtthe most original show on television today (and hopefully will continueto be if the CW doesn't cancel it). In an age of television where weare inundated by crime and medical dramas and frivolous teen soapoperas, nothing holds a candle to Veronica Mars. The writing isexcellent and the acting is even better. Kristen Bell is superb as atough and spunky, but still human, leading lady. Her supporting cast isexcellent (Enrico Colantoni, Percy Daggs III, Jason Dohring, TinaMajorino) and the frequent guest stars range from highly creditedactors like Paul Rudd, Harry Hamlin, Steve Guttenberg, Sydney TamiiaPoitier, Ed Begley Jr., Lisa Rinna, and Alyson Hannigan to talentedunknowns.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3LIJVC1CVI3KN	Q61	The second season begins where the fist left off, but with some interesting differences. One of the hooks for the first season was Veronica as an outsider--a girl with mad skills but who was misunderstood and somewhat feared by those with whom she was not close friends ( and some of them).In ht Second season our V-girl has moved to a more normal role as a high school student that finds her true joy in investigating the lives and losses of those in her community. Although much different the series writers and producers do an excellent job with these transitions without losing the essence of who Miss Mars is.Not quiet as engaging as the first season, the second season still manages to engage the viewer with several ongoing subplots. Bad boys are not quiet as bad as they once were and good boys find a bad side as we mover through the season.Overall, you will certainly not be wasting your time by watching the series and should have some fun watching some of the supporting characters develop throughout the season--enjoy!	4.0	An Outsider no more	2014-05-02	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3U2TF9EHH81NY	rachel halloran	Veronica is back for another year of high school and everything is turned upside down from where we were left at the end of the first season. This season is harder on V emotionally and the major overarching case affects everyone in Neptune. Not quite as amazing as its freshman year, it still was and remains better than 99% of all TV shows for its plot twists, characters development, and sassy dialogue. Rob Thomas has a genius way of rotating the minor characters where you always welcome them back with open arms, while creating large enough roles and personalities that you don't miss them when they are absent. It's an odd thing to think about,  but watching each of the three seasons makes that statement completely understandable. I'm excited for the movie next month! I've watched from the start and cannot wait for the movie! For my friends who somehow missed out on the awesomeness of Veronica the first time, and every time I've attempted to sit them down to make them watch this, they become just as hooked as me. It's also brilliant that both guys and girls watch this show, it is not simply a chick flick drama. Hope you all enjoy the movie, but watch the show first. Every single episode, it's so worth it. Now I sound like a L'Oreal commercial.Sidenote: There is something very magical that happens between this cast. It means something to me that they were able to bring back every major character and what I am assuming is every minor character so many years later (the show was cancelled in 2006). They believe in Veronica Mars as much as its fans do. I know for a fact that you cannot say that for most TV shows. Just another way that Veronica Mars is simply one of the best.	5.0	Favorite Show of All Time	2014-02-04	0	0	0

You can't help but feel superior with all the rich white trash, the poor brown trash and the poor white trash killing, molesting, having illicit sex with and stealing from or swindling each other.  There are always mysteries for Veronica to solve, usually a single episode one, a multi-episode one, and a season long one.Veronica is deliberate and delightfully devious, universally disliked but begrudgingly respected by all including her principal and the local law.

From the cameos (Kevin Smith, Joss Whedon - it was like a ""geekgasm"" for me), to the great storylines (stand-alones and season-long arcs), to the characters (Logan, even better in this season than last, Duncan, who I actually liked, Kendall (and that great scene when Allyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter get all bitchy with each other - it was like old Buffy times!) and even Beaver! Kristin Bell's acting is unbelievable and why she doesn't get nominated for an Emmy is beyond me!One of the best things has been to watch it with her and see her discover all the great things about the second season with her. All the twists and fantastic character moments. All the heartbreaks and laughs. God this show is amazing!A word about the DVD packaging itself: nice. It's a more tight system and the extras are packed with stuff. A lot better than the first set. Not to mention the sound and the transfer look great!

It's not only clever, and well written, it is littered with so many obscure pop culture references, you'll need it on DVD to rewatch. Like listening to a Public Enemy album and trying to identify all the samples. (Wallace's obsession with cake is a nod to Twin Peaks, for sure). It's a great series to discover on DVD because you can get the instant gratification of going from a cliff hanger right into the next episode (and no commercials!) Our record was six episodes in one night. Perfectly written and perfectly cast. Why do people watch crap like ""2 1/2 Men"" when there is brilliance like this on TV??The Season 2 DVD set has much better extras than Season 1.

If you haven't already, check out Season One.Season 2 sees Veronica confronting lots of new cases. The mysteries of Season 1 are (mostly) solved. Veronica narrowly escapes a fatal bus crash that kills many of her classmates. Who did it? Spend the rest of the season finding out.Meanwhile, each episode has a very interesting plot of its own. Highlight of the season is when Veronica's boyfriend disappears with his daughter from another classmate, Meg, who barely survived the bus crash. Did he & Veronica just break up, or are they conspiring?The producer and many of the writers of Veronica Mars were also involved with the Buffy series, so expect plenty of wit, sarcasm, and surprising plot turns.	4.0	Fetching teen private eye, who always gets her man.	2007-01-11	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"NEWS UPDATE -- May 16, 2006:  Mike Ausiello of TV Guide has just posted that Rob Thomas e-mailed him that VERONICA MARS has been renewed for a third season and a full 22-episode order, that can be cut back to 13 if the ratings are low.  So get this DVD box set if you are a fan!  Lend it to friends!  Recruit new viewers!  Keep this great show alive!In its first season, VERONICA MARS established itself as one of the best new shows on TV and while it didn't attract many viewers, it nonetheless managed to gain a surprising amount of critical acclaim. First, Salon.com, in its annual salute on the best show neglected by the Emmys, awarded the Buffy (named for the most unjustly Emmy-neglected show of all time) to VERONICA MARS. Then, BUFFY's creator, Joss Whedon, wrote a review in Entertainment Weekly of the DVD release of VM. His memorable three-word summation: ""Best. Show. Ever."" Finally, at the end of 2005 a host of TV critics gave their lists of the Top Five or Top Ten or just Top shows on TV. Right there among shows like LOST and ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT was that Veronica show. And it deserved all the praise. As great as it had been in its first season, its second represented a great leap forward in the complexity of its narrative and the development of its characters.Unfortunately, what VERONICA MARS did not get was viewers. Despite the fact that pretty much the same people who would love VERONICA were those who love the mega-hit LOST, the geniuses at UPN decided to put this lovely show, which was still attempting to build an audience, against one of the highest rated shows on TV, targeted at much of the same group of people. There have been some astonishingly dumb decisions in the history of TV programming, but this definitely ranks up there. The results were predetermined: very few people watched VERONICA MARS. My two favorite shows on TV are VERONICA MARS and LOST. Weekly I was left with a dilemma. But let me confess this: after the halfway point in the season and before they moved VERONICA to Tuesdays, I found myself watching VERONICA MARS instead of LOST.Season Two largely centered around the mystery of what caused a bus crash in the very first episode, a bus crash that killed several of Veronica's classmates and a bus that Veronica would have been on except by sheer accident. Though there are a host of story arcs throughout the season, this is the central one around which the season as a whole is built. What delighted me was the wonderful complexity that evolved during the course of the year. One plausible culprit after another was introduced, one new clue after another, so that one week it seemed definite that one person was responsible for the crash, but another the following week. All the way up to the end I was concerned that perhaps things were getting too complex, but in the end things were resolved in wonderful fashion.In particular I want to praise two episodes. The finale, ""Not Pictured,"" was one of the finest season finales I have ever seen. There was a new shocker of some sort every five minutes to go with some of the most gut wrenching moments I have ever witnessed on TV. There were many moments that were almost too horrible to watch, so intense they were. The episode no only resolved the major plot arcs of Season Two, but also some unresolved ones from Season One. All in all, it was a thing of glory. I was also amazed by the episode ""Donut Run,"" in which Veronica matches wits with not only Sheriff Lamb (who is supposed to be an opening credits character in Season Three) but with two FBI agents, one of whom was portrayed by none other than Xena herself, Lucy Lawless. I indicated that I was going to keep this relatively spoiler free so I won't go into details, but I found this one of the most moving, exciting, delightful, and heart breaking episodes I've seen on TV. And it ends with a nod to its competitor in the same time slot, LOST, by ending with a close up of a note from a fortune cookie, which has just below the fortune Hurley's numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. On a similar note, two of my favorite shows had nods towards one another this season. On one of the final episodes of the comic masterpiece ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, George Michael asks Maebe if she would like to go watch [BLEEP] on TV. A subtitle explains that FOX had censored the name of a show on another network about a teen female detective. A few weeks later, on the episode ""The Grapes of Graff,"" Michael Cera, who played George Michael, appeared as a college tour guide, while Alia Shawkat, who played Maebe, portrayed a girl who was raped and had her head shaved, and who Veronica helps find her rapist.VERONICA MARS is the latest in a string of shows to appear in the past ten years to present female heroes. This is no longer as novel as it once was, which is a testimony to how effective these shows have been. Although the early part of the nineties saw Dana Scully on THE X-FILES and Xena on the show of the same name, it wasn't until BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER that girl heroes really began to be accepted in a big way. Compare this to the entire prior history of TV. Prior to Dana Scully, once you tick off Emma Peel (who still stands up as one of the great female heroes of all time) and Wonder Woman and the Six Million Dollar Woman (who do not), you have pretty much exhausted the list. But after BUFFY you get Aeryn Sun on FARSCAPE, Max Guevera on DARK ANGEL, Sydney Bristow on ALIAS, and River Tam on FIREFLY and SERENITY (we actually see in the latter what she would have become on the former). These women all do the things that male heroes can do, and it is irrelevant that it is unrealistic to have women doing super empowered things. We overlook that what male heroes are just as unrealistic. It is simply a convention that we buy Superman and Batman and the Green Hornet and Caine, and merely a bias that women doing similar things were unacceptable. I cracked up reading about a female anti-feminist philosophy professor who expressed outrage that feminists might want Wendy and not Peter Pan fighting Captain Hook, as if a boy who could fly and fight a pirate were somehow more lifelike. After Buffy, Wendy was free to take on Hook.Then came Veronica. Unlike Buffy, she is not super powered. Unlike Sydney and Aeryn, she wasn't trained from earliest childhood to be a super warrior. Unlike River and Max, she isn't genetically altered. She is just a girl. What is her super power? Her wits. She does what she does simply by being smarter better than anyone else. These female heroes (I am intentionally avoiding using ""heroine,"" which I think usually is employed to indicate less of a hero than a male version) have helped alter popular imagery about what women can and cannot do. Before Buffy and Max and Veronica, maybe popular culture could promulgate myths about a woman's proper place being in the home taking care of her kids, but not now. Or, stealing the title from one of Season Two's best episodes, now ""Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner."" Veronica is the ultimate 3rd Wave Feminist.What can you say about Kristen Bell? I honestly feel she deserves an Emmy nomination for Best Actress. She is an immensely gifted individual, and she doesn't even get to employ her singing and dancing skills (her background is in musical theater) on the show. She is a very tiny girl (I've read 5'1 in more than one place), but she is able to project so marvelously that it is almost impossible to believe that she is that small. She projects, ""Tough chick."" She makes you believe that she can take on an entire motorcycle gang and somehow come out on top. Or the combined forces of a sheriff's department and the FBI. Yes, she is as cute as a button, but it is her toughness and resilience that you love about her character. No matter how many terrible things happen to Veronica, she is like a cork that just pops back to the surface. She is backed by a great supporting cast. You have to love Jason Dohring as Logan Echols, one of the more complex, hard to predict characters on TV. He is also great at delivering the one-liners the writers give him. For instance, in one episode this season Veronica, wearing her restaurant uniform, rushes to get on an elevator, only to find Logan on it (this is at one of the periods where she and Logan are fairly hostile to one another).Logan: Hi ho.Veronica (mildly shocked): What?Logan: Hi ho, its off to work we go.The show contains reams of great dialogue like that. Another supporting character I want to mention is Enrico Colantoni, who excels as Veronica's father Keith. The two exhibit a rare father-daughter chemistry and comprise one of the great such relationships on TV. One character as hard to read as Logan is Weevil, played by Francisco Capra. Though he plays the ultimate outsider, Capra is the ultimate Hollywood insider, the grandson of studio exec Frank Capra Jr. and the great grandson of Hollywood legend Frank Capra.The BUFFY connections multiplied this season. Charisma Carpenter joined the show as a frequent guest star, playing Kendall Casablancas, a gold digger who seems a lower-class Cordelia Chase. It is certain that she will be back for Season Three (that is only a mild spoiler). Alyson Hannigan returned as Logan's sister Trina. There was even a moment when Kendall and Trina had an encounter. Hosts of fans were flashing on Willow and Cordy in the Sunnydale library. Finally, Joss Whedon himself did a cameo as an obnoxiously self-important rental car manager. Whedon wasn't the only celebrity to make a cameo. Early in the season director Kevin Smith played a fast food clerk, while the lead singers for both the Dandy Warhols (who perform ""We Used to Be Friends"") and Spoon sang on karaoke night in the restaurant where Veronica works (with Britt Daniel of Spoon appropriately singing along to Elvis Costello's ""Veronica"").On May 18th the CW-the result of a merge of UPN and the WB-will announce their new schedule. Though VM's ratings were terrible, the critical raves and the quality of the show seem certain to make this magnificent show one of the flagship shows on the new network. This truly is TV as good as it gets."	5.0	An already great show gets even better	2006-05-12	24	23	1

I went back to watch my DVD's recently and still enjoyed almost every minute.Veronica Mars is a high school girl and a part-time PI.  Last season, she investigated the murder of her best friends Lily (I strongly recommend starting with the series from the beginning especially at these new lower prices).  This time out the town is still reeling from finding out one of their rich and elite was a murder...and Veronica has to deal with the backlash of unearthing this fact.  This time around she investigates a bomb on a school bus that killed a number of students.The series still follows the format that worked so well last time out.  Most episodes involve both a case that is wrapped up in the single episode as well as an investigating clues to the season long mystery.For those of you who missed this outstanding series the first time around, I recommend you check it out.	5.0	Still a great show	2012-01-28	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A36S76UPF3VJY1	S. Apodaca	I gave the first season flying colors. This season just impressed me even more. I don't know what it is about the show that made me a such a huge fan. I'm sure it has a lot to do with the cast. The father and daughter relationship reminds me a lot of my situation. Maybe it's the chemistry that Kristen Bell seems to have with all her costars. Maybe it's her character's attitude and biting wit. I'm sure it has a lot to do with the writing. The Veronica Mars universe is a tangled web with a lot of little subplots. I'm sure I will end up watching this season again.	5.0	One of my all-time favorite shows	2014-04-30	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2NZDF1UEUQGOD	Sasja Frahm Olesen	I enjoyed the first season of Veronica Mars immensely, and was looking very much forward to season two.  But the lack of English subtitles has prevented me from watching the season even though I bought it.  As a non-native English speaker, I very often need to rely on the subtitles to follow the snappy dialogue, and while every tv series I ever bought to this point has had them they're apparently disappearing (missed them on the new Gilmore Girls dvd set as well).  The choice is now limited to French or Spanish, neither of which I understand.  Please, please put the English subtitles back in!	1.0	Love the show, but I need my subtitles, dammit!	2006-10-13	24	12	12

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2FR1MW7SJ0HRB	Scott Manning	So many shows that have a strong first season collapse during the sophomore run... the weight gets to be too much to bear.After such a great first season, I was a little nervous for Season 2... Wow, was I wrong.The show came out swinging... and carried a great story into a new season... and kept it addicting. I marathon'd the first season in 3 days, I couldn't stop... prying my eyes open, I had to watch just one... more... episode... and when it was done, I ate the second course like I was famished.Kudos to Rob Thomas and cast/crew for such an amazing show.

Also, I love Kristen Bell in House of Lies. The dialog is snappy, punny, sappy, and hilarious. The rapport between Veronica (Kristen Bell) and her Dad (Enrico Colantoni) is awesome. I never watched it when it first ran - but am so glad to have discovered it now. Sure, some of the story lines are over the top and the resolution borders sometimes on the ridiculousness, nevertheless, it is a refreshing, entertaining character-driven romp.	5.0	Veronica Mars - just discovered	2014-03-10	0	0	0

The first season was probably the most cohesive and the second season was pretty good too.  The third season was worth the watch as well but I noticed that there were more leaps and gaps that eventually led to more questions than answers as season 3 closed and season 4 became a &#34;no go&#34; as the show was cancelled.	5.0	V Mars is worth the watch	2014-01-28	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	AAULAGYRQMRQ	S. Nemati	With her friend's murder solved, Veronica tries to regain a sense of normalcy in her life. This season revolves around the people of Neptune as the town becomes more polarized. Its a bit lighter and funnier than the first season, but the show is still willing to tackle issues other shows in the genre would be afraid to explore.Unlike last season, this season Veronica is less of an outcast. Romance plays more of a central theme in this season and Veronica struggles to be more of an typical girl, with mixed results of course! There are several new characters in the cast (I didnt like all of them, honestly) and the B mystery revolves more around Weevil and Logan than Veronica. This one is a bit more convoluted than the previous season, but the power of the DVD allows you to follow it in order without the pesky commercials. Not quite as gripping as the first season, but still an entertaining and intriguing mystery... with another superb, nail-biter finale!	4.0	More Characters, More Complicated Mysteries, Same Lovable Veronica	2006-11-13	1	1	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A2SW82WTEME9XX	STL64	This show mixes a wonderful evocation of the pressures of high school in which class, race, and gender all come into play with extraordinarily clever dialogue. Kristen Bell does a masterful job in portraying the ways in which anger is sublimated. Veronica Mars tells us she dislike the 09ers but there is desire to be one as well. Some of the plot twists are far-fetched as the mystery of the bus crash winds its way to a conclusion, but the show is not realistic in that sense.	5.0	Subtle and Entertaining	2014-03-16	0	0	0

I am at end of season three and am going to be glad to be done.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3JIRI08ACWIIR	Susan C. Tekulve	A very smart, well-written show.  Its audience is supposed to be  teens or young adults, but I watched it to catch a glimpse of what my teenage son and my teenage students must experience.  I meant to watch one show, but I ended up watching all three seasons.  I found this series to be a mesmerizing study of contemporary social problems viewed through the lens of teens.  I also  felt that the show transcended a typical teen show because it did not patronize its viewers, or resort to juvenile jokes or stereotypes.  I also thought that the narrative construction of each episode was complex and compelling. The characters were well written, and the actors were excellent.	5.0	More Than Just Another Teen Show	2014-04-02	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	AYA9G03PHSRQX	Tintin	"Veronica Mars deceives those who, in a superficial glance, believe it is a one more escapist series of adolescents and their little existential problems artificially exaggerated.With its narrative inspired by ""noir"" films, with a critical and disillusioned vision of reality, the series serves as the B side of ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and many others of the genre. Or rather, uses this post-adolescent world to show what is hidden under the veil of hypocrisy in our daily relationships.Some may argue that a character like Veronica hardly existed in the real world, but this matters little, since the importance of character is precisely unravel the secret side of the American Dream. No one better than Kristen Bell, with his cheerleader face, aggressive controlled action and melancholy look combined with fine irony, to play the heroine.In the second season the series continues the excellent tying hooks, that bind us anxious to watch until the end. The only (and small) negative point, is the lack of short and smart introductions in flashbacks, present before each episode in the first season that helped us to follow the intricate plot."	5.0	The best-written series on television.	2011-10-30	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1T1QN0M9ORZVY	Tom Burger	The story line is engaging. The larger ensemble has continually drifted, while the core has been somewhat inconsistent. Blame the writers. The show is a great spotlight on the talented Kristen Bell; however, the Veronica Mars character is seriously flawed as a role model, due to two unseemly character flaws. One is her too-convenient disregard of laws somehow justified by her personal good intentions. The other is her cooperation with the story line's open invitation to an attitude of normalcy regarding teen sex.	3.0	This is no Nancy Drew	2014-02-26	0	0	0

The actors portray their characters with an amazing amount of heart and a clear dedication to the craft of acting.  I simply can't rave enough about this wonderful show and all who are connected with it's production.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A3K5RKQZERQRDW	Tracy Rodgers	"I couldn't be more excited about the Veronica Mars Season 2 DVDs, especially now that the third season on The CW is officially a go.After solving the murder of her best friend last year, all Veronica (the divine Kristen Bell) wants is a fresh start. ""Normal,"" she says. ""That's the watchword.""But things will never be normal for Veronica Mars, as she discovers before the end of the first episode of the season. The world she inhabits is a dark one -- it may be set in Southern California, but the reality doesn't match the sunny setting.  There are secrets. Secrets to be kept and protected at all costs. Secrets that could cost someone their life.And Veronica will find them out.As an assistant to her private investigator father (Enrico Colantoni), Veronica has methods of obtaining information that the average high school senior couldn't even imagine. Combined with a keen intellect and razor-sharp wit, Veronica could give Jack Bauer or Dr. House a run for their money.The entire cast is stellar, from Percy Daggs III as Veronica's best friend Wallace, to Francis Capra as motorcycle gang leader Weevil, to Tina Majorino (Napoleon Dynamite) as computer whiz Mac, to Jason Dohring as the sinister, sexy, snarky bad boy (and former flame of Veronica) Logan Echolls.Season 2 also features Charisma Carpenter and Steve Guttenberg, with notable guest appearances by Alyson Hannigan, Harry Hamlin, Kevin Smith, Joss Whedon, and Michael Cera and Alia Skawkat of 'Arrested Development' fame.I'd imagine that there have been other TV shows as good as Veronica Mars, but I've never found them.

There were just a few quirks that prevented 5 stars.  A few episodes were a little less exceptional than others.  Veronica Mars character and Logan's also had these great verbal comebacks.  A little too sophisticated for teenagers.  Also, Veronica's illegal actions in some of the episodes would have caused her to be expelled in real life, or worse.Kind of nitpicking, I know.

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	AHES0OJ63CXVR	Will	The second season of this amazing drama starts off three months after the events of the first but through fastbacks tells the events of the summer including the reveal of the cliffhanger from season 1. A mysterious crash of a school bus carrying several Neptune high a bus that Veronica was suppose to be on is the central mystery of the second season. Along with a mystery revolving a suspicious stabbing involving Logan and members of the PCHers.The second season adds some new and exciting characters to the cast. One is narcissic rich boy Dick Casablancas and his smart tortured little brother Cassidy (Beaver). Along with a new love intrest for Wallace, Jackie the sassy daughter of a rich and famous baseball player. While Veronica works on discovering who crashed the bus she also deals with day to day mysteries involving people at her high school.Changes also are afoot in Neptune as we say goodbye to a longtime character and a death of a heavily reccuring character from season 1 also Keith takes another shot at running for Sheriff after being asked to run by Steve Guttenburg's creepy character Woody the new mayor of Neptune. Everything comes to a head durring graduation when Veronica finally discovered who blew up the bus which leads to a standoff with said person and leads to a shocking conclusion. The second season is probably my favorite of the series with great moments and a wonderfully blended cast it truly is one of the best pieces of television i have ever seen and i highly recommend it.	5.0	"""In Neptune, nothing happens accidentally"""	2011-03-30	1	1	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	AAEYVYQO0131X	William Gray	"Season two was a let down for me after the first season.  The stories were disjointed and ludicrous even by high school sit-com standards.  The first season was choppy, but there was a sense of theme and episode story lines felt complete if often simplistic.  I was hoping for similar if not better in the second season, but instead there was a dramatic drop off in story quality.Kristin Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Jason Dohring continue to perform admirably.  They make this season watchable and provide the few stellar moments. But other actors turn in sketchy to downright lame performances.I found Percy Daggs' character to be much less interesting as a basketball star and would-be stud, but maybe he threatened to quit the show if they didn't let him ""grow up"".  He's okay, but just not very interesting.  Teddy (just another pretty face) Dunn turns in a weak performance as Kristin's heart throb, Duncan.The strength of the show is Veronica's wisecracking personality and her abilities as a detective.  The high school drama plotlines are necessary given the setting, but whereas the first season used the high school scenarios as a backdrop for the detective stuff, season two reverses that process.  Detective stuff takes a back seat to vapid high school melodrama that goes nowhere and makes little sense.In short, it's a disappointing sequel to the first season.  I start on season three soon, and while I hope for the best, I fear the worst.  Despite all the shortcomings of the show, I still watch because Kristin Bell is just so good.  Not because she's cute (which of course she is), but because she has a real ""star presence"" and she makes me care what's happening to her character.  If only they'd given her better scripts to work with.Too bad the producers and writers for this show didn't see Freaks and Geeks, a true masterpiece achieved in the same high school setting with similar high school dramas (minus the detective stuff).  Veronica Mars as done by the Freaks and Geeks people would have been one for the ages!"	2.0	Some great moments but as a whole a weak effort	2014-04-18	0	0	0

B000FL7CAK	Veronica Mars: Season 2	A1QTOBWTX0LVYM	"Woo Kim ""Woo K."""	"*Please note, if you have not seen Season Two and don't want me spoiling anything for you the viewer.  I suggest you rent Veronica Mars Season Two on Amazon.com on Demand, Netflix, or The Playstation Network.  If you don't care keep reading.The season picks up three months after the ending of season one when it is discovered Aaron Echolls murdered Lily Kane.  Much like the pilot episode there are a lot of flashbacks to went on during the three months after the solving of Lily's murder.  We find out Logan Echolls was the mystery person behind Veronica's door at the season one finale.  We also find out that Weevel's cousin Felix was stabbed by someone and throughout the season Logan is the assumed killer.  Another thing that season one and season two share is the big event.  Like the murder of Lily Kane which dominated season one as Veronica's huge case to crack (which actually gets wrapped up in a big way at the end of the season.)  Season Two's big event involves a school bus crash which takes the lives of seven people including Veronica's close friend Meg Manning who plays a bigger role than ever thought possible when we met her in season one.Veronica's love life gets into a Triangle ... like we didn't see that coming at the end of season one.  The two men fighting over her friends Logan Echolls and Duncan Kane.  This not being a pivitol arc I won't spend too much time with this for this reason.  It seems like filler, Veronica Mars has never been a series likeBuffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)where the title characters' love life is so important to the seasonal arc.What is important to Season Two's arc is the addition of new characters and or characters we met back at the tail end of season one.  Dick Casablancas (the name fits his character) who doesn't go through that many changes but has a small part to the bigger picture of Season Two.  Cassidy ""Beaver"" Casablancas (Dick's younger brother) who goes through a huge character growth in Season Two and actually becomes a huge player in the end of the season.  The new mayor Woody Goodman played by Steve Guttenberg ofPolice Academy (20th Anniversary Special Edition)plays a character so different than the man most people knew from the 1980's.  Then there is Jackie Cook daughter of Neptune Shark's icon Terrence Cook who eventually becomes Wallace's on again off again girlfriend.  Her role in Season Two is very minor, who only role really was to be a love interest for Wallace.The biggest guest star of the season is probably Charisma Carpenter better know to audiences as Cordelia Chase onAngel - Seasons 1-5 30-Disc DVD Set.  In the second season she plays Dick and Cassidy's gold digging yet very fine young stepmother Kendall Casablancas a character that Charisma says is like a sexier, more evil Cordelia think of Cordelia fromAngel - Season One (Slim Set)is a little more selfish and more evil.All and all Veronica Mars Season Two left me speechless.  But unlike Season One's finale Season Two's finale almost told the audience there will be a season three.  If you were a fan of season one, you will be a fan of season two."	5.0	Much like the first season, but better.	2008-12-23	0	0	0
