6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"The holidays become a blur.  We've all been accustomed to seeing Christmas music on display well before Halloween has come and gone.  This idea was given full reign in `It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,' with the late Charles M. Schultz's wonderful take on Halloween when Linus gets mixed up between Santa Claus and the famous, fictitious legend who delivers toys on Halloween night.  This is where Tim Burton's `The Nightmare Before Christmas' takes off, but from there all parallels stop, and flair takes the helm for this truly unique animated adventure.The story is uncomplicated enough.  Jack Skellington (Danny Elfman), an emaciated man who is charming in character and sinister in appearance, is the figure head of Halloweentown, and the key figure of the most anticipated holiday of the village.  November 1st as one might expect, is a let-down, and a down-cast Jack finds himself wandering through a forest all night long.At the end of his journey, he discovers the North Pole and all the inhabitants surrounding Christmas's festive figure, Santa Claus.  Noting that there is something different abound, he goes back to Halloween Town and brings all he sees back to the people.  Feeling inadequate to convey the warmth of the season, he plots with three mischievous children to kidnap Ole Saint Nick and have the secrets of gift giving unfold for his town.Embellishing the story are some offbeat characters.  Ragdoll Sally (Catherine O'Hara) is captive to the nasty Dr. Finkelstein (William Hickey) in a Rapunzel-like subplot.`The Nightmare Before Christmas' could have been a one note wonder, but what I like about it is the charm factor.  In the midst of a cute and macabre background (I'd never thought that would mix until seeing this film.), delightful songs and memorable characters fill the screen.  It doesn't exactly come off like Lucille Ball singing ""We Need a Little Christmas,"" but the sojourn from a dark world yearning to be lighter is worth taking indeed.A J.P.'s Pick 5 *'s =ExceptionalHappy Halloween! ;>)"	5.0	Cute and Macabre (?)	2008-10-31	4	4	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1RNLPUDOD5ZNG	A. Banaag	This is one of Burton's BEST! A classic X-Mas/Halloween flick anyone &amp; everyone will enjoy.This flick is about Jack, a skeleton/pumpkin king that lives in.. (DUH!) Halloween Town along with many other frightening Halloween characters.Every Halloween it's always the same to Jack. The Halloweeners in town gather for a celebration as done in the various years. This particular year, however, Jack stumbles across Holiday Doors, and learns about Christmas. Jack, so inspired by this new &amp; interesting place, decides to give Santa a brake for that year and turns Christmas Halloween style.With memorable characters and songs, you'll totally LOVE this movie!!!!!!!!	5.0	No Nightmare to me!	2003-12-12	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A26HBG3RKZVO2P	Alec Dublin	The Nightmare before Christmas is my favorite movie of all time. I previously had the DVD and decided to upgrade to the Blu Ray and am glad I did. The movies colors are more vibrant and most importantly the backgrounds are a deep black rather than the slightly grey hint seen in the Blu Ray. The sound is more vivid and the whole experience is enhanced by switching to Blu Ray.	5.0	Favorite Movie of All Time Just Got Better	2010-08-04	0	0	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1E2B66E85AFBZ	"Alecto Kurpiel ""Iris"""	This movie is a great classic for the gothic community. It's dark, funny, and doesn't take too much brain power to appreciate it. Being a Disney movie, of course it has a simple love story hidden within the chaos, but it isn't as sappy as the usual love story goes. It's actually quite refreshing.Overall The Nightmare Before Christmas is simply fun. It shows how one should appreciate the small things in life and how you should always be yourself.	4.0	Simple, but fun.	2004-10-11	3	2	1

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	ACAO2J1XCS4FL	Alexander Suraev	It's no secret that the majority of Europeans see American cultural import as something highly entertaining but not very complex and sophisticated. The plots are simplistic, the characters lacking individuality,etc. I am not talking here about the well-known masterpieces but the everyday  Hollywood produce make this opinion well-deserved. On the other hand  today's European cinema is often anemic and uninspired. Of course I  generalize but for the most part it's true.Living in Moscow I try to get  the best of both worlds and in The Nightmare Before Christmas I found  something that can be called flawless. It's very entertaining, the music is  the classic of the genre, the visuals are just unbelievable! It's complex,  it's fun, it's perfect in form and content. Frankly, you can hardly expect  all that from the American animation industry lately represented by  Anastasia, The Hercules and other sodomizations of the world history. So  the Nightmare's team did a great job of creating this surprisingly original  piece of art.The main idea are the perspectives of communication between  the worlds that are so much different.  What happens if one of them come  uninvited to visit the other with the best intentions and gifts designed to  please. The result is far from idyllic.What happens if the extraordinary  person is tired of his world and thinks that the real life is elsewhere. So  he travels abroad and finally finds the happiness at home.It's strange  that some of the reviewers consider the Haloween creatures too violent.  They are no more violent that Maurice Sendac's Wild Things or the monsters  our children like to invent when they exchage the self-made horror  stories.The portrayal of children of the Halloween Town is very accurate  - the little ones are unexhaustable, inventive and ready to do anything  just to see what comes out of it- just like my 7-year old son.So this  DVD is an ideal investment and do not regret.	5.0	It's flawless!	1999-12-22	16	15	1

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A38BE0W8TVC7J5	Amanda	This movie is beyond enchanting, delving into the realms of spellbinding.  I never thought that an animated film could be so stunning with its cinematography mixed with the music.  That's the amazing beauty of Tim Burton's world: it's filled with contrasts.  In particular is Sally (voiced by the Canadian goddess Catherine O'Hara) the ragdoll who externally is not the most beautiful thing with her stitchings and patched clothes, but internally she is pure and filled with love for Jack.  Even her singing (again Catherine) sounds like an innocent child, straight tone (no vibrato) and a flowing, velvet soprano.The world of Halloweentown is dark, but filled with beauty and rich melodies straining through (by the genius Danny Elfman).  The construction of the film is so perfect making Halloweentown filled with browns and blacks whereas Christmastown is bright and cheerful, joyful as we expect Christmas to be and the real world is somewhere in between.  All of it pulls together beautifully to create a timeless story and the most magnificently filmed ending with Sally and Jack in the snow.Just proves the genius of the film makers.	5.0	Spellbinding	2004-07-02	1	1	0

I simply adored it. I immediately fell in love with Tim Burton and his artistry. This is a beautiful movie for both children and adults. The animation is beautiful and the score is simply haunting. Danny Elfman was at his peak in composing the soundtrack for this enchanting fantasy, musical.

The song is the theme for EVERY Halloween of course....(but HEY?) And the movie is just 2 great! Besides BEETLEJUICE and Edward Scissorhands (Hey me, my guy and my friends/family dig the classics.) Plus this year I found The Revamped Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys video version, so YES they're are some fans of our movie out there. And I wanted to talk more about that vid so my review won't sound the same as last year's (even though I didn't make that review on Halloween.....it was more during the summer before they changed the system.....so if you read it cool! But This one's for the vid that goes with it!  BLADE and FLAME THROWER have teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red.....added with Leech Woman and Jester is one who's waiting for the next surprise! Six Shooter has the fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair line......and then we have the other cool Toulan Puppets As the Halloween town background characters and there's Corey Feldman of course as my FAVORITE Puppet Master; now for those of you readers who've noticed I've been writing about him a lot....there IS a pretty interesting story that goes with it that EVERYONE will hear about soon; but don't worry.....I haven't gone all Kathy Bates in Misery.......(I'm not THAT weird; but I can't tell you the rest of the story yet either.....Just think of the song lyrics.....Everybody's waiting for the next surprise!

Now that I have a child who is at a great age for this movie it was time to take the plunge.  I was going to my normal itunes account, but my wife redirected me to Amazon and I am glad she did.  This is perfect because you can stream it any time you want.  You also can load it onto one device and if you have an iPad and AppleTV then you can stream to the AppleTV through the iPad, basically giving you access to your content properly and legally through just about any means conceivable.  Also, you can't beat the price.  It's nice that Amazon doesn't try to push you to use their systems like Apple does and from a household that has an equal number of units that are either PC/Android or Apple the freedom to use your own content when and where you want is a breath of fresh air.	5.0	have always loved this movie, but never owned it.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AK0CENM3LUM28	Amazon Customer	"Nightmare Before Christmas / B001AIRUP4*Spoilers*I vaguely recall missing out on seeing this famous movie at the original release, largely due to the fact that my conservative parents were displeased with the Halloween-style material, particularly the starring talking skeleton, Jack the Pumpkin King. And when - years later - my fiance brought this lovely Blu-Ray home, I was puzzled: why were we watching a Christmas movie in October?Surprisingly enough, despite the title, ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" isn't really 'about' Christmas in the usual TV special tradition kind of way - and that's a good thing. The arching story is that the king of the Halloween world is very, very good at what he does, but very, very bored and tired of life, his job, and his friends. When he accidentally stumbles into the Christmas world, he is delighted by the different sights, colors, and sounds - and rushes back to tell the Halloween residents of his discover. Though they are less enthused than he, Jack becomes increasingly obsessed with finding a new holiday outlet for himself and finally decides that this year's Christmas will be handled by the Halloween world residents!This interesting ""bored with life"" plot is carefully overlaid with truly beautiful music and lyrics - ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a lovely musical, even judged by today's standards, this is music for all ages, not just little children. And, indeed, I can't imagine why children of all ages wouldn't enjoy ""Nightmare"" - despite the title, there is very little here which is scary or frightening (even the Boogie Man is silly to the point of hilarity), and I suspect that the titular ""nightmare"" is one of Jack's own devising - in learning his limits and coming to love what he's best at and appreciate those around him.As for the Blu-Ray transfer, this movie is absolutely lovely. Since it's animated, you're not going to see every pore on each actor's face, but the detail on the animated characters is surprisingly complex on such an old movie. I'll put it this way - I often can't even tell if a movie is blu-ray or not, but with ""Nightmare"" there was no doubt.~ Ana Mardoll"	5.0	Lovely at any time of the year	2009-10-06	4	3	1

Sadly, when we moved a few years ago, we apparently lost the physical copy. My brother had never seen the movie before, so we purchased it Prime out of convenience, and he absolutely loved it.This is a family friendly movie, engaging for both youngsters and adults alike. Some of it would be a bit weird/spooky for younger kids, but the claymation is mesmerising. My brother is functionally 7 or 8 (he has Down Syndrome), and there were a few moments he looked at me pretty wide-eyed, but he wanted to watch it again and again. We ended up buying a physical copy for him, and he is currently learning all of the songs to drive me nuts.	5.0	A classic, able to be watched over and over and over....	2012-12-31	0	0	0

There's simply no other way to describe it.  The story, the music and the animation combine to present probably the most original and unique Christmas tale since the original animated HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS.The movie nicely showcases the vocal talents of Chris Sarandon (THE PRINCESS BRIDE), Catherine O'Hara (HOME ALONE I and II) and, of course Danny Elfman.  Elfman's score for the movie is also masterful.THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS is a terrific tie that connects the fall seasons, from Halloween to Christmas and promises to be a holiday standard for decades to come. You will also enjoy the many special features, including FRANKENWEENIE and VINCENT, two Tim Burton shorts, that are included on this DVD.THE HORSEMAN	5.0	THE MOST ORIGINAL CHRISTMAS TALE SINCE THE GRINCH!	2004-12-27	2	1	1

Since it's an older movie and was made in claymation I thought you'd see a lot of gritty details and it would lose some of it's magic. However, it was quite the opposite - Tim Burton and the artists for this movie put a lot of effort into making every detail impeccable and it shows.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1YC6KVMGCWYJE	"Amazon Customer ""seeker of truth"""	I admit that i have always been an odd kind of person. So when i first heard about Nightmare Before Christmas i just had to see it...what i had not expected was to see so many others eager to see it. I grew apprehensive, thinking perhaps i had been tricked by the title, and was about to see the usual sickly sweet holiday shlock usually served up for the season. As it turned out, both I and the crowd were in for a rare treat. The story is very much at it's core the sentimental story of the 'spirit of christmas', but it has never been told in quite this way before. the claymation characters were familiar to us that remember frosty and company, but we never envisioned claymated 'clowns with tear-away faces' singing about thier favorite holiday.Which brings me to the songs. I can not praise Danny Elfman enough for the sheer magic he brought to this film. I am a professed fan of musicals both new and old (told you i was odd) but it is rare in the extreme for the music of a movie, or even a musical play, to so fully capture the mood, emotions, and playful flavor of what is at heart a childrens' story. Elfman not only does this, but also manages to make the songs enjoyable and even memorable for adults too.This combined with a witty and bubbly brand of humor, that is only partially directed to the kids, comes together to create a film worthy of any DVD collection.	5.0	Delightfully Different	2006-02-14	3	1	2

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1D6DFC3AGV3JZ	Andrew Parodi	Every time October rolls around, I have to watch THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. Halloween is my favorite holiday, and yet, since I'm an adult, I can't trick-or-treat anymore, but I *can* watch THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.This is a movie unlike anything you have ever seen before: it is a stop-action, musical comedy about the leader of &quot;Halloweentown&quot; - Jack Skellington - growing tired of his job and deciding he might give Christmas a try. But the plot, in my opinion, is really secondary to the off-beat, even bizarre and yet endearing, songs that are sung by this original cast of characters. These characters are so original and so interesting that you feel as though you have always known them. And the surprise to the film is that, in many ways, it is actually a love story between Jack and his admirer, Sally. &quot;But will we ever / end up together?&quot; sings Sally.I think that people of all ages would enjoy this movie, except that some of it may be too scary for the very young child (four and under). For me, however, it wouldn't be Halloween without THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS!	5.0	A Halloween tradition!	2002-09-28	10	9	1

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A23XW45XJXWAB9	AnimatedAdventures.com	"This is why DVD was invented...to give viewers a closer look at the film and how it was made. This DVD has everything a TNBC fan and aspiring animator could dream of, from character development sketches to pre-production animation tests. The film-to-storyboard comparison alone is worth it even if it is only for a small section of the film. It is a friendly reminder of how much planning goes into making an animated film, before any frames are even recorded. Just a script and lots and lots of drawings. The other bonus materials highlight the ""tweaking"" that occured during production, really bringing you in to the artists' decision-making process. Fun fact: Jack Skellington's legs are so thin that early animation tests revealed ""strobing"" problems in the film. The deleted scenes are fascinating, and reveal unknown plot twists (spoiler alert: Oogie Boogie = the evil scientist in disguise). The inclusion of Tim Burton's early short films ""Vincent"" and ""Frankenweenie"" is the icing on the cake, and its clear upon seeing them that Mr. Burton had been nurturing the character and style of ""Nighmare"" long before it was made (look for Jack and Sally look-alikes in ""Vincent""'s nightmare sequence) . Besides all these wonderful bonus features, the movie is a classic must-see."	5.0	"Nightmare is a ""Dream"" of a DVD"	2005-01-29	1	1	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1QWNBPCNXF3U9	Anniqa Bucheger	"It's ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" of course.  It was the movie that made the record of the first stop motion animated film.  The story is of a character who has never heard of Christmas before and somehow ""discovers"" it. I think it is always worth view, unless your one of those... individuals who doesn't appreciate Tim Burton's ""dark humor.""  The story is of Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, but lately, he's pretty much grown tired of the same old tricks and treats, deep in lamentation. (Hence the name of the song, ""Jack's Lament."")  One night, while he's wandering around in a forest, head filled with his thoughts of misery and woe, he finds a clearing where every tree is decorated with some holiday symbol.  They all seem to interest him, but what fascinates Jack the most is none other than the Christmas tree.  Danny Elfman, who provides Jack's gorgeous singing voice, is a master with ""Nightmare's"" music and songs.  Who wouldn't mind going out on Halloween night, singing ""This is Halloween"" at the top of their lungs?  (That's what my friends and I did last Halloween.)  Anyway, you have ten songs to choose from.  The cast of characters is awesome too.  Sally (Catherine O'Hara) is sweet and sensitive and is always willing to help Jack, even it means literally risking an arm and a leg.  Lock, Shock, and Barrel (Paul Rubeuns, Catherine O'Hara, and Danny Elfman) help make up ""Nightmare's"" interesting plot.  Without this terrible threesome, Santa Claus (Ed Ivory) would have no place in the story.  Now, every movie needs a villain, and who would be better than the notorious Oogie Boogie (Ken Page)?  Overall, I think this movie deserves all five stars.  One for animation, one for music, one for charcters, one for the story, and one for everone who pitched in and worked on this movie for three years."	5.0	What's this?

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB	"ANT ""azraelart"""	Though he did not direct, this is Tim Burton's movie.  And Danny Elfman's as well.  It is based on the stories and characters of Burton, and it truly comes alive through Elfman's music.It is a dark and twisted tale of a world where every day is Halloween, a world where every holiday has its own domain.  Well, what would happen if the dark and scary Halloween world took over and ran the cheerful and bright Christmas world?  Tim Burton was born to tell this story.  We follow Jack Skellington, his ghost dog Zero, the rag doll Sally, and a number of other largely humorous and colorful supporting characters on a wild ride of seasonal dysfunction.The special edition DVD also comes with some great bonus features, including deleted scenes (3 storyboard, 4 animated), trailers and posters, plus and possibly the best, two early Burton shorts, &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; and &quot;Vincent&quot; (the latter being in my opinion the best short Burton has ever made).  It's great for kids (though I wouldn't recommend maybe for toddlers) and adults alike.  The humor is tame enough, yet twisted in its own right.  This is a must have to any Burton fan's collection and also a necessary piece to add to a claymation/puppetry/animation library.  Great viewing for both holidays!And trust me, you'll want to buy the special edition for the extras.  If only ALL special edition DVDs were this good.	5.0	Burton and Elfman's finest, a masterpiece	2004-03-15	1	1	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3F2VVIQIY6U64	Armando N. Roman	"When The Nightmare Before Christmas came out on blu-ray a few years ago, it had a beautiful transfer, great audio and a good amount of special features. It also came with a digital copy, but no dvd. Now it's being re-released in a huge combo pack: the blu-ray, 3D blu-ray, dvd AND digital copy along with a much better looking box. The blu-ray and dvd will essentially be the same as the last release, but with a little more in the extras department. Here's what they're including:-A Special Introduction by Tim Burton-What's This? Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour: Viewers choose the way they want to tour Disneyland's Holiday Haunted Mansion.-Frankenweenie short film: A un-cut version of the ""Frankenweenie"" short with introduction by Tim Burton.-Vincent Short Film-Tim Burton's original NBC poem, as performed by legendary actor Christopher Lee.-Commentary by producer and writer Tim Burton, director Henry Selick and composer Danny Elfman.-The Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas-The Worlds of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas (the creation of the film's richly imagined dreamscapes, including Halloween Town, Christmas Town and the Real World)-Deleted scenes-Storyboard to film comparison-Original theatrical trailers and postersI'm usually against reviewing something before it comes out, but given that I already have the blu-ray and digital copy, and the newest dvd release was pretty much the blu-ray but less pretty, it's safe to say that this set will be worth the money. I just hope that Disney Movie Rewards offers some kind of coupon for those who already own either the dvd or blu-ray and want to upgrade, like they usually do with other re-releases. Even if you don't care for 3D, this is a really good deal if you missed out on buying NBC the first time....especially since the digital copy code in the last release expired a while ago."	5.0	Well well well...what have we here?

Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list"""	I loved this movie, from the first time I saw it, and the DVD has a good amount of extras in it which fans will appreciate.This movie is one of the most amazing, wierd, inspired movies I have seen. It is animated, and is about what would happened if the people of Halloween land stole Christmas. Jack O Lantern is depressed, Halloween has just passed and it is the same old same old - he is looking for something but just doesn't know what. He strays into Christmasland and is suddenly reviatlised.Returning to Halloweenland he tries to explain just what Christmas is, the joy the presents - but the residents don't quite grasp the happiness and joy - they see the 'stalkings' instead of stockings and so on. So Jack gives up explaining it to them and instead allows them to do Christmas as they see fit . They make presents - snakes which swallow family pets - jack in the boxes which attack, and other horrible things.The songs are amazing, I love the music - even my two small children do and I am always surprised when my 4 year old requests to watch this. I would actually have thought they should be quite frightened of it at that age, maybe the scary bits are too unreal.Nice romance underlying it and the whole thing is filmed in the usual Burton-esque almost monochrome darkness world.There are great extras available, including scenes which were cut or shortened from the original and interviews with Burton.	5.0	One of the craziest movies I've ever seen, lotsof nice extras	2005-12-29	18	16	2

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"I'm sure most of my friends are surprised that I've never seen this movie before, but you must remember that I've only owned a DVD player for about three and a half years [written in 2009], and almost never went to movies in theaters before that. I didn't know anything about Tim Burton until I discovered Johnny Depp, and I thought Depp was going to be the voice of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King. But it's OK that he's not: it's still a very fun movie.The basic premise is that all the holidays come from their own towns, accessible through hollow trees that stand in a ring with symbols of the holidays involved on each one. One has a profile of a turkey, one a red heart, one a painted egg, another a pumpkin, and one a decorated tree. I think there were others, but I don't remember exactly. The narrator takes us through the pumpkin shaped door into the world of Halloween Town, which is supposed to be very scary and spooky, but is mostly funny, and perhaps would be gross if they weren't animations. The Mayor is a roly-poly character with two faces, one grinning and one menacing, who wears a badge saying ""Mayor"" and who says, ""I'm only an elected official; I can't make decisions by myself."" The real hero is Jack, the Pumpkin King. He's every bit as skinny as a skeleton except that he wears a black pin-striped suit.But Jack is bored of the same old thing every year, and goes wandering off to bemoan his fate, finally discovering the ring of trees with the doors to other holidays. He goes into the one for Christmas and is overwhelmed. It's wonderful! All bright lights and happy people, and he wants it for his own.Then there is Sally, Dr. Finkelstein's creation, a sweet blue girl who is his slave. She's all stitches, and can break off an arm or a leg as necessary, sewing it back when there's time. She's in love with Jack, and Finkelstein keeps her from him except for when she puts a sleeping potion in his food so she can get away.So when Jack comes back to Halloween Town to get everyone hyped up to make Christmas this year, he asks Sally to make a Santa Claus costume for him. He's misunderstood, and thinks it is Sandy Claws who is in charge of Christmas, and something frightening instead of beloved. When the Boogie's boys go and capture Santa Claus for him, he looks at him and declares, ""Why you have hands! Where are your claws?""No, I'm not going to spoil it. Much of the fun is the music and the visual effects of the various characters in Halloween Town, and the gifts and toys they make for Christmas. But there is a plot (all puns intended), and the basic question is how can Halloween and Christmas get back to their proper spheres?Anyone over the age of 5 or 6 will probably love this one, right up to 95 or 96."	4.0	Animation as Only Tim Burton Can Do It	2012-05-13	0	0	0

Wilkins ""star gazer"""	Looking at a store shelf and seeing both Halloween Decorations and Christmas decorations together, I believe, may have been the premise for this wonderfully offbeat holiday movie. Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King and the ruler of Halloweentown where all the Halloween nightmare figures live, work and plan for every Halloween since the beginning, but Jack is slowly beginning to feel tired of the same yearly routine and is starting to wonder if there isn't something more. As he is pondering these thoughts, he does encounter something new in a stretch of forest just outside of HalloweenTown. There in a grove is a circle of trees where each holds a doorway, and each doorway is marked differently. One, however, intrigues him more than the rest and he opens it--and is pulled into a completely different world, so unlike his own.It is then he discovers that there are other holidays-and towns like his that celebrates their own days and he has entered ChristmasTown.So enthralled and delighted with his discovery he takes back all that he can find to share this news with the rest of HalloweenTown and ponders his discovery further, especially how to share this holiday. Instead, he decides to take it over and has Santa Claus Kidnapped as he and HalloweenTown prepare for Christmas. The three henchmen who kidnap Santa However, decide to take Santa to Oogie Boogie, who is delighted with the prospect of throwing a wrench in Jack's plans, while Jack proceeds to carry out his plans of delivering toys and treats for Christmas, but with a decidely different twist on things which is not appreciated by the population he visits, prompting an attack on him by the military. Sally, a lovely young creation of Dr. Finklestein, has only Jack's best interests at heart and when her warnings fall on deaf ears tries to save Santa herself, only to be captured by Oogie to join Santa in his own impending demise.Only Jack can save them both--if he can get back in time. This is quite a fascinating romp and there are wonderful catchy tunes and while the figures in HalloweenTown are somewhat nightmarish looking,they are quite likeable in their own quirky way, and seeing Jack play Santa Claus is definitely worth a laugh. Oogie Boogie though is actually quite scary, but has a way with a song which is also quite memorable. While this might scare the toddler set, others would find it fun. It is quite a quirky treat for either Halloween-or Christmas.	5.0	A great romp between Holidays.....	2013-07-25	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3IPUSBKTJWB90	Bobbie Joe	By watching this movie right away you will think Tim Burton is a genious. I love the anamation and the darkness to it. Even the singing is incridable!The film starts off in the land of Halloween with Jack, The Pumpkin King. After many years of of celebrating Halloween Jack becomes bored, sad, and depressed. While everyone is celebrating another great halloween, Jack takes a walk into the Forest and finds a mysterious place he has never been before.  A circle of trees each with a door and on those doors a picture representing a holliday.  He looked at each one and then stopped when he saw a Christmas tree painted on one of the doors. He opens it and finds himself in Christmas town. He was looking at everything with wonder, the snow, the elves, presents, and even Santa Clause. Later he comes back to Halloween Town to tell everyone about what he saw. But it was hard to describe.  After many expirements with Christmas he decides he wants to kidnapp Santa clause and become Santa himself. He changes his image and brings Christmas to Halloween.This is a great film. And I nice way to put a Chrismasy twist on Halloween. I highly recommend it.	4.0	This is Halloween, This is Halloween	2010-01-17	0	0	0

Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle"""	If you are one of those fortunate people who never heard anything about this movie I'm about to do you a favor. I'm not going to describe it. I want you to experience this movie for yourself. I first saw &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; in theaters during October of 1993. I began watching this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it. In fact, I made an effort not to learn anything about it. This was an advantage, because what I saw and heard was unlike anything I had ever seen before.The only thing I will say about this film is the music. It's by Danny Elfman--Tim Burton's film composer and the former lead singer of Oingo Boingo. I've been a Danny Elfman fan for years. He has done some fantastic songs and motion picture scores. For &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; he also created and performed several songs. It was a real joy to hear Danny Elfman sing again.Trust me on this one. This film is a real treat for the eyes, and a visually imaginative piece of work.	5.0	An astonishing film for the eyes	2001-08-23	1	1	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A173AIKWVE0T0I	"""bradlington"""	I First Saw this film when I was eight years old in a ratherlarge cinema. The atmosphere was great. They even had a giant hangingJack Skellington from the ceiling. I remember having the feeling thatthe film was very funny, and bing young and Naive, i thought Santastill existed. The Music was fabulous and clever.  Now, the christmasafter that i bought the video but never fully understood it. Sevenyears later i decided to watch it again, as Tim Burton is now myfavourite director. His films all have a twisted sense of humour witha rather horrific undertone. I am now 14 and appreciate the film forall it's worth. The animation is stunning and in it's time must havebeen top of the line. The Music which rightfully won an Oscar is stillas powerful and twisted as ever. And the humour is razor sharp with avery satrical edge....The film is rather disturbing for youngchildren. My Cousin still won't watch it, and I think it might destroymany child's view of Christmas, but I still think that every familyshould Own a copy.  I Can't wait to see what Henry Sellick can do withMonkeybone and this film reinforces my view that Tim Burton shouldhave been the one to remake &quot;How the Grinch StoleChristmas!&quot;!	5.0	Sick, Twisted, Disturbing and Brilliant!	2000-12-24	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3PXHENWX4ODCZ	"bridget. ""unexplained robot"""	"The Nightmare Before Christmas is nearly 11 years old. Eleven years! When I realized that fact,my jaw dropped so hard and so fast that I put a nice dent in my hardwood floors. I assume this Special Edition DVD was released as a 10th Anniversary edition, but I can't recall ever hearing anything of the sort.The Nightmare Before Christmas follows the story of Jack Skellington, the King of Halloween. Jack has grown tired of the Halloween routine, year after year, and wishes for something new. His wish is granted as he finds his way to Christmas Town. Jack is instantly captivated by Christmas and embarks on a journey to do it himself, complete with ""Sandy Claws"" costume.Our heroine, Sally, isa animated ragdoll that was created by the cynical and jealous Professor Farnsworth. Sally is desperately in love with Jack but is convinced that they will never be together. One night she sees a vision that Jack's Christmas will be a disaster and tries to stop him, to no avail.The star of this movie are none of the characters; the star is the incredible stop-motion animation thathasn't aged a day of it's 11 years. You can watch the film as probably intended, as a whimsical fantasy and love story and enjoy it thoroughly. You can also watch it as an amazing work of art and study the handicraft and work that went in to each of the scenes (24 separate posed frames for each single second of film).The extras included on this edition of the DVD are rather pleasing. There is one ""Making Of"" documentary that is nearly 30 minutes long, dozens of character and set designs, amusing test shots of early character models and the normal trailers that you get with any disc. The real bonusis the inclusion Tim Burton's early films ""Vincent"" and ""Frankenweenie"". ""Vincent"" is a very short poetic tale about a boy who believes he is Vincent Price (being narrated by the man himself is icing on the cake). This is done in the stop-motion animation style of Nightmare. The second film, ""Frankenweenie"" is over 30 minutes of live action. It stars Daniel Stern and Barrett Oliver (Bastian from The Neverending Story) as his son who brings his dead dog back to life after seeing an experiment in his Biology class. These two short films are as entertaining and funny as Nightmare itself.In short, this DVD edition of The Nightmare Before Christmas is well worth your money. Even if you've never seen the film. Even if you already own the VHS. Even if you've seen it 100 times. (...)"	5.0	A Classic in every sense.	2004-05-19	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2E3F04ZK7FG66	calvinnme	"The movie opens with Jack Skellington, AKA the Pumpkin King, facing an identity crisis of sorts. Halloween has just ended in his hometown of Halloween Town, and he has been receiving kudos from everyone in town for making this year's Halloween the scariest ever. But Jack is seeking purpose in his life, and scaring people to death once a year just isn't doing it for him anymore. He takes a walk in the woods and he discovers a group of trees each with doors and different symbols on each door. He opens the door with the tree symbol on it, and finds himself in Christmas Town. While there, he is fascinated by the contrast of Christmas Town with his own world. Jack returns home, along with a sampling of trinkets from Christmas Town, to contemplate the meaning of what he has found there. Ultimately he decides that this year, Halloween Town is going to take charge of Christmas. Jack has also decided that he will replace ""Sandy Claws"" on his yearly sleigh ride, delivering presents to all of the children of the world. All of the citizens of Halloween Town are enthused by the idea except Sally, a creation of Halloween Town's mad scientist, who coincidentally is also looking for something new in her life. She alone sees the danger of Halloween Town hijacking the Christmas holiday.While the Grinch tried to destroy Christmas and came away with a true understanding of the meaning of the holiday, Jack Skellington, with the best of intentions, ruins Christmas but never figures out where he went wrong. In preparation for the big event, he enlists the townspeople to help make toys, and they just can't get the hang of making or doing anything that is not designed to terrify. In fact, when Jack makes his Christmas ride and the town hears on the radio of the terror Jack is causing, they actually see this as a sign of success. To them, horror equals happiness.Like most good films designed for all age groups, the movie is actually weaving a tale on two levels. The story itself is very straightforward so that children can easily follow it. On a second level, there is deft humor and one-liners that are obviously aimed at adults, such as the mayor's plea to Jack -""I'm only an elected official here!  I can't make decisions!"" Or when the scientist who created Sally gets tired of her running away and builds a new creation to replace her. This one turns out to be just a female version of the mad scientist himself to which he has endowed half of his own brain. His conclusion is ""You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally. We'll have conversations worth having.""Besides being clever and funny, this film is visually intriguing. All of the figures move smoothly and naturally, and the attention to detail is exquisite. The process of making this film required what was then (pre-1993) state-of-the-art computer-controlled camera movement for this feature film's stop-motion animation. Puppets built of a foam latex material covering intricate metal armatures were manipulated frame-by-frame on real miniature sets. The painstaking process took nearly three years to complete, with dozens of animators and crew members averaging only 60 seconds of film per week, because each different pose or position equaled only a 24th of a second of film time.You'll see quite a bit of similarity between the style of art design here and that done in some of Tim Burton's other films, such as ""Beetlejuice"". You'll also probably recognize Danny Elfman's style of score that has come to decorate so many of Burton's other films. I highly recommend this film as great entertainment for the whole family."	5.0	Great movie artfully combines the fun of two holidays	2006-02-12	2	1	1

The characters are gorgeously created with plastacine and movie with qualities. My favourite character is Jack Skellington. Whom wants to change his same old, boring routine of being King of the Pumpkin Patch and ruler of Halloween to something new, and stumbles upon Christmas Town. Jack soon deciedes, in his good of heart, to rule over this holiday as well and brings it home to his ghoulish friends, which has horrid consequences. It is a wonderful movie and everyone I shown it too loves it as well. Though me and alot of my friend, hate Sally, we all know Jack has such better taste.

My strange babysitter showed it to me when I was younger and I liked it but I really didn't get it. Then I discovered Edward Scissorhands and became interested in Tim Burton. So, I pulled out The Nightmare before Christmas from the Blockbuster's shelf, came home, and watched it. And I loved it- the strange music, the lyrics, the plot, and especially the characters. All of the characters are very real-strange for a fantasy movie. People of any age can watch this movie.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2EUG9W2IAVCT	C. Eberlein	This is one of the top movies in my all time favorites list and for good reason.  It came out two years before I even reached age 10 but I remember seeing and it being fascinated in a chilled sense.  The Nightmare Before Christmas is a humorous (and somewhat dark) take on the classic Christmas tale--eventually becoming a classic itself.  The first movie to be made in stop motion features memorable characters, brilliant music and great talent.  Parents concerned if The Nightmare Before Christmas is too dark for some of their children should put those feelings to rest; it's a movie and an entertaining one at that.  Like most adventure-influenced children's movies this has its good characters and scary ones.  But it's still fun and shouldn't freak one's kids out at all.  Overall The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those films that is both fun and brilliant.  It's classic!	5.0	A classic movie if there ever was one	2006-11-13	2	2	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2CVP31XTYSZFE	"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom"""	"Of all the American movie directors practicing their craft today - either with live action or animation, Tim Burton is hands down the most distinctive in a visual sense. Knowing nothing else of plot, title or characters, I think any observer could unerringly identify a collection of stills from his movies jumbled in with hundreds of others.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is the ultimate Tim Burton movie - a witty, complicated feast for the eyes - and done in that most complicated and painstaking way imaginable, through stop-motion photography. The story is as simple as a child's picture book, and the moral of it equally straight forward; best to be yourself than to be something you are not. Jack Skellington, the doyen of Halloween town, is bored with it all, and tries out being Santa Claus, with comically disastrous results. Plot in a nutshell, but ornamented with such baroque and deliciously dark detail!This set, which includes a completely remastered version of the movie and a disc of extra features, plus a digital version for your PC, comes in an ornate case about the size of a single VHS. This negates some of the space-saving advantage of a DVD library, but it is a very attractive cover at that. The bonus features include the usual `making' of feature, which goes into painstaking detail over how the character puppets were created and jointed, placed into the set and photographed one tiny motion at a time. There is a close look at  the sets - Halloween Town, Christmas Town and `the real world', a collection of omitted scenes, and a comparison of the storyboard version to the completed release. There are two standouts in the extras. The first is a short animated film by Tim Burton of his own poem ""Vincent"" -about a little boy equally obsessed with Edgar Allen Poe and being Vincent Price, which is narrated by Vincent Price himself. The second is a black and white version of the Frankenstein story; Frankenweenie, in which a boy reanimates his beloved dog. Both shorts can be spotted as Tim Burton movies from a mile away, especially in ""Frankenweenie's"" cemetery scene."	5.0	A Distinctive Visual Sense	2009-05-14	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AQIYPA5S073XN	Chad Gould	I've always been a fan of Tim Burton movies. Tim Burton has a remarkably twisted imagination that will appeal to older children and adults alike. The DVD never looked better, the transfer is excellent. The 5.1 effects are  well done - not as explosive as an action film, but for a cartoon its  impressive. Elfman's score is appropriate: very catchy tunes, on the pop  order and not too memomrable, but fitting in the movie's context very well.  Very typical for the Elfman / Burton combination. The stop-motion is  fantastic.The DVD looses a star for being bare-bones. Great transfer,  but the extras are terrible. Especially since the laserdisc transfer had a  lot more going for it (commentary, etc.)(Regarding the comments that it  was too violent: a Tim Burton film is not a happy-go-lucky film for 4 year  olds ala Disney. To me, it has the best qualities of a twisted kids' story,  which is usually geared more towards 10 to 15 year olds. As an example,  look at the poetry of Shel Silverstein, or animation classics such as  Looney Tunes. They have a similar appeal, even cross-section appeal to  adults. Tim Burton's films have always been like that.)	4.0	Great transfer, lousy extras	1999-10-10	6	3	3

I highly recommend this movie for any fan of animation.  The reason I say that this film is Rather Un-Tim Burton is  because of the lack of gore.  But for younger viewers that's a good thing,  I guess.  This film may scare really little kids, cause a lot of the  characters are, well, dead, to put it frankly.

From the commercial I thought there might be some cgi goodies added or the new 3d cgi movie that was shown in theatres two halloweens or so ago.

To put it in terms: this runs in 24 frames so the character is posed 24 times for just one second of film and this film is roughly 70-90 minutes but the results look amazing. At times, you gotta ask yourself whether this was computer animated.The story is that Jack Skellington, ""the Pumpkin King"" of Halloween Town has just finished a successful Halloween but he's finding it repetitive and redundant so he takes a long walk and finds trees with holiday symbols and he gets amazed by the one with a christmas tree but gets sucked into that world and literally he's floored by how amazing it is and rather than show people the tree, he figures he'll make christmas himself, ignoring a girl who loves Jack named Sally, who has a vision that his christmas will go down in flames.These songs are just too damn catchy for their own good. Written and largely sung by Danny Elfman who supplies Jack's singing voice. And the voices are excellent and really compliment their characters, especially Jack's, he's got a cool voice.As I write this, it's 10/31/02 so it's Halloween so whether you're having a Halloween party or just want a good movie to watch, pop this in."	5.0	Perfect Halloween movie	2002-10-31	0	0	0

I've seen this movie so many times, but seeing it with such beautiful clarity, it feels like I'm seeing it for the first time.  I was watching the movie and a friend came over; the first thing she said when she walked through the door was ""Oh my God!  That looks amazing!""

The result is a stop-motion animated musical that's become a cult classic for the whole family.Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. He's altogether fearsome and empathetic, monstrous and charming, and basically a good guy (even if a little over ambitious). But he's become disenchanted with his routine life. Every year he leads the other creepy citizens of his town in a Halloween scare fest, but what's there to do the other 364 days of the year? Jack finds out when he and his ghost-dog, Zero accidentally come across a forest where upon each tree there's a door representing every holiday. Jack stumbles through one of the doors and finds himself in Christmas Town. After learning a bit about Christmas, Jack becomes obsessed with replicating it in his own delightfully twisted way. He enlists the help of Lock, Shock and Barrel, the town's local juvenile gang, to kidnap Santa Claus so that Jack can take over Christmas for that year. But all goes awry when the sinister Oogie Boogie plots against Jack. He plans to take control of Halloween Town while Jack is out playing ""Sandy Claws"". Meanwhile in our world Jack's presents turn out to be disastrous, mainly because they consist of toys like dead ducks on strings, disembodied heads and demonic stuffed animals. Soon the military is called in to shoot down Jack's sleigh along with his skeletal reindeer. Can Jack's friends save him in time? His greatest allies include a vampire trio, the literally two-faced Mayor, and Sally, a reanimated corpse who's fallen desperately in love with Jack.It's hard to believe that this year marks the 15th anniversary of the perennial holiday favorite. It's also interesting to note that many of Tim Burton's fans consider this to be his best film, which is ironic because he didn't actually direct it. Henry Selick is the director, though Burton's signature style is all over this film. It looks like Edward Gorey'sThe Gashlycrumb Tiniesbook meets an Edvard Munch painting. The humor is reminiscent ofThe Munsters,The Addams Family,Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, and Burton's ownEdward Scissorhands. The film even reminds me ofThe Wizard of Oz. It has important moral messages about not judging people on their appearance, accepting your own individuality and the true meaning of Christmas (generosity, sacrifice and unconditional love).The new 2-disc edition is loaded with special features including:an audio commentary track, a digital copy of the film, the short film Vincent, the short film Frankenweenie, Christopher Lee's recital of Tim Burton's poem which inspired the film, and numerous documentaries and featurettes about the making of the film.I also recommend the superbTim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmassoundtrack which features the original voice cast performing all of your favorite songs as well as new narration by Patrick Stewart. Also included is a second disc that contains contemporary artists performing covers of their favorite Nightmare Before Christmas songs. It's the only album released under the Disney banner to feature Marilyn Manson and songs about kidnapping and torturing Santa Claus, which alone makes this a must-have."	5.0	Halloween Meets Christmas	2008-06-18	2	2	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A21B2TJBWCSK1R	Cubist	"So, if you already own the previousThe Nightmare Before Christmas (Special Edition)is it worth double dipping for this new version and what is new? The good news is that with the exception of a DTS soundtrack and director Henry Selick's solo commentary track, everything from the previous edition has been included in this one.Disc one includes a new audio commentary by producer Tim Burton, director Henry Selick, and music designer Danny Elfman. They were recorded separately and then edited together. Burton talks about the classic animated holiday TV specials that made a huge impression on him. Elfman claims that this is his favourite collaboration with Burton and talks about how he got involved. There is a significant amount of overlap from the numerous featurettes included on this set.A new extra is ""What's This? Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour,"" which takes you through a haunted mansion ride based on the film. The attention to detail and decor is fantastic, done in Gothic fashion. You can also take the tour with a trivia subtitle track imparting all kinds of factoids. Also included is a featurette examining how they added the Nightmare Before Christmas style to the classic Haunted Mansion design.Also new is ""Tim Burton's Original Poem,"" narrated by none other than veteran genre actor Christopher Lee. This provided the original inspiration for the film. Lee's great voice narrates over evocative concept art.""The Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"" takes us through various stages of the production, including the music, storyboards, art direction, and animation. It provides a detailed look at all of the work that went into creating the film and the challenges of stop motion animation.The second disc starts off with ""Frankenweenie,"" a short film Burton directed in 1984. He offers a new introduction and mentions that work has begun on a feature-length stop motion animated film. Shot in gorgeous black and white, it's about a young boy named Vincent (Barret Oliver) who decides to resurrect his dead dog Sparky a la Dr. Frankenstein. Shelley Duvall and Daniel Stern play his very Leave It To Beaver-esque parents.""Vincent"" is an animated short film that Burton made early in his career about a young boy who idolizes Vincent Price, who, incidentally, narrates the story. It has a wonderful, Expressionistic look reminiscent of early silent horror films.Also included are three deleted storyboards and four animated sequences introduced by Selick. They feature sequences that didn't make the final cut, some were never animated. Selick explains that they were cut for reasons of time and pacing.""The World's of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"" explores the characters that inhabit Christmas Town, Halloween Town, and the Real World with all sorts of character designs, animation tests and concept art. It allows you to see the various incarnations of these beloved characters.""Storyboards-to-Film Comparison"" takes a look at a scene from the film and allows you to watch it simultaneously with the corresponding storyboards.Finally, there are ""Posters and Trailers,"" a collection of poster art, a teaser trailer and a theatrical trailer.Bottom line: if you own the previous Special Edition, it's not really worth the double dip unless you really a devoted fan of this film. If this is your first time purchasing this film on DVD, then get Collector's Edition which has everything you could possibly want."	4.0	Special Edition vs. Collector's Edition	2008-08-26	14	12	2

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3I7CRNHGZVWXP	Daisy Ghostly	What a major disappointment for all true stop-motion animation fans. I actually feel sorry for those who unknowingly call this a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, or a &quot;true classic&quot;; they must be pretty desperate. -But it's no wonder, really. If you've grown up with mostly cartoons and Disney movies, something &quot;different&quot; like this must seem like a revelation. -Come on, have you forgotten Ray Harryhausen or George Pal and his Puppetoons ?. Or people like the Quay Brothers, Jiri Trnka, Karel Zeman, Jan Svankmejer, etc., etc., etc. -They're the true masters; able to be innovative, atmospheric and scary. &quot;T.N.B.C.&quot; lack all these important ingredients. But the biggest disappointment of all is the animation itself. The movie may look slick, perfect and sophisticated (and I'm sure they spent a million hours on it), but it's too elaborate for its own good. I know stop-motion is all about detail, but if you spend too much time making the movements of the puppets quick and realistic you lose that  special kind of magic so essential to this wonderful art-form. In my opinion stop-motion is supposed to be rather slow and jerky looking - that's the very charm of it, for Christ sake !. Not necessarily dark and quirky, but it's at its otherworldly best when the execution of it is kept simple and primitive. Check out some old classic fairytales Czech-style for much more effective examples. I really don't know why they bothered, Burton &amp; Co. -They might as well have used computers, because CGI is almost what it feels (and looks) like to me. Stop-motion is after all an oldfashioned kind of animation, and just about the only place left where ones fantasy can truly flourish and your patience (brain, really) is challenged. Unlike CGI, it forces you to use you imagination still, and not disconnect it. Concentration, please !.	1.0	A big disappointment.	2000-03-11	146	6	140
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3U0RFW6AYHNND	Dana Geremonte	In this movie, there are is a town for each holiday, and the denizens of each town spend all year getting ready for the day when they go out into the world and celebrate their holiday along with the people of the real world.  This movie focuses on the antics of Jack Skellington, the ruler of Halloweentown, a.k.a. The Pumpkin King.  Anyway, Jack's been feeling a bit depressed lately.  He feels as if something's missing from his life.  When Jack stumbles onto the doorway that leads to Christmastown, he decides to do Christmas for a year and let Santa Claus(or Sandy Claws, as Jack calls him)take a break.  Jack and the other denizens of Halloweentown mean well, but they comically mess up everything up and make toys that are frightening instead of fun.  Also, to make matters worse, Jack has Lock, Shock, and Barrel(Halloweentown's three most mischevious citizens)kidnap Santa, they take him to the Boogeyman, the one truly evil resident of Jack's kingdom.  After Jack finds out that Boogeyman's got his claws on Santa, it's up to Jack to rescue him.	5.0	Very funny movie!	2002-09-19	0	0	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2MDQGNPAWPYTQ	danasfaith	"I was sixteen years old when The Nightmare Before Christmas was first released in 1994. I knew absolutely nothing of what it was about. I'd see full page magazine ads featuring drawings of Jack, Sally, Lock, Shock, Barrel et al. The ads told me nothing. They merely said ""Meet Jack"" or ""Meet Sally"". What I did know was that it was a vision of Tim Burton, one of my all time favorite directors, and based on those ads alone, there was no way I was not seeing this film. I couldn't wait. Finally it hit theatres, and I was right there opening weekend. The theatre was sparce, it was not drawing large audiences initially. In fact, upon both of my viewings in the theatre, several people actually got up and walked out in the middle of the film. I could not understand this. For as soon as the film opened I'd tears literally streaming down my face in awe. It was the most original, beautiful, and unique vision I'd ever witnessed. I remember being made fun of because I loved the film with my whole heart, while I listened to others call it ""stupid"" and ""boring"" and other horrible names. Plot wise, it is really very simple. Our main character, Jack, The Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, has grown so tired of the same routine. He feels something is deeply missing in his life. That his life has in fact become meaningless. Upon a deep walk into the unknown forest to ponder these things Jack stumbles upon the door to Christmas Town and literally falls through it by accident. In Christmas Town, Jack (speaking voice by Chris Sarandon, singing voice by Danny Elman) feels joy and happiness. The absence of ghouls and fear perplexes him. It's a feeling of warmth and love, one he wishes to take back with him to Halloweentown. So Jack devises an elaborate scheme to ""Kidnap The Sandy Claws"" and take over Christmas. All the denizens of Halloweentown seem excited and eager to be a part of Jack's plan, including The Mayor (voiced by the late Glenn Shadix), Halloween's finest trick-or-treaters -  Lock (voiced by Paul Reubens), Shock (voiced by Catherine O'Hara), and Barrel (voiced by Danny Elfman), and Dr. Finkelstein (voiced by the late William Hickey). The only character who sees imminent danger in Jack's plan is Sally (voiced by Catherine O'Hara), a rag doll created by Dr. Finkelstein. Sally secretly pines for Jack, who fails to notice the open offering of her heart, and genuinely fears for his safety and well being in a plan she knows to be wrong. In essence, Sally's love for Jack makes up the heart of the story and is the glue which ultimately holds it together. The only real character to be feared is Oogie Boogie (voiced by Ken Page), the Boogeyman of Halloweentown, who happens to employ Lock, Shock, and Barrel. The Nightmare Before Christmas is visually stunning and contains likely the best songs I've ever heard in an animated feature. It is filled with beauty and tragedy and deep underlying life lessons. The film gives deeper meaning to all holidays, the reasons they exist, and the importance of celebration. I've always stood by The Nightmare Before Christmas and it remains one of my absolute favorite films of all time. I would caution the parents of very young children, as the film may be too scary for small eyes. The thing that miffs me personally, not that it is undeserving, is how popular the film became over a decade after its original release. For some reason, the film seemed to generate with new audiences and ultimately has become a cult classic. But for the record, I was there in 1994, on opening weekend, and I knew then that it would be one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces I'd ever have privilege to witness. Though I'm certain The Nightmare Before Christmas is enjoyed by children, I label it as an adult film and always have. I highly recommend this edition, which is filled with special features, including Tim Burton's original short film Frankenweenie (1984)."	5.0	The Nightmare Before Christmas	2012-12-31	0	0	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A169I83JL8QJGN	Daniel A Moir	I only had this film on DVD and needed an excuse to upgrade, this combo package gave me the excuse I needed. I am a huge fan of 3D when it is done right, and I recognize converted films don't always look great in 3D, but this one is actually pretty nice. The 3D does work very well by way of adding depth to the film, it's like you're watching through a window, though this feature is more like a value added bonus, it doesn't really add anything to the film itself because the film was not originally intended to be a 3D film. Still it looks good as a nice bonus and you shouldn't shy away from this package, especially if you were turned off by Clash of the Titans, this film makes the case that you can have good 3D conversions.	4.0	3D as value added feature works	2011-09-04	8	7	1

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the few truly visionary motion pictures of the last couple of decades.  The bizarre story is one only Tim Burton could tell, and he brings that story to life with some of the most impressive animation I've ever seen.  Stop-motion animation requires infinite care and patience to create, and one could easily forgive any slight hitches that result - but you'll find no imperfections at all here, as the animation rolls along beautifully and naturally.  As for the story, I found it good but not great, but the dark and imaginative vision behind it all more than makes up for any flaws in the writing.Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, has grown bored of all the scary shenanigans to which his land is dedicated to producing, finding little joy in topping his past accomplishments each year.  Wandering off alone, lost in thought, he happens to come across a sort of holiday crossroads, which leads him to Christmas Town.  It's a world like nothing he's ever seen before, and the Christmas magic quickly captures his heart and soul - so much that he returns home to refashion Halloweentown in the guise of Christmas Town.  He has a hard time communicating the spirit of Christmas to the townsfolk, but his perseverance pays off in the transition of the local industry from scary items to Christmas toys and gifts (unfortunately, gifts such as shrunken heads aren't exactly what little Johnny or his parents are particularly looking for).  As Christmas approaches, Jack prepares to don the red suit and white beard, hook up his remodeled coffin sleigh to the reindeer created by the local mad scientist, and sail off into the night to deliver toys to all the good little boys and girls - after he has the real Santa Claus kidnapped, of course.  Only Sally, a rag doll who loves Jack from afar, sees just what a disaster this is in the making.  With Santa suffering torture at the hands of the Bogeyman, it looks like Christmas is doomed for sure.I don't see this as a children's movie, although children will no doubt be delighted by all of the dark and wacky animation.  I also found the somewhat rushed ending somewhat ambiguous, especially in terms of Jack's feelings for good old Halloween.  Still, the film does evoke the Christmas spirit somewhat and certainly proves entertaining with its wonderful soundtrack, incredible animation, and dark humor.	5.0	A truly unique, visionary motion picture	2006-12-23	0	0	0

I have recently converted to Blu-ray, so I am still basking in the glow of the clarity of this new format, so bear with me! Inspired by the classic Rankin-Bass stop-motion animation Christmas classics & ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,"" Tim Burton's film tells the tale of Jack Skellington, a kind mis-guided soul who falls in love with Christmas, and attempts to put his own Halloween spin on it, wreaking havoc when the two holidays collide. The characters are memorable: Sally (a Bride-of-Frankenstein-type rag doll who attempts to escape her maker, the twisted Dr. Finklestein), Jack's ghostly pet dog, Zero, the evil Oogie Boogie (a green sack-like boogie-man addicted to gambling), the Mayor of Halloween Town (who actually has two faces that spin around according to his mood and what he wants to show the town!), and Lock, Shock, & Barrel (mischievous trick-or-treaters who kidnap Santa!). The emotion that is able to be achieved by Burton's crew through the puppets is nothing short of astounding, and Burton's Germanic-stylized sets are a visual feast.Bonus features include:New!

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, dissatisfied with his lot in life, decides to take over Christmas in order to bring shrieks of joy rather than terror to the people of the world.  He enlists the twisted denizens of his domain in his cause and it is rather touching to see their inadequate but sincere attempts to understand what brings delight to ordinary people.  As part of the plan, Santa is kidnapped, and the evil Oogie Boogie takes advantage of the situation to attempt a take-over of Halloweentown for himself.This is a very amusing story told through the vanishing art of stop-motion animation.  The visuals are eye-popping, and I fervently hope that director Henry Selick and others will keep the form alive in the face of the onslaught of computer animation.  Danny Elfman's music is enchantingly sweet and catchy, but always a bit creepy and off-kilter as well--perfect for the material.  This world bears the unmistakable mark of producer/co-writer Tim Burton's unique imagination.  Highly recommended./	5.0	Endearing in a creepy way	2004-05-29	0	0	0

Then, there were the constant ads for it at Hot Topic, and Jack appearing on T-shirts left and right well over a decade later.Like Jack, I found myself asking: ""What's it mean?

The brilliant character of Jack Skellington, ""The Pumpkin King"", and Danny Elfman's amazing score and songs carry the show, but there are plenty of other high(low?)lights among the dozens of ghoulish characters and scenes--the two-faced mayor, the Strangelovian mad scientist, the minor-key string quartet...too many to list.  Catherine O'Hara's poignant voicing of the Jack's cautious admirer, Sally, adds a heartfelt touch to what overall is a pretty strange tale--the hijacking of Christmas and kidnapping of Santa Claus by the denizens of Halloween.  My daughter loved this movie too (though she was just born when it came out), but I think I loved it best then and now.  ""Look, Zero--they're thanking us!""

It is a Tim Burton production and practically every film he touches turns into gold. As the case with this one. A Christmas like you've never seen. A Christmas with a little twist of halloween. Jack and Sally's characters in this film make the film extremely memorable with excellent portrayals. Who wouldn't like to see the Boogie Man take on Santa Claus? And the music, none the cheesy as it tends to go with some Disney flicks. This tale is  beautiful and original. Including the music, created and sung by none other than Danny Elfman. They even named a band after Jack Skellington. Heck even Blink 182 mentions Jack and Sally in ""I miss you."" If you are looking for a plot, don't dismay this has one as well and a central theme. So no one should feel left out, even those who enjoy artistic features."	5.0	A Christmas Twist	2005-08-03	0	0	0

I have had it on VHS video, DVD and now Blu-ray. I have even seen it in the theatre in 3D. But on Blu-ray it is amazing, without exaggeration I have probably viewed this flick 20 times. But when I saw it in Blu-ray on a 55"" HD big screen TV played on a Sony PS3, it was like watching it for the first time. I saw things in the background I have never noticed all the rich textures come out, seeing it this way I suspect was the original intent.

It's a sad, adventourous and exciting take on the holidays of Halloween & Christmas and all their many wonders. The tale follows Jack the Pumpkin king who is the leader of Halloween town and all of it's citizens, they go to him to help create, each year, a better and more eventful as well as more scary halloween (kind of like Santa & Christmas).When Jack begins to feel that his reign as Pumpkin king is beggining to upset and bore him, he wonders off into a forrest where he comes about several trees with doors ingraved on them, each one with a different symbol that represents each of our holidays. When he stumbles about the christmas tree he gets very excited and is compelled to open the door and see what lies beyond it. What he finds is ""Christmas Land"" and after the quick but fun number ""Whats This?"" he loads up all of the intruiging contents of Christmas town and heads back towards halloween town where his curiousity compells him to try his own little christmas. He learns a lesson that he will never forget and soon re-takes his prideful position as pumpkin king.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has a great origonal score along with some stand out songs. The effects of the movie are astounding and the voices of each charactor couldnt have been any better, its was a classic then and still remains just thatGrade: A-"	5.0	Burton's non-stop motion masterpeice	2006-04-17	6	4	2

Most stores did not carry the item and those that did, had the ""special edition"" version with a staggering $30 price tag!  This was a Christmas gift--one that was scheduled to be hand delivered on December 14.  While the item was delivered within the required timeline, it was ""loosely"" shrunk wrapped and the DVD rattled inside the case. It did not sound ""broken"" but I wanted to test the DVD because the ""sloppy"" packaging was worrisome.The DVD played on a computer but on no other device.  This included several high end High Definition surround sound entertainment systems to external DVD players connected to old-fashioned tube television sets--including but not limited to a hand-held DVD player.  I received a ""file not found"" and/or ""please insert disc"" on a couple of these units.  Suffice it to say, I paid $30 to Blockbuster so that I could make the delivery on time.The item appears to be pirated.

What makes the Special Edition such a treat is the Behind the Scenes track, where you get to meet the mastermind (Tim Burton) and his talented crew.  Watching it, I was awed by the painstaking detail they went through to produce this film.  Anyone who is studying animation shouldn't miss this segment.As for the deleted animation scenes and storyboards, there were a couple I wish they could have included.  I was glad they left out one storyboard with the Evil Scientist revealing his ""true"" identity.  That, I felt, was an overused plot idea.I had put the previous DVD edition on my wishlist, hoping to get it for my birthday or Christmas, but that didn't happen.

It's essentially everything that was included in the Laserdisc Deluxe Boxed set from a few years back, plus a &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; trailer.The biggest bonus on the disc is the addition of Burton's two short films, &quot;Vincent&quot; and &quot;Frankenweenie.&quot;  &quot;Vincent&quot; is even closer than &quot;Nightmare&quot; at being the ideal film materialization of an Edward Gorey poem, and it's rarely been seen anywhere else. Not to mention the storyboards, commentary track, behind-the-scenes footage, trailers, deleted scenes (which are few in number, as animation is kept to a necesary minimum)...

Go for it. It's five stars for you. You will love it.I NOW wish I'd given it ONE STAR instead of TWO just to balance out the thoughless ""reviews"" giving it 5 stars. I suggest you look at the ALL THE REVIEWS and then sort them by LOWEST REVIEWS FIRST. Read Birthe Jrgensen's  review and The grumpy consumer's review. Both are insightful.The movie has everything you'd think it needed to be great, premise, talent, money, Danny Elfman.Unfortunately for those with more discerning tastes, for those looking for something that deviates from the standard this movie doesn't qualify. IT TAKES NO CHANCES. Only very young children and very sheltered adults would be challenged or scared by this movie.The movie wants to be rebellious but it's not. It's banal. About as scary and rebellious as a corporate book keeper who works for Disney Inc.Elfman's soundtrack could be out of any generic Hollywood movie, it breaks no rules, in fact it follows all rules. IT'S PREDICTABLE. The animation looks great, it's slick as hell, maybe too slick, following all the rules. It's like wine with no quirkyness. As has been mentioned before here it doesn't have the charms of the more ""primitive"" movies made by pioneers like the Quay Brothers or Jan Svankmejer. This isn't art it's entertainment. There is absolutely no innovation here just REFINEMENT of other people's innovations.It is much better when it's not a musical. I think this is were the problem lies. Making it a musical took all the tooth out of it. Especially since the singing is ""standard"" musical fare. If it was Nina Hagen singing... it might have had a chance. Nope. It's too bad because it could have been great. I TRIED to like it, SEVERAL times but there is no ""there"" there. Basically it's BORING.I would recommend ""The City of Lost Children"" if you seek a more adventurous movie. Similar but much more innovative and down right weird. Not animated but it doesn't need to be.One last gripe. Terrible navigations system. However I think most of the navigation interfaces on DVDs are stupidly ""arty."" Not impressed by how clever it is.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2N4266JJ3L5EJ	Dorothy Koeller	"Where to start? Generally speaking, Nightmare Before Christmas is about misunderstood characters who may appear evil or bad, but really are brutally honest, i.e., true to themsleves and true to where they come from, which is a magical place called Halloweentown. With a name like that, you can imagine all types of characters like Oogie Boogie, the Vampires, the Three Witches, the Evil Scientist, et. al. (and my favorite trick or treaters: Lock, Shock and Barrel). More importantly, however, this is the story of Jack Skelligton and self-discovery. As they say, it isn't about the arrival, it's about the journey getting there. I cannot recommend this movie enough except to maybe very small children due to them seeing many of the characters as ""monsters"" that will scare them tykes when they are trying to sleep! There are so many different ways I enjoyed it from the best soundtrack ever (Thanks Mary!) to the funny and crazy characters to the journey that Jack goes through as he finds what it means to be the Pumpkin King!

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1EZMV5DSWU8TU	Draconis Blackthorne	"Into the wonderfully enchanted world of Halloweentown, set on the edge of reality, where your nightmares and dreams live in joyful celebration of the dark and morbid, but in a perpetually playful rapport. Two holidays collide by the curiosity of Jack Skellington, The Pumpkin King, who grows weary of the redundancy of his role, although he always manages to invent something scarier each Halloween than the previous year's. Amidst a fanfare of admirers singing the wonderfully evocative and enchanting ""This Is Halloween"". He arises to take his seat as the fearful Lord of Samhain unto a cavalcade of vampires, werewolves, witches, zombies skeletons, swamp creatures, devils, ghosts, and miscellanious beings, who all herald him as their leader. His depression leads him to explore the unknown in an enchanted forest, where he discovers trees which are essentially doors into the differing holidays' worlds he finds Christmas Town, and remains fascinated by all the shiney baubles and quaint customs until he finally sees the shadow of Santa ""Claws"", which intrigues him even more. He tells the residents of his adventures, describing SC as a huge being with ""bulging sacks and big great arms"" who ""sets to slay with his reindeer on"", and introduces the novel idea of celebrating Christmas in Halloweentown, at which the residents are enthusiastic, but keeping to their natures, transform it into a nightmare of sorts, replicating the traditions with Halloween prankery.Jack sets out to BECOME Santa Claws fir a year, delivering the nefarious gifts to unsuspecting commoners, who receive quite a fright when their presents begin chasing them and eating up their homes. Just splendid. Finally, the military becomes alerted, and he is shot out of the sky, landing in a graveyard, where he focuses himself and becomes determined to ""set things right"". Underlying all of this, there is a romantic element between Jack and Sally, a pretty zombie-like character, reminiscient of a sexy bride of Frankentein-type without the electric-shock hair, who aids Jack throughout the whole tale. In one poignant moment, as she ponders the wonder of the xmas tree, it erupts into flames, which serves as an omen fortelling of impending doom; she tries to warn Jack againmst venturing forth as St. Nick, but his determination grabbed the best of him.Santa is kidnapped by ""Lock, Shock, & Barrel"", the three trick or treating underlings of ""Mr. Oogie Boogie"", and in one instance, actually accidently bunny-nap the Easter Bunny! Eventually, Jack confronts Oogie Boogie in his lambent Lair which appears to be a Hellish Casino, until distracted by the curvy leg of Sally. Santa is scheduled to be chopped up into so much xmas mulch, until rescued by the heroic efforts of Jack. Finally, Santa is released, and Christmas is saved thanks to The Pumpkin King.The musick in this production is scored by Danny Elfman, Satanic Composer Extraordinnaire, is most excellent, incorperating many of the characters from Halloween legend, most wonderfully achieved. The puppetry is remarkable, and lends an evocation towards older productions from the 40's through to the 60's in whjich one might expect Bing Crosby to be crooning; this certainly is a welcomed utilization of a past orthodoxy. Most highly recommended for Infernal Progeny - quite an alternative to the charming, yet redundant productions usually available in the Yuletide season.Moral of the story? Do not attempt to be something you are not.__________________* The Special Addition version also contains two of Tim Burton's earlier films: 'Frankenweenie' and 'Vincent':FRANKENWEENIESet in contemporary suburbia, young Victor Frankenstein happily plays with his aptly named bull terrier ""Sparky"", when the tragic happens... the spunky pooch is hit and killed by a car. Crushed, Victor struggles to acclimate to life without him, when he receives the bright Promethian idea to re-animate Sparky after watching the science teacher demonstrate electrical muscle spasms with an ""ex-frog"".He rushes home to bring his beloved canine partner back to life. Under the suspciious gaze of a neighbor, he gathers the necessary equipment from the garage, and sneaks out to the pet cemetary to disinterr the pup, anxiously awaiting the next storm to arrive, which is fortunately within a couple night's time.Predictably, after studying through several books on the subject, he actually manages to revivify Sparky, who now resembles a patchwork puppy, bolts, scars, and all. Joyful to be reunited with eachother, all seems well until Sparky decides to run amok through the neighborhood, although most of the panic is due to the hysterical nature of a neightbor lady and a whining little girl.When his parents realize that Sparky is actually alive again, they accept his return from the grave, welcoming him back to the family. Eventually, in a classic Hammer scene relative to the tale, the dog retreats to a windmill followed by Victor and the Frankensteins, where it is set ablaze by the frightened mob. Sparky 'justifies' himself by saving the boy, but is consumed in the inferno. Realizing that he saved the boy, everyone now seeks to resurrect Sparky again, via the combined electricity from all their automoblies with battery cables. And thus, little Victor is again reunited with his beloved friend, with a possibe 'bride' to boot.Frankenweenie is a delightful little tale about a boy and his dog which would be appreciated by Infernal Progeny and Tim Burton fantoms alike, with that pleasantly oddball twist on a classic.__________________VINCENTVincent Malloy just wants to be like Vincent Price*, who is superb as the narrator, adding a truly hauntingly evocative touch. He imagines various scenarios and characters, and what he would like to do to certain people...He is a polite boy with vast creative capabilities, whose talents should be channeled into productive practices like writing, painting, drawing, sculpting, and perhaps... film making? It seems Tim Burton was merely exercising his own shadow side by observing his mirror image as a child.Very reminiscient of Edgar Allan Poe in story-telling style, and Edward Gorey in illustration, Vincent looks like Edward Scissorhands as a child, whose vivid imagination takes him to the darkest dimensions of his mind, where he dwells in the shadows, preferring the company of spiders and bats to that of his sister and cats {although I would have preferred cats as well}, which concerns his mother, who admonishes him to go outside and play.Additionally, there are actually several subtle cinematic predecessors in the visuals which prognosticate what was to come, such as an early variation of Jack Skellington, a sandworm, and the appearance of a zombie-like dog which would later re-appear as ""Frankenweenie"".Eventually, his own imaginings overwhelm him, but it is only temporary. Another darkly charming tale of a somewhat strange character which proves to be an exploration into the viewer's own perceptions.________* Mr. Price once stated that he considered narrating this piece true immortality; better than receiving a star on the Walk of Fame."	5.0	Every day is Halloween...	2004-08-07	1	1	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1TJIJKKN15KR9	drqshadow	Tim Burton is one of only a few creative minds who's able to handle creepy, adult material in a way that's not just appropriate, but also downright appealing, to younger audiences. Beetlejuice, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and Edward Scissorhands are all great examples of this trait at play, but of the lot I think this is his most timeless creation - which is odd, since it's the only one he didn't direct. Like the very best fairy tales, it's adventurous and unusual, taking outlandish concepts for granted as a means of sucking the audience into its own private corridor. The plot is predictable and natural, but also doesn't sacrifice its ability to throw the audience for a loop from time to time, and efficiently straddles two holidays in a manner that never feels forced or exploitative. Of course, the visuals are remarkable, bubbling with character, but the music is where it really hangs its hat. Danny Elfman has never felt more naturally at-home in the Burton universe, and considering the pair's long, storied history together, that's quite the achievement. The tunes are occasionally just a bit too catchy for their own good (I've been humming them for the better part of a day now) but that's a small price to pay for a modern fable this good.	5.0	Elfman and Burton's Finest Partnership	2012-12-26	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"Only Tim Burton could produce a holiday musical about Halloween's grotesqueries taking over Christmas.And in fact he did. Burton wrote and produced a charming stop-motion musical called ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" which is as close as we'll ever get to a Burton Christmas film. And there's rarely a dull moment in this town called Halloween -- from start to finish, it's a quirky, macabre, vintage-flavoured ride through the darker side of everybody's favorite holidays.In Halloween Town, the undead Jack Skellington is king, and each Halloween the residents try to make their celebration even more horrible than the year before.But this year, something is missing for Jack, and he starts wondering if scaring people is all his life has. He ends up wandering into a sort of holiday junction, and finds a portal to Christmas Town -- it's full of snow, lights, presents and innocent fun. Jack is instantly enamoured of Christmas, and decides that for this year, the residents of Halloween Town are going to celebrate Christmas.He manages to convince the other Halloween residents -- except the sweet rag-doll Sally -- to go along with his plan. So Halloween Town is redecorated and filled with presents (in a suitably ghastly style) and ""Sandy Claws"" is abducted so Jack can take his place. But are the people of Halloween Town just not suited to innocent merriment, and can the Pumpkin King fill the capacious red suit when Christmas Eve rolls around?The idea of Halloween ghouls and spooks deciding to take over Christmas sounds terribly twee in concept, like a gimmicky children's book. Fortunately Tim Burton's darkly humorous sense of humor and delightfully gothic designs -- as well as Henry Selick's brilliant direction -- end up turning the movie into something that is more than just another kid's movie. Think a Burtonesque ""Princess Bride.""Much of its charm comes from the richness of Burton's visuals -- his Halloween Town is saturated in spiky iron fences, ghost dogs, insects, mad scientists, and a spooky cloudy night that never ends. And though the inhabitants of Halloween Town are devoted to being grotesque and spooky, there's a lighthearted benevolence in their actions at all times. It almost makes Christmas Town look... dull.But it's also an incredibly funny, sweet little movie, with plenty of heart. There's an adorable little love story between Jack and Sally (""My dearest friend, if you don't mind...""), despite Jack's total cluelessness. And Burton weaves in lots of solid musical numbers (""There's children throwing snowballs/instead of throwing heads/they're busy building toys/and absolutely no one's dead!"").But the crown jewel is Burton's macabre sense of humor. Hardly a scene goes by without a creepy gag (one child's present is a shrunken head) or clever dialogue (""Jack, please, I'm only an elected official here. I can't make decisions by myself!""). But the best humor comes from the Halloween-town's residents eagerly trying to be festive, and only making Christmas even creepier than Halloween ever could be.For a skeleton puppet, Jack Skellington is a pretty adorable hero -- he's earnest, generous, but suffers from a bit of ennui from the same old performance every year. His meditative songs about Halloween and his attempts at Christmas add an introspective note to him as well. And he's backed by a bunch of lovable characters, with Sally and the ghost dog Zero at the forefront.""Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a macabre, wildly adorable little movie that reminds us why we love Halloween (besides the candy). Sometimes the dark and fun go hand in hand."	5.0	This year, Christmas is ours!	2008-06-04	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1R2URG8OHNEDS	"Ed Mich ""Ed"""	"The Nightmare Before Christmas. I've grown up with the movie. Back in '93 when I was very young I first saw it. I was too young to complete a complex thought about the film but now I am. I've seen the movie dozens of times between then a now and have been trying to get the DVD for a while now and finally got it recently. Watching the deleted scenes and photos were fun because I got to know what it was like to make the movie and what they did. The movie has been critcally praised and all I've heard were good things from the people who've seen it.The film starts by seeing that all of the holiday's have there own town. Creatures and people representing people heard around that holiday.(Monsters on Halloween,Elfs on Christmas etc)They celebrate that holiday when the time comes and in the woods there are trees with the doors to those places. The story starts in Halloweentown where they are celebrating Halloween. Jack Skellington who is the one loved by most and is the most scariest of all the creatures there. When Halloween ends we learn that Jack has been depressed because it's always the same every year. He ends up walking into the place where all the holidays intersect. He walks into Christmastown and loves everything there. No monsters,no ghouls,no horror. Just happiness and people being jolly. Back at home he ponders about what the meaning of Christmas is only to come up with one solution......to make there own Christmas. Jack and the crew in Halloweentown all make toys they think are beautiful and fun but are really horrible and scary. Jack is warned from his friend Sally who loves his dearly to not go on with it but Jack disagrees. He needs something new to end his Halloween cycle. Jacks big misake is when he sends Halloweentown's finest trick or treaters Lock Shock and Barrel to go and get Santa Clause. The problem is caused when they give him to Oogie Boogie(Bogeyman)and Boogie is a very very evil Halloweentown citizen. Can Christmas be saved?With excellant music and songs by composer Danny Elfman(Spiderman,Planet of the Apes,Novocaines Theme)Great songs include ""This is Halloween"",""Jack's Lament"",""Sally's Songs"",""Jack's Obession"",and ""Poor Jack"".Some scenes may be a little scary to some young kids but The Nightmare Before Christmas has fun for everybody...adults and kids alike.

Dare I say I enjoy it more than ""Titanic"", ""Avatar"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Polar Express"" and the spectacular ""Toy Story 3"" (to name a few)?  Yes, these are all rightfully considered classics I have watched at least 10 times and look amazing in 3D.  ""TNBC"" is the only movie other than ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" that I know I have seen over a hundred times.  I bought it on VHS, laserdisc and it was the very first DVD I owned.  Not to mention all the merchandise!  The 3D edition I now own is gold to me.  Why would I buy another edition?  Why not wait a year or so for a 4K edition?  Is it an overall better transfer with better 3D?  Does it include a lengthy never-before-seen documentary?  Does it come with a book?  Is it limited and worthy as a collectable?  Let me know.  I love this movie so much, I might buy it.  There is nothing I have every seen that looks better to me in 3D.  It was so great it didn't even need it.  I wish they would re-issue ""Corpse Bride"" in 3D. There are not many musicals in 3D.  Only three I can think of which include ""TNBC"", ""Beauty and The Beast"" and ""The Lion King"".  I hope eventually a new live action 3D movie will be made before the genre completely dies again.  I'm hoping to hear more on this."	5.0	BEST 3D MOVIE EVER!!!	2013-06-29	6	1	5

It has been viewed quite a few times, and I never tire of it.&quot;Nightmare&quot; has great music, some haunting and some fun(&quot;What's this is my personal favorite), great animation, and I love the story.Jack Skellington, the pumpkin King, is the main character.  At the end of Halloween he is all in a tither as to what to do next?  The next major holiday with a figure is Christmas.  Wwhile wondering in the woods, he discovers the gateways to other holidays.  He falls into &quot;Christmas Town&quot; and is in awe.He comes up with the idea of stealing Christmas as he isn't in the mood to wait around for the next Halloween. After discovering Christmas, Jack spends half his time trying to figure it all out and understand it.This film is a bit dark, and I certainly don't recommend it as a family film.  I say parents should watch it first, alone, then decide for themselves if they think their children will be okay with it.  There are some scary ghoulish images.I personally think it's an adult movie, with it's dark humor and imagery.Decide for yourself..it is worth it.	5.0	Destined to be a classic	2001-12-05	5	2	3

""funkthulhu"""	"Okay, first of all, if you haven't been living in a cave for the last 10 years, you know that TNBC has been a mainstay to HotTopic customers and poser-goths for years.  This review is not for those people.I will admit that I really enjoy this movie, but I had some problems with this presentation.  First of all is image quality.  It seemed to me like this was a burn to disk from someones well worn VHS tape.  I don't have a fancy-schmancy HDTV or anything, just an old fashion 32"" tube TV, and this still seemed a bit fuzzy at times, especially the special features and extras.However, my biggest beef is with the sound.  The balance for 5.1 is just . . . Off.  The back ground music was way to loud in comparison to the whispers of full screen characters trying to talk to me through the center channel.  Furthermore, I had to turn the volume up significantly because the audio track as a whole was so quiet.  When I turned back to regular TV I nearly blew speakers.So, in the end.  TNBC is a great movie, and most who will buy this likely have already.  If you're actually thinking about purchasing for the first time, I'd wait if I were you.  I mean, it's been years and years since this movie was first released, if you wait that long again there's sure to be a new remix/mastered edition on the shelves.  Probably the same edition I'll buy like I have so many others.On a final note, the aspect ratio of this film is so close that of a standard TV that I at first thought somebody had slipped me a fullscreen version by accident.  However, upon turning all the lights off in the room I could see the feint bars at the top and bottom.  No biggie, all the action is center screen anyway, maybe it was cheaper to film at 1:1.6 instead of something grander."	4.0	"1:1.6 can hardly be considered ""wide screen"""	2006-03-03	3	3	0

The stop-motion animation featured here is so much better than the crappy CGI animation found in ""Chicken Little,"" ""Kung Fu Panda,"" etc. The songs are quite catchy, and I find myself humming them after I see the movie, and listen to the soundtrack. The character designs are spectacular and purely Burtonesque (even though Burton didn't direct this film). It's a fantastic movie, and it first both Halloween and Christmas respectively.Grade: A+"	5.0	I don't really have to say . . .	2008-10-28	1	1	0

Yes, I noticed the SMALL red warning, not nearly noticeable enough. I am really upset that after waiting and specifically choosing a seller one state away from me to get it sooner, this DVD won't play. Why would a DVD seller from the states make DVDs formatted for South Africa? Amazon should look into a better way of warning it's buyers before purchase of regions. I wasn't aware that they even existed. Now I have an open DVD that the seller probably won't even take back because the seal has been broken.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1JBBR4MNGQ70G	Falkor The White Luck Dragon	Wow, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CRISTMAS has to be one of the greatest animated films ever made. In it, Tim Burton creates a fantastic and brilliantly imagined world full of magic and wonder. The movie captures the viewer's imagination from the beginning and never lets go. Each frame is filled with enchanting imagery, from pumpkin patches to glistening snow fields. The musical numbers are superb, ranging from jazzy show tunes (Oogie Boogie's Song) to hauntingly beautiful ballads (Jack's Lament.) These songs have wonderful melodies, superb vocals and intelligent lyrics that add emotional depth to the film and advance its plot. The amount of detail in this movie is just amazing and rewards repeated viewings. The characters are fascinating and their voices, motions and expressions are all flawlessly done. Danny Elfman really deserves a lot of credit for putting so much emotion into the singing voice of Jack and writing such a great score. The movie goes from darkly funny to moving and everything in between. A wonderful film that delights the senses and imagination.DON'T MISS IT!	5.0	WHAT'S THIS?	2006-10-30	0	0	0

I saw this movie many years ago and sincerely I didn't remember almost anything, but now with this DVD I had the opportunity to live again the experience of TNBC and I was simply amazed!!!.The movie has a Broadway Musical feeling, the songs are awesome, and here are some little news for you. I bought the Edition made specially for Latin America, and the film has the entire audio in Spanish and Portuguese, including the songs !!! The translation is perfect (I speak the three languages) and the singers are very good (Perhaps not as great as the originals) but its very delightful to listen Jack and the whole cast singing in spanish and portuguese.The extra features were not translated. The faults in this version are that VINCENT is not included, neither the trailers,and the audio is 5.1 (not DTS)in English and Dolby Digital in Spanish and Portuguese but anyway, I can sacrifice those for having the latin audio.The name of this version is ""El EXTRA&Ntilde;O MUNDO DE JACK"" in spanish or ""O ESTRANHO MUNDO DE JACK"" in Portuguese.Enjoy it !!!"	5.0	AMAZING !!!

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1FD8LITJZE48V	"Frank Ponce ""Movie Mavin"""	Director Tim Burton delves us into the world of THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, an fantastic stop-action animation fantasy, which begins in the scary world of Halloweentown, where the infamous town resident, Jack Skellington, becomes dreary of the tiring celebration of Halloween. But he then is magically transported to a wonderful land called Christmastown and is fascinated about it! He then convinces his fellow town to celebrate Christmas, and kidnap Santa Claus! But everything doesn't go according to plan.NIGHTMARE, like any animated movie, has great songs, and also has a spooky atmosphere with scary characters from Halloweentown, including the rag-doll Sally, who is vying for Jack's affections, and Oogie-Boogie, the tormented entity.This film is rated PG because it may scare some little kids with its adult humor, but they will eat it up anyway!

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AX93788O8JGBK	Gargamel	This is a delightful film about a misunderstood character who just wants to create a good time for everybody, but unwillingly ends up destroying everything. The character is Jack Skellington. As mayor of Pumpkin Town (in the land of Halloween) he has gotten tired of his everyday routine and the annual celebration of Halloween no longer gives him any thrills (it's the same year in and year out for him). So in order to spice up his life he decides to take over Christmas. Henry Selick might be the director of this film, but it's clear that he's gone to great length in staying with producer Tim Burton's original vision for the film (this has been a pet-project of Burton ever since his days at Disney). This film is as Burton-esque as BEETLEJUICE, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and BATMAN RETURNS (and everything else that Burton has done). And Danny Elfman (of course) provides a great score for this film (I highly recommend the soundtrack CD). Plus (if you're a true Burton fan) you'll be happy to know that the producers of this disc has chosen to include two of Burton's earliest projects (which he did while working for Disney as an animator): the lovely VINCENT and the James Whale tribute FRANKENWEENIE are both on this disc!	5.0	I love that Jack Skellington	2001-06-10	3	2	1

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AQSQLWD3NLMAS	Glenn A. Buttkus	"Tim Burton's name is above the title, and it was ""his"" film, even though he didn't direct it. He had his old pal, Henry Selick, whom he had gone to school with at Cal Arts, and worked with at Disney, direct it. Burton came up with the idea, while at Disney. He wrote at epic poem, and made some sketchs. Disney shot the idea down, but they filed it away as their property. Many years later, after Tim Burton had achieved success as a director, when he reapproached them with the concept, they were only too happy to finance it; to the tune of $20 million bucks.Selick and Burton had collaborated in 1982, on Burton's stop-action short, VINCENT. Stop action animation, owing a lot to pioneers Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen, is very time consuming. This film took three years to complete. With a crew of over 400, Selick could only produce one minute of finished film for every weeks work. The film was 76 minutes when it was released. They were influenced by the films done in the 1920's, called German Expressionism; like NOSFERATU, and THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.NIGHTMARE is really more a musical, than most Disney animated films that contained musical interludes. Danny Elfman, used by Burton for BATMAN and SCISSORHANDS, did the music. Most of his tunes were quite pedestrian; almost Gilbert and Sullivan operetta stuff. It needed the hand of say an Alan Menkin, or Elton John. Elfman sang all the songs for the main character, Jack Skellington. Chris Sarandon voiced the small amount of dialogue not sung.What has emerged is a wonderfully wicked and twisted fairy tale. It was like letting Playboy's cartoonist, Gahan Wilson, reconfigure the Brothers Grimm. And it owed a lot to Dr. Seuss. There was the tone of the Grinch here and there. Fairy tales in their original form, were somewhat dark, bloody and heavy-handed. Over the centuries we have let Walt Disney and Madison Avenue douse them with saccharine, and blunt many their lovely barbs and thorns.Catherine O'Hara did the voice work for Sally, Jack's patchwork girlfriend. William Hickey voiced the wicked Dr. Finkelstein, and he was inspired in his interpretation. Paul Reubens did the voice for one of Jack's henchmen; the one called Lock. Ken Page voiced Mr. Oogie Boogie, who was fairly scary, and Ed Ivory did St. Nick.I liked this film better during the second viewing, but its dark vision still left the bitter taste of rusty metal in my mouth. I prefer my Christmas films a bit sweeter, I guess. Some might argue the this film is more a Halloween film than a Christmas film. Whatever it is labeled, it remains creative, unique, twisted, and delightful."	3.0	Fangs of St. Nicholas	2004-12-10	16	9	7

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3LU79BYMWZEW9	Gregor von Kallahann	"I videotaped this movie off television several years ago, only to discover that the dang thing turned out so poorly as to be almost unwatchable.  Snow when there wasn't supposed to be any, and lots and lots of Halloween and Christmas confetti.  I dutifully screened it (and kind of enjoyed it nonetheless) but made a mental note to rent or buy a cleaner copy at the first available opportunity.But you know how it is, life gets in the way.  I didn't get around it again until this past holiday season, when I finally felt the urge for something a little offbeat and maybe a little subversive to help slip a bit of tartness into all those sugar plums.  NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS certainly filled the bill--even though it is actually surprisingly sweet natured itself.The link between Halloween and Christmas was always something that as a child, I always assumed everyone ""got.""  For me Halloween was the beginning of the magic season.  If spring and summer were all about down-to-earth, patriotic holidays, mid-fall brought us into the season of the otherworldy and supernatural--starting off a little scary, but ending up with peace on earth and good will toward men, with lots of goodies and feasting along the way.  I think Tim Burton may have been thinking along the same lines when he concocted this delightful tale.Of course, aficiados will be quick to tell you that NIGHTMARE was not actually directed by Burton merely based on an original story by him.  I won't argue, nor do I want to take anything away from director Harry Selick nor from any of the talented scene designers and camera people.  But the film does have Burton's darkly comic yet nonetheless sweet natured sensibility written all over it.And speaking of the visuals, that was the element that was ruined for me the first time out by that inferior video.  The visuals didn't really come out, and to the extent that I could sense their outlines, they didn't seem like they would be all that interesting anyway. How wrong I was. At his best, Burton creates whole new worlds, and that is precisely what his collaborators and stand-in director have done here.  In fact, he they've created more than one (""Halloween Land"" AND ""Christmas Land"").Most kids reach a stage around 12 or 13 when they cultivate a taste for perverse humor.  (I call it the Charles Addams stage, since that's when I first discovered his cartoons--and coincidentally when the series THE ADDAMS FAMILY made its debut).  Burton is a few years younger than I and probably caught the TV show in reruns, but he definitely picked up that sensibility along the way.  Morticia and Gomez actually had a sweet side, but the cartoon image of them and the rest of the clan perched in the rafters and about to pour molten lead on Christmas carolers below is one that I've never forgotten.  (And neither did the makers of ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES since they chose to re-enact that very cartoon as that film opens).  But Burton adds a more whimsical element.  Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, DOES get it.  After much contemplation, he begins to comprehend the spirit of Christmas.The rest of Halloween Town is in ""hot lead pouring"" mode, but Jack sees something else there. Actualizing that vision is farcically beyond him, and that's the heart of the movie.  Jack is really a sweetheart, and he saves the day (that day being Christmas Eve), wins the girl and destroys the baddest of bad guys (the awesomely awful Boogie Oogie).  It's nothing less than you would expect, but the creators have been so imaginative in getting there that you're only to willing allow them a little corn at the ending.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2HD1FY51FM1TW	Grimluke	"I must confess, despite knowing of its existence for years, I never really watched it until recently. Why's that? Because I always thought to myself, ""Tim Burton, plus clay-mation, plus Halloween, equals creepy-and-weird-movie-I-never-want-to-see."" (What? Don't blame me! I was little!) Anyways, after seeing this movie appear in so many different things I like (Disney Infinity, Kingdom Hearts, etc.), I finally decided that I wanted to see this movie. After watching it, I must say, I was impressed. It wasn't the overly dark, disturbing movie I thought it would be. I mean, it still had some stuff that might creep out kids, but it really wasn't all that bad! The first time I saw it, I thought it was good. It wasn't anything like I thought it would be, so I wasn't sure what to think. After seeing it a second time (when I actually know what to expect), I can official say that this is a great movie. Things that I never thought I'd like, I liked! Clay-mation is something I've always considered ugly, and yet in this movie, it was really good! The movement was actually fluent (as opposed to movies like Curse of the Were-Rabbit where the movement was rather freeze-framey). The best part of the movie was the music. I LOVE the songs in the movie! What's This?, This is Halloween, the Oogie Boogie song, and more still play in my head today! In addition to the songs and animation, this movie has a great story, great voice acting, well-written dialogue, and a great main character (Jack Skellington!!!). The bonus features are a nice touch, but the movie's the real prize here! If you've never seen this movie, I'd recommend renting it or checking it out at the library first. This is not everybody's cup of tea. But if you have seen it and liked it, then I WOULD recommend buying this.Final Score: 9.2 out of 10."	5.0	I Had My Doubts, but...	2013-12-07	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1PGC1GEBY9CZU	Happy Camper	One might think Tim Burton teaming up with Walt Disney's company would lead to a muted, if not disastrous, movie.  Not so.  Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas was sure to be a classic the day it opened.Also teaming up, as usual, Danny Elfman (Oingo Boingo's frontman), lends his musical wizardry to this awesome movie.  Additionally, Elfman lends his voice to Jack Skellington during the numerous musical interludes.  Catherine O'Hara lends her pipes to the delightful Sally, Jack's &#34;love interest&#34;.The concept works and works and works.

While they have included great extras like &quot;vincent,&quot; and the picture quality is wonderful, there is a sound defect.  The Mayor's line, &quot;Wait, we haven't given out the prizes yet,&quot; is MISSING.

It has been my favorite since it was released, but I introduced my 2 and 4 year old grandchildren to the video when I purchased this copy.  They are totally mesmerized by the story and the music.  The more they see it, the more delighted they become with the characters and their personalities. They've started to be curious about the way the animation is done, as well.

You guess it, a no brainer here.. X-mas has that Halloween taste.. Yet everyone is so excited nobody can notice it... now you can see how to use this movie for conflict issues... Jack also elevates to his maximum incompetence state (to put it into Dr. Peter's celebrated theory) by hijacking Santa in x-mas night... fortunately reality kicks back to reestablish balance and .. Well see itI thought I did not need any explaining on how to use this movie for conflict issues, so let's begin with the simple things as I would with my teenage son- Discovery of America by the Europeans-  Columbus could not even accept the possibility of a new world, this was India and the natives sure looked like Indians., in turn, when they saw the horses, what could they think of such wonderful beast, what names can they be given?... Venezuela was named because the Spanish saw some villages made over the waters of a lake, and they related to Venice..I could go on with Freud's theories of the psyche, etc but I am tired"	5.0	We see only what we are trained to see	2007-05-11	4	0	4

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	ADEJYIFDD1QGL	I am so smart...S-M-R-T	If you throw all the Hot Topic junk that this movie has created aside, and you focus just on the movie, it is truly a masterpiece in everyway. The lovely thing about TNBC is that it is so beautifully weird. And original. It is based on an idea that...I don't think anyone before Burton could've thought up, even if they were geniuses. And that is why Tim Burton is revered by movie buffs the world over. He is truly a genius.The Nightmare Before Christmas begins with ghoulish music and the dark, almost Hades like settings of Halloween town, one of the many towns that dedicate themselves just to one holiday of the year. And, (obviously) Halloween town is in charge of October 31, Hallow's Eve. Enter Jack the Pumpkin King; a long, lanky skeleton-like individual who walks with the wandering grace of a poet and has the mind of a philospher. Jack is legenday in Halloween town as the ultimate scare-maker. When he scares, he SCARES. And Jack usually loves his job. But lately he's been having qualms...He wonders, what else is there? Que Sally, a rag-doll woman who wants to escape her overly protective, paranoid father/maker Dr. Finklestein  and discover the world as well. Her quiet presence around Halloween town and Jack as he ponders what else is there makes for a great supporting character.Meanwhile, Jack, one day in utter confusion and in search for himself, wanders out of Halloween town and comes across Christmas town, and it is there that he discovers himself (or so he thinks). As he sings the most memorable song I know (What's This?) in awe of the bright, jolly scenery around him and the happy children and...(or course) the snow, he realizes, why not make...Christmas, instead of Halloween? Aha! Jack has found his muse. Jack, in complete glee at his newfound joy, runs back to Halloween town to tell the townspeople of this completely cool new holiday. Christmas. Try as he might, however, the Halloweeners, while they mean well, don't exactly understand the concept. What they think as an ordinary gift (a shruken head, a screaming snake) normal people are terrified. But alas, Jack is oblivious to this and continues with his revolution of Halloween town. And soon he steals good 'ol Chris Kringle himself (even though he means well). And then it begans to spiral downhill from there.But that's not important. I could go on for another half a page describing the utter brilliance of TNBC, but I won't. Instead, I'll just babble a few more lines. This is an amazing work of beauty. Yes it is dark, and yes it is gothic, but the music, and the pure oddity yet sharpness of the animation makes this a must see for anyone, as long as they're above the age of eight. This is the real definition of movie. Please, see it.	5.0	Brilliant. So original...And awesome.	2005-10-02	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A319SKSB556033	"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews"""	"I abstained from Nightmare Before Christmas for years because (much like The Goonies) it has just been forced into popular culture, where I don't think it belongs. Neither film was massively popular or a critical success on their original release, but somewhere along the line the spirit of the films were hijacked.I hate seeing forlorn-looking, middle-class emo teenagers wearing Jack Skellington T-shirts as much as I hate the same crowd yelling ""Hey you, guys."" Were they even born when these films were made? Back to the film itself, it's a rather simple tale of a Halloween-themed world being exposed to the magic of Christmas. Jack Skellington and the denizens of Halloweentown welcome the magic, but no one really seems to understand that the macabre of Halloween and the Spirit of Christmas are utterly incongruous. I suppose this is a commentary on the inconsistency of what the public desires and how we are all easily programmed to like what the media tells us to like.The thin story is interspersed with several, generic Danny Elfman melodies and songs. The characters are amusing, especially the Mayor of Halloweentown, who's double-sided head periodically rotates between happiness and despair. And the atmosphere is also very nice, but I'm undecided if it's a Halloween film or an Xmas film.Overall, it's good, but not great. It's more like The Trap Door than it's like Wallace and Gromit, but still a pleasant distraction for the Xmas season.The Blu Ray looks great in 1.66:1 1080p HD, and has a decent amount of features."	3.0	Xmas Comes to Halloweentown	2010-12-19	51	6	45

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	A film of great interest, artistically. It is a Christmas pantomime that reveals a very high level of technical perfection in  animation. It is a very good musical where music and singing are literally merged into the pictures. It is also a very profound film about children : their expectation of fear with Halloween and of joy with Christmas. Children are just like adults, dark on one side and colorful on the other side, and they don't want the two to be mixed or just to mix. This gives a great attractive power to the film for these children who will be panickstricken by the kidnapping and possible killing of Santa Claus, and who will be thrilled by the frightening characters that haunt our vision of Halloween and this strange night when ghosts come back to roam our streets begging for candy. A classic for children and a piece of artistic pleasure for adults.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU	5.0	Christmas is better than Halloween, but Halloween is best	2004-03-07	1	1	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A26O0T192IBKY1	J. Alford	You can go through Halloween and/or X-mas without watching this precious jewel! Based on his short story, Tim Burton brought back the concept of stop-motion animation with this in a way Gumby never did.Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, and he with his fellow bumpers of the night are in charge of Halloween every year, but totally unaware of any other holidays. After another successful trick-or-treat jamboree, Jack pines for something more to do with his life, and happens to stumble into a magic doorway that leads to Christmas Town, where Santa Claus runs X-mas. Jack falls in love with all things Christmasy, and decides to bring it back home. After doing some more research on it, he proclaims that he'll be the one running Christmas for that year. Everyone in Halloween Town gets on board with it, except for Sally, a Bride of Frankenstein-ish ragdoll girl who has a crush on Jack. Jack sends the trio of Lock, Shock, & Barrel to capture Santa so that he can replace him, but they take Santa to their boss, the slimey Oogie Boogie. Jack's attempt at being Santa totally backfires as he's shot down by the army. He realizes his mistake at trying to take over someone else's holiday, so he goes to get Santa back to save Christmas. Jack battles Oogie in his casino lair to free Santa, where its revealed that Oogie is really a pile of bugs. Santa manages to salvage Christmas for yet another year, and brings the holiday to Halloween Town. Jack then realizes his feelings for Sally, making for a happy ending.This is one of my absolute favorite animated films of all time. When it came out, I was getting out of animation for a while, but this totally brought me back into it. It also makes for a great refresher for the holiday season. As tough as it is to get through that time of year, watching Nightmare always makes it alot more tolerable, and from it you realize that if a skeleton from a horror-based society who knew nothing about Christmas could become a better person after finding it, then it shouldn't be too hard for all the real Scrooges out there either.	5.0	Happy Halloween!

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3RO6CB4EU8DRA	James Head	"Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" directed by Henry Selick, is a classic that is sure to please Burton fans and skeptics alike.  Originally released in 1993, this film was the first full-length stop-motion animated feature to be released.The film traces the wonderfully creepy Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, on his journey to better understand Christmas.  Having become frustrated with the creepy celebrations surrounding each October 31st, Jack encounters the odd-acting residents of Christmas Town and likes (but fails to understand) what he sees there.  In his efforts to spread the joy of the holiday season to the wacky residents of Halloween Town, however, Jack unknowingly wreaks havoc and mayhem on the good boys and girls of the world, attempting to take on the role of jolly St. Nick himself.The story is delightfully original, the characters humorous and zany, and Danny Elfman's score fits the film like a perfectly molded glove.  Keep your eyes peeled for Burton's soon-to-be-released ""Corpse Bride"" as well!  This film was and still is a movie milestone.  Very highly recommended!"	5.0	Frighteningly good fun!	2005-09-05	0	0	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A37HYSC72QKCM5	James P. (Sulley) Sullivan	As a resident of Monstropolis, I never miss this tale of Christmas misfits and monsters! Jack Skellington is a true hero -- a figure kids would be frightened of if he popped out of their closet. Now that's a man I can get behind 100%! Halloweentown is a dark scary place kids would hate, and the animation is top-notch. The songs are also great for scare singalongs. And the finale never fails to bring a tear to my friend Mike's eye. I give it two horns up!	5.0	A heartwarming Christmas monster story!	2001-10-11	9	9	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1F82L055VK27G	James R. Gross Jr.	This is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies.  Tim Burton did a bang-up job with this one.  As a fan of Tim's, I must say that I fell in love with this one almost immediately.  While some may not appreciate the mixing of Halloween and Christmas, I think that the moral of this story is great.  Using comedy and stop-motion animation, Tim illustrates that people need to be themselves.The animation is great and the songs are well-written and sung.  I find myself sing bits and pieces of the various songs throughout the year!  To say that it annoys those around me would be an understatement!My only gripe is that the Digital copy will only work with iPods or devices certified for the Microsoft PlaysForSure program (meaning that my Microsoft Zune is incompatible).I highly recommend this one!	5.0	The Nightmare Before Christmas	2010-01-13	0	0	0

While some mistake it for a Halloween time viewing, it really is a Christmas story in all its elements.  It shows what the true meaning of the yule season should be - joyfulness, giving of yourself to others, and love.Be sure to have this as a traditional viewing every year and watch out for Oogey Boogey!	5.0	Jack Skellington - nuff said	2014-02-26	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2NVHV6YI4QN51	Jay	I have owned every version of this movie since it was released on VHS but this 2 Disc Collectors Edition far surpasses them!  We've all seen the movie so I won't review how great this classic is.  What I want to review is the Bonus Features on Disc 1.They have a feature where Christopher Lee reads Tim Burton's original poem and they even did original animation for the story.  BUt the HIGHLIGHT of the Bonus Features is the part where you get to ride through Disneyland's Haunted Mansion (with complete Nightmare Before Christmas overlay).  The audio & video from the ride is crystal clear.  You can make out every detail of the ride.  But wait!  There's more!  After you experience the ride, you can go behind the scenes and learn more about what went into the making of the ride.  Did you know that every year there is a different Haunted Gingerbread Mansion placed in the Dining Hall?  Neither did I.Disc 2 contains the same Bonus Features that were on the previous version of the DVD.One more thing, when I opened the box, there was a $10 rebate inside for those of us who had the previous DVD.  All I can say is that Haunted Mansion overlay feature paid for itself.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!	5.0	Bonus Features Pay For the DVD Themselves!	2008-09-11	2	2	0

I didn't say anything, or even write any angry e-mails to customer service because I assumed it was my own computer's fault. Today I got a message from Amazon. They refunded my VOD rental because they noticed I had playback issues! That's GREAT customer service.I wanted to put this in some kind of general review for Amazon's VOD but there doesn't seem to be one, so I thought it would be appropriate to put it under the movie I rented.As far as the film goes, Nightmare Before Christmas is a classic.

I thought it just looked plain weird and wrote it off. Finally a friend convinced me to watch it and to my amazement, I loved it! I was amazed at how a stop action animation movie could be so cute and touching! It is filled with humour, fun and great songs, but at the centre of the movie is a wonderful story of acceptance and Jack Skellington's struggle as the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown who wants to be part of Christmastown. Of course I went right out and bought the DVD and have now become a fanatic with shirts, figurines and more!

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ	J. Michael Click	If you think the best movies are the ones that show you a world you've never envisioned before, then you will LOVE Tim Burton's &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;.  A benchmark in stop-motion animation, this incredibly difficult-to-make film (24 individually posed frames were needed to produce ONE SECONDS's worth of action) is a masterpiece of art direction, set design, and good old-fashioned storytelling.  The plot revolves around Jack, the Pumpkin King of Halloween, and his attempt to run Christmas in place of Santa Claus.  &quot;Sleigh&quot; becomes confused with &quot;slay&quot;; &quot;stockings&quot; become &quot;stalkings&quot;; and spirits go from joyous to ghostly as the two holidays clash together like oil and water, or fire and ice.  One of the great surprises of the movie is that although it dances around material that could easily careen into cynicism, it remains refreshingly sweet and light throughout.  Which is not to say that some of the comedy isn't a little dark and perhaps geared more towards older children and adults; for example, the brief scene in which a python puppet is shown swallowing a Christmas tree whole is hysterically funny, but not especially appropriate for the very young.The special edition DVD is unquestionably the version of this classic to buy.  Included are a wealth of extras: the teaser and theatrical trailers; a documentary on &quot;The Making of ...&quot;; deleted scenes and storyboards, etc, etc.  The best bonuses are two short films by Burton: &quot;Vincent&quot;, a poetic tribute to the magnificent Vincent Price, narrated by the subject himself; and &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;, a canine send-up of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, starring Shelley Duvall, Daniel Stern, and a cast of talented character actors.  This DVD is one that you can spend HOURS exploring happily!  Highly recommended as both a Halloween and Christmas treat.	5.0	A Special Edition that is TRULY Special	2001-12-10	207	182	25

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"A film by Henry SelickJack Skellington is the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.  Jack is tired of the same old Halloween with the same old scares and the same old countdown to the next Halloween.  Depressed by the routine, Jack walks away from Halloweentown and discovers a door in the forest.  This door has the image of a tree engraved on it and through the door Jack discovers Christmastown!  Singing ""What is this?"" (a great song), Jack discovers the wonder of Christmas and decides that he wants to bring Christmas to Halloweentown.  When he returns, he gets the whole town to prepare for Christmas.  He explains that it doesn't matter what is in the present, but only that it is wrapped and looks pretty.  To make sure that Jack can be the new Christmas King, he has Santa Claus kidnapped.I don't think ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is appropriate for the youngest viewers because it will probably be too scary for them.  It was a little creepy for me, and I'm 25.  It was also a very good movie.  I'm always apprehensive about musical numbers, but there are some very good songs (a highlight that I've mentioned is Jack's song ""What is this"" as he discovers Christmastown), and fanstastic animation.  Tim Burton is one of the screenwriters and it has some of the darker hallmarks that are a part of his work.  This is a great movie for Halloweentime, Christmastime, or any time of the year."	5.0	great animation, but a little creepy	2004-05-24	1	1	0

The color and shadings are more impressive than it has ever been seen in Theaters.  The depth looks verymuch like the 3D film that was re-released last year.

"I have nothing but admiration for the talented and VERY PATIENT guys who endevour to make a movie based on stop/start photography. This must truly be a ""labour of love"" and the results of their efforts are wondrous. The viewer is introduced to Jack Skellington who is the King Of Halloween but has become jaded with this annual event. There must be millions of guys out in tedious jobs who can relate to Jack's predicament. Then to Jacks great surprise and delight he discovers ""Christmastown"" where everything is shiny and beautiful. So Jack then kidnaps Santa Claus in the hope of reproducing a wonderful Christmas for all. I marvel at  the novel concept of this movie in a time where most producers are just making stupid ""Teenage Sex Comedies' which feature male virgins and of course the obligatory prostitute. This movie is a gem for young and old and I also have got to mention Jack's long suffering girfriend who also springs to vivid life in this movie.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A168VXSISJWQN9	"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover"""	Like many others, we have made this movie into a tradition. After the Halloween trick or treating is done, we settle down and watch TNBC. It creates a great transition between the two holidays.I think this is one of Danny Elfman's best movies. The Halloweentown songs are suitably creepy, but 'What's this?' has a very Christmassy feel of excitement. I love the use of color, too; appropriately gloomy for the Halloweentown sequences, but bright and cheerful for Christmastown. The story is original and the characters are memorable. There's a lot of humor, as you might expect, but some of the scenes might be frightening for younger children, so use some discretion as to what age you feel they can watch it without being too scared.A fun movie which repays watching over and over; there's always something new to see.	5.0	A specter calls	2012-09-12	0	0	0

Along the way, the jack-o-lantern-headed Jack (amiably voiced by Chris Sarandon) has to square off against his evil nemesis, Oogie Boogie (Ken Page), who has sinister plans of his own. With Danny Elfman's frightfully jolly score and a bright script based on characters Burton created, this is a ""Nightmare"" the whole family will enjoy (though smaller fry might get spooked at times)."	5.0	The Nightmare Before Christmas	2007-07-17	2	2	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1COW0UIB5HA9J	"John Lindsey ""John"""	"In the world of Halloween in a special town called HalloweenTown, the Pumpkin king named Jack Skeleton (Voiced by Chris Sarandon and sung by Danny Elfman) has grown tired of the same old thing year after year. He feels bored as one day he discovers a tree with a door into the world of Christmas as it brightens him up and gives him great ideas to something new and different for once. He decides to give the idea of Christmas to his world and wants to spread joy to many boys and girls with Santa Claus being replaced by him. Unfortunately when Jack thinks he's going good playing Santa to the real world's boys and girls he spreads terror by accident but has to find a way to fix it including saving Santa's life.Co-starring the voices of William Hickey and Catherine O'Hara, this is one of the greatest and most visually stunning animated epics yet. Based on a book and story by Tim Burton, this unique and imaginative animated feature became one of 1993's most critically acclaimed and popular hits that still remains popular to this day. Sure it has spawned merchandise and stuff but this is one of Tim Burton's best movies even though he didn't direct it but produced it and the songs are memorable as hell like ""What's this?"" and ""This is Halloween"". It's an exciting, dark and funny flick with an original concept and surely one movie that the entire family will enjoy but it's too scary for younger audiences, the animation is brilliant stop-motion and the voice acting is terrific.This 2-Disc Blu-Ray contains brilliant sound and picture that is pitch perfect! the extras are phenomenal such as Trailers, audio commentary, Haunted Mansion/Nightmare Before Christmas tour with on or off triva track, ""Frankenweenie"" uncut version with introduction by Tim Burton, Behind The Scenes making of ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" documentary, ""Vincient"" original short film by Tim Burton, Deleted Scenes, Story-to-film comparision, Blu-Ray exclusive Tim Burton introduction, Original Poem story that inspired the film narrated by Christopher Lee, three featurettes and poster gallery."	5.0	A Christmas and halloween masterpiece!	2004-12-28	0	0	0

To  put it short: This film is one of the best I've ever seen.  It's fun, has  amazine visuals, a clever story, and great music and songs.  It's was a  shame it got rated PG, for some reason parents wouldn't take their children  to it.  The only reason it was rated PG is because it may be too scary for  kids under 5.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A10G4BPT5MGBHY	Julie Neal	"Note: This is a review of the 2008 DVD releaseWhat's this? A new ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" DVD package? Actually there are three versions: this two-disc set that includes a downloadable digital copy, aBlu-rayversion, and acollector's editionthat comes with a bust of Jack Skellington with a detachable Sandy Claus beard and hat.Though this version is billed as a two-disc set, it actually has three discs. The third one contains the digital copy. An instruction sheet spells out in clear steps how to download the file to an iPod or similar device.The movie itself is a feast for the eyes, ears and imagination. A delectable witches' brew of stop-motion animation, catchy show tunes and a seriously warped creative license, it always stays true to its timeless message: to be happy, be yourself. Devilishly nonconformist, it's an enduring holiday musical for the whole Addams family.Well, almost. Though all of its fright gags are played entirely for laughs, some of the imagery is downright creepy, especially for small children. Anyone older than say, 6, however, should enjoy every minute. Teenagers will love it.The story -- the citizens of Halloweentown attempt to annex neighboring Christmastown -- comes from the macabre mind of producer Tim Burton, who wrote it in his spare time (as a poem!) while working as a Disney animator in the 1980s. The movie blends the tastiest bits of Burton's earlierBeetlejuiceandEdward Scissorhandswith a sprinkling of the stop-motion magic first found in Disney's 1961Babes in Toyland.The imaginative cast of characters includes:* Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), a mischievous misfit who believes his purpose in life is to merge the holidays of Halloween and Christmas.* Jack's faithful dog Zero, a ghost with a glowing, jack-o'-lantern nose who, like the hound inHow the Grinch Stole Christmas, eventually pulls a sleigh* Rag-doll heroine Sally (voiced by Catherine O'Hara), Jack's love interest, who sews herself back together when she loses a body part* Oogie Boogie (Broadway veteran Ken Page), a slimy, singing bag of bugs who channels the cartoon version of Cab Calloway in the oldBetty Boopcartoons* Lock (Paul ""Pee-Wee Herman"" Reubens), Shock (O'Hara) and Barrel (Danny Elfman, the film's composer), a trio of evil trick-or-treaters who ""kidnap the Sandy Claws""* Wheelchair-bound evil scientist Dr. Finklestein (William Hickey), a duckbilled quack whose flip-top head lets him scratch his brains for inspiration* A mayor (Glenn Shadix, the interior director Otho inBeetlejuice) who is literally two-faced.Blessed with the ability to bring adult minds back to child's level, Burton dwells in dark mischief. In fact, some of Nightmare's best scenes include the kidnapping of Santa Claus and Jack's hilarious attempt to replace him on Christmas Eve, when the skeleton gleefully delivers presents such as tree-devouring snakes and severed, shrunken heads.Director Henry Selick painstakingly created the film over three years. Though he had a production crew of over 100, each minute of footage took a week, as each second required 24 ever-so-slightly different shots.BONUS FEATURESThis 2-disc DVD package has a nice collection of extras:* An audio commentary with Burton, Selick and Elfman.* A downloadable digital copy of the film, which you can transfer to an iPod or similar device.* Burton's first short, 1982's 6-minute ""Vincent,"" a black-and-white stop-action film about a boy who dreams of being Vincent Price, who narrates.* Burton's 1994 Disney live-action short ""Frankenweenie."" This 30-minute black-and-white film re-imagines the Frankenstein story as the tale of a young boy and his car-struck pet dog in suburban America. A recently taped introduction by Burton shows some working sketches being used for his full-length version now in development.* A reading of Burton's original ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" poem by actor Christopher Lee* A promotional film for the annual ""Nightmare"" makeover of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion.* Promotional and making-of featurettes, a storyboard to film comparison, deleted scenes and theatrical trailers and posters"	5.0	Be True to Your Ghoul	2008-06-17	136	126	10

The exception is for holiday movies.  I consider this to be one of the classics we have to have on hand at the holidays.  It's just so different from the others.

I bought the VHS the first day it came out, and now I'm a proud owner of the DVD. The art direction is possibly the best part of the whole project, but the music and theme all tie in perfectly to make it a must-see title around the holidays, or practically whenever you're sifting through your collection.

Amazon should no longer sell this product, especially since they sell a more recent version wothout the expired digital copy. Plus, they should post this in the item description notifying all cutomers of the expiration date. This would have saved me a lot of time if I would have known this in the first place.

Watch Jack as he tries to recreate the holiday that we all love with his Halloween buddies while getting into some trouble and love along the way.What is it about this movie that brings in goths and children alike? Tim Burton is well known for his darker sense of understanding when it somes to his work that makes him brilliant. Other works, such as &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, and &quot;Big Fish&quot; bring audiences rolling in to see what he has come up with this time.This movie has all the sense of a harmless movie, but brings it all into a darker perspective that just grips the soul. Whether it be bright colors, a happy family, or an everyday outting, Tim Burton draws the more odd and darkened shade out of it. With wonderful songs and a cast you can't forget, this is one movie that sucks you in.	5.0	What is is about this movie?	2004-02-26	0	0	0

This is partly due to originally being a 2D stop-motion film vs. a computer generated animation like most. The lack of colors and the many dark scenes it includes also hampered the 3D.Active Glasses Users: I detected 19 instances of crosstalk but realistically only 5 times the ghosting was easily noticeable. (on my system)MY 3D RATING = GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing.

Not because of the gifts and festivities, but because that is the only time when network television would air the Rankin/Bass Christmas specials.  Tim Burton's work on ""Nightmare"" brought back the giddiness I felt as a child.  The direction is flawless, but if not for Danny Elfman's composing, I am not sure this would be the same film.  My 2 year old son loves this film, and can sing bits of ""What's This"", as it is his favorite song.  I recommend this film to everyone, from 2 to 92.

This is one of my all-time favorites, and my two year old daughter's as well.  Truly a movie for all ages.  I absolutely love Danny Elfman's songs in this film - haunting, yet empathic.  This movie is not as boisterous as Beetlejuice, but is more subtle in it's message, like Edward Scissorhands.  Kids will love the fun characters and music; as an adult I love the artistic rendering that has been given to the set, characters, and music.  Where stop-motion animation is concerned, it is, technically, by far the best ever made to date.  The movement is very fluid, not at all like the Christmas classics I grew up with.  I am surprised by how many people I have met who have never seen this movie- in our household, it is not only a semi-annual tradition (shown on both Hallowe'en and Christmas) but is also a day-to-day favorite, good for viewing anytime you want to watch a fun film.  This DVD edition contains more worthwhile extras than almost any other DVD I've ever owned, including great short films, documentaries and commentaries.	5.0	See this movie	2003-01-27	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1MYX3IQ09D6XY	Kevin James	The idea of Halloween trying to annex Christmas is wonderfully unique and played out brilliantly by a cast of unforgettable characters.Most of the film takes place in Halloween Town--a delightfully strange and eerie place inhabited by dozens of bizarre, yet lovable creatures. Most notably the main character, Jack Skelington - The Pumpkin King, who is in charge of the yearly preparations for Halloween. One day, Jack stumbles into Christmas Town, a world much more colorful and cheery than his own. Jack is so enthusiastic about Christmas that he figures why not have the residents of Halloween Town put on Christmas this year? After all, wouldn't scaring little children and delivering gifts like snakes and shrunken heads make Christmas even better?  Jack is a sweet skeleton with his heart is in the right place, however...........well, you can imagine.The time and effort taken to create the stop-motion animation in NBC is mind-boggling. I still can't figure out how they created some of the effects.  This is one of those films that commands repeat viewing. I've watched the DVD several times and I always see something new that I hadn't caught before. The attention to detail is magnificent.NBC is a little off the beaten path (it's rated PG), however keep in mind that even though Santa Clause (&quot;Sandy Claws&quot;) is kidnapped and held hostage, the movie has a happy ending.The DVD picture and sound quality (Dolby Digital and DTS) are absolutely marvelous, and the disk is loaded with tons of wonderful extras.	5.0	This year, Christmas will be OURS!	2002-08-20	2	1	1

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1Z90AW84K4YUS	Key	Perfect film to watch with family and friends for Halloween AND Christmas! Or in fact, any day of the year. Really, it's quite good (OK, it's REALLY great). Very dark in its design but it also contains a very uplifting tale and I think anyone of any age can enjoy (though perhaps not the wee ankle biters--the ghouls might scare them).The stop-motion animation in NIGHTMARE is quite amazing and a treat for the eyes. Honestly, it's quite extraordinary what the animators and director did with both character design/movement and camera-panning. The songs by Danny Elfman are... wow. Singable, catchy, some a bit melancholy, others just pure fun. Never, ever boring. So what are you wasting your time for with reading this review? At least go out and rent this masterpiece. :)	5.0	Eeeeexcellent...	2005-01-01	3	1	2
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A251UPF3VGKRE0	Kick A. Hole Soup	The Nightmare Before Christmas may not be for everyone.  Themes that include torturing Santa Claus, toys that assault children, and the absolute removal of all religious connotation to two very religious holidays may raise some objections.  That said, I think it is one of the greatest movies ever made.  Danny Elfman's score is a masterpiece, Henry Selick's mastery of stop motion animation is in its element here, and although Tim Burton did not direct the film, its got his signature all over it.  Jack Skellington's image has snuck its way into films by both Burton and Selick simply because they felt the final product was the perfect execution of a dream.  The more I watch this movie, the more I understand the sentiment.I fell in love with this movie when I first saw it in '93.  My son fell in love with it six years later when he was 3.  A little young to be watching a movie with the aforementioned themes?  I really don't think so.  As a parent, I keep my child away from television or films that encompass any degree of violence (the absolute worst he sees is Toy Story; I cringe whenever Buzz and Woody start swinging at each other).  Yet I really don't find anything in Nightmare objectionable; Jack's motivations are nothing but good-natured, and the images of torture and assault are really nothing more than innocent expressions of the inhabitants of Halloween Town (they'd hardly be out of place on Halloween).  And that's really what the ultimate message of the story is: Hold on to your dreams, but don't lose sight of who you are or where you came from.As I said, my son loves the movie, which means I've now seen it well over a hundred times.  I still love watching it.	5.0	One of the greatest movies ever made	2001-06-01	6	5	1
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king, is the Halloween planner for Halloweentown and after another successfully Halloween that was scarier that ever he drifts off in melancholy.  Jack seems to have found himself in a brainy predicament as he tries to find reason in what he does and why he exists.  In contemplation Jack stumbles through a deep forest until he discovers an opening in the woods where there are a number of secret doors that lead to all the different holidays.  Jack decides to peek behind the door with the Christmas tree, but a strong wind pulls him in and he falls into a Christmas Town.  Flabbergasted Jack learns about this new and strange holiday as he is amazed about the peculiar traditions of Christmas Town and its leader, Santa Claus.  As Jack returns to Halloweentown he informs the citizens about Christmas Town and its scary leader, which leads him to want to give the people a Halloween styled Christmas, but there seems to be some dangers to this undertaking.Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful story written by Tim Burton where misinterpretations and errors lead to admirable traits such as courage, forgiveness, and love.  However, the story is told in a macabre environment where characteristics are most often forgotten.  Despite the ghoulish atmosphere there is always a need for love and affection, and this punches through the true need for these traits.  Henry Selick does a very good job as he directs this puppet feature as it offers many thoughts and ideas for an audience to ponder, which leaves them with a very good cinematic experience.	4.0	Puppet film with ghoulish atmosphere and valuable lessons...	2004-04-25	3	3	0

A recent trip to WDW at Halloween ignited my interest in this movie again, and I believe it is one of the best films Disney ever made. The sets are incredibly detailed, each character is an individual, the voices are fantastic and the plot is very original. More than anything-I love the music. Danny Elfman not only wrote the score, but is also the singing voice for The Pumpkin King himself-Jack Skellington.There are plenty of special features on the DVD. I enjoyed hearing the poem that Tim Burton wrote after seeing window displays switched from Halloween to Christmas, the basis for the Nightmare Before Christmas. There is also ""behind the scenes"" footage (from almost 20 years ago now) that shows the sets, the heads for the different characters and the intricate way each scene had to be set up and filmed.While I had a hard time watching it as a kid-there is nothing ridiculously scary or inappropriate about this film. There are very few good family Halloween films out there. When the time comes-I hope to watch this with my kids every Halloween as a kick-off for the Christmas season.$22.00 Is an excellent price for this DVD/Blu-Ray, I haven't found anything close in any store."	5.0	Wouldn't you like to see something strange?	2012-01-25	0	0	0

You would think that Disney would at least include the extras that were on the Laserdisc version that has yet to be relased on DVD... NOPE!  The 3D version of NBC is also CROPPED at a ration of 1:85:1 and was filmed in a resolution that is LOWER THAN the 1080P 2D version. Those that purchased the blu ray, like me, may want to pass on this unless they are just buying it because they just have to have this movie in 3D.  I've seen the 3D version of the Nightmare Before Christmas in the theaters a couple of times and as much as I LOVE NBC, I didn't think that the 3D effects enhanced it that much.  The 3D Jack in the Box at the very beginning of the film was the best 3D effect of the entire movie.  After that, the 3D effects were retrofitted and mediocre at best. If you want all the editions of this classic and didn't already purchase it in Blu Ray than go for it if your wallet will allow. However, Disney CANNOT entice me to purchase this movie a third time in 3D with NO additional features than the previous edition.	2.0	Hefty Price tag for a LOWER RES CROPPED 3D Version	2011-06-16	25	12	13
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A29P4G7LWGMNIA	Kirsten H Neely	I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and this year I decided to share it with my boyfriend, who had never seen it...and to remind myself of why I love it so much.I must admit up front that I'm a fan of plot-driven musicals with great scores, Halloween is my favorite holiday, and Tim Burton movies with Danny Elfman music are pretty much my thing.  My boyfriend is also very open-minded and has an eclectic array of music and movies that he likes, so there's that.That said, I was smiling and singing from the opening credits and the Halloween song...such masterful music and clever stop-action animation.  Every character is interesting, funny, and/or carefully crafted.  Halfway through the film, my boyfriend said &#34;Why have I never seen this?&#34; and proceeded to make up lyrics to the &#34;What's This?&#34; song for about a week afterwards.  Definitely a must-see for kids-at-heart, but maybe not for kids under 6 or 7 who get nightmares easily, as it's a bit scary in parts where (for example) a girl gets her scarecrow-like arm pulled off by a maniacal mad scientist, Santa Claus is chained up by the Boogie Man, and scary toys are released upon unsuspecting kids.  If they can handle that stuff to get to the happy ending, they'll love it too.	5.0	Charming, silly, spooky classic enjoyed by a long-time fan and a brand-new one	2013-12-28	0	0	0

Although it's never lacking in entertainment or originality, it does owe a lot to the silent German expressionist films (especially &quot;The Cabinet of Dr.  Caligari&quot;).  That being said I can only applaud Burton and his crew  for daring to be different in this world of cookie cutter animation.  If  you look at the other reviews you'll find that they managed to offend a few  of the viewers.  Well I find that's usually true of a great film, and this  is in every respect a great film.	5.0	A film buff's must see	1999-06-29	1	0	1

Such is the case with 'NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS'. It's artistic merits as well as Burton's conceptual genius, dark comedic settings, characters and situations, create an absolutely enchanting tale of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King and his vision of ghoulish Christmas.  This is the finest as well as the best stop-motion animation film of all-time in my opinion. It draws elements from classics such as &quot;Mad Monster Party&quot; and &quot;Rudolph, the Red Nosed Riendeer&quot; and advances those techniques times 1 Million.Burton creates a magical story, the comical other world of the Holidays, a technical wonder, a masterpiece, and a work of art!	5.0	&quot;NIGHTMARE&quot; a veritable work of genius, MASTERPIECE	2000-11-08	2	2	0

Carter ""Castlebreaker"""	I love &quot;Nightmare&quot; - it's one of my all-time favorite animated films - but I have to admit that to me, the best thing on this DVD is Burton's early short film, &quot;Vincent&quot;.  The animation is very similiar to that of &quot;Nightmare&quot; and you can see early reflections of Jack and Sally in Vincent's imaginary world.  But the best part of this 5-1/2 minute short is hearing Burton's hero, Vincent Price, once more.  He reads this charming poem about 7-year-old Vincent Malloy's longing to be &quot;just like Vincent Price&quot; and the smothered glee in his voice as he tells how the child delightedly dreams of dipping his aunt in wax for his wax museum brought a huge smile to my face.  There was only once Vincent Price and fans can get a little time with him here.Of course, the DVD's focal point is &quot;Nightmare&quot; itself, which shines.  I went to see this repeatedly when it originally came out in theatres, so delighted was I with the story and the character of Jack (and the three vampires - watch for the scene where they play ice hockey - the original puck they used was a model of Burton's head but it got replaced by a pumpkin).  Oogie Boogie's character is still a bit shallow to me - I never have quite gotten his &quot;motivation&quot; - but that doesn't matter.  The entire film is still great!And there is still that great moment when the parents ask one kid, &quot;Well, what did Santa [Jack Skellington] bring you?&quot; and the kid pulls out ... oh, well, watch the DVD.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3K8AJ5N5JN4FD	Lee	Even though mine was authentic dvd released by Buena Vista Home Entertainment and it was truly region 1 but I am having some difficulties to access the set up menu for audio and subtitle. Sometimes the menu for set up did not appeared to the screen and I have to press 'play' or jump to scene to get the DTS track sound. I am also having problem to access the bonus material esspecially to access to Tim Burton's early movie such as Vincent and Frankenweenie. I have to try hard and few times to make sure it appear. By minusing 1 star for this dvd edition, I think is fair enough because of the problems on disc. However the movie absolutely amazing and hopefully Buena Vista will re-release it after fix up all the problems or for Blu Ray and I have no doubt to buy it again!	4.0	Set Up And Bonus Material Menu Problem!	2007-11-13	0	0	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3VYDLL7WN5ZCM	Lee	The Nightmare Before Christmas is truly a wonderful film... Incredible stop-motion animation, oustanding production design and great musical numbers. The film itself easily deserves 5 stars, and the DVD has great extras including a very interesting commentary track and two of Tim Burton's early short films.Just be warned, however, that this Special Edition DVD features a non-anamorphic DVD transfer. Those of you with regular 4x3 TVs won't be affected by this but if you have a widescreen TV, the quality drops significantly. The sound is top-notch and the colours are vibrant, but with regards to the video quality, I just hope that Buena Vista will give this film the anamorphic DVD treatment it deserves someday.	4.0	Fantastic film, non-anamorphic DVD...	2005-07-24	1	1	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3NYZB4V55CZIM	Liz	"When Nightmare was originally released, it was released through Disney's Touchstone Pictures banner. As director Henry Selick recalls, ""Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project, was they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming.""That certainly wasn't the case and this time around Disney has decided to adopt it's ""step-child project"". This, however, comes with a couple nice ""Disney Perks"" as I will call them.AND THE DISNEY PERKS ARE...1. Should I ever damage the DVD or break it, Disney has a replacement program in which you can replace your DVD through them for $6.95 - this is a pretty good deal and it applies to ALL Disney films.2. My DVD did not come with an activation code for digital copy. Rather than having to go through Amazon to return it, I called the 1-800 number on the DVD and Disney will not only replace my copy free of charge despite it being used, but they are going to pay the shipping both ways.As for the Special Edition, there are some great features. The bonus disc contains substantial features, the digital copy makes putting the movie on my digital devices a breeze, and the DVD itself comes equipped with a ""fast-play"" feature. This is a great buy for fans of the movie - but don't wait on it, Disney has a habit of cutting us off by placing their movies back in their demand-creating Vault."	4.0	"Disney has decided to adopt it's ""step-child project"""	2008-10-16	2	1	1

There were quite a few scenes that just seemed like they were meant to be in 3D all along. Don't expect object to come flying out of the screen at you. This is a 2D to 3D post-conversion after all, but the 3D effect excels at creating depth which draws you in and immerses you into Tim Burton's crazy world. The puppets looked like you could literally reach into the screen and touch them. I highly recommend checking this film out.

"Tim Burton (Big Fish, Edward Scissorhands, Planet of The Apes, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory) came up with the orginal story for this clever film. His imagination is amazing.This film was actually directed by Henry Selick (James and The Giant Peach, Monkeybone)who gave the agles and sequences a great deal of life, charm and magnetism.The story is about the man in charge of Halloween Jack Skellington (Voiced by Chris Sarandon - Fright Night, The Princess Bride) who decides to want to try and take over the Christmas Holiday.Once he realizes what Christmas is all about he discovers that he got it all wrong. With the help of his friend Sally ( Voiced by the talented Cathrine O'Hara - Best In Show, Dick Tracey, Home Alone), he realizes his mistake just when Oogie Boogie (Voiced by Ken Page - All Dogs Go To Heaven, Torch Song Trilogy) threatens to get rid of Sally and Santa Clause himself (Voiced by Ed Ivory - Eye on the Sparrow - and he is also the SINGING voice for Oogie Boogie))You can also hear the talents of Paul Rubens (Pee Wee Herman) as well as William Hickey and Glenn Shadix (Planet of the Apes, Multiplicity).The music is by the incredible Danny Elfman (Chicago, Men In Black, Edward Scissorhands, Hulk, Spider-Man, Planet Of The Apes) who also does the SINGING voice for Jack Skelington. Incredible writing, lyrics and performance by him. He really is a true talent. My favorite is ""What's This?""The DVD extra's are incredible.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1B2QHIQOQ5GLB	LoS Fam	I loved this movie since it first came out and enjoyed the ride at Disneyland years ago. I shared this movie with my children through Netflix and they fell in love with it as well, so I purchased them a DVD copy from Amazon. The DVD arrived in a sealed condition, I am assuming I received a new copy, and it arrived within the time frame given. My kids were so happy to open the package and see this movie inside. A great gift for any one who enjoys this unorthodox holiday classic.As far as content, it looks like it would be scary for children but our children love this movie. They might be different as they enjoy Tim Burton films. I think the only questionable part is with Oogy Boogy with Santa Clause. There is mild amputation (Sally disconnecting her arms and legs and Jack throwing his rib for Zero) but no blood, guts, or sexually explicted images. The language is clean and don't recall any questionable words.	5.0	A favorite for our family	2012-05-03	1	0	1

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2SDOJG10YNYE	L Smith	"Nightmare Before Christmas [Blu-ray]Since there are a number of reviews listed on previous releases of this movie which describe the storyline of The Nightmare Before Christmas, I will just mention that I saw it when it was originally released in the movie theaters and have been a fan ever since. After being unable to find out sufficient details about the technical specs of this 2010 release on the Amazon and Disney websites, I decided to find out the information by visiting a ""Big Box"" store so that I could physically look at the Blu-ray/DVD cover. This version contains one Blu-ray disk and one DVD disk. The Blu-ray specs listed on the box are 1080p, with a 1:66:1 aspect ratio. The DVD specs are shown as ""original theatrical format"" with a 1:66:1 aspect ratio. If you do not already own a Blu-ray player, this version will work best.After considering this information, I decided to order the Blu-ray + Digital (2008 release) from Amazon since I did not have any use for another standard DVD in my collection, and the Blu-ray disk has the same aspect ratio of 1:66:1.The Nightmare Before Christmas [Blu-ray] + Digital CopyThe picture quality on this Blu-ray shows a vast improvement over the DVD Special Edition released in 2000.For anyone who is a fan of this movie and is considering purchasing a Blu-ray version, I would tell them that it is definitely worth the upgrade."	4.0	Nightmare Before Christmas 2 Disk (Blu-ray + DVD)	2010-10-16	80	73	7

I thought it was an ""all right"" movie, albeit somewhat boring. A skeleton learns about Christmas for the first time and tries to write himself into the traditions of the holiday by taking Santa Claus's place and having him kidnapped. Personally I think that Christmas and Halloween are two holidays that never should be merged together. If this happens, Halloween robs Christmas of its magic and glory and replaces it with fear and monsters. I do not like Christmas specials of this genre, and I also dislike ones that take modern spins on timeless customs. It just robs the holiday of its whimsy."	3.0	Two Things that Shouldn't Be Merged	2012-06-26	9	0	9

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3L0D4C92N0JMW	Lyndsi	I love Christmas more than pretty much anything in the world, and Halloween/fall shortly after.  I'm a Christmas purist and saw this movie for the first time at age 19, in June I think, and was unimpressed.  A year later I picked it back up around Halloween and then it hit me.  It had been so long since I was a kid and I had grown so removed from the magic feeling of the season, but when Jack, the King of Halloween, discovers Christmastown, it all comes back.  Seeing someone from a completely outside perspective discover the magic and happiness of Christmas really makes me appreciate the season all the more, and I can recapture the feeling of being a kid at Christmastime.  Besides that, the animation is absolutely spectacular.  I know others have seen it once and then never again, like myself, but if you are a fan of Christmas, I urge you to watch it again.As a side note, as I purchased this from Amazon's online video service, I've really appreciated being able to watch this movie from pretty much anywhere--my work computer, home computer, anyone else's computer, my Kindle.	5.0	Brings back the magic of Christmas.	2012-08-21	1	1	0

I can't help it, I wish that I could live in the Town of Halloween where every day of the year focuses on creating new fiendish delights for the big show at the end of October.  I also found that I could really relate to the ennui felt by the main character when he yearned for something new.  His delight at discovering the new sights and sounds of Christmas, and his subsequent effort to capture some Christmas magic for himself and his friends is both funny and touching.I highly recommend for children and grown people alike.	5.0	Holiday classic for Goths and deviants alike	2013-06-12	1	1	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AHMZEN51O7GS7	M. A. Devlin	"I am not a big Tim Burton fan, but this movie is in my top 3 of alltime. Perhaps the fact that Halloween is my favorite holiday influencedmy opinion, but I doubt it. The more I hear and read about this movie,the more I love it.Based on a parody of the famous ""Night before Christmas"" poem by Moorethat Burton wrote and illustrated while employed at Disney, this ideawas stagnant for many years prior to filming. In many ways this was agood thing, technology was able to catch up to Burton's ideas.In NBC, we see our hero Jack Skellington, aka The Pumpkin King,depressed as another Halloween passes. In the background we hear theresidents of Halloween Town celebrate another wonderful holiday. ButJack is sad. The only one who notices is the Rag Doll-style womanSally.Other characters, including many town-monsters, are introduced. We meetthe wonderful mayor with two faces, the evil scientist and hisassistant, three local children and our evil boogie-man.After an accident, Jack develops a plan to kidnap ""Sandy Claws"" andgive presents out for Christmas in place of Christmas Town. You willhave to view this movie to discover the rest.The claymation is not what I expected, it was of a high quality and themovements are not jerky like the old Christmas Specials. Danny Elfman'smusic has little resemblance to his work with Ongo Bongo and ""What'sthis?"" (which Jack sings when he discovers the colorful world ofChristmas Town) is closer to a tune mixed from Cabaret and The MusicMan. The voices match the mouth movements nearly perfectly. This was aproject from the heart and all the little touches to make it 'just'right show this fact."	5.0	A true must see for all Halloween fans	2004-12-12	0	0	0

It's a great movie to watch on Halloween or Christmas and is definitely a great all around family film.  Like most Tim Burton films, some of the characters may be a bit creepy to some very small children, but it shouldn't be too much to handle.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q	"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;"""	This comparison would never have occurred to my had I not turned on my radio to a short bit on an opening musical the night after watching The Nightmare Before Christmas, but Danny Elfman's scoring for this 'operetta' is more than a little reminiscent of the music one popular in the Yiddish Opera style.  For northern European Jews who had come from life in the shtetls (little towns) this music was comfort food and I thing that Nightmare owes more than a little of its attractiveness to fond memories of the klezmer style.  Your experience, of course, may differ.At any rate, the story does indeed take place in a shtetl, although this tiny town is really Halloween Town, and the residents could never be mistaken for anything else than the charming monsters that they are.  Led by Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, Halloween Town is wrapping up its annual party of horrors and poor Jack is discovering that Halloween has somehow lost its meaning for home.  Torn by his own dismal feelings he walks through the night until, by an accident of fate, he stumbles on another town full of joyful elves and decorated trees - you guessed it - Christmas Town.Suddenly Jack is overwhelmed by the new feelings that Christmas seems to awaken in him.  In a burst of envy Jack determines that this year Halloween Town will do Christmas in its own unique fashion.  All the townsfolk join in Jack's merry plot except for rag doll Sally whose unrequited love for Skellington tells her that kidnapping Father Christmas is a potential disaster.All of this is done in delightful musical style with an animation style that is part old and part new.  A feast for eye, ear, and even heart.  The story is simple but meaningful, as Jack discovers that Christmas is not about anything that you can touch or feel.  And that there is a time to be terrible and, yes, a time to love as well.	5.0	Zero The Red Nosed Ghost Dog	2005-04-15	36	23	13
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A267NGV80I78F5	Marcus Thein	I guess from a value proposition, this pack seems worth getting regardless if you own a 3DTV or not.  Amazon still has the original Blu-Ray 2-Disc pack listed at $24, so paying 7 extra to include a 3D version is alright I guess.  Especially in my case, I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I've NEVER watched this movie and it's only just recently that I've finally jumped on the HD bandwagon, so this movie's Blu-Ray re-release is pretty good timing.Review Update:Please bear in mind that I made the review back when the combo pack was CONSIDERABLY cheaper than what it's going for now.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A18A8JTD719KM9	Margarita	This is one of the best movies ever made, in my opinion.  There have been many copycats but this is the only one with heart.  I love most of the characters and they all have such distinct personalities that it's difficult not to feel for them.  Jack, of course, could be just about any one of us with out dissatisfaction amidst luxury.  Sally is what I admire in a woman:  strong, clever, protective, and secure.  She doesn't shy away from sewing and cooking and looking pretty but she is really the star of the show because she encompasses all that makes a woman separate-but-equal to a man.  She is what feminists should be promoting to girls but, alas, they choose different role models who need a sword to get what she wants.  The message is unmistakeable and even fairly young children will get it.  Adults will see much of themselves in the characters and there are quite a few jokes that will go over the heads of the kids that are very funny for the adults.  This movie does a great job of satisfying the young ones while those of us who have lived for a few decades are able to see what we wish we had done with out lives and are still able to do in our future.  This is a must see for everyone, really.	5.0	Totally my favorite!	2013-01-02	0	0	0

It has a look like no other and it certainly reflects the skill of the crafstmen that made the whole thing. Just a magical, inventive movie that enjoy so much. The songs aren't half bad, probably because they are kept shorter than a traditional disney feature.Anyway, I really don't like many of Burton's films. They all emphasize visuals over story. Since most of the visuals are the same in all his other movies, they become boring. This is by far the most entertaining of  Burton's films and in my opinion the best.	5.0	Great	2000-10-22	0	0	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	In a time long forgotten, various towns were responsible for giving our holidays their cheer.  One such place was Halloweentown.  Jack Skellington (voiced by Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon) was Pumpkin King and the reason the holiday was always so successful.However, he was bored with his job.  One day, he stumbled upon the entrance to Christmastown and was immediately captured by the happiness and good feelings he produced.  He immediately decided that this year, he would run the holiday himself with the help of his Halloweentown cronies.  Only Sally (Catherine O'Hara) seems to think this is a bad idea.  Will Jack be able to pull it off?I must confess, I've only seen this movie twice, and I haven't exactly gone out of my way to see it either time.  I did enjoy it more the second time around.  This is a twisty holiday tale that I think is more suited for Halloween than Christmas.  And I think one reason I enjoyed it more was watching it this time of year instead of later.  And I better appreciated many of the great gags as the residents of Halloweentown prepared for the holiday.The movie is over half music, with the songs having been written by Danny Elfman.  While I wouldn't call most of the songs catchy, they are amusing and certainly keep the story moving forward.Two problems seem to plague the movie, at least for me.  One is the fact that it is stop motion animation.  As bit an animation fan as I am, I have never quite gotten into it.  This form seems stilted to me, keeping me from truly getting involved in the film.  Which leads to the second problem.  While the story moves forward nicely, I never truly feel like we get to know the characters.While Disney may have released it, this movie certainly isn't for young kids.  Some of the images are downright scary.  Older kids and adults will enjoy the humor and jokes scattered throughout the piece, however.This isn't your normal holiday movie.  But it just might be growing on me.  I certainly enjoyed it more the second time around than I did the first.	4.0	"""How Horrible Our Christmas Will Be."""	2009-10-29	3	2	1

The plot here is (spoliers not included thank God) Halloween Town's greatest hero is Jack Skellengton but he has just grown tired of the same old thing...I won't tell how he gets there but he somehow stumbles into Christmas Town singing the unforgattble song &quot;What's This&quot;. The fellow members of Halloween Town kidnap &quot;Sandy Claws&quot; and give him to Oogy Boogy. The songs are extremly well done and though out. But the only sane person in Halloween Town is Sandy who loves Jack but he dosen't know yet. The animation is fluid and bouncy and the dialouge is very witty and genius.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AXQ8T2D9IT6UG	"M. B. Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa..."	"This movie, directed by Henry Selick and written by Tim Burton, is absolutely delightful. I recommend it for children, teens and adults with lots of imagination, who believe they are prepared to watch a different and sensibly darker take on Christmas.The main premise is that, whether we know it or not, all holidays are planned in advance in diverse special towns. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" takes place in one of those towns, Halloweentown, that is the place where Halloween is planned each year. Te main responsible of that planning is Jack Skellington, also called the King of Halloween. However, not many know that Jack is bored to death of always doing the same thing. Jack knows he is missing something, but has no idea whatsoever of what that is. Of course, everything changes when Jack discovers Christmastown, the town where (of course) Christmas is planned. For Jack, Christmas is something totally new, and foreign. All the same, he falls in love with it, and has a ""brilliant"" idea: to kidnap Santa Claus, and to hijack Christmas.Needless to say, things don't go smoothly, but that is a big part of the fun of watching this movie. Confusions abound when Jack and all his friends of Halloweentown try to plan Christmas for the very first time, and the result is extremely entertaining. That is specially true if you are bored of classic Christmas films that end up saying the same things all over again. This is certainly not the case in this animated film :)All in all, I think you are highly likely to enjoy this movie. Notwithstanding that, I don't recommend ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" for young children, due to the fact that some of the scenes might scare them a little. Having said that, I think that this film is a treat you are going to enjoy, and thus I highly recommend it...Belen Alcat"	5.0	"A ""brilliant"" idea:  to hijack Christmas."	2005-10-02	4	3	1

It gives a really funky look into the world of holidays, with a separate universe for each holiday that is connected to the real world. One day, Jack Skellington becomes curious about the other worlds, and goes from the Halloween world to the world of Christmas, where he is intrigued by it because it is so different from his own, so he wants to celebrate Christmas in the mortal world. This brings about disastrous consequences because he does not quite understand Christmas, and the other residents of the Halloween world understand it even less. The results are scary and hilarious, and this is a classic movie that never gets old.	5.0	Funky look at the holidays	2011-09-30	0	0	0

Floore ""barrito42"""	I would prefer to give this three and a half stars.This is a beautiful movie and has been one of my favorites since I first saw it. Tim Burton is a genius, and knows how to bring out this dark, surrealistic beauty in all of his works. Burton's imagination of the lands where holidays come from (if you've not wondered, I'd say it's time you begun)  is brilliant, with Jack as the king of Halloween. I'm glad Burton didn't choose something tacky like Jack'o'Lantern, or Mr. Unlucky, or any of those typical named beings associated with Halloween. Creating a new being only added to the movie. A few of the lines are corny, and some of the delivery seems strange, but that happens in most movies.As for the VHS, I found all the additional stuff they put on it to be silly. Save it for the DVD; I understand that they were trying to make that information to be more accessible, but I hate fast forwarding through the movie jsut to get to the interesting info. Most other movies save it for the DVD... they could have too.	4.0	Excellent movie, bad VHS	2001-01-04	4	0	4

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A16XRPF40679KG	Michael Dobey	This is a holiday classic that is fun for the whole family. The 2d blu ray is perhaps better than the 3d version but it is included with this package so you can see it that way too.  The 3d version is blown up to a different ratio than the 2d version. Does this crop the picture? I don't know. But this is a dark movie and was not shot in 3d. It was re-released in 3d though. So you get that version here. The 3d is more for depth in this one than anything else. However I thought the picture looked as good as the 2d version. If you can afford this package then get it. It has lots of extras on the 2d disc. However like alot of movies converted to 3d it's not spectacular , it's still a good watch though and worth the upgrade if affordable to you.  This is one of tim burtons best for sure. It includes several short features like 'frankenweenie' (which is now been made into a full fledged movie) and others.  I have 58 3d blu rays and this is as good as most of them.	5.0	classic looks good in 3d.	2012-07-19	1	1	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2DLW47JXRLUTP	"Michael D. Sepesy ""egaeus"""	I saw this film when it was originally released and didn't like it then, mostly because it is done in an irritating operatic with music by the overrated Danny Elfman. Watching it 20 years later only confirmed my original opinion. I know people who really like this movie, and that my opinion here will have little effect; but I would like to go on record in asserting that this film is not entertaining.I don't object to musicals necessarily. I have seen very good ones. One of the problems with music, however, is that it doesn't get to the point very quickly and makes scenes that much longer. Characters state their subtext; every utterance seems like a prolonged speech. Scenes that should take 2 minutes take 5. That's the case with this movie: too many long musical monologues in which very little interest is created because characters say exactly what they think. Characters are more interesting when their motivations are not in your face the entire time.Additionally, it seems that the film attempts to be funny at times but fails, in part because of the slow pace and in part because the majority of the &#34;gags&#34; just aren't very good..I have given the film two stars instead of one because visually, it sets up its own world and has a kind of beauty...but that doesn't necessarily make it a watchable movie.	2.0	Great animation; lousy movie	2014-01-10	2	0	2

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AZI0O32W4ZYGH	"Michael Gordon ""Michael Gordon"""	The Nightmare Before Christmas is original in every sense of the word.  The story line--Halloween creatures taking over the holiday of Christmas--has, from what I know, never been carried out before.  Jack Skellington is the lead character who attempts to take over Christmas.  The irony of this story is that the lead villian turns out to also be a hero.  That, again, is a display of sheer brilliance and creativity.  And it is true -- almost everyone in our modern era loathes musicals.  I do too.  But there is something quite masterful and creative about the way it is presented in this film.Although the movie is 10 years old, it will likely be quite timeless.  There is nothing about the story that indicates the time period.  The graphics are still of very high quality -- to the point that it is somewhat like &quot;eye candy.&quot;  I was mesmorized by the graphics.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A38ZTUNQJVGP6S	Michael Patrick Boyd	"The Nightmare Before Christmas is one hour and sixteen minutes and was released in theaters on October 15, 1993. The movie was initially to be released through Disney Studios, but the powers that be though that Nightmare was and I quote ""too dark and scary for kids"". Jack Skellington, The Pumpkin King, has just finished another Halloween and is depressed because it is the same old scare year after year; though the residents of Halloween Town enjoy it very much. Jack is looking for that something in his life and goes wondering off into the woods and find the holiday trees of Valentine Day, Easter, Saint Patrick Day, Thanksgiving, Halloween and Christmas. Each tree is a portal to that town and he accidently opens the Christmas Tree's portal door and gets sucked into Christmas Town. Jack is amazed at what he sees in Christmas Town; Christmas Town is the exact opposite of Halloween Town. In Christmas Town everybody is happy, building toys, and the smell of pie is everywhere. When Jack comes back to Halloween town and calls a town meeting, he tries to explain Christmas to the resident but the residents just cannot grasp it.Jack heads home and stays lock up in his lab trying to use a scientific approach to understand Christmas as well as performing experiments. Finally Jack is able to solve the problem about Christmas and announce to the residents of Halloween Town, who are witches, ghosts, vampires, zombies and bunch of other scary residents, that Christmas is ours this year. The only thing wrong with this picture is that the people who live in Halloween Town have live a life of scaring, doing creepy things, and being evil. They are unable to grasp the goodness of Christmas, but they do their best to try. The sleigh that Jack drives is coffin shaped and is pulled\flown by three skeleton reindeers; just to give you and example. Jack sends Lock, Shock and Barrel to snatch Santa Claus and bring him to Halloween Town. The three are able to find Santa Claus and hand him over to Oogie Boogie who begins to taunt him. Meanwhile Jack, along with his ghost dog Zero, flies off into the night sky with his bag of scary toys to hand out to the children of the world.Jack plans backfires when the parents inform the police of the phony Santa Clause and Jack's sleigh and reindeers are shot down from the sky. Jack realizes what he has done and head back to Halloween Town to rescue Santa Clause and set everything straight. Jack discovers that Santa Claus is held captive by Oogie Boogie and that Oogie Boogie is about to kill Santa Claus and Sally. Jack is able to rescue Santa Clause and Sally and defeats Oogie Boogie. In the end Santa Claus is able to restore Christmas and out the end of the movie it begins to snow and the residents begin to sing their version of What's This. Not since Mad Monster Party came out in 1967 has there been a stop motion picture been made; though I could be wrong.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AW99SBGWEXP0J	Michael Zuffa	"In Halloween Town, October 31 is the biggest night of the year.  Jack Skellington (Sarandon & Elfman), organizer of the festivities has got the blues.  He wants something different in his life, and while wandering in the forest, he finds a door to Christmas Town.  In Christmas Town, things are bright and cheerful.  It captures his interest, and when he returns to Halloween Town, he announces that this year, they will celebrate Christmas.  In fact, Jack will even replace ""Sandy Claws"" on Christmas to help spread the cheer.  He has it all planned out, but Salle (O'Hara) has a premonition that things will go terribly wrong.""Nightmare"" has developed a following since it's initial release in 1993.  The stop-motion animation as well as the melding of Halloween and Christmas has captivated many, and Disney's decision to release it in 3-D is a welcome event for those people.  I think even a regular re-release would drum up some excitement.  The animation is top notch, and the story idea is an interesting one, but for me the execution of the story falls a little flat.  That being said, ""Nightmare"" is still worth seeing, especially in 3-D."	4.0	The Nightmare Before Christmas 3-D	2006-11-02	4	2	2

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"Tim Burton is not the first person that comes to mind when you think of children's entertainment but he has a closer connection with that film genre then most would think. Tim Burton attended the California Institute of the Arts, also known as ""Mickey Mouse University for its ties to Disney animation, and later worked for the Walt Disney Company on such animated films as The Fox and the House and The Black Cauldron early in his entertainment career. It wasn't until his work on short films like Vincent and Frankenweenie that his directing talent was fully recognized. Burton went on to work on such favorites as Beetlejuice, Batman, and Edward Scissorhands but found time to write a poem entitled ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which became the inspiration for this feature. Being unable to direct the project due to his commitment to Batman Returns, Burton choose Henry Selick while both decided that stop motion was the best medium to bring Halloweentown to life. But would Burton's twisted take on the favorite ""Night Before Christmas"" tale be accepted by the general public or would it be too weird even for the hardcore Burton fans?The story centers on the exploits of the pumpkin king of Halloweentown as he tries to spread his own bit of Christmas cheer. Jack Skellington lives in the area known as Halloweentown where scary monsters and ghouls live year around always preparing for next Halloween. But Jack has lost the spark of excitement he once had for the holiday and falls into deep seclusion. Upon stumbling onto a secret door that leads to Christmastown, the home of Santa and his elves, Jack finds a new calling in life. Why should Christmas be restricted to Christmastown? Why can't everybody be allowed to celebrate this joyous holiday? So with this in mind the pumpkin king decides to give old Saint Nick a vacation and helms the sleigh spreading joy to all girls and boys. But when his plan backfires, it is up to Jack to save Christmas. The story of The Nightmare Before Christmas is pretty good despite several plot holes. Why does it take Lock, Jock, and Barrel almost a month to capture Santa Clause when it only took them less then a day to capture the Easter Bunny? Why is the military brought in to stop a Santa imposter? Granted the film is not to be taken seriously but there are some things that are just too over the top.Since the Nightmare Before Christmas is presented mostly in song (ten songs total in the one hour and sixteen minute feature), perhaps it is better to discuss about each character rather then the voices behind them. Jack Skellington is a perfect lovable yet confused character. A character that only wants to do good things but those good actions come off as being bad to others outside of Halloweentown. One can sympathize with Jack over his feelings of depression and seclusion over the lack of excitement he once had for his calling in life. More then a few people who see this can relate to this character more then once their lives. Jack's love interest, Sally, is another interesting and perplexing character. For most of her life she has dreamt of going out into the world and escape the seclusion her creator, the doctor, has kept her in. The ironic situation is that when she does go into the world, she sends herself into seclusion and isolation when she is the only one who does follow along with Jack's plans. The only character that seems to be a problem for the film is Oogie Boogie. We really don't learn that much about the character as he isn't featured that much in the film and he doesn't really do anything outside of creating slight tension for the plot.Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas, despite several problems, is still a decent effort. The stop motion animated special effects of Nightmare are still pretty impressive but were probably more impressive at the time it was released. The film's effects fail to hold up like traditional animated films and the feature really shows its age in a couple of scenes. Though the film is intended for children and is not to be taken too seriously, there are several moments where the creators are asking too much believability from the audience especially a scene where the military gets involved in shooting down the Santa imposter. With the idea that this is a children's film in mind, why are there so many moments in the film that would probably scare the living Hell out of a four or five year old? The feature tries to be children friendly but as soon as it attempts to it slips right back into the dark and scary moments again. Either this film is intended for children or for adults; it would be a lot more consistent if the filmmakers made up their minds. Outside of those problems, the amazing songs by Danny Elfman (including Jack's Lament) and several beautiful sets make the film worth at least one viewing. Nightmare Before Christmas is a decent experiment that, despite showing some age, can still delight certain audiences."	4.0	The Moose Hole - 'Nightmare' a Pretty Decent Vision	2003-12-31	6	3	3

She's the mover and shaker, I follow.  One would think that this movie was right up our alley.Pretty much from start to finish we both were drop-jawed aghast at this movie.  Not that there weren't a few good bits so maybe this review deserved two stars, not one. (good bits: the two-faced mayor, the naughty kids bringing back the poor (spoiler deleted, sorry!) instead of Sandy Claws...)I don't want to rant; I have several friends who love this movie and our neighbor bought the collector's edition for my son as a Christmas present since we're so into Halloween.In terms of technicalities, I thought that the music and singing was fine; I personally enjoy stop motion animation albiet my wife really dislikes any video entertainment that is too visually unbelievable (e.g. older Doctor Who in addition to most animated features).  I don't have any real opinion on the DVD menu features and special features; we put the disc in and it played without error.  :-)  I'm not a huge Oingo Boingo fan like some I know but I enjoy Danny Elfman's music both just as music and also in the context of movie soundtracks.But really the story is unbelievably bad.  It's far too childish for adult viewing and it's far too malice-filled for a younger audience.  Santa's kindness and generosity was, in the end, the only redeeming factor for this movie.  The only lesson learned by Jack (the protagonist) was to be happy with whatever lot life has given you.  I would have liked some form of enlightenment or betterment over the course of the story.I just really do not see the context in which this can be seen as a great story.  The mechanics, voices and music are great.  There were moments when even though I was still filled with horror, I chuckled at a gag or two but wow what an unwatchable movie.  I really hope that my son decides not to watch his present again.  Ever.  I will leave the room.	1.0	Did we all see the same movie?	2009-02-05	48	5	43

If you have a blu ray player and like the film I'd say it is worth it to double dip, with those colors popping off the screen at 1080p or hearing kidnap the sandy claws and Danny Elfman's score (Good Will Hunting (Miramax Collector's Series)) in the newer sound formats (if your lucky enough to have them).BLU RAY FEATURES (FROM MOVIEWEB)You can watch a Tim Burton classic in 1080p for the first time this August.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2XRZV63X79YSJ	"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector"""	"Everyone thinks that this is a Tim Burton film but he did not direct it.  The film is based on poem that Burton wrote and he produced the film.This film takes place where every holiday has a ""Land"". Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon / Danny Elfman) is the king of Halloween Land.  Another brilliant Halloween is over and Jack is bored with Halloween.  Jack wanders the forest and finds the entrance to the other ""Towns"".  He is drawn to the bright and shiny door of Christmas Town.  He is sucked into the portal and what he sees amazes him.  He is dazzled by the Christmas lights and snow.  And Jack decides to take over Christmas.Christmas Eve arrives and Jack takes over for Santa and delivers the presents made by Halloween Town.  Unfortunately, they are more appropriate for Halloween than Christmas.Sally (Catherine O'Hara) is the servant to the evil scientist (William Hickey) but she has a fascination with Jack.  When Oogie Boogie (Ken Paige) decides to take over Halloween Town, Sally comes to Jack's rescue.In the end everything works out.The story is well thought out and the dialogue is witty.  The production design and character design are outstanding.  They create the atmosphere of the movie.  Add to this a brilliant score by Danny Elfman.  This creates one of the best stop animation movies.DVD EXTRAS:Commentary by director Henry Selick and cinematographer Pete KozachikMaking of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas - A 25 minute making of featurette with Burton, Selick, co producer Kathleen Gavin, Danny Elfman, storyboard supervisor Joseph Ranft, supervising animator Eric Leighton, art director Deane Taylor, set designer Gregg Olsson, cinematographer Pete Kozachik, motion control camera operator Dave Hanks, sculptor Greg Dykstra, animator Mike Belzer, armature engineer Blair Clark, character fabrication supervisor Bonita DeCarlo, animator Anthony Scott and track reader Dave Mason.  As you can see this is not your ordinary making of featurette, you get a full understanding of the stop motion animation process.Storyboard to Film Comparison -  A four minute comparison that has a storyboard on top and the scene below.Deleted Scenes: Deleted Storyboards described by Henry Selick - Three deleted storyboards that were never animated totaling 3 minutes with reason why they were not pursued.Deleted Scenes: Deleted Animated Sequences described by Henry Selick - Four deleted scenes totaling 5 minutes with reason why they were cut or edited.  I like when there is commentary so we know why it was cut.The Worlds of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas - This takes you behind the scenes in Halloween Town, Christmas Town and the Real World.  This shows character design, concept art and sometimes animation tests.  Usually I don't care about these extras but this is a unique film and this is a unique look at the creative process that you need to see.Tim Burton's Early Films: Vincent - A 6 minute stop animation short narrated by Vincent Price.  It's a cute parody on Vincent Price's movies.Tim Burton's Early Films: Frankenweenie - A 30 minute parody of the Frankenstein tales with a boy and his dog that was run over by a car starring Shelly Duvall, Daniel Stern and Barret Oliver.The extras are exceptional to go with an exceptional film."	5.0	Movie A- Extras A+	2006-01-14	2	1	1

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	ALSDJP35S1DB4	"Mr. King ""Lit/Comp 9A"""	"by Harrison Merritt.In Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Jack Skellington, The Pumpkin King of Halloween, yearns for nothing more than abreath of fresh air, something new, instead of the same old, boring Halloween. As he wanders through the forest he visits a land of white with green trees and glowing lights, something he has never seen before, something wonderful. Jack Skellington will have Christmas this year, instead of the ubiquitous Halloween.This story presents some of the most human complications composed of our most primal emotions of love, lust, and the unrelentingurge for something new, which is what makes this story so engrossing. Not to mention the time consuming, but well-worth-it ""stop-motion"" animation. The settings and songs were groundbreaking.The Nightmare Before Christmas has so much to offer, if you can get past the creepy overtones. I'd suggest it to anyone."	5.0	The Nightmare Before Christmas	2005-10-23	0	0	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1ER6IYOMM8VCT	"! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK"""	"This movie is a visual treat! Tim Burton can certainly come up with all the visual elements in a film, but he lacks in his story telling sometimes. The music in this film is mediocre at best and is one of it's biggest flaws. Please don't get me wrong, I love this movie, but it is not one of the greatest movie ever made as many have claimed. The music is boring and drags sometimes especially if you copmpare it to 'James and the Giant Peach' where the songs are very good and drive the film. ""James"" is much more entertaining on a story level too. 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is a beautiful looking film and has great characters, it also has fantastic animation and who doesn't love monsters?, but it just doesn't quite live up to the cult status it has achieved."	4.0	GREAT DVD AND MOVIE  ....BUT	2007-03-31	6	1	5

I went through 100 reviews and only 4 or 5 people disliked the movie, so that should be a testiment to its quality. Granted, some people may think it too morbid for young children, but I have a 6 year-old brother who has wathed it with us for several years and he's never been frightened. Also, the myth about this being a ""goth"" movie it not quite true. I'm not goth, and I have a friend who is as far from goth as one can be and she LOVES this movie. The basic point of The Nightmare Before Christmas is the Pumpkin King, Jack Skellington who is a skeleton (duh) grows bored of is job as boss of Halloween and accidentily finds Christmas Town. When he returns from his adventure he tries to explain this holiday to the citizens of Halloween who don't really get it. Jack decides to take over Christmas and disasterous results follow. This is a musical so there is obviously music and singing (which is exceptoinal). There is a little bit of romance, and a little bit of comedy, something about this that makes it a classic in my opinion. I reccomend it for anyone or Tim Burton fans especially."	5.0	The BEST!!!	2006-01-21	2	0	2

The claymation is original, and fascinating for the eyes.  The songs are catchy, and the storyline is as well.  The characters are unforgettable.  Jack, Sally, and the rest of the gang are perhaps some of film's most unique and original characters.  Tim Burton is a mastermind, who has delivered a flawless movie.  It respectably can be considered a timeless classic.  I recommend this movie to anyone who admires Burton's other works.	5.0	A masterpiece!	2004-01-02	0	0	0

This movie is not your messiah.  Billy from Good Charlotte is not a god because he has Jack and Sally tattoos.  Get over it and grow up.....with that said.....The Nightmare Before Christmas is a beautiful movie.  Tim Burton outdid himself with the creation of these characters who reach out and touch the audiences souls much more than most movies starring live actors.  Danny Elfman's soundtrack is by far the best movie score I've ever heard.  His compositions flow perfectly with the the tone of the movie, and they help to tell the story even better, something only one other musical (South Park:Bigger, Longer, and Uncut) has ever been able to do.This movie is such a joy for Halloween, Christmas, or the year round.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AZ2K08MNJFR16	"N. Chiemelu ""movie slave"""	As an animated feature, Christmas movie, musical, goth fantasy, this movie delivers!  Danny Elfman and Tim Burton should just get married or have their brains fused together or something because whatever they touch together is genius.The Nightmare Before Christmas is an irreverant take on Christmas stories and the imagery and characters as well as music and themes are so wonderful and fitting.  And for a skeleton, Jack the Pumpkin King is hot!  It's an amazing and incredibly underappreciated movie that seriously needs to be rereleased on the big screen for Christmas so that kids who were too young to watch it (it might be a bit scary for kids under the age of 6 or 7) before can see what they've missed out on and anyone older who appreciates a good story and is tired of the same old Christmas crap (Jim Carrey's cinematic rape of the Dr. Seuss classic Grinch, the pathetically clunky Polar Express, etc.) needs to see it too.This movie is on my Top 10 list of the Best Christmas Movies of All Time.	5.0	One of the Best Modern Christmas Movies of all Time!	2004-11-25	4	3	1
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	Since this film was released ten years ago, it still garners acclaim the world over, and justifiably it should.  Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is a true feast for the senses, from the atmosphere to the state of the art stop motion animation, this film is pure joy from beginning to end.  The story revolves around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloweentown who soon tires of his day in, day out Halloween themed shenanigans.  When he stumbles upon Christmastown, he plans to bring his own version of Christmas to everyone by impersonating a kidnapped Santa Claus.  While the film is aimed at a young audience, teens and adults will eat up everything that is presented here.  And even though some of the film may be too macabre for it's own good towards young children, The Nightmare Before Christmas is still a rousing film that actually will satisfy the entire family.  This Special Edition DVD presents the film with a fantastic DTS track, and includes a number of extras including two short films from Tim Burton.	5.0	A masterpiece	2003-11-01	1	1	0

Yeah, he&#8217;s made some other really great movies too.  But I can&#8217;t think of a single one that has maintained the longevity and popularity of this one.  The story is completely unique and imaginative, and the animation is (at least &#8220;was&#8221;) completely one of a kind in style and quality.  Now, this might be a PG movie, but I&#8217;d put it towards the upper-end of PG.The 3-D is pretty decent as well, and was nice to add to the collection of 3-D titles, but the main reason for the purchase was simply for the standard Blu-Ray, which looks and sounds incredible.I was a little shocked by the price tag (for the 20th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray 3D, Blu-Ray, DVD, & Digital Copy), but it is rather popular, and there are a lot of different formats being offered in one package.All-in-all, well worth the money.  Whether you&#8217;re an old fan looking to upgrade the copy you already have, buying it for the first time, or completely new to it and interested in checking out, you will not be disappointed.	5.0	Possibly the greatest Halloween movie ever made.	2014-06-27	0	0	0

No idea if it is because I was born two months after this movie came out or because I love Halloween but this movie is my number one favorite. Right away you fall in love with Jack and Sally and the rest of the other characters as well. And see that this is not only about Halloween or Christmas or staying who you are but also about seeing the person who loves you for you right in front of you. Not only for children, or teenagers this movie is even great for adults. I am a huge fan and this is my wedding theme for good reasons because it is easy to follow and fall in love with.

The high definition is great for this film because it lets you see the detail of the models so much better.It's also our first experience with the digital copy feature, which I like because the kids can run the movie on the PC without having to fire up the home theatre or handle the disk.My interest in Danny Elfman's music predates his film scoring career, so I found it fascinating how he worked with Tim Burton to get the songs written before a script actually existed.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AQBHNE9AP6YBP	NostalgiaVHS	The early 90's was a great time for film and animation, especially for Walt Disney Studios, who were experiencing a renaissance in terms of quality and popularity. Another giant at the time was Tim Burton, a star director who directed both the Batman films as well as Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands. Tim Burton has a unique vision and an ability to materialize his colorful personality better than most other film makers are cable of. From the very beginning, the idea of Tim Burton and Disney collaborating on a stop-motion animation film and its a match made in heaven. Add score master Danny Elfman to write the music, and you've got history in the making!The film opens with a brilliant song called 'This is Halloween', that establishes the setting and many of the major characters as they prepare to celebrate their yearly ritual of Halloween. They live in Halloweentown, so Halloween is kind of a big deal for them. They all go bananas when their pumpkin master Jack Skelington rolls onto the scene sporting a flaming pumpkin. He gives a spectacular show and everybody loves him, but in classic Disney style our hero is riddled with inner turmoil, longing for something new instead of the same ritual year by year. He wanders off and discovers a new holiday, Christmas! Jack falls in love with the jolly spirit of Christmas as a contradiction to his normal life and attempts to make the next Christmas the best one ever, though it doesn't exactly go the way he plans.The film is filled with catchy and memorable songs that will definitely tempt you to sing along (even in a crowded theater). Some of my personal favorite tracks from the movie are 'Jack's Lament', the town meeting song, and 'Making Christmas'. The songs are so memorable and iconic that there even exists a tribute album entirely dedicated to them, and it's pretty good too! Although it doesn't hold a candle to the originals by Danny Elfman, that man is a genius.Stop-motion animation was an excellent choice because it gives the film a very unique, life-like look. The animators put many man-hours into making the film frame-by-frame, and their dedication shows in the attention to detail. The amount of detail and care given to smooth out the movements really makes everything look a lot more realistic than most traditionally animated films. Tim Burton's twisted and dark imagination comes to life in the most fantastic of ways in Halloweentown, populated by a whole bunch of weird and wacky monsters who are honestly more lovable than scary (until they bite your face off).There is a lot of humor in this movie, which I really appreciate because it helps keep things interesting. One of the most hilarious characters in the movie is the Mayor, who switches between his confident face and nervous face to wacky results. Another favorite of mine is the Oogey Boogey Man. That guy used to crack me up as a kid. I have to admit, though, his ending part really used to freak me out.I've seen this movie three times in movie theaters when it was rereleased in 3d. It has remained a favorite of mine since I was a little kid and had it on VHS. For some reason it became a trendy, hot topic sort of thing and got super popular, but to me its not a fashion trend its a great animated movie!	5.0	One of The Most Iconic Films of My Childhood!	2013-03-17	1	1	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A9MO1WIGT7ICT	"NotoriousSEG ""reviewer at large"""	Whether you are into Halloween, Christmas, or just good entertainment, this film is a must see.  The story follows the exploits of Halloweentown's most prominant citizen, Jack Skellington, as he searches within and without to become self actualized.  No longer satisfied with  the pedestrian hoopla that surrounds his holiday, Jack sets out to conquor Christmas and finds that the grass is not always greener on the other side.Plot aside, this film with its obvious nod to the German Expressionist movement, is a feast for the eyes.  Its twisted perspective and dark, brooding sets appeal to my morose side, yet the overall atmosphere remains fun and humorous.  The production values are a veritible tour de force of the stop-motion animator's art and Danny Elfman's soundtrack is nothing less than a modern masterpiece!You don't have to be a lonely, disenfranchised, &quot;goth&quot; teenager to appreciate the look of this film --it has something for everyone.  Some characters might be a tad too gruesome for impressionable little eyes, however.  I'd save this treat for the post-diaper set.The Nightmare Before Christmas is destined to become a holiday classic in the tradition of the Great Pumpkin or Rudolph.	5.0	Delightfully Dark &amp; Mirthfully Macabre	2003-08-24	1	1	0

It's an ingenious story that I still watch happily several times a year (since it came out).It's the story of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, who's started to get tired of the same old Halloween every year. Then he discovers Christmastown! Excited by the new prospects, he tells everyone in Halloweentown about this wonderous holiday, and the citizens decide to try it themselves! It's up to a rag doll named Sally to save Santa- and save Christmas- from the Oogie Boogie.The characters are hilarious and riveting- you can't help but fall in love with them, even the minor ones! Lock, Shock, and Barrel are the best. :) The movie is a musical, with the songs written (and mostly sung) by Danny Elfman. The music's great, but the lyrics are a little iffy sometimes (but still fun to sing along to!) The film was made with stop action, which gives it that jerky-yet-smooth charm.The best parts are the songs &quot;This Is Halloween&quot;, &quot;Making Christmas&quot;, and &quot;Town Meeting Song&quot;. The doctor is one of the more interesting characters.I highly recommend this movie to... well, just about anyone! It's not scary (trust me, I've been watching since I was 5!) or anything like that... just a big bundle of fun!

I do love Henry Sellick and I think his 'Coraline' is the BEST stop motion out there.  The nightmare before xmas is too creepy for me, just plain morbid.  In my humble opinion, one can tell this movie is 20 years old.  The 3D is not bad, but not spectacular either.	1.0	creepy in a bad way, old OLD movie made 20 years ago	2013-11-19	13	2	11

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2TYAL88IXRSEV	Peter Prainito	Call me crazy, but I already own this Tim Burton masterpiece on VHS, DVD, and the soundtrack on CD. Seldom would I ever consider buying a movie a  third time, but I love this film so much that I am going to shell out the  bucks again! Why? First of all, this movie is so good that it has already  become a classic. The story can be enjoyed anytime, but especially at  Halloween and Christmas. The story combines elements of both holidays ever  so cleverly. Simply, the message of the story is be a first-rate yourself  rather than a third-rate somebody else. Jack Skelington, the pumpkin king  of Halloween gets &quot;weary of the same old thing&quot; and tries his  hand at taking over Christmas from Santa (&quot;Sandy Claws&quot; as he  calls him). The results of his efforts are both hilarious and touching. The  music by Danny Elfman is outstanding and perfectly complements the story.  You'll be singing the tunes to yourself. Oh yes, the other reason I'm  buying &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; again is because this  edition will contain extra &quot;behind the scenes stuff&quot; that I love,  which was not made available on my current DVD. This is one of those rare  gems that I can recommend buying, even if you've never seen it before.  Finally, during the last 10 years there have been many wonderful animated  films made. Among my favorites are: &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;,  &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, &quot;Toy Story I &amp; II&quot;,  &quot;Antz&quot;, &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;, and &quot;The Nightmare Before  Christmas&quot;. All of these masterpieces will appeal to all ages.	5.0	I Love this film so much, I'm buying it a third time!	2000-08-24	41	29	12

My son said that he wished he could jump into the TV (because he wants to be in the movie too). I guess it could be scary for some kids, but my kids have never been scared of things like ghosts, etc. We've always insisted that it's pretend and that there's nothing to be scared of so they aren't under the impression that they have anything to be afraid of. This is one of the only movies I've bought for my kids because I rented it and they kept wanting to watch it over and over.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2XAKGRUHIE2ZA	"P. Stein ""Bengals Fan"""	Update on this movie.  Because of the negative comments posted to my original review, I decided to watch the movie again, on Showtime, in HD-Big screen.  I thought that maybe I missed something.  My opinion has not changed.  I think it's an absolutely terrible movie, and I was a little too generous giving it a second star.  By the way, in this class of movie, I like Coraline the best.Original review:  I watched this via streaming.  The detail was outstanding.  The problem was that as much as I liked Corpse Bride, I disliked this movie.  In Corpse Bride, the characters seemed genuine, and I really sympathized with the two brides.  Loved the dog.  In Nightmare, all the characters were shallow, not developed, and not lovable at all.  Even the dog failed to give me any emotion. Totally bored throughout.  Waited for it to get better, and it never did.  Corpse Bride gave us a detestable evil character, and a surprise ending, Nightmare gave us neither.	2.0	Very dissapointing after Corpse Bride.	2009-10-14	5	1	4

I do love the 'This is HALLOWEEN' song, and the revamped version done by Marilyn Manson. It's awesome that they combine HALLOWEEN and Christmas. In case you are new to the world of Tim Burton's depressing gothic/emo films, I'll give a brief synopsis; Jack Skellington is the King of HALLOWEEN Town, and he is getting tired of it. After the HALLOWEEN bash, he accidentally stumbles into Christmas Town and wants to bring it all back to his world. The creatures of HALLOWEEN Town begin to help Jack with his dream. Will Jack's dream go the way he plans? Can he save Santa Claus from Oogie Boogie.

When I was just 4 years old, I would visit my best friend.  Almost every time, we would watch this movie.  I loved it.  A few years ago, I decided to watch it again for the first time in years, since I was very young.  All I had to hear were the very first notes of the superb musical score and I experienced the most powerful feeling of nostalgia I've ever known.  The movie is beautifully dark (that is why it's often considered ""goth""), but also lighthearted, so it reminded me of some of my happiest childhood memories all at once.  I've grown up with musical rhythmic intelligence, and I believe it is because of this movie.  I guess I'm just trying to say that just because the company with the rights is sort of milking every bit  of cash they can out of this wonderful film, and because many of the people who buy the merchandise are supposedly ""goth"", don't avoid this gem.  It's absolutely magical for children."	5.0	Will always be my favorite...	2006-02-12	2	1	1

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	APTF85TZUXVME	"Quentin Xavier ""QX"""	This movie has somthing for everyone. It is fantastic. It has music, dark comedy, wonderful visuals, a great score, bizarre chracters, and lots of imagination. This is by far one of the most imaginative films made in the last ten years. Tim Burton's ideas, along with Henry Selick's direction, and Danny Elfman' score, this movie became one of the best animated films ever made. Only Tim Burton could create something that is so equally chilling and childlike. the film may be too scary for very young children, but for kids seven on through ninety-seven, this is a treat for your senses. The extras are wonderful as well. Vincent is Tim Burton's directorial debut and it is fascinationg to see the influence of his work on this film. Like I said, only Tim can do this kind of work. His genius is equal parts David Lynch and Dr. Seuss. Disturbing and charming. He is a brilliant mind and this movie offers a rare showcase of that creativity. One of my all-time favorites and a pleasure from start to finish.	5.0	Wonderful, beautiful film is appropriate for all ages	2001-11-05	5	3	2

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A5ZUZ49YRDPCV	Rachel Garret	Tim Burton's hilarious, artistic dark comedy &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; is entirely filmed in claymation and released in 1991. It is now on DVD and as good as it was when it was first released. Tim Burton's magic is present in every scene. The dark comedy is set to the haunting, beautiful music of Danny Elfman, who has collaborated with Tim Burton before (Edward Scissorhands). Tim Burton's comedic take on Christmas, with a macabre twist, and memorable characters, makes this a very timeless classic.The story is about Jack Skeleton, a skeletal resident of Halloween Town who accidentally stumbles into Christmas Town. Here, he abducts Santa Claus and decides that this year, Christmas will be very different. Taking up Santa's role, he readies reindeer (his dog) and brings uncommon gifts to children.  For example, he sends them decapitated heads and ghoulish creations that are more suited to Halloween. The laughs and situations are all very apt, well written and the claymation very incredible.This is a must have for fans of Tim Burton, for fans of great animated or claymated comedy. The DVD has new features, such as new scenes, and other enhancements that make this experience all the more exciting and artistic.	5.0	Enjoyable Holiday Dark Comedy	2003-04-11	2	2	0

Of course, I'd never seen the movie.  But all my friends kept pushing me to see it, and finally I rented it.Wow. By far the best Disney movie of all time, best stop-motion...  Maybe the best movie I've ever seen.  The songs are constantly (including this very second) stuck in my head, and the storyline was great too.  This is defenitely not your average, cheesy ""saving Christmas"" movie.So yeah, now I wear N.B.C. merchandise, but that's because I love the movie, not the products or the trend.  It's true that Hot Topic does have an annoying habit of introducing stupid trends to wannabe- Goths and punks, but most people who wear NBC actually have seen and love the movie.

Biggest one I can tell so far is that in the first 5 minutes there are lyrics missing from the ""This is Halloween"" song. When Sally is combing her hair its supposed to say "" I am the wind blowing through your hair, I am the Who when you call Who's there"" in my set (this one) its missing. There are also some smaller things missing here and there, but I haven't had time to sit down and write a full compairison. That was the first thing I noticed.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A37R1TV112K8PB	"""raspberry-swirl"""	The NightMare Before Christmas! My very favourite film. So what is it that makes the movie so incredible? Well first and foremost, it's visual beauty! This movie was filmed using a technique called stop animation - a technique that requires immense eye for detail and painstaking skill. The animators on this movie went all out to make sure this technique was used to it's full capacity - and the result is - perfect animation!! Such exsquisite attention to detail and some beautiful sets and angles make for many stunning shots as well. Secondly - it's story! That of the inhabitants of Hallowe'en Town deciding to take over Christmas for a year. The only problem is - THEIR idea of expressing love and spreading joy is frightening someone into a stroke - to their way of thinking giving out presents and decorating things with color is just weird, so Christmas is suitably warped to suit their esoteric tastes!!The result is ghoulishly funny, providing you like that kind of humour. =D  Thirdly - the characters. An ecclectic collection of freaks, ghouls, witches, devil and skeletons each perfectly content within their little lives. One of the best things about NBC is the pure innocence of these characters and they warp Christmas - they truly believe they are improving the holiday - for what better way to show someone you care than by slipping a scorpion into their shoe? They have total faith in themselves and in their leader - the indomitable Jack Skellington. One of the things I love most about Jack is his refusal to give up - even when he realises he has ruined Christmas, he doesn't let it get him down - he just picks himself back up and tries to correct his mistakes.The ever sweet Sally - a rag doll who is stitched up at the joint and can stitch and unstitch herself back up - is a bizarrely gentle heroine. She of all the characters in Halloween Town has an idea that affection can be expressed in other ways than presenting your beloved with a severed head.She is also intelligent - she knows it is wrong for Jack to take over Christmas - and brave. Oogy Boogy Man, a swinging-jazz bad guy, Lock, Shock and Barrel and the Harlequin Demon are among my other favourite characters.I guess the characters follow what I call &quot;The Addams Family Syndrome&quot;. That family adores one another and their friends and family, and will do anything for them, but at the same time they are, by society's standards, very bizaare. They do what most consider to be weird, and even at times, cruel things to each other - but they think they are doing the right thing. They have eternal faith in themselves and are bound by very strong feelings.It never occurs to them they might be evil.And they're not - they don't betray anyone, they don't corrupt anyone and they try to set a good example for their children, and everyone is welcome in their home. The characters of Halloween are very similar to that.Finally,the music! Written by the brilliant Danny Elfman (who seems at his best when he teams with Tim Burton, who conceieved and produced this flick) the songs are witty,playful and very memorable.Some have a definite touch of the macabre,(Kidnap the Sandy Claws) some are intensely sweet (Sally's Song), some have definite malice to them (Oogy Boogy's Song) and some express the wonderment and general good nature of the inhabitants of Halloween Town (Making Christmas,Jack's Obsession, What's This?). All are cool! =DNBC is just generally fantastic film for people of all ages! Whether you appreciate it's cinematic beauty,the story it tells or just everything in general, it's well worth the look!	5.0	I sense there's something in the wind...a fantastic film	2000-12-12	9	9	0

I of course will buy this set when it is released in a few weeks to go with my 1993 version I already own, but what I would really like to see is a release of the movie in 3-D format with a few pairs of glasses included (spykids). I'm sure there are plenty of fanatics out there that wouldn't mind paying the extra cost for it.  I know I'd pay.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AHGHQ5SPYZ60Q	"R. Byrd ""byrdie"""	So, for the holidays, I decided to buy some of my favorite seasonal films, and &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; was on my list.  I like eye-candy, and thus I like Tim Burton.  But I'm not reviewing the film so much as this version of it.  This is a special, widescreen edition that includes:  an original trailer,  a &quot;making of&quot;, &quot;Vincent,&quot; narrated by Vincent Price, and  &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;.What it *doesn't* include, however, is the ending I saw in the theater.  This version ends with the song near a pumpkin patch (as I clumsily try not to spoil the film for anyone who hasn't already seen it), and not the closing narration.  Okay, so I'm picky.  I thought I was getting the entire film, and I didn't.  The closing narration wasn't long or even, to my mind, boring.  Granted, it probably wasn't necessary either, but then, how was including &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; necessary?It's a wonderful movie and a really cool edition considering what all you get in it.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3AO6ILR65IVAD	Rebecca	I have recently done my own stop motion animation film, and I saw this again recently since doing it and, thought I had seen it like hundreds of times before, I was so blown away now that I understood how hard it is! Especially that one part where he sings that song 'poor jack' and his clothes are all torn up and swing back and forth OMG that is hard, like, somebody animated that frame by frame and it must have taken sooo long. And its got this awesome pan through the whole thing, that whole scene has these great sweeping camera movements and that is really difficult to do, they had to get like these robotic cameras that moved frame by frame (no joke, watch the making of)!!!! This movie is such a landmark and I show it to everyone who hasn't seen it. The DVD is great because it has lots of special features and making ofs. If you haven't seen this movie then you are a POOR DEPRIVED SOUL!!!! Also the music is so great I am obsessed with Danny Elfman he is so cool.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1L98GYVERQZXB	Rebekah L. Sprecher	I went to see this movie when I was already a Danny Elfman and Tim Burton fan, but I soon became a fan of the entire film.  It is a beautifully crafted, well-thought-out tale of Jack Skellington and the people of his  Halloween town who decide to take over Christmas.  The Elfman fan that I  am, I must note that the music is especially haunting (play on words  intended) and beautiful -- my favorite being &quot;Sally's Song&quot;.  Some of the characters (the man with the tear-away face comes to mind) may  be too scary for little kids, but my 4 year old has seen it (what a thrill  it is for me to share this movie with him!) and enjoyed it without being  scared.  It's one of my all-time favorites and will remain in my top-shelf  video collection evermore!	5.0	Highly entertaining take on the spirit of Christmas	1999-12-15	17	13	4

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"With the advent of video/DVD, certain movies lend themselves to annual viewing during specific holiday seasons, especially Halloween (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown""), Thanksgiving (""Home for the Holidays""), and of course, The Big One, Christmas (Insert your own favorites here); specific films that for whatever reason manifest the spirit of their respective times of the year, and they generally match up one season per film.  Filmmaker Tim Burton, however, has the distinction of having created a singular film to add to this category, unique in that it is suited equally to both Halloween AND Christmas.  And it tops the entire list of the titles of which that can be said; in fact, it IS the list-- there simply are no others.  Burton's brainchild, which had a gestation period of many years before at last being realized in 1993 is, indeed, in a category of it's own.  It is, of course, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" directed by Henry Selick.Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, can put the scare on like no one else.  But after years of doing what he does best-- scaring the wits out of children of all ages, everywhere, every Halloween-- he's bored; depressed, even.  There's just no ""rush"" in it for him anymore.  So, after a particularly unfulfilling Allhallow's Eve, Jack wanders off alone into the night to contemplate his circumstance and his future, whereupon he inadvertently stumbles into ""Christmas Town,"" and discovers something new (""What's this?  What's this!"")-- a different holiday, as well as the celebration that accompanies it.  Most importantly, though, he also discovers his counterpart, the one who is to this holiday what he is to Halloween.  ""And they call... him... San-Dee CLAWS!""  And Jack, his eyes and ears filled with the sights and sounds of Christmas, is more excited than he's been in a long, long while.  He doesn't know, yet, what all of this is about, but he's going to find out; and he's already made up his mind:  Whatever it is, it's going to be his!  Sandee Claws, step aside-- Jack Skellington is here!Through the magic of stop-motion animation, Burton's vision-- his story and the characters who populate his ""nightmare""-- comes vividly to life, the process of which is guided along nicely by director Selick.  And what a bunch of characters there are!  Besides Jack (who is, without question, the star of the show), there is the two-faced (literally) Mayor (Glenn Shadix); Dr. Finklestein (wonderfully voiced by William Hickey); Lock, Shock and Barrel (Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, Danny Elfman), the unholy trio who work for the dreadful Mr. Oogie Boogie (Ken Page); and, last but not least, gentle and compassionate Sally (Catherine O'Hara), who cares for Jack and so badly wants to help him find whatever it is he's looking for.  Intriguing characters for a highly original story, imaginatively drawn and presented with care and an expertise that really makes this one work.Another element that sells it is the engaging score and original songs by Danny Elfman (who also supplies Jack's singing voice).  And Selick uses the music wisely to create an appropriate atmosphere and mood conducive to the storyline.  The songs, especially, are haunting, hypnotic, upbeat and theatrical, and combined with the magic of the splendid visual content, helps set the tone for a rich and thoroughly entertaining experience.The supporting cast includes (the voices of) Ed Ivory (Santa), Susan McBride (Big Witch), Debi Durst (Corpse Kid/Corpse Mother/Small Witch), Greg Proops (Harlequin Demon/Devil/Sax Player), Kerry Katz (Man Under Stairs/Vampire/Corpse Father), Randy Crenshaw (Mr. Hyde/Behemoth/Vampire), Sherwood Ball (Mummy/ Vampire), Carmen Twillie (Undersea Gal/Man Under the Stairs) and Glenn Waters (Wolfman).  There's a decidedly dark side to this film that may be disturbing to younger viewers, but for those to whom the monster-in-the-closet no longer appears, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is good for TWO of your favorite holidays (or actually, for any time of the year, for that matter).  Unique, to say the least, this is a fun foray into fantasy that can be enjoyed time and again.  The story, the characters, the images, the songs; it's all magic.  It is, in fact, the magic of the movies.  Tim Burton style."	5.0	A Unique Experience	2002-01-21	6	6	0

For the environmentally conscious, you'll be happy to know that the DVD and Digital Copy are combined into the same disc, so less plastic! As for the 3D version of this movie, I wasn't that impressed. The most impressive scene was toward the end when it snows in Halloweentown. The snow jumps right out of the screen and really has that ""cool factor"" but then it goes away in the next scene. The majority of the scenes has very minor 3D effects. For the occasional novelty of it, watch the 3D. But for the majority of the time I watch this movie, I'll stick with the 2D Blu-ray. If the entire movie jumped out of the screen, similar to the snow scene, then the 3D would be more worth it."	4.0	A great movie that packs every way to watch it	2013-08-07	1	1	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A4FX5YCJA630V	"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya"""	"What's the Halloween movie that also gets everyone excited for Christmas? Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" of course, which even goes so far as to throw in a dash of Easter as well. Having long-since been established as a holiday classic, there's a good chance that anyone reading this review has already watched the film countless times, so let me try and tell you something you *don't* know about it...Contrary to the name on the poster, Tim Burton did not direct ""Nightmare"" nor even write the screenplay. The task of directing went to Henry Selick (who would go on to direct the brilliantCoraline) whilst Caroline Thompson wrote the script. Burton's contribution was a sketch-book full of quirky character designs and a basic idea inspired by the holiday TV specialsRudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeerand Doctor Suess'sHow the Grinch Stole Christmas.In fact, ""Nightmare"" can best be described as an amalgamation of the two: combining the stop-motion animation of Rudolph with an inverted Grinch as the story's protagonist. As it turns out, Jack Skellington doesn't want to destroy Christmas because he hates it. He LOVES Christmas, so much so that he nearly ruins it in his attempts to hi-jack it for himself.The residents of Halloween Town - witches, ghouls, goblins and many more - all come together on Halloween night in order to enjoy getting thoroughly spooked. Leading the celebrations is Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, but lately he's been feeling rather melancholy. It turns out that he's tired of the same old routine and is on the lookout for something new and fresh. After a long walk in the forest he comes across a strange portal that leads him to a place called Christmas Town. Instantly delighted by the colour and magic it provides, he resolves to introduce it to the townsfolk back home.They're eager enough to get on board with Jack's new passion, despite the reservations of the down-to-earth rag doll Sally, but simply replicating the holiday isn't enough for Jack. Nothing else will do but that he seize control of Christmas and take the role of Santa Claus (or ""Sandy Claws"" as he's mistakingly called) for himself. As you can imagine this doesn't go well, especially not for Santa, left to the mercy of the horrid Bogeyman...There is a timelessness to stop-motion animation that spares it from ever looking old or dated (unlike some of the earliest computer animated films), and twenty years on ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" still looks as gorgeous and grotesque as ever. For the style and atmosphere of the film, the creators turned to the etched pencilled quality found in the works of Edward Gorey and Charles Addams, rending Halloween Town a creepy yet beautiful place, complete with a colour palette of black, white and orange.Also worth noting is Danny Elfman, composer and long-time collaborator with Burton (in fact, he's provided the scores for most of his feature films). The musical numbers are integral to the storytelling process, each one catchy and memorable, and Elfman even provides the singing voice for Jack.The imaginative force behind the creation of the film results in a number of iconic characters, from the spidery Jack Skellington to the stitched-up rag-doll Sally, as well as the distinctive residents of Halloween Town: from the (literally) two-faced Mayor to Jack's ghostly dog Zero. Even Santa gets in on the action, portrayed as a no-nonsense harbinger of joy and good tidings, who nevertheless won't stand for his own kidnapping.It seems strange to think that when the film was first released back in 1993, Disney decided to release it under Touchstone Pictures, deeming it too scary for small children. Since becoming a massive hit, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has since been fully embraced by Disney, going so far as to give it a 3-D conversion and refurnish Disneyland's Haunted Mansion every Halloween with ""Nightmare"" characters. The latest DVD release is full of special features, including deleted scenes, storyboards and behind-the-scenes featurettes, shedding insight on the creative process.Though some of the imagery might be a bit too intense for the *very* young, there's a reason why ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has stood the test of time and is now considered a classic. With the fun subversion of villains and heroes, a protagonist who means well but nearly destroys Christmas for everyone, and a sincere celebration of the holidays, this is one of those films that will be brought out every year to get you in the right mood for Halloween - or Christmas."	5.0	"""This is Halloween!"""	2013-12-01	1	1	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1YSI93GVIVPPT	Robert Fernandez	I've not seen this movie in a very long time, and it wasn't until just recently that I revisited it. The Nightmare Before Christmas' title sounds like something from a horror movie, but it certainly isn't one. Sure, everything looks grim and creepy, but that's just the setting. The story of Jack Skellington feeling as if everything is a routine for him and wants to experience something different was kinda touching, as is with the songs he sings to himself in the film. The music is creepy at times and is beautiful when needed, and it's all composed by Danny Elfman; who in turn also wrote the songs, and does Jack Skellington's voice. TNMBC was skillfully animated, using the stop-motion style, which most likely took them quite a while to finish. The end product looks pretty good too, especially for a movie released back in '91. Tim Burton has always been one of my favorite directors, and this film didn't let me down. Not only did it bring back some nice childhood memories, but it also made me feel good in the process. Those parents who aren't sure of showing this film to their kids because it may scare them, at least consider that the movie has NO violence either than a stitched-up lady jumping from a building, but she doesn't get harmed as she puts herself back together. If your kids can handle the creepy looking monsters and creatures, by all means let them watch this movie. They most likely will never forget it.	5.0	Fantastic, wonderful, and moving...	2003-05-28	5	5	0

As a child, I looked forward to those now clasic animated christmas movies from the 50's and 60's, but I always thought they were a little too  inocent. Nightmare Before Christmas is any childs fantasy brought to life,  as well as an homage to those great films. Frame after frame, Burtin paints  a wonderfully macabre landscape with characters who are spooky as they are  lovable. Add the unforgettable music and songs of Danny Elfman, and you  have a film that will never grow old.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1JUYF5D6TFFHB	"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya"""	"Tim Burton's 90's classic ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" used state-of-the-art stop-motion animation/claymation and told the story of Jack Skellington, a bony skeleton King of Halloween Land who orders the kidnap of Santa Claus from Christmas Land in order that he delivers toys for Christmas for one year. The satire within the story can be appreciated by adults. It seems to criticize the commercialism of Christmas and in its twisted way, it works. It is also the story of Jack Skellington's dreams and he is seen as a kind of hero by the end of the movie. For its time, this movie was innovative. The creations - ghouls, goblis, skeletons, witches, vampires and other Halloween creatures- come to life vividly on screenand appear as human as the rest of us. The songs are very catchy. Who can forget Skellington belting out ""What's this ?"" and the chorus song ""This Is Halloween"". Tim Burton pulls all the stops and this bizarre film is nothing unusual for the bleak style that Burton's films are famous for (Edward Scissor Hands, etc). The only other similar stop-animation film that took Burton years to make is the recently released Corpse Bride, which unfortunately didnt do so well in theaters. It is still a good film but it lacks the depth, characterization and good storytelling that Nightmare has. I hope that when Corpse Bride is released on DVD, there will be mention of Nightmare Before Christmas."	5.0	Tim Burton's Masterpiece Of Animation	2005-10-28	1	1	0

This film is unlike any film I have ever seen.  What I find stunning is that the audience finds passion and feeling coming from two characters made of clay.  It is really a feast for the eyes, and even the ears being that it is a musical.  One of Burton's greatest acheivments, this film I feel is more for the adults than it is for the children.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A38ELS8IRNOCGJ	Samantha Skellington	I absolutly LOVE this movie!!It was created by Tim Burton (awesome)in 1991. Even though Christmas is in the title, it is more like Halloween. It is about Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloweentown, who gets tired of doing Halloween. He accidentally discovers Christmastown and falls in love with it. He decides to take over Christmas but actually makes it like Halloween with presents (which I wish would happen) and everything starts going wrong. Luckily, Sally, the rag doll who loves him, saves him from disaster. It is a musical (my surprise) and they're really good songs! Danny Elfman makes the songs (also did songs from Spiderman and Chicago,the movie)and plays the singing voice of Jack. And besides that, this movie is perfect! The only movie that can compare with it, I think, is Edward Scissorhands (also made by Tim Burton). Thats not very good for young ones though, but The Nightmare Before Christmas is great for kids!

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	ADV3V1ZR99UYN	"Sandy ""alice-in-wonderland"""	Being a slightly strange child all my life at the age of seven or eight I had a real love for things that badly scared others of my age, and likewise, was badly scared by things that others of my age enjoyed. I was truly enchanted at my early age by this movie, quickly developing a love for a slightly psychotic, insanely fun film, one made with true imagination and artistic talent. It was, really, my absolute favourite film until I was about ten--I remember being upstairs, in one of my grandma's spare rooms in her hundreds of years old victorian house, watching The Nightmare Before Christmas in the dead of night. As I got older, I didn't see it again for years. That is, not until this last Halloween.My very delightful friend (as fun and crazy as I am when it comes to anything out of the ordinary) recommended it back to me and I was excited to see it again, remembering how much I loved it when I was little.It was every ounce to my delight, remembering myself years before, hearing this Hard-not-to-sing-with soundtrack and the wonderful characters again after so many years.The story begins as Jack, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town in a land of holidays, is growing tired of 'the same old thing.' He longs for something new besides the screams of the terrified children heard so often at Halloween and the witches, vampires and ghoulish creatures that live in their land. Sally, a stitched girl created by the resident Doctor (Who occasionally open his helmet-like head and gives his grey-pink, wrinkled brain a scratch and transports himself in a self-moving wheelchair), has a hopeless crush upon the greatly adored Jack, and she often tries to escape the clutches of the repressive doctor, who doesn't let her out often. As sad Sally escapes to the cemetary, she find Jack, singing out his laments and sad with the regularity of his life. As forlorn, depressed Jack stumbles through the forest through the night, accompanied by his ghost dog Zero, he reaches strange ring of trees--each with a different symbol upon it with a doorknob. This one a easter egg, this one with a shamrock, this one with a turkey--another with a strange, decorated tree. Entranced, Jack opens the door and falls into the land of Christmas Town, where he declares--&quot;What's this, what's this? There's white things in the air. What's this, there's colours everywhere. What's this? I can't believe my eyes, wake up Jack, this isn't fair! What's this?&quot; Totally delighted by Christmas, Jack is convinced it will fill the empty hole he has felt inside, and, convinced Halloween Town will be just as excited, takes many items back with him to explain Christmas and the mysterious 'Sandy Claws'. What begins is Jack's plan to take over Santa's Christmas job, and hiring The Oogie-Boogey man's three hench-children, the top Trick-or-Treaters of Halloween town, Lock, Shock and Barrel, who kidnap Santa, and makes terrifying toys and a sleigh with a coffin drawn by skeleton reindeer.A delgihtful, different movie experience, Tim Burton's characters are easy to get attached to and though mischevious and creepy, have a loveable quality that is contagious. I'm truly excited to purchase a movie that has been one of my favourites ever since I was a child, and can't wait to watch it again. A truly orignial, singing, chilling but cheerful film that is as timeless as any other, it's a must-see treat! And though it's slightly depressing for the Christmas holiday, it's an absolute must for Halloween.	5.0	What's this, What's this, there's white things in the air...	2002-11-01	1	1	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1K94LXX833JTT	Sanpete	"Hey, you got Halloween on my Christmas! ...  Yes, it's dark Halloween chocolate wrapped around sweet Christmas peanut butter.  Or something like that.The Nightmare Before Christmas isn't your typical Christmas confection, but it is the kind of Christmas movie you might expect from Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands): macabre, sort-of-but-not-too-scary, and ultimately good-humored and good-natured.  It's also quite a feat of animation, the first feature-length stop-action film.  And it's a musical!The story takes place in a world where the magical side of each major holiday is run by a specialized, hidden holiday town, like Santa's North Pole headquarters.  One year, the restless Jack Skellington of Halloween Town discovers Christmas Town, is very impressed, and decides Halloween Town should expand its horizons and take over Christmas that year.  Unfortunately, he and the other residents of his town don't understand Christmas as well as they do Halloween, and their basically well-intentioned efforts threaten to ruin Christmas altogether.The animation is highly imaginative and particularly well suited to the Halloween connections, as we would expect from a Burton-produced project.  The songs, by Danny Elfman, are catchy and fun, partly because of twisted but good-hearted subject matter.  There are scares, adventures, a romance, lessons learned, and a good Christmassy outcome.  Most kids and adults will be delighted, though parents may wish to consider the scary stuff for very young kids who don't like being scared.The Nightmare Before Christmas is coming out in several new editions, all restored and remastered, with new special features.  Besides the Blu-ray on this page, there will also be a new 2-Disc Collector's Edition on standard DVD (here) and, for true fanatics (with the funds), a limited Ultimate Collector's Edition with a numbered, hand-painted bust of Jack Skellington with his Sandy Claws hat and beard and a sound chip that plays quotes from the movie, a letter of authenticity, a special coffin-shaped box for the bust, a booklet with the Nightmare Before Christmas poem, and an extra disc for the digital copy (not sure what the advantage of that is).  That's listed for pre-order at Amazon (here) at roughly ninety bucks more than this edition.  It appears the Ultimate Edition will only be available in standard-definition DVD.I see Mr. Liddell has helpfully posted the press release.  I digested the info a bit and added a few comments for a related review, so I may as well include that here, with apologies for the redundancy.  The new special features are these:-- audio commentary with producer/writer Tim Burton, director Henry Selick and composer Danny Elfman (who also sings in the movie)-- Burton's original ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" poem read by legendary horror actor Christopher Lee-- new intro by Burton for Frankenweenie (see below)-- a digital copy of the movie-- exclusive Blu-ray introduction by Burton-- ""What's This? Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour,"" a two-part promo for the Disneyland theme park attractionFeatures carried over from the 2000 Special Edition:-- ""The Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (about 25 minutes on the Special Edition)-- ""The Worlds of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (the worlds being Halloween Town, Christmas Town, and ""The Real World"")-- deleted scenes (scenes that didn't get past the storyboards and cut animated scenes)-- storyboard to film comparison-- theatrical trailers and posters-- Burton's early short stop-action film Vincent, about a boy who dreams of being Vincent Price, who narrates (5:50)-- uncut version of Frankenweenie, Burton's early short live-action film wherein the basic events of Frankenstein are played out in suburban America, with a young boy in the place of Dr. Frankenstein and a pet dog in the place of the monster (29:50)There's no mention in the press release of the old commentary with Selick and director of photography Pete Kozachik, which went into detail about the technical aspects of the animation.The video will be the original 1.66:1 aspect ratio in 1080p, but the sound specs haven't been announced yet.  There was a teaser for the Blu-ray on the National Treasure 2 Blu-ray DVD.  I haven't seen it, but it reportedly looks great, even better than the excellent old standard DVD."	5.0	The Reese's Peanut Butter Cup of Christmas movies out on Blu-ray August 26th, 2008	2008-06-03	5	2	3
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	ATGDU86NQ356S	"Sape ""Don't need a signature."""	This movie is pleasing to watch. One can easily see the details that went into the characters, the animation, and the background. Plus, the songs are catchy and entertaining. But, who cares? A good movie is only good if its story is good, and this movie's dark, whimsical plot makes it a classic.Nightmare Before Christmas's unique story is about Jack Skellington and his role in Halloween Town, but he is bored with his town's repetitive rituals. He leaves the town to find something new, and he finds it in Christmas Land. Jack is intrigued by this land and plans to take over Christmas this year. Exciting, right? Yes...and no! The tension between Sally and Dr. Finkelstein distracts me from the overall story.Their relationship is disturbing because it represents verbal and mental abuse. Dr. Finkelstein constantly remains Sally that he owns her, and he even locks her in a room, so she doesn't escape his control. Sally hates Dr. Finkelstein and performs extreme tactics to free herself from him. She dislocates her arm, poisons him, and jumps out of a window. There are moments in the movie where I am scared for Sally because I think Dr. Finkelstein is going to hit or kill her.Another problem in the story is Oogie Boogie. He randomly arrives toward the end of the movie and tortures Santa. I don't understand why he does this? I don't even understand his place in Halloween town. How did he become evil? Why did Jack lock him up in that dungeon? It seems like Oogie Boogie is thrown in the story so the audience could have someone to hate. I will admit, I like Oogie's musical number, but he is a cheap character. He needs more development, or he shouldn't be in the story at all.With these two negative aspects sprinkled in the story, this movie is still worth watching...only if you're an adult. If you are a child, I wonder hoe this beautifully wrapped gift of dark situations will affect your well being. I guess only time will tell.	4.0	Innovative and Disturbing	2009-03-15	0	0	0

"For me Tim Burton had been an on & off success - he did an awful job with Planet of the Apes but really soared with Ed Wood.  So renting this movie was with some trepidation.But it's not so!  Henry Selick directed and Burton produced a great stop animation feature, something you don't see much of today, nor in 1993 when it was produced.  With a technical team that took three years to make, the film is really the sum of its parts.  Great film!The story is a simple one with a simple theme.  Jack, the Pumpkin King in Halloween-town has just pulled off another great Halloween complete with vampires that look like Nosferatu and a few horror icons from old films and weird wickedness!  But Jack is bored of the whole thing and wanders around and bumps into doors that lead to holidays - a big heart door for Valentines', an egg-shaped door for Easter.  What's this?  Christmas-town?After much analysis of what makes Christmas, Jack decides to make Christmas in his own Halloween-obsessed image to hilarious results.  A ragdoll girl, recently created, has a crush on Jack and tries to stop him before her premonition comes true and both holidays are lost.favorite scenes:  I like all the wild and crazy characters but especially the Boogey man who rolls those bones (literally) and takes Santa captive.  Another is the mayor of Halloween-town who has a spinning head - one with smiles and one with a fearful frown.  Could this be a metaphor for those who change faces when things don't go well?  Nah!Memorable themes by Danny Elfman!  And a great ""making of"" feature where we meet the director, producers and tech personnel and all the hard work they put into this film.  Quite impressive.Bottom Line:  I had heard a criticism on this film that children would confuse Christmas with Halloween, which is nonsense.  The film is light-hearted, makes fun of itself and has great themes of trying something new and if it doesn't work out, at least you tried!

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3KXUS6ENB5KSI	Scotty D	To review this DVD is a challenge to me. It was an overpriced item to begin with, but I had loved the movie so much in the theatre that I chose a gently used copy to purchase. Here is the part of the review where I remind AMAZON users to check ratings and read reviews of sellers because it was one of the two times in many purchases that I never received the product nor was I refunded any money. Which is my problem with the whole process. Although many dealers are reputable and have a priority of customer service. Some are not and they already have your money. So I gave the 3 star rating only because it was a great movie and I'm imagining that it's out of print because you will be hard pressed to find a decent copy for under thirty dollars.	3.0	why so expensive?	2007-11-23	7	2	5

I really don't care if it's edgy or not.  It's kind of insipid.  The animation and direction are fantastic, and Danny Elfman has ALWAYS done a wonderful job when it comes to scores/soundtracks, but the movie itself is pretty bad.  The plot is silly.  The whole ""be yourself"" message is older than dirt.  The little ""creepy twist"" put on said message is, again, silly.  I honestly do not know why it has such a following.  If anyone would like to tell me, I don't think my email's hidden.

I must have seen this movie 20 times over the years including when it came out in the theater.  Not once did I notice that Zero has a jack-o-lantern for a nose!

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2VKI2PDOT9C9H	S. Hill	I am a huge fan of the Nightmare Before Christmas; however, the 3D effect was not much better than the conversion trick that my tv can do itself, which I think someone else has already said, but I concur. As far as the remastered movie goes, it looks great, I would highly recommend buying it on Blu-ray and you would still get all the special features and everything. At least as of now, I have never seen this 3D Combo-pack very cheap and the 3D just isn't worth it; the 3D is not as good as Lion King 3D, Tangled 3D, any of the Toy Story 3D conversions, or most of the other movies I've seen. Maybe on par with Beauty and the Beast 3D, if even.	4.0	Stick with the regular Blu-ray	2012-04-23	0	0	0

So it wasn't until this Christmas rental deal that I decided to watch it. The beginning to middle was enjoyable. The songs were catchy and simple. The townspeople were all different, quirky, and fun. It wasn't until I finished the movie that I felt ""that's it?"" The plot and decisions of the characters were not at all what I thought or expected which is great for not being predictable but it left me with an ""oh"" feeling. For example when Jack was trying to figure out the meaning Christmas, he has the townspeople prepare gifts for Christmas Town and not his own. Or when he botches Christmas he decides he is a Pumpkin King through and through and decides to stick with what he's good at. I just wasn't expecting the ""stick to your day job"" message. The only change in the people of Halloween Town was their discovery of the wonders of snow. They still didn't understand Christmas. If I'm watching a movie I want to see the protagonist grow a lot more than Jack did. But oh well, that's just me. I know there are millions of people who love this movie dearly (points to the number of 4 and 5 star reviews) but I find the movie to be slightly lacking but still interesting and worth watching for the bits of entertainment it did bring."	3.0	Decent	2010-12-24	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3R8PXSFGY9MC2	Spider Monkey	'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is one of those wonderfully atmospheric films that has easily stood the test of time. It is as delightful and quirky now as when it was initially released. The stop-motion animation is superb and the dark Tim Burton Characters are perfect for the story. Danny Elfman provided the music and songs for this film and they stick in your head at first listen and you can't help but grin and sing along with subsequent viewings. The story is unique and fun and although it has a very dark turn to it, it is still fine viewing for children, although I tend to feel adults may appreciate it more. This is one film I watch annually (yes, at Christmas time!) as a matter of tradition now and I love it every time. A modern classic, and rightly so, and if you haven't seen this film you're missing out on a rare treat.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AZQ6PYDEJQJEF	"Staring Girl ""Staring Girl"""	Words fail me when expressing how much I love this film. It first came out when I was in middle school and I have watched the film countless times since then; each viewing as entrancing as the last. I love this movie not only for it's visuals but also for its incredible music. I am a huge fan of Danny Elfman. Had he just put out an album with music like this without being attached to the movie I would have been happy, however, this incredible music is accompanied by spectacular visuals, ultimately creating an amazing experience.It is obvious to me that Tim Burton is a fan of Edward Gorey; the influence is apparent in his artwork. All of the art in the movie is rather dark, and dreary. The whole movie is stop-motion animation yet the movie takes on an ambiance of being sketched with a pencil. The story is very creative and quit alluring. All the characters in the film are relatable in one way or another. Jack is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. Though he is the King of fright, he longs for more in life, but he doesn't know what will fill that void. Then there is Sally. She longs to be free from her creator and wants to experience life on her own terms. Ultimately Jack discovers that the void he has been feeling is not from lack of fame but from lack of love, which he finds with Sally.As far as the DVD itself, you get wonderful bonuses with it. The production, commentaries, and creating of the movie is very interesting. It's amazing the amount of work, patience, and talent that went into this movie. Then there is the short film Vincent which Tim Burton made years before his breakthrough in the film industry. Though it is only a few minutes long, it's so cute, creative and well done. I just love everything about this DVD; the movie itself plus all the extras.	5.0	Amazing movie plus awesome bonuses from the DVD	2005-05-26	1	1	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3G6IY1YM2NYRQ	"""static2007"""	I love this movie.  I remember back when I was 5 when I first watched it.  The title seems to be misleading to some people, but it isn't really what the title seems to persume.  It's not scary; I was afraid of skellitons when I was little, Jack was the only skelliton I wasn't afraid of.  There's no blood or gore AT ALL in the movie.  It's awsome.  All the characters are awsome and friendly (aside from Oggie Boogie, but that's a givin since he is the villan of the movie).  Awsome music.  Danny Elfman really out-did himself when comming up with the movie.  Awsome storyline.  Tim Burton is a genious.  Original storyline and unforgetable creativity.  There's no violents, but there is action of course.  If you're just cerious about the movie itself, here's a lil' summery.Okay, you got this skelliton in a tux like outfit named Jack.  Now Jack is the Pumpkin King, able to scare anyone out of their wits.  Now being the best and doing the same things over and over again can get boring, so Jack looks for something new.  He ends up finding out about Christmas and loves it to pieces.  He even goes as far as trying to do Christmas himself.  Some things end up getting Santa Claus (funny thing is that Jack always pronouces it 'Sandy Claws') ending up in Oggie Boogies clutches, and Christmas is going all wrong.  I won't revile the end, cuz that always takes the fun out of movies ;) It's a great movie for the whole family.

But younger children like 6 or under may be scared by this movie. The movie's characters break into songs about 5 minutes after finshing a song. Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon and signing voice is done by Danny Elfman) is the town's head pumkin man, but is diappointed when he doesn't get a prize. So he leaves town, and goes to another town named Chirstmastown. Jack goes back to Halloweentown with the idea of Christmas. Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York's Catherine O'Hara voices Sally a creation of an evil scientist (William Hickey). Okay where is Eastertown, Thanksgvingtown, April Fool's Day Town?

The characters and sets are imaginative, well thought out and fully realized especially for fantasy animation.  Danny Elfman's songs are hit show tune  hummable as well as having clever lyrics that add depth and move the plot forward.  Everything in the movie is amazingly and completely detailed making the DVD a joy to watch over and over again.  And of course it is hilariously funny.  It is probably not a great choice for the very young or for anyone easily offended by the unique and unusual but NIGHTMARE is a fantastic Halloween (or any time) choice for everyone else.	5.0	Nice Work Bone Daddy!	2006-10-30	1	1	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3B87UZLPCF0HW	"Tanis ""Tanis Yvonne Somerville"""	Jack Skellington (Sarandon speaking, Elfman singing) is the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown and usually revels in the macabre antics of his fellow townsfolk in the run up to the holiday. This year, however, he's not feeling it. After wandering the forest, he discovers a doorway to Christmasland and, falling in love with the warmth and love there, is determined to bring Christmas to his friends - by kidnapping Santa/Sandy Claus (Ivory). The new version isn't a director's cut: there's no scenes shaved or added, but the 3D makeover adds more depth and gives a wider scope to Burton's bizarre gothic world. It's also a good excuse to fork over a tenner for a re-release. The animation is short (really short), which means it doesn't outstay its welcome or leave you with a headache (it can be a lot on the eyes at times) and you'll get to keep a cheap pair of '80s style shades to boot!	4.0	Fantastic....	2007-11-02	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2QR035HCPBSLC	"The B ""ahnonamis"""	"It's hard to believe the first DVD release of Nightmare Before Christmas came out over 8 years ago, and that the movie itself is almost 16 years old. I still remember seeing it for the first time (despite complaints from my friend's parents) and falling in love with Jack Skellington and Tim Burton's bizarre new world. A musical about Christmas? Who cares! A musical about Christmas from the point of view of Halloween's monsters? Who wouldn't want to see that?As everyone knows by now, Nightmare Before Christmas has withstood the test of time, becoming one of the most popular (and most beloved) movies of all time, and easily the biggest stop-motion film of all time and the pinnacle of the craft. So with the new release of the movie and the two-disc collector's edition, it was an easy choice to put it on my list and hope Santa didn't find me naughty.For the three people who haven't seen the movie, Nightmare follows Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. After yet another drab Halloween, Jack wanders off to a forest he has never seen before, finding a strange array of trees. Opening several, he ultimately finds himself in different worlds; Christmas world is the one resonating most with the dejected skeleton.This ""Christmas World"" is so different from Halloween Town, Jack can't help but fall in love with it. Spying on its populace, he takes notes and returns to his home where he instructs the other denizens of Halloween Town that this year they won't do Halloween-they'll do Christmas!What follows is an entertaining mix of humor and music as the ghouls, ghosts, and ghastlies of Halloween Town prepare for Christmas, and ultimately try to wrestle control from Santa Claus himself.Unlike other re-releases, Burton and Disney didn't just release this to make a quick buck. (Okay, they did, but they also made that buck worth it.) For starters, the case is easily one of the coolest I've ever seen. What you can't tell from looking at pictures on Amazon is how big it is, and that it's in 3D. Opening like a book, the case is twice as thick as a normal DVD case, and the picture of Jack on the cover isn't a picture at all, but a pop-out 3D carving of everyone's favorite skeleton.The contents inside contain awesome goodies for fans, too.One of the special features shows Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour at Disneyland. For those unlucky enough to grow up outside of Southern California, this feature shows how the Disney Imagineers transform the Haunted Mansion ride at Christmas to relate to Jack Skellington and Nightmare, and offers several views and audio tracks ranging from how riders see it in-person, to the behind-the-scenes events which make it possible. It's a rare look into the background of one of the world's most storied theme park attractions, and worth a watch if you're interested in anything Disney, Nightmare, or engineering.In addition, there are Making Of featurettes (so much work goes into this movie...) and Tim Burton's own presentations on a variety of subjects. We have the reading of the original Nightmare Before Christmas poem complete with animation, two Tim Burton shorts (Frankenweenie and Vincent), deleted scenes, gallery pictures, concept art, and much, much more.Disney certainly didn't take the easy way out. This set is packed with extras fans will love (I don't think I've ever watched as many extras willingly as I did with this), a fantastic digital remastering, and the best DVD case ever. If you're a fan of the movie and already own Nightmare on DVD, this is-without a doubt-worth the double dip. Pick this one up, and donate your old copy to some kids who haven't yet experienced the masterpiece.Content - 5/5A classic. One of the greatest Christmas movies ever made, and one of the greatest non-live-action movies of all time. The soundtrack will be stuck in your head for years, and Jack Skellington will be stuck in your heart forever. There's a reason this was already one of the biggest DVD releases of all time, and this new edition will certainly add on top of that.Video - 4.5/5Not quite as nice as the Blu-Ray release, but a great improvement over the original DVD. Nothing was lost in this remastering; only gained. If you don't own an HDTV and a Blu-Ray player, this is the best Nightmare will ever possibly look. The detail on the dolls pops out, you can see all the expressions flawlessly... It just looks good.Audio - 5/5""What's this!?"" One of the most addictive soundtracks of all time with an improved audio, that's what. 5.1 surround with a nice mix, the songs and world of Halloween Town have never sounded better.Replay - 5/5I know many people who watched their original Nightmare DVD so much it was wearing out. This will easily replace those, but with the new bevy of features you may need to re-buy down the road once the DVD player stops recognizing the disc from wear. Then again, this comes with a digital copy so you're probably good. Watch it every Christmas, watch it between Christmas, watch it whenever. Nightmare Before Christmas is always good.Overall - 5/5If I could go higher than a 5, I would. Nightmare Before Christmas is a true classic in cinema, and this Collector's Edition offers so many new features and improvements on the original DVD release from 8 years ago that it's a must-buy for any movie fan, even if it means you're going to double dip."	5.0	A classic that will never die	2009-08-08	1	1	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	ADB8XCKNSDY5Z	theboombody	I have mixed feelings about this movie.  The premise is wonderful, the character designs are spectacular, and the animation is beyond marvelous.  But it feels like some of the movie is missing.  It's almost as if the first 30 minutes of the movie was cut out.  The plot is rushed into before the characters have time to develop so there's no chemistry in Jack's romance, which looks like it was practically tossed in at the end.  Maybe if some of the songs were removed there could have been more room for development.  Or perhaps the film could have been made longer (something I almost NEVER recommend but would be okay with here).  The Danny Elfman soundtrack is terrific of course, but it's tough trying to develop character and plot through music alone, especially in a film that's only an hour and sixteen minutes.  I think the attempt to make this into somewhat of a musical was just too ambitious.  I wouldn't rank this as high up as Pee-Wee's Big Adventure or Big Fish where a lot more goes into the development of the protagonist.I still can't believe this movie came out way back in 1993.  Amazing.	4.0	Was it too ambitious?	2010-05-23	1	0	1

It's all very slick, but boring and a little offensive. The characters don't interest me. The story doesn't intrique me. The energetic musical style that pervades the whole thing is irritating.

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1PFS615MIKWJ2	Tina F.	Our son thinks he likes to watch scary movies, probably because we do, but every time he watches one he is scared for months and takes up camping out in our room.  And I am talking about mild scary movies.  Anyway, since Halloween is approaching he started his annual &#34;I want to watch scary movies&#34; rant and we came across this movie.  I know this is a classic but me nor my husband had ever seen it (not really our kind of scary movie).  But this is definitely a great Halloween movie for kids.  Not too scary and definitely not gory.	4.0	Surprisingly good	2013-10-23	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	"Long had I dreaded the day when I would be forced to sit down and watch ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".  Not because I thought it would be horrible - in fact, I expected it to be quite good.  I've always loved Tim Burton, and the premise sounded great.  So this Christmas, when my brother received it for a Christmas present, I finally sat myself down and watched it.The storyline is great: Jack Skellington, Halloweentown's spookiest spook, is getting sick of Halloween.  One day, he stumbles across a door which leads him into Christmastown - and immediately, Jack is entranced by this jolly world in which all is good all the time.  And so Jack decides to bring Christmas to Halloweentown.I can sum up my thoughts about the film in two sentences, as sang by the fabulous Danny Elfman: ""What's this?  What's this?""  This film is always rated very highly, but I found it to be extremely bizarre, creepy, and even a little repulsive.  I wouldn't dream of showing it to my kids, with the eerie creatures and lines such as ""Kidnap Santa, chop him into bits"".  The animation was fantastic, but I thought the rest of the film was weak.  There is, however, one great song, ""What's This?"".While I can understand people enjoying this film, I just couldn't.  It's too bizarre, grim, and perhaps even grotesque for my tastes.  I suppose you'll just have to try it for yourself."	2.0	"""What's This?  What's This?"""	2005-12-27	31	11	20

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	ASC8B5SW28TH8	Tom	This review is not about The Nightmare Before Christmas.  I  am sure it is a wonderful movie by itself. Although, to me in looked very dated.I have a great 3D TV.  Every single movie I have ordered in 3D has been amazingly beautiful to watch.  Except for this one.  I know it cannot  be the 3Dor my TV  because the minute it started the menu that says play just popped out of my screen perfectly.There were two choices  play in 3D and play in 2D.  I chose 3D.  But the movie looked flat flat flat.  There was nothing about it that looked like 3D.I am wondering now, as I write this if somehow I thought I chose 3D but did not move the chooser to 3D.  But then why would the menu look so 3D.Please, others of you with the move,  does it look very flat to you too?  Was it a mistake with my DVD player not moving the chooser to play 3D correctly.My stupidity?  Does this movie really  play in full dimensional very noticeable 3D. Because I tried 3 times and each time I could not see the 3D at all.  AndI have tons and tons of 3D movies. And always can see the dimensionality perfectly.  I returned it because of this problem i had viewing it. But would gladlyrepurchase if you tell me I just did not get it to play properly.  I want to know if this movie really pops out like all 3D movies do and matches the quality ofthe menu before the movie plays. I'd appreciate your help.  I wanted to love this so much.  Was I just careless and not viewing it right?  I did try a couple of timesand thought I chose 3D version.  Thanks in advance for your help  and kindness.  Thanks so much.  I gave it four stars for the movie. And left one star for the3D so far.  :)	4.0	3D did not look like 3D	2012-10-24	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1WL2EKE4TAEJP	"Tyler Durden ""Mutton Man"""	"When this movie was released ten years ago, it was moderately successful at the box office, but at least the critics loved it. I had no interest in this movie at the time. But when my dad rented it, I became a bit skeptical at first, but upon my first viewing, it was something I thought of as ""weird,"" but in a good way. The musical numbers were insanely addictive, and the storyline is one of a kind. And the stop-go animation... it seems dated now, but not with this movie. Forget the astonishing visuals of Disney/Pixar's movies (or for that matter, DreamWorks Animation), this movie is art and is still many times better than ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Shrek.""Now fast-forward to 2003. I didn't know of a DVD release until a friend of mine brought his and I asked if I could borrow it. Once I watched it, all I can think of was, ""This movie is art."" I catch myself singing a few songs, become dazzled by its animation, and still get intrigued by its story. I just wonder to myself why I didn't appreciate this movie when it was first released. But my answer was that it didn't grab my attention. Kids don't really appreciate movies like this. I was one of them. Come the teen years, thoughts may get turned around, like what just happened to me. I can't praise the movie itself enough, this is art, people.Now it gets the treatment it deserves: a Special Edition DVD packed with many extras like behind-the-scenes footage, making-of featurettes, and deleted scenes. It's an essential for Disney enthusiasts, but probably not intended for smaller children which may seem a bit scary at some parts.What just ticks me off is how a lot of teenagers are just all of a sudden liking this movie. And I blame Hot Topic for turning this movie into a trend that has recently been forgotten (thank goodness). All that this movie stood for was lost during that time. Kids/teens didn't look at this movie as art. They just thought that if they wore a Jack Skellington shirt or sweater, they looked cool, or they tried to be a ""social outcast."" Well, I'm glad that trend is dead (it just took one year for it to end) and now I can enjoy the movie in its prime and the way it was intended to be viewed: A visually beautiful musical that ranks up with Disney's great animated classics.(...)"	5.0	Hmm... another review of mine...	2004-09-01	3	3	0

It was also the first full length movie of it's kind, I believe... Tim Burton utilizes Stop-Motion Animation, giving this classic it's own unique style.

Long story short, my wife and I purchased a 3-D DVD player and Nightmare was our first 3-D movie. All I can say is the 3-D conversion is excellent! The depth of visuals resulting from this 3-D enhancement are extremely impressive! I could continue to rave about this movie, but instead will just say this: If you have a 3-D Blu-ray DVD player, you owe it to yourself to buy this movie. Excellent 3-D conversion and the wait to receive the dvd was short. Amazon was stocked and we received the movie quickly. Great Service!	5.0	3-D Makes A Great Movie Even Better!	2011-12-31	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	ASJ89T42CIUHU	V. Marshall	A great adult animation film!! Tim Burton has blended stop action animation into a world of fantasy that is worthy of watching again and again.Jack Skellington is a long lanky skeleton who exists to inspire a creepy town on Halloween but alas he begins to desire something more. In his explorations he discovers an opening into a Christmas town where life exists with lights, presents and gaiety. Because of the theory that the grass is always greener on the other side our sad Jack feels the need to possess Santa and bring him back to his own dark Halloweentown while Jack becomes the new Santa. The story is great and a darkly humorous slap in the face of our over commercialized Christmas holiday. Along with Jack a cast of interesting characters exist in Halloweentown: Dr. Finklestein (a silly duck like version of Frankenstein), Sally (a lightly sewn together lady who needs a lot of stitches), Mayor (a two faced fatso with constant anxiety), and many others just as entertaining.This film would not be complete had it not been for Danny Elfman's musical score. The background music is really beautiful along the lines of a fairy tale with twists of horror laced in between. The lyrics for the songs are brilliantly poetic in a Halloweentown type of way and you may even find yourself humming a few for days afterwards. This is a must see DVD for every Halloween to come and maybe even the following Christmas just to add some nightmares into the overly sappy day!	5.0	Christmas Is The Real Nightmare!	2004-08-09	0	0	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A1Z9GEORNF736E	"V. Redmond ""Nessie Crunch 53"""	Another one of my friends got this for me as a gift. Again, I was giddy with delight (they all know me so well)! While I thought it odd that Disney would reproduce something that was fairly dark, it was so great to see this movie again, as I hadn't seen it in years. The remaster was wonderful as the colors were more vibrant. I especially loved all the bonus features like Frankenweenie, Vincent and The storyboard to film comparison. I thought the cost was high at first, but when I saw the 3D bust as the cover and all the extras, I realize the cost was quite fair. This is a great buy for followers of this cult classic or anything Tim Burton.	5.0	'Tis truly A nightmare Before christmas	2008-10-05	1	0	1

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A23NSKTMSPPBTR	Wayne	A problem with the review section is that is does not differentiate among the many releases and formats of this movie.  I have a VHS copy that I must have had for over a decade.  Many of the reviews are for various DVD transfers.  But the one I am reviewing is the Blu-ray version.The quality and clarity of this presentation is stunning.  I could not have imagined I'd be seeing the level of detail that is presented here.  If I had to name a fault, it was so clear that it made me aware of just how much the models have improved since this movie was made. In newer movies such as Corpse Bride, there's an improved feeling of flow to the animation. In this one, characters such as Sally appear as cruder toys when seen with all the detail. But those details are all consistent with the intent of the production.Once I got beyond the initial surprise of the Blu-ray transfer, I was able to enjoy the movie more than ever before.  The contrasts between the sets for Christmastown and Halloweentown reveal the true artistry in a way that the limitations of DVD did not allow. The transfer shows off the true differences between stop motion and the best of computer animation in a way that leaves one with a feeling of awe.I won't go into the details of the movie itself, since it's been around long enough that others have done so exhaustively. I don't know what criteria critics are supposed to apply to decide when something is one of the greatest movies ever made.  But in my subjective opinion, this one ranks among the best.If you share my view of the film itself, getting the Blu-ray version is well worth it, even if you think the DVD version is already impressive.	5.0	Stunning quality	2008-11-14	1	1	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A25PM9JGHPU8EI	Wes	A technical matter - this was filmed @ 1.66:1, meaning that when you play it back on your HD widescreen it is going to show as a box with black borders all around it. If it were properly handled, an anamorphic transfer would blow the image to fill most of the screen except for small black vertical bars along the sides of the screen. If you play this back on a standard 4:3 television it won't matter - it will look just fine. Aside from that, the dvd has an excellent collection of materials. Luckily, I own the HUGE deluxe CAV LaserDisc boxed special edition and it looks like they managed to port all of it to dvd (except for the companion book by Frank Thompson). You could spend weeks admiring this film, frame-by-frame, so meticulous in detail. Elfman's great songs match very well with the story and perfect animation.	4.0	Almost 5 stars except for...	2006-01-30	3	1	2

Tim Burton has a very unique way of picturing movies.. he can combine the most horrific pictures and themes into the most pleasant film that you have ever watched.. And he carries on the traditional throughout this movie.And the music is excellent (as it should be being from Elfman)..I however do not recommend the movie for the under 10 crowd.	5.0	Refreshing..	2002-10-26	0	0	0

6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	AGOQRCMGY2UK9	wonderlander	This is one of the most charming, and versatile holiday movies I have ever seen.  Jack really does just want to do something new, and doesn't think about the consequences, which is something everybody has done at one time or another.  When he gets warned not to do it, he ignores Sally because he really wants to do it.The love story is charming as well.  It's a mix of unrequited love, friendship, hero worship, and in the end it turns into real love.  The love story sub plot isnot the focus of the story.  The story is how Jack stole Christmas.  Not how Jack and Sally got together.This movie is claymation.  It also has singing.  I find that it makes the movie charming, some don't find it that way.	4.0	Rag doll and Bone daddy	2004-10-11	3	3	0

I decided to see this one because it was done by Tim Burton, who directed Batman Returns, Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow.  This is his best film to date.  It manifests Burton's usual creativity and eccentricity.  The vignettes of Halloween town and Christmas town are awesome.  The music won me over compeltely.  Every song is entrancing and beautiful, the characters are likeable and sweet.

Just watching the model making skills along with the lyrics of danny elfman bring the story to life. This movie isnt for kids anymore even the movie reviewer has to look at this movie very closely.And since seeing it in theaters since i was a mere lad to the new 3d apperance, i have followed tim burton's idea for years. and if it's that good on dvd, vhs, laserdisc, 16mm, they i would be really awesome if it was on psp.  plus your psp can double as a dvd player. so it's almost like buying the dvd if you have the right hookups and such. excellenct movie, and i would suggest buying cause i'm pretty sure it's outta print	5.0	awesome on vhs, dvd, laserdisc,	2007-09-30	1	1	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A2B8GXSCB1R05T	Zack Davisson	The Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful tribute to the Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass style of &quot;Animagic.&quot;  The denizens of Halloweentown surely attended the &quot;Mad Monster Party&quot; along with  Vincent Price.This film is very artful and atmospheric.  Both  Christmastown and Halloweentown are fully realized with little surprises in  every frame.  The puppets movements are smooth and fluid, even the facial  expressions.  Story and style blend flawlessly as Jack Skellington yearns  for something that he doesn't quite understand.  Danny Elfman's score is  appropriately spooky and moves the film along.  The songs are well sung  and add to the depth of the story.  A very nice blend of childlike horror  and fantasy.	5.0	Rankin/Bass lives again	2000-08-01	1	1	0
6303122647	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [VHS]	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	"Jack Skellington, the ruler of Halloween Town, is tired of doing the same thing every year for Halloween. One day, he accidentally makes his way into Christmas Town, and loves idea of Christmas so much that he tries to get the residents of Halloween Town to help him put on Christmas instead of Halloween, but unfortunately, things aren't going the way Jack wants them to.What I'd like to know is, when did the goth and emo kids take over this film, and Tim Burton's filmography, in general? Every time a Tim Burton film comes to theatres, emo/goth kids flock to see it and they cite Tim Burton as their god, when really he doesn't even make his films for them. He tends to appeal to the goth, emo, mis-understood type kids with movies like ""Nightmare"", ""Corpse Bride"", and ""Edward Scissorhands"". I wonder if those who worship the characters Jack Skellington or Edward Scissorhands have any idea that Burton made such classics as ""Ed Wood"" or ""Big Fish"". In my opinion, ""Big Fish"" is his best film, but ""Beetlejuice"" is my favorite Tim Burton movie, actually one of my favorite movies ever.They may or may not respect his filmmaking, I don't know about that, but it seems that all they care about is the fact that society associates them with him, so obviously they have to wear Jack Skellington memorabilia, and dress up as Edward Scissorhands or Beetlejuice for halloween.Just for the record, kiddies, Burton didn't direct ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". All of his ""huge fans"" seem to be under this misconception that Tim Burton directed the movie. He produced it, approved the songs, co-wrote the script, came up with the idea of making it a musical, and it was based on his characters. That's all. Most people know this, but there are still a lot of people who don't. These people usually are the ones to call themselves ""huge fans"" (the ones who buy Jack Skellington clothing at Hot Topic). ""TNBC"" is still a Burton film, nevertheless.The guy's not a perfect, ""god-like"" director that his emo/goth/misunderstood fans are making him out to be, and ""TNBC"" isn't ""THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!"", but nevertheless, he's a great director, and ""TNBC"" is a great movie. Tim Burton should be thought of as a director, not as a trend."	4.0	"Tim Burton's ""The Night Before Christmas"""	2006-03-15	3	2	1

I own and love this movie. It's about a skellington named Jack Skellington. He is the Pumpkin Kig of Halloween town. Everyone loves him but he starts to get sick of Halloween. He wants some thing new and wonderful. One day he was walking aimlessly in the woods and came to a circle of trees with different holiday doors on them. He opens the Christmas door and and lands in Christmas. He loves it and decides to make a Christmas of his own. It doesn't exactly turn out as he planned and everything goes wrong.

Despite not enjoying much of his new work, not caring for his lack of characterization nowadays, I enjoy Tim Burton's older films. The Nightmare Before Christmas is another class and essential for the Halloween season. Animation was beautifully disturbing, songs were a blast, and it ran at perfect timing.My only complaint was how the DVD playing. No menu screen that allows you to navigate to the movie or special features? Really? I thought the VHS tape era was over. So... not sure if the DVD was being nostalgic on purpose or just being cheap.Probably cheap!5 star movie but 1 star for the way this DVD plays.
