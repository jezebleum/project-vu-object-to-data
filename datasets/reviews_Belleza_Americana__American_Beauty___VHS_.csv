0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2UEW04N38LVB	2many2read	"The entire movie, while portraying a guy at a dead end in life, has an energy and suspense to it that keeps you watching.You know throughout the movie that a lot is not right in this comfy suburban paradise. It seems that everyone in the film is off track, and gradually losing it.  You wonder whether outside forces will crush the main character, Lester Burnham,brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey.  Or whether he will explode.This is one of my favorite Spacey films.  His redemption films like Pay It Forward do not appeal to me.Really worth seeing more than once.  Of course, if the mere setting of movie in ""blissful American suburbia"" makes you cringe, this is not for you.  But if you can get past that, it's a terrific film."	5.0	Masterwork made from ordinary materials	2005-11-09	4	3	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2NFTFQYW8GXIQ	A. Andersen	The world loves this film and so did the Academy giving it eight nominations (including undeserved ones for Editing and Score) and Oscared it five times (Film, Actor- Spacey, Director, Cinematography and  Screenplay).  I can see the noms for Spacey and Bening.  I can even see a  nom for Screenplay, but there it stops.  This film was merely diverting  and interesting - it was in no way the best film of the year.  Politics at  play once again.  When it was over I was not enlightened, intrigued or  uplifted.  It was a diversion - no more, no less.  Wes Bentley impressed  as a newcomer but other than that....  it's not a great film, I predict it  will be quickly forgotten.	3.0	Off beat satire on dysfunctional family values	2000-07-27	19	7	12
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1SGMKU9B5JED3	Aaron J Saxton	I don't know how anybody could dislike this film. In my mind, not only is this the best picture of 1999, but is one of the best films ever created. Unless you seriously can't watch a movie that doesn't have a &quot;happy ending,&quot; I highly suggest this movie.Kevin Spacey's and Thora Birch's parts were done to perfection, and Mena Suvari is absolutely amazing in this movie. Sam Mendes did a wonderful job with this picture, and the story written by screen writer Alan Ball was emulated perfectly.The only negative point I came across in the film was the overacting at times by Annette Bening. Aside from that, this movie truly is marvelous!	5.0	Marvelous	2000-09-26	0	0	0

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AF3DZZ6ZE4AGZ	A Customer	I think that with this kind of movies American film production attains a refine standard from the point of view of 'inner social criticism'. No useless special effects but the true, hard,  complex reality of the so  defined normal people. It is socially very inportant to underline how sad,  and banal, and empty the life of well-off people may be. Full of objects,  empty of true feelings. Kevin Spacey's little revolution - unfortunately  (but who knows: his life was death), lasts 24 hours. It's a pity, but a  good example to follow. The film is also very well done. Wonderful  photography, montage, interpretation. Fantastic script. Gorgeous.	5.0	American self-criticism	2000-02-03	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1JZDF1WDS5816	A Customer	When I first saw American Beauty I was stunned. At how wonderful this movie is. I feel I can relate to every character on at least some level. Annette Benning, Thora Birth, Wes Bently, Mira sorvieno (sp?), and of  course Kevin Spacey did a wonderful job. After watching the movie it made  me think.. and reflect on my life and how I live it. And belive it or not,  but it actually inspired me to care more about myself, to work out, and to  look at the little things in life. I saw this movie 9 times in the theatre  and watched once renting it. And yes, this may seem excessive..but once you  watch it you will see for yourself how great of a movie it is.	5.0	American Beauty THE best movie ever made	2000-05-14	0	0	0

Go ahead and scroll down to &quot;pacebm's&quot; review for more details; he or she did a nice job of analyzing all the weaknesses.  The one thing I didn't catch anyone mentioning was how one-dimensional the gay couple is (and how they also happen to be the only people in the neighborhood who aren't dysfunctional).	3.0	A paradox	2000-12-13	2	2	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	"The film begins with a young girl talking about her Dad. ""Do you want me to kill him?"" This tells you it will be a sicko movie! Then we see a street with a voice from a man with psychological problems. There are weird neighbors for this strange family. Lester has a job in advertising (professional lying?); is he expendable? There is conflict at the dinner table. ""What happened?"" Carolyn is in real estate sales, she has lookers not buyers. [Are her emotions embarrassing?] Jane is a cheerleader with emotional problems. Lester has a fantasy; is he pathetic? Does Angela have a problem too? Is a neighbor a voyeur? ""Oh, gross!"" Are the other neighbors strange? What's their business? [Does it seem like a cartoon drama?] The character of Angela is displayed as if to suggest future failure. Is their conversation real? Does Ricky look too old for high school?The film runs on with conversations that seem weird. What kind of job does Ricky have? Why is Angela so friendly? Are their conversations real? Does the story drag on? [Did people really sit through this movie?] Why is Ricky being tested? Would a dealer trust a new customer? Is Lester slowly going crazy? Can you believe this story? Its like a life of people who will show up on ""Jerry Springer"" or some other freak show. Is there a cure for being stressed out? [Another unbelievable scene?] Why would anyone be scared of Ricky, the friendly neighborhood dope dealer? They show a video that is more boring than this movie. Pathetic? Does the dinner conversation seem unreal? Lester doesn't recognize the music! Spaced out? The film continues to drag on, testing the viewer's patience.Mister Fitts bursts into his son's room for a violent confrontation. [Did it wake you up?] ""There are rules in life."" Another embarrassing scene follows. Carolyn takes up a new hobby; she has that freedom. [I sense a tragedy about to happen.] Is the film going downhill? Is Lester cracking up? Are Jane and Ricky having problems? Will they plan a felony? [Does it seem real?] Can a family be that sick? [The film heads to a crisis.] The framing of scenes is suggestive. [Does it satisfy the hidden desires of the writer?] Are the actions of Jane believable? Or the speeches? Is the writer just creating his fantasies? Does Angela seem credible or a victim of sexual abuse? Is Lester credible in his act? Will a romantic triangle end in violence, like some operatic tragedy? Does the writer avoid the logical conclusion of his story? Is the ending as stupid as the preceding film?I wonder how much of a pay-off is needed to buy great reviews for this film? [Local newspaper reviewers used to praise the films shown by its advertisers.] I did not find it moving or funny, did you? Is it designed to demoralize the viewing public? Does this movie suggest that people in advertising are sick mentally? What about the writer and producers?"	1.0	An Ugly Freak Show	2009-06-26	22	3	19
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3JXOXKWOIETIY	"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse"""	"American Beauty adds to the list of mediocre Oscar winners such as Forrest Gump. This film is very much like a TV sitcom with a few twists. Kevin Spacey has that appealing persona, though his character doesn't have much depth. His wife is an extremely unappealing character, and very annoying. The kids are okay and have some funny one liners. There are some good impressionistic effects such as the red rose petals covering the foxy cheerleader. The lady sitting behind me in the theatre was laughing hysterically at things I considered slightly amusing, and she cried at the end. I have no idea why. The overall effect of the film is the typical midlife crisis, with some bizarre and unbelievable incidents... Also the film explains too much, the mark of directing for the masses (""you know I'm kidding, dont you"") I give the film 3 stars for Spacey's acting, good as usual, but the film has no message beyond what a cutting edge sitcom's message would be. But in that case better to watch Married with Children.  When the writer accepted the academy award for this he thanked a paper bag...I'm not joking."	3.0	Another Mediocre Oscar Winner	2000-04-01	5	0	5
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A30IJNOA7804ZS	Adam Daniel Miller	"Characters need to be real. In Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty"", they are more real than some people in actual society at times. It's true that some of the characters are a bit exaggerated, but they all come from a deep truth that makes everyone of them entirely believable as being actual people. While the events and characters in this film seem like something that could never exist, in all actuality, everything in this film could be entirely real and that's what makes this is a great film. It's hard to say exactly what this film is about specifically, for there are many takes about what the film is truly about. For me, however, I like to say that, in a nutshell, the film is basically about Lester Burnham, played to perfection by Kevin Spacey,  and how his life isn't going so great, so he decides to turn things around for himself and in doing so, turns everyone else's lives upside down. I read a review that completely thought there was no reality in this film, and I feel he couldn't have been more wrong. There are two main elements that make this film so real in it's presentation. The characters and the locations, meaning what there was behind both of them. Everyone in this film is probably, in some way, like someone you know. Whether it be exaggerated a lot or a little, the people in this film are more real than even some of us are. Look at the Burnham`s. We have the workaholic wife, the rebellious teenager, and the mid-life crisis father. It may seem clich&eacute;, but that's only on the surface. I bet there's a family out there, that you know personally, that fits this bill exactly. The point is, although these characters seem like something you've seen before, it's that reason right there that makes them so special. This feels like it can happen the way it is presented in the film and therefore it makes us care. The fact that there is at least one character for everyone in this film that they can entirely relate to makes this such a strong piece. Lester is my personal favorite. He's a middle-aged man going through a mid-life crisis. What does he do about? He tries to recapture his youth. He smokes pot, starts working out, and fantasizes about high school girls. As I read in another review, and I entirely agree with this, ""This is the man we could all be one day. It's as depressing as it is beautiful."" This thought struck me hard and completely opened my eyes to how great Lester is. Lester is all of us, in some way, and therefore is able to take us to places we might have never been before, to see what may be or what may not. As far as location goes, nothing could have felt more real than what was portrayed in this film. It mainly took place in a suburban town, but the interesting thing is we never really see just how spaced out everything is. What's so lifelike about it is the main idea that, on the outside, everything looks right as rain, but underneath what meets the eye, there is a lot of strange things going on. Just to name a few: adultery, drugs, underage drinking, homosexuality, sex, invasion of privacy, and murder. The interesting thing about all of these is that they happen all the time in daily life right under our noses. What this film is can really be said as an inside look and what life can be. The way the film is presented makes this feel like it all actually happened, and that we are to believe all of these events actually occurred in a town that could have very well been the town that we are currently living in.In my mind, this film had very few, if any flaws. It felt like real life. Not entirely the life that we live in, but a variation on what could be. Once again, an exaggeration of what life may or may not be. I once had a teacher who had told me when she saw a movie and thought is was just a decent movie, she called it a ""movie"". However, when she saw a movie that was, to her, incredible, she referred to it as a ""film"". In case you missed it, to me ""American Beauty"" is a ""film""."	5.0	How Real It Is	2006-04-04	1	0	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A7LEHQWBZIOTJ	Adam Gibson	It is not often I finish watching a film by saying 'Oh My God' out loud. Let be more specific: this is the first time. As a piece of entertainment, it is exceptionally good. Amongst all the other great things (cinematography, acting, etc.) I would particularly mention the script - there are some outstandingly witty and funny lines, as well as some monologues that may well move you to tears.One point I would like to make which few others seem to have done - this film is expressing ideas which have been told us by mystics of all religions throughout the ages - to see the sublime in the mundane, or even the repugnant, simply by waking up to ourselves. &quot;We think we are alive but in fact we are simply asleep in life's waiting room.&quot; It carries this message across in such a beautiful artistic style that it will send shivers down your spine.Kevin Spacey here gives the performance of his life, in a role he was born to play.The DVD (thankfully) does have director's commentary, unlike so many other great films released on this medium, but do you think Sam Mendes could say 'the lighting in this scene was fantastic' a little more often ? ;-)	5.0	Mystical	2000-12-02	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2AVGD6OIIRG1R	Adam MacLeod	Many people misunderstand the purpose of the explicit nature of this film.  Personally, I feel that this film is making fantasies into realities and conflict as to aid in one man's discovery of life.  Spacey is supposed to  represent the conglomerate of all male apprehensions and fantasies that  coincide with middle age.  This film displays all of the fears and feelings  he has being a middle-aged father in suburbia.  All of his impulses become  realities and eventually lead him to see the inherent beauty infused into  life.  This movie's purpose was not to be vulgar, nor to offend the  squeamish.  It was supposed to display one man's quest to discover the  wonder of life.  I recommend this movie to anyone who will try to watch  with an open mind and not cringe at the slightest deviation from normalcy.	5.0	A unique outlook on the inherency of beauty within life	2000-05-20	3	1	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A225TBSWA7YAPR	"ad_crumenam ""ad_crumenam"""	I sat down with my copy of American Beauty last night and watched the film again for the first time in almost a year.  The older I get, the better this film gets and the more realistic it becomes.  When the film was first released, critics raved about how unique the characters were, but I disagree.  For every character in that film, I have known at least one person upon whom it could have been based.  Because of that, I feel like I actually know the characters.  Instead of being an outside observer, I feel almost like part of the action because the characters' behavior and emotional dysfunction is so very familiar to me.  Anyone who grew up in middle class America will probably know what I'm talking about.  The DVD itself is exquisite.  I don't know how they managed to cram all of that onto a single disc, but my hat is off.  The picture quality was vividly real, the sound was amazing, and the movie is as utterly engaging now as it was when I saw it the first time, about two years ago.  If you don't own it already, what on earth are you waiting for?	5.0	Just remembered what a terrific film this is	2002-02-27	9	8	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1OMEH970G0Q7Q	Adrian A. Shelton	This is a truly beautiful story; when watching it, I felt like I was reading a very compelling book, seeing it all being acted out before me. Kevin Spacey is an accomplished actor. Mena Suvari was very &quot;talented.&quot; Yet that wasn't entirely all what the movie was about. It was a story about random suburban life anywhere in America. An unappreciated man, with a materialistic wife, a troubled, ignored daughter, a very &quot;hungry&quot; girl, and a &quot;strange&quot; yet very smart filmmaker are the main characters in this very engaging screenplay. All props go out to those who played in the movie, and certainly director Sam Mendes. If you haven't seen this movie you have missed out on an all-time classic that will never, ever grow old in years afterwards.	5.0	I see why it won BEST PICTURE...	2000-09-25	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AMP7TQRWAIE84	"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D"""	"Let's get this out of the way: Annette Bening (Carolyn) totally steals the show. She shows so many different sides to a human being, especially the extreme. She's super peppy and I almost loved to hate her in the movie. Kevin Spacey was pretty good. He plays a depressed man named Lester who's highlight of the day is pleasuring himself in the shower in the morning. In many ways I could relate to this character. Actually, most of the characters are relate able. Lester and Carolyn have a daughter by the name of Jane. She's pretty mean to her parents and wishes they would just disappear. I liked her character, but Mena Suvari's character was even better. I like the scene where some girl says ""You're no goddamn Christie Turlington."" Her response to that was very funny.The ending was quite exciting with many things going on so I was definitely sad when it was over...I'm glad they never made a part II to it too because they probably would have tainted the name.I left a lot out but I'll just say that if you haven't seen the movie, you really need to. Rent it, buy it, borrow it from a friend; whatever. Just get your grubby paws on it. It shows how beautifully messed up life can be.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A28NIXW8PAJEYA	Adrian Heathcote	This film has been so immoderately praised that it is time, perhaps, for a more sober assessment. And when you get below the hype there is not much here to get excited about. Take the acting. Kevin Spacey does not act particularly well in this film, in fact he hardly acts at all - he walks through the part, looking every bit as smug as he does when interviewed. To suggest that this role merited an Oscar is to lose any sense of what acting is all about. Similarly with the script: it is not bad, but hardly a masterpiece. In fact it is full of tedious, shop-worn, caricatures, the most unpleasant of them being the martinet father who turns out to be a repressed homosexual (natch!). Shades here of Lawrence's Prussian Officer. But if a writer has to resort to this kind of easy target then he is really not working hard enough. But then the whole script is just too easy. Does the film end up telling us anything new about a mid-life crisis? Not really. Poor Lester Burnham rediscovers the power of lust and a good workout. Good for him. Only the cinematographer, Conrad Hall, really deserved the Oscar that he got. The film looks good - unfortunately this beauty is really only skin deep.	2.0	The Emperor's new Clothes	2000-12-19	20	7	13

Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning are fabulous together. Sorry, Hilary Swank but Annette deserved the Oscar more than you did for Boys Don't Cry. Spacey respectedly won his little statue, what a talented actor he is. Chris Cooper is so creepy in this film, I love his acting as well, such a natural, he picks roles no one dares to play. The tagline for this film is ""Look Closer"" which is perfect because you think people who live in the suburbs have it all, a nice car, beautiful house, and the perfect family and this film shatters all those myths in two hours. This film is gorgeous to look at, all bright colors flash from frame to frame. Wes Bentley plays the ""confident"" neighbor who lives next door who discoveres everything is not as it seems.

Seemingly when I discuss my opinion with others, all they will tell me is "" Well wait until your over forty and you'll get it."" Look I GET IT! But if I have to see this movie again at forty it will be too soon. The gimicky story structure infuriated me with its plot device ridden script (Was it necessary for the neighbor's father to be gay? The plotting of the scene where Chris Cooper kisses Spacey was SOOOO cheap!) None of the preformances convinced me one bit. I don't care how many Oscars this one took home, winning an Oscar does not a good film make. If your idea of a good time is seeing Kevin Spacey toss it in the shower and chase little 16 year old cheerleaders, while a closet homosexual next door beats up his son than this flick is for you.

I realize that I put myself in the vast minority by panning this flick, but I cannot recommend this movie in the slightest.  The mechanics of the film were, admittedly, well done.  However, the plot, premise, and script ruin the entire viewing experience.While I acknowledge that there are some aspects of truth to the generally acknowledged depraved premise, they are not presented as the parody of American life that they are touted to be.  The vast majority of the people I talked to didn't like it because it made them think about what is wrong with our society but because they like what is wrong with our society.  It's the same sadistic pleasure people get from watching Jerry Springer or slowing down to look for blood on the pavement at an accident scene.  This window into the disordered mind of a &quot;typical&quot; suburban father and husband is more of a view into the intellectual and moral wasteland of Hollywood than into reality.	1.0	American Ugly:  Hollywood Does Jerry Springer	2001-11-26	33	15	18

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ACAO2J1XCS4FL	Alexander Suraev	The film is extremely good and it's evident. Less evident are the connotations masked by the title. Of course American Beauty is about  American Dream. But there is a lot more to that film.It's about the time  allotted to to every human being's life and sometimes when the time is over  you can go on living for several decades more. Kevin Spacey's character  somehow feels his time is over. Nothing can stand between him and his  death.The sentiment is not exclusively American. There is a lot of  well-off communities in Europe, Australia, etc.  The main character is  middle class but that does not mean it's just a satire of that social  strata. Middle class man is not blessed with a need to crave for daily  bread - the struggle that makes all existential quests look like something  extra.With all the basic needs satisfied and no time-consuming hobbies  acquired what's left to the 42-year old male? To provide for the family?  But the wife if aggressively self-reliant. Make the daughters future  bright? The little cutie is just enjoying the hardships of the transitional  age and she does not give a damn about the parents' problems. Having  problems is her privilege, it comes with the age.The sexual urge is  taken care of daily. With no outside parties involved.So he dies at the  beginning of the movie and then just enjoys the afterlife - that's Lester's  big secret from everyone. He is dead and it's such a joy to kick the  pillars of the proper middle life\middle class exiistence!The proper  job? Here goes the job - and he gets these $ 60 000 just to demonstrate  himself he can do that. Welcome to the joys of blackmailing.Then the  wife gets an earful of truth. The lame reuniting effort on that  too-expensive-to-lie-on sofa is nothing more than going through the  motions. The resulting sentiment is - Ah, to hell with that! -Why the  restraint in taking the precious gift of the daughter's girlfriend? I think  it's too meaningful to his taste - he's already had her in his dreams in  much more romantic settings. And since he is dead anyway these encounters  are no less valid than the more demanding physical act ahead.He is not  living, he is getting rid of life. Lester's pranks are funny and enjoyable  but very unlikely to carry him through the next few decades.He is that  dancing plastic bag from neighbour boy's video - he is moving, inflated by  the wind, raising and falling, there is no meaning in this, no future. He  is just as fragile and not caring.And there is no any value in  prolonging that dance. So he gladly accepts the bullet that makes his death  more evident to the family and the general public.So there are layers  beyond the American middle class tragedy - and the very funny tragedy that  is.Now about the title. It's open to interpretations. And that's  intentional.Americans are fond of looking in a mirror, of having  American psyche and American way of life scrutinized. They consider  European existential dramas in European settings boring - and very often  they are. The rest of the world is very attentive to the things American -  millions will come to see.Now Beauty. Whose beauty? The beauty of what?  Some will think that's the beauty of the blonde bombshell, some will vote  for the beauty Ricky Fitts sees in everyday life. Besides, beauty is an  universally appreciated word, the natural attention magnet.Join American  with Beauty and you have the mantra-like combination worthy of chanting at  the Oscars and Golden Globes ceremonies, the combination anyone is willing  to elaborate upon.Sam Mendes likes to make use of things that has  already helpend him to become famous. It's so nice to concentrate on a  girl's navel at the film's posters and DVD covers - just like on Nicole  Kidman's lower abdomen in the director's Broadway hit.The film is  classic. It's multilayered and so richly textured you are guaranteed a  discovery with every viewing. The acting is splendid, the casting - superb.  There are no faces we still love but are tired of seeing. That's definetely  a DVD material.Can't wait to get the disc!	5.0	Once is not nearly enough.	2000-03-16	4	4	0

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AF1VHA7BVWLO1	Alexia Komaux	"A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him.Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love.In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic and doesn't quite fit in with the movie's overall nihilistic themes. Ball's true message, therefore, is slightly blurred because we don't know whether his message came from his heart or from the portion of his brain that maximizes profits.Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with ideas you can think about. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One girl I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as she said, ""I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""Look closer."	5.0	Death of a Salesman for the 90's	2005-02-04	16	13	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2QGM63A8ZNSFG	"Alex Kalb ""akalb@clarku.edu"""	This movie was the best movie of the '99 year.  For once the Oscars actually got it right.  The movie is about family, and aging, and the things that motivate people.  Lester Burnham (Spacey) is having a mid-life crisis of sorts where he realizes that his marriage is empty, his relationship with his daughter is severely lacking.  That's when his youthful next door neighbor opens his eyes to the real wonders of the world. This is an incredible movie with awesome performances handed down by all the actors.  At times funny, at times touching, this movie is a true must see. The DVD presentation of the DVD is decent.  The commentaries are informative, the picture and sound are excellent.  Most of the documentaries on the disc are closer to fluff and probably not something you'll watch over and over, and enough time is spent talking about the cutscenes that one would have hoped that they made it onto the disc.  Still, this movie does sell itself and comes with very high marks.	4.0	American Beauty Rocks	2001-03-27	3	0	3

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3C6X0DAM87GN4	Alex Udvary	Did you ever feel like your family was\is dysfunctional? Or know someone who came from one? If you answer no to both of these questions,DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO WATCH THIS FILM! You'll find it to be disturbing,crude,and  offensive,which is everything it isn't. Times have changed,we're no longer  living in a &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; world,and believe it or not,but the  Burnham's are actually your typically family. Screenwritter Alan Ball has  managed to write a dazzling portrait inside an american family. He makes  everything seem &quot;real&quot;, and as I stated before,there are families  out there like this one,we believe everything we see on screen,this isn't  just due this a great screenplay,we have very good performances here too by  Kevin Spacey,Annette Bening,and Thora Birch as the Burnham's and Mena  Suvari also gives a good performance. There's a line in this movie which  goes something like this...There's so much beauty in the world sometimes I  just can't take it. That one line is the whole point of the film. We have  Lester(Spacey)a man who hates his job,him family and seemly life in  general. And he goes through this whole transformation,for what? He's  changing but is anything else? Everything will remain the same as before.  And it's at the end of the film he finally thats notice that while he  thought things were awful he didn't realize that he was happy. Now did this  movie deserve all the Oscar's it got? No. At least that's my opinion. I  felt that Eyes Wide Shut was looked over(It didn't even get a  nomination!),should any of the actors have won? No. But it would of been  nice to see Mena Suvari and Thora Birch nominated,I don't think they should  of won but a nomination would of been nice. What did deserve to win was  this truly great screenplay. Here's a film.that if you look at it in the  right context,can actually give one hope for things to come,but you have to  &quot;look closer&quot; to find the beauty in this film. And I think as  time passes,people will take notice.	4.0	A Contemporary Masterpiece	2000-07-09	22	8	14

The one-liners are insightful and pungent and reveal truths that we aren't always comfortable with. My favorite is: &#34;Never underestimate the power of denial.&#34;The actors all do a great job, with Kevin Spacey standing out above all. Every character is shown with depth, and it is easy to understand their struggles and desires.Mena Suvari also does a great job as Angela Chase, such a contrast to her role in _American PIe_. She is many ways a star as well, as her life ends up just being a &#34;commercial&#34; like everyone else._American Beauty_ is a movie which celebrates being true to oneself.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3H1PT7D2KR3R3	AliBelle	"I rented American Beauty and I expected to be horribly offended at the father's infatuation with the young girl. When the movie came out I was fifteen and the idea of someone's father lusting after me made me want to gag, however that was only a small part of the story, the rest of it was absolutely spell binding.Usually when I watch movies I knit, because I like to do two things at once but I could not get over how involved I was in the movie and the characters and how everything was not like it seemed.Annette Bening was fabulous as the controlling mother who had to have everything go her way but was really falling apart. I like the how Mendes showed how their marriage was falling apart because she was so obsessed with material things. Wes Bentley had some beautiful lines and Chris Cooper was stellar because he always is. The acting and writing was top notch as was the directing. I loved how there were mainly three colors used, black, white, and red. There are other colors obviously but those were the main three and they were used exceptionally well.I grew up in suburbia and I can attest things are not idyllic but they are not as melodramatic as this story was. I think the point was to show that people in the suburbs feel they have to hide their dissapointment and they lie to cover it up in disgusting shameless ways. The cinematography was gorgeous as well.Reading other reviews many people who had problems with this film had issues with the homosexuality, which ironically was a small part of the film and not offensive as a man lusting after a girl the same age as his daughter. I do not think the moral of the film was ""let's all be gay and let's hate American values"" it was to mainly look closer at a sterile place where everything was ""perfect and living the American dream"" and realize that no place is perfect and to appreciate beauty in flawed things-ie Wes Bentley's character and Kevin Spacey. I personally think that is a beautiful moral and that this is a beautiful and engaging film."	5.0	Haunting and Disturbing	2005-01-23	8	6	2

With its new age music, and true-to-life characters, it's an ode to the new century.

When he develops a crush on his daughter's (Thora  Birch) friend Angela (Mena Suvari), the movie twists into an odd mix of  romanticism and 70s nostalgia.Annette Bening's portrayal of Mrs.  Burnham is a too-true vision of job stress and marriage trouble in the 90s  (or 00s).

Probably very little, but here goes.This film is Risky Business and The Graduate for  the YUPPIE set; and that's not a bad thing. It has the re-coming of age  qualities of both films.Lester can't live another day in the charade of  his somnambulate existence. Luckily (or maybe not), there are new neighbors  in Pleasantville. Ricky, the 18 year old kid next door, becomes Lester's  idol. He is one who appears to have life figured out. Don't stress; lie  only when necessary; and placate the enemy, while laughing  inside.There's also a nod to sex, lies and videotape; with Ricky an avid  voyeur, but more out of curiosity than perversion. It's as if he is an  calm, objective alien; taking notes on a typical family. But as the poster  reads and the camcorder zoom exhibits; look closer. Americana is crumbling  inside. This is nothing new. Any Freudian would tell you that (his  hysterical patients were seemingly normal housewives bursting inside from  years of supression).What makes this film work is the wonderful script,  incredible acting, haunting cinematography, and timing. It's as if it  needed to be made right now. You say you want a revolution? Well, here you  go. You don't need to hop on a bike with Peter Fonda. Just give up. Quit  the job you hate. Do what comes naturally; and most of all, be yourself.  Sometimes we need teenagers to teach us this. When they're not posing for  their friends, they're natural. They're alive. They're dreaming.	5.0	Kids Say the Darndest Things	2000-07-05	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1TD9JUXG1DGW3	"Allie Kat ""sarahphin"""	"Nothing here is as it appears. It's about shallowness, emptiness, and fleeting illusions, and as each shallow layer is peeled away, another shallow layer is shown. Lester Burnham throws off the outer layers of his shallow life after meeting a blonde cheerleader who makes him feel young again, and he becomes nave, prone to child-like rage, and shallow. There's a wife from an impoverished background who's trying to maintain her middle-class faade of gentility, an alienated daughter checking out breast augmentation, a philosophical boyfriend who deals drugs, a homophobic neighbour - each with more layers and masks. The rose-strewn nymphet of Lester's fantasies is revealed to be a trash-mouthed snob obsessed with appearances, then later either as just another insecure teenager, or possibly a tease who's playing ole Lester for a sucker. She's one of the symbols for the theme of the movie, which is about the beauty in our everyday lives. But all of the symbols for beauty, like the plastic bag blowing in the wind and the dead pigeon, are empty, or dead, which means the beauty is, too, and we're pretentious and shallow when we believe it's real.I had several problems with the movie. I felt that Annette Bening's performance was over the top for the character she was playing. Her theatrical gestures and rather farcical emotions in every scene didn't suit the hard-working and serious Carolyn Burnham. Granted, we know she's projecting a false image, and we find out she's certainly not stodgy, but it's a jarring discrepancy. We never really learn why the Burnham family members all hated each other, even before Lester's lust for the girl. Indifference would have made sense, but why the sheer hatred for each other? And it was difficult to separate the movie from the hype. Because of the ""hilariously satirical"" and ""uproariously funny"" advertising blurbs that accompanied it, I was expecting something quite different, or at least something with not quite such a message of hopelessness. The characters and the desperation in their situations are more the stuff of pathos than satire. All the characters were worthy of at least empathy from us, although I suspect Kevin Spacey's sweetness made Lester Burnham more appealing than he otherwise would have been. We may like them or not, or identify with them, or not, but laughing at them is cruel. We're always told to follow our hearts, and to do what makes us happy, but the message in this movie is that nothing is gained by doing so, other than false and temporary illusion, like the illusion that beauty is revealed to be. Perhaps that's the joke, and it's on us."	3.0	Layers of Emptiness	2000-10-15	45	19	26

It blows up in your face the first time you see it but if you see it repeatedly, as I have, there is even more depth to it  than You see the first few times. For example to tie in the American part  of &quot;American Beauty&quot; you will notice beautiful art direction with  the wonderful use of color in this film. The first time you may notice alot  of red but if you &quot;look closer&quot; you will see that the three  dominant colors are red, white, and blue. An examplke of this is when Ricky  Fitts is getting a ride to school from Mrs. Burnham and the shirts that  vthey are wearing are red, white and blue. This also happens in the picture  of the Burnhams family, the shirts are red, white and blue. This again  happens in Ricky's room with the video camera scene, the candles in the  background are red, white and blue. This is a common theme throughout the  film. If you have not seen it, see it, if you have and did not pick up on  the beautiful use of color, it is definately worth it to see it again. Its  easily the best film ever.	5.0	simply the best	2000-04-28	4	2	2

Or at least this movie does.Kevin Spacey, Anette Bening and their daughter seem like a wonderful all american happy family who live in a wonderful neighbourhood with wonderful gay neighbours. Then however, comes Lester's (Spacey) inside look into their lives. The wife is is a working mom who has turned into a complete workaholic whose only passion seems to be to beat her oponent in real estate. Lester has a lousy job with a company he can't stand. The daughter, although not as shallow as she may seem, is the ugly girl with the beautiful popular (or is she?) friend.Suddenly, one day, when Lester is about to lose his job, he realizes: I have nothing, it doesn't matter what I do, things can only get better! He blackmails his boss, gets a job at a drive through fast food restaurant, and adopts a completely new lifestyle. Meanwhile, the wife goes crazy with her new found love, her real estate enemy.The &quot;ugly&quot; daughter, who is in fact quite goodlooking, has problems of her own. The &quot;freak&quot; who lives next door has become obsessed with her. He follows her around with his camera, simply stands there silently and films her. Instead of scaring her, she becomes more and more interested in him. She finds him to be a lot more than simply a &quot;freak&quot;. He is an intelligent, individualistic person, interested in more than the shallow stuff teenagers are supposed to be interested in. He too has more dimensions than we initially see. Both are unique in the way they see beauty. It is not good looks, it is not popularity, it is everything. In a plastic bag, dancing on the wind...The mask is torn and the dysfunctional family becomes visible. But they don't care, they're living the lives they always wanted, no matter what people think. But will it last?Both Kevin Spacey and Anette Bening do some fabulous acting here. Bening plays her part very convincibly, and is extremely funny as the over-stressed workaholic working mom. Kevin Spacey is also perfect for the part, he plays his character in a very amusing way as well, especially when trying to hit on his teen daughter's best friend, who's a real American beauty as you find out later on.The characters are really charicatures of certain types of people, a good example being the boy next door's dad, an ex military man, hard on his son, hates homosexuals (or does he...?), makes his son do a urine test every couple months to make sure he's sober, amazingly written, very insightful.American Beauty is a very amusing movie, although very sad and a little depressing when you think abotu the characters a bit more, but absolutely an amazing movie. The fact that it was such a blockbuster movie made me a little weary of seeing it, considering the quality of many movies nowadays, but this came as quite a surprise to me. I actually saw it 3 more times after that and would gladly see it again. Almost everyone I know who has seen it, absolutely loved it, for various reason. Don't let the rating withhold you, if you're not into movies with nudity, strong language or drug use, because this movie contains very little, and is without a doubt worth it!!!	5.0	More than American Beauty, true beauty lies within this movi	2000-10-21	3	3	0

My dad is...I don't know what my dad is.  He quit his job technically, but I guess he conned his way into getting paid without working.  We used to be really good, but not anymore.  He's obsessed with my friend, Angela. She's a cheerleader at our high school.  She thinks she's so sexy and brags about all the people she's slept with.

He is a strange boy that goes to school and walks around with a video camera taping dead birds.  His father abuses him and is pro nazi.  I think I like Ricky.  Lately, I've been talking to him more.  He is...beautiful.....Oh, and me?  I am just an ordinary girl who's depressed.  I hate my parents because everything they do is for themselves.  They pretend to love me.  And as you can see, my life is not exactly the best........~~~That is the what life would be like in the shoes of Jane Burnham, who's life she believes to be one of the worst.  Portrayed by Thora Birch, Jane is not your typical ""hot"" chick you're used to seeing in high budget films.  Of course, she is not ugly either.  Perhaps...beautiful?  So says Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), who is the boy with the camera next door.  He likes to tape ""beautiful"" things, and has a strong interest in Jane.Now Jane's friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) is your stereotypical cheerleader--a little snotty, a little popular, attractive, and blonde.  Her physical features is what drives Lester Burnham, who narrates the film from underneath the tombstone.  Feeling the adversities of his marriage, job, and family relations, Lester feels dead.  It takes a scent to wake him up from his slumber and live again....a certain scent.....a rose perhaps.....Angela..........This film is about beauty.  It is about stereotypes and judegements.  The stereotypical features that are shown from the outside that are not always true.  In fact, they are far from true.  An ordinary girl may not be as ordinary as you think.  The strange freak with the camera who just got out of a mental house may not be such a freak afterall.  The typical blonde cheerleader may not be as sexually active as perceived.  And the seemingly ordinary parents are soon to be discovered as not quite so ordinary.  The only beauty in life does not come from all the sunsets, sunrises, snowy mountaintops, the accentuating blue sky, or the glow of the silver moon surrounded by millions of specks in the everlasting sky.  Perhaps beauty can be sought out within a dead bird?  A plastic bag?In this heavy movie which contains a bit of sex, drugs, money, power, and discrimination--all themes of drama--director Sam Mendes delivers a powerful, dramatic, yet comedic tale of America's beauty.  He defines America not as a wealthy country with independence and refinement.  Rather than depicting the Eagle that symbolizes America, he defines it with the Turkey--the actual symbol Benjamin Frankilm wanted as the Nation's bird.  Why?  Because turkeys are humble.  America is humble.  That is where our beauty lies.Mendes perfects this rendition of America with the help of cinematographer, Conrad Hall, and Thomas Newman with the musical score (Also did score for Shawshank Redemption).  Both played an important role to depicting the film's thesis.  The cinematography was tender, yet vivid in the most simplest sense.  My favorite shot was of the raindrops falling.  Watch and you'll see.  The music was mesmerizing....nothing more to say but great.  5-star movie, especially for those who rate films on high standards (more than just acting and plot).  This film was deep, comedic, sexy, romantic in an absurd way, and dramatic.  If you are looking for a hilarious comedy or something to lighten your mood, this one may not be the wisest of choices if you're not into deep drama."	5.0	A Rare, Mesmerizing Film....	2004-02-21	9	8	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2LZJ4XJS1A9XM	"Amazon Customer ""nospam"""	&quot;American Beauty&quot; brings a certain 'artistic' sensibility to mainstream film, but with more polish than one sees in many 'Art' films, to wonderful effect. The film scores points with me right off the bat for cinematography - aspiring filmmakers and photographers, buy this DVD.  Richly colored and majestic, the blend of fantasy and 'reality' in this film is seamless and used to great effect. The script is first rate,  showing us the brilliant resurrection and explosion of a lifeless American suburban family and the collateral effects on their neighbors. Kevin Spacey plays a middle-aged suburban husband who awakens one day and notices that he's completely alienated from his family, and that his life has lost whatever grace it might once have had. Taking this film a step beyond the &quot;mid life crisis&quot; cliche, his attempts to resurrect his own soul stirs the sleeping &quot;I&quot; in those around him. As with most heroic journeys, especially one in which the prize is so rich, there is a high price to be paid. More I will not say.  Capital-A Art is painful, and any film that can take what could be a 2-hour ad for &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; and turns it into a beautifully painful, compelling and even surprising character study of Life imitating Art imitating life deserves high praise. The studio deserves credit for allowing this film to be released &quot;as is.&quot; See the film - it's worth buying.  Oh, the commentary track on the DVD is very good. There are a few omitted scenes which really add nothing much, and the rest - I didn't bother. The film's the thing, to paraphrase the Bard, and a great film it is.	4.0	Attention should be paid...

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3SUTANSX6LC75	"Amazon Customer ""scifiwasabi"""	You've read all the rave reviews and they are all justified-but there were a few things that bothered me about American beauty. People often characterize Lester Burnham, the protaganist, as Everyman. However, the Burnham family is far wealthier than the average family in reality.  In addition, giving the family a generic name like Burnham and neglecting to show a single non-white face shows complete ignorance of what America is actually like.  I mean, take away the pot smoking and fornication and it could be a Leave it to Beaver remake. I did think that American Beauty was a provacative, daring film and I loved it, but I also think that the makers are trying to appeal to no one so much as  the self-styled Lester Burnhams in the audience; middle-aged, upper middle class white men who sold their souls for their careers and now want to have their cake and eat it too.  Ricky Fitts, the sensitive drug dealer, is a brilliant character and it's hard not to swoon over him but when push comes to shove, his pursuit of Jane sends the message that when girls say &quot;Leave me alone&quot;, they mean &quot;videotape me stripping for you&quot;. Angela is another inspired character who seems full of suprises but is basically the personification of the stereotypical self-centered tease who's all talk.  The one thing I cannot find fault with is the performances, with the possibility of Peter Gallagher whose tremendous eyebrows distract the viewer a bit. All in all, American Beauty is a thought-provoking movie that everyone should see, but think before you decide what you believe and who you admire.	4.0	Striking but not perfect	2001-08-16	3	2	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2D6IGKSOBQ3K9	Amethyst	This movie unfolds much like a documentary on everything that is wrong with America. The story begins with Kevin Spacey's narrative that this is his story of the last year or so of his life. So we start out already knowing that his character, Lester, has died for some reason. It is based on the lives of 2 families, and I think alot of personalities are represented. The over-bearing, prudish wife who is concerned only with appearances and what people think of her. She is repressing her true feelings to fool everyone, and herself, that she is happy with her life. She has forgotten how to laugh. Lester is the husband that needs to regain his self respect and stop living just to survive. Their daughter, Janie, is trying to deal with being different, fitting in and trying to find out who she is. Her friend, Angela, awakens something in Lester and makes him realize that there is more to life then trying to please everyone else. The next-door neighbors has the ex-army, homophobic man, who is more of an abusive drill sargent then a husband and father. He is a hateful person and clearly fears his own true feelings. His son is the one who helps awake Janie and show her the true beauty in life. I think this movie shows how destructive conformity and lack of self-expression is. We live with a great deal of this in this country. We are taught through religion or other means to feel guilt for natural feelings and to conform to what people think of as &quot;acceptable&quot;. At the ending of the movie, we witness that society's violence begins at the place where creativity and self-expression is controlled. The surreal vibe of the movie is brought to life with a haunting musical score and sprinkled with dark and witty humor. Of coarse Kevin Spacey gives a spectacular performance. I am sure people will get different meanings from this movie, but this is what I got out of it. Learn to accept yourself and enjoy finding your beauty.	5.0	Pictures speak louder then words	2002-10-17	1	0	1

It has some great parts to it, and some terrible parts that are easy to ignore the first time, but in future viewings tend to grate.the goodMost of the acting is excellent.  I like Keven Spacey as the downtrodden father and ""former center"" of the family.  A man that was obviously the bread earner at one point in time until his wife started to outshine him and the family lost respect for him in a whole(hypothesis).  Annette Benning is good as the woman is is emulating strength in order to gain it, who felt she was weak and was terrified by it.  So becomes the cold career woman who is terrified and emotionally weak when no one is around.  Mena Suvari was nice as the shallow best friend, who doesn't want to be ordinary.  As well as Chris Cooper playing the unlikable Col. Frank Fitts, someone with serious issues.The basis for the story was intersting.  Characters who pretty much design their lives to hide behind their fears.  The mother fearing weakness, the father fearing he was wasting his life, the daughter and her friend fearing being ordinary, and the former marine being in the closet about his homosexuality.Some of the visuals were interesting, many of them involving roses and Kevin Spacey's sexual fantasies.  But it had a bright, shiny, almost too clean feel.  Showing this upper middle class neighborhood as seemingly perfect until you get to know the people involved.the bad.Some of the acting was great, some of it was flat out terrible.  Thora Birch is attractive in a natural sort of way, but a terrible actress.  I wasn't at all interested in her character, a whiny brat that hated her parents for giving her this opulent lifestyle and wanted breast implants(pick an actress that might need them :).  The love interest was supposed to be this special kid that no one understood, which I didn't either.  He came off as a creepy slob who sounded like he was on the drugs he was selling most of the time.  The scene where he sees god in a bag blowing in the wind was wonderfully parodied in Family Guy.  All the scenes with them just seemed to fall flat.The idea of the marine in the closet was just cheesy, way too 90's.  I don't believe that every person who has something against gays is in the closet.Kevin Spacey's change was enjoyable, but him speaking in soft tones like he was a monk or holy man was too much.The ending was dissapointing in some of the mechanics.  What he saw as he was passing was great, but the dull boyfriend looking into his eyes and the smile he had on his face took away from the other elements that were being portrayed.This was a good movie, but like all good movies it is flawed.  Great the first time through, but doesn't hold up.  It is good for all types, as most people will find someting in it they like, though just as likely something they won't."	3.0	enjoyed it, but,........	2004-04-05	2	1	1

But the fact that this film arouses such emotion makes it very powerful one, indeed. In spite of what the content of the movie is, I challenge anyone to criticize the cinematic beauty of this film. It's rich colors, it's black and white scenes...The colors supported and enhanced the emotions and actions in a brilliant manner. This film is important. It makes statements about us- as a society- that take us out of our confort zone. It's not trash. It's real life in this day and age. And it ain't pretty. Kids are doing drugs. Parents are abusing their children. Homophobia exists as does pedophilia, infidelity, and middle age crises...It's an &quot;in your face&quot;  film but it's done with such beauty and sensitivity- you can endure it. Spacey and Benning gave outstanding performances. All of the actors/actresses were &quot;beautiful&quot; physically. There are so many ways &quot;American Beauty&quot; as a title can be interpreted...Is the Beauty Mena Suvari? Is it the film itself? Is it a sarcastic statement about our lives in America these days? Decide for yourself. This film is too controversial to miss. And if you really hated it, I don't think you want to get this deep with your entertainment.

Nothing short of watching the movie itself will truly convince you anyway. But let me just reiterate: it is as good as the hype says it is.First off, let me say how gratified I was that this movie walked away with lots of Oscars. It was like seeing the Good Guys win after a hard-fought battle, and something that happens all-too infrequently. I need only remind readers of the 10-nomination, zero-statue snub of Gangs of New York in 2003 (which I still find incomprehensible) as a reminder of how rare it is that a deserving mainstream hit drama gets an Oscar.What I find amazing is how affecting this movie is without any truly sympathetic adult characters. Kevin Spacey's Lester goes from downtrodden sod to pedophilic, blackmailing, unemployed, pot-smoking man-child/id. Annette Bening's Carolyn is the materialistic, status-grubbing matron-harpy. Chris Cooper, meanwhile, is the uber-hard-edged stereotypical military-guy, Allison Janney is a ghost, and Scott Bakula and Sam Robards are almost invisible.All this is true, yet you still root for Spacey's Lester as he cashes in, shapes up and smokes out. We yearn with Bening for something to take her away from the somehow painful numbness that is her life as she knows it. The moral stands taken by Cooper's Colonel Fitts, although wrongheaded in many respects, are the only ones in the film, and as a result make him the somehow-praiseworthy moral center. Add to this Mena Suvari as your local despicable it-girl and Wes Bentley as the voyeuristic drug dealer next door, and what you are left with is Thora Birch as the only true, if disaffected, innocent in the film.Yet some of the magic of the flm lies not so much in its content, as its comment on its viewers. Just what kind of people are we, to root for a man, even as he blackmails his company, buys drugs from his daughter's boyfriend and dreams about seducing her other best friend, all in the name of ""finding himself""? What does it say about us in that we find him lovable? And in a medium where not walking out and demanding a refund can be classified as acceptance, how much more so is both a huge box office take and multiple Oscars? Yes, this film has truly lived up to the hype of exposing the dark side of suburbia, but the exposure is not on screen, but in our own hearts.The remainder of this film's magic? That we neither squirmed nor flinched, but instead took it to heart with no questions asked."	5.0	A true cinematic classic and as good as the hype.	2004-01-29	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ADQ0MJ38TYB8B	Andrew Dobrenis	"American Beauty is perhaps one of the best examples of the fact that if you can be ""counter-culure"" then you will always have the sympathy of the critics.The story is essentially what teen-agers used to refer to as ""Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll"". In fact, the story has the feel of what a teenager would write. This is supposedly a critique of suburban culture, but other than being set in suburbia, there is little here that is particular to suburbia.The story's central character is a father who is disatisfied with his life. He lusts after his daughter's friend, his wife is focused on her career, and his daughter has the usual teenage angst over life, etc. His neighbour, who is not the business type, inexplicably reads the Wall Street Journal, (which any young person can tell you is the mark of an evil man). The neighbour's son sells drugs, so that makes him sympathetic and also means that he has a deep understanding of the human condition. Of course, the writers must have realized that drug dealers are not necessarily sympathetic characters to those over 20, so they made sure that the father (remember he reads the Wall Street Journal), is a man who viciously beats his son. In addition, there is another twist to his character that is straight out of an episode of Oprah.Our protagonist, disatisfied with his life, decides to quit his well paying job, which he felt was de-humanizing, and get a job at a burger joint (which is apparently not de-humanizing). He starts to do drugs and listens to classic rock tunes and his life is suddenly better. (See what I mean about the type of story that only a young kid can appreciate?) Alas, his wife doesn't go along with this. She wants to do well at her career and doesn't like it when our hero isn't careful to not dirty the furniture. Clearly, she is not ""with it man."" (Forgive the 60's phraseology, but that is where this movie belongs).One tired cliche after another is brought out to prove what is wrong with America, though frankly, none of the things they are criticizing are particular to America. (Oops, I forgot: Wall Street Journal = Evil).So why 2 stars instead of 1? The acting is quite good, and there is a certain dreamy like quality to the directing that hides some of the juvenile nature of the plot.Don't waste your time with this laughably immature film."	2.0	Counter-Culture = Good critical reviews	2002-03-07	11	6	5
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	Standing tall as one of my all time favorite films and one of the most deserved Best Picture wins of all time, `American Beauty' never loses its impression on me.  I'm forever in awe at its overall magnitude; its presence that is so overwhelmingly absorbing.  From Kevin Spacey's fantastic Oscar winning performance to each and every supporting player the cast is golden and the charisma and chemistry is dynamic and ultimately unrivaled.  What makes `American Beauty' so enthralling and captivating to me is the sheer relatable atmosphere and utter honesty that it portrays.  This is a life not unlike our own, with the same dilemmas and controversies, the same dreams and ambitions and no matter how perfect we think we have things there is always something missing, and sooner or later we're going to have to make a change in order to find our center.  Brilliantly, and I mean that with every fiber of the words very meaning, `American Beauty' fleshes out that very innate desire.The film follows Lester Burnham as he goes through his mid-life crisis, realizing that his wife doesn't love him anymore, his daughter finds him creepy and uninteresting, his job infuriates him; basically that his life in general is far from what he wants it to be.  Through a catalog of events he begins to make serious changes, starting with his growing infatuation with his daughters cheerleading friend Angela.  He begins to work out more, eat better and enjoy a little recreational drug provided by his neighbor's son Ricky.  He quits his job and starts up working at the local burger joint where he can slack off and live life a teenager.  He buys the ridiculously expensive sports car because he wants to and develops an attitude that repels those around him intent on dragging him down.  In essence Lester becomes the man that everyman wishes he could become but lacks the `balls' to do it himself.  Lester is everyman, just pushed to the limit of what any man can take.But this film is far more than just about a single man and his crisis.  Lester's wife Caroline is also going through a bit of a mid-lifer herself.  She's finally come to the realization that she is more than Lester will ever be and she wants, no she needs someone that's a better fit for her.  Lester proves himself a constant embarrassment to her, and his newfound identity is making it difficult for her to function in their life together.  Lester's daughter Jane is pulling away from her parents due to their apparent insanity.  She can't take them anymore, her mothers constant bickering and hysterics, her father's pedophilic lust for her best friend and sudden `cool guy' syndrome.  She distances herself from Angela and forms a closer connection with her neighbor Ricky, a boy who opens her eyes to the real beauty that surrounds her.But both Ricky and Angela themselves offer insight into the growing pandemic surrounding the American public as a whole.  The film effortlessly exposes the common issues that are present in almost every home and exist within almost every human being.  Ricky exists in a household run with a cold fist by his father.  His every move is scrutinized and so he acts out in rebellion by living his life the exact opposite of his father's wishes, albeit behind his back.  Angela is the classic case of girl-hates-self, girl-needs-attention but here she feeds off her characters energy, and most of all Spacey's energy and helps create a character that is in the end so touching and so real.  Her final confrontation with Jane and Ricky is so heartbreaking and her feeling of rejection from Lester is so real.  I actually was moved by her character almost as much as Spacey's.The entire cast, not just Spacey, pull out all the stops here.  Annette Bening is flawless as Lester's controlling and hysterical wife (and I mean hysterical in both of its forms, both hilarious when needed and outrageously dramatic when needed).  Thora Birch is also dynamic as Jane, and Wes Bently brilliantly captures his characters unique outlook at adolescence.  Mena Suvari though really stood out for me as Angela, as did Chris Cooper who plays the domineering and controlling father effortlessly.  Peter Gallagher also develops a nice supporting character, although he comes off more as a cameo, and that's hard for me to acknowledge since under normal circumstances I find him nauseating.  Here though he is fantastic, both charming and endearing while equally repulsive and condescending.  How he manages to pull that off is beyond me.  Each and every actor here benefits greatly from the brilliant script, that's for sure.So, in closing, `American Beauty' is everything that is beautiful about American cinema.  It's engrossing, entertaining, refreshing but most of all moving and emotionally investing.  I often battle my feelings about Spacey's win only because the competition that year was so steep and I feel Crowe gave the performance of a career, but every time I watch this brilliant film I'm reminded of why he deserved his win.  He was so invested, so grounded in Lester that he created one of the most likable sinners of all time, a man who we grew to love and embrace despite his faults.  `American Beauty' will always be one of the most deserving Oscar winners to date and will be remembered every time we look in the mirror.	5.0	Truly beautiful in an alarmingly tragic way...	2007-08-02	4	4	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A24GGDB93HYW31	Andrew Koch	"*AMERICAN BEAUTYLester Burnham: Kevin SpaceyCarolyn Burnham: Annette BeningJane Burnham: Thora BirchRicky Fitts: Wes BentleyAngela Hayes: Mena SuvariDirected by Sam Mendes/ Written by Alan Ball/ 120 minutes (Rated R)BY ANDREW KOCHBeauty: The quality that gives pleasure to the mind or senses and is associated with such properties as harmony of form or color, excellence of artistry, truthfulness, and originality. Although, society has put this definite and limited meaning into beauty, realistically beauty is indefinable. The simple fact that something is beautiful to one person yet ugly and ordinary to another makes it such an abstract concept. Yet, what is finite about is beauty is the idea that society tends to make a mold of beauty. This cast that is produced is the cause of much ""shaping"" towards an ideological goal and is the cause of much internal and external conflict between people, institutions and entities of all sorts.In, ""American Beauty"" the theme of beauty is deeply rooted throughout the movie. The scenes switch frequently from character to character, through which we are introduced to and dig deep within each character's conflict in beauty. Angela, who represents superficial and exterior beauty, directly strives for her society's ideologicalconcept of beauty. To her, beauty is what everyone else tells her and what she sees on the cover of Maxim Magazine. Conversely, Jane Burnham represents the inner beauty within the characters of the movie. Genuine, open, loving, independent and not ready to follow society's guidelines on beauty. She does and wears what she feels comfortable in. Her personality and behavior represent this inner and innocent beauty not found often in ""American Beauty"". To Carolyn Burnham, beauty lies in the way she seems to all others whom view her (society or her friends and family). The illusion of ""happiness, a successful job and being a perfect wife/ mother type"" makes her feel comfortable that people view her as a beautiful person. As society shapes, views and impresses upon the character's beauty and concept of beauty, there exists one character independent of this obligation. He watches and judges beauty, of the women in particular, because it brings him a sense of inner peace. Ricky is independent of the judgmental societal panoptican (all seeing and always watching). He becomes a significant silent and panoptical entity himself in the movie. Whenever shown in the movie, he has his camera and is taping/ observing the beauty of women to things like the wind-carrying bag through the air.The movie ""American Beauty"" is more than just another ""black comedy"" or typical Hollywood film. It moves past the portrayal of beauty through images, actions and looks. It explores and critiques the modern stereotype of what beauty is in women of today. It also explores the interactions and conflicts that arise within the clashing of different ideas of beauty between characters. More importantly, it forces the viewers to reflect upon the idea of inner/ physical beauty and how others view it, themselves and society as a whole."	5.0	CINE 285k- IMOS- American Beauty	2004-05-12	4	2	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A25BZHDKHNGD1D	Angelica C. Driskell	American citizens are granted certain &#8220;unalienable rights&#8221; under the United States Declaration of Independence, which include &#8220;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&#8221; (US 1776).  Although this may be a common theme in many dramas, Sam Mendes&#8217; American Beauty (1990) is unique in the way it focuses on character development and symbolism, rather than portraying a more realistic plot with mainstream leading roles.  Sam Mendes makes his theatrical film directorial debut in this original screenplay written by Alan Ball, which is memorable, impactful and thought provoking.  American Beauty places a metaphorical magnifying glass over a typical suburban, middle-class family and invites us to &#8220;look closer&#8221; at the driving forces behind certain human behavior, while in pursuit of the American dream.  Sam Mendes delivers a beautiful piece of work with a meaningful ending.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) catches our attention from the start by announcing &#8220;I am 42 years old; in less than a year I will be dead&#8230;and in a way, I am dead already&#8221; (American Beauty).  Lester&#8217;s wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is a career-driven, perfectionist, obsessed with material possessions, who believes &#8220;in order to be successful, one must project an image of success at all times&#8221; (American Beauty).  Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) is an only child struggling with self-discovery in contrast to her egocentric best friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), who exudes a false sense of security and sexual bravado.  Outwardly, the Burnham&#8217;s appear to be the perfect American family; however, a closer look reveals complete dysfunction and desperation.  Ironically, the Burnham&#8217;s neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), is a socially awkward teenager living with a militant father, and catatonic mother, who supports his amateur filmmaking hobby by dealing drugs.  Despite the chaos in Ricky&#8217;s life, he accepts things as they are and has the ability to look beyond superficial appearances.  Ricky recognizes true beauty in the world that most people overlook, such as a plastic bag dancing in the wind or the peaceful serenity of a dead bird lying on the ground.  Ricky reminds Lester to &#8220;never underestimate the power of denial,&#8221; meaning it&#8217;s easier to see things the way in which one wants to see them, rather than seeing the truth (American Beauty).Mendes uses beautiful cinematography including interesting color composition, lighting, and camera angles to develop the film and highlight the relationships between each character and within themselves.  The opening aerial shot of a typical suburban neighborhood, with rows of identical houses, alludes to feelings of apathy expressed by Lester.  Overhead shots used throughout the film allow the audience to see things through God&#8217;s eyes.  Wide-angle shots at the Burnham dinner table show the distance between Lester and Carolyn, as they sit on opposite sides of the frame, with Jane caught in the middle.  Close-up shots are used to emphasize character emotions, such as Carolyn&#8217;s feeling of failure during an emotional breakdown when she literally beats herself up or Jane&#8217;s peaceful smile every time Ricky shows her interest.  Additionally, cheerful family photos are shown between scenes of family dysfunction, which implies that looks can be deceiving.  Mendes also uses soft lighting and muted colors in Lester&#8217;s fantasies about Angela, except for the rich saturation of red rose petals, which exemplifies the serenity he feels in the moment.  In the final scene, the camera pans left to right, in a seamless transition, to capture each character&#8217;s reaction to the current situation.Mendes also employs the use of symbolism in subtle ways that pervade the film.  The colors red, white and blue are displayed in clothing, decor and props, which symbolize American ideology.  This theme is most evident in Burnham&#8217;s white house with a red door and blue shutters.  Additionally, the color red is used to represent love, lust and passion.  Deeply saturated contrasting colors of red and blue reflect the deeply saturated and contrasting emotions of the characters.  Carolyn is frequently portrayed in red, while Lester is portrayed in blue to emphasize their opposition of one another.  Red roses are used in the opening scene, with Carolyn trimming the stems, and also found throughout the Burnham&#8217;s house.  The rose is a symbol of love and beauty, while the thorns remind us that love is painful.  Rose petals are used in Lester&#8217;s fantasies, which add a cerebral perspective and gives deeper meaning to the film.  The rose petals become a soft landing place for his subconscious mind, which can be seen from the moment Lester lays eyes on Angela and flood of rose petals flow out of her sweater.  Lester also pulls a rose petal out of his mouth after his illusionary kiss with Angela.  These petals symbolize his new found passion for life and are prominent in each of Lester&#8217;s fantasies.American Beauty is an American tragedy in which each character suffers in some way due to a tragic flaw, moral weakness, or inability to cope with their circumstances.  The multi-dimensional cast of characters intrigues the audience with their cathartic performances that viewers can identify with and have a restoring emotional experience.  Lester&#8217;s poignant reflection of life after death successfully conveys the theme to the audience.  Lying peacefully in a crimson pool of blood, Lester reminds us that &#8220;there's so much beauty in the world,&#8221; we should feel grateful for every single moment of life no matter how stupid it seems (American Beauty).  Mendes does a wonderful job of keeping the focus on life rather than death, which has a greater impact on the viewing experience.Works CitedAmerican Beauty. Dir. Sam Mendes. DreamWorks, 1999.

The fact that this movie got an Academy Award is an indicator of the degradation of society.  In fact, the only difference between this movie and Jerry Springer is that it did get an academy award.  Even on Jerry Springer atleast their is honesty, they confront their problems.

It's so well focussed on some people in America, their day to day life, the emotions, the feelings are all genuine and you actually feel you are meeting a family next door. Kevin Spacey is impeccable, makes it totally believable in the charecter of 'Lester Burnham', his wife played by Annette Benning was simply amazing, so was Thora Birch as his daughter. An excellent cast-chemistry and the flow of the film goes on pretty well. Almost everyone delivers a wonderful performence, its erotic, its hot, its fabulous, its decent and most of all genuine.

Some people commented in their reviews that the characters are all steriotypes, but I think the main point  was to show that in the past twenty years we have oversimplified and become  parodies of ourselves. All of the performances in this movie are equally  fantastic and believable. The plot is intricate and simple at the same  time. Whether you love it or hate it, American Beauty is a &quot;must  see&quot;! For those who enjoy this movie, I suggest &quot;Ordinary  People&quot;, the 1980 Oscar winner for best picture and predecessor for  American Beauty.	5.0	American Beauty is a film you won't forget!	2000-07-14	8	5	3

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A36XKQIVU76LFC	Anthony Gulyas	"Wow... this film which I just finished watching, made quit a big impact on me. As one other reviewer had quoted in this list, he expected another typical hollywood run of the mill film, but this is far from that. No this film addresses so many issues, on so many different levels, and so many different important topics. The characters in it are all very engaging, and emotionally involving, that its hard not to get lost in the film. While watching the film, I couldn't help but wonder where exactly I was being led, but as the plot unfolds, you are more than abundantly made aware of what exactly dysfunctional family life in america is all about today. The thing is though, if this film was just about a candid camera type view into a dysfunctional family, as in such a movie as ""Ordinary People"", it could be dismissed as just another psychological melodrama, but it is much more than that. It is about these very peoples survival skils and how they cope with situation of waking up to the fact that the American Dream did not work out for them. Although Lester is the key character that the drama unfolds around, I personally found the guy next door filming everything (the soldiers son), the one I personally identified with the most. He is the one who shows his films to Jane, to explain to her what true beauty is. At that point, there is a turning point in the film, as Jane who epitomized ugliness and self rejection to me, begins to wake up to her own beauty and self worth. Poor Lester though, he is the hero in the film, the survivor who triumphs, but doesnt live long enough to fully enjoy the beauty he discovered late in life. If none of this makes sense what I am saying here, SEE THE FILM, then will understand what I am talking about. Yep, there is every kind of topic dealt with in this film, from sexuality, to drugs, to failing marriage, on and on.wow, all I can say is.. amazing job Kevin Spacey.. Kudos to you on such great acting."	5.0	Dysfunctional America	2003-11-15	4	2	2

If you view the world though rose tinted spectacles you probably wouldn't like this movie.  This is disconcerting view of the world - how things are when you look just a little closer.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2Z379ES750ZRY	Anton Karidian	Here is a film in which the members of The Academy clearly jumped on the band wagon and voted it a great film without justice.  Although the movie suggest layers profund meaning (e.g. beauty in the ordinary) there isn't anything in this movie that hasn't been explored before.  Infact many of the themes have been explored to death (i.e. mid-life crises of a typical American guy).In the commentary track -- available on dvd the director and producer &quot;ooh and ahhh&quot; about how great the slow pan of the camera or how cleverly they &quot;cage&quot; the protagonist (Keven Spacey) behind the spreadsheet on the computer monitor -- oh how deep!....Big deal.This movie is nothing more than a made for tv movie with a made for tv story.  It's the sort of movie that a group of friends will walk out of the theatre, not knowing what to think so instead every just says how great it is...for fear of &quot;not  GETTING it&quot;.  The truth of the matter is there IS NOTHING TO it.  Don't be fooled.This film is an insult to the great films that preceded it.	1.0	Don't be fooled	2000-11-07	33	15	18
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1X7Z57YMYGUU6	Arch Stanton	"""American Beauty"" is yet another Hollywood ""film"" that hasn't the slightest respect for decency or verisimilitude.  Outside of the demented imaginations of liberal pinko prevert screenwriters there is no allusion to contextual rectitude. (Thanks for the commentary guys.)  Let's just take a look at the sordid view of our society that this movie propagates.  They expect us to actually believe in: greedy, amoral, meglomaniacal real estate agents trouncing through suburbia like hyenas in heat; precociously neurotic high school kids swearing, selling drugs to each other and obsessing over forbidden sex; disillusioned, middle-aged men fantasizing about over-sexed, buffed out teenage girls; decent and intelligent gay men trying to get along with their neighbors; fascistic, closet-case marine corps officers abusing their wives and children; and finally, the offspring of decadent, pathologically materialistic, dysfunctional, middle class parents dreaming of a world without hypocrisy and social Darwinist oppression.  I mean, ask yourself, honestly:  IN WHAT KIND OF UNIVERSE DO THESE THINGS HAPPEN?!!!On second thought, don't ask yourself.  American film has been on the highway to hell ever since Orson Welles threw a fish in the face of wholesomeness in ""Citizen Kane"" when he uttered that infamous lewd and suggestive catch phrase, ""Rosebud.""  Movies have been going downhill ever since."	5.0	Completely out of touch with reality	2002-02-16	15	3	12
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2Q23PXB7IW6F1	A reader	"I am dismayed to see how beloved this movie is (and mortified that most of the negative reviews focus mainly on the quality of the product, not on the film itself, though that of course is a legitimate thing to complain about).  I give it two stars and not one because it IS a well-made film.  The acting is strong and the director clearly had a vision.Now the bad news.  I find nothing, NOTHING profound or insightful or moving about this film. As another reviewer pointed out, is it really new news that the pursuit of the so-called American dream is shallow and unfulfilling?  Is it really a revelation that if you took a glimpse inside a seemingly perfect American household you'd find a lot of shocking things?  And the solution -- that we should take time to enjoy life and its little moments of beauty ... really?[Note: the following contains some spoilers]Hollywood and the movie-viewing public love movies in which wealthy people are unhappy and can only find happiness by shunning their materialism.  This makes us all feel better:  people who aren't as wealthy as the family portrayed here (which is most of America and most of the movie-watching public) can feel good in knowing that it's OK that they struggle to make ends meet, because, hey, it's better than being rich!  It's the same fake-populist message moviemakers have been throwing at us for decades, and people eat it right up, somehow believing that the family in this movie is ""just like us.""  I doubt that.What's more, again as another reviewer pointed out, this movie should have been titled ""American White Wealthy Straight Male Fantasy.""  This is one of the most misogynistic movies I've seen in years.  Annette Benning should have won the Oscar just for being a good sport in allowing her character to be portrayed in a spectacularly unflattering way.  The ambitious middle-aged career woman is portrayed as a monster, while her daughter is portrayed as more of a female ideal. Why? She falls in love with the boy next door, whom others think is creepy but of course she sees through that and allows him to watch and film her disrobe.  How good of her to enjoy being objectified.  When they agree to run away, she sweetly offers the small amount of money she's saved up.  He smiles protectively and says that's OK, he's made enough money selling drugs to take care of the both of them.  Enlightened viewers are supposed to go along with this and think it's cool and delightfully subversive that he's a drug dealer, and if you have a problem with that you're too morally upright because who is he harming?  Uh, how about all those people who are killed during drug trafficking?  But that's OK, because it's more important that these uptight, angst-ridden American suburbanites are able to cut loose and get high.And then there's the dreadful cliche of the ""bad guy"" of the film being a repressed homosexual.  The film wants to show how enlightened and tolerant it is by having a nice gay couple in it and having the Spacey character befriend them.  But including this stereotype subtley suggests that homosexuality is shameful and messes with your head.  I know this was unintentional, but if you're going to make a film that's Oscar-worthy, you can't be that sloppy.I could go on but have gone on too far already, especially since I know all this will fall on deaf ears.  Make a beautiful-looking movie, cast great actors, and make it seem like you're revealing something profound when you're really just slinging the same tired message that is so comforting to audiences -- badaboom badabing, award-winning success."	2.0	disappointing, both the film and the response to it	2012-05-27	10	2	8

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ATXO4UA7N1HDC	Ari Weiss	American Beauty: rated R, 1 hour and 58 minutesAmerican Beauty is Spacey at his best...again, but wait, there's more. This time, a team of actors and actresses that nearly show him up accompany Spacey. A true movie ensemble including Annette Benning, Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley threaten to steal the spotlight.A seemingly typical suburban neighborhood gets an in-depth look beneath the shallow surface. An ordinary, financially well-to-do family is followed through the point of view of the father (extraordinary Kevin Spacey). He narrates his life and fills the audience in on all of his quirks, flaws, and limitations, as well as those of his wife (Annette Benning), and daughter (Thora Birch). These introductory moments in which Spacey reveals a side of his family that no one in the neighborhood dare discover are executed with a touch of comical ingenuity. To glance beyond this comical absurdity exposes a miserable, dysfunctional, household with no escape from their perpetual sorrows. When the movie is seen through this perspective, it loses its humor, but picks up a deeper, more real meaning. This double angle that persists throughout the movie is one of the elements that make this movie so brilliantly interesting. To reassess the movie allows the deeper, more serious meaning to become more prominent, but while watching in the moment, laughter is most likely to be the initial overwhelming response. The movie is incredibly unique in its entire concept. It is so clever, serious, and funny all in one. No other movie has risked implementing such an unlikely combination. The result is absolute, inarguable success.American Beauty deals with the true nature of life, attempting to enlighten its viewers, by doing so in a charming, eloquent manner, as opposed to shoving it down our throats. `What is beauty?' is the question that this movie raises. Is it found in a nice looking house, a good-natured person, a flower, a gorgeous woman, or is it more abstract than that? What if beauty was found in exceptional circumstances that cannot be reasonably accounted for, or what if it were merely in understanding? All of these ideas are aroused; none are straightforwardly answered, though one theory that seems to come across clearly is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Every moment of every scene enacted in American Beauty is done with such precision and vitality, that they all become memorable without exception. The characters are all well developed. More interestingly, each character is severely flawed, some more than others, but each is forced to account for these flaws. The character of Kevin Spacey, Lester Burnham is one of great complexity, as are most in the movie. Lester has just decided that he would like to do more with his pathetic life than laze around and remain to be pathetic for eternity. He revives a suppressed, vivacious identity that he soon embraces. With this new livelihood, comes a price. His wife and daughter who have grown exceedingly distant through the years are not ready to take on a whole new Lester Burnham.To say that American Beauty exhibited superb acting throughout would be a major understatement. Kevin Spacey was utterly astonishing in his ability to convey the character of Lester Burnham. Annette Benning as Lester's wife, Carolyn Burnham was as she has never been seen before. In comparison to her flaky, overdone role in The Siege, she seemed to have undergone some sort of miraculous endowment of acting skill, as well as passion for her part. She worked beautifully with Spacey, as did the daughter, Thora Birch, and the rest of the crew. No one was really better than anyone else because each actor played his role with such grace and dignity that none can be considered second-rate. The rest of the credit is awarded to first-time feature film director Sam Mendes who envisioned the entire film. It was he who set the mood, worked on the unique camera angles, informed all of the actors of how there characters were to be projected, and it was he who incorporated all of the minute fine points into a giant masterpiece.No complaints can be made of the unblemished American Beauty. It deserves Oscar attention to the highest degree.	5.0	What Lies Beneath The Surface	2001-09-22	4	3	1

Mesa	I knew this film was going to be Oscar material when the lady sitting behind me in the theatre walked out in disgust due to the opening shower scene.The second clue was another lady who sat through the two hours plus  and was crying after the tragic finale ! This film (almost like no other)  has evoked various emotional responses in different people on all different  levels . This is the kind of writing and directing that is so profound it  leaves the viewer in almost a dazed state of awe. A film that can contain a  strong element of dark humor and biting sarcasm along with drama and  tragedy is a rare gem; American Beauty is this gem ! The reasons why some  viewers found this film so offensive was beacuse it either hit too close to  home or they have never come across anyone in their lives who were as human  as these characters. Just because the Joneses or the Smiths next door have  the &quot;American Dream&quot; does not mean that there were not certain  &quot;sacrifices&quot; made to achieve that dream. In other words, what  lengths do we as an American society go to to achieve the ideal American  financial and perfect family status. There is a difference between  sacrificing free weekends for overtime at a job to send your kids to  college versus sacrificing your morals or your mother to spite a famiy  member or acquaintance.The only other tongue-in-cheek message American  Beauty may emit is maybe we shouldn't get too friendly with our neighbors  !...As for the abundance and wealth of talent, Spacey, Benning, and  Birch are the film's treasures as well.

This film is a depressing story about sick, dysfunctional people and their ways of coping. Is there anything uplifting about it? Not that I can see. Do we really need to see a movie featuring:The father (Lester) lusts and fantasizes over his daughter's teenage friend;The friend (Angela) talks using the raunchiest language imaginable;The neighbor is a drug dealer who is beaten by his own dad, sells to Lester and has a voyeuristic fetish with his video camera;The wife has an affair with a rival business owner and ultimately murders her husband.These people and their real-life counterparts need the gospel message of Jesus Christ.

I had a chance to watch DVD version of the movie recently and its never boring rather, I find it more thoughful.No doubt - this is Kevin Spacey's best. Lot of venueus for exhibiting his acting skills. So many to point out - while at the fast food drive through meeting his wife with her boy friend, while clarifying the neighbor that he is not 'that', while talking to her daughter's friend after the game, and the best of all, while hearing that it is her first time. I don't see Kevin in the movie but Lester himself. He has lived the character. Class of acting! The Oscar he got was well acclaimed!Interestingly most of the crew in the movie have excellently acted - be it her daughter or wife or the neighbor or neighbor's father.There is enough fun in the movie - the dialogue commenting the two partners jogging with his neighbor is one best example. Cinematography - another wonder in the movie. The flying dirt bag shot by the boy is a beautiful poem of its own. Dialogues, Direction, Screenplay, Story - everything deservers appreciation - Flawless.If at all critics complain about too much of reality or too much of abnormal characters in the movie - well! life is not normal always. Not everyone is perfect! And everyone with our own idiosyncrasies. But inside, the movie is very deep and requires varied serious thoughts.And we cannot forget the silent serious and thoughtful emotion existing throughout the movie.

Also, are we to think that Kevin Spacey's character WOULD have had sex with an underage girl had he NOT found out she was a virgin???  This point is completely ignored and, upon reflection, takes some of the movie's luster away.  However, I found the movie to be great nonetheless.

I have never seen such a lack of respect in a family establishment as has been presented in this movie. But maybe it is the complete disregard for all standard family values that makes this flick so damn good! Issues such as infidelity, homophobia, petafiles, premarital relations, and dilusional parents are addressed in this film with the notion that life as a teen ager is dark and cynical. I loved the way the father was so sarcastic to the mother and did not take any of her bull. His character made such a one eighty it was unrealistic (but hey thats a movie for you) and, his charactor, dispite being the narrator, was the most importat character. He initiated the conflict between himself and his daughter Jainie, and he continued the upserd relationship with his wife.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A25HGE33DHVLWD	Ashley	"American Beauty A Review by Ashley McBrideThroughout the film, the main question of ""what is beauty"" is prevalent. There are many answers that are offered throughout the course of the film, but what stands out the most is not the typical superficial answer offered by most Hollywood pictures.Lester, the main character of the film whose life we as viewers follow undergoes a midlife crisis.  The monotony of everyday life is unrelenting and causing complete atrophy of his potential as a human being.  This is until he meets Angela the Hollywood answer to beautiful women, and a friend of his daughter Jane.  To Lester, Angela is all that represents beauty.  Ricky, a neighbor boy, develops a different definition of beauty; with his camera he can see the world in a different way.  He falls in love with Jane, a less stereotypical beauty but a more genuine person.  All the while, Carolyn, Lester's wife, Jane's mother, thinks success is the answer to finding beauty.  The substance of the plot is that before Lester dies, he is released from an insipid monotonous life and gets to experience his life's beauty to the fullest in his last year-though it is tragic he dies after he has just found beauty.Some common stereotypes are broken in this film.  For example, the fact that physical beauty comes second to internal beauty.  This is shown in the film by the fact that we are unable to really accept Angela as beautiful because of her misleading and overall repulsive personality-though she is physically very pretty.  This film challenges the viewer (with a series of disassociative affects i.e. rose pedals, hallucinations, overacting, Ricky's films) to look closer than the surface to find the fundamental truth, and thus beauty, within.  The film does not give an exact answer to what is beautiful-that is left for the viewer to do, which invites the viewer to look more closely at life and to think.Women are objectified in this film because they are examples of separate incidences of beauty.  Carolyn always wears a faade (which we see break down at the house she is trying to sell) and will do anything to appear successful to those who are viewing her (this is why she closes the blinds before she breaks down).  Jane is objectified through Ricky's camera, he is always filming her and through his film, we see a side of Jane that is genuine and beautiful.  Angela is viewed by Lester and acts accordingly, because she likes to be objectified and watched.  Throughout the film, women are viewed through the lenses of men-and they, in turn, internalize this panopticon in the way that they act and thus appear.This film intersects aspects of race, social and economic class-the families we view are Middle American, middle class, middle management (and our main character Lester is middle aged).  This encompasses a broad range of people who can therefore identify with the film as ""normal,"" until they disassociate due to cinematic effects and critique the characters repute with the intensification of the film.  Through the challenge of the film (tag line: ""...look closer"") we see that we can find our own beauty, and not simply commodify the beauty forced on us by other Hollywood films."	5.0	American Beauty a Review by A.McBride	2004-05-11	4	4	0

A masterpiece that touches you wherever you are.. Not just in America.. And thats why its not just an American Beauty.. This is the movie you will  watch and no matter where you are on this planet, you will still be able to  relate. What made this more possible is the genuis script and how it was  written, the incredible way it was directed and the outstanding acting from  everyone who appeared on screen even for seconds. Kevin Spacey is one hell  of an actor who played a very difficult role and mastered it as if he has  been living it for the past 40 years. Kevin, you were incredible. Annette  Bening has managed to make everyone resents her. Doesn't this say how  masterful she was? I can go on forever. Everyone in this movie has  contributed significantly to the enjoyment each one of us in the movie  theatre was feeling. I watched it yesterday, will watch it again today and  I am sure I will go again and again. I am just sitting here waiting to see  how the Acadamy will rate this movie... whether it will touch every judge's  life the same way it touched the lives of all those who have seen it.  Please Hollywood, indulge us more with such sensations.	5.0	Not just an American Beauty	2000-03-03	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2WN6UJP3KUDRH	Astrid Slomova	On first viewing, I knew absolutely nothing about this film.  I am glad for that.  This is one of those movies that draws one into a journey filled with unexpected twists and turns.  I understand that this was Alan Ball's first film script.  Most impressive.Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham and is the anchor of the story.  However, all of the other central characters are extremely well-developed--and terribly interesting.  It might be a bit cynical, but there seem to be quite a number of people who can actually identify with the story and characters.  Not the typical &quot;feel-good&quot; movie, to be sure.  But it is a compelling one.The performances are likewise deep and true.  The bottom line is that I cannot say enough good things about this film.  In fact, even though I own the DVD, whenever a cable network airs it, I find myself watching.  I always find something new.Get this one.  If you like movies, you'll love it.	5.0	Never Underestimate the Power of Denial	2001-05-31	5	0	5

I think that most take things too literal and don't realize and appreciate a good metaphor. The only minor quibble I have is that of Chris Cooper's character being a latent homosexual (too stereotypical and played like revenge...), but it didn't detract from this great film, in my opinion.I suspected from outset that there would be many who would hate this film and consider it trash. Unfortunately, there are too many of us who expect to just sit back and be entertained. And when a film comes along that forces us to examine ourselves we balk. Alan Ball said it best when he stated that we spend most of our lives thinking about life and our personal situation, yet few films ever get made that do that. Too bad. The masses get their &quot;Independance Day&quot; fodder and the few of us, who get it, will take films like &quot;American Beauty,&quot; as a testament of the real independance!	5.0	Not surprising	2001-03-03	1	0	1

You then hear that his daughter  is discussing getting someone to kill him.  Great set up for a movie.  With that framework the fun begins.Kevin Spacey is a salesman in a  company like most that is going through the gauntlet of re-organization.  He is asked by a corporate hired &quot;efficiency expert&quot; to write his  own job description.  Many of us in corporate America know this is a  two-edged sword.  Make it good enough and you will eliminate a co-worker.  Make it not good enough and eliminate yourself.  Of course the efficiency  expert, is new to the company and has little respect for loyalty and past  successes.Kevin's screen wife is Annette Bening, she is a plastic  suburban real estate agent.  The world doesn't meet her standard's so she  left it long ago to become Martha Stewart.  Every now and then the cracks  show through and she does a wonderful scene demonstrating that.Their  daughter is the typical teenager, has everything, and hates the people that  provided it.  Especially her father, who walks on egg-shells at home, to  keep from bursting his plastic wife's bubble.Their neighbors are  perfect.  On one side we have the 90's gay couple trying to be the perfect  neighbors and fitting in with typical suburban life.  On the other side  the newcomers, they have a military type father, that is so anti-gay it is  a cartoon.  His son is apparently recently returned from a drug  rehab-psych. ward.  The military guy's wife looks like she is treading a  thin line between father and son.  Ironically, the son is the saner of the  three of them.With all this in mind Kevin Spacey coping with potential  job cuts, his wife dealing with a highly competitive California real estate  market and the daughter going through the trauma of a teenager, you have a  situation ripe for one of them to blow.Pretty much they all do.Kevin  Spacey meets the new neighbors, the neighbors meet each other.  Remember  the anti-gay military guy and the suburban gay couple.  You can figure the  rest.Through several incidents, Annette Benings real-estate party, going  to the daughters game at school, a rough real estate showing things start  to twist around.Kevin Spacey is inspired to hand in the job  description that we would love to give to the &quot;efficiency&quot;  expert, but ties it up with a golden parachute that allows him to pursue  other interests.  He also decides he is entirely smitten with his  daughter's vapid best friend.  (It is amazing some of the comments this  best friend makes.) His wife in &quot;awe-inspired&quot; bliss and over  frustration of her husband's new attitude takes off on a new venture  herself.  (Hey, I don't want to tell you everything).The daughter in the  mean time discovers the next door neighbor isn't so bad after all, and ends  up with him.While things all seem to be headed down the path of new  alliances, through some mistaken assumptions and incredibly bad timing a  bomb that is about to go off gets it's fuse lit.  You can see it coming.  The problem is you don't know from which direction.No, I'm not going to  tell you what happened.  You really have to see the movie to appreciate the  timing and the build up.How many people are going to see themselves in  this movie?	5.0	Phenomenal and Jaded	2000-08-02	1	1	0

Notice how all of the characters display no evidence of a social group? That's impossible given how they conduct their business, and then, therefore, that is what makes the outcomes of the film impossible. American Beauty is a simple play of manipulations on the audience's thinking that people are that simple and their goals are that simple. Unfortunately, people in reality are not that shallow or everything they seem to be. And seeing the ending, I don't think so either.

It has a nice touch of dark comedy that is quite good, but, there's just something that makes this movie viewable more than once. Kevin Spacey plays a middle aged suburban dad who goes through one hell of a midlife crisis. He quits his job and starts to fall for his daughter's cheerleader girlfriend. Annette Bening plays his harried wife. The actors are all really, really good. Spacey is phenomenal. But, the ending, I don't want to go there. This is a movie that a lot of people are not going to get or will want to watch at all. They should see it at least once.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1XNXHTPQRACRO	Barry C. Chow	"What drives me nuts about this piece of snot--what gets my blood really boiling--is the way it deconstructs what are essentially Hollywood sins and then has the brazen gall to attribute them to suburbia. It's the Champagne set snickering at the yokels with slick condescension: ""We also may lust after young flesh, pursue gross materialism and sell out to superficiality, but we are among the chosen elite and do it with so much more style that we are entitled to our vapidity.""I dare Hollywood to show me a better example of what it is that this flick purports to deplore than the behaviour of their own mewling overpaid oversexed self-worshipping stars. ""Hypocrisy"" doesn't cover it; the word ""atrocity"" comes close. Out-of-control mid-life crisis? Hollywood. Nubile young goddesses with trash mouths? Hollywood. Arrested adolescence? Hollywood. Manic materialism? Hollywood. Self-absorption? Hollywood. It beggars belief how many thinking people have been hoodwinked into going along with this perversion of reality.This flick stands as a shining example of everything that is wrong with modern cinema. It is sanctimonious, stereotypical, pretentious, derivative, trivial, dishonest and phoney. Ohhh, let me count the ways:Sanctimony--Annette Benning plays Carolyn Burnham, a grotesque parody of a domestic diva. She is a Stepford Wife run amok: so driven by appearances that she sells her soul to bourgeois hell. This flick wants to tell us that it is doing us a favour shoving its distorted mirror in our face. What a vile insult.Stereotyping--A poor misunderstood dork has a father: who doesn't understand him; who is a sadist; who is a neo-nazi; who is a homophobe; who is a closet GAY sadistic neo-nazi homophobe; who is--gasp--a marine colonel. Why not also show him making blood sacrifices on a pentacle by the moonlight?Pretension--""Beauty is not to be found in the perfect curves of a teenage goddess. Turn and look where you least expect to find it. See the plastic bag floating in the breeze?"" In the context of a better movie, this might have amounted to something. Here, this film's tin-sentiment paper-thin superficiality just underscores the imagery's wretchedness.Derivation--From ""Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"" to ""Pleasantville"" to ""Edward Scissorhands"", the supposed emotional bankruptcy of suburbia has been picked to complete and utter death. As targets go, it would be more challenging to hit the broadside of a barn.Triviality--A man does not have the maturity to find the answers to the big questions in life by looking within himself. Instead, he blackmails his employer, lusts after a cheerleader, gets a McJob, gets high, gets a muscle car and gets dead. We are given to understand that this is terribly profound.Dishonesty--The catering budget alone for this pestilent excretion exceeded what any suburbanite could hope to spend on a lifetime of redecorating, self-absorption and mid-life splurges. I wonder how much Kevin Spacey got paid. Hypocrisy, thy name is Hollywood.Phoniness--Why do we need the fiction of an advertising man regressing to adolescence when we can see the real thing shining before us modeled by such luminaries as Jack Nicholson, Madonna and Cher? Muscle cars are, like, so pass&eacute;. Travolta pacified his mid-life crisis with a private jet.There are innumerable examples of good films that challenge us to re-examine our lives. But they do so with grace, with wisdom, and most of all, with humility--none of the smarmy, superior, condescending sanctimony that pervades this flick. Had this obscenity been set in Beverly Hills, with Kevin Spacey playing a director, Annette Benning an actress, Thora Birch their Hollywood brat, and Mena Suvari a rapacious starlet, it would have still stunk out the place. But it would have had the single grace of at least aiming for the right targets."	1.0	Profound? Beautiful?? Honest??? Did we see the same movie???	2004-10-11	86	46	40

From beginning to end I wanted to leave, but kept thinking &quot;well, I'm sure some good will come out of this movie&quot; (none did). Yes-the acting and directing was supurb and phenominal, but the content was filthy! This screams American trash, garbage, and filth all rolled into one! Before I go on I'd like to say happy for those who liked this film and they are entitled to their opinions. And if you have seen this, or going to see this because your favorite actor, director or producer was apart of it, hey, the more power to you. Located in the rich suberbs, Kevin spacey stars as Lester, the husband and father of a disfunctional family, whom from the beginning is masturbating in the shower because his wife is to controoling to be with him. Annette Benning's character is a shallow, phony, snob who ends up cheating on her husband with somebody she works with. Their teenage rebellious daughter sleeps with the neighbor boy who was following them around with a video-camera from the beginning, and she hangs around a filthy-mouthed friend whom the dad tries to sleep with. Then again it was my fault: I didn't know much about the movie, and it was rated &quot;R&quot; so I should have known better. If you want to see it, borrow it from somebody you know, check it out at the library, or rent it. But don't buy it.

That's the irony of it.  Hence, the movie's catch phrase - ""Look closer"".  Obviously, some people can't seem to look any closer than what they immediate see at the surface, so they don't understand.  And not understand is the start of belligerence and negativity.  The thing that was innovative about this was the positive message it was trying to send to everyone who watched it, ""Do what makes you happy.  There is always enough time left in your life.  There is always a chance.""  Kevin Spacey quit his job, in which he was a silent tool used for years, and he did it in a way where he still had a year's worth of pay.  It's realistic that he didn't immediately run out of money.  And to whomever thinks the point of this movie was to say something along the lines of ""Teens are deep.  Adults are shallow"" was severely mistaken.  The movie was about realization.  The realization that life is beautiful and that life is such a gift, so why waste it on trivial [stuff]?  Do what you feel, whatever makes you happy.  LOOK CLOSER.  I see know why they adopted that catch phrase for the movie, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOOK CLOSER.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AT54Q2ERA4PBR	Ben J Korgen	The casting and acting in this movie are brilliant.  It won five academy awards including Best Picture.  It centers around the superficial outward appearance of beauty and success radiated by an American family of three and the sharply contrasting reality of its inner workings.  An impression left for the viewer's imagination includes the idea that the family once was beautiful and successful, but that the mental state of all three has declined through boredom and other factors to its present dismal state.  The father is Lester (Kevin Spacey) who seems to have lost his moral compass and has adopted the philosophy that nothing really matters.  His wife Carolyn projects the image of being in control of her life, but realizes the warmth in her marriage is gone and she's becoming desperate for meaning.  The daughter is Jane (Thora Birch) whose self esteem is disappearing and believes she's unattractive.  Jane falls in love with neighbor Ricky  (Wes Bently) who sells drugs and wants a career in the movie industry.  Ricky is regularly beaten to a pulp by his super-macho ex-marine father Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper).  Lester falls in love with one of Jane's high school girlfriends, tries to seduce her in his own home and approaches the ultimate success when she panics and triggers a joint freeze-out.  Rick gets sick of his regular beatings and leaves home, taking Jane with him.  Lester is numb from his own experiences when neighbor Colonel Fitts has a meltdown and wanders over to Lester begging for tenderness, hugging and possibly a more intimate relationship.  The movie is loaded with light and dark humor along with significant bursts of total degradation.  Viewers who love dark humor will adore this movie.  Those who wince at the sight of degradation might do well by forgetting it.	5.0	Sam Mendes Directs Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch and Wes Bentley in Great Multi-Layered Movie About America	2013-10-27	4	4	0

However, these are the few elements in the film that actually do impress.The amount of mindless cliches inherent to these characters is appalling.  American Beauty never fails to present people through the looking glass of trendy, political correctness.  Nowhere is this more true than with the gay couple, Jim and Jim.  They are the only normal adults in the movie.  By depicting them as a picture of stability, normality, and kindness, it is apparent, amidst the dysfunctionality everywhere else, that the creators are more concerned with trying to make a positive statement about homosexuality than present a meaningful film.  If all gay men formed the strong bonds these two possess, then there would never be any stigma to homosexuality in the first place.  The fact is that only within the gay male population do you find, when polled, anyone who's ever had 10,000 or more lifetime sexual partners.  Of course such a level of promiscuity is not the norm, but the majority do not live in mansions out in the suburbs with tax attorneys. What we see here, unfortunately, is pure spin.Even worse, and completely inexcusable, is the rendering of the Marine Colonel, Mr. Fitts.  Unlike the role model gay couple who, despite being a statistical abnormality, are actually representative of some gay Americans, I'm willing to bet that the Colonel is like no military man on this earth.  Certainly, he is nothing like any that I have met in my 35 years.  Fitts is an utter fiction produced by the mind of someone who hates this nation and our armed forces.The Colonel's method of leading his family is to beat him son and force him to take semi-annual drug tests.  His wife is even less a real person than he is.  She's a refugee from Valley of the Dolls and has been demoralized to the point of appearing a zombie.  From the moment we encounter Fitts, his accent and style of speech should alert anyone familiar with Hollywood's methods that he will be an example of intolerance.  Whenever one hears rural inflections on the big screen, one must realize that the individual will be endlessly derided by the tofu mandarins who intolerantly judge the rest of us from their perches on the left coast.  After all, in the moviemaker's configuration, only sadistic, close-minded, evil men would ever volunteer to defend the United States in the first place.That they could actually try to pass off this World War I drill master as a Colonel, let alone an actual human being, speaks volumes of how little they know about the armed forces and the disdain they have for the brave individuals who guard us while we sleep.  One cannot avoid having the impression that the director and screenwriter had never previously even met a member of the Marine Corps.The Colonel comes straight (sic) out of the GLSEN handbook for homophobia.  He is a caricature, the type of person ""whose hate will not save him.""  We discover, just as the politically correct manuals would predict, that he himself is secretly gay.  Well, of course he is, isn't everyone who disagrees with gay activists?  His existence is meant to dupe us into thinking that homophobia is not really a hysterical fabrication even though the character they choose to convey this is unquestionably a fabrication.  He is a creation stemming from heterophobia and paranoia in regards to masculinity.  The Colonel would rather kill his own son than allow him be gay which should alert every viewer that the film is utter propaganda  The last thing American Beauty wants to do is say something important about human nature.Just for the record, homosexuality is not something an officer in the Marine Corps would find very earthshaking.  How could he given that the Colonel was immersed in a male only culture for the majority of his professional career?  Fitts probably had to first deal with it a month after his enlistment began.  I bet he would have gotten over its uniqueness by the end of basic training.  We will soon have more opportunities to judge this director's opinions as he has just finished making the film ""Jarhead.""  I have no doubt that in it he  will more fully manufacture negative imagery regarding the world's most selfless soldiers.This horrendous portrait of suburbia never fails to disappoint.  A world that is steeped with narcissism, materialism, and constant sex is definitely an accurate snapshot of the mandarins dwelling in Hollywood, but it has no correlation with the great number of Americans who choose to live outside our major metropolises."	2.0	Zero Beauty.	2005-06-25	35	11	24

Too bad 2000 isn't shaping up as good, let's just hope it gets better.I think that it is a great shame that the DVD version does not offer the alternate ending. This 'alternate ending' was completely different and is said to hold the best bits of Conrad Hall's brilliant cinematography. There must be a strong reason why they didn't keep it, but the viewer must decide which version to see.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2PPUITR9MBY01	Beryl	&quot;American Beauty&quot; exudes so much truth, it's head-turningly  elemental.  Taking what seems to be a drab storyline, the pace and the  approach surprise the audience; we are always with the characters when they  complain about their lives, and we are always with them when they laugh and  smile about their past experiences.  The actors are across-the-cast superb,  especially Kevin Spacey, who makes it seem impossible that Lester Burnham  be played by anyone but him.  While I personally did think that  &quot;American Beauty&quot; was a little overrated (I still haven't figured  out whether it really IS the best of the decade), and it's true that the  Colonel 's role seems only to propel the last act of the movie, that  doesn't change its magic.  It 's an incredily insightful and intelligent  exploration of our daily natures,  and the movie is boundless in nuance and  meaning.  Top it off with an affecting  music score by Thomas Newman (who's  FINALLY getting recognized), and sweeping cinematography, and you get one  of the top picks of 1999.	5.0	Boundless in nuance and meaning	2000-06-18	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AX3T81AX775G3	Bethany McKinney	American Beauty is a perfect movie. Everything about it is astounding. The script and acting are phenomenal. There is not one actor (leading or  supporting) who is not brilliant--and I mean BRILLIANT. It is also  virtually flawless cinematically, and your eyes and ears will love you for  watching it. Watching Lester (Kevin Spacey) transform from a compliant peon  to a person of system-bucking defiance is thoroughly entertaining, and  seeing the relationship develop between Jane and Ricky is a reminder of  what it's like to have your heart engulfed by someone else.So the movie  itself is absolutely PHENOMENAL; but it's disappointing that the DVD does  not include the alternate ending (which focuses on Jane and Ricky after  Lester's murder). It seems likely that it will be released on a later  version, but this movie is SO great, that you may as well have two copies.	5.0	GREAT in All Areas	2000-08-10	2	1	1

It depicts what most teens are going through, though they might take it to the extreme, it does show how many are feeling. American Beauty is also a movie that every middle aged adult should see. I am sure many people go through much of the same things that both parents go through. Again, it might go to the extreme, but that is what  makes this movie worth watching. many themes come through in this story, people dealing with infedelity, homofobia, and going through a mid-life crisis. These are all things that most people deal with at some point in their lives.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ADXY2YKIZSC1G	BHogg	"American Beauty is without a doubt the freshest, funniest, honest, and most insightful film in memory.It tells the story of Lester Burhnam (Kevin Spacey), the seemingly average, suburban man. He has it all; a lovely wife (Annette Benning), a cheerleader daughter(Thora Birch), a job for a major corproration, and a large house. But the film asks us to ""look closer"" and it does just that. We can clearly see that his life, marriage, and relationships are crumbling. He is going through a midlife crisis, wondering what he has done with his life to make it worthwhile. He quits his job and tries to seduce his daughter's best friend (Mena Suvari). The movie desplays not only his struggle, but the struggle of all the supporting character to see the beauty in life.The acting is certainly a standout. Spacey leads a cast that all inhabit their roles to surprising lengths. Each line is said to seeming perfection, and comes across and understandable and believeable.It is the directoral debut for Sam Mendes, who does an astonishingly great job. Each shot seems to have a purpose, and it if facinating to watch their lives intertwine.The screenplay is what makes the film a classic, though. The diolauge is fresh and crisp, while at the same time believeable. It is also incredibly funny and satirical, despite a strong subject matter (a lot of people find it odd that I laughed at a movie about a pedophile).Overall, American Beauty is an example of what happens when everything in a movie is done to perfection. It will become a classic representation of the movies of our generation. See what all the hype is about.It is truly one of the greatest films of our time."	5.0	Nothing Short of a Modern Masterpiece	2005-11-03	7	5	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2906BADVHW7UF	Bill Carey	Or not.- spoiler -I have found that there are two reactions to seeing American Beauty as it was intended:  Either a cathartic revelation or nothing.  Some people see the movie and walk out saying, &quot;Well -  fine.  Funny and a general trashing of modern american suburbia.&quot;  Some people walk out - look at the leaves falling from the trees and say,  &quot;There is beauty in the world - there is hope.&quot;  Beneath the  superficial dissolution of the Burhnam family, American Beauty is about  personal revelation and coming to grips with your place in the world.  What  drives the movie are pairings of characters and the relationship between  them.  Initially the pairs appear to be [Lester and Carolyn], [Jane and  Angela], [The Fitts Family], [The Burhnam Family], and [The Jims].  Of  these groups, only one has a healthy relationship at the onset of the  movie:  the Jims.  The rest of the groups appear to have healthy  relationships, but that &quot;commercial for how normal we are&quot; is  soon shattered.The movie has two climactic scenes.  The video of the bag  dancing in the wind and the final minutes of the movie.  I will not outline  them here for the sake of anyone reading this who has not seen the movie,  suffice it to say that every character in the movie - except Col. Fitts -  comes to a realization, and that realization is perhaps the most powerful  one that can happen to a person.  The revelation is that everywhere - all  around us every minute of every day - there is beauty.  Not the beauty that  is sold by the hollywood peddlers of image and shadowy illusion.  No, we  are suffused in realy beauty every day.  From the clouds to the bag  rustling in the wind to an ant methodically crawling its way along the  window sill to low purr of a well tuned engine, even in the shock and  finality of death - every day there is beauty all around us.  We pass  through our lives rushing headlong from one day to the next one year to the  next never living out the moments in between.  American beauty is about  finding those moments in life that might otherwise go unnoticed and living  them.  Once we realize just how much beauty there is in the world we can  realize that we too are beautiful.  American Beauty is about finding real  life - not a cheap imitation.Many people will see themselves in a  character in the movie - I did - and that is what lends the movie such  great power.  I can empathize with Ricky's struggles and his longing for  beauty in the world.  To these people the movie will be a profound  experience.  To people who do not see themselves in a character - the movie  will have less impact, but is still worth the time to see.Look closer.  Slow down.  Walk somewhere instead of driving.  Go out and watch a sunset  sometime.  There is beauty out there.	5.0	Either a movie that will change the way you look at life...	2000-02-22	25	19	6

In 1999, that film was American Beauty.  It is contains lots of morally charged themes and tangents, but not really that much to say.The story itself starts out in the narrative-from-beyond-the-grave style like Sunset Boulevard, in which Lester (played masterfully by Kevin Spacey) describes his shallow and hopeless existence.  He is stuck in a dead-end job that he hates, his wife is an endlessly perky on the surface (but a vicious gold digger/adulteress beneath) suburban professional mom, his daughter is a sullen loner and he can only find solace from these suburban ills in masturbation.Lester decides that he is ""mad as hell and not going to take it anymore"" and rebels against his shallow and oppresive suburban existence by: quitting his job and blackmailing his boss into giving him a year's pay, smoking pot, lusting after a girl more than half his age (and working out to impress her), buying a fast car without consulting the wife, and taking a fast food job (because it requires the least amount of responsibility).  In other words, he escapes a shallow and oppressive suburban adult existence by reverting to a shallow suburban adolesence.If the quandry that Lester is in doesn't look all that oppresive to people, the writers ratchet up the oppresive quotient by introducing the Marine Corps neighbor: Colonel Fitts.  Fitts is a caricature straight from Hollywood's neurotic suburbia playbook.  (...)  Col. Fitts, along with Lester's wife, are the least satisfying and most stereotypical in the picture.Out of the entire cast Jane (Thora Birch) seems to be the only one who recognizes the symptoms and the correct cure.  She knows that she desperately needs structure in her life and won't find it from her father or her mother (and most likely not her ""beauty"" obssessed boyfriend).Among the muck described above, there are a few bright spots in the film.  Kevin Spacey is frankly riveting as Lester.  Even though the character is essentially a riff on the character he played in The Ref, he still acts with such verve as to truly deserve the academy award that he won for this role.  In fact, I think its primarily because of Spacey's greatness in this role that so many people have given the entire film such effusive praise.  The cinematography and the score are both excellent as well.In conclusion, while I found some of the film to be excellent and beyond compare of most cinematic releases; taken as a whole, I found it to be less-than-satisfying."	3.0	looked closer, not much to see...	2003-12-04	11	6	5

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AE0E6UII0VSZA	Blake Kleiner	&quot;Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it, and my heart is just going to... cave in.&quot; ~Wes Bentley.The first time I saw &quot;American Beauty,&quot; I was five minutes late. I had no idea what I was getting into. All I knew is that the actor who had gotten my attention in such great movies as &quot;The Negotiator&quot; and &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; was in the starring role, and that little kid from &quot;Now and Then&quot; had grown up and was showing off her chest. That was all I knew, all I expected. What I got was something much more than I would've ever expected from any movie: I got a masterpiece of such caliber that it quickly became one of my all-time favorite movies, ranking right alongside &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Army of Darkness.&quot; The movie was like a vacuum that sucked me in from the first frame I laid my eyes on. I laughed my butt off, I was saddened, and I came out of the movie having a completely different perspective on how to live life, because that is what this film is really about: Life. Not so much how to live as how not to live it. We aren't advised to smoke marijuana or develop a crush on our teenage daughter's best friend when we're 42, we aren't advised to have an affair with the local real estate king, we aren't encouraged to film things that are none of our business through our upstairs window, and we aren't encouraged to like or despise homosexuality. We are encouraged, on the other hand, to live life for exactly what it is, not to fake who we are, and to not get so wrapped up in the idea of our own personal success that all other priorities including self and family become less than secondary.Carolyn: Lester, you're gonna spill beer on the couch. Lester: (Stands up, annoyed) So what? It's just a couch! Carolyn: This is a $4000 sofa upholstered in Italian Silk! This is NOT just a couch! Lester: (Picks up a sofa cushion and repeatedly slams it down on the couch in rhythm with his speech) IT'S... JUST... A... COUCH! (Lets go of cushion) This isn't life! (Softer) This is just stuff... and it's become more important to you than living. Well, honey, that's just nuts.The heart of &quot;American Beauty&quot; lies within that simple exchange of dialogue, and you can find evidence of that simple theme underlying every scene in the movie through the symbolism of roses. The many roses in &quot;American Beauty&quot; display a very simple message: Something isn't right. Something is being covered up. The world as we see it right now, while those roses are on the screen, is synthetic. Look for the roses in the movie. They're everywhere. The most obvious placement is the center of the dining table during the first dinner scene, and their absence in the second one, during one of the most kinetically hilarious arguments in cinema history.&quot;Video is a poor excuse, I know... but it helps me remember... I need to remember...&quot; ~Wes Bentley&quot;American Beauty&quot; is a movie to remember. We should all look at the real message of this extraordinary film as one to live by until the day we die. And we should also remember the remarkable performances from Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, the unhappy suburbanite confronting his midlife crisis; Annette Bening as Carolyn Burnham, the success-starved, sexually-frustrated real estate tycoon who begins an affair with Buddy Kane; and the three teenagers, Wes Bentley as the indomitable Ricky Fitts, Thora Birch as the insecure Jane Burnham, and Mena Suvari as the seemingly perfect example of American beauty, Angela Hayes. And the direction by Orson Welles look-alike Sam Mendes, screenplay by Alan Ball, and cinematography by veteran shooter Conrad L. Hall complete the circle of perfection this film has to offer. &quot;American Beauty&quot; was the last masterpiece of the 1990's, and it deserved every Oscar it got, possibly more.	5.0	Tragic and funny ...look closer	2001-03-06	5	2	3

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AO05DTP9GM4B1	B. Murphy	American Beauty is a film about the `typical' American family, with the `typical' husband and wife, daughter, and a white picket fence surrounding a beautiful rose garden. But, as is it stated below the title of the film, we must look closer. Kevin Spacey's character, Lester, is the husband, who works 5 days a week in his cubicle office space, who suddenly comes to a realization that his life as he knows it, isn't what he wants it to be.  His wife, Carolyn, played by Annette Benning, is Lester's wife, who falls asleep as soon as her head hits the pillow, concentrates all of her time being the best at her real estate job, gawking after the `Real Estate King' Buddy Cane. Their daughter, practically ignored by both of them, suffering from lack of self esteem, with a friend who thinks the world of herself. This friend, Angela eventually becomes Lester's obsession. This `typical' beautiful girl, blonde, blue eyes, thin, puts on a front for all the world to see when she's really suffering inside. When a new neighbor moves in, the son of the household, Ricky, develops an interest for the family. He films them, and watches them, this panoptical character, who sees things differently than the others, intriguing the daughter of Lester and Carolyn. But within the family, we see how Lester objectifies Angela, he fantasizes about her, and somehow every fantasy is overflowing with red rose petals. This film however opposes the stereotype that the man of the house runs everything, because in this house the woman puts herself in charge, and pushes everyone under her. She craves power, and high status. Overall the film raises questions about `typical' family life, or anything `typical', and invites you to think about what is really important and beautiful in life.	4.0	American typicality	2004-05-12	2	0	2

Director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Alan Ball, while both new to the screen, make it seem like they've been doing this for years. Titled a black comedy, American Beauty focuses on a middle-aged man going through a mid-life crisis in the middle of his boring life and tries to reinvent himself, so to speak, by setting his eyes on his daughter's best friend. Kevin Spacey, who plays Lester Burnham, is showcased in one of his best roles I have seen him in. Annette Bening, who plays his wife, Carolyn in the film, is also good, but not nearly as good as Spacey's character, who takes the stage throughout the film. Wes Bentley plays Ricky, a character who takes pleasure in Spacey's daughter in the film often by videotaping her. Thora Birch plays Jane, Spacey's daughter in the film with somewhat of a strong performance, as well as Mena Suvari who plays Angela, the girl that Lester lusts over in the film. Chris Cooper plays Colonel Frank Fitts, an ex-marine father who is rigid and harsh throughout. The film flows in a manner that keeps you interested, even though you know right from the beginning how it's going to end.

From cinematography to writing to acting...absolutly superb! The thing that I loved about this movie is that it had an effect on everyone who saw it. Whether it was a good or bad effect was each viewers desicion...but it did leave an effect. So many movies just play things at face value and do not reach into your soul and tell you something about yourself. This movie did this with beauty and ease. Even if you hated this movie...deep down there is something in this movie that made you question how you are living your life. And it's okay for you to let a movie do that to you...please do! If you hated this movie, I plead with you to watch it again. I have seen it 8 times in the theatre's. My thoughts on the movie change with each viewing. I still love it...but for different reasons each time. If all else, see this movie to witness one of the greatest Acting ensembles ever assembled in a movie. Headed by the man himself, Kevin Spacey, this cast takes you on this bumpy emotional rollercoaster ride. If you have already seen the movie...see it again...and this time:Look Closer!	5.0	American Beauty: American Masterpiece	2000-10-02	1	1	0

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3AD38GXRIGFJ4	Brett A. Crystal	All I have to say is that the preview for this movie did it no justice.  American Beauty was incredible, but when I first saw the previews, it looked boring.  This has occured in movies such as Meet Joe Black, The  Devil's Advocate, The Matrix, and especially Fight Club.  Movies like  Battlefield Earth and Star Wars have been hyped up with their sci-fi  previews, but only disappoint with bad plots.  My Formula For A Good Movie  is to make a bad preview, and you will get a good movie.  When the audience  is not expecting much and you surprise them, it will leave an impact.  Anyway, American Beauty is great.  It is such a tease to not release it  until October!	5.0	The Formula For A Good Movie	2000-06-22	4	2	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3DDRVEBLLCAAW	Brett Foster	"First, I love American Beauty.  In recent years, The Matrix and Crouching Tiger are the only other films I've seen more than once while still in first-run theaters, and American Beauty has much more substance than either of those.  This movie is not an ""ugly look at life"" as some have said.  It is an extremely hopeful look at life.  Lester is a very real character that can be easily identified with, and everybody who feels that in some way their life has become a pathetic routine of dull existence can find assurance in the message that there's always time to make something of your life.  The opening narration very clearly states this as Kevin Spacey says:""Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and they're right.  I have lost something.  I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn't always feel this... sedated.  But you know what?  It's never too late to get it back.""This movie is an inspiring message wrapped up in fun humor, great music, and beautiful cinematography.  The director states that it is a movie about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment.  I'm shocked at the number of people who just don't get it.  The people I know personally who don't like American Beauty aren't actually friends of mine, and they generally have that cranky, going-nowhere attitude about life.  (...) Does Lester&#8217;s mundane life hit a little too close to home?The closest thing to a legitimate criticism is that the movie glorifies a would-be pedophile.  People who say this need to pay more attention.  Lester is a middle-aged guy who isn't getting any at home, and Angela is constantly giving him eyes.  He even hears her shouting the obscene things she wants to do to him.  She claims to have had more sex as a teen than Lester has in his whole life.  Then Lester finds out his wife is ""getting nailed by the King of Real Estate.""  It&#8217;s understandable that his affection shifts from his wife to Angela.  Once Lester finds out the truth about Angela, we see a nice guy who wouldn't think of touching her.  Lester is a normal man who shows a moment of human weakness when a young girl is coming on strong.  If you think that makes him a pedophile, I'd hate to see your opinion of Kuberick's Lolita, where an even older man is very actively pursuing an even younger girl.  Just look at the facts.  Mena Suvari was 20 when the movie was made.  She plays a high-school girl who is old enough to drive, meaning her character is between the ages of 16 and 18.  16 is above the age of consent in 39 of 50 US states.  This film does not glorify a pedophile.(...) Yes, it is somewhat unpleasant seeing Lester get his brains blown out, but if they wanted gore, they would&#8217;ve shown the exit wound and made the blood darker, instead of making a bright puddle to match the red theme of the film.  Yes, the movie shows young girls&#8217; breasts, but I don&#8217;t see anybody accusing Traffic of being child pornography, and that has graphic depiction of a teenage girl whoring herself for drugs.  The beauty lies in the transformation of Lester.  I feel sorry for anybody who doesn&#8217;t fill with joy at the beginning of chapter 21.  I&#8217;m not a big fan of The Who, I don&#8217;t run marathons, and I don&#8217;t aspire to flip burgers, but when the film cuts to Lester running down the middle of the street to &#8220;The Seeker,&#8221; it makes me glad to be alive.Anyway, the DVD itself is a real disappointment.  Look at the name of the DVD.  ""The Awards Edition.""  It should've been called the (...) Edition.  This DVD was specifically made so that fans would end up purchasing the DVD twice when the REAL version is released.OK, maybe it's not that bad...  It DOES have both DTS and Dolby 5.1 audio, and it is one of the few DVD's that doesn't make you sit through a minute of obnoxious ""don't copy this"" warnings.  It DOES have two trailers, audio commentary, a featurette which just says, ""This movie is great!"", and a ""storyboard presentation.""So let me tell you what the problems are.  Just try to watch the hour-long storyboard special feature.  Particularly annoying is that it is one single 61-minute chapter.  It's really just a 49-image slideshow being discussed by the director and cinematographer.  The first 22 minutes of the presentation are spent discussing chapter 1-4 of the DVD.  The rest of the presentation skips around discussing chapter 5-18 of the DVD, and it ends abruptly without touching on the last 10 chapters.The most important flaw is heard when listening to the director commentary.(...)If you listen to the commentary, it's obvious that a ""deleted scenes"" section has already been compiled and prepared for the DVD, but they chose not to include it with ""The Awards Edition.""  Nobody in their right mind would say, ""I think people would rather see this horrible and incomplete storyboard discussion instead of the deleted scenes.""  It is clear that Dreamworks just wants to force the true fans to buy the DVD twice to get the version with the deleted scenes.  Expect to see &#8220;American Beauty: Special Edition&#8221; in a year or two."	2.0	Wonderful movie, Horrible DVD	2001-11-25	5	3	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AE23DYT0RDFUV	Brian Ridgway	Well, that may not be entirely accurate. I shouldn't say that this movie was a HUGE disappointment, simply because I went in with no expectations. And am I qualified to fully review?--since I was so bored with this film  that I walked out of the screening room after an hour? Maybe not. But I  will say this: AM has been called a sharp black comedy, commenting on  current American values. I didn't find the film particularly funny or  insightful (sorry folks--'King of Comedy' and 'Little Murders' w/Elliot  Gould still have more to say about American 'values' than this picture); I  didn't find the story particularly compelling (it reads more like a quiet,  suburban soap opera); and the performances didn't quite jell (the actors  all performed as if in different films, seperate from each other). To their  credit, Spacey (far better in t.v.'s WISEGUY) turned in a rather staid  performance, but this role was low on energy and believability. And I'm a  huge fan of Benning, but I will say that she gives it her all in a film  that is neither creatively photographed nor emotionally gripping, and  certainly doesn't do her any favors career-wise. All in all, it's a pretty  toothless effort from a group that should have been able to produce  something more.And finally, I can say this: even an episode of FOX's  comedy series 'TITUS' is sharper and more scathing than this weak effort.  Personally, I find it a bit insulting that a British director seems to  think this script qualified as any sort of legitimate contemporary  commentary, especially for someone working inside the 'Hollywood system.'  But I suppose that being a director for the major studios certainly  qualifies him as a keen observer of Midwestern values and the human  condition. Is it any wonder the Bristish no longer have a legitimate film  community? We should have seen this one coming a long ways away, and turned  it back before it reached the shores.	1.0	American Beauty--Biggest Boxoffice Disappointment of 1999	2000-05-25	34	13	21
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A14LIZKKA7WYT9	brigsbmc@cs.com	AMERICAN BEAUTY was awarded the Oscar for Best picture last year, and with due cause.  It is an incredible movie about the disintegration of a marriage,  and some have gone so far to say that it is a study of the disintegration of the American family.  The directorial debut of Sam Mendes(Broadway's Cabaret Director) is one that will be remembered for years to come.  Alan Ball wrote the original screenplay,  winning an Oscar for his efforts,  as well as an Oscar for Mendes.  The story focuses on Lester and Carolyn Burnham.  While their daughter seems to hate both of them,  it seems as though they begin to hate each other,  although Lester attempts reconciliation to no avail.  Lester(Kevin Spacey) becomes infatuated with his daughter Jane's(Thora Birch)friend,  Angela(Mena Suvari).  Meanwhile,  Carolyn(Annette Bening) begins having an affair with a fellow real estate agent Buddy Kane(Peter Gallagher).  Jane falls in love with the next door neighbor Ricky(Wes Bentley) who is under strict watch by his ex-colonel father Frank(Chris Cooper).  This movie takes ordinary people and creates a chain reaction,  changing their lives forever.  Mendes has directed this film with incredible skill and panache,  and Ball's script is brilliant.  The real story here is the ensemble,  which won Best Ensemble award at the Screen Actors Guild Awards .  Kevin Spacey is simply incredible as Lester,  winning his second Oscar and first in the lead actor category(He recently won for The Usual Suspects as supporting actor).  Annette Bening gives the performance of a life-time as Carolyn, bringing new meaning to the word lead actress. Thora Birch is great as Jane,  the perfect image of a confused teen.  Mena Suvari is able to give a good deal of depth to a stereotypically unlikeable character.  Bravo! Chris Cooper is an excellent character actor,  making Frank Fitts an unforgettable character.  One of the most surprisingly brilliant and hardest characters was played with perfection by Wes Bentley.  Peter Gallagher is suave as Buddy,  and Allison Janney gives one of the strangest yet most powerful roles as Ricky's mother.  All together, this film won five Oscars, and is a must-see for everyone!	5.0	Stunning!	2001-05-17	3	0	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	Nominated for eight Academy Awards, and winner of five including Best Picture, American Beauty is one of the best films of all time. Exploring the depths of the American Dream - a good job, a nice house, the perfect marriage, etc. - the film is dripping with symbolism and satire. A cinematic study of societal dysfunction, American Beauty will affect a broad range of emotions within its viewing audience, and it'll make you laugh as well. This is a great movie, and although some people will shy away from it, everyone should see American Beauty at least once so they can form their own opinion...Kevin Spacey plays the role of Lester Burnham, a middle-aged suburban resident who seemingly lives the American Dream. He and his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) have a nice house, a beautiful daughter Jane (Thora Birch), and successful careers. But things aren't always as they seem. In reality, the Burnham's are the definition of dysfunctional. They fight over everything, screaming at the dinner table about ridiculous things such as vegetables. Carolyn is engaged in an affair with rival real estate broker Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), and Lester is suffering from a creeping depression/mid-life crisis.Meanwhile, Jane is developing an infatuation with the strange boy who recently moved in next door, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) - a drug dealer/homespun director with a homophobic Marine Corps father, Frank. When the source of Frank's homophobia bubbles to the surface, we learn that - just like the Burnham's - most of the neighborhood is living a different life from that which shows on the outside...Kevin Spacey follows up his amazing performances in The Usual Suspects and L.A. Confidential with his Academy Award for Best Actor in this film. Some of the funniest scenes in American Beauty involve the depressed Lester Burnham and his mid-life crisis meltdown. The way in which Spacey walks out of his job is utterly hilarious, and his weed-smoking, weight-lifting regimen in an effort to get pumped up and impress his daughter's friend is classic. But Spacey's performance is not alone. His brilliant role is complimented by Annette Bening's Oscar-caliber transformation into Lester's bitchy, cut-throat real-estate broker wife, Carolyn Burnham. Together, the two can stage an onscreen fight like no other fake married couple in cinema history, and it's a true pleasure to watch.American Beauty is further strengthened by Chris Cooper's role as the Burnham's homophobic neighbor (October Sky, The Patriot, Seabiscuit) and Mena Suvari's role as the big-talking school girl Angela Hayes, object of Lester's desires (Kiss The Girls, American Pie). American Beauty is a film bursting with stage talent, one that benefits from solid direction, a well-designed screenplay, and superb dialogue. Odds are, you'll either love it or hate it. But irrespective of your final take, American Beauty will invoke passion one way or the other. That's why this film ranks as a definite must-see...The DVD Report	5.0	One of the top films of the 1990s...	2005-04-19	6	4	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AOJ0ORN9VTPGE	BrKaT818	An appealing film on many different levels - visually, viscerally, and emotionally.  For his first film, director Sam Mendes did an awesome job.  Each frame was meticulously framed and shot with perfection.  My initial reaction was one of being stuck by the pure visual sensation of the movie.The storyline was also one that many can relate to.  Here is a beautiful couple, Lester and Caroline Burnham, with good jobs and a beautiful daughter, Jane, who live in a beautiful home in beautiful neighborhood.  Despite having what appears to be the ideal life each one is thoroughly unhappy and is searching for something they think they lack.  Lester and Caroline are dissatisfied with their jobs and each other.  Jane hates her body and her parents.  Each searches for what they believe is a more meaningful relationship - Caroline with successful married real estate agent, Lester with Jane's sultry girlfriend, and Jane with the strange boy who lives next door.  This certainly doesn't fully represent everyone's life but does reflect some small element in each of us.Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening and Thora Birch give solid performances but it's Mena Suvari at her sensual and sultry best.	5.0	A Movie Gem	2005-01-03	4	3	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3QY0E16Y3ZJIC	Bronson O Janes	I am one of those who has been lucky enough to get my hands on a copy of the DVD screener of American Beauty.  This format really allows the movie to flourish.  I watched the Pan and Scan VHS version and the difference is unvelievable.  The picture quality of the transfer is unbelievable.  Crisp,  clear, sharp images, and the colors are spectacular (especially the  ever-present and crucial Red's).  Even though this movie did not have many  surround sound effects, the ambient noise that was produced made for a very  nice field of sound in my viewing room.  The movie was presented in  widescreen, exactly the same as in the theaters.  This was a great film  transfer. There were very few (if any) artifacts in the film, and there was  minimal cases of &quot;shimmering&quot; in the movie.  All in all this DVD  gets a 5/5.  (The only things i didn't like, but i expected since it is a  screener, is that the entire movie is on a single chapter that is 2 hours  long.  And periodically during the movie a notice comes up about illegal  sale, copywrite, public presentation, sales.. yadda yadda yadda).  I have  been borrowing this DVD from an old friend of mine for two weeks now, and I  have watched it at least 12 times.  Each time i watch it, I fear for the  day when i must return it to him.	5.0	American Beauty DVD review	2000-06-06	2	1	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3FVECK2Z6CVJD	Bryan Joslin	The main reason I wanted to add my comments was that I saw no other mention of Allison Janney.  If you are a fan of hers, watch for her understated and stunning, albeit small, performance as the timid mother of Ricky (Barbara Fitts).  This performance truly demonstrates the range and untapped talent of the great actress.  (Yes, I'm a big fan.)Having said that, this film does start out making you feel your watching an overslick production of Hollywood banality.  Oh contraire (sp?).  My favorite films delve deep into character study and development (e.g. Dolores Claiborne, Shawshank Redemption, Dangerous Liaisons, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Sophie's Choice, Fried Green Tomatoes).  This film gives it to you in spades.If you enjoy stories that make you think you've got everyone figured out, then prove you wrong...this is a must see.	5.0	Hollywood Slick Meets Character Study - A Perfect Blend	2004-04-23	5	3	2

The director of the movie planned it that way. First off the movie was about seeing that life is so fast and hectic and you shouldn't let it pass you. Also dont let people walk over you. Kevin Spacey showed that in the movie. Last but not least you have to work for your moment. It just doesnt happen. By moment i mean your 15 mins of fame. It shows that if you want something bad enough you will get it. I think thats what Spacey showed in the movie. By working out and standing up for him self. He proved that even in the end if you die you can still come out of life feeling good and not down. Dont sit back and let your moment fly by.

Surette	Here is a movie that doesn't merely entertain the audience, showing them what they want to see and happily following idealistic stereotypes about family life and relationships. The writer and director instead probe much  deeper into the ties that keep friends and families together, questioning  our motivations, aspirations, and convictions, and ultimately revealing  answers that many of us may find unsettlingly accurate.This movie asks  questions about the legitimacy of many of our social obligations, the  dangers of paranoia and close-mindedness, the worth of self-happiness, and  the value of appreciating all that is beautiful in a life often all too  short.More importantly, each theme is carefully considered from  multiple perspectives, with each side sympathetically and respectfully  depicted with both humor and solemnity.Beautifully acted and filmed,  American Beauty is a superbly thoughtful, powerful, relevant, as well as  entertaining movie.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3HTX1NOTTWERP	Busy Body	I first watched American Beauty a few nights ago after putting it off for years. I instantly wanted to see this film after it scooped all those Oscars back in 2000, but I never got around to doing so. To cut a long story short, I watched it the other night, after forgetting about it. My expectations, admittedly, were rather low. How wrong I was.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is your average, middle-aged family man. He works a $60,000 per annum job and lives as home with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) who is a straight-laced, worry wart who sells real estate and is obsessed with looking her best and being successful. They both have a daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) who is your typical rebellious teenage girl, unsatisfied with her figure, despises her parents and longs for someone who will love her. Living next door we have the 18-year-old Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) who lives with his father Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts and his rather catatonic wife. What we have appears to be two typical American families, living through the trials and tribulations of family life, and living the American dream.However, things are certainly not as they seem, and director Sam Mendes cleverly unravels this as the film progresses. Lester instantly falls for his daughter's best friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a game. His marriage is currently in a rut, his wife hates him and they haven't made love in a long, long time. Her beauty transforms him, and some of the greatest moments of this movie are where he detaches from reality and slips into a fantasy world where it is just him and her together - the most famous being the nude rose petals scene. He is soon working out and building himself up to impress her. Jane is 'friends' with this vixen character Angela, but at times the latter's beauty depresses Jane, who is already insecure about her appearance. Angela can't understand why Ricky isn't interested in her, just because every other guy is. Ricky, however, is more interested in Jane. She hides it at first, but deep down, she's touched that someone is interested in her. What blossoms is a sweet and beautiful relationship, despite the insane parents they both have. Some of the film's best moments are the intimate connections of loneliness that these two angst-ridden teenagers share.Ricky's father is one of the most striking and memorable characters from the film, and all for the wrong reasons. He's a homophobic and straight-laced man who lives his life by rules. When he bursts into Ricky's room and beats him for entering his secret room, not only are we shocked by what is happening, but by Ricky's lack of resistance. Suddenly we realise why he spends so much time filming floating paper bags, dead birds and Jane - he believe in the hope of escapism from his horrific father (&quot;Yes Sir. Thank you Sir.&quot;). We also realise why Ricky's mother is slightly catatonic - she has obviously been beaten into submission by the evil man. This is the point in the film, in my opinion, in which the film's dark and violent side breaks through. American life is not as shiny and happy as it seems.Carolyn starts an affair with her real estate competition, and it's truly funny to see her try and act all sophisticated around Lester. She is so materialistic, it's unreal. It's more important to her than living, and it's a sad state of affairs when we witness this. The finale to the film is superb. By the end she's a self-help sad case and a gun-toting loony who realises everything she's lost. Lester takes more control of his life, dropping his $60,000 a year job to take up a job in a fast-food restaurant (I love his line, &quot;I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility!&quot;). He lets go of his whole life and responsibilities. He decides to look after himself and perfecting his goal on bedding Angela. By the end of the film he almost succeeds, until she confesses it's her first time. All the blabbing about the action she's been getting is all rubbish. Lester realises too late how immature he has been, and he can't go back and change it. The conclusion of Lester's final state comes from someone who cannot face up to who he is, because he lives by society's expectations. He can't face up to being something he is so against, and this serves as a stark reminder to us all.The whole film is superbly filmed and brilliantly acted. Kevin Spacey is superb, as is Annette Bening. Thora Birch is simply gorgeous as Jane, and her angst-ridden teenage role of rebellion is incredibly believable. Wes Bentley shines amazingly, and Mena Suvari is very convincing as that feisty vixen. This really is one of the best-assembled casts I have ever seen from a movie. Sam Mendes pulled off an amazing feat in directing this movie, and for once, the Academy got it right in making this Best Picture Of The Year. There are moments in this film that I can relate to more than any other film, and some moments make me want to cry because of the intense emotion on display.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10I watched this film with my mum the other day - she didn't like it much because of the swearing, but that's to be expected, but to dismiss it as a poor film as she did stunned me. This was by far one of the best movies I have ever seen, and a few obscenities isn't going to change that! The soundtrack to this film is equally stunning - the quiet music in these intimate moments is fantastic and completely draws you into the film with the characters. All in all, this is a must see movie for anyone who is a fan of social satires. A masterpiece of the biggest standards.	5.0	Even Red Roses Cannot Disguise The Truth...	2004-04-07	19	14	5

Definitely a classic.I am generally NOT a fan of mainstream films, and might have passed this one up due to its unbelievable acceptance by the masses (baaaaaah).  I prefer off-beat, independent films because I usually find the typical mainstream movies a tad ho-hum.  But I found the humor in this very unique and refreshing...this is the type of movie John Waters should have evolved into making.All cast members do a great job, and Annette Bening is particularly hilarious as an &quot;empowered&quot; real estate agent and wife.The movie has some serious moments here and there, and you may see yourself in it from time to time, but I was overwhelmed more by its humor and frankness.	5.0	Thoroughly enjoyable dark comedy	2001-01-04	4	1	3

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A227E26SPZO7A1	Caesar J. Cabalfin	When this movie was first released in theatres back in September of 1999, I shyed away from purchasing a ticket at the box office.  I had seen the reviews and was unimpressed.  Ironically, it starred Kevin Spacey who is among my favorite actors working today.  The subject matter (at first glance) seemed contrived in it's satirical look at modern day suburbia.  It seemed prime for a Sunday 8pm time slot on the Lifetime channel and not the big screen.  After seeing &quot;Magnolia&quot; (which I hated) in December later that year, I was in no hurry to see &quot;American Beauty&quot;.  The two films seemed all too similar in tone and dramatic content.  I was glad that I finally gave in earlier this year and rented this fine work by first time film director Sam Mendes.  Unlike &quot;Magnolia&quot;, this film has a discernible purpose: to give the audience a voyeuristic view into the life of Lester Burnham (Spacey) and the supporting players and draw similarities to how we view our own lives. The rest of the cast is suberb (especially Wes Bentley who steals every scene).  &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a poignant and powerful film which I highly recommend.	5.0	Opposite of Magnolia	2000-10-18	3	2	1

This is that rare movie that slips threw the cracks of all the buddy comedies and inspirational sports dramas to deliver something so original and new, and at the same time as familar as the ground we walk on.This movie has no flaws. And I can assure you that is a fact, not niavety. I've never seen a film this honest and brutal and touching. I don't believe I have ever cried so hard at the end of a movie, not because a character had died, but because the last year of his stupid life was the most wonderful thing I had ever witnessed.This is a movie that will change you. This may sound overly dramatized, but I am a different person for having seen this.I miss the people in this picture.  I truely miss them. Not in a clainering-for-a-sequel kind of way, but god-what-will-there-lives-be-like/how-will-I-live-without-them kind of way.Ok, enough vauge admeration, on to the actual review.This is one of those movies that is hard as all hell to pen down.I suppose you could say it's about a middle-aged man who despertley wants to sleep with a teenage girl, a working mom sick of herself but rufuses to believe its anyone's fault but every one else,the aforementioned people's daughter who believes she is ugly and worthless until she meets and falls for her voyuristic-drug dealing neighbor and makes her realize how beautiful she truely is.But really, it is so much simpler than that.This film is about the beauty that is found in everything: a plastic bag caught in the wind, a dead bird, the face of the girl you love and even a gaping head wound.Again,I was not being over zealeus when I said this film WILL change you. So long as you can look closer and see the beauty of it, you wll with out a doubt be a different person when the credits roll.Thank you Sam Mendes. Thank you Alan Ball.

This  extraordinarily directed film shows everything around Lester in the last  stage of his life were all the problems come together until he explodes(  not literally) and becomes irresponsible,quits his job, drugs himself with  his neighbor etc. This film also has really weird and great characters like  the young neighbor who besides dealing drugs, filmed everything around him,  his wife played by Annette Bening who is a perfect woman has everything in  order and is kind of neurotic, two of his neighbors were gay and his other  neighbor hated gays causing troubles at the end of the movie.But what I  truly love about this movie is that at the end after showing us the many  beauties in this world Lester shows his family and his surroundings were  really far from being American Beauty. So rent it ,buy it whatever but  don't or at least try not to miss this great film which by the way got many  many awards which it deserved.	5.0	THE BEST FILM OF THIS DECADE!	2000-06-11	1	1	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AI8VJA7Y6TMYO	"""carlshowalter"""	Contrary to to what everyone seems to think, the original screenplay of &quot;American Beauty&quot; *was* changed.(note that the following will ruin the ending)In the original script, Lester succeeds in having sex with Angela on the couch, and she confesses her virginity after. In comparison with Lester's character throughout the rest of the film, this is inconsistent, and was changed solely to give him a false epiphany, and evoke sympathy from the audience when his brains were blown out. If he had sex with her and then found out about her virginity, it would have made more sense, would have been more powerful and poignant in a less sentimental, gimmicky way, and, like so few movies in cinema history, might have been a real tragic masterpiece.I am awfully suspicious of that Steven Spielberg story. It reeks of the kind of rumor people make up to make a movie seem incredibly great, hiding the truth. If you read the PUBLISHED screenplay, Alan Ball's preface recalls another instance where the original script was changed.Don't be so gullible.What happened to the &quot;American Beauty&quot; script happens to virtually every movie you will ever see in a conglomerate theatre. Unfortunately, it is only the lesser-known independent films, of which everyone seems to have a preconcieved bias against, that maintain integrity.

This is the culture we are exporting. This is why they hate us. Okay, I can see that some people like the idea of the poor, put upon patriarch finally standing up to his unappreciative family. Lots of deep, dark, disturbing images - we in America seem to like that sort of thing for some reason. What is it that makes it OK to celebrate old men seducing little girls? Okay, so he doesn't follow through - when she tells him she is actually a virgin. Would it have been okay if she had not been? Does that make it okay that he gets killed? That the only decent relationships the man seems to have is with children?

Sexy naked teenaged girls and images of Annette Bening with her legs in the air may make a lot of money, but there's plenty of that on the Internet.The violence, the homophobia juxtaposed with homosexual imagery that only contributes to the phoniness of what passes for ""family values"" - perhaps it is the hypocrisy above all that so many could relate to.I'm glad I saw this movie just so I can say I saw it, given that it seems to be such a cultural icon.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A17N23WXA7EAF	"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter"""	&quot;American Beauty&quot; is one of the few great films to come out of Hollywood in recent times. It is a film of irony and contrast with a deeply revealing title. The film contrasts two different kinds of beauty: the material objects (money, home, sex partners) that we think are beautiful and the potential we have as human beings to enrich each other's lives. It is often our misconception of beauty that hinders our attainment of the real thing.Although the film takes place in suburban America and shows us the gnawing misery, and dissapointment that many of its denizens feel, it is not an assault on anyone's values or way of life. Instead, it is a study of the confusion and misdirection that most people feel and which drives them to inadvertantly hurt one another.Lester Burnham is angry at his wife because she appears to be an obsessive materialist to him. His wife despises him because he does not do the things that she believes are necessary to ensure the family's survival. Lester's daughter hates him because he lusts for her best friend. This is a bit of a gray area because on the one hand her resentment is based on sincere revulsion, and on the other hand it is based on a sense of loss of her fauther's attention in a psycho-sexual manner. Lester's neighbor appears to be a typical bigot, and homophobe, while the neighbor's eccentric son is the only person who seems to actually see what is going on in other peoples' lives. The son furtively films the Burnhams and in the process he gains insite into their disenchantment. He also falls in love with and has an affair with Lester's daughter.The film questions why we choose to lead the kind of lives we do and what our fixations--many of which are rooted in materialism--really amount to. Lester lusts for his daughter's friend, but in the end he redeems himself by caring for her in a compassionate manner rather than taking advantage of her. The biggoted neighbor on the other hand is unable to transcend his homophobic fixations which--no surprise here--are rooted in his own repressed homosexuality. One of the most tragic and sympathetic characters in the film is Lester's wife. In the process of struggling to look after her family in the best way she knows how (selling houses and keeping her own home spotless)she is left with a sense of yearning but no idea of what she is missing or how to obtain it.At the end of the film, moments before his death, Lester looks at a picture of his emotionally estranged wife and daughter and shakes his head in happy disbelief. Despite the problems, fights, and misunderstandings he realizes that they are the source of his happiness and and that they have many possibilites together. The evolution of Lester's sense of beauty--from lusting for a teenage girl to feeling genuine love for his family--is similar to Socrates'sense of beauty in &quot;The Symposium&quot;. The film does not give us a neat and tidy ending. Lester dies before he can act on his realization and it is unclear whether his wife and daughter will achieve the same understanding he did.&quot;American Beauty&quot; shows us that most of our unhappiness is illusary. We are afraid of things which may or may not exist and we are struggling to obtain things of marginal importance. In the process of disecting these things, the film also reveals our tremendous possibility for happiness. This possibility is surrounded by obstacles and is often invisible. It often comes on the tail end of many mistakes and only if we are open-minded or perceptive enough to grasp it. But it is very real and it is out there for all of us. This is the actual American beauty.	5.0	Family Values	2000-07-09	0	0	0

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A29IYGR7SNPRIV	"Charlotte Vale-Allen ""writerinresidence"""	With an opening voiceover stolen directly from Sunset Boulevard, this film is pretty typical of undeserving movies that win The Big Prize. Spacey and Bening are a fairly loathsome couple, only sympathetic intermittently. The truly compelling aspect of the film resides in the family next door: father Chris Cooper, mother Allison Janney, and son Wes Bentley. What goes on in this household is the true stuff of moviemaking. Janney who has achieved much-deserved fame as a result of her role on The West Wing has been around quite a while, turning in flawless performances each time out of the gate. But what she does in American Beauty, with only a few lines of dialogue, is simply awe-inspiring. I came away from this film positively stricken by her performance which is a masterpiece of understated acting. The same is true of Chris Cooper (who is, at last, getting much-deserved recognition for his fine talent) in the role of a man trying to contain massive fears about his true identity. And Wes Bentley is terrific, dark and defiant, as the son of this household.If you take a step back and look closely at the Spacey character, what you see is perilously close to pedophelia--a man lusting after an underage girl. That it's covered in rose petals doesn't make it any more palatable. Yes there are some good scenes but it doesn't alter the core thesis that a middle-aged man, fed up with his awful family, makes drastic changes to his life because he is hopelessly drawn to a teenage girl.Watch this one for the Janney, Cooper, Bentley performances. They're worth the time. The rest of this prize-winner is derivative--an apple with a worm at its core.	3.0	Overrated	2003-02-23	29	9	20

Now that I got  that off my chest...I've seen 4 of the 5 movies that were nominated for  Best Movie of 1999. Out of the 4, American Beauty was by far at the bottom  of my list. I strongly feel that The Green Mile or The Insider should have  won, followed by The Sixth Sense. I've watched American Beauty twice, and  if it weren't for Kevin Spacey, then I probably wouldn't have ever seen it.  Kevin Spacey is by far one of the best actors out there. His brilliant  performance as Lester makes this average movie worth watching at least  once. He definetly steals the show! Other then that, in my opinion, this is  an average movie. There was nothing exciting or climactic in the movie. The  best part of the movie had to be the last 15 minutes of the movie.  Everything throughout the movie all came to one.	2.0	Not Oscar worthy!

Having got that out of the way, I have to say that seeing this film again at 42 (the protagonist's age) left me a little less engaged than I had hoped.  By the second go-around I had accumulated enough existential (and real) pain under my belt to make Spacey's character's travails seem like a walk in the park, but that gave me little satisfaction.  I found myself disappointed that it did not seem a more mature, nuanced film given my new lens.  It's still very good; beautifully shot and cleverly contrived. But make no mistake, it belongs more squarely with the trivial middle-age breakout/revenge fantasy flicks of the world, rather than the fewer in number that seek to truly transcend the deathly mire that seems to be the lot of they typical American middle-aged male. So if you want a kick-ass movie, this one comes up roses.  If you want to know the answer to life, the universe and everything, this one might not be the one. But still worth watching!	4.0	Rose to the occasion	2009-11-20	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AKVU4HUG6AN1U	"""chick_flick"""	"""American Beauty"" is the beautiful, original American film, directed by--surprise--British director, Sam Mendes.PLOT SUMMARY: Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, an average, everyday, hard working father/husband, who works for a magazine...boring job. His wife, Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is an overahciever, work-aholic, real estate seller. And his teenage daughter, Jane Burnham (Thora Birch), is rebellious and conceited--or so we think. Lester is going through a mid-life crisis, and his life is going down the drain. First, he finds out that Carolyn is having an affair with her arch rival, the successful real estate seller, Buddy Kane (Pete Gallagher). Lester always used to do whatever Carolyn wanted, to avoid arguing or getting a divorce, but now he's starting to stick up for himself. He just met Jane's new high school friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), and he's fallen in love with her beauty. Jane is being stalked by the teenage boy next door who's family just moved to town, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Lester wants to get to know his daughter better, but she refuses to spend more time with him, after she finds out that he likes her best friend. Lester also quits his terrible job when they hire a new vice president, begins to exercise in hopes that he will be able to impress Angela, and even starts smoking pot with Ricky, who he's befriended, though he doesn't realize Ricky likes his daughter. Ricky's abusive, gay-hating father, Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper), also has a dark secret...which you will learn when you watch the film.OVERALL THOUGHTS: ""American Beauty"" is a thought-provoking film. It's poignant and entertaining. Sam Mendes does an incredible directing job. The cinematography is stunning, and the music is haunting. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely superb--especially the performance given by Kevin Spacey. The storyline and script are amazing. There's a good twist to the ending, which makes it original and stands out from all the rest that are similar to it.The DVD extras are a nice finishing touch to the DVD. This DVD includes a making of the film featurette, exclusive storyboards, commentary, production notes, and theatrical trailers.I highly recommend ""American Beauty"".Score:100/100A+"	5.0	Breathtaking film about an average American family.	2003-01-17	7	2	5

I was the unfortunate one to not see it in theatres, when everyone did. But, the Trailer for American Beauty got me thinking a lot about how they put these strange scenes together. After watching it on video I was in Awe! (I wanted to see it on DVD first but I couldn't wait) All of the visually stunning scenes, cinematography and dialogue made me love this film. There is something very Beautiful about the way this movie flew from one scene to the next. The fantacies of Lester towards Angela was incredible and rather funny (especially the gym scene). And the final scene in the end made me see why this was the winner for Best Picture. This is truly one of the great films that people should see to get the real raw emotions that the actors/actresses portrayed in American Beauty.	4.0	Stunning Beauty	2002-03-27	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3NEZL3LPUJAXK	Chris Ivey	"The phrase ""beauty is only skin deep"" has never been more truthful in this drama about the layers beneath a small suburban family. Kevin Spacey dawns the role of middle aged, emotionally stunted father (Lestor Burnham), who is revitalized by his attraction to this rebellious daughter's best friend.. This film breaks the formula of the ""perfect"" family by showing that looks are definitely deceiving. From the initial image of a quiet street at the films beginning, to the eerie narrative of Lestor from beyond the grave, this film shows that nothing is what it seems. Rather, the viewer lulled into a false sense of rural bliss, then dropped on the ground of reality. The lives of the characters are not ""peachy"" and ""picture perfect."" Lestor Burnham's wife (Annette Bening) ignores the socially constructed idea of intrinsic domestic ability as she leaves her own home to indulge a sultry affair, as his daughter Jane (Thora Birtch) realizes that beauty is truly relative. This film takes the saying ""you can't judge a book"" by its cover and gives it a new spin."	5.0	Womens Studies 285C Final, Professor O'Sickey	2004-05-11	3	2	1

""cscotts"""	Hands down one of the most profound and strikingly original movies to be released in the last decade, AMERICAN BEAUTY gives the audiences a glimpse into the everyday life of your 'average' American family--suffice it to say, you're a LONG way from the Brady Bunch here.  Kevin Spacey justifies his Oscar win as the films male parental unit, Lester Burnham, basically a going nowhere fortysomething who's lost all interest in life, including the part that his marriage occupies.  Annette Bening gives her finest performance to date(and highly underrated) as his seemingly perky real estate agent wife Carolyn.  Bening gravitates between happy and pathetic, usually in the same scene, and does so with the slightest of ease.  Thora Birch, a long way from her days as a child actress, gives a sterling performance as Jane, Lester and Carolyn's daughter who is completely frustrated with the &quot;lameness&quot; with which her parents lead their life.  She's also appalled at the way with which her horny father gawks at her best friend Angela.  She's played by Mena Suvari, in possibly the film's most revelatory performance, as Suvari goes far deeper than most would into what makes this usually token jailbait character tick, and comes out with a completely fleshed out portrait of a very insecure young girl.  Also playing the gawking game,with better results, is Wes Bentley, who plays Rickey, the Burnham's cleverly sly drug dealer neighbor, and the pursuer of their daughter's affections.Rounding the acting ensemble is Chris Cooper, who plays Rickey's dad(and who has some very deep-rooted secrets) and Allison Janney, that rare actress who never fails to bring anything less than an indelible impression to even the smallest of roles, as Rickey's mother.  The story is utterly thought-provoking--this is that rare movie that lives so much better beyond the hype that surrounded it.  It was completely warranted.	5.0	Profound Filmmaking	2001-08-16	5	1	4

After a while the basic message of the film began to take shape for me and made a colossal difference.  So (without giving anything away), I believe this movie is about bravery.  Not the kind of &quot;I'll take the hill&quot; bravery we're used to, but everyday bravery, the kind that is too often found in short supply.  It's a story about a man who is almost a composite of what allot of men subconsciously strive for (not how he turns out, but the basic attributes of his life).  His world slowly and unnoticably degenerated into a life of misery.And he did something about it.He bravely decided to change.He doesn't follow the textbook, and so a good deal of drama ensues, but he does his best.  I found it admirable, brave, and, well, no pun intended, but I found it really beautiful.You're entitled to disagree with my interpretation, but when I shared it with a very intelligent friend of mine who didn't like the film, he instantly changed his opinion on it.I hope you enjoy half as much as I did.	5.0	I almost walked out of one of my favorite movies of all time	2004-04-21	5	4	1

His work on this film was nothing short of mastery, showing the beauty in everything we find so mundane, but the truest beauty of this film was in Alan Ball's script, a profound work that finds comfort in being occasionally aimless without ever missing the point: that you should never be afraid to be yourself.

Every year I write a &quot;Top 10 Films of the Year&quot; article.  In 1999, I had to do fifteen and I still had to make cuts that I didn't want to.  But &quot;American Beauty&quot; was put at the top of my list without a second thought.This is a movie about modern American life, about desire, about unhappiness, about love, lust, sin, and redemption.  This film gives me chills every single time I see it, no lie.  It is funny, sad, uplifting, and all too true.  The tagline &quot;Look Closer&quot; sums it up perfectly.  You never know what's going on behind your neighbors picket fences.The performances in this film are top notch.  Kevin Spacey IS Lester Burnham.  He makes me believe in his characters motivations and actions.  Annette  Benning is absolutely brilliant.  Chris Cooper is utterly amazing and Wes Bentley is (to use an overdone term) a revelation.  And I do not believe that Mena Suvari got nearly enough attention for her performance.The script is dead on perfect.  Brilliant themes, perfect pacing, funny, and enthralling.  I cannot wait to see what Alan Ball turns out next.  The cinematography is beautiful.  Every shot is a work of art.  The lighting, the colors, its perfect!Sam Mendes masterfully helms this picture.  He uses great restraint and controls what could so easily get out of hand like a true master.See this movie.  See this movie NOW!

I don't think so.  To me it's mostly style over substance, and derivative and imitative as well.  Examples:  A middle-aged suburban guy discovers his life is empty and his job is demeaning.  Wow, there's a new one.  Second, the teenage daughter hates her parents and feels unwanted.  Gee, how original.  Third, the wife is frigid and controlling - there's some imiginative thinking for you!  And the kid next door is a loner and considered weird, but turns out to be sensitive and wise.  Again, what originality.Most every scene is predictable and hackneyed.  Example:  The retired Marine next door is greeted by his gay neighbors with a welcome basket (fruit, of course).  The SECOND he opened the door for these two gay neighbors I knew the tough-guy, homophobic Marine would turn out to be secretly gay himself!  Trite and obvious.And what about the similarities with Fast Times at Ridgmont High??  Yes, you heard me correctly.  Examples:  The most beautiful girl in Fast Times (Phoebe Cates) claims to be sexually active, yet is not!  A.B., same story with the luscious blond cheerleader.  In American B., we have an honest, ordinary guy searching for meaning and his place in life (Kevin Spacey).  In  F. T., same role played by Judge Reinhold.  Isn't Kevin Spacey just playing the grown-up Judge Reinhold?  In American B., there's the dark-haired loner dude, who finds true love in the end.  In F.T., same story with the wise-cracking Italian kid!The only character in American Beauty who pulled me in and made me care, the only character who was unique and intriguing, was the Marine's wife.  What a lonely, defeated woman.  I wanted to know more about her and a lot less about the other characters.And the ending involves a gun and a shooting.  Boy, that's a first!  No originality there at all - very disappointing.In American Beauty the cinematography is glorious and the cast is magnificent, but the movie is a beautiful, hollow shell.	2.0	Hollow, man.	2002-01-02	10	6	4

Kevin Spacey is awesome in the lead role and Annette Bening is his equal.  This movie rates as among the best work that either of them has ever done.  Kevin Spacey's character is a man who is disenchanted with every aspect of his life including his marriage and his job.  He is middle aged and decides toleave his job in advertising and takes a job in a fast food joint.  He also developes a serious crush on one of the girlfriends of his teenage daughter and really embarrasses his daughter by recklessly pursuing this girl.  She attempts to be worldly but it turns out that she is a virgin who pretends to have sexual experience.  In addition, the girl teases her friend about seducing the young lady's father. Meanwhile,  his daughter falls for the boy next door who is her age and is a voyeur who takes pictures of Spacey's daughter from his bedroom window.  When she realizes that she is being photographed, she decides to partially disrobe to excite the neighbor.  The young man also reintroduces the Spacey character to drugs.  Mostly marijuana.  The father of this boy is constantly spying on his son who in the past has done drugs.  The father makes the boy give a urine sample and also locks certain parts of the house to indicate that they are off limits to the boy.The Kevin Spacey character also begins a serious exercise regimen in order to assist him in enticing his daughter's friend.  One aspect of the exercise regimine is that Spacey begins to work out with some men who are openly gay and this allows the boy's father to speculate that Spacey's character is gay as well.Suffice it to say, the daughter and wife are seriously unhappy with him and the wife embarks on an affair with a fellow real estate salesman who is much more successful in the industry than she is.  The two adulterers are caught when they drive up to the fast food restaurant where Kevin Spacey character works.The film ends in a tragic way when the teenage boy's father believes that his son is in a homosexual relationship with Kevin Spacey.  The father beats the boy and orders him out of the home and the two teenagers plan to runaway to NYC together.  Kevin Spacey's character attempts to have sex with the friend of his daughter but upon finding out that she has no previous sexual experience, he loses his desire for her.Kevin Spacey's character is murdered.  He is shot in the back of the head but it is not exactly clear who shot him.  It could be his wife or the father of the boy next door.I think that this film is magnificent and has a great cast, good direction, pace and some very comedic moments.  I would suggest that people will be watching this movie years from now."	5.0	This Is Truly a Black Comedy	2013-08-05	0	0	0

"It was the little film that could: well-known stars, a small budget and a debut director that ended up being pretty successful, even garnering the big Oscar prize. Instead of being a long epic dramatic film, American Beauty, a small suburban based film with big problems ended up winning. And just like Shakespeare in Love or A Beautiful Mind, people will absolutely love it or some who just can't stand it. I have no idea where I fit in.Lester Burnham is an unhappy married father working for a magazine. Despite working for more than 10 years, he needs to prove he still can do a good job. At home, he's got a very pedantic suburban housewife and the pre-requisite lonely confused teenage daughter. Well, a girl changes his life and soon he starts being more uninhibited including quitting his job, buying a car and telling off people who annoy him. In the meantime, his wife is also changing her life and his daughter is pursuing a relationship with an odd kid next door.I'll be honest: I saw this once before and I have to admit, I hated the thing. It seemed like artsiness to the extreme and while it's not as strongly it's still there. Roses flying out of shirts, laying in a pool of them, getting some philosophical meaning out of a flying plastic bag it seems like self-knowing importance. While there's nothing wrong with it in a film, to put a whole bunch of clever and grandiose images to me cheapens it a bit.Where the film succeeds though is its performances, except personally two. Kevin Spacey is always reliable and Thora Birch is perfect as that confused grumpy teenager. The only 2 that don't fit are Annette Bening and Wes Bentley. The former seems to overdial her performance at times being very loud and little else while Wes just seems to stare a lot. Allison Janney seems kind of wasted, not terrible. She's just very underwritten and just...""there"".The film's tagline ""look closer"" is perfect for the film as that big helicopter opening shot makes it look picturesque Americana-like but further in there's a lot of problems. Boring go-nowhere jobs, too-happy spouses, whiny daughters and oddball neighbours are very much in style right now and the film shows them off at their worst.It's highly debatable whether American Beauty deserved its Best Picture. It was up against favorites Sixth Sense and Green Mile, 2 admittedly good films but little in the way of classic Best Picture status. So it was either the better film that year or a lack of options. I liked Sixth Sense more but this film's still as enjoyable."	4.0	It's at least worth a look	2006-03-18	2	0	2

And like all other true classics, the story is one that evokes not one but many emotions in the minds of those who experience it.This movie is not about life as we'd like to have it, or life as we think some imaginary character would have it - it's about life as it *is* for the Burnhams. I can't really do this movie's humor or serious messages justice by describing them here. But my strong recommendation is to at least rent the movie and if you don't like it, nothing lost but an hour or so of your time. If you *do* like it, I can almost guarantee it's the kind of movie you'll want to watch many times over.A superb film."	5.0	This Movie Stands Alone	2001-07-31	5	1	4

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A19G60JWE86BRS	College Student	"American Beauty is a movie that uses intriguing events and eccentric characters in order to demonstrate the many different views people may have of the `American Dream'. In the film the concept of the American Dream is one of the main themes and predominantly shown throughout the different roles in the film. While American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes, uses several characters to display one's desire to posses what they believe to be the American Dream, the characters also show how superficial one's idea of this dream may be.American Beauty is a movie about an upper-middle class suburban family who may look like the perfect American family from the outside, but behind closed doors it is another story. Things aren't always as it seems.Each character in American Beauty is struggling with obtaining what they believe to be the American Dream. By examining the women and Lester in the film, it is easy to see the prevalence of this. These women are Caroline, Jane and Angela. Each is in some way trying to impress others with their looks, success, or experience.  Their `dream' is to be accepted or possibly even envied by others.Caroline is constantly trying to make herself look good and make others feel inferior. When Caroline is introducing Lester to the real estate king he embarrasses her by commenting on how he and the real estate king have met before. Caroline says, ""Honey, don't be weird"" and he replies ""OK honey, I won't be weird. I'll be whatever what you want me to be"" basically stating that she tries to control him so that she'll look good.  She pokes fun at her daughter for the way Jane dresses one day before school saying, ""Are you trying to look unattractive?"" And when her daughter replies, ""Yes"", Caroline continues with ""Well, congratulations. You've succeeded admirably"". This is just another example of Caroline trying to make others feel inferior.Jane also wants to impress others, and be admired by others. On this same day, Jane had been looking at a website for breast augmentation. This shows her insecurity with her outside appearance and she feels that one way to attract others is to enlarge her breasts and hopefully appeal to the greater male population. Her friend Angela is just as insecure.Angela is continually talking about her sexual experience, acting as if she is desired by males young and old. One day, after being asked by another girl if she ""did it"" with a photographer, she states, ""of course I did. He's like a really well known photographer. He shoots for ""Elle"" on like a regular basis. It would have been so majorly stupid of me to turn him down."" A man wrote a review on American Beauty and makes a good comment, ""Beauty queens are hiding more innocence than one would expect"" referring to Angela and how even though she talks to a great extent about previous sexual experience, despite what people believe, none of it is true. All of this fabrication of her sexual experience draws attention from Jane's father Lester.A final example of a character striving for the American Dream would be Lester. Lester's idea of the American Dream changes throughout the movie. At first, he is a man with a job that he hates, and living in a house where he is underappreciated. Yet when he meets Angela, he reverts back to his adolescence, quits his job, applies to work at a burger joint and fantasizes about being with a sixteen year old girl. His idea of the American Dream being to do and get whatever he wants. Although after Angela reveals that she is a virgin, his perception not just of her, but his life, and his mindset changes greatly. In the last few minutes that he is alive he has an epiphany and in that instant, he has a new take on the American Dream. Yet it's too late, and in the next instant, he's dead. Only then is he able to actually possess his new found American Dream of pure happiness. So is this movie saying that one can only possess their idea of the American Dream after they're dead? I don't think so. I think that for some people like Caroline and Angela, one may obtain their own superficial idea of the American Dream sometime during life, but then again, their idea of this `dream' may change over a period of time, as it did for Lester.In conclusion American Beauty uses different characters in showing how superficial some people's idea of the American Dream is. A second reviewer had a lot of negative things to say about American Beauty. One comment was that the movie had no redeemable characters and no good comes from the story. I disagree greatly with his opinion. I think that there are a lot of good lessons that can be taken from this story. One of the most important for me being, don't get so caught up in trying to impress others so that you lose sight of what you really desire. Be yourself, and be happy."	4.0	Perceptions of the American Dream in American Beauty	2006-04-05	4	2	2

Benning is glorious as the Martha Stewart-like, neglectful working mother who is more concerned about her prize roses than her misfiring family life. Spacey  exemplifies a belated return to youth, relishing even his boyhood burger  stand job as a counter-balance to the baloney-filled, useless telemarketing  position from which he bribed his way out. The kids find dashing rebuke for  the alientation of parents and society in their dreams of boiking men,  running away, and filming dead people. Stellar performance by all involved,  but particularly Thora Birch as a wayward, misunderstood teen who  eventually falls for the &quot;geek boy&quot; next door, the only miscreant  that can understand her. Deducted: one star. Reason: Mendes screenplay,  just a tad too far left of true suburban life; the charasters are flawed  beyond reality, making not one of them the redeemed soul that would have  sparked a sense of believability to the film.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AF50ULMYITS9J	Corey Slack	I know everyone has heard it, and I will say it again:  American Beauty is incredible.  Very rarely does a movie take a simple concept and create a vast and complex array of characters and their emotions.  The acting,  cinematography, script and direction are all breathtaking.  This movie  touches on a world where few can take you:  into the simplistic beauty of  everything around you.  This film has actually changed the way I look at  things, and has made me notice things I never have before.  Kevin Spacey's  performance shows his incredible range of emotional states, and all of them  are convincing.  The chemistry between Thora Birch and Wes Bently is  thorough and flows nicely, creating some charming and moving scenes.  American Beauty is an American classic.	5.0	Fabulous	2000-04-25	1	1	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3I6DTU1MS2W1Y	"Corn Soup ""sick of irony"""	This movie was good, but it is nothing compared to the kind of press it got.  Every year it seems, the media picks up on an &quot;intellectual&quot; movie to praise so they can seem intelligent. This  movie was the entry for 1999.  Kevin Spacey is entertaining as Lester and  the rest of the actors are fine, especially Thora Birch who plays the  harried daughter perfectly.Unfortunately, for me, the film seemed to  be content to go over stuff that has been worked through many times in the  1990s.  Dysfunctional families like this in 1997s Ice Storm, a few Usual  Suspects style plot twists, and a Lolita complex.  What is so special about  Sam Mendes' contribution to this film is, I do not know. It just looks like  a competently shot film with a few dream sequences in which rose petals  (hammer us with the symbolism a little more why don't you?) float around a  lot.  The Rickey Fitts character is also a little disappointing, being used  a) as a weirdo for visual purposes/ directing gimmicks and b) as a  mouthpiece for the film's philosophy-lite.It was a good movie, but if  you really want a film that looks into twisted human nature, go watch  Herzog, not Sam Mendes. If you want to learn to appreciate beauty in the  world, take a walk in the woods.  I don't think this film really knew what  it wanted to do. Did it want to teach you a lesson, or did it want to shock  you with taboos that have been gone over a hundred times?  Watch the film.  It is interesting, but watching it does not mean opening up Pandora's box  as many have suggested.	4.0	Good, But Overrated	2000-05-15	7	3	4
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3RN18NMDXVAAY	c. p.	I'd like to address some of the criticisms made in earlier reviews about this film and offer my interpretation. The main criticism seems to be twofold: firstly, the film uses cliched characters rather than realistic portraits, secondly, the film offers a simplistic message about breaking out of mundane everyday life.To begin with, yes the film does use cliches. It's deliberate. At no time does American Beauty claim to be a realistic portrayal of suburban life. It uses extremes and saturated emotions, as well as saturated colours in the cinematography, to offer an incisive, sarcastic, and over the top criticism of Western Culture. (Althought the film is set in suburban America I think it could have been set in the affluent suburbs of many Western nations and still have been apt.) The characters are consciously and obviously stereotyped - the middle aged man in the throws of a mid life crisis, the shallow and ambitious real estate agent, the beautiful cheerleader, the latently homosexual marine - but we are encouraged to recognise these as stereotypes and to focus on the way in which these figures struggle with the details, desires, and fears of their world. It is a hypereality that is being presented, and is which is used to mock and criticise the actual.Some have seen the film as little more than a saccharine message about being true to yourself in the face of mediocrity. I think it is a film about the impossibility of just that. There is no happy ending, no comfortable resolution, Lester ends up dead, and those around him frustrated, imprisoned, and weary. It's a film about the way in which society succeeds in alienating us from ourselves and each other, not about trite attempts to break out. Lester's job quitting and his buffing up don't succeed in bringing him happiness. Nor does Caroline's affair or rifle range education. It is the small, temporal moments that give us pleasure: small, fleeting visions of beauty in a cold and frustrating world. Overall, the film ends on a sour note (gorgeously contradicted by the score) and argues that simply refusing to cooperate doesn't stop the machine from turning.	4.0	misunderstood	2002-10-22	41	33	8
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A364W6U6YL219D	"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy"""	"American Beauty (1999) Lester and Carolyn Burnham seem to have it all: a nice house, two well-paid jobs, a couple of expensive cars, and a beautiful daughter. But as is so often true in these modern times, a lot of dysfunction hides behind the mask of happy normalcy.In truth, Lester (Kevin Spacey) is going middle age crazy, pining for his carefree youth and making goo-goo eyes at his daughter's Lolita-like best friend. Carolyn (Annette Bening) has discovered that ""having it all"" isn't nearly enough; she throws herself into her real estate job to try to compensate. And the daughter is going through that economy sized variety pack of teen angst, ranging from insecurity to parent loathing. Add in a set of new next door neighbors with their own problems (Dad's a bigoted ex-Marine; Mom's a zoned out space case, and son is a fairly creepy video voyeur); stir them all together well, and you have the perfect recipe for suburban disaster.Director Sam Mendes, writer Alan Bell, and especially the actors make the most of this dramatic black comedy. The mix is perfectly realized, with laugh out loud scenes that nonetheless have a sense of tragedy and doom about them.Writer Ball has a background in sitcoms, so it's no surprise that ther is a lot of sharp tongued verbal byplay. More surprising is how well a thirty-four year old director can guide his actors through the minefield of fortysomething neuroses. But then, you don't hire actors like Spacey and Bening because they'll do a mean karaoke at the wrap party. Spacey is as excellent as he is expected to be, and he is matched scene for scene by the slightly underrated Bening. The rest of the cast lend fine support, with newcomer Wes Bentley standing out.This is a quirky, somewhat unusual film, with a few stylized fantasy scenes that add to the flavor overall. If you enjoy such productions, this is definitely a good choice to sink your teeth into. Also with Peter Gallagher (Summer Lovers) and Chris Cooper (Lone Star)."	4.0	Seems like the perfect life.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	I didn't read all 600+ reviews for American Beauty listed on the Amazon site, but a cursory look gives me the impression that people get very polarised over this movie, and I can't understand why.  Is it an art movie?  Not really.  But it's as close as a Hollywood movie is likely to get, I suppose.  The acting is superb, but the characters are very two-dimensional.  Surprisingly, the most realistic character (to me) was the &quot;Beauty&quot; herself, Angela, who, as the object of male fantasies, would normally be the most two-dimensional.  So, while I enjoyed the movie, I don't care to watch it over and over.  It is dark, but heartwarming in its way, and parts are very funny as well.The DVD additives are also only okay.  There is a director's commentary (the writer also is on the track, but says very little), but it focusses much more on technical issues (how shots were set up, lighting effects, etc.) rather than the more interesting (to me) and probably more appropriate plot issues.  There is a storyboard presentation (which goes on for a grueling hour), from which you learn little more than you could learn from the commentary.  The making-of feature is very short.  All in all, for something called the &quot;Awards Edition&quot;, there's little here worth having over what appears on the video.Thus, while I enjoyed the movie, and can understand why the Academy and others gave it some awards, I don't think it's worth spending the money to buy it.	3.0	Okay movie on an okay DVD	2001-05-30	5	3	2

Such is the case of Alan Ball's excellent script; Sam Mendes' direction; and the exemplary acting of an uparalleled group of actors.In ""American Beauty"", viewers will find themselves rooting cheerfully for Lester Burnham, the movies key character brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey.  Burnham is a man going through a mid-life crisis slash awakening in a plot that turns out to be a mystery, drama, tragic comedy and satire all rolled into a finely crafted story.This film dares to show the sarcastic contradictions that occur in everyday life.  For those quick to judge others, this will hopefully be an eye opener as to what the effects of those judgments can have on life and death.I think most viewers will be able to relate to at least one of the unique characters created in this picture, which garnered 5 Oscars, including Best Picture, in 1999.  Personally, I fell in love and lust respectively with Thora Birch and Mena Suvari.  The other characters are brought to life in exemplary fashion by Spacey, Annette Bening, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Peter Gallagher, Allison Janey and Scott Bakula.  They all interact together and astutely show the everyday foibles, humor, tragedy and other unique circumstances that occur in suburban life.If you've already seen ""American Beauty"", you know how great it is; if you haven't viewed it yet, do so immediately--you won't regret it..."	5.0	"This Film Truly is an ""American Beauty"""	2010-09-25	2	1	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A23S9U8NZSRRD8	C. Spencer	Often as not the hype attached to new releases is totally unjustified. But it is nearly always the case with Hollywood's blockbuster generation of mind-numbing, effects heavy movies. Films such as Titanic,Armageddon,Phantom Menace,Saving Private Ryan and the  vomit-inducing Forrest Gump seem to lack any real depth. There is no  attempt to make the audience think or reflect on life in general. American  Beauty made me realise that America was still capable of producing  thought-provoking films in the way it used to.  Contrary to other reviews  I've read on these pages it does not suggest we all ditch our wonderful  family lives to chase 16 year old girls.It merely suggests that we all live  our lives the way we really wish to live them and not feel the need to  conform to some pre-written script.  Rather than fulfilling his role in a farcical marriage that has run it's  natural length of time, Lester opts out and finds out what he's really  about ,starts living his life again ,wakes up basically.  His pursuit of his daughter's best-friend could be a  symbol of his quest to find his lost-youth. Kevin Spacey is a wonderfully  charismatic actor and this will no doubt attract an audience who will not  be prepared for a dark portrayal of life as presented in this film. I think  it has a lot to say about the hypocrisy of the times we live in and is  certainly not easy viewing.  Don't watch it if you think the  world is some wonderful utopian paradise and that all movies should try to  represent this. Certainly don't watch it with your mum!

It was my treat. It intriqued me that the so call &quot;typical American culture&quot; gave this movie so many rewards and dared to call its content &quot;beautiful&quot;.  The movie was  well done and portrayed a reality often disguised in this society:  What  really goes on in our minds and what has the typical American family  become? I like this movie because it shows a truth that is often ignored  and rarely mentioned.  SEX.  True, today we are more open to talk about  it.  However, we do not dare to share the gross and unaccepted thoughts  that linger in our minds. This movie gives an example of what may happen if  those thoughts were played out.  It doesn't surprise me what does happen.  What surprises me and horrifies me is that people would look at this movie  and venture to follow it. A sollution movie needs to be done.  This movie  tells us what happens if we dwell on the sins the mind chooses to capture  enough to live them out.  American Beauty warns us what ugliness looks  like.  The only beauty in this movie is that it brings the truth of the  mind out into the light. I'd recommend this movie not as entertainment, for  it is quite distrubing to watch, but as a piece for serious discussion on  some of the key issues that plague our society today. This movie is  inappropriate for those under 13 and needs a parent for those under 18 or  those who are not married.  If you are addicted to sex, the sexual content  may cloud the real issues of this movie and I'd advise you not to see it.

This film follows Lester (Spacey) as he retells the events leading up to his untimly death.  The heart and soul of this film is that all that makes Lester happy eventually kills him.  Lester is hitting his mid-life crisis.  He's got a bad marriage (his wife played by Benning) and a bad relationship with his daughter played by Thora Birch.  He hates his job and hates his boss and pretty much hates his life in general.  Now he gets new neighbors...neighbors that bring both newfound life and eventual death.  His neighbors son is a pot smoking, pot selling teenager obsessing about Lester as well as his teenage daughter...he sells pot to Lester and has sex with his daughter.  Lester quits his job and starts working at a burger place...fantisizes about his daughters cheerleader friend who is in turn fantisizing about him...he starts working out, getting in shape...He's trying to recapture his youth...the days when he was happy with where his life was headed and didn't feel so trapped in a dead end marriage in this black hole that leads him nowhere but around and around and around...He's tired of being miserable.  I wished him the best but you know it can't last when he tells you in the beginning that he's dead.

It's obviously a satire on the stereotypical suburban life, and the acting in the movie is spectacular, especially Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning.  The film has its funny moments, and its very dramatic moments, and it's an extremely well-done movie.  The story is very deep, and it stirs thought from the viewer when it's over, and it also has a great message:  enjoy all the little things that are beautiful in life, while you still can, because they're all over the place.  I definitely recommend this movie."	5.0	Brilliant movie	2003-06-26	2	0	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1R8AO9XASQ15C	Daniel A. Marsh	"I used to have arguments with people at work over whether ""American Beauty"" is a movie primarily for guys. It is told, after all, strictly from a man's perspective -- Lester Burnham's, namely, since after all, he is dead and presumably all knowing. Maybe that is why Caroline Burnham is portrayed as such a shrew, and why virtually everyone else in the picture is viewed with such cold-hearted negativity -- including the children. That is how Lester experienced them, or imagined himself experiencing them. So, from his rather narrow point of view, the portrayals do make sense.Such arguments are irrelevent, but they do make a point: ""American Beauty"" is a film you can't help but talk about and play over and over in your mind. For a while there back in 1999, I had the dazzling idea that movies were going to actually get better ... only to see an endless supply of greedy sequels pile into the multiplexes, making a film like ""American Beauty"" all the more rare and, well, beautiful.People who complain about the movie's subject matter, about its language and sexuality, who actually walked out of the theater ... well, all I can say is, they should figure out in advance what a movie is about and decide beforehand whether it's something they want to pay to see. The only movie I ever walked out of was ""Battlefield Earth,"" and only because it was stupid to the point of mental paralysis. ""American Beauty"" may make you angry, but it is not stupid, or dirty, or vulgar. That some people found it shocking may say more about them than about the quality of the movie.First and foremost, ""American Beauty"" is a comedy, and one of the blackest since, I dunno, ""Dr. Strangelove,"" or maybe ""MASH."" It is like a television sitcom pushed to the edge of nightmare, with the classical sitcom ""dad"" (Kevin Spacey) waking up to a new life and realizing that he's surrounded not just by boring, uninteresting people, but crazy, selfish, materialistic people. He realizes he doesn't really know his wife and that they should rekindle what they had before Grown Up Life intruded. He realizes he hasn't been communicating with his self-absorbed daughter, and that although he should do something about it, he doesn't quite know what. He realizes he had a lot more fun when he was a kid. He realizes his job sucks. And he realizes that he is, indeed, a sexual creature, though the object of his obsession (Mena Suvari, wonderful) makes him more of a pervert than a stud.The movie is a dark, nighttime journey through Lester's mind, and though it expands to include the next-door neighbors and their troubled lives, it is truly limited to his perspective and is, in fact, about him and no one else. Yeah, his activities border on criminal, and no, you shouldn't really mix weight-lifting with dope smoking and beer guzzling, but he's burning off 20 wasted years, and he does finally come around at the end.The supremely shocking thing is that Lester meets his ultimate fate just at the moment that he realizes life maybe ain't so bad, after all. He's robbed of his life just when he learns to appreciate it. How else to describe it, but as a cosmic jest at Lester's expense?The movie is excellent on every level, from the tremendous performances to the fantastic screenplay to Sam Mendes' atmospheric direction. It is by turns hilariously funny and somberly dramatic. It is unpredictable and insightful about the way Americans live, a quality I cherish above any CGI effect you can imagine. That it is just a little cold, just a little austere, and just a little too pessimistic, is a flaw I'm willing to live with because othewise there is so much much to enjoy here. Was it honestly the best picture of a great year at the movies, a year that saw the release of ""Magnolia,"" ""The Green Mile,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Fight Club""? Yeah. It was."	4.0	Movie for guys?	2003-10-12	3	1	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AQ990HW13DP08	Daniel B. Clendenin	This film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, but I thought it was weak. Every character in the film is pathologically dysfunctional, but the bad part is that they are superficial, predictable, and unbelievable stereotypes. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), age 42, is a loser, and he knows he is a loser. His wife and teenage daughter hate him, for good reasons. Not to worry, he rejuvenates himself by seducing Angela, his daughter's best friend, quitting his job, working out and drinking smoothies, listening to Pink Floyd and Bob Dylan, smoking dope, throwing dishes against the wall, getting a new job at Smiley's Hamburgers, and buying a 1970 Pontiac Firebird. Self destruction as personal makeover? Life is beautiful, as he proclaims at the end of the film? Yeah, right. His wife Carolyn is an obsessive phony who lives only for image and finds her own authenticity by bedding her chief real estate competitor. Daughter Jane runs off with the next door classmate, Ricky, a drug dealing voyeur who spent two years in a mental hospital because of his abusive Marine Colonel dad who wrongly thinks he is gay, even while, apparently, he himself is gay. The real, token gay couple lives a few houses down. Just your average suburban neighborhood. Mid life crises are not funny, and it is too bad that director Sam Mendes did not help Lester deal with his in an interesting or compelling way.	3.0	overrated and unconvincing	2007-01-24	23	8	15
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2BIWMWF995A7Y	DANIEL G. MADIGAN	American Beauty is about the marriage of a guy who is at best deep at the surface. His recollections of his past at the end are none too deep either..they're shot in black and white and reminded me of early 60's nostalgia pieces like To Kill A Mockingbird, utterly unconvincing.Annette Benning and Kevin Spacey as husband and wife(brillantly played by both) have entered the competitive world of America and it is shattering their marriage and their integrity. They make absurd choices that entrap them further, so that finally murder and death wishes(she wants to shoot him and he lusts for a Lolita looka like and deals with drugs with a teenager , which looks like gay sex to the teen's father..all of it crazy and risky) become suitable options for this couple who do anyhting but RULE.The children of American Beauty are anti- American Dream in every way; their vocabulary is cynical jargon designed to disarm and also to protect them from the crushing world of adult relationships in which they find themselves asked to model. They look better than the adults aS they see through the sexuaL and psychological messes in front of them. They have to survive and do so with some imagination, except for the blonde girl who is Spacey's object of desire; she's dull, unimaginative, and one of them puts it, sadly knows it.The Marine Major's wife with her catatonia is superb; she typifies the only stance one could take in this very real world of realtionships..silence and immobility, a willed retreat into madness as a seal on whatever humanity she has left.The end  of the film shakes it all up, and the film turns into a who dunnit with the principal parties as potential suspects of murder. This throws the film into another genre..a sort of Agatha Christie plot, where Miss Marple will come and figure it all out. Kevinb Spacey leaves a puzzle behind, but it is a bland one, easy to decipher..there';s nothing worth the trouble in this world, and kids in it know it.American Beauty as a term and not a title, seen in part in the sexy use of rose petals, is a fading illusion, a cliche, and  truth, as Spacey alludes to in the end,  is nowhere to be found in this environment..as truth seems to be at the bottom of a bottomless well...like the dreams they all have, fractured by their own loneliness and sad belief that marriage is as good as it gets, or that independent living without depth is better. the gay guys  too have unfortunately assimilated and they look bad, ignoring the reality of homophobia, not wrestling with any issues at all. Part of the issues not faced by the gay couple is the marine next door trying to forge a desperate realtionship with Kevin Spacey, that becomes ultimately deadly, unfulfilled, and a bit shocking in its conclusion, but maybe the only complete intercourse in the film..it gets a little beyond the Hitler plate that the Marine keeps under glass, and closer to the white bag in motion, not stagnant. But this is all framed in a world of absurdity.See this film and never mind the reviews of those who only saw it on video tape with pizza interruptions etc...It's for adults, and for people who have a background and a foreground.	5.0	Great Film In Every Way	2000-10-20	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A39LRCAB9G8F21	Daniel H. Hawkins	As an aspiring screenwriter, I was really impressed by the extra features on this DVD.  My favorite feature works on a PC with a DVD; unfortunately it doesn't work on your TV's DVD player.  It contains a copy of the script broken up in chapters.  You can read each part of the script and play that part of the movie in a small separate window while you read along.  I'm hoping this will be an excellent learning tool for me.Now for the movie itself:  I loved it.  I wish I could give it four and a half stars since I reserve those 5 star ratings for true classics.  It remains to be seen yet if this becomes a real classic.  There was a line in Kevin Spacey's voiceover that goes something like this:  &quot;You know, it's been said that every day is the first day of the rest of your life.  And that's true of every day except one:  the day you die.&quot;  I was struck by this line the very first time I watched this movie in the theater, and I instantly wished that I had written it.  This is a tribute to Alan Ball, who wrote a fantastic script.	4.0	Excellent DVD	2001-02-09	3	1	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	American Beauty is not one of those movies you simply watch and quickly forget, and it's awfully hard to review.  Only once have I walked away in mid-review, feeling quite unable to do a subject justice, but I am ready now to start again and offer my own thoughts on this extraordinary film.  You know a film is something special when you wonder so many people could possibly like it.  I think American Beauty can justifiably be called quite weird, and the treatment of subjects such as a relationship between a forty-two-year-old man and a seventeen-year-old girl, complete family dysfunctionality, and murder most foul doesn't normally result in critical as well as box office success, not to mention such honors as Best Picture awards.  One thing this movie certainly has going for it is its shockingly original nature; no one had made a movie quite like this before.  What strikes me as really quite amazing is the fact that, despite all the buzz about this movie, I still had little idea of what to expect once I finally watched it for myself.  Then there is the talented cast; I can take or leave Kevin Spacey, and I do not like Annette Bening, but I can't deny their talents; I will admit that Mena Suvari was a prime motivator in my own initial attraction to this movie, though.  All told, each member of the cast gave a brilliant performance.  Then there is the incredible musical score, as well as the mesmerizing cinematography.  Of course, the heart of American Beauty is its story.The characters in this film are all living lives of quiet (sometimes not so quiet) desperation, and that is the source of the appeal to so many people.  Today's reality is unreality.  Some individuals might think they want nothing more than a normal life, but I believe that, deep down, no one wants to be ordinary.  Everyone wants to find a meaning for his/her life, even those who convince themselves otherwise.  Who of us is really happy?  American Beauty helps us acknowledge our own dreams of meaning and understanding, while at the same time it offers a level of comfort to those of us conscious of our unfulfilling lives.  The characters in this film come off as quite real, albeit a surreal form of real, and they are screwed up more than we are.  Lester Burnham even succeeds in finding a part of what he has been missing all his life, although that incredibly victorious moment is cut short at the end.  No one is whom they claim to be here, each character hiding secrets that are ultimately brought to light in the hypnotizing final moments; there are some significant revelations that many viewers may not anticipate.  These characters aren't truly fake, however; they are just unhappy.  While all of this intense emotional drama could well afflict the viewer with something akin to depression, American Beauty somehow manages to deliver a message of, if not hope then at least understanding and mutual sympathy, supporting us with many moments of dark comedy along the way, holding our hands down the long passage to the ultimate door of revelation.  And it is the most troubled individual of all who shows us that there is beauty in even the ugliest of circumstances, if we will just stop and look for it.	5.0	A mesmerizing experience for both mind and soul	2003-05-16	5	3	2

As the movie progresses you become increasing aware that nothing could be further from the truth. A fascinating look at responsibility and discovery of what is really important in life.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2GYX971VETQBV	Daniel R. Sanderman	"""American Beauty"" is a truly rare film, in my opinion.  But not in the way that most reviewers will tell you.  I could certainly mention the awards it has won, its delicate play of satire, etc.  But it is rare to me because it is one of the few films I can watch over and over and never tire.  The cast is alive in this film, the emotions are real, and it's all in your face.  The chemistry that is created on-screen in this film is unparalleled in recent years.  It definitely has the feel of a play, where the cast is not separated from each other.  It's quite likely that Sam Mendes brought this attribute from his stage experience and introduced it to the film.  I can only say that it works marvelously.  Kevin Spacey is brilliant and Annette Bening manages to create sympathy for a character to whom I truly did not want to become attached.A dear friend of mine is disturbed by the ""perverse"" sexual content in the film.  I can only say that this film is dealing with that perversity and finding that it is, perhaps, more natural and less perverse than we may think.  In the very least, it is an aspect of our lives that is right under our noses whether or not we are aware of it.  This film manages to present America, in all of its faults and failures.  And yet out of those faults, life as we know it emerges.  And life is a wonderful thing, any way you slice it.With great directing, a truly memorable cast, and a stirring soundtrack, ""American Beauty"" promises to be a film that I will continue to watch many years to come.  The DVD translates the film beautifully, and the special features are definitely worth a look."	5.0	America, Right Under Our Noses	2003-12-13	4	3	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3BJHQSDEPOPTJ	Dan Reef	What &quot;American Beauty&quot; is supposed to be about involves a dysfunctional American suburban family who suffers uncommon everyday social problems. The idea of the dad being attracted to her daughter's friend is more frequent in real life than most people believe. But, I don't think it was done right when Kevin Spacey did drugs and other things to impress her. This didn't show any reaction from his daughter. This was a lot like a Jerry Springer episode.The entire main idea of this movie was very flawed because reaction to the situation was only seen through the eyes of Kevin Spacey: not of his wife or his daughter. It's like your looking for the hamburger buns and you're obviously in the dairy section. If you study this movie after you watch it a few times, you'll probably get the REAL idea of it.	2.0	&quot;A Misleading Story&quot;	2001-02-27	11	4	7

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A31LHED3SKLWVB	Darren	"Taboo subject-matter, such as a 42-year-old man's infatuation with a 16-year-old girl, is really just impossible to depict honestly ... unless you're a literary master like Vladimir Nabokov (please note that I'm referring to the novel, not any filmed version of ""Lolita""), and, I'm sorry to say, Alan Ball is not quite Nabokov.  Hence the rose-petals here, I suppose.  Of course, no man has fantasies like Kevin Spacey has about Mena Suvari; the actual daydreams would be far dirtier.  But an honest depiction would be morally repugnant to viewers, so we're presented with weird symbolic substitutes.  I might have recommended that there be no ""fantasies"" at all -- Spacey and the script make it funnily abundant that his character is in the grips of mid-life dotage already without such literal-minded symbolism.  But, throughout ""American Beauty"", Ball demonstrates that he doesn't trust the audience's acumen about his story; all too often, he apparently feels that he must spell everything out for us in the simplest possible way.  The worst symbolic bit:  a plastic bag, blowing in the breeze.  What's that supposed to be? -- the flimsy human soul, buffeted about by the universe?  Or something so beautiful that it makes your heart burst, as Wes Bentley says with tears welling up?  Oh come on now!With the sole exception of Kevin Spacey's Lester, all the adults in the film are cartoons, constructed to bring home various points about the presumed horrible inadequacies of suburbia.  We have: the gay couple who bring fruit baskets to new neighbors and admire the neighbor lady's rose garden; the smarmy boss; the violent, seething, repressed Marine father and his lobotomized wife; and, worst of all, Annette Bening as Spacey's spouse, a sort of harpy version of Daffy Duck.  Bening's character is not believable.  Which would be OK if the movie wasn't more or less a sober drama with some comic points.  She might work in a total farce or perhaps in a Bunuel picture.  But here, she's just a punching bag for Spacey's mid-life crisis.  Bening, by the way, tries her very best to wring as much humanity as she can from the character -- she's a truly great actor, let me say at once -- but the script just won't set her free.  Two other great actors, Chris Cooper and Allison Janney, labor under the same one-dimensional imprisonment.  Bening, Cooper, and Janney are like Zod and his henchmen from ""Superman 2"", trapped in a thin plane of glass.  I can't believe a movie with such talented actors can't find more for them to do.The kids, Thora Birch as the miserable teenage daughter, Mena Suvari as her slutty friend, and Wes Bentley as her boyfriend, fare much better than their elders.  Perhaps this is because kids are easier to write than adults, and their problems seem one-dimensional, anyway.  In particular, I thought the whole scene late in the film between Spacey and Suvari was well-written and especially well-performed:  a seduction, a nervous trembling from one party and a rather ruthless desire from another, and an admission that breaks the whole spell.  Difficult to execute, but done superbly.  Not all the other dramatic crises are done as well, though.While this review has mostly focused on what I think are its shortcomings, I do have to say that Kevin Spacey (and to a lesser degree, the kids) engage us and drive things forward.  Some bits are quite well-written and funny.  It's not a bad picture, by any means.  But I do think the criticisms that Ball is grinding a few axes are eminently fair.  Perhaps a different writer would have laid down the axe and tried for a little more verisimilitude:  the result might have been a deeper, more compassionate film than what we have here.  3 out of 5."	3.0	A plastic bag blowing in the breeze	2013-10-15	1	0	1

Stop pretending to be this normal, straight laced, 'make room for daddy' household and see life for what it truly is... beautiful beyond words.  There is an intertwined, complex weave between all our lives and that is the beauty of living.  Not everyone is the same and there is no such thing as &quot;normal&quot; except for the people who are too afraid to open up and embrace our differences (racists, ignorant people, fanatical religous groups).  If we were all the same wouldn't it be a very boring and ORDINARY world - difference makes it exciting, unique, and yes sometimes strange and wierd.  Take the good with the bad.I loved this movie because it moves and inspires me.  It is more than eye candy pandering to the lowest intellectual level (Titanic, Matrix, Die Hard, Zorro, and Timecop).  This movie means something and people who don't like it are afraid to admit how realistic it is.  We all have dysfunction in our lives, no one is the typical 'leave it to beaver' family.  This movie shows us the beauty of our differences with a style and story like no other.  This movie didn't win enough awards in my opinion. If your liked this movie you will love &quot;Magnolia&quot; with Tom Cruise - it is another realistic depiction of the sad and beautiful world we live in.	5.0	Spec-----tacular	2000-12-01	12	6	6
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A27FR2C67JPDRS	Daryl B	This film is very, very good.  The story slowly strips away the layers that hides the dysfunction of this suburban American family.  While they may look like the perfect family in a nice, big home with good jobs, we see that happiness is the one thing each member lacks.  The complex relationships in this film are so interesting to watch and the mood, both dark and comic, is meshed perfectly.  Kevin Spacey, most definitely, deserved the Oscar he received for this film and the award for &quot;Best Picture&quot; was cinematic justice.  Alan Ball (who created the equally brilliant HBO series, &quot;Six Feet Under) is a genius as far as I'm concerned.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AWLFVCT9128JV	"Dave_42 ""Dave_42"""	"In a time when Hollywood seems to put out the same films over and over, it is refreshing to see an original movie like ""American Beauty"".  The movie premiered on September 8th, 1999 in Los Angeles California.  It won 5 Academy Awards, including:  Best Actor in a Leading Role (Kevin Spacey), Best Cinematography (Conrad L. Hall), Best Director (Sam Mendes), Best Picture (Bruce Cohen, Dan Jinks), and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen (Alan Ball).  It was also nominated for three other awards, including:  Best Actress in a Leading Role (Annette Bening), Best Editing (Tariq Anwar), and Best Music, Original Score (Thomas Newman).This is a great movie from all aspects, and that starts with a superb script.  The script gives us the characters with whom the audience can identify, and dialogue and situations which are both humorous and poignant.  Next we have the cinematography which is simply beautiful, and is accented wonderfully by the score.  Finally, there is the acting which is excellent throughout.  While Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening received the nominations, the performances of Thora Birch, Ricky Fitts, Angela Hayes, and Chris Cooper are all very good, and even the more minor roles of Peter Gallagher and Allison Janney contribute significantly to the overall feel of the movie.I have seen this movie at least five times now, and each time I have focused on different aspects and themes of the story.  The first viewing, assuming it hasn't been spoiled; one gets the initial surprises at the end of the movie.  Subsequent viewing though are still just as good, because one notices more the overall themes: the lack of communication, the different facades that the characters wear, the loneliness of the characters, even when they are together.  Certainly these themes interrelate, but it is also interesting to look at each on its own to see how the director used the camera, the actors, and the music to show them to the audience.The DVD includes several special features, but it would be worth owning even if it only contained the movie.  My favorite feature would be the commentary with Director Sam Mendes and Writer Alan Ball.  There is also a behind-the-scenes featurette, a Storyboard Presentation with additional commentary by Sam Mendes and the Director of Photography, Conrad L. Hall, the cast and crew biographies, production notes, and trailers for the movie.  There are also some DVD-ROM features which you can look at on your computer.If you are looking for a typical action movie or romantic comedy, then this is not the movie you want to see, but if you are looking for a unique and original movie that will restore your faith in the ability of the film industry to produce something other than sequels and remakes, then this is for you."	5.0	Unique And Original	2006-04-14	16	14	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2CF2CJ59NGADL	David Ash	This movie, like the more recently released The Assassination of Richard Nixon, is centered around a middle aged man whose midlife crisis is causing his life to fall apart.  However, in this movie, unlike Assassination, the man in question (Kevin Spacey) has a bit more of a sense of humor.  The story begins with Spacey narrating from a place of being recently dead--so we know from the start that the movie is going to end tragically, although we do not know how.  Spacey seems, however, to be quite okay with the idea of being deceased.Spacey is, basically, bored with his life.  He seems uninspired with his work and, in any event, there are rumors of downsizing when a new boss is hired.  His wife (Annette Benning) is more motivated, although not entirely successful, in her work as a real estate agent, and seems a bit disgusted with her husband's lackluster career.  Their relationship seems somewhat loveless (Spacey describes masturbating in the shower as the high point of his day).  His daughter (Thora Birch) is also very bored with life, and hangs out with a cheerleader friend (Mena Suvari) for whom Spacey eventually develops a strong crush.The Fitts family moves in next door.  The father, a Colonel (Chris Cooper), is homophobic (and, we later discover, ironically also a closet gay) and abusive with his son and most likely his wife.  The mother (Allison Janney) is nearly catatonic for unexplained reasons that may have to do with abuse by Cooper.  The son (Wes Bentley) has spent time in a psych ward, but is also secretly a drug dealer and a rather successful one at that.These characters set the stage for the characters' various antics that follow.  Spacey is ultimately fired from his job, but blackmails his employer into a hefty severance package.  He starts smoking marijuana with Bentley and develops a strong crush for Birch's friend Suvari when he overhears her expressing an interest in sleeping with him.  He uses the money from the severance package to buy a new car and basically starts living the life he wished he'd had in his youth.Benning is increasingly disgusted with her husband's behavior--it seems he can do no right in her eyes--he is disgusted with him masturbating but equally disgusted with the idea of having sex with him.  She is much more attracted to the top local real estate agent, with whom she has an affair both because she finds him sexy and because she hopes to learn more about selling real estate from him.16-year-old Birch is initially disgusted by Bentley's voyeuristic habits--he has a nasty habit of following her around and filming her with his camcorder.  Yet she eventually discovers his love for beauty in everything that he films, and, after a confrontation with her mother, poses bare breasted in the window as Bentley films her from next door.  Bentley is caught and violently confronted by his Marine Corps father.This sets in motion the sequence of events that lead to the film's tragic end.  What is beautiful about this film is that the characters are not in total denial about their lives unravelling.  They know what is happening--the career problems, the marital breakdown, and the affairs--and yet all of the central characters, in their own way, are still able to see the beauty in life and to enjoy the positive, even with everything that is going wrong.  In fact, it is perhaps because of the pervasive theme of tragedy that they are more able to stop and enjoy life when given the opportunity.So--in many ways, not an altogether happy movie, and yet a surprisingly uplifting one give the final outcome.  A well earned Oscar for best picture.	5.0	beauty, comedy, and tragedy at the same time	2005-01-19	6	4	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1T633YVOAU1YN	David C. Glebe	"I'd heard a lot of good things about this movie, including the ""Best Picture"" Oscar, but I'd never seen it until recently.  Surprisingly, it was pretty disappointing because of all of the stupid little things that didn't make sense.  When I watch a movie, I am perfectly willing to buy ""the premise,"" and to suspend my disbelief and pretend that I'm watching some actual story, not just a bunch of actors on a set saying lines.  So, when the movie begins, I'm really willing to give it a chance until....until.....the movie gets to some point where I just say to myself ""Yeah, right.""  Which means that whatever just happened has violated ""the premise"" of the story (probably because of the writer's laziness or poor editing), and is making the story unbelievable, unreal, contrived, and frankly, just stupid.  So that was my problem with this movie -- too much stuff in it was just plain STUPID.So, where to begin?Well, this movie takes itself so seriously that it actually comes with its own built-in hype, which TELLS you, in kind of an unofficial subtitle, to ""look closer.""  Okay, fine.  So you meet the Burnham family right up front, and within seconds all three of them come off as superficial, shallow, empty, bored and boring people.  Then the movie goes on, and on, and on, and what happens?  These characters have a bunch of little episodes that reveal each of them as -- shallow, empty, and boring people.  That's the result of ""looking closer,"" which is not what you expect.  Because when someone says ""look closer,"" aren't they implying that you will see something deeper and more meaningful and more important than the appearance you see at first glance?  Sure they are.  But here, when you ""look closer"" at these superficial people, YOU SEE EXACTLY THE SAME THING -- SUPERFICIAL PEOPLE, EXCEPT AT A CLOSER RANGE.  So what?I guess to be fair you might say that Spacey's character finally shows a LITTLE depth at the very end of the movie, and apparently ""grows up"" a little bit when he decides not to sexually molest his daughter's friend (how NICE of him to decide not to commit statutory rape, eh?) but really, there isn't much more to it than that.But besides the characterization problem, there are just lots of stupid little things that are very distracting, and show a remarkable sloppiness.  Why the other reviewers chose to ignore these things is puzzling to me.Some examples --The family's house -- they live in this weird house that is like a reverse Tardis from Dr. Who.  That is, from the inside it's a rather modest two-bedroom house, but from the outside it's a rather large 4-5 bedroom house, at least double the size that the interior shots reveal.  Whaddup widdat?  Another thing about the house is that, from the outside, where it appears huge, it would seem to be way more expensive than the Burnhams could afford, especially since Spacey has some dead-end job where he works from a CUBICLE.  What does that mean?  (Come on, LOOK CLOSER.)  It means he doesn't make much money.  So how can he and his wife afford that $500K mansion?  Yet another weird thing about the house -- it has all these wide-open windows, without blinds or curtains, even in the garage, so that the neighbors can conveniently watch (and film!) things that happen in the house.  Yeah, right -- happens every day.  So, so ""real,"" huh?Spacey's sexual fixation on his daughter's friend, Angela -- I guess it doesn't bother Spacey that Angela is a minor because she projects a lot of sexuality.  Okay, fine.  But then he fantasizes about her while he's lying in bed, and what's his fantasy?  That she's lying in a bed of rose petals, with various petals strategically placed over her otherwise naked body.  Yeah, right.  As if that's the way he would be imagining her, with stupid rose petals covering her up.  Yeah right, raised to the tenth power.  No man on earth would have that fantasy.  In fact, no man since the beginning of the human species would have that fantasy.  Period.  But the strange thing is, that near the end of the movie, when he is finally about to have sex with her, she actually does expose her breasts, which was totally UN-necessary to the scene or the story.  Purely gratuituous nudity, and thus insulting to the viewer.  But when Angela's nudity WOULD have been perfectly appropriate, in the fantasy sequence, THEN she's covered up.  Makes no sense.Speaking of nudity, there is also a brief shot of Jane in a topless state, also purely gratuituous, but not only that, the shot shows how extremely well-endowed she is, and yet she is saving up her money to have breast enlargement surgery.  Huh?  After Jane's nude shot, I had to rewind to the beginning because I thought, ""she must actually want a breast reduction, right?""  But no, in the beginning of the movie she is worried about being under-endowed in the breast department -- but by her nude scene, she has the over-developed body of a Vegas stripper.  Didn't anyone read both parts of the script?Going back to Angela for a minute, at the end of the film Spacey is apparently going to have sex with her right there IN HIS LIVING ROOM, when his daughter and her boyfriend are upstairs and when his wife can walk in at any minute -- yeah, right.  It's not stupid enough that he's going to risk going to jail for rape, we're supposed to believe that if someone walks into the room, he'll just ignore them, right?There are so many other stupid things like that.  The drug-dealing neighbor kid hides his pot in a drawer with a fake bottom -- as if nobody would EVER think of something so clever to hide stuff, especially his suspicious father.  But on top of this, the kid also keeps small containers of ""clean urine"" in the refrigerator in his room -- NOT HIDDEN AT ALL FROM HIS NOSY FATHER.  Why does he hide the pot, but not the urine?  Yeah, right.  Speaking of the father next door, apparently he is a Shao Lin monk in disguise, and can therefore ""walk through walls,"" because at the end of the film, although he is SOAKING WET from the rain, he's able to walk right into Spacey's kitchen, come right up behind him and shoot his pistol, all with such absolute silence and stealth that Spacey doesn't know that the dripping wet father is standing there, inches behind him.  Yeah, right.One of my favorite stupid scenes, though, is when Bening comes home and sees Spacey's new classic muscle car, which he just bought because it's something he ""always wanted.""  Then a few minutes later, he is reprimanding Bening for having bought a $4,000 silk couch, telling her that it's just ""a thing,"" and not important, and that his new non-material viewpoint allows him to see this profound truth, etc.  Well, what about the $25,000 that HE just spent on that ""thing"" in the driveway?  What's the big difference?  And then, Spacey gets a ""fun"" and ""carefree"" job at a fast food place after he quits his old job -- as if that kind minimum wage job is anything but pure drudgery and hard work, not ""fun"" at all.  Why isn't he shown mopping the floors and emptying the trash into the stinking dumpster out back?  That's what he'd really be doing in such a ""fun"" job.  And why don't they show him getting his first fast-food-job-paycheck, for less than he used to make in one day at his old job?  I guess he has no worries about his only daughter's possible college plans, eh?  No, nobody with a single teenage child worries about that.  Yeah, right.How so many reviewers can see this as some kind of ""gutsy"" or even ""artsy"" film is beyond me.  It had some promise, and I actually did like some of the insights that the neighbor drug-dealer kid imparted, but there are just too many ""yeah right"" moments otherwise, from beginning to end, to make this worthwhile.  I guess there were not that many good movies in 1999, relatively speaking, if this one got an award for being ""the best."""	2.0	Seemed promising but too many stupid things here	2012-08-20	7	4	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3K1WUNPTECWM5	David Cohen	This movie does an admirable job in describing the dark dysfunction of suburban America.  Each character in the Burnham family is fully developed and Lester's mid life crises is both sad and hilarious.  Annette Benings  portrayal of a driven, materialistic real estate salesperson devoid of soul  is almost tragic.  As a viewer you know that ten minutes into this film  something tragic will happen because the two major characters seem so self  destructive.  The ironic pattern that asserts itself throughout the movie  is that the younger generation has its head screwed on a lot tighter than  the older.  The Burnham daughter and the retentive Marine neighbors son  have a maturity beyond their years, and their wry reflections on their  addled parents is subtley hilarious. &quot;All I wanted was a role  model&quot; muses the daughter.  &quot;Not a jerk that sprays his pants  everytime my friend comes over&quot; This film will be remembered like  &quot;The Graduate&quot; for its controversy in the years to come.	5.0	The truth is never pretty	2000-05-22	5	4	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2OVUDBRWGX0LL	David	"I place ""American Beauty"" on the same pedestal as ""Seinfeld."" I enjoy(ed) both immensely for their entertainment value, yet I cannot help but be disturbed by some the cultural messages that they glorify.Sam Mendes has, indeed, put together an unforgettable movie. You have Kevin Spacey giving the performance of a career as Lester Burnham, a straight-laced company man whose mid-life crisis begins when he meets the Lolita-like friend of his daughter. Mena Suvari is excellent as the aforementioned kittenish Angela--beautiful on the outside but oh-so ugly on the inside. Annette Bening plays Spacey's frustrated wife, a woman who is abhorred by her husband's descent into drugs, fast women, and fast cars, but isn't above getting a little on the side herself (courtesy of a real estate tycoon played by Peter Gallagher).Thora Birch is in the role of Spacey's daughter, Jane, and gives an admirable performance of a teenager yearning for a way out of her dysfunctional family. She finds that exit in the form of Wes Bentley, who plays Ricky Fitts, a quiet teenage boy who moves into the house next door. He also moonlights as a major drug dealer, one client of whom happens to be Jane's father. Bentley's performance is truly superb.Rounding out the major players includes Chris Cooper, as Ricky's father, a Marine Corp colonel with a very, very nasty side to him; and Allison Janney as Ricky's mother, who appears shell-shocked throughout the entire movie--no doubt as the result of physical abuse inflicted upon her by her husband. Both Cooper and Janney deserved to win Oscars.The musical score and cinematography are both outstanding.Despite my reservations over staring at such a sociological train wreck, I highly recommend this movie. DEFINITELY not for underage viewers."	4.0	Fascinating and Disturbing	2004-10-14	3	1	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AKBH21PTTCWVJ	D. Bass	Have we become such a deluded and immoral society that we give the highest amount of praise and approval to a movie such as this? Obviously we have. Is there no longer any feeling of loyalty to one's spouse, and the sanctity  of a sexual relationship in the binding promises of marriage? Again,  apparently not. Our soceity is one which supports movies such as this.  Period. We not only practice the things seen in this movie regularly, but  approve and give praise and WORSHIP to those who carry them out in the  public's eye. Ours in a fallen society, no mistake.This movie is simply  disturbing and grotesque in the most immoral of ways. This film is supposed  to bring forth the hidden evils of the family life in America? Perhaps the  family life of the producer of this film, but certainly not the family life  of people who still hold guidelines and laws in their lives. This is just  one big attempt to make immoral people feel good about themselves; like  their mistakes and sins are perfectly normal behavior for human beings, and  there's no reason to not carry them out. This film is simply one big  &quot;feel-good-about-myself&quot; piece of junk, laced with the most awful  morals and standards conceivable. The thought of killing one's parents is  not something every child is born with; the sexual misrepresentation in  this film is not normal; the apperant lusting in this film is not normal;  most of this film is just a play to try and make the family something it's  not. I can't believe that such a gross and disturbing film has the name  &quot;American&quot; in it; the same word that means liberty, law, and  justice around the world.Is this the kind of substance we want our  children growing up around? Yes, children have, do, and will see this film  many times. A society in which the family unit operates like this cannot  exist, and it's more than obvious to me that this is the direction America  is taking right now. A society that glorifies perversion, unfaithfulness,  murder, ungodliness, and a hand full of other vices is doomed to  extinction. Like it or not, there it is.If this is where America is,  then this film should be renamed &quot;American Dead&quot;.	1.0	&quot;American Dead&quot;: We are a fallen soceity.	2000-05-30	47	18	29

The direction was  gorgeously innovative, the acting was chill-inducing and the writing  could've only been inspired by a muse.  Alan Ball's version of suburbian  crises and life as many live it was thought-provoking and hauntingly  recognizable.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ABN5K7K1TM1QA	Dennis Littrell	"Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is your usual well-behaved 42-year-old dreg of an American dad until he spots his teenaged daughter's girl friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) whose beauty transforms him.  Part of the fun of  this very funny and enjoyable movie is watching Lester break out of his  self-imposed shell and blossom with the rose petals as he tells everybody  what he really thinks as though he had nothing to lose.His daughter Jane  is a brooding raven-haired beauty who likes to put on a white-powdered face  and red Betty Boop lips to go with her full figure.  Thora Birch, who plays  Jane, has a face that can mesmerize, and Director Sam Mendes puts her to  work mesmerizing us.Annette Bening, in a comedic tour de force, plays  Lester's wife Carolyn, a straitlaced, uptight, worry wart who sells real  estate.  Next door we have, just moving in, 18-year-old Ricky Fitts, played  with sly self-assurance by Wes Bentley, the dope-dealing, Bible-suit  wearing, photog son of Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts and his mostly  catatonic wife.  Two houses down there's Jim and Jim, your smiling yuppie  fruit loops and all-around neighborhood sweet guys.  They are however an  embarrassment to Colonel Fitts who is living in the deep, dark corner of a  very large denial closet, paranoid to the teeth that his only son has  inherited the same shameful desires and will act them out.  In an effort to  keep Ricky disciplined and on the straight and narrow, the good Colonel  practices various forms of child abuse ranging from bare-knuckle beatings  to medicated imprisonment.In other words what we have here is your  typical American suburban street.  What makes American Beauty a great  success is a witty script with a deep and beautiful lesson for our age by  Alan Ball, superb direction by Sam Mendes and outstanding performances from  just about everybody in the cast.  Bening is brilliant with her silly  finger gestures and her one foot sideways stance, like a fawn just learning  to walk, and her squinty little eyes full of merriment, and that raised and  then downward pointing index finger of indignant reproof.  (But she really  needs to keep her pretty shins off the bedposts or at least off the wall.)  Mena Suvari is perhaps no more beautiful than any number of other screen  darlings, but she has a litany of sexy expressions and poses that inspire  delight.  Her portrayal of a fast lane teen siren whose talk is bigger than  her experience is just perfect.  She might be a budding star.But more  than anything this is an uplifting and satisfying tale of an unappreciated,  unloved and mostly ignored man who is inspired to transform his life by the  beauty of a girl.  For many people (and for most women, I would wager)  falling in love at first sight with a teenaged girl just because she is  beautiful is shallow and beside the point, inappropriate and not fair.  But  women love men for their power and their strength and their standing in  society.  Is that fair to those men who have none?  Lester's love for  Angela was so great that it transcended carnality, but he didn't know that  until he began to take off her clothes and then he realized something very  beautiful.  He could love her without making love to her.  If he took  advantage of her youth and inexperience, it would cheapen his love for her  and possibly destroy it.  Maybe some people in the audience felt he wasn't  a real man because he stopped, but I tend to feel the opposite.  Not that I  think there is anything wrong with making love to 18-year-old girls (on the  contrary); but if the girl is incapable of experiencing that love, then  perhaps it is better to love her from afar without a sexual expression,  even at the risk of disappointing her, especially if you're old enough to  be her father, and especially if you really do love her.  Notice that in  the next scene she is bored and for her the magic of sexuality is gone.  He  might as well be her father.So much of what we are presented through the  media is a focus on those males who would only be able to express  themselves in some sexually-exploitive manner.  So much of what we read  insists that this is the only way men are.  I'm happy to say that American  Beauty presents another point of view, and presents it beautifully.The  point made by the surprising ending (and the reason for the presence of the  Marine colonel and the two gay guys) is that our contemporary ""enlightened""  society may recognize the legitimacy of homosexual love, but continues to  hypocritically condemn the love of a man for a young girl.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"""	5.0	Middle-aged crazy	2000-05-19	295	190	105

Almost everyone in the class (myself included) was overcome by the &quot;Freudian Syndrome&quot; of believing every neurotic symptom described in the book applied to our lives.  Our teacher cheerfully explained this common phenomenon would occur and only those on the extreme end of the spectrum would be considered truly sick.This movie is one giant Freudian Syndrome.  The characters somehow connect with us because we have experienced their traumas at one point or another in our lives.  I tried not to be cynical, but I found it difficult to sympathize (or empathize) with any of the characters due to the fact that they are all so far &quot;out there&quot;.  Not to mention, many other reviewers have already pointed out the numerous &quot;common sense&quot; problems of who they choose to interact with and the reasons given in the movie as to why each person made the choices they did.  In other words, these people aren't real - they're cartoon characters.This movie was the introductory course (rental material).  If you liked this movie and you want the advanced course, then buy the movie that should have won Best Picture - Magnolia.	2.0	Good, but not &quot;Best Picture&quot; material	2000-12-10	7	2	5

Mena Suvair plays Angela with top notch as a young women who uses seduction for her own purposes but has her own secerets. Sam Mendes makes an amazing film his first time out.

I love how the movie started off funny (funnier for a male I'd imagine) and how the main character changed through the course of the movie. I wish it hasn't ended the way it did... some alternate endings ala Butterfly Effect would have been nice... but the movie flowed well and the character development was well done.It's similar to ""Falling Down"" in a way but not as over the top funny and more emotion and drama and storylines going in different directions. I very much enjoyed it... like a fine wine.. some will like it, some will not. It definitely fit the culture of the late 90's but has aged well enough.The title does fit the film, but you have to watch it all the way through to realize what they mean by the title.... that beauty, like anything, is in the eye of the beholder.Bluray Video Quality was slightly above average, Audio Track DTS-HD and good quality.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8	Desmond Chan	Dysfunctional family ordeals and a sinking American dream of the ideal life has constantly appeared in films like Lee Ang's THE ICE STORM and now  the AMERICAN BEAUTY. The film is one of the most artistically accomplished  - silent and naunced - dissecting each character like peeling the petals of  the rose. Kevin Spacey is unequivocally the scene-stealer with stealthy  emotions - from a deranged husband, a triumph and a tender father - his  expression shows it all. Annette Benning is energized as the money-grubbing  wife Carolyn who is disillusioned by the pursue of money. Voyeurism and  homosexuality is reflected with clear-cutting honesty.The exquisite  thing about the movie is that it holds surprises - and it is not overblown.  It taps into the secret heart of many like Lester in search of his wasted  life back. He sees his daughter's friend (Mena Suvari) as the part of youth  remote from him; the love in Carolyn long lost to the American dream of  riches and glory and his daughter Thora Birch is alienated from him  altogether. The characters are dimensional - each has his story to tell -  the weird neighbour played by Wes Bentley despite his mental history is  ironically the most astute of all. His family is shattered by a disgraced  father and a silenced mother. The tragedy is heartfelt and poignant.Boosted by a haunting score and a screenplay from Alan Ball, Sam Mendes  injects this film with exquisite beauty. It is textured and invites the  audience to look closer into the deep psyche of the characters as well as a  hovering reflection of their own inner hearts. American Beauty evokes  innocence and an understated tone of maturity in the script. Despite all  its harsh ugliness inside, it is indubitably the most savagely tender and  beautiful film in recent times.	5.0	AMERICAN BEAUTY is not skin-deep	2000-08-14	3	2	1

It pretends to be deep and profound, but it is actually shallow and manipulative.  It tires to find quick and easy solutions to people's problems and does not consider the long term conquences.  For example, the main character (Kevin Spacy) quits his professional job to work in a fast-food resturant.  At first he may enjoy it, but how long could he sustain that lifestyle.  How long could he be happy working minimum wage.  Also, his daughter is ready to run away with her drug-dealer boyfriend.  How long do you think such a relationship could last?  The movie does not consider these consequences.  Think about the characters' actions and apply them to real life and you will realize 'American Beauty' is full of crap.	2.0	Just Complete Rubbish.	2001-03-19	4	2	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2T1IF7N85NV1X	D. Hodgson	*Disclaimer: I am terrible at writing reviews. Perhaps if I wrote them more often I'd be better.American Beauty is not the &#34;Greatest Movie of All-Time!&#34;, but a fine film absolutely worthy of your undivided attention and multiple views. I realize this film received massive accolades when it was released in 1999, deservingly so. However when a film earns a Best Picture Oscar, it puts a lot of pressure on it to be something utterly mind-blowing. I don't think this film achieved that. But it was definitely awareness-expanding...I was introduced to the movie by a classmate when I was a senior in High School (about 11 years ago now). At 18 I was immediately drawn to it. As soon as the movie started I felt this almost immediate curiosity and assurance that I was in for something spectacular, engaging and different. I wasn't disappointed. The only disappointment for me, might be the ending. And even though it's probably for the most part &#34;common knowledge&#34; at this point for most people on how it ends, I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. I wasn't disappointed with the ending because I thought it was a &#34;bad ending&#34;. It was more, &#34;I wish things had turned out different&#34; for the primary character of the story. I wouldn't really use the word protagonist. The movie doesn't really contain a standard setting for that element. It's a movie about real types of people, who generally exist within a grey area of morality. No one is completely good or bad. Everyone is portrayed as flawed human beings.Most of the acting was pretty impeccable. Kevin Spacey was particularly noteworthy, but everyone held their weight for sure.It also does a great job of mixing dark comedy with more serious emotions.I don't know really what else to say. 11 years later, naturally I view the movie a little differently, as is the case with any piece of art and the passing of time.Look Closer.	3.0	3 and 1/2 Stars	2014-01-30	1	0	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1G56KHOUOFWDW	"Dianne Foster ""Di"""	I'm going to buy the DVD version of this film which I saw on the big screen. Kevin Spacey deserved his Oscar (for this and other films). There are incredible moments in this film...such as the one where Annette Benning  falls on her dead husband's suits in an agony of grief; and beautiful  haunting shots like the plastic bag blowing in the wind. Annette Benning  and Peter Gallagher are very fine actors and both gave outstanding  performances.My ex-husband's wife looks like Annette Benning and she  sold real estate for awhile. My friend's wife sold real estate and she had  an affair with a builder..in one of the houses under construction at the  time. My neighbor worked for the CIA.  His kid was &quot;the&quot; drug  dealer on our block. We have a relative who died from a drug overdose. One  of our neighbors shot another neighbor because he was messing around with  his wife. I left my ex-husband who was a Marine because he insisted on  keeping loaded guns in the house. Gee this film sure captures life in a  middle-class neighborhood in America.	5.0	Sadly, a realistic  film.	2000-05-27	5	4	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A191FN0R6069WX	Dino	I didn't quite know what to expect before viewing American Beauty. Having seen a trailer for the film, I expected it to concentrate heavily on the character of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). I suppose it does - Spacey, one of cinema's great actors, dominates the film. The relationships between the other main characters both add and detract from the success of the film. Particularly strong performances from Burnham's neighbours (British spelling!) - the ultimate disfunctional family headed by Colonel Frank Fitts US Marine Corps (as Chris Cooper regularly introduces himself), father to drug dealing son Ricky (Wes Bentley) and husband of sorts to depressed Barbara (Allison Janney). The Colonel despises gays, owns an original piece of Nazi cutlery and takes every opportunity to express his dominance. His son secretely videos the Burnham family home, especially Lester Burnham's teenage daughter Jane (Thora Burch). The pair eventually meet and gradually fall in love. I use the word gradually deliberately. Their relationship is one of the film's weaker points. Their subplot is ponderous and could have been dropped altogether without harming the film.  Meanwhile, Spacey's character transforms himself from a subserviant, meek door mouse, dominated by his extravert wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), into a carefree devil-may-care guy who quits his job, sells his sensible family car to buy a cool classic, the car of his dreams. The catalyst of this transformation is his daughter's friend Angela Hayes (Mena Survari), who he meets and immedialtely lusts over. When she returns his affection, Lester begins working out, turning his garage into a private gym, until he realises that they can never consumate their relationship.  American Beauty is a fun ride, mainly thanks to the charismatic Spacey. Lester Burnham does what many people would love to do - trade security for freedom before it's too late. It's not a perfect film and was perhaps fortunate to win so many Oscars, but it's well worth watching and includes another great Kevin Spacey performance.	4.0	Unconventional Oscar winner	2001-08-14	5	2	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AFW5HVXZDJZCB	Dixie &#34;45&#34;	This was a great movie that I saw years ago, and I'm still intrigued by it today.  So much so that I had to get the dvd, so I could watch it again.  It has some fascinating twist's and turn's in the story, and keep's you on the edge of your seat.  Kevin Spacey get's into the feel of his character and Annette Bening is terrific as his Wife, and they are so awesome together. Their Daughter, her best friend and the Father and Son next door neighbor's put on a fabulous performance too.  It's funny, sad, disturbing, surprising and has quite a tragic ending.  It's like a roller coaster ride that keep's on going and going non stop.  It might not be a movie that will appeal to everyone, but if you're looking for a great movie that's a little different than the ordinary, check this one out.  I would definitely recommend it.

Johnson	This movie came up in conversation today and I remembered I had bought it because I really like Kevin Spacey and because it won Oscar for Best Picture. So I watched it and am really weirded out. This is a 1999 movie and when it was made, I would have been exactly Kevin Spacey's character's age. Having undergone one myself, I totally understand his midlife crisis and somehow, even his solution. The Burnhams are very real due to the acting talents of Spacey and Bening; however, the movie is unreal. Or is it the other way around? There are so many inter-connections and twists and turns, yet it's predictable at the same time. At least there are only 6 major characters to deal with: two married couples and two teens, the couples' children, no less.I'm giving this 3 stars because it's close, on the positive side, to 2 and 1/2 stars: totally midpoint since I am so muddled and ambivalent about this movie.	3.0	"""Huh?"""	2009-07-18	4	0	4

If you're looking for great DVD picture quality, however, you'd best stay away from this one.The encoding job is horrible, and glitches pop up all over the place.  Note the flickering mini-blinds in the for-sale house, jerkily-moving backgrounds during various pans, mirage-like effects on supposedly straight lines.  If you're a purist and care about picture quality, you should wait until they distribute a better version.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	Hollywood has always gone out of the way to portray life in the big city, or on the countryside, but the suburban lifestyle remained to be explored in greater detail. &quot;American Beauty,&quot; a script written by Alan Ball, would become the most praised film of 1999, exploring the ups and downs of suburbia through the eyes of one man. As boasted in the movie trailers, &quot;American Beauty&quot; proves that a comedy can be serious, and a drama can be humorous.The film contains a large cargo of controversial issues, from drug use and dysfunctional families to homosexuality and sexual relationships that span two different age groups. In a time period where so many people are too timid to discuss these issues it is refreshing to see that a movie which is widely available to the general public is carrying all of these issues among its lines of dialogue and sweeping camera shots. Director Sam Mendes keeps the movie going at its own unique pace, bringing the characters to life with a top-notch cast and a superb crew.Kevin Spacey is the ever-drab Lester Burnham, a typical suburban male who leads a monotonous, routine lifestyle with his domineering, real-estate wife Carolyn, and his emotionally-distanced daughter Jane. A typical day at work and a family dinner are among the many aspects of life shown through Lester's eyes. When Carolyn and Lester attend Jane's cheerleading performance at a school basketball game, Lester is suddenly thrown into a world of sexual fantasy when he lays eyes on his daughter's friend, Angela Hayes. This begins his descent/ascent, and is soon working out to build up his body for his new love and smoking joints he gets from his teenage next door neighbor. He quits his job, blackmails his old boss, and begins working as a short-order cook at a fast-food restaurant.This is perhaps one of the most controversial films ever. But, it is also one of the most hauntingly realistic and powerful movies that has ever moved audiences to feel such emotion for life and connection to the characters it portrays. Each scene has its own way of making us believe in the emotions that Lester is experiencing, and very soon, we are in his world, going through the life that he is living, sometimes laughing, sometimes crying, and sometimes bewildered by his actions. To be able to feel that deep a connection is the mark of a truly great film.Kevin Spacey makes the most unbelievable character in history, bringing such hilarity and laughter to the screen, while at the same time making sure the audience knows that his character is being totally serious and sincere in his actions, and not doing it for mere attention. Annette Bening is wonderful in her role as Carolyn, who is the strong yet very fragile wife of Lester. She has a wonderful knack for showing her emotion, whether it be happy or sad, at all times of filming. The teenage actors, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley, are superbly rendered here, making the teenage aspect of the story realistic and memorable.The film has a great deal to offer for all age groups who watch it. It deals with real-life issues in a reality-based setting, with characters who can easily parallel people in real life. It is no wonder that the film received the awards it did; it is a truly remarkable masterpiece that will be remembered by all for years to come.	5.0	Beauty in every way, shape and form.	2001-03-30	24	16	8

Mok	By the end of American Beauty, I knew that in whatever evaluations I might  articulate about the film, this was one case where I can't pretend to have  any kind of objectivity.The emotional impact of this film on me was so  great that I felt personally affected, a rarity when I watch a film these  days.  No character of any weight is neglected in this film, each with a  carefully considered arc and deep-welled needs and desires that make you  care.  Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham brings to life the complex  psychosexual dilemmas of the character effortlessly, with his trademark  offbeat charisma and wit; Wes Bentley, with his penetrating stare and  sensitive characterization, brings a tenderness and nuance to the  oddball-kid-next-door role of Ricky Fitts; Thora Birch projects deep  maturity as Jane, clarifying every internal change her character goes  through as she starts becoming drawn to Ricky to leave her family behind;  Mena Suvari joins the ranks of Katie Holmes and Sarah Polley as a young  actress to watch for, injecting remarkably depth and absolute honesty to  the role of Angela; even an antagonist like Col. Fitts is filled by an  excellent portrayal in Chris Cooper's performance, a wrenching mix of  hardened hatreds and shattering vulnerability.  The only character that was  questionable to me was Annette Bening's, where I actually feel like  Carolyn's private moments (where we're supposed to be able to poke through  her mask) are also not believable.  However, given so many other moving  moments, points of delicious humour, and visually gorgeous cinematography,  I didn't really care.  And aesthetically this is a feast for the senses:  Conrad L. Hall's acclaimed cinematography both makes the actors and scenery  look good and help probe into the life within them, and Thomas Newman's  score is perfect, as light-fingered as director Sam Mendes' staging and  tone, as delicate as the performances, as witty and suggestive as Alan  Ball's multi-layered, richly evocative script, and as beautiful as the  visuals.This film soared to the top of my best-of lists right after I  saw it, ranking alongside diverse favourites I've seen over the years  including GoodFellas, The Killer, Manon of the Spring, Fun, and Kagemusha:  The Shadow Warrior.  American Beauty is every bit their equal in terms of  visual sophistication, performances and craft, while surpassing them all in  its quest for emotional catharsis and engagement.	5.0	Emotionally sublime, flawless filmmaking and acting.	2000-06-01	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2FWZ58M6IQMD7	Doc Stew	This film breaks all barriers as we know it in the movie industry. It portrays innovative concepts that up until now, most producers have been afraid to make because of the possible knee-jerk reaction the public might have to it. It's true that this movie is not for everyone because it is new and controverial. But if you keep an open mind, you will thoroughly be entertained. Kevin Spacey gives a performance like none other and makes you wish he was your next door neighbor. This film is filled with great metaphors and visual beauty which makes for a great DVD to own to watch over and over again. The special features are amazing, which is worth the price alone.

The supposed 'psycho' son is all sensitive and sentimental, and his father shows genuine concern and care for him despite regularly beating him up hard.The main family's daughter sets up to have her father killed simply because she isn't proud of him which is a weird motif, and gets her ""psycho"" boyfriend to agree to do it, but wait, it's actually his abusive father that pulls the trigger because he thinks he's gay?  So out of the blue they decided the dad should pull the trigger because he's homophobic, meaning two people want to kill a father for not being a good father and 'possibly' gay.A sentimental and sensitive psycho who's also a drug dealer. A flirtatious virgin, an emphatic abuser, not sure how a supposedly great movie doesn't even get basic personality traits right,  these make no sense even by comicbook standards.The sentimental 'psycho' neighbor son then  rebuts his fathers attack (as in a 'the final revenge', which seems to confuse the film's message unless it  wants to tell 10 messages including about homophobia, marriage woes, about standing one's ground, etc) and move out after the last  beating by the father, and does so immediately in the middle of the night, and his mom doesn't even ask what happened on his way out but casually 'understands', and out he moves, as if they put no consideration into the magnitude of events at all.The homophobic military dad then breaks down to his neighbor (kevin spacey) which he later kills because he hates gays even though he just came out to him as gay, that's a conflict that makes no sense. He has to be either 100% machismo or 100% soft (breaks down, tries to kiss a man), nothing in between? IT's as if a baby put together the characters - ""hey, we must show the audience that this guy is a closet gay, so why not have him try and KISS his male neighbor"", duh, very sophisticated for such a 'crop of the cream' film..The lead character dad  has to be dead with a bullet hole in his scull before the wife is 'allowed' to show some caring feeling for him at all?  Way to evoke 'thought', bluntly.  All these 'shock' scenes are padded with excessively long,  mind numbing 'trips' of sentimental drivel with music, aka fluff, where the 'psycho' son gets exceedingly sentimental, talking about outright love and beauty, making the film very pretentious.The film may be decent entertainment but is no a 'great movie', because it's full of logical holes that can't be blamed on genre.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2CVNX4OICQQ7X	Doug Martin	The movie will easily be considered one of the best, if not the best movie ever, in a few years.  There is nothing to complain about with this movie as the direction was fabulous. The multiple storylines combine seemlessly  and is greatly wrapped up at the end. Just when you think you know what  will happen next...It does, but not exactly as you thought.The movie  never dissapoints, teen angst, midage crisis, unhappy wife. What does this  movie not have? A great snapshot of our new society.	5.0	The number one movie EVER	2000-05-11	3	0	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AJ61JBUA1YVLB	Drazen J.	I found this movie painfully real, and that's what makes it so good.  However, without Spacey and Beninng, the movie would probably be worse. We have to realize that there is more to the movie than a story - actors, director, screenplay writer, etc. When you're judging a movie, you judge all of that. I find everything in the movie phenomenal, and that's what earns it a five-star rating. There are plenty of movies out there that didn't make it just because they didn't have good actors. Do you think &quot;Casablanca&quot; would have been such a masterpiece if they went with a first choice for main actor(Ronald Reagan), who refused the role? I am not clear why would people who find this movie &quot;disturbing&quot; give it a one star rating only? Just because you a) pretend to not understand something; or b) understand, but choose to ignore something, doesn't make that bad ...	5.0	Disturbing because it's real?	2001-02-26	5	1	4

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A35YWA2V4QHOJ3	"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12"""	If this movie is to be labeled as an &quot;experimental movie,&quot; then it is a successful experiment.  When I first saw it in the theatre, I had no idea what to expect.  To my surprise and delight, I found a truly deep and stimulating film;  something that is almost bereft in Hollywood productions these days.The movie centers around the life of one Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey.  This is a different sort of role for the usual masculine Spacey, and he turns in an Academy Award calibre performance.  The story details the plight of Burnham as he approaches middle age and the dreaded &quot;mid-life crisis.&quot;  His marriage no longer holds any passion, his daughter feels nothing but apathy towards him, and his employer feels that he must write up a report to &quot;justify his existence&quot; as the company he works for is ready to downsize (if that's not a buzzword these days for corporations, I don't know what is).There is a haunting nostalgia and foreboding which saturates this movie as few I've ever seen.  Burnham's meditation on his own death is utterly fascinating.  The tale distinctively brings to mind the passage &quot;Death By Water&quot; from T.S. Eliot's &quot;The Wasteland&quot;:Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell And the profit and loss.A current under seaPicked his bones in whispers.  As he rose and fellHe passed the stages of his age and youthEntering the whirlpool.Gentile or JewO you who turn the wheel and look to windward,Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall asyou.  (312-322)Through all this, Spacey's character dreams of reclaiming lost youth &amp; the vigour for life that he once held.  There are also Faulkneresque overtones straight out of &quot;The Sound And The Fury&quot; as Burnham's daughter &amp; her boyfriend confront the awakening of their sexuality and the concept of death simultaneously.This is a tremendous effort of film-making, and I just wish Hollywood would take more chances on cerebral projects such as this one, instead of sticking to the safe, redundant &quot;tried &amp; true&quot; formulae movies for which they are so well known.  Whether my wish comes true or not (it probably won't), this is a fantastic post-modern film to be enjoyed by all.	5.0	A definitive post-modern flick	2001-04-22	9	6	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A5WN8L3I2CDV5	D. Rotmil	"It's one thing to not like a film such as ""American Beauty"" because you enjoy more car chases and more explosions. It's quite another to deem a film as a pile of poo when clouded by one's own personal views of ""morality"". It tends to blind sight a film viewer from understanding the actual ""moral"" of the story.  Despite some glaringly misguided and erroneous perceptions of ""American Beauty"" by some on this site, this film is a masterpiece in performance, cinematography and screenwriting.  The storyline has been well documented here, so I will delve into other concepts this film.  (Warning: Spoilers)Lester Burnham said that he ""felt like he was in a coma for the last 20 years and just woke up"" after laying eyes on the luscious Angela Hayes.  In fact, he awoke into another dream, dwelling in fantasies, reliving a rebellious youth, quitting his job, smoking joints and pumping iron as his fantasies of the rose pedaled Angela drives him. (And don't count out the meaning of those roses - they turn up everywhere).  When he faces the realization of his fantasy by starting his seduction, he discovers that the dirty, naughty Angela is a frightened child, no different than his own Jane.  He has now - finally - awoken from that coma.  Just as he begins to conceive his blessings, tragedy steals them from him.  In death, he sees the truth in his life:  his lovely daughter Jane, his wonderful house and the memory of his carefree, happy wife laughing on an amusement park ride. In two gunshots Lester drifts in an afterlife limbo - viewing the world in which he once lived as the most sensuous, beauty he ever set eyes on.  Just like Ricky Fitts (the only character who relished beauty in the world with a poetic longing) sees it in a plastic bag, dancing with the wind.""American Beauty"" is not a film about homosexuality.  It is not a movie about morals. It is not a film about stereotyping military men, nor is it about pedophilia. This film is a look into the concept of the American Dream, and how it might not be what it seems. We fall into ruts. We have mid-life crises. Husbands and wives move in other directions and find contempt for each other. Teenagers can be moody and hate their parents, because 1) they are too self absorbed to notice them, or 2) they don't know how to communicate with them. People step out of bounds to move up in a career. Beauty queens are hiding more innocence than one would suspect. Some others live in a hypocritical world, hiding what they are, staying tightly wound, perceiving others to be what they are not, and spewing hatred over things that aren't true. In a nutshell, everyone in this movie is trying to be something they are not.  In doing so, they are missing out on the blessings on what they already have, and the humans they are meant to be.What stuck me most about ""American Beauty"" is not only the story we're experiencing on screen, but the story we won't see:  the aftermath of Lester Burnham's demise.  Who will be blamed for Lester's death?  Will Carolyn?  Ricky? Jane? Frank Fitts? What about Carolyn and the devastation over the loss of the husband whom she let slip through her fingers in moments of anger, neglect and put downs?  What wreckage will be left in this family?  How will they live with the memory of having given such careless thought to the life they once had and will never have again?The Oscars this film has garnered speaks for itself.  So, before one gripes about homosexual stereotypes and morality in this film, think about what you are not seeing. Put aside your political agenda, and look beyond what you find ugly or wrong and render the universal meaning of this film.  The unsavory facets of a story are devices to make you THINK - no matter how offensive. That's what storytelling and film are about.  Much like Captain Frank Fitts, you might dwell in misconceived notions that veer off the path of truth, thus missing out on the beauty of the story entirely.  If you don't like it, Disney films are a good alternative."	5.0	Everything Is Not What it Seems	2005-01-07	22	18	4
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AWXTLFKK65D5P	DrPeriut@aol.com	This movie is simply about the reality of life. Just as Shakespeare was able to use the human character and write many great works, so do the authors of this film. It simply is about our lives, our very deep secrets, our deepest dreams, and finally, about somebody shaking us, so we can face it. Unfortunately, life is sometimes hard to accept. But the main theme of the film is that &quot;there is awesome beauty everywhere&quot;.The acting was also superb!	5.0	Reality.	2001-02-10	4	2	2

Tucker ""mrt77"""	Though I still feel Fight Club was the beter film, I will tell you, of the nominated films, American Beauty deserved to win.I think this is one of most profound film in ages. Yes, it is very funny in spots, and it is a  parody of the American family, but it also features a beautiful, human  story at the end. Something that you don't see everyday in your average  comedy/parody film.The drama was perfectly balanced as well, so it never  really seems too much of either a comedy or a drama.Many people have  likened this film to Happiness, even saying Happiness was better and more  profound. I fail to see how that is. And unlike Happiness, the actors in  this film actually know how to act.Be sure to see this more than once.  You'll catch a lot of things you missed your first time through.	5.0	Second best film of '99	2000-06-14	3	2	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A340NZIFOW3JXP	DURGAZ	Sorry to say, but only the squares would find anything deep or revelatory in this movie, and that is a lot of you reading this, you poor, pasteurized processed cheese products of human beings. You people haven't already realised all the messages in this film by yourselves? Well, maybe something good will come of this film, for that.This is basically an exploitation film done in A movie production style. In my opinion, the only merit this film has is that the pot-using boyfriend with the camera was not portrayed as an unintelligent lazy slacker. Everything else was completely laughable and ridiculous. The event that stands out in my mind is when the camera guy's military-dad is standing in his yard and watching as Kevin Spacey signals, in plain view, for camera guy to call him so they can meet for another financial transaction - Oh COME ON!The fact that American Beauty (title of a Greatful Dead album) was so widely praised and acknowledged in the way that it was by so many people both terrifies me and gives me hope.

There is no ""LOL FUNNY WITTY"" or ""DARK HUMOR LOL!"" as people would have you believe. I get sick of people's intelligence being insulted because they don't like this trashy excuse of a movie. It takes the worst aspects of an average, ordinary life, heavily exagerates them, and shoves them down your throat. And when it's not finding ways to show your teenage girls' breasts for no apparent reason, it's trying to subconciously implant stupid stereotypes like that armed forces veterans are homophobic psycopaths, or that middle aged white women are whores (well that may be true from my experience, but never the less!)This movie does not entertain or enlighten, it only takes the things we wish to escape from in our lives and forces them into one of our only place of refuge, the cinema.People you do not have to like this movie just because people who claim to have a high IQ think it's 'witty' and 'inspirational'- Trust your own opinion and realize that this is trash and don't let them force this kind of 'enterntainment' on us again :("	1.0	We watch movies to get away from this kind of stuff	2003-01-28	47	11	36
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2SO6CK9G8OJCM	"Dylan Patrick Smith ""recording musician"""	The first time I saw this film I was left thinking, &quot;...is this what the Academy considers for a Best Picture?  It seems a bit odd for  considering a Best Picture nomination.&quot;  But then as the days went on  I couldn't get the images and music from the movie out of my head.  I must  admit, I am a Kevin Spacey fan ever since &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;  and to see my favorite actor once again I knew it had to be good.  It  wasn't until the second time I saw the movie that it hit me like a freight  train....this is my most favorite movie of all time.  Everything is  perfect.  Even the surreal rose-petal sequences are a visual treat.The  cast was given a razor sharp script to follow and each actor performed  perfectly.  Thomas Newman's haunting score was very intriguing.  It think  the ultimate scene that touched me was when Ricky (Wes Bentley) showed the  simplicity of a paper bag being blown around by the wind to his girlfriend  Jane (Thora Birch).  The sheer magnitude of his finding beauty in something  like that is why I love this film so much.  The movie has a perfect blend  of superior acting and cinematography.A brilliant job to Sam Mendes,  the entire cast, and to the Academy for giving this film every Oscar that  it deserved.	5.0	5 stars is not enough for this masterpiece!	2000-08-01	34	29	5

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AMA9QL8HT8GS3	"""eastercrow"""	This flick is a string of tired ol' images and characters. The plot is worn out; every concept is borrowed and boring. Everything about this flick is a cliche. On the surface. I think that was by design. Oooh that's scary. You can't say one bad thing about the performances, the script, the cinematography or the score. And if you can, well... I don't wanna talk to you anymore -- you're obviously WAY too smart for me. (ah-hem) This is one of those movies that will surprize you if you let it. After purchasing this version and viewing it, I felt like it'd let me down... but then, discussing it a few days later, I realized there was still more that I got out of it (I saw it on the big screen three times, and this was the fourth overall.) I'm still convinced that some stuff coulda been left off, but I'm willing to give it a chance next time around. So what about the second tape? This version has additional footage: it has trailers for other movies (I love that, it reminds you of what all came out at the same time), it has the awards reel (I think they call it the awards reel) what the studio sends to the awards shows' voters, I guess, with all of the critics' blah, blah, blah and a little &quot;making of&quot; action... it's OK. The rest of the second tape is Conrad Hall and what's-his-name-the-director going over the storyboards. At first, it was like zzzzzzzzzzzz, but it's OK too, if you're into that sort of thing -- y'know, the sort of thing that's in the DVD, but no-one every really watches. No-one really watches, but when they find out you don't have a DVD player, they tell you about like you're missing out or something.	4.0	Masterful use of the cliche	2001-09-19	1	0	1

The character interaction between the Burnham family is spectacular.  The entire cast is absolutly wonderful.Kevin Spacey did what all people wish they could do. . . Take back their life and reclaim their youth from the soul-sucking monotony that is everyday suberbia, and a lousy job. Trade in the Camry for a '69 Camaro, it'll save your soul.Ditracters of this film only dislike it because their lives are too much like it. They realize that they are stuck in a job and life that they do not want and see themselves unable to do what Spacey does in the film. This movie makes you want to live life in the moment, I cannot think of any other movie that has that kind of effect.	5.0	If I could give it more stars . . I would	2002-10-11	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AQIRBENYADT43	Eddy	"""Most men lead lives of quiet desperation"". This famous Henry David Thoreau quote is often cited but nowhere is it more apt than in the life of Lester Burnham. The life of dreary feigned cheerfulness that he lives in suburban America bores him to tears, but that is all blown out of his mind by the arrival of the young pretty nymphet Angela Hayes.With clear parallels to Vladimir Nabokov's 'Lolita' this movie is as much a feast for the mind as it is a cinematographic feast for the eye. The red rose petals bursting forth so often being a striking representation of the rebirth of Lester's life after so many years in monotonous solitude and also of the budding beauty of youth that Angela makes her own.What makes 'American Beauty' so encapsulating is the anger that is always on the verge of bursting out of the characters. Lester is stepped on and belittled by his family which fuels a fury that is boiling beneath his calm exterior. Angela is a release for Lester, both from the mind numbing boredom he suffers, and the sexual frustration that his wife forces on him. Make no mistake it is not love or anything like it that pulls him towards her, it is nothing but a combination of boredom and pure animal lust.'American Beauty' is a remarkable film that has left it's mark on the cinema world and beyond. It's dark depiction of middle class suburbia has spawned a line of similar creations such as 'The Stepford Wives' and T.V. show 'Desperate Housewives'. But no matter how many movies or T.V. shows come in it's wake, it is doubtful that any of them will match the dark, bizzare fascinating nature of this classic."	5.0	"""You have no idea what I'm talking about I'm sure, but don't worry, you will someday"""	2005-09-24	7	6	1

The other characters showed family values of family friction and family violence which heteros cutely call &quot;domestic&quot; violence to avoid associating their sacred &quot;family&quot; with violence.  Heteros should concentrate or being nice to other heteros and being tolerate of those not born hetero.  FAMILY VIOLENCE is not a boon.	5.0	American Beauty	2000-10-20	2	0	2

It presents a number of dramatic subplots and eccentric characters that all add up to nothing.  The love story is what kills the film because the kid with the camera, whatever his name is, is so  boring and pretentious it almost made me sick to watch him act.  I realize this is an unintelligent review, but I think it is only appropriate that a review for this overblown piece of trash should be unintelligent.  Okay so the kid loves his father who is a racist, violent loser, and the kid loves a girl and ignores all other girls, and he is perfect, and he knows everything.  They should have called this movie &quot;Jesus Christ in Suburbia&quot;.  Middle  aged men will love the character of Kevin Spacey though and his pathetic attempts to break through the monotony of his life.  Hint:  Buying a car, exercising to improve looks, and not working...oh, and smoking marijuana...yeah, he's really correcting things by becoming more materialistic and more selfish.  Some people can afford to be heartless and greedy I guess.	1.0	American Trash and Selfish Bliss	2000-09-30	17	4	13

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AQ3D929JU7DJO	E. Ernst	"The American dream:  a nuclear family living in a nice house with a white, picket fence and a pretty garden; financial prosperity achieved through hard work.  It's a truly beautiful thing.  However, opposite to what the title implies, ""American Beauty,"" written by Alan Ball and under direction of Sam Mendes, illustrates a dysfunctional family full of depression and hypocrisy all the while circling about a beauty that is not widely realized-a certain hidden beauty seemingly uncovered by a grocery bag fluttering in the wind.  The beauty contained in the film isn't so much of an ""American Dream"" beauty or a ""Cosmopolitan"" beauty, but a deeper, heroic beauty.  This masterpiece shows that even people that make questionable decisions in life can still be heroes because of their self-achievements.""American Beauty"" is written as a narrative predominantly through the eyes of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a 40-something father of one struggling to raise himself from his rather dead life.  His obstacles on this expedition are his wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), an overbearing, superficial realtor, his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) who claims to hate him, and his telemarketing job.  Lester falls in love with Jane's best friend, quits his job, and smokes marijuana with Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) who lives next door, all of which make him freed of all responsibility and care in the world.  Lester becomes a relaxed man.  A certain reviewer, brings up the opinion that Lester, or anyone else for that matter, cannot be considered a hero.  Even though ""he's working out, blackmails his boss, smokes pot and does whatever he wants,"" he does learn about how life is so entirely sacred no matter what.  To me, that makes him a hero.  So many people walk around in their lifeless bodies being depressed and not having any hope.  Lester shows life that he's going to be in control no matter what.  Kevin Spacey is quite possibly the only actor capable of playing Lester to such precision and making him so likable, and admirable even if he does make a number of poor decisions.  As another review states, Lester is ""an unappreciated, unloved, and mostly ignored man who is inspired to transform his life by the beauty of a girl.""This movie shines most with Lester's relationships with youth in comparison to his own age.  He discovers that the younger people tend to have clearer mindsets and haven't been affected by the same torment that he has experienced.  Lester found it hard to see any point to life before quitting his job but when he did, he was able to view the world differently and do thinks he wouldn't have thought possible earlier.  He is a dream-seeker which Kevin Spacey too wonderfully portrayed.  Those who strive to achieve their dreams are heroes in my opinion.  Spacey isn't the only outstanding actor in this movie, however.  Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, and Wes Bentley also shine in the film.  But if there is one negative aspect of the film, it's Carolyn's character.  Annette Bening does a great job with what she is given, but Carolyn is a nearly impossible person.  She is so animated that one might expect her in a cartoon soap opera.  This isn't necessarily Annette Bening's fault, but it bothered me throughout.  Though she seemed like a fake character, Carolyn was desperate to see beauty in the world, too.  She sought this beauty by looking towards Buddy Kane and following his example, though never really achieving her dreams.""American Beauty"" is a great movie in that even throughout the beatings and the arguments and the adultery and all other negative aspects of this suburban life, each character learns grand lessons of life and through the writing, directing, and acting, it's heroic, heartwarming, and heartbreaking at the same time."	5.0	Heroic American Beauty	2006-04-04	0	0	0

I've watched this I don't know how many times (but I don't watch the ending any more).  However, if  you are the old-fashioned catholic type, I would not watch it.  My husband's parents are that type, and because of how much we loved the movie we wanted to share it with them and watch it with them. Just a half hour or so into the movie, they got up to leave. They were so disturbed, they would not even stay to visit with the movie off. For them, the stuff going on between the teenager and Kevin Spacey was disturbing and disgusting.

If you are a not so average american joe, and you are going through a midlife crisis, you will probably appreciate this movie alot.  Spacey, in  the role of Lester, is totally amazing.  I think that he is one of the  amazing actors of all time.  He brings Lester to life so vividly, and he  speaks his lines so perfectly. Speaking of perfect, here's a slice of  america that will have some people running for the door.  I saw a few  squirming in their seats in the theater.  I think you need to sort of have  a dark sense of humor, and appreciate films of all genres to really see all  the beauty of this movie. You really have to do some searching in yourself  and in this film to feel it's true meaning.  It was filmed so beautifully,  and made me think of paper bags floating through the air in a whole new  way.The Script -- Amazing!  I truly have to commend the script  writer for turning out what is probably one of the best.  almost as good as  Pulp Fiction, which i found to be the best script ever.  There are some  really funny lines in this film, and i am glad that Kevin Spacey gets a  few.  He sells those lines so well.The actors --  This is acting at it's  finest, from Spacey, to Benning, to even the repressed Marine living next  door.  Everyone in this film really gave awesome performances. Hands down,  Kevin Spacey is the best.  If you are a huge fan of his work, you will love  this movie.  and if you want to see something different, something truly  unique and original -- SEE AMERICAN BEAUTY.

The fact that it is so enormously popular speaks to the quiet desperation many of us sometimes feel in our mundane, humdrum lives...where most of your time is spent doing stuff you are obligated to do, not what you really want to do.From the exterior, Kevin Spacey's character has a good job, a great house, a beautiful wife and a loving daughter.  The fact is, he's miserable. I love how he is sick of keeping up appearances.  I love how he decides to live life the way he wants to - telling his boss to buzz off, buying his dream car, working out and smoking pot - it's brilliant.  If a lot of people were brave enough, they would probably admit that they might like to go on a similar adventure.In short, the way the tale unfolds is sheer brilliance.  The end is shocking and surprising, and very powerful.  This is mandatory movie watching for any film buff.	5.0	Love it!	2008-03-11	6	5	1

Kevin Spacey's performance was outstanding as was the performance  of Annete Benning and the rest of his co-stars.  The twists in the plot  and true fellings people have are shown dramatically and perfectly.  The  insight and true genius is only surpassed by the true accuracy of the  movie.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A39U1VDCW3WZ55	Emily Heinegg	"American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes, is a brilliant film that invites us to ""look closer"" and examine the ideals of beauty. Jane Burnham and Angela Hayes are best friends who are on the cheerleading squad together. Jane is the ""ugly,"" dark-haired gray-eyed sidekick to Angela, the blond-haired blue-eyed ""beauty."" Beauty is put under the lens when Ricky Fitts, Jane's neighbor, films Jane with his personal video recorder from his window. Angela embodies the stereotypical ""perfect"" female, so Jane isn't the typical object of affection and questions Ricky's feelings for her. Ricky shows the viewer through his eyes, his definition of beauty. There is not a single definition of beauty. It is our horizon of experience that shapes our ideals.Caroline Burnham is the obsessive compulsive, whiny, housewife. She is the super female who works as a realtor and top dog in the matriarchal family driving the car and making the money. By contrast, the Fitts are the patriarchal, militant family under the command of Colonel Frank Fitts, who is abusive to his son Ricky. Their neighbors, the Jims, are a (...)couple living together. They have a very healthy relationship and respect each other and see each other as equals.  Fascinating, how the most controversial relationship in society is the best functioning family of the three in the film."	5.0	Grrrls and Cinema Movie Review	2004-05-11	0	0	0

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AW2BZYHG2MGSN	Emmanuel Goldstein	American Beauty is one of those movies that you have to see to understand it. Box office reviews and web commentaries barely touch on its amazing genius. The film has a largely visual storyline, so that makes it hard for people who don't process visual information very well or aren't sight-sensitive. Much is information communicated over these subtle details. Thus, those of us who are used to thinking analytically when watching films will know how to appreciate it, while those who simply want to rent this video and watch over popcorn will certainly feel disappointed.I don't want to reveal too much of the storyline, but I will say that a core theme of the film is exploring what lurks behind the sugary image of middle-class, white suburbia and how appearances often contradict reality in astonishing ways. As someone who trained in philosophy while in undergrad, I would say that the film certainly has a steady nihilistic undercurrent that comes with post-modern existentialist themes. It's depressing, but depressing in a way that makes you come alive. It speaks the bitter truth by telling us each of the characters' lies. Even the title of the film evokes a sort of sweet, twisted irony.Those who have longed for the 'Leave it to Beaver' or 'Father Knows Best' type of life will find this film revolting, but those who identify with 'The Simpsons' as being closer to reality will give it two thumbs up. American Beauty will definitely strike a sharp chord in a large audience, but I still say that only film buffs and those used to abstract-thinking will enjoy it. To those who simply want a shifty, action-filled plot, the movie might at first (unfairly) seem a bit boring.	4.0	A Mind-Shattering Film, But Only Film Buffs Will Truly Appreciate It	2007-09-23	5	3	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A228NBNLYJ8V3J	Eran Cohen	Taken seriously, this film is very bothering.It's main aim is to criticize ,in an arresting ,extraordinary way ,the life story of the middle class in nowadays american society.After seeing it with a friend ,we analyzed it for quite a while. The movie is interesting and unusual, but I couldn't help the feeling that it was too much ,too soon for people like us. As youngsters, far away of marriage problems, the occurrences has made us feel uneasy and upset us.It's like we'd got an opportunity to take a glance at the future to come, only to become quite confused... I should stress that the film doesn't deal only with marriage,  there are more subjects on the agenda. Still, the main criteria is the familiy and the turmoils it goes through in our age - the materialistic,lonely,alienated,stressing age.It's a heavy film, burdensome and saddening. There are some moments of laughter , but the atmosphere is clearly the above. A memorable scene comes in the end, when a whole new outlook over death is presented, to my opinion the brightest ,but then again, the saddest moment in the film.To end with, I think that young folks shouldn't watch it, it will only confuse them as it confused me . For older ,I don't know ,maybe it represents some of their problems and dilema's. Anyway, it doesn't give a whole new remarkable point of view at these things, it only reflects the current status.	4.0	Suitable for the married ones .	2000-09-23	7	6	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A206EHAX1WVZ0H	Eric Adams	American Beauty epitomizes all the elements that can and do make film a unique art. Aside from a natural chemistry between the entire cast and a storyline that grips you to an ending that might possibly be one of the  most suspenseful whodunit's ever, the photography is the real beauty. The  use of juxtaposition and the subtle theme of making the ordinary beautiful  are tastefully and extraordinarily captured. Not since Pulp Fiction do I  think a film has so significantly raised the benchmark of ingenuity and  creativity. Best movie of the year hands down.	5.0	The Beauty of Film	2000-02-20	10	8	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3GPFHWJ1SSIHE	Eric B. Norris	There has been a lot of hype written about this movie, and a lot of misunderstanding.  THIS FILM IS NOT A COMEDY.  It is not about  suburbia.  What it is about is the landscape of human passion.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is &quot;already dead&quot; and he knows it.  Then one day he meets the 17-year-old friend of his daughter, and Lester Burnham begins to wake up.  Lester is stunned by the young woman (Mena Suvari), and lusts after her.  This is the first of many points in the movie that are misleading if taken too literally.  This movie is not about a middle-aged man lusting after a 17-year old girl, it is about a middle-aged man reconnecting with the passion he once felt.  Suvari's character is the stalking horse for Lester's passion.  Lester reconnects with his own passion for life by first feeling this sexual desire for a girl who is forbidden to him.  But it doesn't end there.  Eventually Lester develops, or redevelops, into a man filled with passion and love, and an almost Zen-like desire to see others fulfilled.  Later in the film when Lester confronts his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) in a situation where Lester has been wronged and could really be angry with her, he says, &quot;it's ok, Caroline, I want you to be happy.&quot;  In the end, Lester comes full circle and even the situation with Suvari's character changes.American Beauty is chock full of excellent performances by the cast.  There is a lot to this movie, and it lends itself well to multiple viewings on DVD.  I've seen American Beauty three times in the theater and countless times on DVD--I still get something new out of each viewing.  The DVD itself has a moderate number of extras (the Awards Edition), more than you'd find on a regular DVD, but not as many as say the Fight Club DVD which could only be described as loaded.  The only thing I found a bit irritating was that the movie was already a success by the time some of the DVD extras got added.  This slightly changes the perspective of the people involved.  But this is a minor complaint.  American Beauty is indeed a masterpiece.	5.0	The Best Film of 1999, Maybe the Best Film of the Decade	2001-08-20	8	3	5
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2PGA1US5M697Y	Eric	Get ready for the real America with &quot;American Beauty.&quot;  A movie with all forms of cinema categories:  there is comedy, suspence,drama, fantasy, etc. Topics of everyday life tumble with everyday families: pot,  adultery, betrayal, abuse, homosexuality, and obsession; all rolled into  one. This is just the type of movie that speaks the truth about everyday  living, and how beauty is blind to a lot of people.  The casting couldn't  be better, the acting couldn't be better; definitely to go down as a  classic.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	When people say that this is the best movie of 1999, they are absolutely correct. This is a touching, sometimes funny, and sometimes heartbreaking film from Sam Mendes. It takes a look at the dark sides (as well as the fun sides) of suburban America. The film doesn't condemn this specific lifestyle, but it doesn't pay tribute to it, either. It's an examination on many of its unique aspects. Kevin Spacey's character Lester is at the heart of the story: here is a man who can't stand his job and is inspired (by his daughter's best friend) to regain his youth. This may be an unoriginal plot (and some of the characters), but it's the way it's executed that makes it so effective. The realism surrounding Lester and his family is almost to a T. Carolyn, his wife, is almost unlikable because of her materialistic fixations. But then again, Annette Bening gives a completely compelling performance. The younger actors (Birch as Jane, Bentley as Ricky, and Suvari as Angela) also give fine performances. Chris Cooper almost steals the show as the supposedly homophobic military man.Filled with impressive imagery, clever symbolism, and a memorable music score from Thomas Newman, I'd say that American Beauty is indeed the best film of 1999. It deserved all the awards it received. It's an American classic, and I think it's going to become one of my favorite films in the future.Grade: 9.5 out of 10	5.0	Tales of American Suburbia	2013-09-25	1	1	0

I knew a little bit about it from watching the oscars back in 1999 and from word-of-mouth.  It is a pretty good movie story wise, though a little predictable at times.  All the characters can be relatable.  Kevin Spacey delivers a dramatic and comendable performance and Anette Bening is great too.  The acting in this movie was top notch.  I would have give it 5 stars it if werent for the predictibility in this movie.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2LO5XLG3G50PL	Eric Swanger	There are some moments in time where you begin to ackowledge the fragility of life.  Sometimes it comes in the shape of a personal experience, or you might witness it through someone else's lives around you.  Or in this circumstance, a lesson may also become revealed in a piece of art.  I must admit that when I went to see &quot;American Beauty&quot; upon release in the theatres, I knew that I was going to see a film that was really groundbreaking.  I heard all the buzz on TV, read about it online and in the papers, but considering I am a world-class skeptic-I had to see the evidence for myself.Well, I was totally astounded.  I think that &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a deeply moving film on so many levels.  At its core, I suppose it is a film about redemption, or possibly self-redemption.  But there are so many other issues that the film brings to the surface:Distant family relationships, teenage maladgustment and alienation, love versus sex, vanity versus true happiness, amung many others.  And the true strength of the film is that these issues are brought up in a very honest eloquence, mainly due to a terrific assemblage of characters by Alan Ball and a really fantastic cast of actors.  Each character is very different on the surface, but upon examination, they are all struggling with very similar issues of identity, some fairing better than others.  Another great thing about the script is that each character is given the opportunity to really confront their problems, and we get to see how their decisions tend to bleed into the lives of those around them.  Its not difficult to identify with these people, because their situations are so common in all our lives.  But I think that it isnt often that a film can capture so many truly moving moments, however hilarious, heartbreaking, or disturbing all at once.The movie also has a lot of style.  There are many repetitious uses of symbols and irony, gorgeous cinematography, a deeply moving and complimentary score by Thomas Newman, and a real sense of tension through editing and environments.  I cant think of a movie in the past decade that really succeeds at defining it's own &quot;look&quot; as AB does.  There are slow motion shots, weird camera angles, strange uses of color, but all integral in the quest to push the film's agenda.  There are a lot of moments in &quot;American Beauty&quot; that really transcend what is being offered in modern moviemaking.  It is a very concise, quiet, funny, sad and monumental film all at the same time.  It is terribly entertaining on one hand and heartbreaking the next.  And in my opinion, it deserves all the attention it received, even just for having the audacity to bring up the issues that it did.  But to do it with the sensitivity and elegance that it accomplished is truly extraordinary.The DVD is really great.  The behind the scenes part on the menu is mediocre, but i really enjoyed watching the movie with the commentary by Sam Mendes and Alan Ball.  They really communicate what it entailed to bring the script to life, technically and artistically.  Its pretty fascinating.	5.0	Transcendant...really...	2001-07-25	5	0	5

Am I  missing something?  Aren't we all, in some way, functioning outside the  parameters of our factory specs?  Or are &quot;things,&quot; such as $4000  sofas and illicit relationships, what our Designer had in mind for us to  pursue?This movie, through brilliant and understated acting, takes us  into the lives of people who are dealing with these questions in  drastically different ways.  The film's haunting, slow-paced honesty sits  down beside you and casually drapes an arm over your shoulder.  The  question is whispered in your ear as you stare straight ahead:  &quot;Do  you see yourself in any of these people?&quot;  And, as the plot twists  tighter toward the end with surprising energy, you realize that you've been  suckered into jumping aboard a hurtling train that's headed toward a ravine  with the bridge washed out.  Washed out by the power of small, but deadly  choices--choices we all face at some point in our family histories.Just  as Kevin Spacey's character begins to turn from the brink and see the  beauty of his own wife and daughter, the dark honesty of his choices  catches up with him.  We are left to decide for ourselves which is more  dangerous--to jump off the train or to jump on as it hurtles toward the  danger of &quot;American Beauty.&quot;  Either way you jump, the impact of  the landing will leave you stunned at the end of the film.	4.0	Take the Jump	2000-06-05	7	4	3

The story is poignant, beautifully told and acted, and somehow very close to home for many of the people who see it. Suburban family life looks very neat and happy but who knows what kinds of complex problems lie beneath the surface? This film shows us a glimpse of that bitter reality. Marriages fall apart, people change but change in different ways from each other, people alienate each other, parents beat their children, parents ignore their children, parents are humans with human desires, people have nervous breakdowns, people have affairs, people hate their jobs, kids lie about their personal lives to try to be cool, people build facades... it is a wicked and vicious game society as a whole plays, and this film brilliantly conveys all the plots, subplots and layers that occur everyday.

We find beauty in things never before realized to be so. A simple shopping bag can tell a vast array  of stories and deliver unforgettable images. At the end, after the  conclusion, the camera does a slow zoom-out of the neighborhood. This, in  my view, is the most brilliant element of the film. It starts with a  zoom-in and ends with an -out.

I don't know what the point is anymore?&quot;  I know you have, because at one point or another, everyone has.  This film gives an incredible insight into  the &quot;average American family.&quot;From the midlife crisis father  (played incredibly by Kevin Spacey, I might add)  to the power driven  mother, the rebellious daughter, the innocent friend who wants to be a  woman before her time, the new neighbors next door who don't quite seem  normal...who doesn't know these people?  These everyday characters are  brought on a journey, an piece of everyday life for most people in some  aspects, but while looking in on them one can find startling  revilations.It begins with the faintest of hints, in the begining of the  film, with a small sign on Lester's (Spacey's) desk at work, which reads  &quot;Look Closer.&quot;  If someone were to ask me what the point of the  film is, that is it.  Look closer.  This theme is played out throughout the  film.The new boy next door exposes Jane to the beauty in the little  things, things that we, as a society, take for granted every day.  He also  awakens Lester, pulls him out of his every day slump, with the help of  Jane's cheerleader friend of course.Ahh..the cheerleader friend.  Some  may say that this display of a married man lusting toward a teenage girl is  disgusting.  I disagree..the display was needed in the film to portray the  loss of innocence of a girl, something that happens too much in our  society, the refinding of innocence of a man.Glancing at this family  and their lives, we might say that they are boring, typical; and so we all  are.  But upon closer inspection we see that it's the little things that  make them special, the little things that make life worth living.  As  simple as a plastic bag blowing in the wind, life is a beautiful thing.This film is a beautiful and inspiring work, for me along with others I  know.  Open your mind and look past the ovious, to find something  beautiful.  Look closer.	5.0	Look Closer	2000-07-11	6	4	2

With all the recent films I've watched in the past few years, I admit I became a bit jaded and not at all interested in all the 'best films' like this year but I am glad I went back and visited the Best Film from 1999.

Result: the movie is being acclaimed by American and international press and, due to its favoritism (American Beauty is the winner of three Golden Globes: best screenplay, director and picture). And it is just Sam Mendes' first film.""American Beauty"" is one of those unusual motion pictures, that eventually arises to show that the industry of American cinema is not restricted to commercial productions to be consumed by the public, without any sense of criticism. It is a light narrative, which constantly sways between comedy and drama, starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, that concerns the appearances of our lives, based on the relationship of a suburban and contemporary American family. What the movie try to and does demonstrate is that, in fact, nothing is what appears to be. (that is why the movie tagline ""... look closer"" makes sense) In ""American Beauty"", almost all the characters pretend or seem to be what they really don't are. All except Lester Burnham, the character performed by Kevin Spacey, who, with nothing to lose, do vanish all appearances, starting to behave like a teenager, as a try to escape from the familiar coma. Slowly, this brilliant story discard the apparent American beauty. There is no more American way of life, there is just life. And the beauty can be found in the most ordinary things of life. We just need to look closer. And this is the essence of the movie, this is what makes it special, an excellent American film, with excellent screenplay, direction and performances.Hollywood makes history with ""American Beauty"", marking a time of turning its attention to more mature and better written scripts. Now, it is going to be perfect if the public accepts this new style of American movie and start to face cinema as an art and not a mere entertainment. So, take a look!

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A26RNXBY42VYH4	fast_matt	"""American Beauty"" is incredible - a tragicomic look at suburbia, maintaining appearances, wasted life, beauty, ugliness, and a whole slew of other things.  The scary thing is that it's only slightly exaggerated - I've SEEN some of these people, and the excellent acting merely serves to bring to light the personal foibles many of us ignore on a daily basis because we're so used to them.It leads the viewer to ask, ""What does life mean to ME?"", but doesn't provide the cookie-cutter answer some may seek.The disconcerting juxtaposition of things of things traditionally considered ""beautiful"" and ""ugly"", often in the same person, highlights the hazards of being quick to judge and categorize others.  The beautiful woman stripping to red lingerie... to scrub and dust a house clean.  The drug dealer... who is sensitive and finds beauty in everything.Possessions taking the place of passion.  Appearances taking precedence over expression.  As Lester states rather vehemently, ""It's JUST STUFF!!!""I couldn't agree more.  If you like to see the world as black-and-white, good-and-evil, and are willing to bend reality a bit to maintain the illusion, this movie will disturb you.However, I have yet to see a more moving case for being true to yourself and making the most of your time on this planet."	5.0	"""It's just STUFF!!!"	2002-06-30	0	0	0

Some scenes are good; a few are memorable...but it's been about two months since I watched the DVD and I CANNOT REMEMBER the beginning, end or much of the middle of the movie.  Somehow, it didn't stick, and my mind must have been drifting.I'm not an afficionado of dark comedy...and this is such a film.  I found nothing to much appreciate in nearly all the characters...and some of them (like the father/marine with homophobia) are such cardboard, two-dimensional stereotypes that nothing they do is memorable...you've seen it all before in real life or in the movies.  There just isn't anything new here.Don't waste much money on this one...just rent it if you feel the need to see it.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1UZJY4DY46B5K	Felecia Constance Rowe	Strange, Wierd, Provocative. Spacey is brilliant as the advertising executive burnout that transforms the great idea into a collective masterpiece of interweaving performances. Lester Burnhamn, and his equally burned-out, nervous-wreck, wheeling-dealing, real estate saleswoman Bening, is looking for what he lost in high school, while she is figuring out why she is a lousy salewoman. And Spacey finds it in the drug dealer kid next door (whose Marine father happens to be a closet homosexual of all things) and the GIRL - Mena Suvari.Mena Suvari, despite her constant prouncements she's a sex queen, gets the hots for Spacey after he got the hots for her at the basketball game (?)--I was too busy watching Spacey ogle the Girl to notice where they were at. In the end, she was a ... well, watch.Spacey quits his job, blackmails his boss, and goes completely beserk until finding himself. Bening, not sure why they are married, meets the Real Estate King (Peter Gallagher) and finds her own sexual adventure into forbidden territory. Their repressed daughter then falls in love with the drug dealer of all ironies. Dysfunctional family. You think?If you're a guy and want to relive wanting the high school cheerleader of your dreams, and if you're a woman wanting to understand why a guy (or your husband) wants to relive wanting the high school cheerleader of his dreams, this is for you. At any rate, pure art bleeds from this film by Dreamworks. It is one of the top ten of all time.All in all, Spacey gives yet another knock-out performance (his best in my opinion) and the ensemble cast is deliriously funny and seriously deft and decidely--human. A don't miss! [...]P.S - Criticisms of the sexual nature of the film are really ridiculous since it is a taboo and does happen in the minds of all men. Men are not pedophiles just for wanting THE GIRL; they are just reliving a high school experience. [...] It is also why over 50% of Britney Spears' dolls were bought by men over 30.

I've seen this film over 15 times by now, and ever time I watch it, I realize there's still more to the film. The first time I saw, it, I felt it was undoubtedly the funniest film I had ever seen. It was very depressing at the same time. It took me a few more times to really absorb how dark and sad it really was. This film makes you life and smacks you in the face with the harsh realities of life at the same time.The screenplay by Alan Ball is the most spectacular work of literature since Catcher in the Rye. His acerbic wit, and gentle heart in his writing are a perfect match for the film.With brilliant performances by Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley, Peter Gallagher and Allison Janney, this film delivers the best ensemble cast you have ever seen.Kevin Spacey shines as the deeply confused Lester Burnham who is trapped in the harsh realities of the world. From his facial expressions to the sarcastic wit in his voice, Spacey delivers like he always does, but this time, not only does he leave a mark in cinematic history, but a mark in the hearts of the movie goers.Sam Mendes proves that first time is the charm in his debut effort. He never has to make a movie again after this. And if he does, bless him for it, but I tell him to never compete with American Beauty, for nothing can beat it. American Beauty is more than just a film. It's art. It's a masterpiece!Conrad Hall delivers cinematography that will amaze you. His smart cloes-ups, and voyeuristic shots make this film even more fun.This film really did show me the beauty in our world, and at the same time, the beauty in cinema. If only all films were as powerful and dare I say, beautiful, as this movie, our lives would be better.If you haven't seen American Beauty, something's wrong with you. But don't worry, you still have time to redeem yourself! Get down to the video stores immediately and start laughing untill you cry, and at the same time, cry untill your laughing.	5.0	Glorious!

It is a not-so-subtle attack on middle class American values and institutions.  Targets are the American Military, Marriage, gun ownership, corporate America/capitalism, consumerism, traditional morals and sexual mores etc....The only thing the writers left out was religion--none of the cast of dysfunctional people were church going christians.  I am sure this was a oversight.  The title was off putting because it suggests that Americans have empty, dysfunctional, meaningless lives. This film is a left-wing diatribe with a social agenda to bash american society using many liberal cliches and unlikable, one-dimensional characters.  Maybe I read too much into it.The only semi normal, healthy people were the two gay neighbors; everyone else is a mess.  Of course, the worst writing came with the new family next door with the father being a Marine Colonel.  He was portrayed as a domineering man incapable of expressing his feelings and love for his family.  He imposed harsh discipline and physical abuse for even minor infractions.  Of course he had a large gun collection and Nazi memorabilia.  His disdain for his gay neighbors is on complete display and of course we find out that this disdain is only there to hide his own latent homosexuality.  How tiresome!  The realtor/wife of the main character builds confidence and feels ""powerful"" by learning to shoot a gun.  The only semi-likable character is Kevin Spacey's who is a guy in a mid-life crises brought on by his own sexual frustration and infatuation with---the friend of his daughter.  He quits his job, and tells off those corporate creeps.  He black mails them into a year's salary.  We are supposed to feel okay about that because they deserve it.  Then he pursues and seduces his daughters best friend.  In the process he buys the car he wanted as a teenager, starts smoking pot again and listens to rock music.  The only redemption for him comes at the end when he doesn't go through with the little affair he had been planning--but he comes awful close.  The message of this film is: don't be uptight-express your feelings, smoke pot and have sex.  Sounds a bit like turn on, tune in and drop out.  A classic film for 60's rejects.The artistry in this film comes in the way it is told on the screen.  It moves along at a nice pace and keeps you off-balance and guessing.  There are a few poetic scenes when the neighbor boy and son of the marine talks about his desire to film and his contemplation of beauty, which gives the film its title.  I don't care to see it again."	3.0	artistic attack on middle class values	2008-11-29	8	2	6
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3CWH6VKCTJAD	"""flickjunkie"""	I was eager to see this once available on rental because I was wondering what all the fuss was about.  After having seen it, I'm still wondering.  At the risk of inducing a lot of indignant e-mail, I have to say that I  didn't think this film was all that great.  As a matter of fact, it was  only somewhere between okay and good.Admittedly, it was an effective  lampoon of American culture, with the clear message that life is ironic and  we need to get our priorities straight.  But it was far from a defining  moment in cinematic history, as has been implied in all the hype.  The fact  that it is being referred to as one of the greatest movies of all time  sends me an even more frightening message about American culture than the  film itself.The film had a sardonic tone and a wry style, most certainly  by design, but it was taken to excess to the point of being bizarre and  cartoonish.  The humor was sophomoric, the characters were more like  caricatures than people, and everything in the film was dreadfully clich&eacute;.  The story gets high marks for irreverence, but not for realism or  subtlety.The direction by Sam Mendes, other than that of the actors, was  really nothing special.  Other than a few vista shots, some rose petal  shots and the dancing paper bag, it was visually pretty mundane.  It was  also structurally unsound as a first person narrative.  The narrative  format is from the speaker's perspective and implicitly must limit itself  to events the speaker experienced directly or of which he had indirect  knowledge.  The film included numerous scenes and conversations of which  Lester could not possibly have had any knowledge by the end of the film.  That's just sloppy storytelling.The one area where this film shines is  the acting.  Though I don't agree with the character interpretations, the  character presentations were superb.  Kevin Spacey was fantastic as Lester.  He got better as the movie progressed as he was allowed to break out of  his caricature.  Annette Benning was not allowed that luxury, but played  the fanatical yuppie role to the hilt.  Thora Birch as daughter Jane had  the good fortune of playing the only realistic character in the entire  movie.  She was quite impressive, playing the part with a sensitivity and  poise belying her experience as an actress.This was a decent film, no  more, no less.  There were so many excellent films in 1999, that it is hard  for me to understand this film's mass appeal.  Perhaps we have become so  overwrought as a society that this film struck a chord.  That is decidedly  to its credit, but it doesn't make it a great film.  I rate it a 6/10.  A  huge disappointment.	3.0	Okay but not great	2000-05-14	7	5	2

And so he thinks to himself: Ha! I'll try my hand at feature film writing! Result: A feature film that plays like a grade-b t.v. sitcom.This film completely and totally panders to stereotypical self-righteous liberal values. ""The emptiness of the institution of marriage, the emptiness of child-rearing, the emptiness of capitalism, the emptiness of life itself.""  And also: ""Don't blame people, the victims of all of this nonsense and insanity.""This film completely overlooks the fact that not one of its characters (and I mean CHARACTERS) even mildly attempts to lift a finger to find themselves out of their morass. Instead, they wallow in it.  Not one of these self-indulgent, self-righteous, hedonistic, self-centered, self-absorbed people attempts to critique themselves and look in the mirror.  Their problems are the fault of everybody and everything else.So what are we supposed to think, walking out of the movie theatre...?  Trouble with your marriage?  Get divorced.

The only thing that lurks below the surface of American Beauty is hate...skillet-deep, self-indulgent HATE. Similarly, the film does nothing to show what ""looking closer"" (its mantra) does for anyone aside from turning them into pitiful/pitiless scumbags. Example: after their epiphany with the paper/trash and Spacey's death, the two kids look coldly at the dead father and then turn to belittle the cheerleader (Suvari) on their way out the door. What sort of humanity or beauty is there in this? Suvari turns out to be the only humane character in the flick, and these two droids tell her SHE'S got problems and is essentially trash? Please. According to the director their actions are supposed to be the closing of a circle of sorts. I.e. The boy again sees beauty in an unlikely place. Again, please. The kids are vampires, sucking on beauty with no intention or ability to pass it on, much less radiate it. This is only one example of the utter lack of depth and humanity of American Beauty.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2BPDFR58H9575	Galina	"American Beauty is a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" film, and you never know if it has more 'love it' or 'hate it' viewers. Personally, I love it -from the first sight, from the last sight, from the eternal sight. It is my favorite film of the 90s, one of my personal twenty favorites ever. I think that American Beauty is an instant classic, and it will stay that way as long as people watch movies.The film is deep, dark, and tragic. The title is American Beauty but it is more like Universal Sadness. It is not about superheroes - it is about very flawed, tired, and shallow people - but just as the tag line says - one must look closer.I live in a town like the one in American Beauty too - nice houses, brick, vinyl, neatly cut grass and flowers. ""The air is fresh and sweet like a child's kiss"". I jog in the mornings or in the evenings and people often sit on their porches or water their lawns or jog just as I do. We always smile at each other and say ""Hi, how are you?"" I always think to myself - what goes on beyond the closed doors of these people that I see? They could be happy with their families and with their jobs. They do look happy. Or, they may be tired and disappointed with their lives, trying to do something to change it - or just letting the days pass by.Leo Tolstoy opened his novel Anna Karenina with the words, ""All happy families are happy in the same way; each unhappy family is unique in its unhappiness"". That's why it is much more interesting for me to try and understand each unhappy family - why did it happen? The family in American Beauty used to be happy - there is even proof - the photograph with three of them, happy, laughing. Where did it go? When? Why? When was the moment in time when two loving people became strangers and prisoners in their own nice house with the beautiful roses outside? These are the questions I kept thinking about when I saw AB for the first time, and I still can not find the answers. Can something be changed? How? What do you do to wake up from the lethargic dream that your life has become? How do you reach the people who are the closest to you? What the hell do you need a $3000 couch for if you can not make love to your wife on it? What is the purpose of material possessions if they become more important than the smile of your daughter? When did you start to think that giving your children the best toys possible would substitute for a talk, for a sincere and honest interest as to what they really worry about? I did not find American Beauty patronizing and simplistic - it asks difficult questions but does not provide you with any easy answers. I still look for those answers. I don't blame the movie for imperfection of its characters - I know they do exist. We don't like them - but can one be mad when looking in the mirror? I want to add a couple of words about Spacey's character, Lester Burnham (BTW, Spacey may stop acting right now, and he probably should after all the flops he has produced since AB, but he will always be remembered for Lester). Lester could say about himself what another flawed but unforgettable character did 25 years before him: ""Well, I tried, didn't I? Goddamnit, at least I did that."" Lester Burnham died a happy man; the last words he heard in his life were that his daughter was in love - it meant for him that she could feel, that she was alive because love changes us and makes us better. His last sight was that of a picture where happiness and joy were captured forever. In death, he had at last captured that for which he had longed for the most in life - happiness.He died a happy man - not many do."	5.0	My Favorite Film From the 90s	2006-07-11	10	8	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	"The Burnhams are a typical, upwardly mobile family: a father with a well-paid job in advertising, a mother who is a driven real estate sales agent, an angst-ridden teen age daughter who is at an age to despise her parents.  They live in a lovely home with a white picket fence, lovely roses, and a red door.  Everything about them projects an image of success.  And yet-- Lester (Kevin Spacey) hates his advertising job, which makes him feel like a prostitute selling second rate wares to stupid johns.  Caroline (Annette Benning) is frustrated at being second-best in the real estate business.  Daughter Jane (Thorah Birch) finds both of her parents vapid and doubts her own validity as a person--particularly when compared with her beautiful, sexed-up best friend Angela (Mena Suvari.)  Their lives, like the lives of so many others rushing ""to get ahead in the world,"" have become less about actually living than about maintaining and improving upon the appearance of success so prized by society.What is most astonishing about the film is its complete believability.  Speaking as one who has worked a great deal in advertising and sales, I was amazed with the accuracy with which Ball's powerful and darkly funny script captured the lives of those whose values rest exclusively upon external achievement--Lester's growing and barely concealed hatred for advertising and Caroline's constant use of self-help tapes and personal success mantras are truly commonplace in the business world.  Now, if AMERICAN BEAUTY were merely this and nothing more, it would still be an astonishing film.  But it goes considerably further than that--for Lester, suddenly motived by a lust for his daughter's friend Angela, realizes how completely unenjoyable ""keeping up appearances"" has become.  And he explodes the status quo in such a way as to bring every one's petty materialism and mask-like personaes into a sharp, very funny, and pitch-black focus as the shallow and meaningless things they are.  And in the process he both finds and destroys himself forever.The cast is astonishing throughout, with Kevin Spacey the ultimate ""I Can't Take It Any More"" man and wife Annette Benning the ultimate vision of every hard-core sales representative it has ever been my misfortune to meet, a woman determined to ""project an image of success at all times"" even if it kills her.  Thora Birch is a remarkable young performer, as is her boyfriend Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari is perfectly cast as the youthful beauty for whom Spacey develops an unexpected passion. Mendes' direction is flawless here, and he navagates the both the complicated appearances of success and the personal shallowness it conceals with tremendous clarity, never overplaying his hand in either direction.  Perhaps the most telling bits of the film are among the most subtle, as when the film posits the tiresomely yuppie but nonetheless considerably more honest gay couple next door as more genuine than the Burhams, Caroline's eternal efforts at ego building through motivational tapes, and the way in which Angela (in time honored teenage fashion) niavely attempts to use sex as a weapon to conceal her own insecurities.The film is extremely funny, but it is also ultimately devastating.  A great many people--particularly those who equate ""an image of success"" with successful lives, will despise the film.  But like it or not, AMERICAN BEAUTY's take on the failure on the failure of the American dream is easily the most successful and deadly accurate satire on life in these United States since the equally wicked NETWORK.  This is the real thing, people--and it may be too close to home for many.  Watch it at your own risk.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3M5O6UHXO9IBU	Gary	I suspect the reason this film is so awful is due to studio politics and the compromises that have to be made to get projects off the ground in an increasingly prohibitively expensive medium. Certainly the director Sam Mendes had to abandon his first attempt, probably because the script is such piffle it's hard to make it work. He gave it his best shot, fair enough. This isn't the truth about America, it's one script writer's view of America and judging by his CV he has not done a great deal other than work in sitcom, which says a lot about the structure, approach and choices made in this film. Trite scenes such as the throwing of the plate (queue canned laughter) and Benning's unconvincing behaviour in selling a house for instance. Nothing works or convinces, especially the fatuous notion that a father should be murdered for 'ignoring' his sibling. I suspect the writer threw in other stuff garnered from 'Sex, Lies And Video Tape' and a tasteless who-dunnit element in an attempt to make the picture seem familiar and entertaining for the audience. The bottom line was always money, not profundity.I think I'm right in saying Geffin had a hand in backing this film and there has been talk recently of a 'gay clique' in Hollywood and it's influence behind the film'making scenes. I don't know if that's the case here but the gay couple are signalled straight away as being the happiest. The film also plugs the usual gay propaganda that anyone who dislikes gays must automatically be in the closet. The scene where such an alleged person punches his son full in the chest for touching a plate is particularly unconvincing and pernicious. The portrayal of the wife and women in general all seems to come from a certain questionable perspective.The so-called spiritual element about the nature of beauty produces an unbelievably laughable scene involving a bag. One character looks at the blood matter of a brain with a hippy dippy stare that seems to say &quot;Wow man, It's so bea-u-ti-ful!&quot; I cannot believe anyone takes these preposterous contrivances with dead birds and the like seriously. It's palpable nonsense.All this huffing and puffing just for a reactionary 'Wizard Of Oz' homily about a family picture and 'there's no place like home.' The film then proceeds with some sentimental voice-over guff about leaves and the loss of youth. As the camera pulls back over suburbia and the patronising final sentiments are spoken, we can almost hear the film-makers behind the screen giggling &quot;My God, are they really BUYING all of this?&quot; Well, sadly the majority of people are sheep.The reality is that America has oppressed a large number of weaker and poorer countries over the last three decades in the guise of fighting Communism. Very few people seem to be aware of the real horror that has gone on in central America and America's hand in it, and the third world in general, at the expense and loss of life of the poorest in those societies. America is not the evil of the world but in the light of this enormous suffering and loss of an experience that only comes once to us all, are we really expected to care about the 'suffering' of Burnham and his wife and their arguments about damaging the sofa? Americans love this film because very few of them have suffered real injustice in their lives, the kind you suffer if you're born in Sudan, for instance. A price has been paid for such comforts and Americans should be grateful for the lives they have, and not whinge. Materialism does not necessarily mean a loss of inner worth or that you can deepen your world. Many have been freed to pursue personal expression, such as making drivel like this film. Be grateful for what you have in the time we have left, which in the face of increasing weapon super-technology attainment, may not be long.American Beauty's sincerity is disingenuous. It flatters to deceive. It's purpose is to make Americans feel safe and good about themselves so that the people behind it will be successful and make money. There is a machine that has to be fed and a huge amount of talentless people are out there figuring increasingly desperate ways to do so. 'American Beauty' incapsulates all that is glib, meretricious and plain wrong about modern cinema and as such, in my opinion, it is one of the very worst films ever made.	1.0	*SPOILERS*	2001-01-05	40	19	21

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AY12DBB0U420B	Gary Peterson	"Last night's movie was ""American Beauty"" (awards edition) and it came off our DVD shelves. We watched it about 6 years ago but I barely remembered it except for a few scenes.Well, what can I possibly say for a movie that has over a thousand Amazon reviewers? I'm not even going to try to add anything new, just give a few of my impressions. It's an excellent movie. Without question. Just look at the review ratings. Look at the awards and critical acclaims it has received. Well, folks, it has earned those awards and accolades, but you might not particularly enjoy the movie.The acting is excellent, right across the board. First rate! The characters come across as real people in real life. Kevin Spacey, in particular, stands out and is the only person in the cast that I can sympathize with. All the rest deserve their fate, in my opinion, but that's getting a bit ahead.  The story involves an ordinary family (father, mother, teen-age daughter) in an ordinary small city (possible midwestern) living in an ordinary tree-lined street. The teen-age daughter has a best friend, I might add, who enters the picture and her mother has a real-estate colleague, who likewise enters into the story. Early in the movie, A marine and his family (father, mother, teen-age son) move in next door. Well, all of the main characters are dysfunctional in some of the worst possible ways. It's a social nightmare. Hopefully, this kind of thing can happen only in Hollywood depictions, but we all know, as we view the film, that it's happening all around us wherever we happen to live. The end result is the death of the lead  character in an abrupt and graphic way. The movie comes across as a type of comedy in many places and you'll be laughing from time to time, but it''s not a comedy, folks. It's tragic from beginning to end and there are no winners. Everyone loses.It's a good movie., Very well done. There's no crying here. None of the characters are the least bit sympathetic. I can easily see how it got so many awards.Gary Peterson"	5.0	Tragic From Beginning to End.	2012-02-28	2	1	1

This was a fine movie with some great writing and acting.  I even like the plot a lot.  I only have two qualms with the movie:1) the alienation in the  suburbs motiff has been done before.  It's just too much.  The plus side is  that the message is multi-layered so it is worth repeat viewing to just  examine what exactly the story is critiquing.  You know it is complaining  about something, but the story is too engrossing to bother thinking too  hard about it on the first viewing.  But after you see it again and you  think about it, I found it too preachy.  In a liberal, holier-than-thou  sort of way.  Maybe I'm reading too much into it, I don't know.  The movie  aimed high and achieved a lot...That's why I leave off a star.  You could see this coming a mile away.  You  just have to acquainted with leftist dogmas.  You see, everyone who  disagrees or hates gays is just self-repressing their own emotions.  Shallow, shallow, shallow.	4.0	good movie, too much propaganda	2000-08-11	4	2	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1FS9R0JXHLHEG	George Annessa	"This film is one of a kind. After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach. It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism. However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind. Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only add to the drama of this film. I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time. I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it. I don't think it could have been any better.Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating. However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film. While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind. I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.While billed by some as a ""comedy-drama"", I don't see anything about this film as funny. Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty. But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list."	5.0	A Well Deserved Oscar...	2004-05-03	3	2	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1WOFFWF8UYPJ2	Gerald Booth	American Beauty:Have you ever just gone through the motions of life? You get your degree, get married, have the requisite child, and then go on autopilot. Day after day you struggle out of bed&#65533;maybe kiss your wife hello&#65533;maybe not&#65533;.grunt at your child and struggle in to work. You manage to smile and slink your way through the day and then it is back home again. You struggle through a meal with your wife and child where neither pays the least bit of attention to you and then it is off to bed. This is where it really gets fun since your wife wants to have nothing to do with you at this point. How would this make your feel or act? Better yet how would you act if suddenly you woke up and saw what was happening to your once promising life? American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes, and written by Alan Ball explores this scenario and the consequences that follow.Lester Burnam has the life I described above. His wife, Carolyn, and his daughter, Jane, really have nothing to do with him. Carolyn has become the homemaker from hell with perfect meals accompanied by the sound track to South Pacific every night. She makes a living outside of the house as a real estate agent and seems to be having more success at it than Lester does in his job with a magazine, and she doesn&#65533;t let Lester forget this. Lester&#65533;s daughter Jane is going through all the typical high school angst trying to figure out where she fits in and she has no interest in having Dad as part of her life.Everything changes the night Carolyn drags Lester out to see Jane and her dance team perform at the high school game. As Lester blearily observes the performance his eyes are slowly drawn towards Jane&#65533;s friend, Angela. While he is watching her something in him begins to awaken and stir. She is a blond vision of sex drenched dreams.Shortly thereafter Lester attends a work function with his wife. While Carolyn is making eyes with the top realtor in the area, Lester comes upon his new teenage neighbor working as a waiter. They end up out back in the alley talking about life and, well for lack of a better word, smoking dope. When the headwaiter appears to chastise his errant waiter Lester is amazed to see him tell his boss where he can stick his job. The creature that was stirred by Angela is now fully inspired.Throughout the rest of the movie we see how Lester reacts to everyone that formerly had some means of control over him. The consultant at his job, his wife, and even his daughter are amazed but not necessarily pleased by the new Lester. The movie continues from this point showcasing how Lester, Carolyn, and Jane all react to the changes in life and how it effects each of them.Kevin Spacey plays Lester as if he was born to this role. He starts off the movie barely able to move from room to room. The bathroom scene shows how is wife has affected him and his despair at going to work shows through as he is barely able to stay awake. His wife runs roughshod over him and he crumbles. When he begins to undertake his transformation Spacey takes us a little step each time showing the Lester that once was as he comes forward. Spacey&#65533;s timing and dialogue skills are shown to great heights throughout. He turns a simple sentence, &#65533;I rule!&#65533; into a battlecry for all downtrodden men. Very few actors could have handled this as well.Annette Bening, as Carolyn, also does a fine job as his wife however many people could have handled this role as well. She runs the gambit from total controlling wife/mother to falling apart woman but something was missing in how she did it.Thora Birch, Jane, handled her part better than Bening. She had the teenager embarrassed to be seen with the parents down to a t. At the same time she also had her own awakening to the fact that she didn&#65533;t always have to play second fiddle to her star friend.This was an exceptionally well written movie. It did have some &#65533;artsy-fartsy&#65533; moments in it that slowed some of the scenes down but Spacey powered through them in one of his best performances yet. I highly recommend this film.	5.0	A Remarkeable Film.	2002-02-17	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ARHX8IX8TKJW8	"Gerhard Schroeter ""Bcherwurm"""	"How to escape the circuit of dreams that bind you? American Beauty, which shines through an exciting plot that leaves you thinking and moved tells the American Dream from the perspective of the protagonist, Lester Burnham, a family man who is going to fulfil his personal idea of the American Dream which ruins his family life in the end. The film has a circular structure, beginning with Lester, saying that he will be dead in less than one year and ending with a monologue by him when he's deceased.Lester is about to quit his work career just to get in touch with the most less amount of responsibility from now on. Moreover, he finds the friend of his own daughter Jane, a teenager, attractive and is completely lost in her.While Lester's wife Carolyn is having an affair and completely focused on her own career, Lester is doing his own stuff regardless of what's going on around him. He is even losing connection with his own daughter who starts to hate him due to his embarrassing behavior.And that is how things are in American Beauty: tricky and destructive: A trigger got pulled and there is nothing to do to push things into another direction.The characters are pretty coloured.We find Carolyn on the one hand, who is masquerading. Lost in her career, she is trying hard to keep a certain status, not accepting that her husband can't share her lifestyle anymore.She is one of those characters you feel pity for as a viewer.Lester in contrast of that is the typical movie hero. For realizing his dreams in a kind of innocent way, the things he wents through, for paying the bills in the end.The most incredibly played character is that of Ricky, a typical weirdo from the eyes of most people. The reason i mention him is because he deserves a special treatment for he is already at a point of life that Lester is trying to reach hard.The director, Sam Mendes,  is obiously  criticising  ""the AMERICAN way of DREAMing"" by all the symbols and sequences you can see that show and deal with the naked truth of life. All dreams that come along in this movie will be ruined in the end. What is all money and influence good for if you get never in touch with all the beauty life can offer ? One can't live with and not without the American Dream when there is no balance with life's beauty.I definitely recommend the film for the simple fact that it is dealing with life in a unique way.Once a movie can move you - it has done it's function. And if that movie can even entertain your mind, eyes and ears all at once, it must be worth watching. Clever and smart but also with shocking elements. A ying yang - movie: many contrasts that clash on each other but get balanced out in the end.By M. &Uuml;.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is this kind of guy who has forgotten to live even though he has reached the suburban-lifestyle a lot of people attempt to achieve. His wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) works as an estate agent and she is still filled with ambitions. Jane (Thora Birch), Carolyn and Lester's teenage daughter, goes to high school and attends the schools cheer leading group. The familiar situation begins to escalate as Lester recognizes that he cannot suffer the emotional side by side life any more. Motivated by Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), Jane's friend, who reactivates his long lost libido, he decides to drastically change his life conditions. Therefore he quits his ordinary office job in favor of applying as a Smiley Burgers(tm) service member like he used to in his childhood. He tries to regain his lost youth. But the familiar situation escalates even more.Even though Lester is one of the coolest characters towards the end of the movie, in the beginning of the movie he is a coward without confidence. As his character progresses, he appears more and more as a rebel. This character development is initiated by the self-awareness of his former boring and very common lifestyle. He tried to life a second youth, gaining the coolness and self-assurance he failed reaching in his first. This is a quite interesting development because in fact he already reached everything which is part of the common American Dream. He already had a family, a recognized job, a large house and two cars - but obviously these things were not the ones which made the point for him. Now he is trying to start over again, to reach a better relation with his daughter and wife and to finally enjoy life intentionally.On the other hand, there is Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Ricky is the son of the new neighbors of the Burnhams, he goes to the same school as Jane does. On the first sight he seems to be no more than a strange guy, but after a closer look he turns out to be sensitive and straight forward. Not in terms of realizing the material part of the American Dream, but in terms of living life intentionally. In this context Ricky is the exact opposite of Lester. At least, as the movie starts. As the movie progresses Lester continuously develops towards Ricky's attitude. And as it ends you hear him say what Ricky had already recognized long time ago.You might compare American Beauty to similar films but honestly there are no similar films, there is nothing comparable. American Beauty shows us a unique view on the American Dream particularly emphasizing the negative flipside of the American Dream. We never even considered how wrong and bad the American Dream could be. Our surfaces are mostly polished and cured from everything what could be considered as a bad trait but underneath this kind of masquerade the real needs become obvious. Namely the need to live how we really want, to live our lives with our unique way of American Dreaming and not just using what is commonly assumed as the typical American Dream template. We should learn to tailor our own dream, this is the message.All in all, we would fully recommend this movie, because it shows a shocking version of dozen failed American Dreams bunched in one or two families, contrary to the mostly used Happy-World-American-Dream. Did i say failed American Dreams? Failed - yes, in terms of family living and the pursuit of mental happiness. Failed - in terms of getting the suburb status, having a family, having a house, own a diversity of material goods - absolutely no. It depends on the point of view and what you define as failed in this case. The author emphasizes particularly every imaginable negative part to sensitize the audience and to assault their deep rooted picture of an American Dream. And this is the only one weakness of the film, it feels like science fiction. As the viewer I would say ""Nope, this would never ever concern me"" but with some more realistic circumstances the author could reach something you might say unreachable through films, namely a drastic change in our minds.Putting it all together, this movie is a typical example of persons forgetting to enjoy everyday life while they are pursuing their aim of a better life in the future. According to the path-goal theory, the journey is the reward. And even it all end in tears within this case study, it does point out the responsibility we all have and always forget - the responsibility not to forget to live.So, American Beauty isn't just a sort of roses as commonly assumed, it is even more a metaphor used in movie's title to concentrate the message in one striking word. Well, where is the beauty in our daily life? In fact it can be found everywhere, because it is everywhere. The sticking point is that we need to have the sensitivity to identify and feel it, no matter where it is. Does it sound strange to you that the beauty of our world can be found in a plastic bag? If yes, than you should definitely watch this movie.By C.V. and R.B.American Beauty is a story about a family with Lester (Kevin Spacey) and his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) who are stuck in their joyless and unlovely marriage. Their relationship is plodding aimlessly at this time. Both of them are unhappy with this situation. Carolyn is only focused on her career as estate agent. Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) finds her father disgusting because of his lack of communicating with her. Once he quits his job and starts his youth revival he works at a burger company, and lays eyes on his daughter's schoolfriend Angela (Mena Suvari), though, Lester is suddenly changing his whole life. Freed in his mind from the life that was strangling him. But everything has consequences.Carolyn, the third main character, is stubborn in her doing she wants to be the best estate agent and she is proud of her house and life standard. Jane is a beautiful girl but she don't see it. She want to have a normal family but her family is a shame for her. She is a person that gives people a chance and she tries to see behind a masquerade which is pointed out while she gets to know Ricky the new neighbour.The most interesting character seems to be Ricky, who is a supporting role but his behaviour is interesting too: he is a boy different from others. He is filming very much and often but he does it to see the good sides of life. He is filming things that are beautiful. In a scene he shows Jane his greatest film. And it shows a bag that is dancing with the wind. This shows me that there are always beautiful things. Carolyn is the character that I reject most because she is bitchy and too much focused on her job, her roses in the garden and her reached economic status.The director wants to express that the American Dream, namely to pursuit a better job, a better a house, a better family, a better life, etc. has consequences and he points out that it is very often a masquerade.For me the message of the film is to avoid being egoistic and live a life with a masquerade - but also to see the little beautiful parts of life.by J.F.The movie American Beauty deals with the last moments in life of Lester Burnham, who lives with his family in a suburb of an American city. The focus is on Lester's thoughts about his last days in life. The viewer gets an impression of his family and personal environment and, furthermore, it is possible to see the way people who are close to Lester live their American Dream. The film ends with the conclusion that everything is a masquerade.The main character is Lester. After he gets into his midlife-crises, he begins to live his American Dream. So he starts working out his body, he buys things he dreamt of his whole life (like a new car): He gets back to a life of drugs and Rock`n Roll and is in love with Angela, the friend of his daughter Jane. At the end of the movie you can see his soft character when he is in the situation of having sex with Angela and he finally refuses.  As an important aspect Lester is connected to all other characters of the story. He comes into a personal bond with every character.Instead of identifying  with only a single character of the movie, it is easier to identify with each character. Everyone wants to be successful as shown by Carolyn. Everybody aims (at least a bit) for beauty like Jane. Like Lester, many would like to be athletic, fit and enjoy life.Personally, I think it is very easy to reject someone in the story. Ricky's father, a brutal man who is not capable of dealing with his son and his wife in a lovely way. He also denies his feelings for men. The intention of the director was the suggestion to the public, namely to make themselves think about the meaning of life. Is the American Dream the meaning of life ? You can have the impression that the director criticizes the American Dream. The main message could be that the American Dream does not necessarily make everyone happy.Compared to movies I know this one has inspired people to think about their own lives and the way of life, as you are and how you want to be. Life can be very short. The American Dream could symbolically stand for the American society. On the surface, many things look pretty and beautiful. But inside it could mostly be broken. A strength of the film is the camera movements in combination with the sound. I like the presentation of the film, which begins with Lester's story and is repeated at the end. The weakness of the film is an exaggerated portrayal of the characters.Whoever has the desire and joy to a combination of a typical American film and American culture, should watch the movie. It is a film with a bit of irony and clich&eacute; as well as scenes with reflection.by I.A.American Beauty was released in 1999 and directed by S.Mendes. The film takes a look inside the suburban middle-class houses of some average families, at least by all appearances. The focus is on Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and their daughter Jane (Thora Birch). All of them are missing something in their lives, and everyone of them has its own way to compensate these absentees, but neither of them knows how to solve their problems.Lester Burnham is a middle-class man with a daughter who doesn't love him and with a wife who spends more attention on her career than on her family. There is also the fact of his mid-life crisis, which makes him feel old and unloved. At this point he finds himself fantasizing about Jane`s school friend Angela (Mena Suvari), due to that he starts to rebel, he quiets his job and began to work at a fast food restaurant. During her father is living his 20s again, Jane recognizes his sort of interest for Angela and that gains her dislike for him.The characters who surround Lester and his family are equally fascinating, for example Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper), who doesn`t introduce himself without mentioning his army background and rank. His wife seems mentally disturbed due to the constant struggle between her son and her husband which is caused by his drug dealing history. Their son is a quiet guy who videotapes everything and seems to be a ""tech geek"", he finances himself, by still selling drugs.All these characters are unified by one thing, they are hunting for their ""American Dream"". Not one of these characters is really bad, some of them are likeable and even loveable. The movie creates rather of a mood than a actual theme or message, even that mood is hard to describe. You have to see it, that even by seeing it you may not understand it. All I know is I would recommend this movie for its interpersonal relationships, its black humor and its amount of hope by the end.by. K.-H. S.In American Beauty we see Lester and his family who are broken. The American Dream is a problem for them. Lester doesn't like his job anymore. He quits and changes his life style. He wants youth and is in love with a teenager. Her name is Angela and she is the friend of Jane who is the daughter of Lester. His wife Carolyn is living the American Dream. She has a good job and her career is important to her. Lester and Carolyn are only fighting and Jane suffers because of them. Later Jane finds Ricky, a neighbour the first boy that is interested in her and who gives her the feeling to be important. With him by her side she changes her personality. They like each other. Ricky is a very strange person. Mostly he is recording simple things in life. Even when Lester is dead, Ricky thinks that this situation is beautiful.Angela is Jane's best and only friend. She is a men dream because of her look. She is the opposite of Jane and is very self-confident. Her interests are boys and her looking, but at the end the viewer learns the other side of her.I think that the director wants to show us the dark side of the American Dream. It can be bad for someone to forget about real life and think only of realizing the American Dream. Both live at first the American Dream, they have everything someone can dream of, but after Lester quits his job the question turns why he does it even he had all which means the American dream is achieved. Why does he want to leave this? Only to be a young man without responsibility? Every viewer can decide himself. It is a movie with a little bit irony but with an earnst confidence. Try to get the confidence. About how the society must be and how the society really is...it's worth watching. You will not have any regrets.by L.S.The American drama ""American Beauty"", released in 1999, is about a middle-aged office worker, husband and father who suffers from a midlife crisis as he feels sexually attracted to his daughter's friend Angela. He gets involved with her after seeing her dance at a basketball game. As Lester fantasizes about Angela in a sexual way, red rose petals are a repeating and recurring motif which emphasize Lester's sexual attraction towards Angela. Meanwhile Lester's materialistic wife Carolyn, a real-estate broker, begins an affair with a business partner, their daughter Jane gets involved with Ricky, a marijuana smoking drug dealer and neighbour. Lester tries to get back being younger by working out hardly and also smoking marijuana as he overhears Angela telling Jane she would find him sexually attractive if he changed and improved his looks and physique. When Lester is about to have sex with Angela, he stops because of her being a virgin. By the time Lester discovers his wife's affair and Ricky convinces Jane to flee to New York City. In the end, Lester gets shot by Carolyn and dies.The main characters in this film are Lester (Kevin Spacey), his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) and her friend Angela (Mena Suvari). In addition Lester is shown as an easy going but loving father and also capable of being influenced, for example by Jane's friend Angela. Carolyn seems to be a materialistic and cold hearted wife, only having her ambitions and business in mind while Jane appears to be an emotional young teenager who doesn't really know what she exactly wants. Furthermore Angela apperas to be an exciting young woman who is funny and fascinating and attracted to older men like Lester.I do mostly identify with Lester's character as I guess it's possible to feel the urge wanting to be younger by working out and trying to improve your own physique as one gets older and tries to be more attractive for a young woman. I do not support him consuming marijuana, but I do support the fact that he wants to try out something new that he maybe did not experience in his younger years. Besides I do not judge Lester for having a ""crush"" on Angela as his marriage is almost torn aparty anyway and his wife is only concerned about her business. Lester's attraction to Angela also implies realistic aspects that one can still feel attracted to somebody else even though this person is married.Referring to which character I reject most, I choose Carolyn as she is a perfect example for what I declare as cold-hearted, insensitive, materialistic and only focused on business, not paying any attention to her family, instead of that even having an affair with a business partner and seriously cheating on her husband by breaking the promise of being true as she also has sex with him.The director's intention in making this film was to create a picture, a situation about a middle-aged man's life and his family and what it can turn into if one is suffering from a midlife crisis. Even more the director maybe wanted to simply allegorize possible developments in different relationships, for example the relationship between Lester and his wife or Lester and Angela and things like cheating, a marriage falling apart or murder is not that ""unusual"" and ""rare"" as people always suppose it is. These incidents actually, they are the message the director wants to transport to the viewers. One message I could think of would be ""you can never know what might happen to you"" which refers to Lester as he fell in love with a very young woman or that his marriage could ever fall apart. Actually, it doesn't relate to many films I know as there is no other movie I know that has elements of drama, melodrama and comedy included. Of course, there are different films in which several relationships fall apart, but there is no film I know that is concentrated on the midlife crisis of a middle-aged man and his trials to turn younger.It relates to US-American culture by showing a ""pretty normal"" life - at first - of an American family living in the suburbs and sharing a family life. But this film also relates to the American Pop Culture as the scenes in which red rose petals are all over Angela's body, are real and true art combined with the music creating a special atmosphere having in mind that these scenes are Lester's sexual fantasies. This film is not just a film that shows life referring to the US-American culture, it also does give the viewer a slight sense of US-American ""art-culture"" as there is no other film that is so specific and actually one-of-a-kind.I think that this film is a masterpiece which maybe doesn't appear at a masterpiece at all at first sight. It is a little bit like love at ""second sight"". The plot is amusing, entertaining and also melodramatic because of the dramatic elements this film includes. One of the film's strengths is the directing, editing and camera as one can just take the wonderful example of Lester's sexual fantasies about Angela with all the red rose petals all over her body. Different camera shots and structures emphasize specific situations that are usually not that specific. Moreover the music is one of the film's biggest strenghts as it feels like the music was produced and the texts written in a combination while the plot was written, to me it seems like film and music have finally come to be one piece. I cannot see any weaknesses in this film at all.I highly recommend this film as this film is a must-have-seen and those people who do not watch it are going to miss one of the biggest masterpieces in the filmhistory ever. This film is amusing, interesting, entertaining, exciting, sometimes even confusing, but all these characteristics make this film wonderful.by B.B.The movie American Beauty is about Lester, a family man, who has the desire to break out from the classified life. He has enough of the thankless life with a wife, who always wants to be perfect with no human feelings and a daughter who hates him.Trying to do only what he thinks is fun without considering any sort of moral obligations, Lester manages to destroy the perfect family picture in the shortest time. Getting away from routine life, only doing what he wants to do, doing sports to be desirable again, smoking a joint because feeling like it, buying a Firebird because he's always wanted one, say things that he actually means because he doesn't have to adapt to anyone...just being twenty years younger.The consequences of his midlife crisis causes unsalvageable damage but, even if too late, brings along important realization.Their daughter Jane walks in the shadow of her confident friend Angela, whose perfect facade breaks together like a house of cards in the course of the movie through inexperience and vulnerability. There isn't a single boy who shows interest for Jane, unlike Angela. Behind heavy make-up, Jane tries to hide herself and thinks that by having her breasts enlarged she can fight off her the doubts about herself.But it's the new neighbor boy who helps her find confidence in herself. Ricky is a voyeur and a criminal in one. He deals with drugs and one of his customers is Lester. He goes to the same school as Jane and he's the first boy who is interested in her. His father, Colonel Fitts, is a former soldier who tries to hide the fact that he likes men by having an aggressive opinion towards gay relationships.The main character is without any doubt Lester. After breaking out of this role, Lester's zest for life returns a new because his seemingly perfect life is anything but in his new position, Lester awakens; he's confident and happy. Lester is the first to break out of this perfect life but it doesn't take long for the other characters to follow him and show their true faces.Every protagonist is clearly and naturalistically drawn but it's Carolyn who carries the greatest responsibility and with it the heaviest burden. Her goal is always to be perfect. Through her own high pretenses she loses the natural ability to simply be human. Carolyn isn't able to show feelings in front of her daughter or her husband because showing any sort of emotions is a danger to the dominant and emotionless Carolyn. For her reputation in society and for her pursuit of material things she inhabits the role of the emotionless wife and mother but sadly she breaks out far too late.  I wouldn't turn down any of the protagonists in this movie because each role is only an end product of society's expectations.I feel sorry for each character one way or the other, be it the inexperienced Angela who pretends to have sexual experiences or Colonel Fitts, who beats his son because he assumes his son is having an affair with Lester. Colonel Fitts, who's gay himself but suppresses his urges as best he can, wants to save his son from the humiliation. In a perfect society you simply cannot be gay.Personal happiness, which makes life worth living, is being set behind the expectations of society. Therefore it is only a matter of time before the true personality dies.Everything is only a facade, seemingly normal for the outside world but not necessarily reality. The American Dream, no matter which nationality, is the reason why millions of people emigrated/still emigrate to the USA. People who wanted to achieve a lot of popularity. But do expensive homes, gardens and cars make us happy? The higher the social class, the higher the expectations.Is the daily trying to make the right society"" decision not too stressful? The intact family, is it real? Is a human being able to step out of his role, to step off the stage and take off the make-up? Despite a few amusing parts in the movie, it's a movie that criticizes society. It's a movie without a happy end. Lester's insight comes far too late but no one blames him because he's only the victim. In movies such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" the American is portrayed as the proud, honorable person who's willing to die for his country. All this is shown as a facade in this movie. The movie is most definitely convincing. The camera angle as well as the lights and sound effects were especially configured for each scene making them so much more believable.Through camera angles such as ""medium shot"", the audience has the feeling of being there in person. The protagonist doesn't have to talk for the audience to know what he's feeling, it seems so real. The ""eye level shot"" camera angle for example, the audience can watch through the perspective of a certain character, which supports the audience compassion. The music becomes louder and faster the more their lives break apart and the light fits into each emotional state of the main characters. The reason the story is so good is because it's different. Even though it might seem unrealistic at first glance, something like this could happen anywhere because society's pressure is everywhere and everyone goes through a midlife crisis at least once in his live.I would recommend this movie to everyone who's fed up with American movies that portray America to be perfect. On top of everything, the superb cast is a plus as well, added to the great script. Have fun watching!Z.Z.American Beauty is directed by S. Mendes and was a coming out in 2000. The film deals with an American middle-class family tragedy which is played by the main character Lester, his wife Carolyn Burnham and their daughter Jane. At the beginning it seems to that they achieve the American dream but everything turns into a nightmare.The Burnhams are living in a suburban city and Carolyn is employed as a real estate agent and Lester is working for a media company and their daughter Jane is attending the high school.To begin with, at the begining Lester Burnham is shown as a boring and ordinary employee until he gets a midlife crisis. All the desaster starts by seeing Jane's best friend Angela. Suddenly he feels like a teenage boy and he knows that his life is so unfulfilled and he wants to become a new and strong man to make Angela fall in love with him. Lester gets a new meaning of life, he tries to be attractive to Angela , he increasingly sees the complete life in a rather simple way, he finds a new job without responsibilty at a fast food restaurant and he buys a new car, all in all, it seems that he loses all of the old"" life and he behaves like a teenager.Furthermore, he knows that his wife Carolyn is unfaithful and betrays him with an other men, but Lester shows no interest in it. Carolyn is represented like an ordinary and bustling woman, who is eager to be sucessful. Also she is proud of their way of living, all the material things in their life make her happy, but she is unhappy in her marriage, too. Thus she cheats Lester. Carolyn means that she has reached all aims in her life, she has one child, a beautiful house and a well-paid job, but in the ending she realizes that she hasn`t established anything in her life. On the contrary Carolyn has recognized that she probably waseted her time by getting married to Lester.Jane is an American teenage girl who doesn't want to be beautiful, conceited and ordinary like her parents so she dresses herself dark and unpretty. But what is so paradox about her attitude being not marvellous is that she plays with her thought getting a breast surgery what is probably just a teenage complex. Also Jane is fighting with her dad because her father has a crush on Angela and Jane totally feels ashamed for her dad that he is able to act like that, in case of it their relationship isn`t a regular father-daughter thing. Ricky is Jane's neightbour and also her school mate who caughts her on his video cam which is the reason that that she calls him a ""pervert"" and for a while it was pretty quiet around him but after Jane is recognizing that Ricky is watching and being interested in her she kind of feels attracted to him: Jane gives up the typical yuppie life for the ""true love"" for Ricky.Ricky is in a way comparable to Jane because he isn`t the most handsome guy around the neighbourhood and probably doesn`t fulfill the typical American way of beauty also he lives a very secluded life. The reason for his behaviour is supposedly has his mother has a mental issue and lives pretty pulled back but in the contrast to Ricky`s dad who is a tyrant probably because he suspects that Ricky is dealing with drugs which would be totally against his way of military thinking and the American moral.by K.K. and N.S."	4.0	Beauty Unmasked	2010-08-23	17	3	14

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2PR6NXG0PA3KY	Giordano Bruno	"... if it weren't so very very sad. It's a film that rubs the intolerable emptiness and shame of our thwarted little lives in our faces, and then tries to wipe away our tears with a posthumous paean to the beauty we failed to appreciate while we were living. It's the hollowness of that paean that perturbs me. A millisecond of epiphany after two hours of grief! Ah. ""What does it all mean?"" Are the screenwriter and director being viciously ironic/sardonic or are we in Kansas after all, Toto?Six characters in search of an Author? Great ensemble acting, let's acknowledge immediately! Lester Burnham, our narrator, announces his death in a voice-over in the first minute of the film, and in a sense the plot becomes a ""who'll do it"", with every other character a candidate emotionally and with images of guns omnipresent. Lester is your seriously depressed 42-year-old male, who snaps. There's a hate-triangle in the Burnham household, of Lester, his frantic wife, and their 'emo' daughter. Then a second hate-triangle moves in next door, a ramrod Marine colonel, his catatonic wife, and their vampire son. Whoops, he's not a vampire, just an evolving sociopathic stoner, but this is a film that 'looks' like it should involve a vampire at some point. The Burnham daughter, a sullen Plain Jane, has a would-be Lolita best friend. That makes a septet of seven emotionally dischordant (sic) principals in a sexually a-tonal double fugue. Hey, is all that Hate really Love? The only people in the neighborhood who aren't emotionally dystonic are the two guys -- partners -- who live contentedly on the other side of the Burnham household. But the 'genius' of this film is that all these grotesque human miscreants are somehow pitifully plausible. But wow, I hope I'm not one of them!So who kills Lester? Of course I'm not going to tell! But really, the big question is 'why is Lester so happy being dead?'"	5.0	This Film Might Be Very Funny ...	2011-11-07	2	1	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AQSQLWD3NLMAS	Glenn A. Buttkus	"Director Sam Mendes is a very well known Theater director in England . He had directed actors like Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes in classical roles, working with the Royal Shakespeare Company.  He directed Nicole Kidman in THE BLUE ROOM. He won a Tony for his Broadway revival of CABARET. Considered an ""actor's director"", Steven Spielberg (Filmworks produced the film) personally recommended Mendes for the director's chair. With an ample budget, Mendes was able to rehearse his actors for two weeks before shooting started. This always tightens dialogue and deepens characterizations. He also encouraged improvisation during the shoot. BEAUTY was his feature film debut. He did his homework, and came prepared with his story boards completed, and the movie clearly in his head. He has gone on to direct other fine films including ROAD TO PERDITION (2002), and JARHEAD (2005), which turned out to be a strong anti-war film in the guise of a gung-ho actioner.  He has been called the ""new"" Kubrick by some. He is married to Kate Winslet, and they have homes in London and California .Alan Ball, who wrote the screenplay, is a noted New York playwright. He was having lunch one windy day at the World Trade Center Plaza , and he watched a paper bag frisking and floating in the breeze; giving him the inspiration to write first a play, and then a screenplay. The theatrical version has never been produced. An outspoken gay activist and practitioner, he weaved the homosexual references expertly into the fabric of the story. It was not overdone, and it was certainly not overlooked. Much of the final action of the plot hinged on homophobia and closeted eroticism.One of the most striking things about the movie was the astonishingly good cinematography by veteran cameraman Conrad L. Hall. He won an Oscar for his effort on the film. He gave us some masterful set ups that played lovingly with light and shadow, a bit reminiscent of James Wong Howe. I really noticed this by accident when I viewed the movie in black and white as a mistake of projection. The color red was the prominent motif for much of the movie--deep red roses in vases in nearly every room in the Burnham household, roses dominating the garden along the white picket fence, the only house in the neighborhood with a bright red door, a 1970 red Pontiac Firebird, and of course blood, which makes an appearance as well. In addition Lester's middle-aged fantasies and dreams about young Angela were dripping with red rose petals, bursting from her unzipped bodice, covering the ceiling as she hovered there, filling the steaming tub that she languished in while ""awaiting"" him. Secondary to a short shooting schedule several of the scenes had to be shot at night, and Hall had to light them to appear as day shots. He was very successful in this endeavor.The wonderfully pounding driving musical score was written by veteran composer Thomas Newman. Mendes was interested in unique scoring, percussion and mallet instruments -and this intriguing thwacking moved the plot along, all the while building tension and interest. Later Newman and Conrad Hall teamed up again with Mendes when they made ROAD TO PERDITION (2002).Kevin Spacey was excellent, pitch perfect, on the mark as Lester Burnham, a kind of 90's Willy Loman. Being faced with depression, discontent, unfulfilled sexual needs, and a mid-life crisis, somehow he found the presence of mind to put his world in order. To our delight he told off his dreary supervisor, told him where to shove their job, and then blackmailed the boss for a tidy sum, citing administrative misuse of funds for libation and prostitutes. He rushed away from the white collar stress, and blissfully got a job flipping burgers at Smiley's, became infatuated with his daughter's friend, Angela, began pumping iron to impress her, became a stoner buying from Ricky, the kid next door, and he purchased his fantasy car--a 1970 red Firebird. In the midst of all this bizarre behavior, he rediscovered himself, saying that he ""was tired of being treated that I don't exist.""Annette Bening as the wife, Carolyn, infused the part with a focused, mannered, manic  hectic energy, misdirecting her considerable passion toward her garden and career at the expense of her relationship with her family, and her marriage. She was a walking jabbering divorce waiting to happen. Oddly I detected a slight lisp in her dialogue that I had not noticed in her past performances; maybe it was character driven. Thora Birch, a child actress all grown up at 17 years old, played daughter Jane. Her nude scene was daring and unexpected. She underplayed and worked well with her eyes - her timing and transitions were bang on. We all have known this teenager in our lives. Chris Cooper was very intense, real, and dislikable as Col. Frank Fitts, USMC. It was not clear to me whether he was active duty or retired. In one of the earlier drafts of the screenplay, we discovered that Fitts had a gay lover that had died in Viet Nam . I am sad that bit was cut. It could have given even more depth to the Colonel; of course that depended on when it was revealed. The kiss in the rain scene was wonderfully shocking, and it certainly did not need to be deleted. Wes Bentley was mercurial, magnetic, creepy, and very self-assured as the ""strange kid"" next door, Ricky Fitts. He played him so clever that Ricky was always two jumps ahead of his parents, his teachers, and his school mates. Beyond being the new kid in school, he was extra hard to get to know. Neighbor Jane was at first creeped out by him, than she became fascinated as she learned to appreciate his intellect and sensitivity, as they became an item. Allison Janney played his put-upon wife, Barbara; her almost catatonic stillness was haunting and horrific--a woman who had chosen to shut down rather than live in a battle zone. Mena Suvari, also a child actress, was 19 years old when she shot BEAUTY. She was tantalizing and tragic as Miss Popular, Angela Hayes, who incessantly talked about sex to mantle her lack of experience and her lack of courage. Getting by all her life on her looks, nevertheless she had no real self-confidence. She wanted to be a teen model, but one got the feeling that she lacked the drive to make it happen. She was 19 years old when she filmed BEAUTY.I loved the film, and have enjoyed repeated viewings. It is a very dark comedy that became a drama as it played out. The tragedy was connected to the humor, and yet I continuously hoped that Lester will be spared; and he never was. It is like I feel each time I watch WEST SIDE STORY (1961), hoping that Tony will not be shot during the next viewing, or that Kirk Douglas will make it out of SPARTACUS without being crucified.  Thank God the director edited out the original ending where Jane and Ricky were brought to trial and then jailed for Lester's murder, as the Colonel's wife destroyed the bloody t-shirt."	5.0	Heart Rot	2007-11-26	12	11	1

It contains the everyday, ordinary career Jones, the right wing family, the conservative gay couple, the frigid female, youth in three distinct varieties. All of the characters &quot;could&quot; exist, alone perhaps, but the combination here is obviously surreal, barely believeable, but somehow perfectly palatable. Together they symbolically express America's current state of travail, from the breakdown of the family to the criminalization of marijuana to the dread, morbid fear that it is not just them, but us too, who are &quot;ordinary&quot;.I loved this film, it was always implying devastatingly useful insights -- but gently, so that one was more likely to draw from it friendly insights that agree with one's point of view. It combines outlooks from both sides of the political spectrum, and somehow I fear it might be difficult for conservatives to swallow. I think Spacey's &quot;Pay it Forward&quot; was much more simplistic -- maybe he was afraid that he confused us too much with &quot;American Beauty&quot; and wanted to backpedal a bit. I certainly hope we were not confused by American Beauty. This isn't a movie just for us ethical philosophers, liberals, and recreational drug users. I think every American should watch it and draw their own conclusions.On a final note, the sound track was excellent, the theme music haunting yet friendly.

Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening stand out as your upper-class  average family with its flaws and errs. The haunting symbolism of a rose,  petals, fantasy dreams of a life that has all the desires and wants of most  anybody, all these combine to create a visual message to the audience that  people live a masked life out in the open, whereas behind closed doors the  shattering realism and moral decadence of the so-called average family is  played out mercilessly. The comedic elements enlighten what could easily be  assumed to be a gallery of depression and melancholy. It shows that people  today can only find true beauty in what they enjoy doing no matter who or  what it hurts and what morals they are tearing apart. It is truthful and  honest that today people do what they have to to be happy. The humor is at  times laugh out loud and hilarious.  Don't miss the great  performances. It has an extremely unique opening and closing that so few  films ever dare to achieve with chilling effectiveness. The score by Thomas  Newman beckons the horrid reality of what America has become in this  generation and what the family of today suffers in the breakdown process  while it is hidden under a false lifestyle to the outer world. At times it  is eerie and frightening and at others lighthearted.  Brilliant on  every level. Those with a mature and open mind will understand it while  those who don't have good sense will make a mockery of it.	5.0	One of the best of the year	2000-01-22	13	11	2

It`s not that challenging, either, since ""Fight Club"" did this kind of stuff much better, and earlier. Not to say it`s bad, since there are some good elements to find here. The direction by Sam Mendes was creative enough but not stellar. The acting was appropriate although some characters seemed like caricatures straight out of ""Daria"". The plot, a bit unbalanced and sometimes went over the top. Ok, it`s a dark comedy but that ending is neither dark nor comic and just doesn`t fit with the rest of the story.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1N40I9TO33VDU	Grant A Thompson	Everything is not what it seems--right? Well, surely there are some exceptions. Comfortable middleclass white Anglo-Saxon Protestant suburban America, for instance. Well, let's zoom in on this nice representative street and test that hypothesis. Eddie Murphy and Wesley Snipes do not live in this neighbourhood. Their kids do not go to school with these kids. Surely, noone here is in Bruce Willis's Color Of Night psycho self-help group. Squad cars do not patrol this street. They and all other nasties and challenges to normalcy are out of sight beyond an invisible hermetic barrier.Sure enough, as we zoom in for a closer look, here is a nice normal couple, Lester and Carolyn Burnham (Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening). Lester is in advertising, and in mid-life crisis. Carolyn is a real estate agent dedicated to living by appearances, playing self-improvement tapes in the car, and swapping lifestyle and gardening tips with the homosexual couple next door. We know Lester and Carolyn once had sex, because they have an only child, Jane (Thora Birch). She hates her weird parents and wants only to live in a normal healthy environment like the Addams Family, or a remake of The Exorcist -- when she is not hanging out with her geek-next-door boyfriend.Meanwhile, the conjugally challenged, burnt-out Lester has the hots for his daughter's Lolita-esque best friend (Mena Suvari). Fantasies about her embellish his day.The climax of the film is a real surprise (which I won't spoil here). It occurs, ironically, at the moment of Lester's achievement of a level of serene enlightenment such as may be sought through lifetimes of effort by Hindu mystics.American Beauty is a very fine film of a script with quirky social insights, and first-rate acting, in a high quality DVD release.	5.0	Beauty is not what it seems: look closer	2002-08-17	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2AYFZY1KOLB1B	Greg	"I'm responding to the reviewer ""Father Knows Best"", who went on the usual neo-conservative ""anti-PC"" rant. First of all, existentialism is by no means the same as Nazism, is not neccessarily godless, and in fact was not the brainchild of Heidegger. Existentialist philosophy was espoused by a broad range of thinkers: Kirkegaarde, Sartre, Camus (who was in fact an instrumental part of the anti-Nazi Resistance, get the cliched anti-French puns out of the way now). American Beauty is not trying to promote any agenda, it is merely an attempt to reveal that suburbia's tranquility is often a front for the same kind of savagery and alienation experienced elsewhere. As for Nazism's persecution of homosexuals, that is a documented fact. Roehm may have been a homosexual, however many of Hitler's other underlings did not conform with his image of a master race. Hitler himself was not a blue-eyed, blond-haired ""Aryan,"" it is not suprising that he tolerated other ""imperfections"" in his lieutenants. Denying persecution of homosexuals in the Nazi era is equivalent to those fanatics who deny the very existence of the Holocaust. Condemnation of homophobia, as depicted in American Beauty, seems to me to be nothing to be ashamed of. The homophobic military officer being a closet homosexual is not slander on the US military, but an example of something known as irony. As for educated people such as Ball and Mendes not having a basic knowledge of existentialism, one of the most influential worldviews of the century, that is just absurd. Legitimate criticism of the film-making in American Beauty, though I enjoyed it, would be appreciated, but let's keep the hackneyed Rush Limbaugh rants to ourselves, please.

And hard-core artsy types don't care  for it because it's not nearly audacious ENOUGH. But most viewers, I  suspect, will find an intelligently paced, very well acted and beautifully  shot film that they will not quickly forget.  Kevin Spacey and Annette  Bening got the Oscar nods, but the younger actors, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley  and Mena Suvari were all spot on.  And Chris Cooper and Peter Gallagher  turned in remarkable performances as well.  I won't say it's a perfect  movie, but it is a film of genuine substance--the kind that lends itself to  multiple interpretations and multiple viewings.	4.0	Stays with you...	2000-08-08	2	1	1

But I would have to go with Chris Cooper, as the cold father of Kevin Spacey's neighbor/drug  dealer/daughter's love interest. He stole a lot of scenes, and it is sad  that he wasn't nominated for the Oscar. But seriously, this movie is very  well done in every sense. Listen to the praise, because this movie deserves  it! It is at once funny and touching, sad and yet heartwarming. See this  movie!	5.0	Movie perfection	2000-02-20	3	2	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A9YTARTKZRXL	"""greysky"""	It is really very hard hard to explain simply what makes American Beauty so brilliant- what it has that so many other movies lack. This is probably because of the strange plot of the movie, one that could almost hurt it's  reviews. Almost.You see, in this satirical portrayal of a suburban  family rebelling against the constraints imposed on them by society and by  themselves, things are not always what they seem. A man who's barely there  is about to have a sudden surge in spirit, and will begin to persue his  daughter's best friend, who has become his sexual obsession. A new neighbor  boy, who sells drugs part time and is obsessed with moviemaking and beauty  will change the life of a very lonely, very dissatisfied young girl. A wife  who cheats on her husband will be driven to the edge, to the breaking  point, when she becomes murderous.And in American Beauty, it all fits  together.The true power in this movie comes from the characters  themselves- upon closer inspection they are all deeper and more complex  than they seem, something that is backed up by the great acting. The plot  flows along nicely as you discover more and more about the characters, and  in the end, there aren't really any good guys or bad guys (except for one  character, who is utterly distraught)- it's like the Chinese Yin and Yang.  A little bad in good- a little good in bad.This is a movie that succeeds  on many levels; while it is incredibly mundane and realistic, it is  beautiful and vast in scope. It can be watched over and over, and each  viewing provides new insight not caught before.I would suggest that if  you are over 17 you see this movie. It is definitely too inappropriate in  content for young or immature people, but for mature people who want to see  a definite masterpiece that will not soon be forgotten, American Beauty is  definitely the movie to see.	5.0	American Beauty Deceptively Brilliant	2000-06-12	8	5	3

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A25FDX17O3QKLT	Hallstatt Prince	"The movie begins in an ominous way  with the video taping of girl who is asks  a friend to kill her father. Not meaning to be a spoiler but we are being set up by this scene.The next scene we see, the actual beginning of the movie, is an aerial shot of a tree lined street as Kevin Spacey begins to narrate the story. He tells us  that  he is  42  and ""in less than a year he will be dead""The introductory narration is  done in somewhat of a funny sarcastic deadpan.Lester Burnham (played by Spacey) lives in a nice neighborhood  and is  married to his  wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) who trys to keep a picture perfect house that would make Martha Stewart proud.Lester bemoans  his joyless life but as  Lester says in his narration before the story begins it is never too late to make a change.We  learn Lester is stuck at a job he hates and we see him spending his days on the phone dealing with clients.His wife  is a driven woman who puts on a false front.  Lester and Carolyn are obviously following two different paths although both are going through a middle age crisis. Most of the adults in this movie are portrayed as living lives that are lies.They have a teenage daughter, Jane, going through her own painful transition in her life.Camera work, music and editing come together to humorously highlight the absurdity of the  life style Carolyn has made for her family and with which Lester until recently has gone along.New neighbors move in next door to the Burnhams who will play an important role in their lives. The new family is run by a tyrannical military man.But  as the story proceeds three  new characters come into their lives: for Annette Bening it is ""The Real Estate King"", for their daughter it is the boy who moves in next door and for Lester it is his daughter's best friend.Three  events precipitate what comes to follow: the arrival of the new neighbors, a cheerleading performance at a basket ball game and a party for real estate agents.The Burnhams travel to the basket ball game to see their daughter perform and their Lester becomes smitten with  his daughter's best friend and so he begins an obsession with this Lolita.At a party for real estate agents Carolyn puts does he best  to be the picture of confidence (Bening is quite  brilliant as her performance of the confident real estate agent which borders on the surreal and absurd) and does her best to schmooze and  to cozy up to ""The Real Estate King"". Lester who is bored out of his wits at the party meets Ricky Fitz, the boy next door. Ricky's  is a waiter at the party but the job is really just a cover for his very profitable business as a marijuana dealer. Lester and Ricky step out back where  Lester is reintroduced to pot.Later we find  Ricky has a fascination with the Burnham's daughter something she learns when she discovers him surreptitiously filming her.Other than Lester, Ricky is the most pivotal character in the story. He is constantly beaten by his father, did a stint in military school and after  nearly beating a fellow  student to death spends time in a mental hospital. Through it all the suffering he has gone though  he find himself on a  spiritual journey seeing the world as being overwhelmingly beautiful and is now wise beyond his years.  His hobby is video taping everything he sees especially the beauty of the world. Included in the beautiful things that fascinate him are the  eyes of a homeless man who had just died. To paraphrase Ricky says he  could see  God  looking back at him through the eyes of the dead man. There is a beautiful sequence where  Ricky shows  Jane one of his favorite tapes - a bag  dancing in the wind. Despite his criminal profession Ricky can be seen as a young holy man. Also  he seems to symbolize the movie's creators themselves as his fascination with the lens and Ricky's can be seen as being one and the same.Things progress quickly. Carolyn  continues with her quest for the good life and ends up having and affair with the ""Real Estate King"" whereas Lester quits his job and blackmails his boss into giving him a large severance package and  starts working at a fast food restaurant. There is definite a clash of paths, of values and cultures between Lester and his wife.Lester buys himself the car of his boyhood dreams, listens to the music of his youth, smokes pot and lifts weights. He also continues  his obsession with his daughters' friend until finally the two of them come together. (during this important sequence we are treated to Neil Young's poignant ""Don't Let it Bring You Down""  sung softly in the background).  She offers herself to him willingly  but  Lester  refuses and in that instant things seem to come together for Lester both realizing  his responsibility as an adult and his love for his family. It is a type of epiphany for Lester.Immediately there after Lester has his brains blown out. To tell you the name of the assailant would take away the surprise.But the fact that  the lovable Spacey character is now dead is portrayed as a joyous thing and his narration that concludes the movie which sums up his life in a very moving, joyous and hopeful. And in the end everyone seems to experience a type of salvation.Some of the movie is  social satire  but the overwhelming  message of the movie is the holiness and mystical nature of life and the idea that life and death are on a continuum -  very much in tune with poets such as William Blake, Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg.A wonderful choice of music accentuates the mystical feeling of the movie including the main score which is made up of percussion instruments and that has a somewhat oriental feel to it.So what does the title refer to? Does it refer to the roses Carolyn tends  or the  Lolita  Lester pursues? I think it is neither. America Beauty for this reviewer seems to refer to  American life. Although is may be materialistic and filled with disappointments has a holiness to it.Highly recommended"	5.0	Middle aged crisis and the mystical nature of life	2005-06-12	9	6	3

Just finished giving it my second watch.My first watch made this the best movie I had seen till that date.My second watch taught me there are two types of emotions attached to tears. I cried out of the third though.Thomas Newman's famous Plastic Bag Theme that plays its current of absolute enigmatic melody througout the film only adds to the overburdening significance of What I saw in this film.There are six main characters in this film. There are scenes when my brain waved an invisible white flag to what it saw.Chris Cooper (Ricky's dad) has done many movies before. I quite enjoyed the absolute rigidity of his character. Kevin Spacey is just so befitting in this ordinary man's role of his that I would think twice before doubting his contribution to the whole plot.The numer of times in this film that I felt this overwhelmed recreated feeling of absolute bliss is quite absurd.Its alarming how absolutely flawless and perfect this movie stands.Note:If you have not seen this film , I don't believe your wasting your time reading this review of mine. I'm just a small chain to the process.There are some movies I feel that have impacting climaxes and some with solid concluding 20 mins.For American Beauty, the last two hours of the movie were the best.I bow my head in salute to the makers of this movie.American Beauty is not a movie.Its the most soul binding 120 mins ever displayed on screen.The movie pushes itself into a genre beyond our lives.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AST100CTZLNYW	"Harry Carr ""carrliadiere"""	I simply fail to understand how people can slate this movie. To me, any rating that is less than four is a total injustice, and, for want of a better word - wrong.For this is a beautiful film. And a masterpiece of filmmaking. Mendes takes some of the strongest, and in many ways disturbing scenes in the film, such as Thora Birch's character removing her top for her boyfriend, across the street, then clashes it with shocking and sudden violence, from the boyfriends father. It shocks - it brings you back to sick reality. And yet, Mendes never pauses on the individual emotions for too long - it never becomes unbearable. In a film with so many socially awkward moments, it would be easy for it to be cringeworthy, but it is executed so perfectly that the impact is delivered sans the guilt. This in itself is genious work from Mendes.The story boldy cracks along, developed in a slightly Pulp Fiction-esque way (inter-twining plots). The music is divine, and implemented brilliantly. The message is delivered in a suitably oblique way, so that the viewer needs to think about it, but also gets a direct message fed to him. It works in all the right areas. You watch in a state of overwhelming consciousness, of yourself, and of your life. For me, it's as close to life changing as a movie is ever going to come.I feel I must address the various poundings the film has received here, though. It is saddening that nudity is used as an excuse to give the film a bad rating, seeming to suggest that female nudity is either wrong or bad. I didnt see one complaint about male nudity, maybe that's due to the vagaries of reviewer demographics, but it seems that some moral attribute is amiss here (one of the very issues the film tries to tackle). Suvari is seen topless because she is being undressed. In real life, there would be no convenient blanket to cover her up in such a situation. And get over yourself, it's a minor feature of the movie. 'Curse words' (which obviously affect the story SO much) are also a poor reason to criticise a movie. Also, as a person who dislikes cursing anyway, this movie didnt shock or annoy me in that respect.It seemed real, maybe too real. And maybe that's what people need to get over, the fact that the movie is highly real, and real in a way that can shock and impress. There's a message here that is so deep, it belongs more in the books of Plato or Socrates.So, I beg you, watch it. Be entertained, laugh, cry - be moved.	5.0	Beauty	2001-12-09	5	2	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2YM2NM7YZA24Q	Haseeb	I typed up a review over a week ago and it never got posted, why is that?  Anyway, I'll try again so here goes.American Beauty is perhaps one of the best films I've ever seen.  The main theme of the movie was beauty and how a seemingly typical surburban family went about looking for it in the wrong way.  Kevin Spacey's monologue at the end of the picture along with the part with the plastic bag blowing in the wind is a playing out of the statements: &quot;there is beauty in simplicity&quot; - unknown. &quot;matters of great concern should be taken lightly and matters of little concern should be taken seriously&quot; - Hagakure Book of the Samurai.  In other words, beauty is not how much money you have in your wallet, what kind of car you drive, getting high, and a good-looking high school girl.  Beauty is all around us in seemingly mundane things from a plastic bag blowing in the wind to the clouds in the sky.I think that the people who will reflect on this film and act on it's message are not your typical suburbanites, but people who are already living fairly humble lives.  This is unfortuate, but most people are too caught up in materialism, sex and drugs to take a movie like this all that seriously.  I have to say that people who didn't like this film or just considered it &quot;OK&quot; are very superficial people.	5.0	what happend to my review?	2000-11-27	7	4	3

An intelligent, suspenseful, funny, charming, and intensely significant character driven movie, American Beauty shines.  Its poignant and accurate portrayal of all the facets of suburbia in an American microcosm, the film explores self-knowledge and the transformation of self as well as smoking pot at 40.  American Beauty is Sam Mendes' masterpiece.  I would love to single out Kevin Spacey's absolutely masterful performance, but the truth is that every character deserved an Oscar.  It should be required for every American to see this movie.  Particularly as a teen, the portrayal of what it means to come of age (and back again) is brilliant.  The power of the movie lies in its ability to take countless themes and ideas and piece them together as one.  You will never think about your life in the same way again.	5.0	The future of film	2000-11-19	1	1	0

The main women in the film are shown to the extreme ends of feminity and beauty.  Caroline, Jane, and Angela all have different aspects they bring to the film and each one symbolizes the true nature of women in the world outside of film.Caroline is a housewife trying to make a name for herself in the world of real estate.  She is the modern American woman trying to play the role of the mother, wife, business person, and typical woman in society.  However, she seems to be on her way to failure for all of them.  Caroline is an over achiever and it tears her apart that she is not perfect.  Her daughter Jane, however, prefers to exhibit almost no feminine qualities.  Caroline sees Jane as trying to be the opposite of herself.  She even asks, at one point in the movie, if Jane is trying to be unattractive.Angela is Jane's best friend.  She is the typical beauty with blue eyes, blond hair, and a thin body.  Yet Angela is extremely unhappy and seeks the attention of everyone she comes a crossed.Jane is the one that becomes the true Beauty in this film, though she does not dress or act the part.  Her Beauty comes from being surveyed by the next door neighbor, Ricky.  Though his eyes, we come to see the beauty in Jane, and the ugliness in Angela and Caroline.The lesson learned here, is that one does not have to be perfect or thin or successful to be beautiful.  One simply has to be seen.  If only the outside world would come to such an epiphany.	4.0	Representation of women in film (Germ 241Final Review)	2004-05-11	4	1	3

You can identify with some of the characters in the movie and although it is dark and sad, it has a moral to the story and the ending was just amazingly done. Even though your sad for the main character, you still realize that his life had finished in a weirdly positive way. Hence the smile at the end. I highly recommend this movie. It should be in everyone's DVD collection and is one of those movies you can watch over and over again without getting bored. And it is not entirely always dark. There is comedy woven into the movie as well. Again, one of the best Kevin Spacey movies ever.	5.0	Absolutely Amazing	2008-11-18	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3SF31L7BXDAQI	Heather Knight	American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes, is a film about a white, suburbia middle class family and the different ways that each character perceives beauty to be.Lester who is the protagonist of the film, is characterized as a middle-aged white male. His wife, Carolyn is a realtor, who is more interested in material things of life and obsessed with pruning roses, rather than having a normal relationship with her husband, whom she looks down upon. His daughter Jane is a young high school girl who feels insecure, and lacks self-esteem, which cause her to frown upon herself.Jane's next-door neighbor, Ricky is used as a tool by Mendes to show us the beauty of everything in the movie through the lens of his camera. Ricky is the surveyor for the most part in this film because he is able to see things and people beyond just their outer surfaces. Ricky thinks that Jane is more beautiful than her best friend Angela, because he feels that beauty is not something that is artificial and is materialized on the outside, but that it is something much deeper than that.This film also makes obvious to us that there are stereotypes present in this film, which are the stereotypical housewife of Ricky's mom, Barbara. Barbara is the kind of wife who will stay home and cook dinners, make you loads of breakfast in the morning, and do anything to make you happy. She seems somewhat repressed and in her own little world, this is probably because of her submission to her domineering husband. Due to this, we might think that she actually isn't in her real state of mind and don't know if this is really her personality.Angela is thought to be a sexual icon in this film. She is the blond hair and blue eyes, picture perfect woman in this movie. She is afraid of people thinking that she is ordinary and dreams of becoming a model. Angela is being surveyed throughout the whole film and knows it, and so she becomes an object of society and what they want her to be. She doesn't mind being viewed, in fact she is very conceded.	5.0	American Beauty (Review for Germ241F @ SUNY  Binghamton)	2004-05-11	3	3	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AR3WXNIYKWMX4	heffalump	"Over the years, I have had many favourite films, usually based around either stunning visuals (Blade Runner) or incredible scripts (The Godfather). But the first time I saw American Beauty with my wife, I was instantly in awe of a film that has been my benchmark ever since.To me, Alan Ball has written the perfect script. Beautifully structured, original, and with characters that are both fantastic and incredibly believable at the same time. The film is about finding beauty in the everyday. The brilliantly realised character of Ricky Fitts is the tool with which Ball gets this concept across to the audience, with his obsession of videotaping the miost mndane of subjects in a belief that they are truly beautiful. But the most beautiful part of the film is the portrayal of Lester Burnham - my new hero. Lester is a very frank and honest portrayal of a man - flaws and all. Ball does not shy away from even those embarrassing fantasies and weaknesses that all men would rather were not discussed or presented to a wider audience, (for example, Lester's sexual obsession with the teenage Angela). What Ball does, is make Lester beautiful for who he is, not what a Hollywood machine would normally have us see him as.As Lester accepts who he truly is, warts and all, he is able to transform into a person at peace with himself. The power in this transformation is tangible and incredible. Probably my favourite moment of the entire film (in a film filled with great moments) is the simple look on Lester's face when he is asked ""How are you?"" and his realisation that he is in fact ""Great. I'm great. Thankyou.""Beyond the incredible script, of course, is the impressive directorial debut of Sam Mendes. Sam makes this film visually stunning to watch. Scenes such as Ricky's description of the floating plastic bag and his video of the event that he believes is beautiful would have failed miserably if Sam had not been able to create such a beautiful moment himself with that bag.If you do watch the dvd, please take the time to listen to the commentary track. Mendes and Ball are fantastic and perform probably one of the best commentaries I've heard, both entertaining and informative at the same time.I have lost count of how many times I have watched this film. Yet it rewards my attention every single time. Beyong the script, it is a beauty to watch. The sondtrack carries you through effortlessly. The photography is extraordinary. The performances unmatchable (watch Chris Cooper too - he is incredible in this).American Beauty is an experience that everyone should try."	5.0	Perfection	2004-10-29	10	7	3

As much as I enjoy movies like this one, in my mind, I'm secretly wishing for them to just hurry up and cut to the chase.  This movie was recommended to me, however, by someone who makes my attention deficit disorder look like I could sit and read War and Peace, so I gave it a shot.What did I think of this movie... Let's see...  It as incredibly unpredictable, which is such a rare treat these days, it is definately NOT the poop from the same dog wrapped up in different paper as most movies are lately, it provides just the perfect blend of ingredients to give the viewer a taste of our main character's state of mind, it's real but quite surreal, it makes a slough of social statements most subtly, which I am quite impressed with.DESPITE the grumpings of all those who think they know better and have a great deal more knowledge of films, or background or whatever it is that qualifies them to tell me what I should and should not like, this movie is STILL GOOD.  This is coming from someone like myself, who us drawn to shallow, light movies because I can't sit still for very long. If *I* sat through it, and watched it, and wasn't counting ceiling tiles or making a running commentary, and this movie was able to hold the attention of a complete 30 year old child, it was EXCELLENT.  It was poignant, beautiful, artful, filled to the brim with talent and worth every grain of its salt.Watch it.

I did not say one  word for almost an hour after it ended...I felt that anything I could say  would be inadequate to express how I felt.  And indeed, that remains true  today, even after seeing it a half a dozen times.Art's job is to change  the way we see things, to speak to our deepest selves, and move us.  AB is  art.I have no complaint, I can list no flaw.  This film is, in my view,  utter perfection.And by the way... to all the reviewers, both negative  and positive... I don't feel that this movie was really so much about  &quot;the dark underbelly of American suburbia&quot; - that was just the  frame work.  This movie was all about, in the end, what Lester Burnham  says: being grateful for &quot;every moment of my miserable little life.  You may not understand now...but you will.&quot;  The moment when I knew  that this film was going to be something way, way beyond just an  entertaining film was when Ricky shows her the video of the plastic bag...  that was one of the most amazing moments in American cinema.And this  film has become a de facto litmus test for my friendships: fortunately,  everyone I love &quot;got&quot; it... bigtime.	5.0	Astonishingly brilliant	2000-06-28	11	8	3

Kevin Spacey delivers some very funny moments and the music in the movie is good but the movie itself isn't good at all. First of all, it's nothing about beauty. So don't expect this movie to be beautiful. It's disturbing and grotesque. I'm sure that everyone probably agrees with me that there is normally a protagonist in movies. Well, not here. There are no heroes but only perverted and strange people.There's the frustrated dad who doesn't get any sex from his wife and whose daughter hates him. He only is freed from his problems with his family when he falls in love with his daughter's best friend. I know, that's disgusting. So now, he's working out, blackmails his boss, smokes pot and does whatever he wants. No hero there.The girl that he falls in love with is obssessed with sex and finds herself to be ""not oridinary"" and beautiful. She's very dirty and isn't a hero.Then, there's his wife, the realtor who likes material possessions and cheats on him and doesn't seem to care. She calls herself a victim, and may I ask: ""of what?"" You're rich, you have a family, how the hell are you victim? And then she even considers killing her husband because she's a victim. And she doesn't even know that he is fantasizing about someone. Wow. No hero there.Then there's their daughter who hates both of them, especially her dad. For what reason? I don't know! She even jokes about wanting to kill him. That's not a very pleasant joke! She wants breast implants even though she has large enough ones. (She flashes her boyfriend). No hero there.Then, there's the daughter's boyfriend. He's a psycho who films everything and sells pot secretely. When you're supposed to like him, it's hard to.Then there's the boyfriend's dad who is a veteran army lieutenant. He's abusive and very violent and mean. And he has some skeletons in his closet. No hero there either.See, the movie was hard to watch because you don't like any of the characters in the movie. It was depressing to see our society shown as it is and without any character that you like, well...The movie had too many sex references and also had lots of uneccessary and weird stuff. Like when Kevin Spacey's character fantacizes, WEIRD!The worse for me though is that I had lots of high expectations for this movie and it ended out being nothing spectacular, just a mediocre and not memorable movie. The acting is good as are some jokes, but it really isn't what everyone says it is. It's not original and is very strange. There were also many random scenes in it and well...I don't even recommend it for a rent unless you want to see what the fuss is all about but the academy must have different opinions than me because this movie didn't deserve best picture. I enjoyed Kevin Spacey as usual in a very strong performance but the movie wasn't strong or interesting. It was about a man breaking free thanks to an 18 year old girl that he falls for but unfortunately the movie didn't do what I thought that it would.Buddy Kane: ""Who's the king?""Me: ""Definitely not Sam Mendes!!!!!"""	2.0	Best Picture?

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ABFJYHVD8RHLE	Hillary	"Kevin Spacey gives a wonderfully sympathetic performance as struggling loser, Lester Burnham. The movie opens interestingly at the end, looking back on how things came to be. This is in a similar 20/20 hindsight fashion, to the way Al Pacino narrates from the future in Brian DePalmas ""Carlito's Way"". Also similarly, the plot is not ruined by this odd chronology.Lester is an everyday average, albeit underachieving husband, scorned and rediculed by wife Carolyn, played by a disatisfied, shrill and ""joyless"" Annette Bening. Carolyn sells real estate, and wonders why her husband isn't more successful. The unhappy couple has one unhappy daughter named Jane, played by a beautifully sullen and distant Thora Birch. From the outset, we can see the gap between parent and child, that cannot be bridged.Poor Lester, nobody has an ounce of respect for him. The best part about it is, Spacey's Lester couldn't care less, and pulls no punches in making his attitude clear.  He takes great pride in humiliating wife Carolyn at a real estate party where she is trying to impress a town real estate king, played by the eyebrow king  himself, the tweezer challenged Peter Gallagher.  Carolyn becomes smitten with the mogul and begins a clandestine and tawdry affair where she has to scream ""You're The King"", during each of their encounters.  Truly a comic highpoint in the film.  Also humorous is the spaced-out Spacey, smoking pot with his newly aquainted neighbor Ricky, oustide the party.  Lester can't stop giggling, as Carolyn drags him from the back alley.Speaking of which, newcomer Wes Bentley is eerily sedate as Ricky, the drug dealing neighbor, who is fascinated with Birch's Jane, and secretly video-tapes her. Jane thinks he's a weirdo, especially when disapproving Angela (Mena Suvari) deems him so.There is Ricky's homophobe father, who is obsessive, abusive and dangerous. He forces his son to submit to urine drug tests, and beats Ricky nearly to death after finding his Nazi paraphenalia disturbed in the family china cabinet. Ricky's seemingly catatonic schizophrenic mom, is by contrast, completely oblivious to everything. We are left to wonder if her husband is the cause of her quiet derangement.This is a strange, comic tragedy that is difficult to summarize. While many of the elements are familiar, they must be absorbed and pieced together by you as you watch, and watch it you SHOULD. ""American Beauty"" is a fascinating look at the collapse of a seemingly average family, with a theme that all of us can understand, and sometimes relate to, with a message that many of us could benefit from."	5.0	Dysfunctional Beauty...	2002-06-25	2	1	1

Usually they are condescending, politically-motivated hit pieces.  Think: ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" or ""Pleasantville"" or the well-known ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.""Every now and then, however, along comes a movie that is so well done, so clever, and so well acted and directed that even though you know what it's doing to you, it does it so well that you have to give it its props.  American Beauty is such a movie.  I have watched this movie from start to finish at least 10 times and own the DVD, and I still can't figure out how Sam Mendes and Alan Ball were was able to take the cliches of dead-end jobs, desperate housewives, superficial teenagers, alienated children, closeted military men and pseudo-philosophical drug-dealers and turn them into something entertaining to the point of profound.

Rapture images as the famous roses bed and the face of the teenager Angela Hayes (Mena Suwari) who plays the role of femme fatale , superb performance of Anette Bening and above all , the development of the secondary drama of the troubled officer , makes this film as the best dramatic film in many years ; and that means a great hope for those film makers who seem think that the special effects are fundamental in every film.And this film is the best proof to deny that false premise!	5.0	In the great tradition of the authentic artistic films	2004-06-16	7	2	5

The notion that middle-aged folks in the suburbs can't see how unhappy they are has been  re-hashed by Hollywood so many times this movie hardly registers as  original.

The only character who deserves any sympathy is Lester's daughter,  who thanks to years of neglect is so starved for attention of any kind she  becomes involved with the drug-dealing death-obessesed boy next door.What saves the vanilla screenplay is the fantastic acting and directing.  Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning turn out terrific performances. The  supporting cast is top-notch. The director keeps the movie interesting and  watchable but ultimately can't hide what it really is at it's core:  Hollywood's inability to understand the common man.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3KAXXQTTXBIOF	"H. Talat Halman ""H. Talat Halman"""	"*American Beauty* follows the lives of characters each looking for what they consider authenticity in their lives. Each character seeks a real life by in his or her own way by questing for beauty. *American Beauty,* explores ways that a group of people behold each other at a distance and how in eventually coming closer, they lose that once driving force of an objectifying sense of beauty and gain a more real relationship. While at a distance they engage in objectifying each other, up-close they face their true honest intersubjectivity--an I-and-Thou relationship. It is interesting to watch the film's trailer (which you can do on Amazon Instant Video), because the trailer repeatedly flashes the message, ""Look closer."" The beauty that from a distance is exaggerated and therefore extraordinary, becomes when lived close up at the same time ordinary but more meaningful and more real. The film plays with this question about these two kinds of beauty in a number of ways.In *American Beauty,* protagonist and narrator Lester Burnham invites into his own life review. And we are left with the question of having looked closer did he find beauty. The film seems to play with the idea of idealized objectified beauty fading in the presence of honest up-close beauty with its complexities. The film's title is almost ironic: the ""America"" of *American Beauty* is suburbia; the ""beauty"" of *American Beauty* is the fantasy of love at a distance. But when the superficial shell of American suburbia breaks, true beauty is revealed.I see this film as presenting beauty as if it might be an inalienable right, as if one might say ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of...beauty."" But what of happiness? None of the characters in the movie seem happy, except maybe in the way Lester does in that he is the only ""free"" character in the film, the only character who answers to no higher authority than himself. Beauty for most of the characters in this film is their experience of spirituality and liberation from the ordinary rounds of life.In all the film's characters' quests each only fulfill themselves after he or she fails to get what they think they want. Lester in a sense renounces the world. He quits his job at a media magazine and pursues weightlifting. One night at the dinner table he exposes the banality of the suburban life his wife strives to maintain. Lester embarks on a weight-lifting program because the teenage girl to whom he is sexually attracted, a friend of his daughter Jane named Angela--a girl who boasts of her many acts of sexual promiscuity--comments to Jane that she would like to see Lester naked and Lester overhears this. But in the end Lester finds that he really does not want what he dreams of. Lester gives up being a ""luster.""Each of the characters sees beauty from a distance and when they come close to the object of their beauty it becomes elusive. Finally Lester's nobility of restraint becomes his beauty. Beauty emerges here when everyone lets go of their pretenses. Nonetheless Lester had experienced the beauty of the young Angela and that beauty drove his quest. Teenage next-door neighbor Ricky, a classmate of Jane and Angela, finds and speaks of a beauty so intense that he could almost burst but, he pursues beauty through the lens of his video camera. Just as Lester is looking and listening into Angela's life, so too is Ricky looking into Jane's life by videotaping her as often as possible.In a sense *American Beauty* is a tragedy in that no one gets what they want, and for those who do, they find it unrewarding and disappointing. Although as many reviewers complained, the characters lack depth, the question of their pursuits and quests invites us to contemplate how and where we each find beauty in our own lives. *American Beauty* raises the questions of what is a life beautifully lived and where and how do we find beauty when we look closer. What is beauty when we ""look closer?""(As an addendum to this review I wish to mention that I am intrigued that at 1:23 the soundtrack samples the Who's ""Seeker."" At one level this of course identifies Lester as a ""seeker."" But also noticed that the trailer samples the Who's ""Baba O'Reilly."" And the film's credits give ""Special thanks to Pete Townshend,"" who is of course, the guitarist and songwriter for the Who. What intrigues me is that as many of the famous songs of the Who touch on Avatar Meher Baba, I am led to wonder about this connection between director Alan Ball's intentions and the spiritual messages of Pete Townshend's music.)"	4.0	Quest for Self Discovery & Self Transcendence	2013-09-14	0	0	0

True, the talented actors did well in their roles, the cameraman was undoubtedly a genius of his profession, and the author of the plot was both  witty and imaginative. The only real problem with this film is the script.  For instance, the conversations between Wes Bentley and Thora Birch--while  necessary to the plot--are stretched to the point where one is sitting  impatiently, waiting for the end of the scene.  The dialogue is, more than  anything else, predictable.  That is really the worst part of this good  film, the fact that one can see the lines coming several minutes ahead.  However, having noted that exception, one must note that compared to the  other films of recent years that have been hyped as the &quot;Best Film of  199-!&quot;, (such as the latest &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Jerry  Maguire&quot;, or &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;), &quot;American  Beauty&quot; undoubtely stands out as an intelligent film that actually  succeeds in making the viewer take a new and close look at the calm life to  which all of us have become so accustomed.	4.0	Good, but not great.	2000-07-12	8	5	3

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A192KEPM0HW6AC	"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e..."	"""American Beauty"" opens and closes with Kevin Spacey's narration from the grave, an idea lifted from Billy Wilder's 1950 masterpiece ""Sunset Boulevard."" Similarities end there: The caustic and brilliant cynicism of Wilder and Charles Brackett's last screenplay together has been replaced by Alan Ball's *pose* of same. When it came out, there was a lot of talk about how ""courageous"" this movie's producers were. I saw no courage in it; merely a clich&eacute;d portrait of suburbia.Suburbia as a soul-draining no man's land is nothing new in Hollywood. ""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit,"" (1955) explored similar themes, and Gregory Peck even shared the same (by now hackneyed) profession -- advertising man -- as Kevin Spacey's anti-hero, Lester. In the classic movie, Peck puts his job on the line to maintain his integrity, and wins. Spacey's ""modernized"" rat boosts his severance package by blackmailing his firm's ""efficiency expert,"" and then uses the proceeds to forever chuck his responsibilities.Its premise, that Spacey has (unbeknownst to him) just a year to live shows him in the throes of a ""mid-life crisis"" in which we find him ""living each day as if it were my last."" So, does he go and write the great American novel? Does he reinvigorate his neglected family life? No; he quits his dead-end job to work at a fast food joint (obviously, a much more self-fulfilling career), exercises, buys a red Firebird and lusts after his teenage daughter's best friend. Whereas Wilder and Brackett conjured memorable flesh-and-blood characters from the printed page, ""Beauty"" scenarist Ball has a reverse-alchemy going on: Despite lots of gratuitous flesh, the characters come off as two-dimensional cardboard cutouts.There was a saying in the dramatic world, ""the play's the thing."" Now, ""the agenda's the thing."" All the characters in this movie aren't characters at all, but *representatives*, stand-ins for various social and political agendas.""American Beauty"" is marketed with the slogan ""Look Closer"": ""Look closer,"" you'll see that the gay couple across the street is just like you and me; the ""macho,"" homophobic, Marine is really a repressed homosexual (who didn't see that coming a mile away?); the ""weird"" drug-dealing peeping-Tom is really a well of philosophical profundity, rivaling Gandhi in depth and Mother Teresa in altruistic impulse; the popular cheerleader is actually this shy, lonely virgin (yeah, right), and the chiseled-chin real estate guy is your typical Hollywood capitalist -- shallow, ruthless, a philanderer and (big surprise) a gun nut. No matter how much I ""looked closer,"" I couldn't see any real people, or even ideal people that used to populate Hollywood fare. Instead, I kept seeing this PC playbook, written by some narcissistic baby-boomer who demands people view his movie with an open mind, but who himself sees life with blinders on.As character studies, Lester and his wife Carolyn (played by Annette Bening) ain't Joe Gillis and Norma Desmond. In ""Sunset Boulevard,"" William Holden and Gloria Swanson weren't exactly people you'd want in your living room, but you'd certainly go to the Bijou to study them night after night. Their disturbing relationship was larger-than-life human nature at its darkest and most melodramatic. With ""American Beauty,"" it's the people that have gotten small.Occasionally, I actually sympathize with Lester, especially when he's being sarcastic to his wife. But all-in-all, the characterizations are just laughable at best: The scene in which Annette Bening becomes a ""gun-nut"" and goes to the range to work out her frustrations, she manages to get tight shot groups despite her rising arms, due to her twisted, manic, facial expression and breathing while shooting. It's a scene that could only have been written by an anti-gun activist with an axe to grind. Real people at firing ranges know they can't shoot well unless they're calm and collected.But that would contradict the moviemakers' agenda. Likewise with the homosexual couple: They're merely props for Mendes and Balls politics; out of all the main characters in the movie, they have the least screen time (only about 2-3 minutes total), and are only in the script to represent ""normality."" With all the talk the PC crowd devotes to the ""trivialization"" of marginalized peoples, you'd think someone would've complained about how trivial these gay characters were; aside from idly chatting with neighbors, delivering flowers to new arrivals on the block and jogging, the viewer knows nothing about them. But, since Jim and Jim weren't written to be interesting beyond their function as poster children, Ball and Mendes didn't see the necessity.Ultimately, ""look closer"" is a great marketing tool, because upon looking closer, the viewer is left as bereft of any inspiration or entertainment as upon entering. That's how clever its producers are. This gimmick is a new spin on an old Grimm brothers fable, ""The Emperor's New Clothes"": If YOU can't understand it, then it MUST be deep; if you don't agree with Mendes and Ball's worldview, then YOU must be a social regressive; if you don't think suburban life is as bad as they paint it, then YOU'RE not looking ""closely"" enough, and; if upon looking closer, you find it shallow and vapid, then YOU lack depth.In reality, it's Ball and Mendes lack depth: You can't have you're cynical cake and eat your sugarcoated agenda, too. Proof lies in another movie from 1999, ""Election,"" by writer/director Alexander Payne, which explored identical themes as ""American Beauty."" However, ""Election"" bristles with real cynicism, and Payne presents people like you've actually known in your lifetime, and actually gets to the heart of what motivates them in a panoply of human nature. Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon play *internally* motivated people, and thus came off as believable characters, complete in themselves; The cast of ""American Beauty"" were merely crude marionettes dancing on the strings manipulated by an all-thumbs screenwriter and director.The fact that ""Election"" was not even nominated for any Oscars shows that members of the Academy ""looked closer,"" but obviously not at any other movies."	1.0	Look Closer: Hectoring, Moralizing, Stridency	2002-07-11	111	66	45

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A35FIQ83PE0E07	Irikefe Okonedo	Drama in which a middle-class suburban family begins to fall apart when husband and father Kevin Spacey starts going through a mid-life crisis, quitting his job as a magazine writer, befriending his teenage daughter Thora Birch's boyfriend Wes Bentley, starting to smoke marijuana and beginning an obsession with his daughter's best friend Mena Suvari, all in an attempt to dispel the deadness that he feels inside and regain the happiness that he feels that he has not had since he was a young man. Spacey's behaviour serves to further destabilise his already dysfunctional family in which his daughter despises him and his wife Annette Bening and him never have sex: now his wife runs into the arms of another man and his daughter progresses from despising him to being outright sickened by him because of his obvious sexual interest in her best friend. But Spacey doesn't care because he feels that his life was a sham anyway and the only way he can regain what he has lost is by letting go of all the lies and pretences and doing whatever will make him and him alone happy. This film is populated by largely tragic characters, all struggling to make sense of life and escape the despair and bleakness that seems to them to be all that there is. Spacey is reliable as the voice of the movie and the main protagonist going through the mid-life crisis who moves from sympathetic to unsympathetic to sympathetic through the course of the movie. Thora Birch is excellent as Spacey's teenage daughter who feels that she is a misfit and forms a relationship with troubled boy next door and drug dealer Wes Bentley, who has been inside a mental institution and has an unsettling habit of filming people on his camcorder when they don't know he is watching. Annette Bening is on form as Spacey's desperately unhappy estate agent wife whose primary concern is putting on a faade of marital and domestic bliss for the world to see to hide the fact that her family and marriage are falling apart. Mena Suvari puts in a favourable performance as Birch's insecure best friend who derives her self-esteem from the fact that men find her sexually attractive but is secretly afraid that she is nothing special and hence will never gain the adulation that she craves. Finally Chris Cooper is good in a supporting role as Birch's boyfriend Bentley's violent and homophobic father. This film, although largely bleak in tone and quite disturbing at times, is poignant and has a profound message about the importance of seeing beauty in life, which director Sam Mendes symbolises throughout the film with red petals from the American Beauty rose (from which the film takes its name). With a number of revelations and a shocking final twist, this is one of the best films I have ever seen, and easily deserves the Oscars that it won.

I think that this is a film that you either love or you hate. I loved it. The plot was twisted anyway, but the film had some twists that really make it surprising and good. Kevin Spacey delivered a character that makes it easy for the viewer to get into. I thought that American Beauty was very creative, and everything ties in together in the end. It is just the kind of movie that is real, and it makes sense, even though it's kindof weird. Life can be weird sometimes though. Anyway, you may have a completely different opinion after viewing it. Like I said, you love it or hate it. It is not a kid movie though. Its R rating is due to sexual content, including some nudity, drug content, profanity, and a scene of bloody violence.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1TUP0W3IO6IGZ	Jai	"A very unusual and strangely haunting film, `American Beauty' starts off by depicting a seemingly `normal' scenario (an ordinary neighbourhood, an everyday suburban family) and then gradually peels the layers off to reveal  the subversiveness that lies within. It's protagonist Lester Burnham is an  archetypal middle aged family man who has been letting his life chug along  for the past so many years...until inspiration, in the unlikely form of lust  for his teenage daughter's nubile friend, sparks new life into him, and he  begins the process of rebelling against the monotony of his existence. This  is, of course, a sore inconvenience (to put it mildly) to people around  him, not least to his wife, a fanatically, obsessively organized real  estate dealer. Drawn into the fabric of the plot are the Burnhams' new  neighbours - a strange, intense young man with a fascination for Lester's  daughter and for photography, and his domineering, violently conservative  ex-armyman father.  A rich cast of characters and, fittingly, a cast of  performers that more than do them justice. Kevin Spacey's remarkable  talents find their full expression here, in an extremely difficult and  courageous role. Annette Bening is better than one had ever imagined she  could be, the underrated Thora Birch and Mena Suvari are outstanding, and  Chris Cooper, that brilliant, understated actor, is superb as the martinet  father next door. Wes Bentley is very impressive too...but he will have to  prove himself in more varied roles in the future. For all its serious and  disturbing concerns, `American Beauty' is an immensely entertaining film.  Somehow, it manages to be unreal, often very theatrical (director Sam  Mendes is predominantly a theatre person) without ever seeming overdone or  obvious. There are laughs aplenty - mainly as the audience goes along with  Lester, taking malicious pleasure in his digs at conventionality and  orderliness - and only later, in retrospect, can we realize that we were  really laughing at ourselves. For `American Beauty', despite its very  endemic title, is really the story of what modern life has degenerated  into. It's quite possible that even the filmmakers themselves meant it as a  satire on American values and lifestyle...yet, the film is full of moments  that each and every one of us can identify with. Take, for instance,  Lester's impassioned appeal to his wife - `IT'S ONLY A COUCH!"" - when, on  the brink of a rare moment of intimacy, she shouts to him not to spill  champagne on the expensive furniture piece. Without ever adopting a preachy  or self-righteous tone, this film speaks volumes on subjects like  alienation, self-awareness, tolerance, and complacency - themes that are  perhaps even more crucial today to our part of the world than to the  audiences the movie was made for."	4.0	Unusual and thought-provoking	2000-07-15	9	6	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1U7K7K3KRJA67	Jake	This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! It deserves all of it's praise. Kevin Spacey delivers this film as a disillusioned middle-aged man looking to reclaim his life. He quits his job and starts obsessing over his  daughter's Lolita-like friend (Mena Suvari). I initially thought she was  the beauty described in the title, but the title really refers to the  beauty in our lives that we often neglect. One performance that is  overlooked (in my opinion) is that of Chris Cooper, who played the  next-door Marine soldier with a few surprises. Annette Bening and Thora  Birch round out the great performances. Living in suburbia often causes  people to take things for granted and losttouch with themselves. The movie  captured this perfectly. You can be sure I'll buy a copy of this film.	5.0	Absolutely Amazing	2000-05-25	3	1	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2YON1RIMN6QCW	James D. Eret	What a tremendous movie &quot;American Beauty&quot; is? Having just finished watching it on video for the first time, I'm glad I didn't read much about it or see many of its scenes, so the vision unfolding is fresh  in my mind. Academy Awards sometimes help or hurt a movie;was the movie  really the best of the year or was there just so much hype? Racing movies  against each other is, of course, preposterous. But &quot;American  Beauty&quot; is a great film, a subtle and harrowing vision of &quot;family  values,&quot; dreams, and the strange beauty of life; we never know what  turn this movie will take; just when we think one thing will happen, the  film veers off into comedy, drama, longing for love,and just when the  viewer thinks he or she has the plot figured out, another twist, yet with  Kevin Spacey's narration, if we listen closely, we know the ending and then  the mystery starts and it also turns into a thriller, but only for a short  time. Kevin Spacey has never been better. Annette Bening is tremendous, one  of our top actresses. The young people portrayed here come from no TV  sitcom. They are complex, full of surprises, reflecting the movie's  surprises.Some people have complained about the scene between Spacey and  his idealized cheerleader. As filmed, it is of the most touching, sad, and  innocent scenes I've watched in recent movies, positively marvelous; and  lesser actors or directors could have ruined this scene. So what had Spacey  found by rejecting the American Dream (Beauty)? Is he finally happy,  fooling himself, or in some fantasy world of his own making? He has won a  different kind of happiness, fleeting though it may be, but at least he  knows it, has had almost one epiphany after another until the shocking  conclussion,and the shock is that the murderer was someone else, someone  who also is lost in the American wilderness of pain and like so many  incidents on the news, finds a final outlet in violence. If more parents  would watch &quot;American Beauty&quot; together, we might have less  Columbine shootings; its always the supposed to be a &quot;shock&quot; that  in a nice neighborhood, things like this don't happen, neighborhoods of  secrets and of, if we look around, days and details of great beauty, and  the greatess gift, the gift to be alive an enjoy each day. &quot;American  Beauty&quot; is a masterpiece that demands to be seen again and again.	5.0	American Beauty: Ambivalence and Wonder	2000-05-13	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1A535W556ROBQ	James Ferguson	This movie has a strong seductive appeal but ultimately is a very shallow look at lust.  Lester is a bit too superficial a characterization of a man experiencing mid-life crisis, as he tries to reclaim his lost youth. Keven Spacey plays Lester with plenty of hubris but with very little meaning.  More impressive, by far, is Chris Cooper's characterization of a deeply repressed father who ultimately has to confront his own sexuality. Unfortunately 3 teens get caught between these two disfunctional father-figures and thereby creating the rub of the story.Lester has become fixated on his daughter's high school friend, played with coquettish delight by Mena Suvari.  Unfortunately Mena never rises above an object of affection, with the camera fawning over her every move as it would in a soft porn movie.  Meanwhile, Lester's daughter (Thora Birch) is drawn to a reclusive, sensitive teen (Wes Bentley) who becomes Sam Mendes' surrogate in the fim.  The young teen turns out to be a voyeur, capturing Thora's every move on digital film.  This oddly narcissistic relationship also fails to develop in any meaningful way other than to provide the occasional ephemoral image such as Wes filming a plastic bag as it is picked up by a swirling wind and tossed about in the air while Thora vacuously looks on.  Then we have Lester's wife (Annette Bening) who is pursuing an affair of her own with her real estate broker (Peter Gallagher) who promises to take her to great heights, only to be shocked that her husband could stoop so low as to work in a burger stand, when they pull up for a hamburger.  The movie would have easily drifted out of control if it weren't for Cooper's mesmerizing performance as the authoritarian father who can no longer discipline his son.  Cooper ultimately is forced to confront Spacey in the most memorable scene of this movie, and probably what earned this film its Oscar.  But, Mendes makes it painfully clear in the closing scenes that he didn't know how to handle the fallout of the confrontation, opting for the easy way out.The characters will grab you and the film is well choreographed, but this is another case of style over substance. It reminded me alot of Magnolia, in its attempt to create highly emotive scenes without providing sufficient background for the viewer to identify with these emotions. I think mostly because Mendes and Ball didn't understand these emotions themselves, but see them as convenient stage tools to create this impressionistic view of suburban America.	3.0	Just so much stage craft	2004-02-26	4	2	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ALJGB7XHPFCR	James R. Mckinley	"Despite what some critics say, this isn't a movie about pedophilia. Its a movie that describes one very average Joe trying to find a greater happiness. There is a counterpoint about a completely misfit and unique young man whose eyes have already been opened - and sometimes he doesn't know if he can bear all the beauty. In my opinion, the meaning of American Beauty is spelled out for the audience in the scene where Lester grabs the sofa cushion and berades Carolyn, ""ITS... JUST... A... COUCH!"" In the following moments, Lester sheds some light on his spiritual changes, but they're not complete. No, getting the fast-food job wasn't the answer... trading in his car wasn't the answer... and just before seducing the fantasy girl, he realizes that wouldn't be it either. That's key: he realizes it beforehand. When talking to the little blonde after their encounter, he's just an inch from enlightenment, very close, stretching, reaching... now do you see why he's smiling at the end, and why the misfit isn't upset? Far too many people misunderstood this movie because of  a knee-jerk reaction to superficials, instead of considering the underlying meaning and the director's intent.  In any event, the folks who criticized this movie were taking it way too seriously. Kevin Spacey was hilarious. He nailed the role of a disillusioned and disenchanted surburbian man caught up in a rat race he wanted out of. So he fantasized about his daughter's best friend, he ended up ""doing the right thing"" in the end. I loved his new car and ""career change.""

Through a flawless combination of brilliantly executed acting, superb character dialogue, and stunning imagery...American Beauty is able to accurately, darkly, and  comically examine life behind the tranquil facade of American suburbia.  The film renders a powerful message without moralizing, while making use of  extremely sharp and witty comedy.  The transition between scenes can be  surprising, but always maintains fluidity and coherence throughout. It is  impossible to watch American Beauty without evoking feelings that run the  gamut of the human emotional spectrum.  You'll laugh...you'll cry...but  most of all, you'll think.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AUBZX3Y7SQ5H5	Jamus Phillips	American Beauty is my second favorite movie.  I could talk forever about how great this movie is or about all the &quot;things&quot; that one is supposed to &quot;get&quot; from watching &quot;American Beauty,&quot; but I won't.For those of you who have not seen &quot;American Beauty&quot; I say only that the movie tells a story (albeit one that many people don't want to see, or perhaps be confronted by) and tells the story truthfully and beautifully.  Whether or not one wants to see a 40-something year-old man obsess over a teenage girl (or any of the other stories and circumstances in the movie) is not important.  &quot;American Beauty&quot; is one of the few movies brave enough to expose many of the follies and inhumanities of individuals without wavering; but it also presents the beauty and humanity that lies within every individual (even in Colonel Fitts...watch very closely).To sum things up, &quot;American Beauty&quot; challenges the viewer and makes him think about his or her own life in new ways and about the war between humanity and inhumanity.  And if the viewer learns &quot;something&quot; after viewing &quot;American Beauty,&quot; then the movie has completed its mission.  Some of you may have to meet &quot;American Beauty&quot; halfway...and that's ok.  I promise that watching this movie is a fulfilling experience.  If you can just give it a chance, then you're giving yourself the chance to become a better person.	5.0	Truth &amp; Beauty	2001-11-13	6	3	3

At first we are introduced to a man, Lester, who is the definition of ordinary. He has a job he hates, a car his wife likes and a daughter who doesn't want to talk to him. To the outside he leads the perfect suburban life, but in fact he is totally dissatisfied. After meeting Angela, a friend of his daughter's he totally changes his life. He quits his job, blackmails his boss and starts to work out. Also he begins to consume pot.Becomig more and more attracted by Angela he totally offends his wife by only doing what he likes.In the end he comes very close to Angela, and his family breaks. His wife gets close to shooting him, but in the end it's probaply his gay neighbour who lets him pay for his trecheary of the American Dream. The director Sam Mendes tells this story by the frequent use of strong images, for example rose petals as a symbol for Lester's attraction to Angela, and fitting music.By this the movie suceeds at showing the superficiality of the American suburban society and its ""perfect families"".This makes ""American Beauty"" one of the best movies we've ever seen.Frede & Lorenz"	5.0	A masterpiece	2005-04-07	3	3	0

His wife Carolyn is a real estate agent who is hell-bent on achieving absolute aesthetic perfection, no matter what the emotional cost.As the film moves forward, Lester's heart is awakened by a series of life changing events, as well as the unraveling of his once sheltered existence. The cast is first rate, with Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari providing career-defining performances, though I believe that Wes Bentley's portrayl is ultimately the most haunting.The cinematography is absolutely stunning, and looks very handsome on a widescreen display. The director's commentary from the director is illuminating as well, as many interesting facts and stories are provided for the viewer.Highly recommended for everyone who lives in suburbia, and has ever dared to dream as to what would happen if they took a chance!	5.0	The quintessential tale of American Life	2006-04-28	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A4CHIXX0HOB3G	Jason James	I purchased this movie in hope that I would be receiving a 5 star movie. This movie was a great idea if you cut out Lester's fantasy of his daughter's best friend &amp; his wife screwing around. This movie is obviously not intended for children to even be in the room. It was insulting to see Spacey so hung over a girl that he could have had as his daughter. I enjoyed Spacey's comedy that he added to the movie but, other than that you may just want to pass this one up. It is very over rated in my book. Don't let me be the judge though. Sorry to the people who love this movie but, I DO NOT recommend.	1.0	Kevin Spacey 1 star/The rest of the movie was INSULTING!!	2004-01-10	30	9	21
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2FLGETO9FL3UX	"Jason Michael O'Brien ""justjason"""	"American Beauty, this chilling yet humorous look at the typical American family trapped in the world of suburbia.  The movie is all about appearances, ""In order to be successful one must project an image of success at all times.""  That is probably one of the overall themes of the movie.  Many of the characters find success to be something all their own through validation of themselves or from another, and you see how their belief in that either makes them better or tears them down.  Sam Mendes, the director of this incredible movie was able to select an awesome cast, including Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Allison Janney, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and Peter Gallagher, all of whom were able to believably bring their character life through just a look or a line.The fantastic movie and incredible cast should be enough to buy this DVD, but it is also loaded with bonus features.  The commentary is wonderful and informative, really breaking down the shots and informing you on what was cut out.  This definitely shows the insightfulness of the director on making sure that there was no unnecessary dialog that would take away from the moment.  Even the behind the scenes featurette was a pleasure to watch.If you haven't seen this movie yet, it is definitely worth you time.  The acting is superb, the quality is excellent and the features are outstanding.  American Beauty deserved all 5 Academy Awards including best picture, because this is truly ""Spec-tac-ular""."	5.0	American Beauty Review	2001-01-25	5	3	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3DE1IYJGU5HPW	Jason N. Mical	American Beauty is one of those rare Hollywood films that actually dares to push boundaries, make audiences think, and - most importantly - impress enough people that it wins a much-deserved Academy Award.American Beauty is many things; a not-so-subtle portrayal of the hollowness of consumerism and consumer culture, a coming of age story, a treatise on the Heideggerian notion of beauty existing everywhere.  It manages to weave all these things together splendidly, while leaving the viewers enough room to work things out on their own.  Some of the symbolism is blatant, and the shallowness in suburbia where &quot;nothing is as it seems&quot; is nothing new, and other films have probably dealt with it in better ways, but American Beauty manages to overcome this flaws mostly with outstanding performances from all the main actors, especially Spacey and Benning.Some of the characters, especially Ricky's dad and mom, and occasionally Benning's Mrs. Burnham, are a little underdeveloped and two-dimensional.  Many of Thora Birch's lines to Kevin Spacey seem a little &quot;stereotypical&quot; of the &quot;angst-ridden teen,&quot; and almost push the boundaries of plausibility, especially in the beginning - &quot;you can't just expect to be my best friend just because you had a bad day at work&quot; comes off as forced, no matter how many times I watch that scene.There is nothing special with the cinematography, and the cgi-roses are almost an overused, tired metaphor at the end of the film.American Beauty is a moving, disturbing piece of filmmaking that manages to put some heavy philisophical concepts regarding art and aesthetics into forms that the average Joe can understand, and will satisfy even those who feel Hollywood turns out nothing decent anymore.  Sit back and enjoy one of the many gems that Hollywood turned out in its bumper crop of good films last year.DVD Dirt -The transfers are good, but not perfect.  There are minor black lines and dots throughout the film, especially noticable whenever there is a lot of color on the screen.  The sound seems a little quiet as well.  The commentary is supposedly by director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball, but Ball hardly manages to get a word in edgewise, and Mendes really doesn't share any earth-shattering insights about the film, although they do manage to talk the entire time, which is refreshing.  The behind-the-scenes featurette is OK, although almost seems like filler they added just to say it was there.  Some deleted scenes might have been nice, especially the entire original introduction, but I guess we'll have to wait for it.	4.0	Awards Edition good, but deserves no awards	2000-10-25	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1NAGYEOC6ZEHW	Jason Schwab	American Beauty is the first film in a LONG time that I think deserved the Best Picture Oscar.  The film is a clever setup, with pissed off characters in a suburban setting, showing that suburbia is FAR less innocent than we may believe (or want) it to be.  American Beauty is one of the only films with a beginning that REALLY pulls you in, that makes you want to see more.&quot;Want me to kill him for ya?&quot;&quot;Yeah, would you?&quot;That first glimpse into the film makes you wonder who this guy is that we're about to follow, during the final portion of his life.  The images of roses, nudity, cleanliness, and the camcorder make this film very unique.  It's one of the first films in a long time to have memorable symbolism.  Watch this one with a group of friends, and talk about it afterwards.	5.0	A refreshing combination of genres	2001-07-08	4	0	4
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1JW73MEZF612K	Jay Alan Akin	"Take notes.  There WILL be a test.American Beauty is perhaps the most controversial film to ever win the Academy Award for Best Picture.  To understand why it won, and why its triumph was so disagreeable to a large segment of the American public, I offer the following observations as a public service:American Beauty is a satire of middle America that exposes its hypocrisy comedically while massaging those parts of the American psyche (mostly big city sophisticates or well to do suburbanites) who feel superior to the bourgeois mind.  As such it makes those members of the audience who had expected to see a sort of Titanic of Suburbia uncomfortable while greatly pleasing fans of, say, Pulp Fiction or Blue Velvet.Another way to look at American Beauty is as an exercise in fantasy wish-fulfillment.  As such it delights those whose fantasies are realized and offends those who had different fantasies or whose fantasies remain repressed.  Annette Bening's character gets her unspoken fantasy fulfilled as she is sexually liberated by ""the King,"" a real estate salesman ""clearly superior"" to her mediocre husband, Lester, played by Kevin Spacey.  Lester of course gets to live out his fantasy, that of telling the boss to shove it while winning the heart of the teen queen of his adolescent dreams.  And Ricky Fitts, the boy next door, who might be your standard loser who eats his sack lunch behind where the drama geeks hang out, is in fact a smooth operator who deals dope discreetly (and successfully), gets the other beautiful girl and goes one or two up on his fascist dad.  He is a sort of Homer Simpson denizen turned into a Humphrey Bogart for the new millennium.  Note too that the gay guys down the street (except for their...uh, persuasion) are indistinguishable from any other over-socialized adorable yuppie couple just joining the community church.  This is a little joke on the heartland, and a sly, oblique wish-fulfillment for some Hollywood homosexuals.Since about half the audience really did expect to see Titanic or its equivalent, and instead got satire (something they can never really understand) you've got to expect some outrage.  After all this was an Academy Award winning film entitled ""American Beauty.""  What we should have here is an ""America the Beautiful"" kind of opulent production (perhaps with the ""Heartland of America"" feel of a Chevy truck commercial) done with the usual duplicity and an assuaging mentality.  Any picture the Academy votes as best picture of the year ought to make us feel good about ourselves, don't you think?  If we wanted ""art"" or liberal propaganda we'd have gone Off Broadway.  Instead we are made uncomfortable about our secret desires and our hypocritical life style and the little lies we tell ourselves and friends.As for those who merely think American Beauty was over-rated: you get a B+ because you're right, it was.  If you also pointed out that Hollywood beat a few already very dead horses here (the war lover who is a closet gay or the straitlaced frigid wife who really just needs some vigorous sex) you get extra credit.  And for those who think this was a great movie, it can be said you might be right.  But any contemporary work of art, especially one that has as its subject matter the contemporary scene, can only be judged ""great"" some years down the road since we have, as yet, no real objectivity about ourselves or our culture."	5.0	American Beauty 101	2002-09-12	8	5	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A28ERDII8FZQQ9	J. Daniel	"Of course this review will be the small voice of dissent in a sea of praise, but I'm writing for the few who will listen. Okay so this movie was making a statement about what is wrong with America today, it's supposed to deal with the superficiality of the American suburbs, the hypocrisy of family today, blah blah blah. You get all of that within the first 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of it is all rose petals falling and an excuse pass off nudity as ""art"". At no point in this movie was it necessary to for us to see Mena Suvari's breasts. They were totally completely superfluous to the movie. But, hey, this movie is an ""artistic masterpiece"" so, therefore some nudity is required. Every single scene in this movie was the director screaming from the rooftops: ""look at me, I'm making an artistic movie and since many of us aspire to be 'intellectual', i.e. pretentious, we'll praise it because it's 'different' "". What was the point of this movie? Was he trying to get across a message that something is wrong with American society today? If so, he could have done it without Mena Suvari's breasts, the rose petals, and of course the most ""beautiful scene in the whole movie"" - I refer of course that oh-so-profound scene where the the marijuana-peddling voyeur neighbour says that the plastic bag flowing in the wind was so beautiful. Gosh, that statement had me almost emptying my stomach in the wrong way. Ok, I'll admit that at certain points in the movie, I had to laugh out loud, there was definitely some good humour, but most of this movie, was a useless, senseless, pretentious waste of film. So the director wanted to make the statement that something was wrong with society today. Tell me something I don't know. Look for the beauty in everyday life? Sure, but it wasn't anywhere in the movie. Compare this to another movie which wanted to bring home the tragedy of the twisted world we live in - Life is Beautiful. The director of that movie didn't need to show breasts, didn't even need to use curse words and what little violence there was was implied. Yet it brings home to all of us, how cruel and beautiful and complex human beings are. Another good movie which released around the same time - Fight Club. Also a very brilliantly done movie. The best way to get a social message across is subtlety. This movie was as subtle as sledgehammer. All this movie does is take the worst possible in all of us and put it onscreen. Either way, there was no reason for anybody to see Mena Suvari's breasts. Of course this review will just be voted least helpful, but hey, somebody had to be brave enough to criticize this movie."	1.0	This Doesn't Deserve ANY Awards....	2002-02-01	53	26	27
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2J5WTBWFP6JYF	"J. Dougherty ""ribald12"""	This story has been done before. Hemingway's &quot;Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&quot; comes to mind.Certainly manicuring the lawn (or being a sports junkie, having affairs, seeking solace in therapies and spiritual groups, reliving your guitar playing youth at age 42) are symptoms rather than causes. They are symptoms of a life gone stale, attempts at salvaging meaning where it has been lost. This movie is all about people trying to find meaning in their lives. Most of us who are honest with ourselves can relate to that.Now the central question that many will ask is why does the meaning get lost? You may suggest it's out of neglect. But I suggest it's due to the natural course that relationships run, coupled with - and this is most important point - the guilt one feels and/or obligations one gets wrapped up in as a result of our patterning our lives after what our culture has brought us up to believe is the road to true happiness: a long-term, commited relationship. Most of us come to question this idea, see the folly of it. Whether it is folly is the springboard from which discussions about this film should arise.Certainly divorce rates are higher today simply because the stigma of getting divorced has been largely removed, not because people are any less happy in their marriages than they were when divorce was rare.	4.0	Very good film - the story has been told before, though	2001-07-12	3	0	3

I love Kevin Spacey andthe hype for this movie was tremendous, so it was hard to not find outthe plot...When I finally saw it, I understood that it was a smaller movie than I was expecting, in every sense...the time they take over the &quot;dancing bag&quot; expresses this...but funny, and not cruel.  I was, I admit, slightly disappointed that I wasn't getting the performance of Kevin Spacey's lifetime here (... there is, to my mind, more complexity to other parts in other movies) but he is dead-on ... as Lester and very, very human.  Entire supporting cast should receive separate Oscar as a group for total excellence.  All of them were phenomenal.This film is a change from last year's Titanic.  I am glad to see that a movie, smaller in scale, like American Beauty, can be made and win awards...Reminding us that we are human and nothing is guaranteed. To caution us with stylish humor how precious life is, is not a bad thing, once in a while. It keeps a perspective on what's really important, doesn't it?Watch this movie.  I think possibly it will change some of us in some imperceptible manner, no matter our ages, in our attitude toward what is going to come first when we get up every morning.

This movie is both a comedy and a drama.  The movie is thoughtful with twists, humor, and storyline.  The acting is superb.  The movie is about a man that is 42 years old with a wife and daughter.  They pretty much hate each other and are all pretty much miserable.  The main character Lester Burnham(Kevin Spacey) narrates to you that he will die in less than a year.  He doesn't know it, and he doesn't tell you how he does.  From this point on, he pretty much tries to turn his life around from being miserable into being happy.  In the process, he makes everyone else miserable and everyone hates him then.  The movie is quite hilarious and is very enertaining.	5.0	An American Beauty of a Movie	2002-10-15	1	0	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2KAVOGWK3BRB7	"Jeffrey A. Veyera ""Jeff Veyera"""	Let's take a break from the sycophancy no doubt inherent in the reviews below (as in the media) and cast a critical eye on &quot;American  Beauty&quot;, shall we?The most useful method for conducting this  analysis is to compare it to the pro-American movie it slyly parodies,  &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot;  This is not the departure it may seem---a key  image from &quot;Beauty&quot;, a trashbag floating about the street, is  clearly a backhanded homage to the feather so prominent in  &quot;Gump.&quot; One of the main characters refers to this image of  wind-borne litter as the most beautiful thing he has ever seen, which  should confirm the skewed vision of the film.  This movie is the  anti-&quot;Gump&quot;.For those who don't recall, &quot;Gump&quot;  exploded on the scene in 1993, a pro-family, pro-South, pro-America,  pro-military movie which absolutely stunned the critics with its success.  It portrayed an America in which people were generally kind and decent, no  matter how conflicted and unhappy they could be from time to time, usually  through the prevalence of drugs, sex, and alcohol abuse.  In  &quot;Gump&quot;, the protagonist, though not hip or savvy, managed to  succeed merely by virtue of being a good man, eventually passing on his  homespun wisdom to his son.The success of this film no doubt made a  big impression on the creative forces behind &quot;American Beauty,&quot;  for they sought at every turn to craft a successful, critically-acclaimed  movie which would be the complete opposite to &quot;Gump&quot; in vision.In &quot;Beauty&quot;, the &quot;heroes&quot; are a middle-aged,  pot-smoking pedophile lusting after one of his 16-year-old daughter's  friends; his dealer, who happens to be dating his daughter; and the  daughter herself, a shrewish little girl who hates her parents (with some  reason).  The cast is rounded out by a homophobic, latent homosexual Marine  Colonel who happens to be the dealer's dad (how original for Hollywood);  the main character's hideous whore of a wife; and the only character in the  film with the least bit of humanity, the object of the protagonist's  perverse affection, played with great talent by Mena Suvari.The  movie's plot is an unholy mess, revolving around the protagonist's mid-life  crisis and how it brings about his demise.  This is merely a narrative  gimmick to allow the director to string together yet another series of  scenes depicting how life in the 'burbs is simply hell on earth.This  is typical Hollywood Baby Boomer drivel.  The only saving grace of this  movie is the fantastic performance of Mena Suvari, who brings brass and  vulnerability to the portrayal of her character, a normal girl amidst a  bunch of fools.  Even the normally superb Spacey is wasted on this script,  which calls for the audience to identify and sympathize with a character  we'd loathe outside the theater.Don't believe the hype.  &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a terrible movie.  If you want an indictment  of life in suburbia, pick up &quot;Doing Time on Maple Drive,&quot;  &quot;Ordinary People,&quot; or &quot;The Great Santini&quot; instead.  If  you want a movie which is a true reflection of America, pick up  &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot;  Either way, your time will be much better spent  than on this piece of Hollywood pap.	1.0	&quot;American Beauty&quot; Appreciative of Neither America nor Beauty	2000-07-05	26	9	17

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2V3P1XE33NYC3	Jeffrey Leach	"I am the first to admit I watch a lot of movies. In fact, I watch far more movies than the average person ever should. That I don't burn through DVD players every few months or wear eyeglasses the size of a mountaintop telescope is amazing considering I mix my movie experiences with healthy doses of reading and studying for my master's degree in history. I came to the conclusion long ago that I need my hour and a half a day movie to relieve stress. And since I avoid broadcast television like the plague, spending a couple of hours with a movie ensures I stay plugged into the all important pop culture conduits that crisscross every level of our society. Despite what most people say, movies and movie watching will tell you more about the world you live in than any other source of information. One need go no further than the movies, although I would recommend books as well, to understand the history of modern America. Take the 1990s, for example. No other film sums up the decade of political correctness, the Clintons, and the culture wars better than ""American Beauty."" How you look at this film depends entirely on your opinion of that decade.""American Beauty"" tells the story of the Burnham family, specifically patriarch Lester (Kevin Spacey), matriarch Carolyn (Annette Bening), and daughter Jane (Thora Birch). Set in a place the lunkheads in Hollywood hate with the heat of a million suns, suburbia, the movie begins with Lester speaking in voiceover. He tells us that he died, and he tells us that he will show us why he died. O.k., that's an interesting way to hook the viewer. And since Spacey's a pretty talented actor, I'll keep watching. The Burnham household is not a haven for happy campers. Lester slaves away all day at some phone/marketing job that he obviously hates. Wife Carolyn spends her time competing with Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) in the dog eat dog world of real estate. Jane Burnham is a teenager obviously unhappy with her physical appearance since we see her checking out plastic surgery sites on the Internet. Although the Burnham family does not yet know it, their lives are about to transform in significant ways. It all starts when Lester loses his position at the firm due to a restructuring. Fortunately for him, he knows some sordid information about his employer that allows him to walk out with a hefty severance package.Lester's change--let's call it a regression to the halcyon days of his youth--isn't due solely to his dismissal at work. Jane's attractive friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) captured Lester's eye, and when he overhears her make a comment about how good looking he is, Burnham decides to embark on a radical regimen of weightlifting to improve his physique. Lester also takes a stand against his overbearing wife for the first time in years, which eventually drives Carolyn into the arms of an unlikely lover. In the meantime, Lester also buys a hotrod, finds a job at a fast food restaurant, and begins to dally in drugs with the help of neighborhood dealer and new next-door neighbor Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Jane falls into the orbit of the enigmatic Ricky as well, and the two strike up a rather unusual relationship in which both can find solace from their emotional pain. Ricky's life is far from perfect; he must constantly deal with his physically and psychologically abusive former military officer father, referred to as the Colonel (Chris Cooper). The entire film centers on how these various people interact with one another.When ""American Beauty"" came out in 1999, we all heard the endless panegyrics praising every aspect of the picture. Those ""in the know"" proclaimed it a modern masterpiece, a sublime objet d'art that cut to the core of the modern American existence. Uh...no. I'll accept the argument that Kevin Spacey turned in a stellar performance as a man so tired of his dreary existence that he seeks refuge in the comfortable memories of his teenage years. I'll also accept the claim that Wes Bentley does a fine job in the difficult role of Ricky Fitts. I think all of the performers did a good job with their respective parts. But ""American Beauty"" as a modern masterpiece? An insightful look into the vacuous core of modern America? Sure, if you're a left-winger who thinks America is a horrible place to live. According to this film, if you're a member of a traditional American family living in the suburbs you will never be truly happy. You will never find fulfillment in anything you do because your existence is pretentious and emotionally stilted. Moreover, it's been a long time since I've seen a film that harbors this much hatred for the armed services. According to ""American Beauty,"" military men are pure evil because they collect guns, National Socialist regalia, physically abuse their family members, and are deeply hypocritical about very personal issues. The film makes sure that it draws a distinct connection between military service and these traits; it hits you over the head with it repeatedly. I could go on and on.Extras on this ""Award Edition"" DVD include behind the scenes stuff, a commentary track with the director and writer, storyboard presentations, two trailers, cast and crew biographies and filmographies, and production notes. I think I can still give the film three stars solely for the great performances, the even better score, and good atmosphere (love that opening shot swooping down the street). But I find the beating of chests and gnashing of teeth plotline about the destructive effects of suburbia banal and extraordinarily false."	3.0	Not ANOTHER film about surburbia!	2005-01-07	13	7	6

All the actors in this movie shine in their performances, though Kevin Spacey and Wes Bentley appealed to me the most.  The film's analyses of inner workings of a family with a midlife crisis, a  failing marriage and an adolescent girl are extremely poignant and real.  And the commentaries on sexuality are equally strong. All this in addition  to a well-developed plot that draws an audience in from the beginning.

Her neuroticism throughout the film is unparalled by any contemporary actor/actress.  The biggest suprise of the 1999 Academy Awards was that Benning did not win the best actress nod. Every aspect of this film carries the quality, visual impact, and emotional excellence of nearly every classic ever idolized by film gurus over the ages.  Kevin Spacey's performance was not only the apex of perfect... it was inspiring.  I am not allowed enough words to detail just how well Spacey made Lester Burnham incredibly believable.  &quot;I RULE!&quot; pretty sums up the film.	5.0	Who's afraid of Lester Burnham?	2000-10-05	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	If this movie is about dysfunction, then the creators have succeeded.  They have displayed that dysfunction can range from non-communication to drug dealing to murder.  In the end, the message is unclear and somewhat alarming.I can't say I hated this movie, but it is not what I call entertaining.  The story of a suburban neighborhood and it's off the wall residents does not ring very true with most of my experiences but writer Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes seem to want us to believe that what happens is fairly normal.  Maybe I mis-read their message.  Maybe they have no message.  It's possible that they're painting a scenario in which two dysfunctional families are thrust into each other's lives and the combination of certain elements (repressed gay father, drug dealing son, isolated daughter and her mid-life crisis suffering dad) is the catalyst for several events that normally would NOT happen on the typical suburban street.In any case and for the most part, I don't think the writer's story of these circumstances is a perception of real life.  It may be his perception as he grew up, but perception is relevant.  His perceptions may have been born out of his life growing up and what he experienced.  Between this movie and his work with the HBO show Six Feet Under, I have to draw the conclusion that he not only has an obsession with death, but he might be gay himself.  Please don't go off in a tizzy, there's nothing wrong with being gay.  But these days, gay people suffer hatred of those intolerant and his writing may be a reflection of the intolerance he has experienced.  Most writers write from what they know, and this may be no exception.But I could be wrong as well.  He may be just writing about gay people, in which he has written some very good work, exploring them as humans and their different facets.  We have a perfectly normal gay couple living on the street, as well as a gay father who is repressing his own homosexual tendencies.Kevin Spacey plays his role very well.  From the beginning we are made full aware of his daily anguish that he goes through trying to deal with his life.  What I don't like is the way irresponsibility is displayed as acceptable, and even praised behavior.  The creators are trying to make me believe it ok that a father can just quit his job to chase his youthful dreams.  It makes me really mad that the young teenager who is selling drugs is the one we are supposed to see as the hero when he comes knocking on the door of his girlfriends house telling her he wants to take her away to Amsterdam.  Do we think they are going just for the history?  No.This is my biggest problem with this film, that I can't see any reason to like any of the characters.  Relating to them is liking them.  No one seems to think they can be held accountable for their actions, and I cannot relate to that at all.  There are consequences to everything we do, good and bad.  And no one in this film seems to have consideration for those around them, and the story does not display this, except when you turn down the advances of a homosexual neighbor, then you may be shot in the head.I mentioned before that I believe Alan Ball has may have an obsession with death, and if his writing is a message about living life to fullest before we die, then fine, I can understand that.  But life is about balance, and balance requires a dose of reality and doing what needs to be done as well as what wants to be done.  I'm sure we would all like to save time by not eating or sleeping, but we have to do it...or else we die.Let me end on a good note; the movie is very well acted and photographed.  The performances by Spacey and Birch are top notch and Chris Cooper is always reliable as well.  The movie is watchable, if not a little slow at times.  In all, I would say it's a good movie, if you like movies that have no redeemable characters and there is no good that comes from the story.  Please don't misunderstand, there is nothing wrong with this type of movie, it just isn't entertaining for me, and that is just my opinion, even if it is unpopular.	3.0	Not a 'pretty' movie	2004-11-22	5	0	5
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3RG63LCFH9QN3	Jem	American Beauty is a modern day tradgey. It is easy for me to see how some people can find it funny, and other appalling. The bottom line here was not so much the disfunctionality of the family but how if you look with the  right perspective every little thing in life can be beautiful. How it is  never too late to change, and how percious life is. Kevin Spacey's  character opens narrating and states that he will be dead in less than a  year. I think this clues you in on the fact that this film is not meant to  be a happily ever after. As for your children seeing this and seeing a  family that has grown a part and a best friend without morals... You can  not shelter them forever. This film is about a reality that happens all the  time in todays society. Now I am not saying it is suitable for 5 year olds  but that is what ratings are for, If you are taking your children to see  films that are rated R in the first place you are only getting what you are  asking for... Contraversial and well written, but only appreciated by an  open mind...	5.0	Look Closer..	2000-03-23	16	10	6

Same Mendes and Alan Ball, both newcomers to movies, created a wonderful movie about a disfunctional  American family.  Kevin Spacey got a well deserved best acting Oscar, and  Wes Bentley gave an unbelievable performance as Ricky Fitts, the only  person in the film that can see the beauty of the world.  Never have I seen  a movie that can make me laugh and then make you just sit back and go  &quot;WOW&quot; within minutes of each other; the scene where the family is  eating dinner after Lester quits his job has to be one of the best acted  scenes I've ever seen.

It gave a big old shot in the arm, and made the art form interesting.Kevin Spacey is pure genious in this movie.  I am not one of those that moons over him, but I must give credit where credit is due.  You felt his moments, true and powerful, through each facet of this film.The rest of the cast plays their respective roles with comparable passion and skill.  Annette Benning is magnificent, just when the time comes that you want to shake the daylights out of her to wake her up, she does, and with great aplomb.Wes Bentley is a tasty addition, and performs as the misunderstood new kid perfectly.  And he is *so* very pretty to look at.Sam Mendes received many accolades for crafting such a gorgeous, disturbing, colorful, and passionate movie.  Here, added to the pile, is mine.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AC8AUT6O6WZHG	Jenna Horan	"In the film ""American Beauty"", Carolyn, Jane, Angela, and Barbara each portray a different stereotype of modern America.  The ultimate question in the movie is what is beauty? What defines beauty? Is there one type of beauty, and if so , which one of these women is seen as most beautiful?Carolyn, Jane's mother,  can be interpreted as the typical American feminist, she provides for herself and her family through her reality job, but retains the traits of a typical mother, she is first seen pruning roses, and later performing household duties such as cooking and cleaning.  Because Carolyn plays both the role of mother and modern working woman, it is at hard first to decide which category she fits in.  However, due to her affair with another realtor, she moves out of mother and into a modern woman who is equal to men in every aspect.  Carolyn's beauty comes from her love of beautiful things.  She likes roses, expensive furniture, attractive clothing, and wants to present the overall feeling of beauty in relation to her family and home.  To her beauty is more material and is along the lines of perfection.Jane, Carolyn's daughter, is depicted as the average teen with the usual angst-ridden issues to deal with.  She is on the school's dance/cheer team, a very stereotypical subject, but she also presents herself in baggy clothing, dark hair, and dark lipstick.  Jane, playing the usual teenager, doesn't get along with either of her parents very well.  To Jane beauty comes most importantly from the inside.  She doesn't care what her appearance says to others, she wears dark, loose fitting clothing, and ignores her best friend Angela's criticism of her wardrobe.  To Jane, Ricky, her next door neighbor and eventual boyfriend, is beautiful because he observes the world in nonconforming terms.  For instance, Ricky believes that a floating plastic bag is beautiful, because he looks past the immediate response of ""it's just a bag"", and sees beyond into how that plastic bag moves and how it makes him feel.  Jane is beautiful to Ricky, I think, because she is atypically beautiful, meaning that she strays from the ideals of conventional beauty, and lets her feelings and inner beauty show through her hair, clothing, and makeup.Angela, Jane's best friend, is the perfect example of all-American beauty.  She is white and has blonde hair, blue eyes, what would be considered a perfect body, and she is portrayed as a teenage vixen.  Her concept of beauty is completely defined by outer, artificial beauty.  She continually lectures Jane about her wardrobe choices, and prides herself on being physically beautiful, and theoretically the girl of every man's dreams.  Her actions and personality however downplay her outer beauty because she's not very beautiful internally.  In a particular scene, Angela and Jane are standing outside at school and Ricky approaches them, but only speaks with Jane.  Angela is put off and confused by the fact Ricky didn't talk to her.  She has a hard time believing that a guy wouldn't want her attention.Barbara, Ricky's mom, is considered the typical housewife, although she has been so disillusioned from years of living with her military husband, that it is hard to tell if this is her true personality.  Barbara's idea of beauty appears just be having her family fed and happy.  There is a scene where Barbara is cooking a large amount of breakfast, and Ricky enters the kitchen.  She seems to want to just fill up his plate and watch him eat all day.  Her definition of beauty is simple, she wants others to be happy.Applying John Berger's theory of the ""surveyor/surveyed"" to ""American Beauty"" can be thought of in a few ways.  The obvious is every characters surveyal of beauty around them.  Carolyn observes her flowers and her house.  Jane surveys Ricky, and in turn Ricky surveys Jane and soon bases his entire thought of beauty around her.  Angela surveys the physical beauty of others, and Barbara watches her  family in order to see what they need and what will make them happy.  The not so obvious is that each character surveys themself.  They are both the surveyor and surveyed, criticizing themselves and comparing themselves to others.  Each one is trying to find the true meaning of beauty, and what the characters find is that there are many different meanings of beauty, and no one fits every definition."	5.0	American Beauty ...a review for WOMN285 @ SUNY Binghamton	2004-05-11	3	3	0

I've watched this film five times already and see something new in it each time. (Look closer) The cinematography is beautiful and the characters are composed of eerily believable qualities. (They could be YOU) Kevin Spacey's portrayal of a forty-somthing in the midst of a mid-life crisis is hilarious and the events that follow leading to his epiphany is a collage of bittersweet, comedy with a little mystery added in for good measure. The DVD is packed with features including a behind the scenes &quot;making of&quot; and a DVD rom feature that I have not yet accessed. I have found no easter eggs.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	"Think about it, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind. Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only adds to the drama of this film. I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time. I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it. I don't think it could have been any better.Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating. However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film. While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind. I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.While billed by some as a ""comedy-drama"", I don't see anything about this film as funny. Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty. But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list."	5.0	The characters are not what they seem, up until the end........	2006-02-15	3	1	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3E1IUC2T1E6FJ	Jeremy Henry	What makes a movie worthy of a Best Picture Oscar is something that can not be placed on a check list.  You know it after it hits you.  Audiences didn't know how to react, take, or even discuss AMERICAN BEAUTY after it slapped them right out of their semi-comfortable theater chairs.A movie such as this compells you to feel.  Regardless of what the emotion is, you walk away feeling something.  Many people are bothered that they can't stay stone-cold after seeing it.  And just like that feeling, you can't put your finger on why this movie won Best Picture.Perhaps it's because cinematically we've never seen anything like it.  The story itself is primed for Springer: middle aged man goes through crisis, tries to sleep with daughter's best friend while wife sleeps with work competitor.  However, it is how the story is handled that makes it a tremendous step in film-making.  If you would rather not be bothered with color-symbolism and artistic expression in your movies, don't even see this one.  But if elegance and poetry of sight, color, word, and character draws you to a movie, this is your soon-to-be favorite.Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey deliver terribly amazing performances.  Ms. Bening's obsessive and over-worked wife is dead on.  In a particular scene where she tries to sell a Brady-like house, you can't decide whether to laugh, cry, or hurt for her.We should be able to relate to the desperate nature of these characters.  We are all restless beings.  That is our connection...not that we want to sleep with high school cheerleaders.  It is the human aspect painted with vibrant images and poetic storytelling that makes this a must-see.  It is that quality that I can only describe in round-about circles that makes this movie deserving of it's Best Picture win.	5.0	Under-appreciated Gem is a BEAUTY	2000-10-22	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1KXX0K3MR05NB	Jere Overly	To be honest I really didn't understand this movie. I was quite confused by all the supposed subtexts and layers of the various characters. But one aspect of the film that really touched me, as an adult homosexual, were the  scenes involving the (apparently) gay-hating father and how he treats his  son, only to learn that he has lived a life of pain hiding his own  homosexuality. I can relate to this. Although not in the military, I've had  to deal with the pain and internal conflict of dealing with my  homosexuality in a homo-hating world. It's not easy, but like the charcter  in the movie, I often deal with things similarly - lashing out, criticizing  others, trying to make up for my own shortcomings. What a powerful  characterization. I recommend this movie to all gay (and of course  straight) men.	3.0	Finally, Gay issues explored nicely -	2000-06-21	8	1	7

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AJ5PQMS2BN3DP	JG	I rented this movie expecting an insightful piece commenting on the state of American suburbia.  Instead I wasted 2 hours of my evening watching an average piece of drivel not really worthy of my time.  I am not complaining  about the portrayal of underage sex or the use of drugs or even the fact  that Hollywood portrays every ex military person as a closet homosexual  homophobic.  That is so common in movies today that it doesn't really  affect me.  What bothered me is that the script was so contrived and  formulaic.  I have heard so much about the beauty of the words and the  complexity of the story and how you don't see the end coming.  Please, you  know at the beginning that he is going to be dead and you know that the  killer will either be his neurotic wife or the psychotic marine next door.  And the phrases that I hear everyone quoting sound like they came off an  Oprah episode or a Hallmark card.  Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning did  give excellent performances and I did find myself laughing at parts of the  movie.  If this movie hadn't won Best Picture and Best Screenplay, I might  be a little more lenient with my criticism.	2.0	Mediocre	2000-05-27	13	8	5

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2YD1EHWNSJI7Z	Jill Traynor	It's hard to describe this movie to the uninitiated...but I'll do my best. It is the story of Lester Burnham, a middle aged suburbanite, and the neighborhood he lives in. Lester's wife is a relentlessly self-improving  real estate agent who is both envious of and lusts after her competition  (with results so hilarious her's could be counted as one of the greatest  lines in all of movie history.) Lester has no real relationship with his  daughter any longer and secretly lusts after her &quot;best&quot; friend  Angela...and this is just the beginning. From the introverted boy next door  who films everything and his militant father to the two Jims living on the  other side of the Burnham residence, this movie rarely goes where you  expect it to and provides scenes and speaches that are both heartwrenching  and hilarious. Look closer, and perhaps by the end of the movie you'll  agree with the boy next door: There is so much beauty in the world. Whether  the beauty is in the joyous or the tragic, it is there. And in this movie.  As I've stated, this movie defies description...So take from this feeble  attempt what you will.	5.0	A Real American Beauty	2000-05-06	5	4	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AYKYFFCC49HVT	J. Mullin	This was undoubtedly a very good film, with a strong acting job that we have come to expect from Kevin Spacey. He plays the 42 year-old Lester Burnham, who attempts to break free from the humdrum confines of his unsatisfying, suburban existence and to appreciate &quot;beauty&quot; in all its forms. However, it has been hailed by some here, as well as some critics, as this startling, original, life-altering film which in this reviewer's opinion it is most certainly not.Burnham goes through the motions early in the film, (we catch  him in the act of self-gratification in the shower to symbolize the lack of any continued spark in his marriage with Annette Bening), until he is broken out of his doldrums by a strong sexual desire for his teenage daughter's best friend. He leers uncomfortably at the new object of his affections at a high school basketball game (the girls are both cheerleaders), and his descent and &quot;re-awakening&quot; begins. Ultimately Burnham forces his boss to offer him a lucrative severence package at work with some extortionate demands, starts asserting himself a little more around the house, buys a car he enjoys driving, and takes a job at a local burger joint to escape the rat race. The scene of him tossing a plate of asparagus at the wall to demand some respect from his family reminded me of Nicholson's tirade in the diner during Five Easy Pieces, when he couldn't get his wheat toast. All the while, his wife (an aspiring real estate agent) starts a desperate affair with a slimy superstar real estate agent, played with biting accuracy by Peter Gallagher.Ultimately, it was hard to feel too much sympathy for any of the characters in the movie, except maybe for Burnham's teenage daughter and her video-nut boyfriend.  The boyfriend's dad is a crazed neo-nazi with some strong feelings of repressed sexuality who literally terrorizes his brow-beaten wife and son; Annette Bening is an adulterous career girl with no real warmth; Gallagher is a self-important snob happy to bed another's wife; and Burnham himself  turns into a lecherous, self-confident, weightlifting pothead. The action careens toward a climax at the Burnham residence one night when Lester's duaghter invites her teenage  cheerleader friend to stay over, and the ending, while anticipated throughout the film, was still quite effective.The film had its moments to be sure, the cocktail party where Bening introduces her sarcastic husband to a clearly unimpressed Peter Gallagher stands out in my mind as a fabulous scene, and I loved  Spacey attempting to rekindle some romance with Bening on the couch, only to be rebuffed out of her concern for the expensive couch fabric. Witty at times, dramatic, engaging, yes.  Life-changing and startlingly original, no.	4.0	Good, well-acted, but over-rated	2001-01-30	4	1	3

This has convinced me to never watch the Oscars again since it is obviously a &quot;political&quot; organization.  This movie was just dumb AND  disgusting in its semi-pedophilic theme.  I am not a prude but I could  hardly stomach Kevin Spacey's behavior.  With all the discussions about  &quot;family values&quot; I was also disappointed with the complete lack of  reverance in this family and their attempt to spoof (which fell flat,by the  way).  I am tremendously thankful I did not waste my money at the theatre.  Wasting my money on a rental was bad enough.

I particularly enjoyed the director's commentary.  Of note, some people were upset that an alternate beginning and ending that were shot and discarded, were not included on the DVD.  I, for one, am glad they weren't; to have included them would have irretrievably altered the audience's entire perception of the movie, and by so doing, might have ruined it.When all is said and done, &quot;American Beauty&quot; should form the cornerstone of any DVD collection.	5.0	Great movie, great DVD	2001-01-23	4	2	2

Bryan	That's right- it's a rarity (perhaps this is the only time it's ever happened), but this film's title aptly describes the movie itself. It's one of the freshest, funniest and ultimately up-lifting stories about a murder you'll ever see.Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man whose last name should be &quot;Burn-out-&quot; until he catches a glimpse of his daughter's sexy friend. This inspires Lester to go on a rampage of self-improvement. Spacey's a wonder in this role- from his droll voice-over to his character's biting sarcasm. But the performance of the film has to be Annette Bening as Lester's shallow, ambitious, materialistic, real estate agent wife. Bening is by turns falsely charming, overly needy, self-loathing and domineering, but finds vulnerability and believability in a role that, in a lesser film and with a lesser performer, would've become a cartoon. She makes a worthy sparring partner for Spacey. Complicating matters are the Burnham's weirder-than-weird next-door neighbors; Chris Cooper is ferocious as the homophobic Col. Fitts and Wes Bentley plays his son, the videophile with a troubled past who sells pot to the revitalized Lester. Bentley also gets involved in a touching romance with Thora Birch as Lester's daughter.&quot;American Beauty&quot; moves in mysterious ways, teases the viewer with several possible outcomes before ending in violence, but with a strangely serene and entrancing coda that will literally make you feel a whole lot better- sort of like Lester himself. This is a very worthy film that cuts right to the heart of suburban malaise and materialism and finds spiritual lessons and bittersweet humor even in its smallest moments. With Mena Suvari as the trash-talking sexpot friend Lester obsesses over, and &quot;Quantam Leap's&quot; Scott Bakula as neighbor Jim who lives with his lover, Jim. Peter Gallagher (&quot;sex, lies and videotape&quot;) turns in a memorable supporting performance as the Real Estate King, Bening's competitor and mentor- although his mentoring turns very odd.	5.0	Self-reviewing Movie	2001-01-22	2	1	1

You get over 3 hours of supplemental material along with your choice of DTS or Dolby 5.1 surround audio.  All of the studios can take example of how this film was transferred to DVD.  It was a pleasure screening this film on DVD through our new progressive scan home theater system in DTS 5.1 surround.  The print transferred well and is vivid, sharp and clear with the correct aspect ratio.  It truely was like going to my local movie theater.The script was written by Alan Ball of HBO's ""Six Feet Under"" fame.  An excellent story of a man coming to terms with his life in middle age and dealing with it in his own way as well as his self-absorbed wife and daughter.  It's the perfect portrayal of American dysfunctional families.  This plot is combined with other subplots that keep you wondering what's going to happen next.  All of this is the perfect storytelling by Ball who is a master of surprise twists along the way.  The script treatment is perfectly presented by Sam Mendes' directional interpretation.  It's no wonder this film captured 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture!Excellent performances by Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari.  Watch for the very notable supporting performances by Chris Cooper and Allison Janney (The West Wing) and the cameos by Scott Bakula and Sam Robards.This is a must have to your DVD collection."	5.0	Strange But Compelling Film	2006-03-26	1	1	0

Some might argue it is because I've watched it 30+ times, but I beg to differ!  Not only is this one of the funniest movies I've ever watched, but it is also THE most inspiring and enlightening movie I've seen.  Here is an excerpt from the movie... I hope those who are reading this don't get mad at me.  It may spoil the impact of the seen a bit, so be forewarned.&quot;It was one of those days where it's a minute away from snowing and there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it, right?  And this bag was just dancing with me.  Like a little kid begging me to play with it.  For fifteen minutes.  That's the day I realized there was this entire life behind things and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid, ever.  A video's a poor excuse, I know, but it helps me remember... I need to remember.  Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it, and my heart is just going to cave in...&quot;It's scenes like the above that are so original, so poignantly written, that I can't help but be in total awe of them.The score is, I don't even want to say a perfect complement, because as with any great score it seems to meld perfectly with the film and enhance and amplify, and perhaps even add to what is already there.  Thomas Newman has outdone himself.I could analyse this film for hours.  All I can say is rent this, watch it -- then watch it again and look closer.	5.0	Brilliant in every aspect.	2003-09-19	1	1	0

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ACZ6J3L2C0IZ6	"John Cardenas ""opera nut"""	As hyped this year as La Vita e Bella and Shakespeare in Love were last, American Beauty is not without its wry moments and twisted charm; much of it, however, is a simplification of cliches about suburbia: i.e., mindless  affluence, spiritual malaise, and the lust for status.  No one seems to  have pointed out the obvious irony--the fact that Hollywood, a community  known for its mindless affluence, spiritual malaise, and lust for status,  has heaped awards all over this movie.  This movie is hip in its  condescension to the suburbs and yet the swank interiors are chilly  approved of as in a Merchant Ivory film. And when the big moments of  revelation come, they either feel fake (the young cheerleader's insecurity  and self-doubt), smugly juvenile (the young couple's assertion of their  moral superiority over their parents and suburbia, which they are desperate  to escape [to New York--not exactly an original choice]), or like stale  Freudianisms (the martinet ex-marine neighbor's sexual repression).  The  filmmakers congratulate themselves for rising above all this gross  materialism and wealth, and yet have themselves reaped as their reward for  this expose of the empty lives of the bourgeois classes wealth and  notoriety.  The movie does have its moments of visual poetry and some  sharply written scenes, but the overall effect is limp, barren.  This is,  of course, the theme of the movie.  It only partially works thanks to Kevin  Spacey, who fills his role with humor and a hangdog, loser charm.  He's  playing a baby-boomer fantasy of thumbing one's nose at the system and  retreating into adolescent irresponsibility.  The movie asks us to see him  as wiser, as hip in his way as the disaffected young kids are (although  their hipness is of a rather glacial, castigating variety).  But the  conflicts in this movie are simplified: Annette Bening's caricature of a  materialistic, power-hungry harpy makes Spacey's choice less than heroic,  for who wouldn't want to leave her and to reject all that she stands for?  Do the English director and his New York cohorts think that this movie  represents the dirty truth of American suburban life?  That we're all  mindless automatons serving the system, and that only the young and a man  of Spacey's courage to walk away from it all are fully, respectably human?  Aren't they basically perpetuating the cliche that the artistic, sensitive  youths--representatives of the bohemian, alternative culture the filmmakers  themselves presumably came from--this movie ennobles are somehow superior  to their crass, small-minded environment? Does no one recognize the  distastefulness of a European director coming to America and basically  revealing the empty core at the heart of American life and then receiving  all sorts of recognition and awards for it?	3.0	The Glamour of Suffering	2000-03-28	9	6	3

Both screenwriter Alan Ball and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall were honored along with Mendes at the 1999 Academy Awards for their evocation of suburban alienation, but Kevin Spacey, whose cool, cynical narration constitutes the film's central nervous system, deserved all the acclaim he received for bringing Lester to life (including a Best Actor Oscar). Working in a subplot involving Lester's new neighbors, an unhinged Marine (Chris Cooper) and his artsy, drug-dealing son (Wes Bentley), Mendes gives this ""Beauty"" a gut-wrenching finale that completes Lester's transformation."	5.0	American Beauty	2007-07-11	3	2	1

Spacey is excellent  as Lester Burnham, a disillusioned hack writer who embarks on a reckless quest for self-discovery. While alienating his  control-freak wife (Annette Bening) and confused teenage daughter  (Thora Birch), he jumps headfirst into his midlife crisis, befriending the drug dealer next door (Wes Bentley) and lusting after his daughter's best friend (Mena Suvari), among other things. Director Mendes' uncommon approach to common realities is wonderful, and the script is full of pessimism and hilarity, with not a word wasted. Add to that the film's electric visual style, and what emerges is a terrific film about troubled souls.  Musical score is just great with along with the theme and the thoughts of Lester Cunningham (Kevin Spacey).

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW	John K. Reed	Unlike some other films of the recent past.  And to me it was a miracle that a film such as this could garner enough appeal both with the academy and the public alike.  Because much of what the film portrays is not necessarily so flattering about the society in which we live.This film touched on many taboo subjects which I don't want to get into so as not to ruin the film for first time viewers.  And most importantly it attacks those subject areas head on with a take no prisoners attitude.In my mind the real question is just what is true American Beauty.  Well the one thing that I came away with is that real beauty is not what the majority of our society thinks it is.  Meaning that outward beauty and strength are not necessarily synonomous with inner (true) beauty.  And as George Costanza found out that sometimes the opposite of what you think... is often true.What is ultimately expressed by the film is the notion that appearances, respect, and adulation from friends, spouses, relatives or society at large is meaningless without self respect and self direction.  A radical concept for our predominately superficial mindset.Kevin Spacey is phenomenal.An absolute Classic!	5.0	A film truly deserving of the title of Best Picture	2001-03-15	3	1	2

It IS, after all, an entertaining, enjoyable film. But I would not call it a great film.  Enough has been said about the great performances--yeah, they're great, but....It is a message film about middle age, suburban American life, and base materialism.  As a message film, though, it is very odd.  Lester Burnham,successful executive, burns out, blackmails his boss, quits his job, and develops the hots for his teenage daughter's best friend.His shrewish wife, meantime, starts a romp with a local hot shot real estate agent, who turns her on not only to adultery, but to shooting, too, offering the cliched explanation that it makes him feel powerful.Lester's daughter starts hanging out with the weird, pot-dealing son of the fascistic Marine (yes, THAT old cliche) next door.  The boy's father beats the tar out of him routinely, and with particular violence when he suspects his boy might be gay.  Not soon after, during a painful scene of misunderstanding that results from the boy assuring his father that he and Lester have been having sex (not true; he said it to hurt his father), the father makes a pass at Lester.  Yes, ANOTHER cliche:  the Nazi-like homophobe (who actually collects Nazi war relics!)  who is really gay himself!And what about the other messages?  That the best way to deal with a difficult marriage, and life's disappointments is to quit your job, start smoking dope, and paw your daughter's friends?  Seriously?The only normal, well-adjusted people in this  movie are Lester's gay neighbors (the other neighbors), whom we only briefly meet.

Ball depicted these things to invert the normal ""arc of character"" and show that, in a bizarre way, the character's ultimate destiny is fully deserved.In another sense, his fate is a natural extension of Judaeo-Christian justice.

All of our wonderful material possesions, our wants, our desires, all that we strive for are merely illusions substituting as quality. They're just things! The point is emphatically made when Lester Burham tells Carolyn &quot;IT'S JUST A COUCH&quot; when he nearly spills some beer on the fine Italian silk upholstery!  The movie encourages the viewer to look closer. To critically examine lifestyle rationalizations, even the mundane!  Lester reaches a point of breaking the illusion and sees the world for what it is: a series of decisions all bent on making our lives livable. We Americans(in lieu of looking closer) need 'things', instead of attempting the achievable of mindful awareness that these apparently necessary 'things' will only cause additional anxiety!(case in point:Carolyn's anxiety of possibly spilling beer on the fine Italian silk uphosltery!)  We all live there in that place, that illusion of self assured statisfaction...a place that doesn't exist!  Ricky Fitts, is perhaps the only sane, stable character in the movie.

People who can't take off their &quot;dumb&quot; glasses for long enough to see the poignancy of this movie should go back to high school, or at least take  some interpretation course. The producers of this movie are not GLORIFYING  or HERALDING underage sex and the like; how does one get the idea that they  enjoy these or something? American Beauty is the best movie of 1999, if not  the decade, and is the epitome of a blend of comedy, insight, and  poignance. The reason this movie is either loved or hated yields one simple  explanation; American Beauty holds a mirror in front of most families in  the nation, and some just cannot take this. Annette Bening shined as  Carolyn Burnham, but the set was eclipsed by the utter brilliance of Kevin  Spacey. His dry humor and outlook on life are amazing and unequaled in  film. I believe Birch should have been given more credit for her role as  Jane Burnham as well; she portrayed a teenager so similar to many today.  Sure, many of the characters were strongly stereotyped (Birch, Mena Suvari,  Chris Cooper, Allison Janney), but what movie does not contain these?

Instead of just keeping his mouth shut like everyone else, he went unconventional. Quitting his job and lusting after a teenager while smoking pot were his way of saying &quot;F*** You&quot; to those who would try to keep him trapped in their expectations of what they wanted him to be. I love this film because so many people in America are trapped in mundane lives like he was at the beginning of the movie. Everyone has to live in the same kind of neighborhood, send their kids to the same school and soccer fields, go out to eat every Friday, and pretend like this makes them happy. That's why we have the highest divorce rate in the world. Sure, he was killed in the end, but he was looking back at a time when his life was so simple. Look closer at your own life.

Perez ""Jose"""	To be sure, &quot;American Beauty&quot; will strike some viewers as weird and moribund, but no film before it or since prepares one for its utter familiarity as it hits closer to home than most anyone I know expected.  While not every character here feels identical to anyone I know (and thats a good thing, trust me) more often than not, Spacey and Bening are stand-ins for our friends, neighbors, families and even - ourselves.  The simple theme that &quot;everything is not as it seems on the outside&quot; carries tremendous weight, and I dare the viewer to not see themselves and the people they know behind the curtain that separates truth from fantasy.  Kevin Spacey proves why he is THE actor of our generation, while Menu Suvari, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch cast vivid characters likely roaming our neighborhood high school at this very moment.  The four are uniformly grand.However, this is Annette Bening's shining moment.  Nothing this actress has done before prepared me for a monumental performance that literally shook me to the core.  She is at once in control of all around her and yet desperate to experience her own truest self, free from what she knows, who she lives with, and where she is headed.  Bening captures her character's soul and sends it to the stratosphere, long suffering one moment, and kissing up the next.  Her scenes with the &quot;King of Real Estate&quot; show a desparate range of emotion.  Bening deserved the Oscar, though in a year dominated by Hilary Swank's superlative &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; Bening was a deserved first runner up.A movie that actually makes you think twice about your own existence and how your actions affect the world around you in  unexpected ways.	5.0	Brilliant All Around	2001-06-19	6	2	4
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3KFLAXNMTW60X	josh brastad	When I stare down hollywood boulvevard today, it seems packed to the slightest ounce in unoriginality. What puzzles me is just why everyone is claiming &quot;American Beauty&quot;, the supposed masterpiece of freshmen  Sam Mendes, so original. What like tales of confused human souls in  suburbia is something new?  Anyone who has seen Todd Soldoz's  &quot;Happiness&quot; (which is much more funny) and Ang Lee's &quot;The  Ice Storm&quot; (which is much more artistic) will realize that the men  behind &quot;Beauty's&quot; lense had were lacking new thoughts. Even the  main plot of &quot;Beauty&quot; is also nothing new: a middle aged man  going through a typical mid-life crisis, who even has the proper 1960's  props-muscle car to marijuana memorbialia. In short Kevin Spacey is funny,  but thats it.  The performance is barely comparable to that of Jim Carrey  in &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; who's got the funny aspect as well an  utterly timeless performance.  Ditto in terms of Mendes direction.  Interweaving characters in a rather simple fashion is a footnote compared  to the highly-detailed, and breathtaking direction of Spike Jonze (Being  John Malkovich) David Fincher (Fight Club) Stanley Kubrick (Eyes Wide Shut)  and Martin Scorsese (Bringing Out the Dead) but I guess the Academy still  looks towards money, success and public nod instead of complete artistic  originality,  considering those latter three directors weren't even  nominated. But &quot;Beauty&quot; in it's own right is never close to  insipid, as it still retains a low spot on my years top ten list. For a  first time screenwriter, Alan Ball chose the right influence when he  constructed the character of Ricky Fitts, the film's voyeur neighbor. Fitts  is a typical 18 year old: a pot smoker, heavy into technolgy, but in the  same breath he seems to be a transcendal prophet in his time. Almost a  modern day Emerson. Ball must have viewed Terrence Malick's &quot;The Thin  Red Line&quot; before editing the final script, because Wes Bentley's Fitts  resembles Jim Caviezel's Private Witt so closely, its amazing. Set against  a world that is ravished to hell in terms of true eligance and emotion,  they seem to have found their own world where heaven does exist, whether  it's Guadalcancal Island 1943, or a modern middle class consumerville.  When he can't keep his eyes of Jane, a girl who &quot;try's to look  unattractive&quot; instead of Angela, an ego-blonde sexpot, we realize that  Ricky is different, and at this point most watching this film are through  off (considering a majoirity of the audience consists of old people and  high school jocks slumming with their priss girlfriends.. well that's what  I've seen anyway) Although Mendes hopes you don't notice, Ricky is the  film's pivot, not Spacey's played pedophile. Ricky causes the Burnham  family to twist and shutter, as Spacey realizes his youth, and Jane  realizes their is someone who she can connect with and even trust ( on a  spiritual level that streches so much beyond the borders of rural love it  has to be unreal) Like Witt, Fitts may not have many lines, but his quiet  intensity and feeling cause the film to be perhaps more memorable than  sheer originality (such as &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;). So in the end  I say this; take back all the Oscars, and hand only one to  &quot;Beauty&quot;, the one it should have deserved: Best Supporting  Actor-Wes Bentley.	4.0	beautiful but still hollywood	2000-04-08	14	6	8

The plot is unbelivable and the movie is filled with scenes that are just asking for some nouveau artsy fartsy type to find symbolism where it doesn't exist. This movie had nothing to say to me, I got no meaning from it. I found some humor in Lester's actions, but I much prefer the attitude and antics of Peter in Office Space to Lester in american beauty. At least Peter was deep down a good person and balances his revelation with reality in the end. People that enjoyed it seemed to come away thinking it was wonderful, but not really being able to explain why. I came away from the movie thinking that the adult characters are all self absorbed and disgusting and the younger characters are naive, much like the reviewers who gave it a positive review, but feel free to keep looking closer until you find some meaning to this movie.

It made me think about my own life, my path, my place in the world, how stupid life really can be but its these moments which I should give such gratitude for. It also had a beautiful take on death - I never felt so secure after watching this film. Its demonstration of how complex we make life for ourselves and what we think will make us happy was so sternly powerful and moving, for its the more subtle things all around us everyday that we should be living for and give thanks to. We have forsaken our real happiness for the things that we think should make us complete and content as individuals.Alan Ball's script was just too awesome - the way it majestically flowed was so elegant and inspiring. It contained numerous moments of comical excellence but entranced you with its unfolding drama. It managed to mix these things up into one hell of a story and with Thomas Newman's chilling, atmospheric yet sublimely beautiful score it all combined to leave you with a sense of breath-taking emotional awe. And of course the highs and lows of the film's finale - I should have felt sad but it gripped me so powerfully that all I could feel was this astounding happiness and optimism for life. No film has ever made me feel like this.And I'm not alone here or dillusional in its merits and strengths as a film. We may be able to disregard its Best Film at The Oscars seeing The Academy is so unbalanced in its pickings of past Best Picture accolades (Forrest Gump over Shawshank, Shakespeare in Love over Saving Private Ryan for example) but The BAFTA's, Australian Film Institute - Britain and Australia's most prestigious awards committee, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, the Chicago, Las Vegas, Kansas, Dallas Film Critics Association Awards, the London Critics Circle Film Awards, Online Film Critics Society Awards I could go on all gave it the Best Film title amongst other awards to its name. And it was widely accepted by the 'big' (and lesser) film critics Roger Ebert, Rod Dreher, Mike Clark etc as a top 4 star film.Too damn right!	5.0	The true champion of 1999 - American Beauty.	2004-04-04	7	6	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1LP6O85Z894GT	"J. Remington ""John Remington"""	"""They call me the seeker,I keep searching low and high.I won't get to get what I'm after,Till the day I die!""Pete Townshend- ""The Seeker""Les Birnam (Kevin Spacey), a man who has lost his  fire and passion for living slowly rots in a  job that consists of being nothing more than a meaningless cipher buried in a catacomb of desks in a bland office. His life vacillates in abuse between  his success obsessed wife (Annette Benning) and his incommunicado teenage daughter. He even tells us in the opening few seconds that he has recently been killed, but then again, he had been dead for years and didn't even know it.Such is the beginning of Lester's search for rebirth in the satirically focused, poignantly funny and ultimately tragic contemporary film masterpiece ""American Beauty"".Borrowing from his idol Billy Wilder, British theatre director Sam Mendes makes a controversial and riveting film debut bringing visual life to screenwriter Allan Ball's superb script. Working with the brilliant visual artist Conrad Hall, Ball incorperates vivid imagery, clever framing and careful pacing to create a work of art without the least suggestion of pretension.Mendes utilizes his intense  live theatrical training and follows to rule number one of directing: relate a clear narrative in an interesting manner that serves the script.  Unlike many young filmmakers, he achieves rule number one while also obeying rule number two: select images that enhance the narrative while making the director invisible.The cast and crew deserve full marks (and, now as a postscript- the Oscar) for creating a movie that tells a clear story populated with characters we somehow care about. This is no mean feat considering that in lesser and exploitive hands the shallow suburbanites who populate the film could easily have become despised one dimensional cut-outs; or even worse yet, in the cameras of a self important visual wizard (think Terrance Malick or Stanley Kubrick), an obscure and distant philosophical tome.Also richly deserving the Oscar, screenwriter Allan Ball's script plays like an economical novel as there isn't a wasted scene or extraneous bit of dialogue. The dialogue itself breathes fully and truthfully as a living organism as Ball exposes every honest wart of behavior. It also allows Lester to achieve a sense of redemption at the very end of the film as he ultimately makes a moral decision and chooses the right, thereby enabling himself to ""walk into his house justified"" .Ball's characters are people who's obsessions and secrets lead them on a treasure seeking journey celebrating the beautiful frailty that is the human being. Although we the audience, may not desire to admit it, we certainly see either ourselves or our neighbors on the screen.Understand, that this movie is certainly not for everyone. Some certainly will find it dark, cynical and in bad taste. Others, like this reviewer, an insightful, entertaining and memorable experience. Audiences viewing this film will split into such opposing camps. No one, I believe, will say ""Oh, it was okay, I guess.""Such a easily quotable odyssey of a film that polarizes an audience is richly deserving of a look.  ""American Beauty""  is that film."	5.0	A contemporary classic	2003-03-19	4	3	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3OP9CU8GUWI03	"J. Ridgway ""Ridge"""	"It's BOTH.  It's a well-scripted, contrived and slick piece of film propaganda that's acted out by talented actors.I really loath this movie, despite the fact that it is entertaining and won an Oscar.  I loath the fact that it is so manipulative.  I hate the fact that very talented people created a script that has such a depressing and hateful ""moral"" agenda. This movie is very Alinsky-ite to me.  It is cynical to the fifth power, and all its cynicism is directed towards breaking down our repect for the American middle-class nuclear family, as well as other institutions such as free-market businesses and the American military.  American Beauty almost drips with hatred at the white, suburban American family.  Everyone in the movie is selfish and pathetic, except of course, the neighborhood gay couple, who are charming, well-adjusted and happy!  Everything is so contrived and absolutely manipulative.  I can't see why people like it, honestly, unless they just remove their moral sense and totally give in to the movie-makers' agenda.I loath the fact that the protagonist's (Kevin Spacey) daughter seems to care so little about her father, near the end of the movie (more on that below), and loath even more the depiction of the toxic family that her boyfriend/neighbor has.  I hate the poisonous way that the American Job is depicted: either a cynical place that Spacey's character extorts for severance pay, or a depressing place where his wife chases a big Real Estate score and then has an affair with her boss.  Inexperienced and impressionable people who watch this movie may be dissuaded into working for the private sector, and instead seek out paper-pushing bureaucratic jobs in government, because of the toxic nature in which private business is portrayed.  (And NOW we see that private sector jobs are steadily shrinking -- and do YOU things getting better or worse?)  Young people may watch the poisonous and loveless families in this movie and not want to get married or form families (And NOW we see that nuclear families are steadily shrinking, with a tsunami of single-parent families dependent on the government -- and do YOU think things getting better or worse?)&lt; Spoilers Below >The absolute worst part of the movie shows the pot-smoking neighbor boy being browbeaten and physically abused by his over-the-top ex-Colonel father.  The writers then make the Colonel, who warns his son against ""going gay"", out to have secret gay tendencies.  Let me tell you, I guarantee that men who have risen to Colonel in the Army or Marines are quality people and not this kind of pathetic, loveless, dead-end hypocrite depicted here.  I guarantee that the vast majority of families with fathers in the military are good families where their kids love their parents, and their Mom and Dad love each other.  NOT in this propaganda film!  And of course, the adults in the movie are slaves to their sex drives:  Spacey wants to bed his daughter's hot cheerleader friend, his wife has an affair with her boss, and the Colonel wants to act out his homosexual urges.  In the liberal world, sex is our God and we are just helpless pawns to it!There is one scene that I like in the movie where Spacey becomes an adult, but it's followed by a scene of utter loathsomeness.  The one good scene is where Spacey gets his big chance with his daughter's friend, he discovers that she's a virgin, and then he refuses to go through with her sexual molestation, and instead comforts her.  Then unfortunately, he is shot in the head (by whom I won't say).  After he is shot (in his own house), I hate it that the writers show his own daughter simply looking at him with cold amazement, with less emotion than she would have if a dog got killed.  Absolutely no love for her father is shown. No family bond or warmth.  (VERY unrealistic and loathsome. Think if your father got shot!)  Are American teens so much into themselves that they wouldn't even mourn the murder of their own father??? I don't think so, but the cynical writers of this film think so.  Utter cynicism and poisonous contempt of the basic building block of our society:  the American Nuclear Family.So in summary, American Beauty is an engaging yet loathsome piece of propaganda, in which its creators slickly pedal the tenents of their destructive, Alinskyite values:  a) the American Family is a loveless sham; b) all adults are slaves of their sex drives; c) the Military, and the values of discipline that the Military believes in, is to be trashed; and d) Free-Market private enterprise is a corrupt institution and likewise to be trashed."	2.0	Is it Art or anti-American Propaganda?	2009-09-22	3	1	2

And some of the plot developments, especially towards the end of the movie, were desperately contrived, especially the ex-Marine officer turning out to be a closet homosexual.I was particularly disappointed with the performances by Kevin Spacey (his worst I have seen) and Anette Bening, who was so good in Grifters. Admittedly the two younger actors who portrayed their daughter and her love interest were extremely good, and did not fall into the trap of over-acting like their two better-known colleagues.I cannot understand how this movie won the critical acclaim it did.	1.0	Why was this critically acclaimed?	2002-10-23	31	13	18

Sluggett	For you young'uns, Pauline Kael was a powerful, maverick movie critic who, aside from being a brilliantly entertaining writer, often went against the grain of your Rex Reeds and Roger Eberts and viewed and wrote about movies with a depth and clarity that seemed super-human. And smart as hell.This movie has fooled many into thinking it is somehow clever, beautiful and enlightening.  I could not find one less-than-amazed review at Rottentomatoes.com from writers that shoud know better. But friend, think about it just a little bit, how this movies titillates mentally-restful viewers by using the cheapest of devices; by baring the breasts of doe-eyed 15 year olds -  friggin' kiddie porn in 2 scenes no less!  And the protagonist's spiritual awakening consists of smoking pot, working at a fast food joint (with a cliched smiley face logo), driving a hot cherry-red Pontiac and having sex with a 15 year old (which is a crime in the US, ja? no?).Kevin Spacey's original and complex-toned smart-assiness is entertaining and the young girl players are fascinating and beautiful.  Annette Bening, given a straw woman stereotype role that begs to be burned, in the course of 6 seconds still manages to move us in the finale.Another Amazon reviewer cited Ray Lawrence's Austrailian film from 1987, BLISS as the misinterpreted and maladapted source material for American Beauty.  Having seen BLISS several times, and being a huge fan of that movie, I think he is correct.  Written by Alan Ball, a TV sitcom writer, this film pushes a screwed-up message.  It entertains, that is if your brain is on stand-by.  I wish Pauline was still alive to help sharpen our movie vision.	1.0	Come Back To The 5 and Dime, Pauline Kael, Pauline Kael	2007-02-25	28	6	22

American Beauty is a film that takes my breath away each time I watch it, and every time I do watch it, I notice something newer, something more exciting and something more funny. There is honestly no other movie like this, and if you haven't seen it, there is something donged in your head, and you must do so now.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is in a mid-life crisis, caused by his stressed wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and rebelling teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch). When Lester and Carolyn go watch Jane cheerleading, they meet Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), and Lester, caught in sudden lust for Angela, decides to change his life. Angela and Jane's friendship is not all it seems, too, because Angela only brags about how many times she's done it with guys and stuff. That doesn't help an already insecure Jane very much but she finds solace in the arms of the next-door-neighbours' son, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Ricky, himself from a broken home as well, and Jane find they have a lot in common and eventually turn out to be soulmates.Everything about this film is so darkly clear, it is extremely obvious why the Academy loved it, and it is very obvious to see that I love it. Spacey brings Lester wildly to life in a performance reminiscent of Spacey's acting coach Jack Lemmon. Also on top form is Annette Bening, in an over-controlled performance that is just so instantly loveable. While all the attention went to these performers, it is also Thora Birch (especially), Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley and a quiet Allison Janney that manage to steal the show just as much. Sam Mendes is an excellent director, this is his first feature, and he is a British man directing an American-based film! And he won an Oscar for it! That's an amazing achievement, ditto to Alan Ball, who's script is effectively a stunner and an instant winner.The best film of 1999, the best film of the decade and for now anyways, American Beauty stands tall as the best film ever made.	5.0	A dark and stunning masterpiece.	2001-03-17	11	7	4

American Beauty was certainly one of the best ones we had seen in a long time. We try to make it a rule and try to avoid the hype and the critics as much as we can so we can really form our own opinion when we see a movie. Well this one is a masterpiece. It is one of the few movies that actually succesfully joined comedy with drama. It all depends on how you look at things. I above all love the brutal honesty on how this film portraits the background of a so called picture perfect family. Kevin Spaceys performance is incredible and so is the rest of the cast's. If you are prudish this certainly is not a movie for you, even though I personally do not find it sexually offensive, but instead honestly refreshing. The musical score is by far one of the best I have heard in a long time too.	5.0	One of the best movies in a long time!	2000-11-12	0	0	0

But before long you find out what's behind this perfect fassade of Lester: he is very frustrated with his life: his wife (Carolyn) and daughter (Jane) don't think much about him, for them he is a loser. And also in his job he isn't content.But he also knows that it isn't never to late to change your life. When he notices Jane's friend Angela at the basketball game of the school dancing for the cheerleaders he begins to have day dreams. His impulse to change his life becomes more an more. He falls into a mid-life crisis: He quits his job, sells his car and buys a firebird, smokes dope, and sells burgers at a fast food restaurant.Lester Burnham fantasizes about Angela among the rose petals. But to make a real rose garden (or a real family life) grow, fantasizing is not enough. And he will soon learn that the ultimate freedom comes at the ultimate price.His wife Carolyn also appears to be living the dream.She works in her beautiful garden with her beautiful clothes and has talks with her neighbour about her roses.But career and appearance is the most imporant for her. So the changes in her husbands life doesn't delight her. But after a time also she begins to discovers herself after a affair with her work rival Buddy,and takes gun-shooting.Their daughter, Jane , thinking that both have gone completely off the deep end, finds understanding at the boy next door, Ricky Fitts.But if you think that the Birlings have problems , you have to meet Ricky's parents, the Fitts!""American Beauty"" is a wonderful film because it helps one to understand the many underlying emotions that people have in suburban America.

I was excited to see his transformation from someone emotionally dead to someone who was a force to be reckoned with. I was equally saddened and somewhat shocked to see his tragic end. I don't necessarily agree with the methods he used to achieve his transformation, but all he wanted back was the sort of ""white picket fence"" life. He yearned again for a time when things at least seemed simpler. No one heard him! They only bullied him or degraded him! While I can appreciate each actor's incredible ability to capture the essence of their characters, I have to say I was very disturbed to see how terribly dysfunctional everyone was. I suppose in this day and age we've come to expect and even accept things in movies that challenge the norm and question traditional values: lifestyle choices, families torn apart, drug use, etc., and then we hail them as artistic wonders.  It seems to me these characters were played to the extreme. I can only hope that's the case, because if this is what Hollywood thinks goes on in ""real life"", it should think again.  There are a lot of ""traditional"" people out there with stories to be told that can be equally as affecting and entertaining."	3.0	Good study of humanity	2001-04-26	4	3	1

We see these people that hate each other, and it makes us feel better about our life, makes us strive to do better and overcome these problems these people are having that we might also have. We will look at our lives,  and from now on we won't wanna make the mistakes that Lester did. The point  is,  Lester changed his life: in the process, it made him feel completely  better about himself, he felt new and revitalized, wreckless abandonment  was his.  What he tried to tell us is that, his old life wasn't so bad, he  just never realized how &quot;beautiful&quot; it actually was, he was too  busy complaining and being unhappy about it. So this movie isnt as bad as  most of you naive people say it is,it's not even remotely close, you just  didnt &quot;look closer&quot;.	5.0	Don't know what the &quot;message&quot; is?

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A18BV4O63DOWNH	"""juno2"""	It seems like my opinion on this film will differ from everyone else's, but if we all agreed, how fun would that be?Right from the opening scene, we're meant to be impressed with the camcorder image of a teenage  girl talking sullenly about murdering her  &quot;geek boy father&quot;.  Cut next to the Father, who announces that he will be dead a year from now  -- he intones this while doing something unmentionable  (on Amazon)  in the  shower.  Flashy enough for you?  When the story lacks substance, wow them  with  &quot;cleverness&quot;.  And this story, folks, does indeed lack  substance:  making middle-aged suburban angst into art is beyond even the  most scrupulous talents, I daresay.  Therefore, we're submitted to weird  tricks such as rose petals cascading from a cheerleader's blouse.  Not only  does this cheap trick waste time, it's dishonest:  why can't we see what  the Spacey character is REALLY thinking about?  In my opinion, the roses  thing is a cop-out; the film lacks the courage of its convictions; but who  wants a NC-17 rating?  No theaters screen NC-17 films, and NC-17 films  never win Oscars.Kevin Spacey, despite using all his Kevin-Spacey-Shtik  (droll expressions, world-weary murmur, et al.), is the character we most  care about, but, as I'm intimating, no thanks to him.  Considering the  ponderous denouement, his facile interpretation isn't really called for --  we need a more serious performance.  The other characters are cartoons:  The Termagant Wife, the Spooky Teenager  (there are several), the Repressed  Homosexual.To finish: despite its slick attempt at  &quot;sophistication&quot;, e.g., the Floating Trash Bag, the Rose Petals,  the Voice from the Grave, this is a very mainstream tale told in a  surprisingly average way.  Besides all that, the actors chew the scenery  (Bening's blubbering, Spacey snapping his wrists as he hands over a bag of  burgers).  All this has been done before -- I just don't know what all the  fuss is about.  &quot;American Beauty&quot;  has some merits, but it ain't  no  &quot;Lolita&quot;.	2.0	More mainstream than it thinks.	2000-03-07	49	13	36

Maybe that is what sets it above all the rest.  It could be the excellent acting, it could be the complex storyline, and it could be  the wonderful direction.  I can't decide.  I will warn you that if you do  not watch it with an open mind, you will hate it.  It is basically about a  family man who falls for one of his daughter's beautiful friends, which  eventually leads to his mid-life crisis, and ultimately his death.  I feel  comfortable telling you he dies because in the first ten minutes of the  film he tells you that he is going to (he is the narrator the entire time).

In fact, the movie  has almost nothing to do with that aspect when you stand back and ''look  closer.'' Sometimes I can't find words to describe how I feel about this  extrordinary film...and on that same point, I shouldn't be able to. The  movie is an expirience, a journey, that every person can take for himself.  One person may take it differently then another, but by no means does  should it lead to a neagative conclusion.

I mean by this that those who give this movie bad reviews are those who base it on the fact that it HAS sexual content, drug use, violence and language, all involving suburban families. Those who give it good reviews are those who see not the disturbing ways they act, but the meaning and beauty in all their actions. To anyone (teens, adults) in suburban america, this movie let's you know that you're not alone in your confusion. It helps you understand the uselessness of &quot;...a $10,000 sofa appolstered in italian silk.&quot; It helps you understand the beauty of all things.

I'm not a movie critic, just an ordinary American movie-goer. There are certain things that I look at about a movie in order to rate it. Did it make me think? Do I remember it long after I've seen it? Does it evoke a strong emotion (happy, sad, fear, etc.) Do I want to see it again and again and when doing so, do I tire of it? Is it visually stimulating? American Beauty is off the charts in each of those categories. It resonates with you long after it's over. It just simply is an absolute must-see movie. Kevin Spacey is such an incredibly gifted actor, as is Annette Benning. Kevin Spacey has the distinction of being in 2 of my top ten movies of all time box, the other being Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.

More than any film I have ever seen, the cinematography and direction give details so intricate that even the color scheme has caused heated debates amongst my group of friends.  The film has everything that makes a moviegoing experience, from a pitch-perfect cast (even the Smiley Burger drive-through woman is ideal) to the masterful lighting.  Though much has been made of the mature themes of the film, any viewer who has handled The Usual Suspects (another Spacey masterpiece) or The Silence of the Lambs can appreciate American Beauty for the, well, beauty that it is.The DVD provides some insight into the fascinating cinematography, but focuses more on the cast and direction.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A24CR8A2K47DMV	K. Carter	American Beauty is the unfortunate epitome of life in many suburban families.  A bunch of middle-class individuals worshiping the almighty dollar instead of worrying about family stability and moral values.  Foolishly thinking that once they have moved out of the city and have achieved a certain tax bracket, that all of life's problems will evaporate.  Just watch the evening news or read the newspaper...or look around most neighborhoods.  The families in American Beauty are not the stretched imagination of some Hollywood writer...those characters are based on what anyone can see, any day of the week.  A narrow-minded homophobic father who berates his only child every chance he gets - driving the kid to the very edge.  A miserable middle-aged man discontent with his job and his marriage - seeking affection from young girls to recapture his lost youth.  A middle-aged woman obsessed with money and status -seeking physical gratification as a substitute for other disappointments in life. Who, with any good sense can still say that American Beauty is a Hollywood farce?  The characters in this movie were desperate to find something, anything to fill their voids.  How many people make all the right decisions for all the wrong reasons?  The cast of American Beauty and Sam Mendes deserve all the accolades that were bestowed upon them (and more).  Hey, wake up...the truth does hurt - but sometimes pain has to precede the healing process.

Check out the fantastic Aussie film from 1987, BLISS, (directed by Ray Lawrence) and you will see how AB is a weak, mixed-up reworking (from a writer who cut his teeth in TV sitcoms). The very last scene of AB is the true tip-off to the reality of the rip-off, compare the camera's heavenwards pullback and Spacey's final voiceover monologue. The lovely poetry of BLISS' last scene will, if you have even a vague pulse, bring real soul-tears to your eyes.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ACV35SEOG56CY	Kelly	Look closer... at what?  With all of the aclaim that _American Beauty_ has gotten, I was really expecting a great movie, complete with moving characters, a profound message, and a story line to stay with you long after the movie is over.  Most of these things are in _American Beauty_, except there is one glaring hole... the story line is sick and contrived making life seem like a whole soap opera-ish mess.  Kevin Spacey's character starts the movie by telling us he's dead.  This is a surprise, not many movies are told from the grave.  Then we are taken to the shower scene where Spacey's Lester Burnham is &quot;saying hello to his monster.&quot;  In Lester's own words, it goes downhill from there (he may be talking about his day, I'm talking about the movie).  Lester's family is a complete wreck.  He's a wimp, his wife's an overzealous realator who's hopelessly miserable, and their daughter, Jane is the only normal person in the house.  She's a teenager going through the most aweful time of her life, so, needless to say, she doesn't help the family atmosphere too much.  Life gets a little more interesting for Les when he discovers his daughter's friend, Angela, and starts lusting after her.  Some say he falls in love, and I wonder where they got this idea.  Anyway, the movie goes on and on, Les drooling over Angelina, Jane falling in love with the interesting drug dealer next door, and Annet Benning's character finding that the way to wind down after a long day at work is to go to the shooting range and fire off a couple of rounds.  There was no point to the story line.  Most of the movie just depicts suburbia as a miserable place where no one is ever happy, and when they are, they are wishing they could screw a girl young enough to be their daughter.The only, ONLY, redeeming thing about this movie is the message about beauty in our world.  The drug dealer next door sure got it right, but I really hope that there's not a message going out that the only way you'll really see beauty is if you're constantly high and you have a camera glued to your eye.  Seriously though, the filming the dead bird because it was &quot;beautiful&quot; was very touching and that will probably stay with you for at least a little while.  Probably the best part of the movie was that short scene with the little plastice bag dancing in the breeze.  If _American Beauty_ had focoused more on the beauty in the world then on the hate of one strange little town, it definitely would have been five star material.All the actors and actresses were wonderful and really fulfilled their roles well.  And, the tiny message snuck in about beauty was wonderful.  However, all of these things did not make up for the strange and extremely lacking plot line.  If there had been something to care about and people that were interesting, _American Beauty_ would have been much better.  Save your money and your time.  If you wnat a message about true beauty, open your eyes a little more... this movie is not the way to get it.  If you think that way, I really feel sorry for you.	2.0	There was a good message somewhere, but...	2000-11-18	24	11	13
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AWB461P2S1BVT	Kelly Nance	"American Beauty is one of my all time favorite movies. ( If you've never seen this you might not want to read this.  I give away the ending. )  From the first shot of a suburbian street in the fall, which is also the last thing we see, to the look on Kevin Spacy's face after he was shot.  The look is such a look of contentment, a look of peace.Lester Burnham as he puts it "" have been living in a coma for 20 +/- years.""  From an outsiders perspective he, his wife Carolyn and their daughter Jane live the perfect suburian life.  They have the nice house with the white picket fence, a well manicured lawn, and beautiful roses.  At a closer look we see that their life is  far from perfect.  Lester and his wife don't talk, Carolyn is bitter and cold towards him and a little towards her daughter.  "" Janie honey are you trying to look unattractive."" "" Yes"" ""Congragulations you've suceeded admirably.""  Carolyn is very wrapped up in her career and is very hard on herself when she doesn't meet her goals. Jane is like any other teenager, angry and confused.  She is saving up money for a breast augmentation, we see her breasts later in the movie and they are pleanty big.  She hangs out with a girl named Angela Hayes who is a ""model"" or so she likes to think, who says she has done something with a lot of guys we find out later that that isn't true.Move next door to the Fitz's house.  The father Col. Frank Fitz rules his house with an iron fist.  His wife is spaced out throughout the entire movie.  It took me awhile to recognize her as Allison Janney.  The actions of her are in no doubt a reaction to the likely abuse she suffered from her husband.  Their son Ricky has recently been released from a mental hospital.  He sells pot behind his father's back and makes quite a lot of money doing it.  He covers for this by having a job as a cater waiter.  Ricky is required to give his father a urine sample every 6 months to make sure he stays clean.  One night Ricky smokes with Lester at a realator dinner, and that night his father asks him for a urine sample.  Never fear, Ricky is very crafty.  One of his clients is a nurse in a piediatrics office and she gives him clean urine samples.Lester and Carolyn go to Jane's school to watch her performance on the dance team and that is where Lester meets Angela Hayes.  She does something to captivate him and make him feel more alive than he has in years. He falls in lust with her.  She too thinks he is rather cute and wouldn't mind screwing him, if he worked out a little.  Lester hears this and immeadiatly starts to work out.  Life at Lester's work is no bed of roses either.  He is required to write up a report as to why he is a valuable member of the team and he writes up one saying how much he hates his job.  He is of course fired, but he was happy because he wanted to get a job with the least amount of responsibilty possible.  He sells his car and buys his dream car a 1970 Pontiac Firebird.  He now speands his days working out, smoking pot, and working at a fast food place.  This really pisses off Carolyn and she finds comfort in her buisness competition Buddy Kane , "" The Real Estate King.""  She finds he has all the same buisness ideas and policies that she does and begins to have an affair with him.  This makes Carolyn become  more alive than she seems to have been any other time.  It's funny that in order for this husband and wife to feel more alive they had to cheat on their spouse or dream of cheating on their spouse.Lets go back next door and see what is up with the Fitz's.  Ricky and Jane have started to become an item and Ricky shows her the "" most beautiful thing I have ever filmed"" a plastic bag was caught in a windstorm with a bunch of leaves.  I will say that the video was pretty amazing.  One night Lester beeps Ricky because he ran out of pot. Ricky says he is going over to give Jane her geometry book.  Col.Frank suspects that something is up and goes to the window that looks into the Burnhams garage.  He sees Lester and Ricky in there and it looks like Ricky is doing something to Lester when actually he is rolling a joint for him.  This enrages Frank and when Ricky gets home he yells at him and tells him to get out.  "" I'd rather you be dead than a f****** faggot""  Ricky leaves without a problem he has gained quite a substansial income from all the drug dealing. Frank is upset and goes to Lester's garage and kisses him.  You can see here that Frank had some underlying homosexual tendancies.  Ricky goes to Jane and asks her to go to New York with him.  Angela is at Jane's house at the time and they have a fight about her dad and Jane leaving with Ricky.  Angela goes downstairs and cries, Lester comes in and talks to her.  Angela says she wants to sleep with him and they almost do until Angela admits that she is a virgin.  Lester stops and makes her a sandwhich and asks her if Jane is happy.Angela leaves to go to the bathroom, and Lester sits down at table and looks at a picture of Carolyn at a carnival.  We then see a gun barral pointed at the back of Lester's head the camera moves to the wall and we hear a shot and see blood spattered on a wall.  We hear a monolouge by Lester and find out that Frank Fitz killed him, because he didn't want him to tell anyone that he had kissed him.This was an amazing movie.  The feeling that I got from the movie was that we have to look closer at things because they aren't always what they seem.  We also need to relax, breathe, and take a look around at all the beauty that is in the world.  "" I guess I should be pretty pissed off at what happend to me, but it is hard to stay mad when there is so much beauty in the world."""	5.0	I rule!!	2004-10-24	9	5	4

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1OBJ2263JCK5	Kenneth M. Gelwasser	In 1999 the Academy Awards folks finally got things right by giving it's top awards to the film, &quot;American Beauty&quot;. This definitely was the best movie put out that year. A modern classic in the making. In this era of Hollywood blockbusters, where special effects and noise seem to take precedence over well written sripts and acting, it is a true pleasure to find such an articulate, meaningful and well made film. This is the story of an upper middle class family, who's lives are turned upside down, when outsiders seperately come into their world. A father, mother and a teenage daughter all experience emotional awakenings and transformations, that later will have strong repercussions on thier lives.In the end this is a film about finding beauty and happiness in this world. Alan Ball (of HBO's &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;) has written a brilliant script which seems to make you want to laugh and cry at the same time.Director Sam Mendes has pulled off an audacious debut which skillfully brings this story to life.The acting in this film is first rate. Kevin Spacey is fantastic as Lester Birnaum, a man who is just waking up to life. Equaly great is Annettte Bening as his materialistic wife. West Bentley and Thora Birch, who play the teenage lovers, are a real find. I predict both these talented young actors will have very successful careers. As a whole, this is very well packaged and good looking DVD, which is loaded with extras.My favorite of them is the excellent commentary track that director Sam Mendes provides, about the making of the movie.This DVD is well worth your while.	5.0	&quot;So Much Beauty In this World that it Hurts&quot;	2001-09-05	4	1	3

Kevin Spacey (again) performs incredibly, and so does the rest of the cast, including Annette Bening and all of the younger actors.It's a  perfect mix of drama and comedy, and not as if the movie wasn't already  very impressive, this is also director Sam Mendes feature directing  debut.The film definitely was worth the 5 Oscars it was given at this  year's Academy Awards -- it might even have gotten another one for the  soundtrack, which is brilliantly composed by Thomas Newman.	5.0	Great movie - Definitely worth the Oscars!	2000-03-31	7	6	1

It contains love, lust, anger, craziness, murder, and mayhem all in one entire package.  Kevin Spacey is brilliant in a role that was made for  his talent.  Annette Benning is just as good as a crazy housewife.  American Beauty is one of those films that will be remembered because of  it's content, and in my opinion should be rated as one of the 100 best  films of all time!

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2WXRJMZU7A5ZR	Kevin McBride	I always enjoy reading the reviews of controversial books and films.  The ones that entertain me the most are those in which the reviews claims that those who enjoyed the movie are demented, that any sane or intelligent person would have hated the film, that the true intelligentsia would despise it.Naturally, American Beauty got quite a few such reviewers.  I humbly disagree with them.This movie is, in my opinion, sheer genius.  I was captivated by Kevin Spacey's opening monologue, and hardly blinked throughout the rest of the film, except to blink back tears during Spacey's closing speech.  The music is almost hypnotic; the pacing is perfect.  Scenes are as beautiful as paintings, and symbolism is rife.  I've watched the movie five times now, and haven't tired of it.  There's always something more to discover, another layer of meaning to be unraveled.The acting is not perfect.  I agreed with the Academy's decision not to give Annette Bening the Oscar; and while Kevin Spacey was brilliant, the three adolescents all had &quot;off&quot; moments.  But this is such a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.  I was so captivated by the overall impact of the film that I didn't even notice until a later viewing.Borrow it, rent it, or buy it.  This is a must-see.	5.0	American Masterpiece	2001-01-02	5	1	4

It could also be described as a film about beauty, ugliness, emptiness, pain, and so many feelings and emotions that people of all generations feel, that it can relate to almost everyone. Spacey and Bening Jr. are electric on the screen. They brought a radiance and energy to the script that few others could have pulled off.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AO461REE0KA4J	keviny01	Well, the film doesn't move me as much as I thought it should.  It begins nicely with moments of black comedy that bring the great 1989 film  &quot;War of the Roses&quot; to mind.  But it gets more and more somber and  ponderous towards the end.  The performances are an odd mixture: Annette  Benning, Kevin Spacey, and Mena Suvari are energetic and satirical, while  Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper are so low key and deadened it seems  they belong in a different movie.  The various scenes involving voyeurism,  teenage drug use, homophobia, would-be patricide just don't come together  in a cohesive, meaningful whole.  In the end, the film, like the characters  in it, simply gropes around for a resolution.  The film does have brilliant  performances by Benning and Spacey, and some memorable dialogs (&quot;Our  marriage is just a commerical for telling people how normal we are&quot;).  But a tighter and more focused narrative, and more satire and irony  throughout would yield better results.	3.0	Moments of brilliance but lack of focus	2000-08-10	4	2	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L	"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip"""	Could be the best movie of 1999- And there were a lot of great ones last year. I will also say something even (possibly) bolder--that Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career. And all us movie geeks know that is  saying a LOT, given this  man's past roles, and his talent. I used to think  he was overrated as an actor. Then I figured OK, I see what all the fuss is  about. Now, he's up there with my favorite actors of all time, with James  Woods, Steve Buscemi, Robert Deniro...probably in the top 5. I was lucky  enough to see a free screening last September and boy, am I glad I had the  privilege...it's one of those movies that blows you away so much that you  have trouble even putting your feelings into words.  I rented it over the  weekend and loved it just as much upon second (and 3rd, and 4th, and 5th)  watchings. The plotline sounds trite when you first describe it (it did to  me when I first heard about it), Spacey plays a man who describes himself  as a loser, with Bening as his horrible, shrewish, self-absorbed, pathetic  b*tch of a wife. His daughter is not all that likeable either, despite the  fact that you can understand why she  turned out this way, with her as a  mother. Just when you think you've met the most dysfunctional family in  the world outside of &quot;Happiness&quot;, you find out about the family  who just moved in next door. At first, the  strange son seems like the most  messed-up member of their brood, but after you get to meet his ex-military,  abusive, homophobic, terrifying father and his withdrawn, sad, headcase  mother, you realize he  is the most normal member of the household by far.  Then, the filmwriters toss in Kevin Spacey's lustful obsession with his  daughter's sexkitten cheerleader friend, which trust me, is a lot more fun,  entertaining,  and amusing than it sounds when you read about it. Soon, he  is having the most entertaining, hilarious midlife crisis ever seen in the  history of cinema. He just doesn't give a ***k about what he does or says  anymore, and you only wish you could get away with doing the things he  does. I found myself laughing out loud in this movie so many times, most of  it horrified, amazed laughter at what was happening and the things that are  coming out of the character's mouths, especially Spacey's. He had at least  a dozen lines that had every member of the audience in hysterics and actual  applause and cheers.  I can't say enough good things about this movie. You  think, after the first five minutes, that you know how the movie will end.  Well, Spacey's opening narrative does give it away, but trust me, the  events unfold in a  way that you will NEVER see coming. You will swear you  can see what a character is going to do next, what  violent or  self-destructice act they will commit, but you turn out to be wrong.  Without getting too pretentious here, the movie lives up to it's  theme/tagline of &quot;...look closer&quot;. The characters are not what  they seem, up until the end, and even then they surprise you. At least two  characters  that you are POSITIVE you have figured out, do or say something  that turns all your preconceptions of them  upside down, while making your  jaw drop, and your heart ache. All the acting is stunning, but I honestly  can't imagine it being the same movie (or enjoying it as much) with anyone  but Spacey in the lead role. You will leave the movie with a smile, though,  and that is maybe what I expected least of all. Words just cannot do this  movie justice-See it for yourself.	5.0	&quot;Spec-tac-ular!&quot;	2000-05-23	6	4	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A63T5DNBZ3O3S	klingsithvamp	With so many reviews, I guess the core materials have been covered.  So, into the fray!  American Beauty was much hailed, but Ref, essentially an earlier concept of the same movie, went unrecognized, due to its comedic classification.  The Ref utilized some of the same cast members, whose performance there, I felt, was superior.  Despite the show's sometimes goofy presentation, the issues and emotions had far more depth than the later release.  Too, Beauty had a preachy quality, telling you how to live your life.  The Ref, doesn't really tell you how; it just says you can't control everything that happens to you - deal with it.  Furthermore, Beauty had a flitty feel (perhaps a result of the repetitious musical cues), simply inhanced by one-dimensional characters, who never really connect.  The Ref's characters are very similar, on a basic level; and yet, they not only connect, they clash painfully.  Even the insignificant townsfolk have layers of unexplored realism.  These people are forced to confront their issues, to learn and grow.  Beauty's people, on the other hand, seem to drift even further into their own isolated misery, spiting the movies intended message.  Leary's role in The Ref is multi fold.  Primarily, he is the catalyst of change and the voice of chaos - little effort on his part.  Ultimately, while his humor may have removed the film from any Oscar contentions, it also gives the viewer a much needed stress release valve.  The drama there is so intense, you get the idea that this family would happily choke the life out of each other.  When (like me) Leary goes off on a rant, anger is displaced with negative jocularity, creating an antithetical surrealism.  It's like being comforted by the fact that your buddies laugh at you for doing something stupid. The &quot;ref&quot; both makes and breaks the movie.  I will concede this however; had I not seen The Ref, my opinion of American Beauty would be higher.  You know how it is; everything is relative - good is only good until there is something better (but in this case, better came first).	3.0	Beauty - vs. - Ref	2004-02-03	1	0	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ACMLOQ9U1VIAA	"""kls13"""	I think I'm one of the few people who thinks that this movie wasn't deserving of all of the hype that it got.  There were countless better movies released last year (Fight Club, Dogma, Being John Malkovich,  Magnolia, to name a few).  Was it a good movie?  Yes, absolutely.  Was it  the best movie ever and deserving of the Oscar?  No way.  It's the same  dried up story line--yes, the actors were brilliant, the screenplay was  great, and the movie was very funny in parts, but it wasn't anything that  we've never seen before.  Kevin Spacey's obsession with his daughter's  friend was much more disturbing to me than than the violence in Fight Club.  When I went to see this movie, I fully expected to love it, but instead I  just thought it was sort of okay.  I felt like they were trying to cram  every single issue on the face of the earth into two and a half  hours--adultery, unhappy marriage, drug use, teenage sex, job unhappiness,  etc.  It felt like too much to me, and ended up feeling forced.  I gave  this movie four stars, because I did think that it was good, but I didn't  think that it was great, and certainly not worthy of all of the attention  that it got.	4.0	Not worth all the hype	2000-05-14	4	3	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3K1LK6DJCVPUK	K. Palmer	I bought the awards edition of American Beauty, which contains one tape with the movie itself and a second tape that shows a 20 minute &quot;Making of A.B&quot; show with interviews with the director, producer and cast and then a one hour show where director Sam Mendes goes through storyboards about the making of the film, also bringing in his cinematographer for commentary.I really can't add much to the reviews of the many people who liked this movie.  This movie is great because people can relate to Lester and Carolyn and their feelings.  I definitely can see myself writing a similar &quot;how I contribute&quot; letter to my company that Lester did.  My wife could definitely see herself as getting obsessed over material things and how things look like Carolyn does.  So it really is an eye opener in that respect.  There were some things that I just didn't get (the video of the bag in the wind, Ricky's catatonic mother), but the performances of Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning more than overshadow these flaws.I will say that if you can get through the bonus second tape, you'll probably only do it once.  The &quot;Making of&quot; show was OK but nothing special, but I could only tolerate about 10 minutes of Sam Mendes' commentary on the story boards.  If you are a budding moviemaker, you may want to watch it, but if you could care less to hear for five minutes why he chose to show a wide shot of Lester's office before he actually showed Lester at his desk early in the movie, I'd stop, hit the rewind button and put it back in its box forever.  I would have preferred to see some deleted footage instead (even if it only was 10 minutes worth).	5.0	Great Movie, but the Second Tape is a Waste of Space	2000-11-01	0	0	0

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2Q07KQAAFWVL7	Kristoffer Infante	Among my collection of 43 Oscar-winning Best Picture films (from &quot;All About Eve&quot; to &quot;West Side Story&quot;), I have to say that &quot;American Beauty&quot; (which has been in my collection for two months before it comes out on VHS and DVD) is an excellent ode to fathers who are very unhappy. It takes a sort of satiric look at how our lives really are. We all can identify with most of the characters. We laugh and cry, we think and sympathize, we remember and never forget. In the cases of Lester and Carolyn Burnham (Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening), Robin Hood Trail's &quot;unordinary&quot; ordinary couple, we see their once happy union crumble before our eyes. Their daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), a sad, alienated girl with no happiness in her life. She takes comfort in her oversexed, but obviously ordinary friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) and her voyeuristic, drug dealing boyfriend Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley, a very boring actor!). In the house next door is the Fitts family; Marine Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper) and Barbara Fitts (Alison Janney), along with son Ricky. When everyone's secrets, which is the climax of the film, is revealed, they are all affected by it. Which leads to Lester being shot dead by Colonel Fitts, who is really a latent homosexual; Carolyn's only chance at happiness with her lover, fellow real estater Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) is destroyed when Lester discovers them fooling around, literally; Jane and Angela are no longer friends; Jane decides to run away with Ricky, who is thrown out of his house by his abusive father. This film obviously affected many critics and people as well; enough to garner five Oscars for Picture, Director, Actor, Screenplay, and Cinematography. This is definitely a film that is among the great tragicomedies such as &quot;The Apartment,&quot; &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; and &quot;Terms of Endearment.&quot; To make us laugh and cry is an amazing accomplishment which, lucky for these four films, they have done with precision and taste.	5.0	A Beauty-ful film	2000-10-22	1	0	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AHMVKXEGSNYEF	kw	"Spacey, the actor or the way someone feels while watching the movie American Beauty?  Kevin Spacey is phenomenal in his portrayal of Lester Burnham in Sam Mendes' film American Beauty.  While American Beauty portrays the story of an average family man having a mid-life crisis, it does not succeed in portraying the average American family.  The American family is only represented in the movie through materialistic aspects.  These aspects include the suburban neighborhood, the family car, and the house with the white picket fence.  The values, customs, way of life, and love of the ""family"" is not represented in this movie.  I feel that American Beauty succeeds in showing the life of one family out of thousands, but it is not a good representation of every American family.In the beginning of the film the viewer is introduced to Lester Burnham (Spacey).  He is a middle aged man working at an ad agency and his wife Carolyn (Annette Benning) is a middle aged woman working for her own real estate firm.  Together they have a daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), who is in high school. The Burnham's are unhappy with their lives but do not show it to the outside world, until one day when Lester is introduced to Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), Jane's friend.  After meeting her Lester's mid-life crisis begins.  He quits his jobs, buys the car he's always wanted, starts smoking pot, and starts to work at a burger joint.  Carolyn can not believe what her husband is doing because it is messing up her ""perfect life.""  Also included in this messed up sort of world are the Fitts'.  Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper) is the militant father that every son, who's not athletic, is afraid of and his wife Barbara Fitts (Allison Janney) is a woman in a deep depression.  Their son Ricky (Wes Bentley) is rebellious and at times creepy.  He starts to obsess over Jane and over her father, too.  These two families go through the trials and tribulations of dealing with a hippie and militant father, a cheating and depressed mother, a depressed daughter, and a rebellious son.The movie tends to drag in places and does not keep the viewers interest.  He or she can start to space out and not pay attention to what is going on, but if this happens then once the viewer comes back to the movie he or she is lost in what's going on.  There seems to be a sort of fog throughout the movie as well.  The viewer seems to be left out of some important information and it makes it hard to understand what is happening.  If one thing is missed such as one statement or one line, he or she can be lost the rest of the movie.  This though can relate back to the Burnham family.  It seems that some of the family members are being left out of certain talks and happenings too.  They too do not know what's going on within their family.  Also, the editing of the movie seems to jump around a lot.  It gets confusing when Ricky and Jane are talking after school, and then when Ricky comes home in the next scene it is late at night and he is in totally different clothes.  His father doesn't seem to realize that it is late at night and his mother says nothing.  She just sits and stares at the TV.  This can be taken as a representation of how the Fitts family operates.  Many families do have their dysfunctional aspects, and the Fitts family is confusing to follow and all together they are confused themselves.  If this is taken into account, many families in America are not this dysfunctional or confused.  Yes, there may be some contradicting comments and confusing talks between family members but none as confusing and out of place as the previous example.  There also seems to be a lack of finding the beauty in America.  Rather then seeing beauty in obvious ways, the viewer is made to guess where the beauty is to be found in a scene.  This beauty can be the rose petals, the film editing, the setting of the neighborhood and the house, or the face that is seen on Lester Burnham's face in his last scene.  It all depends on what the observer sees as beautiful.  If the viewer really pays attention and can think about what's going on they will enjoy this movie.  It is definitely a movie for someone that likes to sit and analyze the meanings behind certain statements or occurrences.  This movie really does make you ""look closer.""In choosing my two other reviews on this movie, I decided to go for ones that I totally agreed with and totally did not agree with.  The first review was by a common man.  It tells all about the family's problems, the tribulations that they face, and the response of each family member to the happenings of the family.  He does a very good job in adding his opinion about the movie, and not pushing anyone to think the same way as him.  The best part of his review is when he quotes Ricky as saying ""never underestimate the power of denial.""  This is so true throughout the entire movie, too.  Frank Fitts denies that people are gay, denies that his son has a pot problem, and denies that anything is wrong with his family.  By not believing all of these problems, Frank helps to prove that this is not the average American family.  This review also talks about how well the film is put together.  I feel the same way about this, except for a few editing errors.  But those errors are necessary to create a good movie that flows and hits all the main points needed.  For my disagreeing review, I did not feel that it was an ""American Snapshot.""  I also did not feel that the words he used were appropriate.  Lester Burnham was not a schmuck.  He was a man going through a hard time in his life.  Many men feel this way during their older years, and to call them a schmuck is an insult.  I also did not agree with the fact that he calls Carolyn Burnham a ""money grubbing soulness phoney.""  Yes, throughout the movie it may seem as though she does not give a damn about what is happening to her family, but in all reality she does.  Her compassion and soul are seen when she wants the best for herself and her daughter.  They are also seen at the very end of the movie when she goes into her bedroom, grabs Lester's clothes and begins to sob.  If this isn't compassion, then I don't know what is.  I also do not agree that the entire world is narcisstic, obsessed with looks or toys.  Yes, many Americans may be obsessed with these things, but to say that the entire world is this way is wrong.  These reviews help to explain two very different views on this movie.Whether, someone likes this movie or does not all depends on how they look at it.  American Beauty can be seen as a heartwarming, true tale of a mid-life crisis or it can be seen as a distasteful representation of the ""American family"" and the ""American dream.""  It all depends on the viewer.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  So is it the meaning that matters? Or the content in which the beauty is displayed?"	3.0	Beauty?	2006-04-09	5	2	3

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AZ32H4KCYUDWX	Laurel	Traditionally the intent of movies was an escape from everyday life and in turn, to take focus off the ordinary life leaving the audience happy.  From my understanding, some audience members were upset over the revealing,  controversal content that left some in shock.  But it's about time a movie  portrays life as more than a frolick through the woods and gets down to the  hidden, even dark issues behind the closed doors. The movie dissects  suburbia life using comedy, drama, and sadness.  The Burnham family is the  family of focus as the father, Kevin Spacey, re-discovers the feeling of  life and joy and guards his new happiness, without a care, until his  unpreventable downfall.  The humor begins the day Lester(the father) speaks  and does exactly what he's thinking, with no regard to manners or the  responses from others.  His wife, Carolyn, without the usual control, goes  into a frenzy that adds to her self-inflicted stress and havic until she  looses it...Meanwhile, the teenage daughter, Jane, seeks out a new  companion while attempting to cope with the parents and home life she  dispises.  New to the screen, Wes Bentley(Ricky), shares his mysterious  thoughts with Jane. He shows Jane the life and beauty behind things and how  we're all surrounded with beauty but we never take the time to appreciate  it. One such scene involves the filming of a bag and Ricky's breathtaking  words of the bag's movement. NO JOKE, this scene rubbed off onto my mind  and soul and left me with tears of joy and compassion as this character's  undescribable recollection of abundance of beauty was made known. I beg one  and all to experience this movie, if only for the magic contained in this  small scene. What can I say-- this movie is a gem of great value and we all  have the chance to see it and take a piece of it with us as we continue our  own journey.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1TLAI6EANEJH3	Lauren	I never saw this movie in the theaters.  My friends who saw it raved about it, but they warned me that they left the theater bawling.  They said they sat in silence after the credits rolled, stunned by what they had seen. So  I never saw it.  I thought a film that intense should be viewed in your own  home.  No one wants to spend their Friday night out feeling emotionally  drained.  So I rented it.  And when the credits rolled, I was smiling. Many  people have called this film overly dark or depressing.  I think that these  people are missing the point, or at least the point I got from it.  Sure,  at first glance, the tagline &quot;look closer&quot; may seem to refer to  the underlying dysfunction in most cheery suburban homes.  But if you look  again, you'll realize, as Lester did, that there is even beauty in the  dysfunction.  All the drugs, and affairs and pseudo-child pornography never  made Lester as happy as he was in that final moment, and though it was cut  short, he was greatful to have had it.  That is a wonderful message.  If  you were hesitant to see this film, as I was, because of all the &quot;dark  comedy&quot; hype and four hanky warnings, give it a shot.  This movie is  different things to different people and you may find yourself pleasantly  surprised.	5.0	Feel good comedy of the year!  Sort of...	2000-05-10	1	0	1

All, however, will be forever haunted by it.I doubt that  there is a person alive who could not relate to at least one of the  beautifully crafted characters, which included everything from a  success-driven consumer wife, to a helpless man on the brink of an  awakening, to a constant observer who finds himself burdened by the  splendid beauty of the world.  This film is so simple due to its portrayal  of seemingly ordinary life, yet so involved at the same time due to the  fact that nothing is as it seems.  In this way, the film creates a metaphor  for life itself, which seems to be quite plain and simple, yet is anything  but.  There are no ordinary things, nor are there ordinary people, and when  a person looks closer, they will find that there is beauty in everything.  This message is one that will stay with the viewer, despite their opinion  of the film.	4.0	Interesting	2000-08-08	3	2	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2CGDXA6LPRRRE	L. Crowe	"The tagline of Sam Mendes' American Beauty is ""...look closer,"" and the film itself urges viewers to do just that - to question their own judgements of others.  Its characters demonstrate that people are not always what they appear to be, and this contrast between expectation and reality is one of the driving forces behind the film's message and its powerful emotional effectiveness.  The central characters are not perfect - they each engage in behavior that some would consider reprehensible - but they are not bad people.  They are all sympathetic in one way or another, despite their faults, and this conflict makes them deeply and beautifully human.American Beauty is set in a suburban neighborhood during the 1990s.  Its central focus is Lester Burnham, a middle-aged husband and father, and the consequences of his epiphanic awakening from the emotional torpor brought on by his humdrum job and his stagnant relationship with his family.  Due to his behavior following his epiphany, the lives of Lester and his family, friends, and neighbors become entangled, and this entanglement leads ultimately to Lester's second epiphany - a sudden realization of inner peace - and, immediately afterward, his murder.All of the players in the drama of Burnham's life have flaws; all of them make poor decisions.  However, I would like to focus on the qualities of two characters in particular:  Carolyn Burnham and Frank Fitts.  If someone were to argue that this film had ""villains,"" these two would probably be the most likely candidates. Carolyn is apparently cold and emotionless, unfriendly towards her husband and abusive towards her daughter.  Frank harbors a violent, vitriolic hatred and resentment of gay people, and is abusive towards his son.  However, the film gives us a few brief insights into the emotional and mental states behind their behavior, and these closer looks at their psyches betray them as damaged individuals to be pitied rather than reviled.  It is difficult to think of Carolyn as a heartless villainess when we see scenes of her crying alone, reprimanding herself for showing emotion, unable to seek comfort by sharing her misery with anyone else; or when she clutches the clothes in her murdered husband's closet and screams with anguish and remorse.  Similarly, Frank, with all of his hatred and brutality, is still an object of pathos - it is heart-wrenching to see his shuffling, stumbling, sobbing exit into the rain after he reveals his secret to Lester.  Both of these scenes cause one to imagine the miserable lives of concealment and self-loathing these characters have been leading.  As much as I had been led to hate Frank and Carolyn, at these moments, all I could do was pity them - they became, in my eyes, individuals in need of serious help, not hatred and retribution.The story of American Beauty does not have villains and heroes - it has humans. By cultivating sympathy for even the most apparently flawed individuals, Mendes calls upon simple human kindness, and encourages us to rethink our initial evaluations of the people around us.  Perhaps it is na?ve to say that films like this one have the power to make the world a better place.  But I believe that if everyone took the example of American Beauty, and looked closer - at the faces of criminals in the newspapers, at people they saw on the street, and even at close friends whom they were sure they had figured out - they would gain a better understanding of their neighbors, and a greater capacity for sympathy and kindness.  From now on, I will look closer."	4.0	Look Closer	2006-04-05	2	1	1

I liked Kevin Spacey's  performance, except for his idiotic monologue at the end.  This is one of  those movies that make me talk back to the screen, with insulting remarks.  Move it along, director!  Shoddy work can't be excused by inventive plot  twists.  Yes, it's politically correct to dislike the ex-marine who smacks  his kid around, collects guns, and is a hard nose, and sure it's easy to  take the cheap shot at this caricature and call him a closet queen.  You  may think this is cutting edge, but I think it's just a cheap shot at an  obvious target.  I couldn't stand the movie before most of this happened,  so my dislike goes deeper than just this.

Obviously we are dealing with a perverted family, but we're also dealing with a very serious message that Ball (inadvertently?) stated. The things I saw in this movie reminds me of what I see (or hear about) in the real world. It suffers from cliches at times (can't Hollywood dock the &quot;f&quot; word?) and it is not for prudes, but this movie has a fine point even though watching it is difficult. Anyway, Spacey, Benning, and Bakula are peerless here.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3HW7YZVDJE4QV	Lewis	"""American Beauty"", directed by Sam Mendes, is a drama from 1999.Unhinged by his pretentious mid-life crisis, protagonist Lester Burnham encounters the endeavor of his lifetime: finding out who he is, what he wants and basically lavishing his life by smoking pot and doing things which keep the audience in perpetual disbelief.The great acting of Kevin Spacey fades near the middle of the film, however, his daughter getting laid by the weirdo next door is the continuing exaggerated symbolization of the alleged, wannabe problems of American Society.The ludicrousness is additionally supported by the real-estate agent Carolyn - incidentally Lester's wife and mother of one -, who apparently takes success for luck and her yard for flagship of social appreciation, underlining the obtrusively obvious and self-important enlightenment of problems of western civilization.This masterpiece of a miscarried artistic tries, by hook or by crook, to push the audience into a mental status of finding the inner beauty, but unintentionally leading into a paralysis of continual boredom.Carolyn's actress is, without a doubt, a good one, totally concentrating on her duty, what shall be stated as one - amongst plenty - other reason of the movie's annoying attitude. She is just playing her character so well that there occurs a very serious problem: the character in itself.The shrieking of Carolyn Burnham is, by any means, one of the most significant misfits - unfortunately recurring every time you nearly forgot her presence.American Beauty won prizes. Plenty of prizes.Admittedly, I would have honored it with a well-known prize as well: the GOLDEN Globe - noo, just kidding - the GOLDEN RASPBERRY Award."	1.0	Ludicrous, unrealistic, miscarried.	2013-09-04	7	1	6

Frankly, I think this plot device  was too contrived.  I wish I could have just seen the story unfold  naturally.  But there was nothing natural anyway about this movie.It was  all stereotypes exaggerated to a degree that made them comical. Throw in  irreverent humor, some bold language and universal truths.The movie is a  success because the audience relates to it.  Kevin Spacey is  &quot;everyman&quot; just trying to be happy.  And so he quits his job,  lusts after his teenage daughter's friend, tells off his wife, smokes pot,  plays his favorite music and achieves the kind of success that evoke  cheers.The acting is good.  Casting is fine.  But as far as I'm  concerned, the story just didn't make it and I had to force myself to stay  interested in the characters.  I also didn't like the cinematography,  especially the dream sequences or the grainy images of videotaping which  the daughter's boyfriend, a weird but yet sympathetic character played by  Wes Bently, was obsessed with taping.Maybe it was all the hype that  turned me off.

Who is to be pitied more:  Lester, whose life is  snuffed out at the moment of pure joy and contentment, or his wife, who  buys into the mantra that one must first attain the appearance of success  in order to BE successful?  She fiercely shuts down any intense emotion  lest she be overwhelmed, and even her sexual encounters are comically  farcical.  &quot;When did you become so joyless?&quot; the soul-searching  Lester asks his wife in a touching moment.Ricky's character as the boy  next door is haunting.  He sees life as an artist and a poet; his serenity  contrasts with the stark repression of his military father and soulless  mother, and intrigues Lester's daughter Jane, who possesses Wednesday  Addams' moon face and dour disposition.  Her struggle of self-discovery  contrasts with that of her best friend, the beautiful and perfect  cheerleader Angela, whose insecurities are masked by sexual bravado.This  is a movie worth seeing . . . worth thinking about long after it's over . .  . and a gentle reminder to live life authentically.	4.0	Thought-provoking	2000-03-21	39	35	4

Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	'American Beauty' is an artistic film that uses a great deal of cinematic skill to underscore the ironies in one man's life, with the ultimate irony being that regardless of temptation, each person will be true to their ideals when faced with ultimate threats to those ideals.Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, who is fired very early in the film. Annette Bening plays his wife Carolyn. Very quickly, the stereotypes begin. One sub-theme throughout the movie is Kevin's desire for a pretty high school cheerleader. However, the real sub-theme is wanting what you can't really ever have. This same theme is repeated for each of the major characters, from Carolyn to their next-door neighbor Colonel Frank Fitts to Ricky Fitts, Frank's son, played by Wes Bentley, to Jane Burnham, Lester and Carolyn's daughter, played by Thora Birch. Each wants something they do not have. To varying degrees, each gets what they think they want, but, and this is the real moral of the movie and the story, what you think you want isn't truly what you wanted, because when you get what you want, it doesn't give you the happiness you thought you were going to get.Kevin spends much of the movie working out, buying his dream muscle car, and lusting after Angela Hayes, played by Mena Suvari. It certainly seems as though his purchases are providing him happiness. However, he is looking for the relationship he once had with his wife. In a pivotal scene in the movie, Lester and Carolyn are in the immaculate living room of their house. Lester has a beer, and begins to get somewhat amorous. Just as it looks as though something might spark, Kevin spills his beer, which causes Carolyn to be more concerned about the expensive couch than their relationship. Is this shallowness a cliche? Yes it is. However, there is more to the story than just cliches.As the story unfolds and each character seems to be making progress toward getting what they want, in many cases the scenes are set up as fantasies, which are beautifully and artfully done. I find one of the most intriguing characters to be Ricky Fitts. Ricky wants his father's unconditional love, and loves his father, but somehow you sense that he knows he'll never get it. Further, I felt that Ricky knew that eventually something bad would happen between his father and him. The sense of impending disaster that Ricky anticipates through his actions and his attitude infects the rest of the movie with the same feeling. Almost as though you were in quicksand and knew a bad end was coming, but it comes so slowly that you don't realize it until it is too late.The real beauty in the movie is at the end. While I will not reveal all the details, I will reveal important details, so if you do not want to know, I'll tell you quickly that this movie is very artsy and well-acted. If those types of movies appeal to you, you will love this one.Near the end of the movie, Lester finally has an opportunity to be with Angela. It is the very last thing Lester has wanted throughout the entire movie, that he has, up to now, been unable to get, and here he has his chance. However, there is a small problem. After Angela's top has been removed, she asks Lester to be gentle because it's her first time.What? Hasn't Angela been telling Jane Burnham throughout the movie about her sexual exploits? Yes. Here's part of the sub-theme once again. Angela in fact has wanted to have the experiences to match her bragging. Now that she has the real opportunity to have it happen, she is fearful. Lester realizes that he cannot take away Angela's innocence, and tells her to get dressed. Both realize continuing would be a mistake for both. An incredible, but very correct decision for each. The movie brilliantly puts a most incredible temptation to two people, and they both realize that getting what they thought they wanted would make neither happy.I'm not going to reveal what happens next. I admit I was surprised that Lester would resist temptation, but proud of him too. He was tested, if by no one else then by himself, and he passed. He proved that he was stronger than nearly all the other characters in the movie. Of course, this scene sets up the final irony.A brief word on symbolism. The rose is used as a part of Lester's fantasies throughout the entire movie. Remember that the rose is a symbol of many things, love and purity being only one of them.The visual beauty of this movie is used to drive home the theme. The movie is not only ironic in the way the characters and the scenes are played out; the movie is visually ironic as well. To explain that irony would require giving the ending away more than I have. One other thing: This movie does not condone 40+ men having sex with under 18 girls any more than 'Pretty Woman' romanticizes and fosters prostitution. If you believe that this movie is all about one man's fantasy with a young girl, you missed the point. Try once more and hang in there, the meaning is deeper, and subtler. However, you have to watch to the very last scene and think about the symbolism of everything you saw. This movie is truly beautiful, very well done, and an instant, very artistic classic. I would rate this movie more than 5 stars if I could.	5.0	Visually Artistic, Well Acted	2002-11-08	6	3	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2FLR6QHPXK87Z	LostSaint	Ok, first, let me start off with how disgusted I am with some of my fellow amazon reviewers for giving this movie 1 star because they thought it was too controversial. The movie is brilliant. I think from reading the reviews of other intelligent people, you already know incredible this movie really was. However, for whatever reason, whether it was because it was too blunt in the way they expressed american life or whatever it was, you must at least give kudos to the acting and cinematography. I am also surprised at how a couple of people had no cons to complain about and wrote nothing but compliments only gave the movie 4 stars. This movie deserves all the stars in the world. The man was lusting for a teenage girl... is that really that far removed from the way men really think? I also saw a reviewer put a con of the movie as &quot;the girl was weird&quot;... what the hell does that have to do with good movie making? One reviewer was right. Intelligent people find this movie outstanding. Morons find this movie &quot;horrible, too weird, yucky, ME NOT LIKE, TOO BRILLIANT FOR ME SMALL BRAIN&quot;. I'm sorry... after watching american beauty get the ratings it deserved, 1 star reviewers started popping up.. i tried to resist flaming but I just could not.Ooh by the way, get this movie! I have it, I've watched it countless times, each time no less enjoyable than the last and I still watch it.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AEFL7I22BB41J	Luciano Lupini	A portrait of a suburban, disfunctional, family in America. The plot, with dramatic and comic touches, evokes the ghosts of middle life crisis, and constitutes a fine but traumatic exploration into nothingness and what ensues when you believe that you have all programmed and covered, until real life pierces through the veil of stereotype and devoids what you took for granted of any meaningful purpose. Many self-destructive behavioural traits of modern suburban families are explored and exposed.I can think of no visual (and musical) experience as similar, in many senses, to Mike Nichol's fundamental picture The Graduate. So if you can appreciate a funny tale, told with dark touches, about consumistic materialism, modernistically troubled kids with absentminded parents, that in a way reflects your neighbour's troubles (or perhaps your domestic menage)YOU SHOULD SEE THIS PICTURE........	5.0	IS IT SURREALISM OR AN EXISTENCIALISTIC  STATEMENT?	2002-04-07	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2FNIVQU5N04F0	Luke	"I am impressed by very few scripts written in the modern era, but am I surprised by Alan Ball's script for American Beauty.  It's intelligent, wisecracking, filled with rich originality and real people with quirks and shortcomings - without making us feel distaste for them.  In fact, it scuppers the idea of what we defines as really ""beautiful"" in suburban, modern consumerism-driven America. Sam Mendes does well with the direction to be almost oblivious, and the emsemble acting is outstanding (particularly Kevin Spacey), but ultimately, its Ball's screenplay which carries the day.  The only thing I can fault here is that Ball's quasi-existentialist statements may feel a little glib at times - but, still, this movie's certainly rich entertainment for all that."	5.0	Brilliant script	2005-03-19	4	4	0

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A21O2Y5GVW94ZK	"Lyubimaya ""Zaraza"""	American Beauty is a movie about the life of an average American family (however, in this case it absolutely does not make any sense: it could be an American family, or a British family, or a Russian family, or some other family). This film is about problems which every member of this family has. The plot of the movie is plain and certainly common. Speaking frankly, the beginning of the movie produces enough dreary feelings. You may think it is the regular tearful story about a stupid husband, a stinker wife, their daughter who suffers of solitude and incomprehension, and also about their neighbors: a slight crazy guy who sells drugs and peers through a his video camera, and about his father, an ex-colonel who so extremely hates homosexuals that you begin to suspect him in his latent homosexuality. Of course, the movie shows exactly that. But it is not made like other soupy stories. It does not want to make you cry. It only tells you about lives of simply miserable people; it tells you what they feel, what they dream about and finally what happens to them.Do you know why the movie Straw Dogs with Dustin Hoffman is really scary? It is not the violence of the ending when bookworm Hoffman kills everyone. The movie is scary because there is no right or wrong. And all this blood bath happened not because some bad guy decided to commit evil, while some good would stop him. It just happened through a series of coincidences. That is scary because in real life it happens like that. BAD GUY comes rarely. More often MISERABLE comes who in return makes miserable out of you.Similar to Straw Dogs, there is no right and wrong in American Beauty. And Lester (Kevin Spacy) is not a stupid perverted dolt, but middle class man who has not achieved a lot and who could not establish a proper family where he could find love, understanding and support. And his wife Caroline (Annete Benning) is not a bitch or whore. She is just a woman who is trying to crawl on to the surface but she cannot. Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is not an evil bestial who dreams to kill her parents. She is just a little girl who suffers from misunderstanding and who is very lonely.What is a person life like if shower masturbation in the morning is the best thing that will happen to him during the day? If he wanted to be strong and cheerful, but became weak and miserable. The center of the movie is the moment that, no matter how strange it seems, corresponds American Beauty to Fight Club. That is when Lester is trying to break free from the gray reality that surrounds him. In Fight Club the main hero finds relief in communicating with terminally sick people and then gains pleasure from bloody street brawls. Lester did not go so far. He just left his well paid job and started working in McDonalds, began to exercise and use drugs. The idea is that Lester broke free. He ceased being afraid of his bitching wife. He realized that there is no point in straggling for a job you do not like. Because you can be the happiest fast-food worker or the unhappiest vice-director of some office. And when Lester broke free, he felt good. He even starts to look better.But, unfortunately such a state is not permanent. It is like remission before the impeding end. And the end arrives. Basically, the movie starts from it. Lester dies. We do not know who killed him. It can be anyone. Daughter Jane who cannot stand him and who is ashamed that her father is trying to hit on her classmate. Wife Caroline who hates her husband and thinks of him as a slug and a loser. Jane's boyfriend (who is jealous that Lester did not hit on him), Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), whom Jane is asking to kill her father. Ricky's father who is crazy about patriotism and fascism and thinks that Ricky has a sexual relationship with Lester. Everyone has reasons to kill Lester. Even Lester himself. Because all of a sudden he thinks it is too good for him to live. Why not die when you feel best? Why die when you suffer? But Ricky delivers more ideas to the movie: sex, lies, and video. He records a girl he likes, while other things get on to his line of sight. Ricky is the only one person who sees a beauty in an empty bag dancing in the wind. So, it is not considers that he becomes as the final hero of the movie.The movie is made perfect in all means. From the point of plot (the writer Alan Ball won an Oscar for the original screenplay), and from the point of the director and actors. But first at all, this movie is great because it is about us. About all us, whoever we are -- Americans, Russians, children, adults, psychos. This movie breaks all stereotypes. The naughtiest girl in the school Angela shows up a virgin, the loving family is a joke; a homophobe hides his true orientation. It looks so usual, like routine. Fates of different people merge in one crazy ball and everyone is looking for his/her beauty.p.s. sorry if I have mistakes(I am Russian))	5.0	Beauty for All	2009-11-05	4	4	0

Moreover, the one ""hero"" in the film is a drug dealer whose ""occupation"" detracted from his message of art and love.I did watch the film through to the end simply because I could not believe it could get any worse, but worse it got.  Nowadays this is considered a classic film that is studied in film courses, but in my own personal view only the technical aspects of the film are worth raving about.  As a woman and a feminist, I find the movie greatly insulting.  Sorry if anyone out there thinks me mean-spirited for this, but, that's the way I feel."	1.0	Grotesque Beauty	2004-08-31	27	6	21
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A17NVM7IAPF2NS	Maek	I am a little more than amazed at some of the BAD reviews of this film ranging from &quot;lame story&quot; to &quot;so what.&quot;Do we understand what we have here?  It's not meant to be thrilling, spine-tingling, or nail-biting action.  It's meant to take a picture of America that all of us know so well exists, and yet we deny it so vehemently to our friends.  &quot;Our marriage is fine.&quot;  &quot;We have a good, well-behaved boy.&quot;Who knows?  &quot;Look closer&quot; is a sign you find in Kevin Spacey's cubicle and I will not try to be blase in saying that it IS the overall theme in the movie, but it comes pretty close to the mark.Is everything you expect it to be?  Are American neighborhoods truly the sanctum of the &quot;decent living&quot; that we all say that it is?  No.  The opening scene with Anette Benning in the front lawn is just a simple, yet powerfully shot scene of the &quot;mask&quot; that we put on ourselves to suppress the futility we feel in our own lives.  &quot;Look closer&quot; at a mid-life crisis, a frustrated wife, a confused and underappreciated teenage girl, another teenage girl displacing sexual insecurity by being overtly sexual, and the drug-selling boy next door who so much wants to find beauty in his own life that he seeks it elsewhere--we don't often realize that everyone goes through a silent misery of pain everyday.  Stop saying &quot;I'm fine&quot; to everyone when you're not...a great deal can be accomplished if we were all a little more honest with each other.Can you not say that you can't relate to someone or yourself in this film?  I'll be 100% amazed if you can.  I, for one, can relate to the side of the &quot;disturbed-boy-next-door&quot; who sees unusual beauty in mundane, every-day situations.I would like to definitely put my 10 cents in on the final scene.  What does the boy find beautiful about Kevin Spacey in the end?  Because Kevin Spacey has finally found a frozen moment in time when everything WAS wonderful in his life--only to be frozen in eternity.Please don't listen to those who say &quot;I don't get it.&quot;  Those who don't get it probably deserve a casting role in this film, ironically.	5.0	&quot;Beautiful!&quot;	2001-05-18	6	2	4

I am torn by two contradictory  emotions. I want to weep, yet I remind myself of the expression on Kevin Spacey's face at its finale, and I want to pay him homage by smiling and rejoicing in the mysteries of life.American Beauty is simply great. If, halfway through, you think you are bored, hold your horses, because you will realize that a slow- down was needed for us to appreciate the grand finale and the wonderfully summed up ""meaning of life.""Watch this movie, my friend, and then tell all your loved ones  how much you love and appreciate them.

It has voice overs, you see, and cardinal rule one of writing movies is no voice overs.  Rule two is no voice overs.  And so on.Anyway, forget the rules.  The prose in American Beauty is stunning, the observations of small moments in American life trenchant.  No, this movie doesn't answer all the big questions, or maybe any of them.  And, yes, it does drip with a lot of silly Hollywood attitude (like the observation that those who oppose homosexuality must be closet gays, or worse).  What this movie does well is provide a snapshot into a real life (Kevin Spacey's), and gives us a lot to chew on about what passes for living in modern America.  It is, at its heart, a story about the difference between society's expectations and our inner lives.

Would we have to watch two hours of a middle aged man's pining for a teenage girl?  Then all of a sudden the clich&eacute;s came  alive and turned out to be real characters. Maybe this came about only  because one of them chose to finally say what he thought and do what he  felt like. It is quite surprising to see that a &quot;loser&quot; is no  longer a loser once he stops trying to be what he is not.It is  tremendous fun watching how the American fear of being a &quot;loser&quot;  or a &quot;deviant&quot; person is being exploded from within. Refusing to  go on with the common hipocrisy seems to be a thoroughly exhilarating  experience.

What's missing though (which is why I only gave this dvd 4 stars) is the deleted &quot;outtakes&quot; scenes that are conspicuously missing. These scenes are talked about during the commentary by Sam Mendes as if they were supposed to have been included on the dvd.

I rated the movie 1 star because that was the lowest rating I could choose. The characters were all beautiful to look at. But they treated each  other with such coldness and callousness that I found myself wondering how  they became a family in the first place. What happened to movies that  celebrated life as a family? Are there no couples who positively and  effectively communicate and stay faithful to produce movies about? Do we  not care that children want to see their parents dead? Do we not care when  a friend attempts to seduce the parent of her best friend. Is it now  acceptable for neighbors to share pot (illegal though it is)or buy it from  each other? I found no redeeming features to this movie. I have enjoyed  Annette Benning and Kevin Spacey in other movies, but I am disappointed in  this case.

See how it is when  the risk of spilling beer over a couch is more important than a romantic  kiss on the very couch. Actually, it is to me a poetic/dramatic version of  &quot;Married with children&quot;...everybody is a freak, or at least a  weirdo (apart from Kevin Spacey who seems to enjoy being straight-forward  after years of hypocrisy - big time!).

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1MC9L1QJ11X7V	Maria Esposito	This movie does what few movies do nowadays: it teaches and compels thought. Whereas most blockbusters are soon forgotten, American Beauty will be with us forever. This is one of the few movies in recent years which has deserved its awards and acclaim.It is the story of a typical middle aged man, Lester Burnham, and his dissatisfaction with his life. As Burnham rebels from societal norms, he cultivates a new appreciation for life. It is at the end of the film, when Burnham assures his daughter's friend, Angela Hayes, that she is anything but ordinary, that we realize, to many, Lester may seem ordinary, but to us he is anything but. The other powerful message, which always brings tears to my eyes, is the message about beauty in everything.All of the actors are superb in this film. There are not words to describe Kevin Spacey and the feelings that he conjures up in us. Annette Benning, although I am not a fan of hers, did what needed to be done and, I guess acts well enough to always make me abhor her characters. Mena Suvari, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley were all haunting supporting actors.There is just too much to say about this movie. I beseech everyone to watch this film and see what all the talk is about. &quot;You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry, you will someday.&quot;	5.0	Profound	2001-04-16	15	12	3

But a sad truth that we all seem to miss is that the United States is a huge country with people from many different races and cultures all mixed and blended together. Add to this mix a society and culture that thrives on materialism and self-centeredness and you have what American Beauty attempts to communicate and raise our awareness about.Needless to say, this movie does not portray an ""American"" issue, it effectively raises our awareness that IT IS a world issue because of the fact that most nations around the world make up what we like to call our ""American Society and Culture.""  I DO agree with Mrs. Walker when she stated, ""...it's a sad day when a movie likes this says something this important about who we are as a culture. A sad day indeed...""  People like to say that this movie displays an ""American"" issue and it thrashes its culture, but it is a sad world out there where all nations and cultures have been ""sedated"" with its own desires for personal gain and power.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2QGP7E8LSC7TG	Mark Baum	"Now I can forgive the packaging of the film that features the dancing plastic grocery bag (blown by a couple offscreen crew with leaf blowers). Or the cheesy ""look closer"" slogan. The DVD packaging and extras doesn't dilute the overall strength of the film: A masterpiece by Sam Mendes and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall with the sharp writing of Alan Ball with a tour de force acting ensemble.To this day, when I'm exposed to it, the local Pittsburgh ""soft rock"" station's brainless and vapid morning show hosts can't help but state their disdain for this film. Quite possibly because the film does strike a nerve by those who try in vain to seek ""normalcy"" but fail. It's as if the harder they try the worst traits immediately come to the surface.Have you ever listened to such people? I mean, actually think about what they're saying? Behind the cheery suburbanite gloss lies rot. Most of the time such people just repeat clich&eacute;s or parrot words without giving thought as to what they mean. It's as if it's the modern age's version of neanderthal grunting.Nearly 12-years later and ""American Beauty"" still strikes a jarring chord against such vapidly stupid people. And, thinking back, 1999 was a decent year for films such as ""Fight Club"", ""Magnolia"", ""The Matrix"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"". The great films of that year (barring ""The Iron Giant"" which was a joyous film in and of itself) were decidedly downbeat with the close of 19xx into the opening of 20xx.Think of a David Lynch film and how it plays with the idea of the rot within suburbia. Now move that into the lament of the yuppie class attempting to deal with how keeping busy with appearances eventually becomes. It begins slick but despite the very high production values the rot is right there. It's the end of a dream as the reality hits home: A tale of wasted time with a downbeat ending.The only respite from the darkness would be the black humor and, as it all disintegrates in the end, a cover of ""Because"" plays over the end credits.It's not a movie I watch all the time. But there are moments when it's worth viewing. such as right now. And while it is a very glossy production can lead to the film seeming a bit pretentious it's still a movie I consider a classic after all these years.Maybe ""look closer"" isn't just a trite clich&eacute; after all. The movie is great for those who possess a certain misanthropic, cynical yet realistic streak, such as myself. And goodness knows how many people I've seen die or come close to death. Or even people just shuffling around already dead in regards to their own human spirit. This movie doesn't give answers but it does lead to interesting questions as you do ""look closer"" at what's around you in real life."	5.0	"It's a movie that ""normal"" people hate."	2011-03-26	6	5	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A32NHX2YEHPBU6	Mark Bennett	It is simply astonishing that so many people think &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a masterpiece.  Why? Because every thing about the film is false, contrived, improbable, or ridiculous.  One is tempted to leave one's critique at that and move on, but given the enormous number of people who have evidently been sent into raptures by this film, a dissenter is perhaps obligated to justify his position with illustrative examples of the film's many shortcomings.  Here are a few that come immediately to mind:(1) Ricky's sadistic, homophobic father is - of course - an officer in the Marine Corps, is - of course - really homosexual himself, and is  - of course - a crypto-Nazi. Good God! One can only imagine the agonies that Messrs. Ball and Mendes endured while conceiving that character; but I would guess that it took them many seconds -  perhaps even a full minute -  to dream up &quot;Colonel Fitts, United States Marine Corps.&quot;  This grotesque concoction of cliches reveals more than a simple failure of imagination; it also reveals that the filmmakers know very little about the kind of people they're trying to make a movie about.  And it shows.  None of the characters are remotely believable as human beings, or even as representative &quot;types&quot;; rather, every character in the film is an implausible mixture of the gruesome qualities the filmmakers mistakenly believe that kind of  person should -  indeed, must -  possess, and verisimilitude can go hang.  The result is a movie filled with characters so misconceived they aren't even caricatures; they're simply wrong.(2)  Lester's solution to his predictable mid-life crisis is to extort additional severance pay from his employer by using the threat of a bogus same-sex harassment claim (as an aside to any viewer who might be inspired to try something similar - don't), begin buying dope from the kid next door, go to work in a fast-food burger joint, buy a replica of  the muscle car he wanted to drive when he was in high school, spend his ample free time working out in his garage, and become sexually obsessed with his daughter's 17 year-old friend. Apparently, many people think all this nonsense is daring and innovative; Well, I hate to be the one to break the news, but it isn't.  It is simply one unlikely plot contrivance piled on another in a failed attempt to breathe some life into a theme that has been absolutely done to death: a middle-age man's existential crisis provoked by his realization that he has squandered his youth in a meaningless job and a loveless marriage.  This film's approach to this overworked theme, to have the angst-ridden forty-something hero actually try to turn back the clock and start over in his carefree, horny and stoned adolescence, is every bit as ridiculous as Kevin Spacey looks in his burger stand get-up.(3)  To compensate for the lack of a coherent plot Messrs. Ball and Mendes resort to every tired device in the book to get from one scene to the next, including the ghastly music-video gimmick of hand-held video shots, liberal use of &quot;artistic&quot; dream sequences, and -  God help us  - &quot;The Uncurtained Window.&quot;  This last device is particularly revealing, because, as a general rule, one knows that the makers of a film have run out of ideas when they try to move things along by having one character peer through a  wide-open window and fortuitously observe other characters engaged in activity crucial to the story (Hitchcock and a few other geniuses notwithstanding).  And the climatic bit in which Ricky's father (the sadistic, Nazi-loving, gay-bashing gay Marine, remember?) observes Ricky and Lester apparently having it off is so ridiculous one can't even bother to condemn it.(4) Perhaps recognizing what a mess they had on their hands, the filmmakers attempt to salvage matters by tossing in a lump of half-hearted mysticism, the message of which is that the beauty of life is all around us (hence the title of the film - get it?), but the hopeless idiots who are condemned to live in suburbia don't notice this because they are too caught up in their petty concerns.  I suppose that kind of sanctimonious, greeting card sentiment (&quot;you'd better stop and smell the roses, Buster!&quot;, or, more accurately, &quot;you'd better stop and watch the plastic bag blow in the breeze, Sport!&quot;) is considered profound stuff in &quot;The Industry&quot;, but by any real-world standard it's condescending, simple-minded drivel.One could go on, but why bother?  &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a perfect example of the Hollywood hype machine successfully manipulating the public into acclaiming its product.  The formula is simple and well-established: if a film is said to be &quot;profound&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;important&quot; often enough and loud enough, then the movie-going herd, er, public, will conclude that, yes, the film is profound, and beautiful, and important.  However, in this particular case the emperor is quite, quite naked.  Did I write that it's astonishing that so many people think this film is a masterpiece?  I need to correct that: It's frightening.	1.0	False, Contrived, Improbable, Ridiculous	2001-07-13	109	59	50

If you are a person of morals and think Hollywood is morally bankrupt and celebrate their immorality then this movie is proof of that belief.  It is a microcosm of liberalism where all the &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;good&quot; characters are disfunctional (drug users, adulterers, liars, blackmailers, voyeurs, etc).  This movie won Best Picture for one reason -- payback for Forrest Gump which was widely hated by the Hollywood elite for it's virtues.

This movie is rated R because it has an intense sex scene, and sexual, drug, and profanity content. This movie won five academy awards in 1999. It stars Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Allison Jenney, Peter Gallagher, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley, and Chris Cooper. Everyone can relate to at least one of the characters and to the desire of temptation in the movie.In the movie, they take an ordinary suburban middle class family and analyze it. The movie has an average family, the mother Carolyn, father Lester, and a daughter named Jane. Lester is a middle age man who is raging against the dying light. Carolyn is frigid and furious, but is incredibly vulnerable and lost. Jane is impassive, unreadable, and mad at the world.During the movie, Lester is going through a mid-life crisis. His wife deprives him of emotional, physical, and ""sexual"" love. His daughter and he are growing apart, which makes him very weary. He starts to look at his life and realizes he was not happy anymore. At this point, he starts to realize he has the power to turn everything around-and he does.For an example, during the movie he quits his job and blackmails his boss for a whole year's salary. He then buys the car of his dreams. After that he decides, he wants to work for a burger joint because it reminds him of his good old days. While trying to regain his formative years he starts smoking pot and working out.The artistic symbolism grabs onto any artistic views and pulls you in. It shows how people imprison themselves in cages while hoping for escape. It is a black comedy including mystery and twists. One artistic symbolism, materializes as each character has their moments of solitariness. The rose petals gave it a beautiful yet lull way of expressing the desire of temptation."	5.0	Beautiful Master-piece	2004-12-09	11	8	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A319KYEIAZ3SON	Mary Whipple	"Winner of Academy Awards in 2000 for Best Picture, Best Actor (Kevin Spacey), Best Cinematography (Conrad L. Hall) , Best Screenplay (Alan Ball), and Best Director (Sam Mendes), this genre-defying film appears, on the surface, to be a typical domestic drama, filled with black humor and containing a coming-of-age subplot--and then it becomes surreal.  Lester Burnham (Spacey), like all the other characters in the film, is unhappy and alienated.  He hates his job, dislikes his bosses, and resents his hostile and driven wife, but when he finally frees himself from his desk job and takes a job at a fast food establishment, everything in his life goes crazy.Lester is not-so-secretly attracted to the bored, teenage friend (the flirty Mena Suvari) of his daughter (beautifully played by Thora Birch).  His wife (Annette Bening) has shut herself off from him, and initiates a tawdry affair.  His alienated daughter is attracted to the equally alienated, drug-selling teenager (Wes Bentley) next door, a boy who has just been released from a two-year hospitalization and who stands outside her house shooting videos.  The boy's father (Chris Cooper), an ex-Marine, rules the family with an ungloved fist.The Burnhams and the Fittses, next door, appear at first to be fairly typical suburban families, living typical suburban lives, but as these alienated people try, first, to cope with their alienation and then figure out a way to resolve it, the film becomes darkly surreal.  Each character chooses to cope in an extreme way, a way that would not make sense for  the ""typical"" families which they appear to represent, and eventually the characters, acting on their extreme choices, collide in a dramatic, horrifying conclusion.Director Mendes somehow manages to make this genre-bending film work, creating a likable character in Lester (Spacey), a termagant wife (Bening) who manages to elicit a modicum of sympathy, and teenagers who exhibit the typical angst of their age while, at the same time, evoking our own tender memories.  Even the domineering Col. Fitts becomes human as we see him trying to cope with his own threatening demons.  The drama builds slowly, the tension rises inexorably, and the final scenes are intense.  Astonishingly, even the final scene has elements of black humor.  With all its Academy Awards, and its additional Academy nominations for Best Actress, Best Music, and Best Editing, this is a top-notch film which will interest film buffs and lovers of dark comedy, and its ""heart"" makes it unforgettable.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3PA0W1VUDU4J7	Mat	"(...)The first time I saw American Beauty it was the last in three consecutive weekend movie run. The other two films were Fight Club and Bringing Out the Dead. All three films are about men trying to come to terms to what it means to be a man in America in this day and age. Fight Club finds meaning in deconstructing everything down to base needs, feeling through pain. Bringing Out the Dead gives meaning to its character through drug use, but is was in American Beauty that I found some sense of hope.In the film, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) plays a middle aged, middle class suburbanite, with seemingly everything he could desire. He has a good, well paying job; a beautiful wife (Annette Bening); a large luxurious house; and a lovely daughter (Thora Birch). Yet, with all of this he is not happy. In fact, all of these things are not quite what they seem. His employer is facing cut backs, and he may soon lose his job. He marriage is in shambles, and his daughter openly hates him. Early, we see him masturbating in the shower, in narration; he states this is the highpoint of his day. All is not well in the house of Burnham.All of this changes when Lester meets Angela (Mena Suvari), his daughter, Jane's gorgeous, cheerleader friend. On first seeing Angela during a cheer routine, Lester feel a special, lustful connection. Later that night, Lester overhears Angela playfully tell Jane that if he would only work out, he would be sexy. His lust over this teenage vixen becomes the catalyst for the film and Lester's very life.Soon after Lester quits his job, in fact he bilks the company for a year's salary by threatening to disclose scandalous information that he has become privy to. He begins smoking pot, buys a hot rod.. He plays with remote control cars, takes a job at a fast food joint, and of course does start working out. In every way he reverts back to his teenage years. Even the soundtrack begins blaring out classic rock tunes from the 1970's. Finally after years, decades even, of feeling low, miserable, not alive, he feels great.This reversion back to his glory days is only the beginning. It is a reversion back to the days when he had fun, when he felt alive. But he is not a man who will stop there. This is just a beginning point to a life long conversion of living a full life, as opposed to a life full of the right things, but that is ultimately empty. Or it would be if he was not shortly dead (this is not nearly the spoiler you might think it is, for Lester announced his death within the first minutes of the film.) Towards the end of the film we can see that Lester is already outgrowing his childish behavior. When he yells at his daughter, he immediately feels the sting of regret. When given the chance to indulge in his lusts, he backs away, understanding that it is not right. Just as the music changed to classic rock with the first change, here it has changed again, turning into the same classic rock being covered by newer, contemporary artists.Many will probably say that using the lust for a teen, and illicit drug us as a catalyst for change, is not a change for the better. I can already hear my mother scolding me for having seen the movie, much less reviewed it from 2,000 miles away in Oklahoma. Yet, here it works, and works well. I don't believe the film is saying that these things should be the means to a change, these things only served as means for this character to break free from the rut that had become his life. There is a telling scene where Lester and his wife are overcome with sexual desire. As he dips his wife to kiss her, she stops the embrace because he is near to spilling his glass of wine on an expensive couch. An argument ensues with Lester proclaiming that ""it's just a couch,"" while his wife is horrified at the thought of ruining said couch. There lies one of the central themes of the film. That these characters are so wrapped up in the material that they lose sight of the better pleasure of life, including love making.It is not a perfect film. The Burnham's neighbor, Col. Fritts (Chris Cooper) seems a caricatured archetype. His plays a hateful, homophobe who really carries deep rooted homosexual tendencies is too outlandish to be considered real. Though it must be said the part is played marvelously by Chris Cooper. Jane's speech about being a freak too, may move the young kids who consider themselves the nonconformist, shy-type, but it is too after-school special for my tastes.I've left out some of the best scenes and an important character, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). He plays the drug dealing son of Col. Fritts, who likes to record everything on his video camera. There is a moving scene in which he and Jane watch an old tape of his of a plastic bag floating through the air. It is a moving, poetic scene that conjures up thought of the futility of life and its very beauty. It is that type of movie. It creates beautiful, moving, simple scenes that bring a sense of hope to life, while at the same time, showing the ultimate horror of living it.(...)"	3.0	Pretty Silly, But Fun	2005-05-03	5	2	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2TVAIBZ31J9H1	"""mattf18"""	"""American Beauty"" is one of the more celebrated films of recent years. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and is praised for its ""complex"" look at American suburban monotony. However, in its supposed subversion of cultural norms, it plays into them fairly strongly. The most notable of these deal with the female characters.The film's protagonist is Lester Burnham, famously played by Kevin Spacey in the role that made him one of the most popular leading men in hollywood. However, the writing of this character engulfs the female characters in the film and subjugates them. Lester's wife, Carolyn, is the most one-dimensional character in the film. She is materialistic, selfish, and false. We know each of these things as soon as the film begins, and learn little more about her as the film progresses. Of course, her only possible source of salvation is Lester, who in one scene tries to snap her out of her obsession with material goods. Angela is another character who is blatantly framed as the typical concept of ""American Beauty"", as a young, blonde, sexually forward female who wants to be a model. However, when she undergoes her transformation at the end of the film, she is still at the mercy of Lester, and is reliant on him for comfort and safety. Janie, Lester's daughter, who is supposed to be the free spirit of the group, is ""set free"" by Ricky, the boy next door who invites her to run away with him, and ""teaches her about the world"".In one particularly misogynistic scene, Lester, Carolyn, and Janie are eating dinner in their dining room, until Lester lashes out at both of them, throws dishes against the wall, and forces Janie to sit down. Lester is portrayed as the protagonist in this scene, rebelling against these ""tyranical"" women who are holding him back.I see the treatment of the female characters in ""American Beauty"" to be its biggest flaw."	2.0	Heavily Praised, But Many Overlooked Flaws	2004-05-11	8	5	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2YEC0AQCTR97J	Matt Golden	It always amazes me at how much hatred can be inspired by an intelligent, thought-provoking movie.  Scroll down and read some of the negative  reviews; the people who wrote them truely have no idea what they're talking  about.  I agree completely with the well-written, calm review that quoted  Kevin Spacey as saying that American Beauty is a film about context.  This  movie apparently is a love-it or hate-it film (as, I've found, most  intelligent cinema is).  Great literature is filled mostly with (no,  comprised completely of) stories that provoke us.  Maybe we agree with  them, maybe we hate them, but the cause for hate is more often than not  misunderstanding, or, as the old saying goes, &quot;they've gotten their  toes stepped on.&quot;  Art forces our noses down to the filth of our  actions; many are frightened by a film like American Beauty, which portrays  these events, but does not condone them.  People grow afraid when a  brilliant piece of work such as American Beauty makes them realize  understand why people act this way, for, with understanding, comes  comprehension; there is a line between the two.  Once fully comprehended,  it makes no sense for these people to hate the actions of the characters  onscreen; but they _want_ to hate them, to show how truly different and  superior they themselves are.  What it boils down to is that we are all  human, and all capable of this behavior, only some do not like to admit it.  American Beauty, for all its beauty, shows us a darker side of suburbia,  and ourselves.  What the movie's detractors fail to realize is that once we  are shown, we stand a much better chance of curtailing such behavior.	5.0	a true Beauty	2000-08-29	3	2	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AR6361134V2KO	Matthew Heltemes	I have seen quite a few movies in my time, and I can say this is one of the best.  If not the best.  I love it's satirical look on suburban life (being from the suburbs, it was especially funny), to it's stunning  cinematography, to it's splendid performances (esp. Mr. Spacey).  While  people definitely have their own tastes, you cannot argue with the simply  magnificent scene of the plastic bag floating and it's poignant dialogue.  If you aren't into &quot;artsy&quot; movies, or if you're against  &quot;mainstream&quot; movies, this will satisfy everyone's tastes!

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	The first time I saw the now famous poster for American Beauty was months before it opened. I was going down the escalator of a posh local multiplex, and there it was at the end of my descent. I looked at those red roses adorning an actresses midsection, and I remarked to a friend that this looked like a very special movie. I don't what it was about the artwork that made me say that, but it turned out to be an accurate remark. The movie opened in a limited engagement in September 1999 and went on to build and build. In March, it won Oscars in major categories - Best Picture, Best Actor [Kevin Spacey] and Best Director. At the time, there were some nay-sayers who said the film painted too dark a picture of American life. I won't debate this, but I will say that there are precedents in the Academy Awards. For example, Billy Wilder's The Apartment, a scathing comedy about how morally low some people will go to move up in corporate life, won Best Picture in 1961. Brilliant is brilliant, no matter what the subject is, and America has had a seriously cynical side to it for decades.Welcome to the Burnham household. Meet Lester and Carolyn [Spacey and Annette Bening] and their lovely teenage daughter, Jane [Thora Birch]. The Burnhams have it all - the lucrative jobs, the topflight public schools, the perfect suburban home, the immaculate lawn with its borders of American beauty roses. What could possibly be missing from their lives? Oh, just little things like happiness and fulfillment. Lester and Carolyn certainly no longer love each other. Theirs is an uneasy truce. On the surface, Jane comes across as a snide and ungrateful child, but you have to ask yourself who wouldn't be eager to leave such a dismal scene? How often many of us point the finger at our children when what we are showing them are lives devoid of love, passion, honestly and integrity.Jane is a cheerleader at the local high school, and one night the Burnhams decide to attend a game. They want to show support for their daughter, who truly doesn't want them there. Lester sees another cheerleader, a friend of Jane's, and instantly falls in lust. He becomes obsessed with the girl. He quits his job and blackmails his boss into giving him $60,000 severance pay. He buys a red Pontiac Firebird. Carolyn, who constantly berates herself for not being a success, retaliates by starting an affair with an arch rival in the real estate business. Their actions are not exactly what they appear to be. Lester's pursuit isn't all about an older man / young girl relationships. Its about the loss of youth and passion and about the dire consequences that can be spawned by living a whole lifetime of fitting in. Carolyn feels she has totally lost controlnot just of Lester and Jane, but of life as a whole. I think they are after the same answers, only Lester uses a brutally honest approach. And now Jane is really ready to split.Compounding all these problems is the arrival of some strange new neighbors. Col. Frank Fitts is a retired Marine who's feelings are so repressed he's become a walking time bomb. His wife has retreated into a haunting, silent world of her own. Teenage son Ricky is obsessed with videotaping everything he encounters, including Jane. He supports his hobby by dealing vast quantities of dope. Soon Jane and Ricky have a thing going, and everything climaxes for all involved in one bizarre night of the most memorable and improabable miscommunications.Is this a comedy or a drama? That's hard to say. Many viewers do not relate to the Burnhams specific problems, but they do identify with their general feelings. In laughing at them, many of us are laughing at ourselves. Take the problem of trying too hard to fit in. There is nothing wrong with doing this, unless you lose your own identity in the process. And many would agree that, while there is nothing fundamentally wrong with being American, there is currently something fundamentally wrong with American life. Personally, I think it has less to do with moral issues than it does with a basic spiritual emptiness that comes with being obsessed with external appearances and with material goods.American Beauty is a brilliant movie and, to me, probably was the best American film of 1999. Like a few others before it, it stands uniquely on its own, owing very little to movies that came before it. I love the way it peels away the layers of the Burnhams' lives like onions. I admire its essentially nonjudgmental point of view. Best of all, I like the way that everyone is somehow redeemed at the end. Its a movie that makes you wish there were a few more great ones like it out there.	5.0	On My Top Ten List for 1999	2002-03-19	5	4	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3QE8SFOXRVI0D	Matthew McGrath	"In my opinion, American Beauty is one of the greatest films ever made.  It's got everything...great acting, a terrific plot (some say it's contrived, but I say that's ridiculous), fantastic cinematography, and fabulous symbolisms throughout.  Kevin Spacey turns in his best performance yet (in my opinion) as Lester, the ""middle aged, can't stand my boring corporate job, there's got to be more to life than this, my wife is a money-grubbing freak"" man that will try anything to break free from his monotonous lifestyle.  The movie functions around the phrase ""Look Closer.""  In fact a sign with that phrase is posted on Lester's cubicle wall at work.  The premise behind this phrase is that from the outside, everyone appears to be normal, but it's not until you see life from a much closer point of view when you find that everyone has their own quirks and idiosyncratic shortcomings that make life out to be very challenging.There are so many memorable quotes from this film.  These quotes will stick in your head for days and you will crave a second and even third viewing of this movie.  Sam Mendes' big screen directing debut is nothing short of phenomenal and judging by ""Road to Perdition"", his future work will no doubt be great."	5.0	Look Closer	2003-12-30	8	7	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A58PILGILXCRN	Matthew Torres	American Beauty is the kind of rare film that comes along that could actually change your life.  It leaves you wanting to run out and tell everyone everything you've always wanted to tell, but were too embarassed; to do everything you've always wanted to do, but were to afraid to take the risk.  Whenever I watch this movie I always cry at two parts - when they are watching the video of the bag blowing in the wind and he talks about how there is so much beauty in the world - and at the end when Lester talks about falling stars and his grandmother's papery hands - and that shot of Carolyn on the amusement park ride and the way he says &quot;and Carolyn&quot; -  such subtle things, but they really punch straight to the heart.  This film is proof that what really makes a film great is not special effects or big budgets, or even big name stars (even though there are stars here), but a story and characters that make you FEEL something so profound that it stays with you for the rest of your life.  American Beauty is one of those greats.  Let it flow through you... like rain.	5.0	it flows through me like rain	2000-12-06	13	10	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3TNAC1EWMG39T	"Matthew Weaver ""cesarfaison"""	Which isn't an easy thing to say, since the Oscar-nominated actor is surrounded by a dream cast: powerhouses like Peter Gallagher, Chris Cooper, Alison Janney, Scott Bakula and of course Annette Bening; and rising stars  like Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. All actors are at the top of  their games in AB; however, the movie is Spacey's vehicle. His Lester  Burnham is a sight to behold as he morphs from a weaselly middle-aged klutz  into a multidimensional, full-faceted masterpiece. Forget anything else  you've seen him in; this is Spacey's best work to date. The actor shines,  especially when Lester, seeking &quot;as little responsibility as  possible,&quot; applies for work at a fast food joint, and buys the car of  his dreams. &quot;I rule,&quot; he declares, fist raised upward in  celebration. He certainly does. Kudoes also go to director Sam Mendes for  his first production: Next movie please, Sam.	5.0	Kevin Spacey owns this movie.	2000-02-26	1	0	1

It is a very realview into the all too real and extreme banal realities of life.  Weforget of these sometimes, but only because of the beauty we see. American Beauty portrays this on screen perfectly.  The director, Sam Mendes, does an excellent job of as well.  There could not have been a more real cast for the film also.  Kevin Spacey was at his best.  He certainly deserved his Academy Award.  Anette Benning portrays Carolyn to a tee.  Wes Bently was believable.  He made us see beauty in our own lives, no matter how cynical they may seem.  Other cast members deserve congrats also.  Mena Suvari, Thora Birch, Peter Gallagher, Chris Cooper.  And how could it all have been done without the touch of Alan Ball's genius.  The composed music was in sync with the film perfectly, thanks to Thomas Newman.  Extrodinary, and incredible.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	APOUYO1BEPK22	"M. B Cole ""Kegrun"""	Lester (Kevin Spacey) is middle aged and living what on the outside looks like a perfect life. Big house in a nice neighborhood, 2 cars, pretty wife and daughter, and a good job. But on the inside, he's miserable. His job sucks and he has to answer to a younger boss that hasn't even been there a few months. His wife is cold `b' and doesn't even want to have sex with him. His daughter hates him for reasons unknown. And he just really doesn't even like himself that much either. Then one day, he goes to a basketball game with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) to watch his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) do her performance in her cheerleading squad. That day changes his life on the spot. He sees Angela (Mena Suvari), Jane's friend, out on the court also, and he realizes his life is in a rut and he wants to be free from it. He quits his job and starts to work out again (mainly to get Angela's attention). He sells his car to get the car of his dreams. And he starts to smoke pot.Luckily his new next door neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) is a pot dealer. Not only a pot dealer but a weird documentarian that goes to school with Jane. Ricky's dad is a tough father who is also a homophobic Colonel in the marine corp. He loves his son, but sure doesn't know how to show it correctly. Though Ricky and Jane start to like each other, the interactions between Ricky and Lester leave the dad to wondering what is really going on between the two.Carolyn, though a coldhearted `B', used to not be what she is today. She was once a fun loving free spirited girl, but Lester has no clue where that girl went. She's so wrapped up in her real estate business she doesn't even think of Lester anymore. Her arch nemesis in the biz is Buddy Kane, and even though she tries her best to beat the man, nothing works and it makes her incredibly stressed out.  As Lester is trying to work out his mid-life crisis, his wife Carolyn is working out her stress in a much different way.American Beauty is such a great movie. The way it looks into the soul of the normal suburbanite family is really funny and great. Nothing is perfect no matter how it looks. Somedays I really feel like Lester even though I'm not married or have kids. Where I'm just stuck doing the same thing every day and then `BAM', I go a little crazy and break out of that shell. I've even quit my job before because of this. Thank God to, because now I'm much happier. Though you can't help but feel bad for Lester. At least I do. He did so much to support his family, to have them only hate him in the end. Sure he's not always there for his daughter, but that's no reason to be hated. She actually joked about killing him. Seriously... what the heck. Her life could be a million times worse. And his wife, ugh, I'm not even going to go into it. How a woman could do what she does to him is ridiculous. And even though Ricky Fitts is friggin crazy, he's still a cool character. I don't buy into that whole `deep' and `emo' stuff he says about floating bags and dead people/animals, but how he's so blunt about things makes me really like that character.In the end, I would definitely watch this movie. Such a great story, and such a sad ending.P.S. - I really hope Angela was 18.	5.0	Perfect ain't so perfect.	2009-03-17	13	11	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A35XMSURGM0L1N	M. Buisman	'American Beauty' might be the best movie coming out of the United States in the last ten years. Everything falls together in this great movie. The story is great; a man in his midlife crisis who quits his job, doesn't understand his daughter and reverts to puberistic behavior, but he loves it.His wife is brilliantly played by Annette Benning. Especially foreigners who are living or lived in the United States will see the humor in her performance. She is so American that most American's will not see her little over-the-top acting which makes it great. And then of course Kevin Spacey who is great as Lester Burnham.There are so many themes, so many characters. As he says in the end of the movie; they look normal from the outside but in fact they are not. And that's what this movie is about.It might be a little strange to watch sometimes, or it can even make you ashamed of yourself but 'American Beauty' is one of the best movies in the subjects of midlife crisis, gayness, American society etc.	5.0	Best movie in years	2004-06-15	5	2	3

I know that many will say that the symbolism and lighting among other production qualities were magnificent, but when you get right down to what the characters are doing--the plot, I was pretty disgusted.  The dream scenes and the reality scene were basic child molestation.  I believe this movie was nothing more than art for art's sake.  I liked the music, but found the story to be very cold and distant, definitely not a touchy-feely-feel-good kind of movie.

It is an intimate portrait of two families who live next door to each other, seen sometimes through the eyes of their two teenage children, and sometimes through the eyes of the narrator, Les, who is experiencing his second teenage-hood after he quits his job to go work at a fastfood restraunt.  But inside all this, &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a dark look into the American culture today, how we treat other people, how we treat ourselves, and how all of these things can come back to haunt us in ways that we can only have imagined.And if you love this movie as much as I do, you must watch &quot;fight Club&quot;, &quot;Dogma&quot;, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; and &quot;The Talented Mr. Riply&quot;.  I am still not exactly sure how so many amazing movies all managed to come out in the scope of under a year, but they did all the same...and I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite.

This epiphany is the beginning of his midlife crisis.  He realizes that his wife cares more about her job and material things than about him.  In fact, he can't remember the last time they made love.  He hates his job.  And he doesn't know anything about his teenage daughter.  Worse - he finds himself attracted to his daughter's best friend.  He is determined to make some changes.  But is it too late?Although Lester's story is the main theme of the movie, I found the lives of the other characters to be even more intriguing.  The wannabe-nympho Angela, the neurotic wife Carolyn, the rebellious, confused teen Jane, the supressed, dangerous, and strange Ricky and his overbearing father.  They are all great substories with hidden surprises.Excellent acting by Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, Thora Birch, and the rest of the cast.It's definitely not a feel good movie as it continues in its depressing vain all the way through to the end.

I was a little leery about seeing this movie. I was afraid I had been  overexposed to action movies and special effects.  I was worried that a  movie without asteroids or dinosaurs wouldn't keep my attention. Worst of  all I was afraid it was a chick flick. I was so impressed with the quality  of this movie I don't know where to begin. To me the movie was a journey  for Lester, he was unhappy with his life and didn't know how he had come to  be so. The ending was known right from the start, but you hoped it still  wouldn't come because you liked Lester, and by the end you wanted him to be  happy. Unfortunately, for him the first moment in his life he knew who he  was and seemed truley happy was his last. The look on his face during the  last scene is what made him a lock for the oscar as far as I am concerned.  It reminded me of Jack Nicholson in &quot;One flew over the cuckoo's  nest&quot; American Beauty is a great  movie. If you didn't think so thats  okay.

This is probably the most  over-rated, boring waste of time &amp; money I've ever seen.  I thought the  acting was superb - by everyone.  BUT!  The actual storyline was terrible  and the scripting was bordering on pathetic.  I'm trying to decide the  worst part of the movie... was it being bored to tears?  was it the  predictable and unoriginal storyline?  was it the unclimactic ending? was  it the feeling of annoyance at my waste of money?  I mean, I can count the  number of times I laughed (and this was supposed to be at least somewhat  comical) on 1 hand...This film had no business being nominated for  anything outside of the Rasberry Awards.  If you're looking for a  wonderfully told story w/ exceptional acting, watch The Green Mile (it's  long, though, I'm warning you now).  If you're looking for a dysfunctional  family just turn your TV to the Simpsons - at least you'll get a half-hour  of laughs... and you won't waste any money doing it!	1.0	Unfortunately, there's no option for 0 (zero) Stars...	2000-09-01	65	18	47
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2ZLROGIL2V7GV	Michael Crane	&quot;American Beauty&quot; is a pure cinematic triumph that is both funny and sad.  It's disturbing... and yet, it's extremely provocative and deep.  The film is an extraordinary achievement that reveals a tragic and realistic story about a family that is anything but ordinary.  It's a film with so many layers that it is almost impossible to dissect them all in one single thought.Meet Lester Burnham; a man who feels like he's completely dead inside.  His wife and daughter despise him and do not show him any signs of respect.  On the surface, the family seems like a picture-perfect family that everybody dreams about--but inside is a completely different matter.  His wife is obsessed with material possessions and doesn't care for &quot;petty&quot; things like love or life, while his daughter resents herself because she isn't &quot;perfect.&quot;  Lester's mental coma is rudely interrupted when he meets his daughter's friend and starts fantasizing about her.  The awakening might be due to a disturbing thought or feeling, but the wake-up call changes Lester and allows him to realize that there's always time to erase his &quot;forced-image&quot; and be the person he really is.  This is all a set-up for a funny, disturbing and tragic movie.I don't know about everybody else, but my mind was literally racing around when this movie was playing before my eyes.  It's one of those films that allows you to pick up on something different upon each viewing.  As I said in the beginning of the review, this film has a number of layers to it.  There's so many different meanings and points to the film that it is nearly impossible to describe them all in one little review.  Besides, the fun part of the movie is discovering these meanings and points for yourself.  You know a film is successful when you totally lose yourself to it and allow it to challenge you in every way.  The film is crafted flawlessly and doesn't have a wasted minute in it.The acting from Kevin Spacey is really a sight to see.  He gives his character all of the right needs and feelings that is necessary for the authenticity of his role.  You don't even look at him as an actor--but as the real person he portrays.  It is certainly a milestone in his acting career that will continue to be remembered throughout all cinematic history.  Annette Bening is also superb in her role and brings life to her character, as well.  Everybody in the film should be applauded, as they all make the film what it is.The DVD has some neat features to offer.  The picture quality is fantastic and the sound is more than great.  You have the option of watching the movie in DTS if your system is able to play it.  Extras included are commentary from the director and writer, a behind-the-scenes featurette, cast and crew biographies, trailers and more.  While I wouldn't had mind a Two-Disc edition of the movie, this is a pretty impressive package overall.&quot;American Beauty&quot; is a breath-taking masterpiece with a very high replay value.  It's a terrific film on every front and does not disappoint for a single second.  While it's not a movie that everybody will like, it's most certainly one to check out if you are a lover of films.  If you're looking for something that isn't so ordinary, then this may be the chance that you are seeking.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AAB123I989T1I	Michael Crowley	&quot;American Beauty&quot; is being interpreted as a film about appearances but I believe it is more than that.  Suburbia has been satirized for decades but this film has captured America's attention more  than those other films.  The people who have found it shallow have offered  shallow interpretations--&quot;the perfect family from the outside is  dysfunctional when subjected to scrutiny.&quot;  Also, reviewers proffer  that the film is a morality lesson telling us that pursuit of material  possessions is empty and cannot provide happiness.  Yes, yes, but these are  truisms and there has to be more to &quot;American Beauty&quot; than  this.I think &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a filmic version of U2's  album &quot;Achtung Baby.&quot;  To me it says this:  People who are  obsessed with the way things look rather than what they are fail to  perceive truth and beauty.  The boy next door epitomizes the search for  reality, and the film is about Lester's evolution in that direction.  The  less effort he expends in creating an illusion, the more acute his  discernment of reality--and with that growing discernment comes the  revelation that reality is far more emotional than the illusions we  construct to represent reality.  Thus, the object of his desires, when  viewed through Lester's evolved eyes, ceases to be a symbol of seduction  and becomes what she is, a frightened child.&quot;American Beauty&quot;  is a wonderful film.  Best of the year?  I don't know.  I preferred  &quot;Eyes Wide Shut,&quot; which deals with the exact same themes.	4.0	Interpretations Galore	2000-04-02	8	6	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3EE8QR877HEIM	michael d. chlanda	This first time effort from Director Sam Mendes illustrates a family on the verge of implosion.  Kevin Spacey leads an excellent cast, including, Annette Benning, as his shrewish ***** of a wife, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari, are also good, as well as Chris Cooper, who's ex-military father character, and who is more than a bit obsessed with his son's life, is a scary fellow.  Kevin Spacey rules, as a man who wants to be happy, and through his attempts at happiness, reverting to an earlier time in his life, to impress the young hottie (played by Suvari) become a tragic, comic, figure.  Benning also seeks happiness, in the arms of a fellow real estate broker, but ultimately feels unfulfilled. The rest of the cast, including a low-key, plain, mousy, performance by a pre-West Wing Allison Janney, are excellent.  It's a very twisted story, but a good one (with a decent soundtrack).  The special edition features a second tape with behind the scenes interviews and other features.  It might be too technical for those not interested in all the details, but might make an interesting study for film students, seeing the genius of a first time (film) director.  Worth its five awards.	5.0	Twisted, funny, poignant, excellent; Spacey rules!	2003-07-14	2	1	1

Every character with the exception of the two gay men is flawed deeply on some level : Lester (Kevin Spacey)is so bored and lifeless in his marriage with the overcompetitive, driven real estate agent wife that he actively seeks out an affair with his daughter's teenage friend Angela. Angela for her part is attention starved and seeks to realize her needs through sexual actions. His daughter strikes up a relationship with a voyeristic cameraman who is selling drugs behind the back of his Marine father, who disdains gay people, but reveals towards the end of the movie that he himself is gay. The end is perplexing at first because there are several people who may want Lester dead from a sullen wife who is ""refusing to be a victim,"" the gay marine, his daughter's voyaristic boyfriend acting on the wishes of his girlfriend (Lester's daughter.)

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1RPTVW5VEOSI	Michael J. Edelman	"""American Beauty"" is certainly one of the most beautifully filmed movies of its time, and contains a number of great performances from actors like Chris Cooper and Kevin Spacey. Watching it, it's easy to be drawn in by the visuals and the stunning score. But behind all that lies an empty script that offers no insights, no development, and most of all, no subtlety.From the beginning we're told by the narrator that he's a dead man- so what from that point, we're just waiting to see how exactly he buys it. It's a cheap trick, and one that removes much of the need to develop the plot; we're left with a number of trivial stories that don't tell us anything or advance the plot. When Spacey's death comes, it's like the punchline to a bad joke.There are three narrative threads in this film, none of which gets developed very far: Early on, Spacey's character decides to stop caring about success and becomes infatuated with a teenaged girl. His wife (Anette Benning in her usual stiff attempt at acting) looks elsewhere for money and affection. Their daughter looks for love from the neighborhood dope dealer, who lives with a stereotypically emotionally numb mother and a father who's a caricature of the retired military non-com. And that's really it.The story unfolds in a very stagey and unnatural way, relying on  music and an excess of gimmicky camera shots to make the transition from one scene to the next. There's an unnaturalness about the whole enterprise that really keeps the viewer from becoming emotionally involved with any of the characters. It's not unlike watching an ant farm.So three stars for the score and the peformances by Cooper and Spacey, and none for the story or direction."	3.0	Beautiful, stylish, and empty	2005-12-22	11	7	4

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A22T9088PGB8FI	Michael Miller	Let me free associate a bit about American beauty. I saw many of the characters as being off track--perhaps they had forgotten who they once were.Lester had shriveled to a powerless dweeb under the the tyrannical bitchdom of carolyn. carlolyn had drifted from the spontaneous girl who once flashed traffic helicopters and faked seizures at frat parties. you can see it when Lester asks her what happened to that girl I used to know... and she drifts back to that place if for only a moment and then wigs out about his precarious beer and the 4000 dollar couch. The real estate king and Carolyn are so drunk with success and power that they are mere characictures of who they used to be.I saw jane as finding herself and being willing to make her own  decisions and to choose love regardless of the social implications. She seemed to become repulsed by her friend's values. What's interesting is the central characters seem to &quot;find themselves&quot; in a space of about 90 seconds. lester's transformation was the most satisfying for me. His assertion with carolyn and the endearing midlife crisis (e.g. &quot;I rule&quot;) He of course over does it a bit with the mid-life crisis stuff, but ultimately returns to self.Ricky was harder for me to peg. I am wondering if he wasn't more for the other characters to play off of. He felt very intensly. Ricky was almost injured by the beauty he saw in life, where the other characters were dead and numb to experinece His family was interesting I mean they were essentially dead. And they were such an insular family. you could see it when they all sort of panicked when there is a knock on the door and they all look at each other frightened.	5.0	Deadness	2000-09-22	1	1	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	APRCJ3J03PBL7	Michael Tropp	The characters in this movie are just so multi-faced, creative, and have magnetic personalities. Lester just has an incredible look on life, and a great personality. The actors in this movie were obviously the creme-de-la-creme since they can cause such emotion in person like me. Annette Benning's character makes me have such rejection towards her and her personality. I feel so sorry for Lester in the movie, his wife couldn't care less about him, and she is also cheating on him. His daughter can't stand him and feels he is an idiot. Then he finally realizes that after all of his downhill happenings he actually feels good about himself, and then he dies. The montage after he was shot was the most moving scene for me in the movie. It went from his most fond memories of life, and the things most important to him while all the time showing the emotion and reaction of his friends and family towards his death. This movie deserved every applause or good review. It is by far my favorite movie of all time, for some reason I am always drawn to it when I feel like watching a DVD. The emotions and the dull life of this one man are just so entertaining, and never get tiring. I recommend this to anyone and everyone.	5.0	HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS MOVE?!	2002-08-13	3	0	3

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A28NRPDIYAXG2C	MikeB	&quot;I rule!&quot; is one of the many things that Lester Burnham says  during his nervous breakdown.  He is the main character in this excellent  movie about suburban America. Starring Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey this  movie makes you laugh as you get pulled into its wonderful story.  Kevin  Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a husband and father who decides to pursue  a life in smoking pot, working at a fast food restaurant, and chasing after  a high school girl who happens to be her daughter's best friend.  Meanwhile his wife (Annette Bening), a real estate salesman, is also having  a nervous breakdown.  She cheats on Lester with some other guy who is also  in real estate.  This provides one of the most amusing scenes in the movie  when Bening is making out in a van with that guy and they are driving  through a fast food place; the place where Lester works.  He catches them  red-handed and its just, hilarious.  The Burnham's neighbors also have a  large part in the movie even though they are just basically supporting the  Burnham family's characters.  They are also a three-person family.  The  father is abusive and prejudice, the mother just takes it all and doesn't  say a word, and their son (newcomer Wes Bentley) is Lester's drug-dealer  and also becomes his daughter's girlfriend.  From what I have written I  hope you can decide if you are interested in this movie.  I would not  recommend it to people easily offended.  I would recommend it to people who  like dark comedies.  So give it a shot.  I think you will probably enjoy  it.	5.0	&quot;Beauty&quot;-ful	2000-05-23	0	0	0

Clever biz move.But the movie itself is absolutely OTT.It deals among other topics with magic in ordinary life and the doors that lead to it.Many bands like Mirror or X Japan for example use the same color symbols pattern which stand for passion.KURENAI = crimson color = deep red.It stand for many things, first of all and most crucially for:ROSES and BLOOD.X {Japan}'s first single was called KURENAI and founded that concept.In Amercian Beauty the symbols of KURENAI always reoccur and make it really interesting in terms of visual art and not only fabula of the movie itself such as the context, the meaning and text. But visually all is bonded by images that are so real and realistic and at the same time magic and special.Really gifted.I wonder if Sam Mendes is an X Japan fan?	5.0	American Beauty and X Japan symbolism	2001-12-13	2	1	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AURZ4YQ270W3T	Mike Freed	&quot;American Beauty&quot; is the story of people who've given up their dreams, their very inner selves, for a lifestyle.To a certain extent, my fellow readers, that describes each and every one of us, and that's what makes this film so haunting and effective. There's a little of each of us in these characters.Anyone who lives in a fairly affluent suburban neighborhood knows people like the Annette Bening character, who prunes red roses with matching red shoes and gardening tools, and who is so uptight about her Martha Stewart-wannabe lifestyle that she won't fool around on the couch (God forbid they stain it).And, yes, I see a lot of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) in just about all of my neighbors, and in myself. How often have we wanted to shuck our jobs, smoke dope all day, buy a red 1971 Firebird, and chase cute young thangs? We all have, folks...fess up. The difference is that most of us never act on it; Lester does, and though it's a pure, adolescent prank at first, it eventually becomes something of a trip of self-discovery that leads indirectly to Lester's undoing.It takes guts to do what you want to do, folks, and sometimes you pay the price, which Lester does...with his life. And although Lester reconnects with himself by the end of his life, he never reconnects with his wife (I suspect he doesn't want to), or his daughter, a girl so desperate for meaning and guidance that it's painful to watch.&quot;American Beauty&quot; is hypnotic for a reason - to one extent or another, it shows us OUR lives. How can one not fail to be hypnotized by our lives on the big screen? How can you not wish you had the guts to do what Lester does?Some have criticized this film for its cynical view of suburbia, but I see it as a challenge to move beyond typical concepts of happiness - all of which revolve around money and belongings in our culture - and decide what's really important for you.I find that message uplifting.	5.0	By far, the best film of 1999...	2000-11-07	5	2	3

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2P5O5PI585D9O	Mike Loniewski	(...)The most common &quot;cutdowns&quot; on this movie arethat the families portrayed in this movie never once express the&quot;wholesome family value.&quot; THAT'S THE POINT! There really are families out there like Lester's, that really have 2 gay neighbors next door. Some young girls really do hate their families. Life isn't all peaches and cream. Not all families tell each other they love them, and hug each other after every meal. This movie is trying to show that. The other knock on the movie is the idea of Spacey chasing after his daughter's friend. This idea of the plot was nessesary. Spacey is learning that he should do what makes him happy, not his materialistic wife. Then when he realizes that what he is doing is wrong, is when he &quot;grows&quot;.  The ideas in this movie have the ability to shatter perfect little dream worlds some people have built themselves into, and those are the people that usually think the movie is about some 40 yr old child molester. For those people, go read &quot;The Cathcer in the Rye,&quot; and call me in the morning. For me, this movie was truly life changing. It makes me want to go out and do something, live life for me, not everyone else. Spacey delivers an astounding performance, most likely the best i have seen him. All of the characters are amazing to say the least, and came together in a seemless masterpeice.  This movie brought me to tears, while bringing me to a new level of thought. See it now, and find out for yourself.  END	5.0	This Movie Changed My Life	2000-04-18	25	19	6

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3IB1W0SVED0Z3	"Mike Powers ""mkp51"""	After viewing &quot;American Beauty&quot; on VHS, and I found myself confronted with the most viscerally negative reaction I can ever recall experiencing toward a film. Two words immediately spring to mind: DISAPPOINTMENT and OUTRAGE.  DISAPPOINTMENT, because the film simply lacks the requisite quality for the manifold awards and laurels it has received, and OUTRAGE, because this movie is billed as a &quot;provocative and wickedly funny&quot; satire, and a &quot;defining achievement in cinematic history.&quot; Provocative, indeed, it is; &quot;wickedly funny,&quot; and &quot;a defining achievement,&quot; it most certainly is NOT!&quot;American Beauty&quot;  is a film which purports to make a stinging social commentary about the barrenness of American life at the dawn of a new millennium, and the need for people to wake up and see beauty in their surroundings.  The vehicle for this message is ironically a pair of dysfunctional suburban families.  Meet the Burnhams:  Lester, a middle-aged &quot;burn-out&quot; at work; completely alienated from his hyperkinetic and overambitious wife, Carolyn, and his moody teenage daughter, Jane.  Meet also the Fittses:  Frank, a retired Marine Corps colonel - a rabid homophobe and an abusive &quot;control freak&quot; toward his voyeuristic, detached teenage son, Ricky, and his semi-catatonic wife, Barbara.In a film which somehow seeks to educate its viewers on the beauty of life, we have scenarios like these placed before us:  Lester lusts after his daughter's girlfriend, a teenager with a wildly scatological mouth. He quits his $60,000 a year job and  takes a  job flipping burgers at a fast food joint, he buys his &quot;dream car,&quot; and he begins smoking pot.  Carolyn begins a torrid affair with a rival real estate agent, a fact which doesn't seem to bother Lester at all when he finds out about it.  Frank forces Ricky to give urine samples to test for drug use, and, fearing that his son is gay, beats on him repeatedly.  Jane begins sleeping with Ricky, and suggests he put her lecherous father &quot;out of his misery.&quot;All this in the name of &quot;beauty.&quot;&quot;American Beauty&quot; is billed as a &quot;wickedly funny&quot; satire.  Now, when I read or hear the word &quot;satire,&quot; I immediately associate it with the word &quot;humor.&quot; That humor can be black, acerbic, biting, ironic, or dry...it doesn't matter.  My point is, I believe that satire, in order to be effective, must be imbued with at least a modicum of humor.  And humor is one quality &quot;American Beauty&quot; does not possess.I find nothing funny about  a 42-year old man engaging in overtly lewd daydreams about, and sexual overtures toward, a teenage girl;  nothing funny about  a homophobic, bigoted father forcing his son to give urine samples to test for drug use, or repeatedly beating on him for infractions of his &quot;rules;&quot;  nothing funny about a man threatening violence toward his wife by throwing a platterful of asparagus at the dining room wall;  nothing funny about a teenage daughter wanting to see her father dead.The only scenes in the entire movie which rise to the level of humor - albeit humor of the blackest variety - are the sex scene between Carolyn Burnham and Buddy Kane, the &quot;Real Estate King.&quot; That, and the scene when newly cuckolded, burger-flipping Lester catches his wife with her aforementioned partner. Those scenes did, in fact, evoke from me a wry chuckle or two.Now, I will concede, that &quot;American Beauty&quot; is an artistically and technically brilliant film. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper, and Wes Bently all excel in their roles. Spacey may even have deserved his Oscar. The cinematography is superb. The screenplay is eloquent and lyrical.  Put these things together, and what you should come up with a masterpiece. Film critics, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the public at large all seem to think that's exactly what they've got...a masterpiece, I mean.Alas, I do not share in that sentiment. For the life of me, I cannot understand why &quot;American Beauty&quot; remains such a critical and box-office success. Throughout this film's two hour, two minute running time, it remained for me little more than a lame attempt at witty social commentary, and a plodding, dreary film which was a drudgery to sit through.	2.0	&quot;American Dreadful&quot;	2000-10-11	71	29	42

The white picket fence can only hide so much from view before the dark secrets are finally uncovered.The Thomas Newman musical score is evocative with a hovering sense of sweet melancholy, yet it has a thoroughly haunting,  icy-edged poignancy that cannot be resisted; it reflectively explores the hollow rewards of the death trap known as the rat race with all of its inherent disillusionment.More than a musical underscore, this is a sublimely eloquent work of art by Newman, perhaps his signature best, so very beautiful that when I hear it, it overflows and I don't know how I can possibly hold it all inside.This is a film that is funny, sad, disturbing and strangely beautiful.This movie is new every time I watch it.

At the end of my first viewing [in Australia] my favourite aspect of the movie was nothing to do with the screen, but the housewives and their childrens comments sitting behind me...""Well maybe that's what goes on in America"". I have since seen the film again to silence my peer critics that insist that the film is brilliant...Maybe i was in a bad mood or something, only to find the second viewing more tedious and flawed.My problem with this film is somewhat by comparison but primarily by my unamusement. I am by no means religious or a ""prude"" or adversed to films with alternate messages.1. What didnt impress me primarily about the film was its complete lack of subtlety. To compare it with another 'suburban indictment', ""Happiness"" from 1998 dealt with the catalystic themes of ""AB"" and far much more and through its impressive direction was able to retain an incredible amount of subtlety throughout, no matter how explicit the theme was. I also felt that use of nudity in the film was cheap, and completely avoidable...which in my opinion is probably the corporate influence ala the major theme of Godard's ""Contempt"". Perhaps this lack of subtlety can be traced directly to Sam Mendes, whose past productions have been theatrical performances and therefore overstated.2. The acting was terrible, in fact i believe that only Annette Benning put in a worthy show. Spacey [a sometimes brilliant actor] mailed in another typical performance fusing both sarcastic and ironic charm [which can be directly found in Orson Welles' portrayal of Charles Foster Kane] but this time came out loser...and of course Thora Birch whose vacant prescence has led her to such 'classics' as ""Dungeons and Drangons"" and ""Ghost World"".3. Predictability seems to be the operative term that buzzes around inside your head when viewing. The 'experienced' cheerleader, the angry militant father whose lifestyle cannot accomodate anything for his ailing son, until he reinterprets his machismo in order to in some way understand his offspring [you mean he kisses a man? wow, how brave]. The executive wife whose life is too busy for a husband. The two outcast socially inept characters who just happen to be  boy/girl and become a couple...etc etc. [thumbs down]4. The Hollywood Acceptance of this film as 'the indictment of american suburban social values' or something like that...oh no, we'd better accomodate this one and show some sort of conscious/conscience thinking...we are people too.In conslusion I do not see this film as the sign of the times. i find it petty, misguided, bleedingly obvious/predictable and generally a snoozefest. For all its glossy surface and attractive reputation, it amounts to nothing and only climbs the ladder that films like ""Blue Velvet"", ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", ""Happiness"", ""Rain"" and ""Bliss"" have created.Don't believe the hype."	1.0	Vicious, transparent pseudo-self indictment	2002-07-07	64	36	28

Nothing can stop him.Behind each door in the suburbs a volatile world exists, on the brink of madness and self-destruction. That's true or American Beauty is just an isolated case. Not likely.The sharp real world that the director, screenwriter and cast display on screen is as pleasant as it is irritating. Pleasant because it shows an acute observation about the American family lifestyle. Irritating because confronts honestly the hypocrisy that usually surrounds life: the modern values, often hollow, the weaknesses that make us adopt behavior patterns that are not part of our personality, the phobias, prejudices, ambitions, the insecurities that we all feel internally.American Beauty tells us that there is nothing no worse than being ""ordinary"". And what is ordinary? An repressed ex-military man who despises homosexuals? To listen to classical music while we are having dinner? The young girl who uses her appearance to create a goddess image, when in fact, is another afraid adolescent? American beauty dares to explore the meaning of beauty through the eyes of its characters; people who are fighting to have courage enough to get on with their life, day after day.The film is directed with unusual skill for a newcomer, with an intuitive camera. The characters or could be living next door to you, or 3 floors above of your department. Their confusion, their poses, their miseries are not unreal.Annette Bening is sensational as Carolyn, the bitter wife who seduces, scratches, crawls, and cries and flatters to desperately grab some respect. Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley shine with their own light as Jane, Angela and Ricky. The rest of the cast is magnificent, you will not find a bad performanceeven with a magnifying glass.But the film is, without hesitations, all about Kevin Spacey. His Lester is like many men, and nevertheless, Spacey makes him unique, authentic. A tragic icon of the American man: ingenious, graceful, witty, pathetic and nostalgic of his adolescence.Lester's changes are not simply a middle-age crisis, but a revelation that there's much more to life that he has obtained from. And maybe, as even Lester will realize after this injection of vitality, he's not a loser, but it's already too late for him to win."	4.0	The fall of the American dream	2005-05-25	0	0	0

JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge"""	A satire about middle-class modern American life, American Beauty is a cut above other satires because it has heart and a complex understanding of its characters. Kevin Spacey, who plays a disaffected, cynical father alienated from his wife and daughter, wins our sympathy even as he tries to reclaim his youth by listening to Led Zeppelin, smoking pot, and flipping burgers at a fast-food joint. His character growth in the film makes American Beauty transcend another nihilistic exploration so that the film's analysis of the American Dream ranks up there with Midnight Cowboy and The Graduate as a masterfully articulated rebuke of our blind pride and infatuation with our middle-class trappings. If you like American Beauty, you might check a less celebrated satirical film that came out the same year and that tackles similar themes, Election. For an even more depressing look at middle-class America, check out the 1997 film starring Julianne Moore called Safe.	5.0	Satire with Heart	2004-12-27	6	4	2

It critiques the stereotypes we Americans have of what is beautiful and what isn't.  ""Plain Jane"" becomes the one seen as the true beauty, and the typical, gorgeous, blonde-haired, blue-eyed Angela is put in her place.  I enjoyed the window scene when Ricky focused his camera on the reflection of Jane instead of Angela flaunting herself.  This scene really made this theme resonate.I liked Jane's character much more than Angela's.  However, both of them define themselves by what men say.  For Jane, Ricky was the one who made her feel like a woman.  I wish that she could have had self-esteem on her own instead of needing a guy to give it to her.  However, most of us women have the same issue, so it is realistic.  I think we all know that Angela relied way too heavily on the opinions of the men around her to define herself as feminine.  The biggest example is the scene at the end when Lester finally treats her as more than a sex object.  She is taught by him to accept herself and like herself for more than her looks."	4.0	ATTN Prof. Majer-O'Sickey	2004-05-12	2	1	1

In addition to that, his family (and apparently everyone on his block) are having breakdowns too.In my opinion, this movie would have been better if Kevin Spacey had just walked on screen for a second and said ""life can be crazy at times, so just slow down and see the beauty.""  In fact, that would have been great in comparison to the movie that it really was.My question is where was the reality?  The story is an attempt to reach out to people and show them something they understand or can relate to.  However, the attempt to do just that though fails because there are too many ridiculous sub-plots thrown in: whether it be pedophilia, insecurity with one's homosexuality, power hunger, greed, and lust, or just a lack of reality with the world.Most of these characters would be labeled insane if checked out by doctors, and none of them having anything in connection to the real world.  Kevin Spacey's character is much more like one of Ayn's Rand's characters in that he is the epitome of selfishness (and I like Ayn Rand).Warning: if you want to see a film that covers a similar topic in a better way then watch Life As A House, but if you want to see what all the fuss is about then ask someone.  Because, watching this movie is more then just a waste of one's time, it is a degradation of one's mind."	1.0	The horror, the horror...	2005-01-07	53	27	26

Kevin Spacey was great as the love him  or hate him Lester, and Annette Benning was also believable in her role.  Everybody was perfectly cast in this film. The only thing I did not like  about American Beauty was the fact I was depressed at the end. Not at the  movie, but the mode the movie puts you in, and makes you look at life at a  new level. I guess that is the point of the movie though, but the movie  feels like something is missing. If you are a movie fan and you didn't get  to see this movie yet, I recommend renting it.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3I1H3RDJM3587	Morgen Moxley	"American Beauty is a spectacular movie of hope and life that has captured the hearts of so many people. Sam Mendes, the director, and Alan Ball, the screenwriter, both succeed in displaying the lonely life of Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man who takes a closer look at the world he lives in, and progresses on a journey to get his life back. The beginning tone of the movie is dull and uninspiring as Lester Burnham embarks on another boring day. He is seen as a prisoner looking out onto a world of beauty, a world that he once knew. He seems to be trapped behind bars everywhere he goes.Sam Mendes was born in Reading, England in 1965. American Beauty was his first feature film in 1999 and it won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. He is now happily married to actress Kate Winslet. They have one child.In the beginning of the movie during Lester's monologue, the audience finds out he is going to die, but at this point he seems already dead. His life is lonely and he has a low and tense relationship with his wife and daughter. Every aspect of this broken family is distant and isolated. Colors are dark and dull except for the red roses that so regularly appear throughout the course of the movie. The roses in the movie represent fantasy and life. The life of a rose depicts the direction of the movie and also the life of Lester. A rose begins as only a seed, waiting to be nurtured and cared for. It then transforms into a bud after it has grown and grown, and is only seconds away from blooming into the next phase - the American beauty. After the rose has had its beauty, it dies, satisfied and fulfilled because not only did it live, it lived a life of beauty.Throughout the course of the movie and the introduction of all the characters, one specific character stands out more than any. Ricky, a teenage kid and the Burnham's new neighbor, brings light and beauty to the suburban family. He influences every character, directly and/or indirectly, and shows them how beautiful life really is. Lester begins to break free from his life of imprisonment and manages to live life without a care in the world. At one point Lester states, ""I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose."" This movie illustrates that there are always preconceived notions about people and life, but in reality, there is usually a lot more going on. People are always searching for meaning in their lives, and Lester Burnham finds that meaning... that beauty.American Beauty is a movie that will surely touch the lives of anyone who should watch it. It is a film that can be viewed by both young and old and never cease to send a beautiful message."	4.0	Touching	2007-09-06	5	3	2

In my mind it is one of the most socio-realistic screen plays that have ever come out of Hollywood - not due to the (perhaps overly) tragicomic characterizations but because each character represents something real in all of us... But maybe that does not resonate with those among us who prefer to see the world as black and white rather than the accumulation of shades of grey we all live and live in.For me this is one of my top10 movies of all time and one of the very few I can watch again and again.	5.0	Enough has been said but....	2008-07-01	5	3	2

It is very disturbing, depressing, and serious.  It's supposed to be a comedy-drama, but if you ask me, it's mostly a drama, not to say it isn't funny, it's just very serious, especially at the end.  They said before I saw it that the movie would get stuck in my head for days.  It concerned me forever.  Of course, they said the same thing for Million Dollar Baby, but that didn't concern me that much, that is, not as much as it would've if I haden't seen Scary Movie 4.  But still, those who haven't seen this movie, see it, it's a great best picture movie.  The acting is great, Kevin Spacey won an oscar for it.

I know i've already said that, but it's just so true, still, it may spook you, not that it's a horror, it is, however, very, well, you know, but it's still a very good, dark film, so give it a chance.	5.0	Excellent, Great, Convincing movie!	2008-12-23	0	0	0

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	When 'American Beauty' was released it brought fresh life into Hollywood cinema (coupled with 'Fight Club' that same year, we were especially lucky).  Directed by English theatre-director Sam Mendes and written with intense sensitivity by Alan Ball it is one of the great movies of the century.  The story of a disfunctional family, each separated by their own wishes for fulfilment and by the people around them may sound dull but 'American Beauty' breathes a different kind of life into it.It centres around the dry Lester Burnham (Spacey), who narrates the story from beyond the grave.  Stuck in a dead marriage to wife Caroline (Bening) and a boring job he witnesses an epiphany in the shape of Angela, the best friend of his daughter Jane.  Thinking his years after high school to be a waste he starts getting himself in shape, smoking pot and even pursuing Angela.  The amazing thing about this movie is that it doesn't merely focus on Spacey but on all the people around him, each with their own dreams, hopes and failures which Mendes treats with a care and sensitivity unusual to most films.  For instance, Caroline may be pushy but she's cracking up inside, Jane has concerns about her body and even Angela is worried that she might not be perfect after all.Another interesting thing is that Spacey isn't the hero as you'd expect him to be.  Sure we admire him, the guy that decides to take his life by the reigns, but we admire neighbour and Jane's boyfriend Ricky (Bentley) even more.  This is because despite being trapped at home with an abusive father and a mother who is intriguingly unhinged he still feels gratitude for all the beauty that the world has to offer.  If this sounds clich&eacute;d, cheesy or pretentious then you obviously haven't seen the film, which displays all this beauty before our eyes alongside all the misery and heartache.  Add the this the implication that Bentley believes in a higher power guiding us may be as much due to his own wisdom as it is to his horrific home life and it becomes a statement of great weight.Of course, the intelligence of the movie is just one of the many things that make it.  The cinematography constantly emphasises the 'life is beautiful' theme, with gorgeous red roses, blood and voluptuous lipstick all vying for your attention.  In addition, it would be hard to find a collection of actors that are more accomplised in the role they play, all giving the performances of their respective careers.  Spacey is even better than he was in 'The Usual Suspects', Bening shows a different side to the career woman of many movie stereotypes, Birch portrays the disappointment of early adulthood perfectly, Bentley is so astute it's almost disconcerting and Suvari is sublime as the Venus-image/frightened little girl.  Add to the mix a dollop of brilliant humour and you have what is probably one of the most important movies of the 90's, quite possibly even the century.	5.0	A masterpiece of 90's cinema	2002-06-23	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1HAL6ZQ8MUJSD	mr_bunghole	Wow, wow, wow.  This is truly remarkable.  I still don't know if this is a movie or a scene from somebody else's actual life.  The performances are flawless - especially from Kevin Spacey, who deservingly received his 2nd academy award - his indifference to all the twisted stuff that happens  around him is magnificent; I'd swear to God that's me in 30 years time.  What makes this piece so interesting though is the myriad of characters  that could be described as 'quirky', they're so much fun to watch.  You  have the average Joe (Spacey), the wife nobody would want (Annette Bening),  the teenage blonde (Mena Suvari) etc.  Everybody is so weird that it's safe  to say that the gay neighbours are the most normal characters in the whole  movie.  This, along with Magnolia, made 1999 a fantastic year for ensemble  pieces.  Both were wonderful movies, but this one is better in that it  doesn't get weighed down by its ambition, and was mesmerizing in that the  direction, the performances, and the screenplay really geled together.  Everybody who was involved deserves to give themselves a pat on the back.	5.0	Can somebody say Oscar?	2000-05-02	1	1	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW	Mr. Cairene	I read somewhere that the overwelmingly red look of American Beauty is a symbol for blood and roses. Represented in the film by the flower petals in  Lester Burnham's fantasies, and the blood spilt when the sadness that  hovers beneath bears its face. The title of American Beauty does not refer  to the pretty surfaces that hide the anguish of these people, but the  beauty of their souls when dealing with that anguish. Many reviewers have  considered the title to be ironic, it isn't.  I've heard Kevin Spacey say  that this film is about context, because taken out of context the behaviour  of these characters seem bizzare and even phsycotic, but out with in the  context of their messy lives or indeed anybody's life, it seems natural. If  I tell you that Kevin Spacey plays a character who is obsessed with the  idea of sleeping with his daughter's best friend, a daughter who constantly  anounces her hatred of her parents, a woman so obsessed with appearances  that happiness is but a memory to her, a loner who makes his living as a  drug dealer with a firm rigid father living in denial about his son and  himself, you would guess that there would be no one to like in this film.  You would be wrong. This film is magical in the way it lets identify with  these characters, care for them and worry about their outcome.  Infact  the ideas of American Beauty are nothing new. The persuit of happiness  through the abanodoning of materialistic possesions and the satisfaction of  primal, animal and natural desires was the exact same premise for Fight  Club. This could be a middle aged version of that film. The family turmoil  closely resembles Ang Lee's The Ice Storm 1998, and like that film,  American Beauty ends in tragedy. But as with all masterpieces its not the  &quot;point&quot; that counts, but how you get there. Just like the fact  that anything new you learn in life is the history you don't know, most  originality in movies is the movies you haven't seen and the novel's you  haven't read. The fact that the film remains a masterpiece is a credit to  the execution of those ideas, not their originality.  Our hero is Lester  Burnham a man who goes quits his job, black mails his boss, and goes wild  for a year. His journey of self-discovery is not what your average citizen  would call moral, yet we still sympathise. My favourite scene in the film  is where Lester meets Ricky(Wes Bently) outside a part. Ricky sells  marijuana for a living and makes a lot of money. Lester tells him that when  he was his age he &quot;flipped burgers all summer long&quot; for very  little money. &quot;That sucks&quot; says Ricky, &quot;No actually it was  wonderful.&quot; The heart of the film is this scene, Lester's yearning for  those years where his whole life was ahead of him, when he believed he coul  do anything, when he wasn't such a &quot;loser&quot;. This purity is the  Beauty to which the title refers.  Ricky Fitts is the boy next door, a  loner who likes to film people. His father is a rigid military man. Both  Wes Bently and Chris Cooper who play father and son respectively give  monumental performance equal to Kevin Spacey's oscar winner. Their family  is a contrast to Lester's, and in its tragedy, emotional complexity and  heart break exceeds it. Ricky's catatonic mother is perhaps what Lester  would have become had he not taken charge of his life.  I have tried to  define this film, but its not a film that can be defined. It is one to be  experienced. If I tell that the sight of a paper bag blowing in the wind  will amaze you, you find it very silly indeed. Acredit then to this film  that when Ricky show us a video of a paper bag blowing in the wind, it is  indeed a breathtakingly beautiful sight.	5.0	BLOOD AND ROSES	2000-04-22	340	292	48

IT IS A WONDERFUL  OCCURENCE THAT THE KIDS OF SUCH FAMILIES COME TOGETHER AND DISCOVER  SOMETHING DIFFERENT, SOMETHING UNIQUE THAT MISSED: WARMTH. IN MY OPINION  THE SUCCESS OF THIS MOVIE IS THE FACT THAT IT COCENTRATES ON ONE TOPIC,  WHICH IS THESE TWO FAMILIES WITH ALL THAT GOES ON, BUT IT CAN GET THE  VIEWER TO THINK DEEPLY AND SPECULATE ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES AND  COMPLICATIONS OF MODERN FAMILY LIFE AND LIFE-STYLE.

The film is about how  they deal with this, with varying and often sharply satirical results.But it isn't the plot that makes this film - it is simply the way it is  made and the incredible acting. Kevin Spacey obviously shines, but Annette  Benning and the rest of the cast easily keep up - all strong, excellent  performances.It is simply a well-made, sometimes challenging, often  comical, always inspired adult tale of modern anxieties.One  of the best  movies of the last decade and a standing testament that no amount of  special effects and fancy CGI (of course, apart from the brilliant  'Matrix'), can come close to an intelligently realised film about  'ordinary' people.Whatever else you watch this year, make sure you watch  'American Beauty' - it is one of those rare movies worthy of its hype.

One of the best I have ever seen.It is fascinating to read the many reviews of this movie, especially the negative ones. To those people I say that this movie is like a mirror depicting American life (Alan Ball himself has said as much.)  Those who didn't like the movie didn't like what they saw in the mirror.  They're going to dislike this statement even more (Why??).  I especially like the reviewer who said that the movie had an underlying, subversive Buddhist theme.  I agree that the movie contains many ideas supported by Buddhist doctrine, but why is that subversive?  I would say more generally that the movie encompasses ideas contained in general eastern philosophy (Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism.)What is this movie about?  If it is about a dysfunctional American family, then 2001: A Space Odyssey is about some guys who take a trip to Jupiter.  How about this for a theme:1.)  Life is suffering 2.)  The cause of all suffering is desireLester Burnham undergoes a process throughout the movie.  This process might be called spiritual awakening or enlightenment. He begins to recognize the transitory nature of everything that he thought was &quot;important,&quot; including his own life.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A27TC5T7DUWTP	Music fan	I am 33 years old and have been going to and renting (after the invention of VHS) films for the better part of 22 years.I also grew up in South Philadelphia, which explains in part the fact that until 1999, my #1 film of all time was ROCKY (Part 1).That all changed after a snowy day in late 1999 when I was fortunate enough to purchase a ticket to see this film.I've easily seen 600-700 movies in these 22 years, many of which were good, some great films, but this one takes the cake.I was hypnotized from beginning to end, and I now own the DVD and am equally hypnotized each time I watch it, almost 4 years later.Kevin Spacey not only deserved the Oscar he won for Best Actor, but if they gave a Best Actor of the decade award, he would have won that for the 90's (and maybe in my lifetime.... since the late 70's).  His character, while a part of a great ensemble cast, was really , in the end, the driving influence of this unforgettable film.Annette Benning was amazing as well, despite the fact that her character, in the end, was not exactly likeable or sympathetic at all.  She somehow ends the film as a somewhat sympathetic figure, which is attributed directly to Benning's performance.The young actors (Birch and Bentley) are terrific in what amounts to a mature film about some very serious subject matter, they shine.The really underrated performance in this film is that of Chris Cooper as Col. Frank Fitts, yet another example of why he is one of our great, lesser known actors.  Thankfully, since this film, he has gotten his notice, and some meaty roles in other big name films.Lester Burnham will forever go down as one of the most lovable and remembered characters in American film history, and American Beauty will go down as one of the 10 best American films ever made.Deservingly so on both ends.  If you haven't seen this film (what the hell are you waiting for), please do so immediately.5 STARS ALL THE WAY.	5.0	One of the few truly deserving 5 star films	2003-02-15	5	4	1

Or maybe I knew what it was all about, but the impact of that knowledge didn't resonate then as it does now, after having viewed it on television and having aged into my early forties. It's a movie about those who abide by or are trapped by the ""structure and discipline"" of life, and those who manage to side-step those social structures as necessary to experience greater fulfillment and awareness of the greater beauty life has to offer, which is usually an awareness we have in our youth, but are not aware then that we are aware of it or that it will later give way to the killjoys of responsibility (i.e., stucture and discipline).I especially like how this film moves from the comedic to the tragic.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AHUT55E980RDR	Neal C. Reynolds	Right from the beginning, you get the message of aloneness of the person and lack of communication in the family.  The filming here is absolutely spellbinding.  You see image after image of the family so eerily apart.  And there is something of this in each person's everyday life.  That's one reason why this film is so darn disturbing.This is not an easy film, and I suspect many viewers gave up on it early, rather than try to meld with it and understand what it's truly about.  And don't expect me to tell you what it's truly about, because I am sure that there's a subjective element here and that film has different messages for different people, if they will open up to receive it.There are touchy issues here, and it is so easy to misunderstand what the movie is saying.  It sure isn't saying that happiness is reverting to the teenage perspective.  Kevin Spacey's character does this, but I don't believe he has really found happiness or satisfaction.  He, and each character here, is seeking in his or her own way to make sense out of the life they are in, and each has moments of frustration.Like so many looks at life, though, this movie presents more questions than answers.  Each somehow messes up, and the question is how could each have done better.  Maybe by melting the separation which is so feelingly portrayed here?Lots of intelligent and well meaning people hate this film.  If you haven't seen it, I would say to see it and form your opinion.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A85K51H02XWZU	Nicholas J. Bertollo	"SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSI love Kevin Spacey.  I thought this film would be a great spotlight for him.I was wrong.There isn't a whole lot in this movie that's redeeming.  The premise is that American suburbia has this look of perfectness and that everybody thinks it's some wonderful place.  The thing that makes AB ""edgy"" and ""hip"" is the way that the modern American family is revealed to not be perfect.  In fact, it's shown as a mess.Well, first off if you needed to be told life wasn't perfect you've got bigger problems than liking this steaming pile of crap.Second, if you think that this film is edgy and subversive and thought that's why it was cool, go watch David Cronenberg's Videodrome.  If you can follow it, you'll get an education in a hurry about what thought-provoking cinema should be.I'll cut to the chase.  The characters in this film are awful.  Not one of them does a d---ed thing to help themselves.  I, for one, do not identify with characters who wallow in self pity and never stand up to help themselves.  And no, Kevin Spacey's character does not deal with his problems.  He runs from them.  He retreats into a shell of adolescence instead of being an adult and handling the situation he's in.  Frankly, he's the worst of the lot.  We've got a stereotypical (that's right, in a film that's so high-brow we've got a hopelessly stereotyped character) homophobic All-American type war veteran.  He's played capably, but the character is and should be an affront to people's sensibilities.  This is how veterans are portayed in this film?  What the heck kind of message is that?  No veteran I've ever met acted remotely like this.We've got a cheating housewife, too.  That's great.  You're not adult enough to handle problems in your marriage so you have an affair.  Wonderful.  So far we've got a homophobic, borderline abusive veteran, an irresponsible mother, and we've got the ""I'll escape my problems by ignoring them"" Kevin Spacey.  Great.So we're basically showing how irresponsible Americans are.  This is original?  I can look out my window and see the same point made for free, and it's less snobbishly faux-philosophic.And if you think it's edgy to look at America as a land of irresponsibility and that this wasn't abundantly obvious already, you've got your head in the ground.Instead of dwelling on how bad things are, we should focus on what can be done to fix them.  American Beauty is content to sit and shout ""LOOK!  LOOK AT HOW AMERICA IS DISINTEGRATING!  LOOK!"" and makes no effort to rectify the problem.  The ending is two kids doing what everybody else in this waste of time seems to be doing - running away.  Stand up and do something about your lot, you poor excuses for human beings!  But no, they'd rather run away than deal with reality.And that's what does nothing but infuriate me about this film.I don't understand how anyone can think this is worthwhile or even vaguely interesting.  I want the two hours I spent watching this back."	1.0	Seriously.	2005-06-22	48	24	24

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3SGZZBAWU68X5	Nicholas Stix	An American neighborhood, shown for what it really is, by an expert Hollywood eye: the miserable businesswoman putting on a phony, cheery face; the &quot;successful&quot; businessman whose life is collapsing; the  degraded husband suffering an extreme midlife crisis, who fantasizes about  his daughter's girlfriends; the girlfriend, a nymphet who likes to seduce  older men; and best of all, the new neighbors, the family of a retired  Marine Corps colonel. Since the colonel moralizes endlessly about the  abominations he sees around him, he's of course a neo-Nazi, his homophobia  a front for his closet homosexuality. Oh yeah, there are good guys -- the  one gay couple on the block are as sweet, virtuous, decent, tolerant and  well-adjusted as everyone else is screwed up, mean-spirited, and  phony.Bad enough, that Hollywood ignorance and arrogance presumes, in  the persons of director Sam Mendes and screenwiter/co-producer Alan Ball to  be telling &quot;the truth&quot; about suburbia, but they think they're  doing Billy Wilder proud. They said so openly at the Oscars. This is clear,  as well, through the gimmick, copied from Sunset Boulevard, of the dead  protagonist's opening and closing narration. Mendes and Ball aren't fit to  carry Billy Wilder's director's chair.For one thing, Wilder --  considered anything but subtle in his day -- wore silk gloves, in contrast  to the hamhanded doings here. More importantly, as cynical as he often was,  he didn't constantly remind you how superior he (thought he) was to his  characters. Well, at least we know that this picture's creators have  healthy self-esteem.Every character in American Beauty is  one-dimensional, a prop in the filmmakers' anti-morality tale. The latter  apparently have an adolescent notion that people are good, only to the  degree that they do whatever they feel like at any given moment.And yet,  the screenplay does have its funny moments, most of which involve Spacey,  the one character (the gay couple can't be counted: their brief,  superficial presence exists only to emphasize the homophobic colonel's  wickedness) for whom Mendes and Ball feel any sympathy. Much technical  skill is in evidence. And the cast does marvelous work. Kevin Spacey, in  particular, gives a performance for the ages, in this otherwise  conventionally PC, Hollywood concoction.Having spent my entire childhood  in suburbia, I know its problems all too well. But Mendes and Ball don't.  Their movie is jaundiced, without the clear-eyed view typical of Wilder in  his prime. American Beauty is an ignorant, self-righteous exercise in  bigotry. In a just world, suburbanites would be able to make movies mocking  Hollywood hypocrisy, something like, &quot;Hey, I  Spend My Free Time and  Influence Getting Murderers Paroled ... So They Can Kill Again!&quot; Oops,  I forgot. That's not a movie; that's real life in Hollywood.	2.0	I know Billy Wilder ... and You're No Billy Wilder!	2000-06-07	51	24	27
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ	Nicholas Stix	"With the video release of American Beauty, now you, too, can rent or own this subversive satire of the hypocrisy, Nazism, and homophobia lurking among the freshly cut lawns and orderly subdivisions of suburban civilization.In American Beauty, an expert Hollywood eye shows an American neighborhood for what it really is: the miserable businesswoman putting on a phony, cheery face; the degraded husband who, suffering a midlife crisis, fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend; the girlfriend, who brags of seducing older men; and best of all, the new neighbors, a retired Marine Corps colonel and his family. The homophobic colonel is of course a neo-Nazi and closet homosexual. Meanwhile, the one gay couple on the block is as sweet, decent, and tolerant as everyone else is screwed up, mean-spirited, and phony.Bad enough, that director Sam Mendes and screenwriter/co-producer Alan Ball, presume to be telling ""the truth"" about suburbia, but they think they're doing director-screenwriter-producer Billy Wilder [alive in 2000, at the time of original publication] proud! They said so at the Oscars. This is clear, as well, through the gimmick, copied from Wilder's 1950 masterpiece, Sunset Boulevard, of the dead protagonist's (William Holden's Joe Gillis) opening and closing narration. Mendes and Ball aren't fit to carry Billy Wilder's director's chair. Indeed, today a young Billy Wilder would be satirizing them and their ilk.Billy Wilder has never shown hatred toward the land that not only made him rich, but which saved the Viennese refugee from being turned into soap by his fellow Austrian, Hitler. And in contrast to the retired Marine Corps colonel on whom Mendes and Ball focus their hatred, see Wilder's affectionate portrait of America's fighting men in his Oscar-winning, 1953 movie, Stalag 17.Wilder -- considered anything but subtle in his day -- wore silk gloves, in contrast to the hamhanded doings here. And though cynical, he didn't ooze superiority over his characters. In Sunset Boulevard, for instance, Wilder depicted faded silent screen legend ""Norma Desmond"" (played by Gloria Swanson, herself a faded silent screen giant in a career-capping performance dripping in irony) as a monster, and yet, she was a monster for whom he clearly felt affection. Wilder, as screenwriter, gave Desmond the best line in the picture, which indicted the Hollywood of his time. When a police detective asks Desmond, ""Didn't you used to be big in pictures?,"" she responds, ""I AM big. It's the pictures that got small."" They sure did.Mendes and Ball confuse glibness and smugness with irony, with every character a mere prop in their anti-morality tale. They promote the adolescent notion that people are good, only to the degree that they do whatever they feel like at any given moment.And yet, the picture does have its funny moments, most of which involve Spacey, one of only two characters for whom Mendes and Ball feel any sympathy. The other character is a young, drug-dealing, peeping Tom -- but he's authentic! (The gay couple can't be counted: Their brief, superficial presence exists only to emphasize the evil of the homophobic colonel.) Much technical skill is in evidence. And the cast does marvelous work. Kevin Spacey, in particular, gives a performance for the ages, in this otherwise conventionally PC, Hollywood concoction.American Beauty has two basic attitudes, each of which is anathema to Billy Wilder's work. 1. Political correctness. Wilder made a living skewering the sort of simple-minded notions that Mendes and Ball prize. 2. Authenticity: Younger fans of this film have said things like, ""It'll change your life!"" They saw the film as saying that most people walk around already dead, but don't know it yet. When protagonist Lester Burnham (Spacey) has an awakening, his life can never be the same.But of course! In an Intro to Psychology lecture in 1978, wide-eyed with wonder, I heard about the philosophy that swept across America, after The War. The brainchild of the German philosopher, Martin Heidegger (1889-1977), existentialism teaches the ethics of ""authenticity,"" of consciously living under the shadow of death, without religious evasions or ""bad faith."" Existentialism's impassioned attack on hypocrisy, has always made it attractive to young people. And yet, its premise -- that life is led only in the face of mortality -- is philosophy's point of departure, not its destination.Had Ball and Mendes known anything about existentialism, they would have known that it is inseparable from ... Nazism!Martin Heidegger's philosophy of life was of a piece with his politics. Like other Nazis, he was disgusted by the hypocrisy of bourgeois life.And then there is American Beauty's embrace of homosexuality, and insistence on an unholy trinity of Nazism, homophobia, and closet homosexuality.One of the obscenities of revisionist, pc history is the assertion that the Nazis persecuted homosexuals, just as they did Jews. In fact, the second most powerful man in the Nazi Party, Ernst Roehm, was an open homosexual, as were all of his lieutenant/lovers. Roehm headed the Storm Troopers, who openly brutalized Jews and leftists. Among many Party members, Ernst Roehm was even more popular than the Fuehrer. That's why Hitler, in an infamous ""night of the long knives,"" had Roehm and his lieutenants murdered.It is understandable that gay activists would want to grind the history of Nazi homosexuality, and those who would tell it, under their jackboots. But Billy Wilder knew all about Roehm and Heidegger.Having grown up in suburbia, I know its problems all too well. And as a Jew who lived for five years in West Germany (1980-85), and once got his nose bashed in by an old Nazi, I know something about the problem of authenticity, too. But Mendes and Ball are strangers to such problems, their jaundiced movie a self-righteous exercise in bigotry and ignorance.In a just world, suburbanites would be able to make movies mocking Hollywood hypocrisy, say, ""I Spend My Free Time and Influence Getting Murderers Paroled ... So They Can Kill Again!"" Oops! That's not a movie; that's real life in Hollywood."	3.0	Father Knows Best	2003-05-23	27	8	19

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2J9FM9PZNDPNP	"""nicktuba"""	"I just watched ""American beauty"" on DVD, and I still draw the same conclusions about this film as I did when I first saw it, three years ago. The supreme talent of screenwriter Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes is evident at every turn. Kevin Spacey is perfect in the role of Lester Burnham, as are Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper in their respective roles. The situations, actions and misunderstandings may seem lightweight and even far-fetched by some standards, but they never seem contrived, and the film offers a distinct look at life within modern American suburbia. The strangest things can happen in the most mundane places, to the most ordinary-looking people, even on a street that you might find anywhere in America.That the film remains dramatic and yet humorous is one of its strengths. The characters may be angry and miserable, but seeing them get the better of each other, their bosses, and others gives the film a satiric quality. But the message is more important than mere satire. Only after you consider the characters, their actions, how they wrestle deep-held apathy and begin to piece together some sort of meaning, do you begin to understand the full consequence of the film's tagline, ""Look closer"".""American Beauty"" is difficult to classify into one genre because it encompasses so many. There's mystery, dark comedy, film noir, and even romance, all set within a cynical, but heartfelt, story. You will also notice the plethora of similarities between this movie and Alan Ball's TV series ""Six Feet Under,"" including Thora Birch's character, the mothers played by Bening and Allison Janney, the Thomas Newman score, and the general mood. If anything, ""American Beauty"" seems like a prequel, or a companion piece, to the HBO series.The DVD itself offers a behind-the-scenes ""making of"" featurette which is too short and, frankly, one of the most unexciting I've seen. I would have preferred to see more interviews of the cast members and the production team, talking about their experiences of making the film. However, this minor drawback does not detract from the overall worth of the DVD; the film's presentation is excellent and on the same level as other, similar disks for movies released in 1999.Like other Oscar-winning films, you might watch this one and wonder, why don't they make more movies like this. ""American Beauty"" is an American classic, with equal moments of delight and tragedy. It evokes thoughtfulness, because it forces you to question your definition of beauty, and what you consider beautiful in life. Beauty, and the interpretation of it, is of key importance in nearly every scene. Watch especially for the reaction of a teenage boy, toward the end of the film, as he directly witnesses the result of a bizarre and gruesome murder. As the denouement of the film demonstrates, beauty is in the eye of the beholder."	5.0	An uncommon film that will provoke thought	2002-10-25	4	1	3

The intricate precision used in crafting each and every scene is flawless.  Whether you liked this film or not, any serious film student should analyze every detail in this movie.What makes this movie so likable, in my opinion, is its aray of unique and 'real' characters.  So many films try to forget that we are all the 'hero' and the 'villian' in our own life story.  Our perception of mean and hateful people are just as easily perceived as kind and joyful by other people in other situations.  What we lack in our mundane everyday lives is the ability to understand and perceive the emotions and motives of other people.  And this movie shows us that in a gradual, very subtle way.....then turns it up strong near the end just in case you haven't yet caught the message.Lester Burnham was a man that finally discovered what life was all about.  He broke out of his mundane world and started speeding toward all his hopes and dreams accomplishing so much along the way.  At last when he understands what happiness really means to him....is when he truly achieved it.  But there's hope to those who failed to see the important message in this movie; as Lester Burnham said, &quot;If you don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry.  You will someday.&quot;  You can actually hear the smile in his voice.	5.0	American Beauty	2004-06-14	3	2	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AM0G4IO57D2Z4	"""ninetwob"""	This film is talking about &iexcl;The beauty&iexcl; as we can know from the title. It states what the beauty is that we think about, through the characters in the film. Lester who works sincerely in his place of work for a long time, his wife Carolyn who is a realtor and his daughter Jane who is a cheerleader in high school, they look all quite normal and ordinary outwardly. It is an appearance of the middle class citizen in America who has a nice car and house. However, it is only an outward figure. Lester is in constant fear when he would get fired by his firm, Carolyn feels embarrassed not to sell the house for several months and Jane is fed up with her boring life.One day a family, which moves into the next their house, is similarly circumstanced. Frank who is a colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps, collects the Nazi-shape carved plates and guns as his hobby, and always keeps watch on his son excessively. His son, Ricky always conducts odd things such as taking a photograph a dead bird or the next house in secret or a vinyl bag, which is blowing in the wind. In addition, he sells marihuana even smokes together with Lester. Ricky&iexcl;s mom, Barbara is also abnormal.Like this the characters in this film have some problems unlike their outward appearance. They appear to be peaceful externally, but internally they do not know that they are holding a bomb, which can explode sooner or later. After all, this bomb&iexcl;s wick begins to be caught on fire as Jane&iexcl;s friend, Angela shows up. In the end, this bomb destroys two families completely at the last part of this film. Since Lester becomes to be attracted by Angela, this family that will blow up some day, collapses and his dangerous relationship with his wife and daughter is shattered.As far as I can see, this film seems to express that the beauty just cannot be called and judged as its exposed outward aspect. The things that Ricky films, especially, the shape of vinyl, which waves in the wind at the fallen leaves street, it seems to imply that hidden meaning. The implications about the beauty that people do not think, feel and see as conventional wisdoms, the director express it from this film. This film begins with Lester&iexcl;s narration and ends with his death. A remarkably frank script, outstanding direction and brilliant performances, on the whole, it is a well-matched film.	5.0	What the beauty is....	2003-01-08	5	2	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	"""American Beauty"" is the story of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a man unhappy in his home life, unsettled with the prospect of growing old and disenchanted with his career. Neither his wife, Carolyn (Annette Benning) nor his daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) respect him and his neighbors don't even know who he is. In short, Lester is a man swimming on the rim of a mid-life crisis. But the tide begins to turn in his favor when Lester decides to throw caution to the wind, blackmail his bosses and collect a hefty buy out settlement.  Of course, Lester's new found independence does not sit well with Carolyn, who prides herself on being in charge of everyone's lives. To relieve her angst, she takes up with rival real estate agent, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) while Jane attempts a misguided elopement with her strange boyfriend, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Of course all this upset leaves Lester free and clear to pursue a relationship with the high school trollop and Jane's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). What is so incredibly compelling about Sam Mendes' masterpiece of reflection, is not so much the way all these lives intersect on a crossroads ultimately doomed to destruction, but how ably the director has managed to capture a slice of the decline and fall of America's constitutional motto of ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""The DVD transfer does a fine job of capturing the stylized color scheme. Colors are rich, bold and nicely balanced. Contrast levels are bang on. Blacks are deep and solid. There is a hint of pixelization that is more obvious during the darker scenes, but it does not distract from your viewing enjoyment. Fine detail is fully realized. Occasionally there is a hint of edge enhancement but again, it is not terribly obtrusive. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a very deep, rich bass, particularly in the music tracks. An audio commentary, featurette and stills gallery round out the limited extras on this disc."	4.0	TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT AMERICAN BEAUTY	2004-06-09	2	1	1

I certainly didn't see why it garnered so much critical acclaim.  Then a funny thing happened...time.  Now in my mid thirties and being a homeowner, I realize I know and recognize many of the characters and dysfunctional behaviors in this film.  I'm familiar with the longing to go back when you felt like your whole life was ahead of you.  My first job was also in the fast food industry for very little money--and you know what?  It was one of the happier times in my life.  Responsibilities weren't so heavy and no matter what my parents just didn't get me.  Annette Bennings's character suddenly have so much depth to me.  The extremes to which people go to hide their personal darkness-isn't satire but reality.  Sure this is a film where you can pick apart everyone's flaws-and there are plenty to go around-but I think one point of the movie is: that we all have them.  We are never what we seem.

Lester lives his life as though dead, apperently afraid to stand up to his own wife.  He is an embarrassment to his family without trying, and he knows it.  As we follow through Lester casting his gaze on his daughters  friend, Angela, to his wife maintaining to be money-hungry  through it all, we begin to understand that all they want is to be happy.  Carolyn (wife) found it with the Real Estate King, Jane (daughter) with  Ricky, and Lester finally with himself (with a bit of help from Angela).  That happiness was found in a plastic bag.  I think that it shows the  trials of &quot;looking normal and happy&quot; for a suburban family filled  with as much dysfunction as yours or mine.  Definitely a wonderful,  wonderful movie.	5.0	American Beautified	2000-03-30	3	3	0

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A341BG8RMH8QW	NotATameLion	American Beauty is truly a fine movie. In vision, insight and execution--few movies can compare with it. Visually stunning, and with an exceptional cast, there is little wonder that it received both critical acclaim and a wide audience. Yet to my mind, this movie is a showcase from the first to the last for the wonderful talent of Kevin Spacey--possibly the greatest actor of our time.Spacey plays the doomed protagonist/anti-hero: Lester Burnham. Check that--Spacey BECOMES Burnham.In this film, more than any of his others, the impact of Spacey's friendship with the great Jack Lemmon is very palpably felt. Not only are there echoes of Lemmon in Spacey's portrayal of Burnham, but one might argue that Spacey's courage in taking on the role of Lester was inspired by Lemmon's own courage in role selection.Spacey's transformation from the beginning to the end of this movie is nothing short of remarkable. Lester becomes a person reborn...spiritually and physically.The supporting cast is also exceptional. Bening, Birch, Bentley and especially Cooper contribute performances that may well prove to be the greatest of their careers. Cooper in particular is chilling, and almost unrecognizable, in a role unlike any other that he has ever played.All that said, what I admire most about American Beauty is its timely message. We live in a world of intense business and illusion. How tempting it is to forget that all of life, no matter how painful or mundane, is a gift. This is the lesson that Lester finally learns. If we stop to look deeper, beyond mere appearances (like Ricky and, ultimately, Lester), Beauty is there to greet us.	3.0	the final days of Lester Burnham	2002-09-04	4	3	1

A perrineal portrayal of everyday people, living everyday lives, doin very everyday types of things that we probably don't like to notice ourselves doing. The fact that Kevin Spacey can fall over walking down a crowded row of bleachers at a basketball game and look like a loser says one thing: how obsessed we are with image. Then we think, &quot;Doesn't beauty rest in image,&quot; and this movie tries to say, &quot;Not the way we think it does.&quot; The wife in this movie makes this painfully clear in the beginning with her matching apron and ratchet: a nice little thing, but hardly beautiful. As the strange adolescent guy next door illustrates, beauty is essentially something inside of ourselves. He illustrates this clearly when he is watching one of his videos, and besides just liking what he sees, he speaks in a stream of consciousness and reflection. Clearly, there is more than meets the eye in real art.This symbolism described is repeated throughout the movie, and little of it is terribly new: a handsome, charming, and succesful man; rebellion by doing something unattractive; or simply deviating from routine. However, it avoids monatony by having each moment delivers something comic and develops both plot and character. It is nearly impossible to feel a lull or that you are not gaining personally from its meanings.	5.0	nicely done	2001-08-13	3	0	3

Just like Desperate Housewives, which was heavily influenced by this movie, Lester Burnham, who died under strange circumstances, make us witness how his family's interactions with new friends and neighbors make them do things they never did before, things that bring forth a tragedy.Secondly, Sam Mendes, with his gorgeous directing, show us the Burnhams lives in a very touching and comic fashion. He creates a dramedy so powerful that even its most funniest scenes, especially in the Burnham dining room, are also the most dramatic. This mix of comedy and drama may not please everyone, will shock and outrage some people, but it adds layers to this drama, which is also a powerful satire on the american dream. Not only that, Sam Mendes gives a more interesting ending. Instead of following the original script, which had trial scenes, tv news, and a big epilogue with a ghostly Lester Burnham flying over his neighborhood, Mendes ends ""American Beauty"" on a cliffhanger and encourages us to think of what we watched, to wonder how a family and a neighborhood will live on after what happened to one of them.Thirdly, Thomas Newman's soundtrack gives a mysterious and eerie atmosphere to the lives of the Burnhams. Scenes that would seem banal under the hands of a different composer, and director, become touching and incredibly moving, especially one involving a plastic bag floating under the wind.Finally, all the actors give wonderful interpretations to their characters, performances that stay in the viewer's memories. All the actors manage to turn their characters into real people, people who we may try to defend their actions, even when they are not the most honorable.In the end, it is such a powerful movie that everyone, whether they like it or not, should see once in their life. Not only to see a great story, but also to take a closer look towards what we may not have looked at in the first place."	5.0	Take a look!	2010-11-19	2	1	1

The hype wasn't misleading; now it is my favorite film of all time.  The story centers around Lester Burnham.  He's living the &quot;american dream&quot; - nice house, nice cars, everything.  But he's bored senseless.  He's alive but he hasn't been *living* for decades.  After meeting Ricky Fitts, his new neighbor, he realizes this boy is everything he used to be and wishes he still could be; care-free, wise, in love with life and happy.  Another person changes his life - his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes.  He falls instantly in love with her and would do anything to have her.  And then he reaches his breaking point - &quot;I feel like I've been in a coma for about 20 years and I'm just now waking up.&quot;  He quits his job, tells his wife off, uses drugs, and wins over Angela.  He drops the banality of everyday American life - wake up, work, sleep, repeat - and becomes free-spirited.  This transformation is inspiring to say the least.Everyone in this movie is perfectly cast.  Kevin Spacey seems like he was born to play Lester, as Al Pacino seemed to be for Michael Corleone.  Annette Benning plays the cutesy, money-obsessed wife perfectly.  Mena Suvari is a good choice for an ordinary teen since she has starred in ordinary teen movies like American Pie.  Wes Bentley does the introverted Ricky perfectly.  Even Ricky's parents are played to the dot.There's a lot of inspiring wisdow here that I hope even the naysayers recognize - &quot;This isn't life, this is just stuff.

It's hard to discuss this film without spoiling a lot of it, which is also what makes this film so great. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a true American hero. He's not stunningly handsome, overly rich, or possessive of a will to make the world a better place. In fact, he seems to be the anti-thesis of the term. But his spirit is what has made him one of my personal fictional idols. After he realizes that his life is pointless, he ventures down the road of enlightenment. To him, this means blackmailing his company, lifting weights, fantasizing about his daughter's best friend, and smoking pot like he did in his better years. It is the outrageousness of his new hobbies that make this film so hilarious. It seems to be more of a drama, but you will definitely fall over at points. It seems that the point of the film is that freedom is not the successes of responsibility, but freedom of doing whatever it takes to be happy. To some, this may mean becoming a serial killer or a degenerate, but to Lester Burnham, it's all about listening to rock n roll, smoking pot, cruising his vintage Firebird, and causing domestic havoc with his family. It couldn't paint a more accurate picture of what American suburbia has become to many of its citizens.The acting is superb, and it offers real humor along with a solid plot with a good moral.

The director, Sam Mendes, comes straight from Broadway, and you can tell. The movie feels like a play. It starts out with Spacey  narrating, giving us a tour of his town &aacute; la &quot;Our Town&quot;. The  direction has its good and bad points. The acting is terrific, but the  movie feels claustrophobic. Perhaps you are supposed to feel trapped on  that stage of suburbia, but that conflicts with some of the aerial  cinematography that would suggest otherwise. In any case, this is the story  of a failed marriage and a father who tries to become close with his  insecure daughter who ends up dating a creepy guy, so perhaps this might  not be your best choice for a family outing.

This movie makes you do exactly what the advertisements say which is to LOOK CLOSER...This movie opens your eyes to the seemingly normal families living in the suburbs of America. This movie tells the story of the Burnham's, Lester(played masterfully in an academy award winning role by Kevin Spacey) the family Patriarch who is in love with his high school daughter's best friend, Carolyn Burnham(in a stellar performance that was academy award nominated, by Annette Benning), who is a real estate agent, with aspirations to be as big as the supposed ""KING"" of real estate. The Daughter of this couple is played very well by Thora Birch. The acting in this movie will leave you dumbfounded saying ""how can someone act like that"".This movie is an instant classic with inventive supporting characters, Ricky the marijuana selling, videotaping neighbor. He videotapes everything he can and seemingly has explanations for all of it. The psychotic, image obsessed friend of the Burnham's Daughter(played by Mena Suvari) who says she would consider having an affair with Lester.The bottom line is that this movie is probably one of the best movies in recent memory. It will leave you wanting for more and you will want to watch it again and again.  Sam Mendes in his directorial debut could not have done a better job with this film.

So Lester and Ricky become friends as Lester occasionlay checks up to get more drugs from him. And one night, at a baskeball game, Lester meets Janes best friend, Anglea, who he then finds a purpose to exist in, and she spends the night and Lester is hooked at he has wild fantasies abou ther and rose petals. So the story leads up to the conclusion where Ricky's dad, who is an ex marine core man, spys on his son and BELIEVES he is giving Lester a blow job and he wont let his son turn into a homosexual ( cleaning up the language a bit ) and tells him to get out. Mean while, Lester finds his wife chesting on him with Buddy and he doesn't really care, their marriage is for show, to show how perfect they really are, when they are any thing but, and Anglea and Jane have a fight because Angela wants to sleep with Lester, and he gets just that, almost, but, Anglea tells him that she is a virgin, and so the story goes....The end, when Lester is talking about his life, that actually brought me to tears ( I swear to you ) and I thought it was so moving. I look back now and I still think it is extremely well written and filmed. My dad said that this resembles MARRIED WITH CHILDREN, except with no comedy. This has to be one of the top movies of the decade. People have their own oppinions, and say this movie sucked, and I will not argue, I only ask you do as the motto says, and look closer because a movie as beautiful as this deserves more than one look....."	5.0	Dark, comedic, romantic, cruel vision into Suburban America	2003-11-05	3	1	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2QDD6OWIAEBED	"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883"""	"American Beauty though visually appealing, well acted, and quite entertaining in many places, is still a very troubling film experiance to suffer through. It is a film that tries to pass itself off as a realistic piece, but is in actually hypothetical to a fault. It is as if the writer, Alan Ball, decided to pull a bunch of ""What ifs"" from his hat. What if there was a high level administative type guy entering his midlife cricis, so he dicides to say ""Bite Me!"" to the man, quits his high pressure job in favor of a fun fast food environment, starts smoking a lot of pot, buys the muscle car of his dreams, then begins getting buffed out in an attempt to have sex with his daughters hot young cheerleader friend? What if this mans wife thinks that her husband is an inadequate closet case that deserves little more then contempt, so she undermines the realationship and has an affair with the number one realter in her city? ( played by Peter Gallagher who has made a carrer out of playing the adulterous other man) What if the new next door neighbor to this same man happens to be a starched militant drill sergeant who is in actuality a repressed homophobic homosexual with an unwholesome tendancy to fly off the handle in violent outbursts of uncontrollable rage? It can be argued that these "" What ifs"" I speak of are merely the results of good fiction writing, but that excuse does not explain the rather questionable behavior of the characters in this farce. To better explain my point let me now ask you, the reader, a little hypothetical question of my own.Lets say for the sake of arguement, that you were over a close friends house chatting in the upstairs bedroom, as their father sat downstairs by himself in a darkened kitchen. All of a sudden you hear the unmistakable explosive sound of a large caliber hand gun echoing through the house from the very location of the said father. So now your friend and you in sure panic hustle down the stair case with your hearts pounding in your throats anticipating God knows what, only to find your worst fears realized. Your friends father is hunched over a blood and gore coated table, deader then a doornail with a sizable seeping hole in his head, and an eerie smirk frozen on his dead face. What would you do?A) Would you flip out and go hysterical and possibly run down the walk way screaming blue murder like the poor maid who discovered the butchered bodies at the Sharon Tates house?B) Or would you study the dead body like an exhibit at the Smithsonian, and smile back at the smirking corpse while your friend does nothing but act all nonchalant about their freshly murdered father?Unfortunately the fine people who brought you American Beauty did not answer A, they figured that B, was a suitable ending for this fine story. Believe you me, the sigh of dissapointment I let out in the theatre was heard 10 rows back. To make matters even more dire, they also chose to have the murderer be the militant homophobe next door, talk about problematic representation of sexuality, according to these guys, homosexuality might as well be a mental illness that brings with it the confused desire to kill any straight person who snubs their passes, YIKES!! My second sigh of grief was fallowed by a rather lenthy profane grumble of disgust. As a result I have only seen this film two times, once in 1999 at the theatre, the second time about four months back in an attempt to give this film a second chance. The result is obvious, the same sence of betrayal I felt still prevaded any enjoyment that the situations may have provided me in this film, overall the film was killed by its hypothetical cliche's.P.S. as a side note, I think that Meg Griffen from the Family Guy played the role of Kevin Spacy's daughter in this film, but don't hold me to it."	3.0	Don't believe the hype-othetical!	2006-06-18	13	4	9
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1YCERMZ0BXVEL	Paul Asher	"I remember hearing the buzz about this movie when it came out in theaters last year. I had planned to see it, but for some reason never got around to it. One year and five Academy awards later the movie ""everyone"" was talking about is out on video, so I decided to see what all the whoopla was about. I'm one of those people who is really picky when it comes to enjoying certain movies. Because I'm sick of all the Hollywood clich&eacute;s and the ""ooooh, ahhh, special FX without a plot routine."" Well...American Beauty seems to be a remedy for all the crap that is Hollywood these days.  Returning home from Blockbuster I popped in the video, turned the lights down and for some reason felt I would be disappointed once again. Needless to say, 123 minutes later as the last part of the credits rolled up and the screen turned blue I was still staring at the TV, completely enriched within my thoughts and contemplation's of American Beauty, the movie `everyone' was talking about. I mean, to put it briefly, this is one of the best movies of the 90's, one of the BEST MOVIES EVER!! Just in my humble opinion. Never, since Schindler's List or the original Star Wars has a movie been able to engross me in such a story. I mean WOW!! I have so many positives for this film. Basically the movie focuses on Lester Burnham(Kevin Spacey) who is having kind of a mid-life crisis going on. Since the movie is narrated from his point of view, we can better understand what he's going through and what his thoughts are. In the beginning of the movie he comes to the rationalization that he's trapped in a meaningless and depressing marriage. His wife (Annette Bening) shows more admiration in her career and affair with her boss than him and his daughter (Thora Birch) who basically hates them both because...well because she's a teenager. While attending a basketball half-time show to see his daughter cheerlead, Lester goes into a trance when he catches the eye of his daughter's friend Angela(Mena Suvari). The 42-year-old man immediately falls for this 18? 17? year old girl. That seemed to be the catalyst to Lester's transformation. He dreams about this girl day and night and for that reason turns into a completely different person. He stops worrying, and just starts living life to its fullest. His new goal is to get into the pants of his daughter's friend and start acting like he was when he was a teenager. While his new personality may make him happy, it's making the rest of his family miserable, which builds up to the great climax. This movie just isn't about the life of Lester though; it also digs deep into the emotions of the people living around him and next door, with everything coming together at the end. This is one of those films that is hard to review, one of those films that you can't really describe in words why you like it, only in words why you dislike it. Many of my friends didn't like this movie because they couldn't accept the protagonist as a pedophile. But the girl isn't exactly a youngin' or anything, and I think the majority of people could relate to Lester's hardships. This movie has just a little bit of nudity and probably one short sex scene. I don't see how it can really offend anybody THESE days unless you work for the Christian Science Monitor or something like that. Or maybe it's just the fact that Scary Movie has given me so much shock value that I've become immune. Anyway, I recommend this movie for anybody looking for a solid 2 hours of entertainment, with good acting and great cinematography."	5.0	A Truly Unique and Thought Provoking Film	2009-09-20	1	1	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1WEWCU8OXLZO2	Paul de Senquisse	That word could sum up my first experience of this movie. I remember that for the first time in my cinephile life, I was litterally floored, unable to stand up from my seat. Everything in this movie was perfect, from the soundtrack, to the actor's play (Kevin Spacey offers his best in this moving drama of a not so normal, not so static life), but what really stuck me was twofold. First, the director had evidently the exact same vision of beauty that I had, everything visual in there was an artful masterpiece of color and beauty. Second, this vision of beauty was also the same poetically. The scene with the flying bag, and the memorable ending monologue are scenes that brought tears to my dumbstruck eyes. This movie profoundly affected me, and I know I had been changed when I exited the theatre for the first (but far from last) time. The DVD captures this masterpiece as best as a not-viewed-in-theatres support can, and this is a movie that should be in everyone's DVDtheque.	5.0	Dumbstruck	2002-09-30	1	0	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AWFPO0SDMD4QR	Paul	Although American Beauty is a terrific film, I am giving this DVD 3 stars because of annoying technical problems and the overall feeling that this disc was put together rushed and incomplete.  These problems were confirmed on 3 different DVD players.  I know this isn't a &quot;special edition&quot;, but still, there could have been more to this release.  The graphics work on the box and the disc itself is simple, nothing to get excited over.  There is no booklet included, just a simple pamphlet with an introduction by the director.  As for the film itself, I think it's wonderful, with excellent characters portrayed by great actors.  OK, so, when I popped the DVD into my player, I was greeted by a screen asking me to pick the audio I prefer.  Where is the MAIN menu?  Where is the choice for 2 channel Dolby?  Anyway, I chose 5.1 channel.  It then went through the Dreamworks logo and THEN it went to the main menu.  Huh?  The main menu now gave you the choice of 2 channel Dolby.  I was confused.  Was this a problem with the disc?  Did the producers want it this way?  Personally, when I put a DVD in my player, I want to be greeted by the MAIN menu.  OK, enough of that.  As for the picture quality, the widescreen image is excellent.  Colors are vibrant throughout the film, and the excellent cinematography is beautiful to watch.  However, I noticed during the first 8 minutes of the film, that the extreme left side of the frame was dirty.  Black spots were noticeable during this period.  This is probably not due to the DVD transfer, but it is a problem with the films negative.  (Am I being too technical?)  If this WAS a problem during the DVD transfer, I hope this will be fixed.  The sound was quite pleasing.  The music and dialogue were recorded beautifully.  The DVD is not an amazing sound experience to test your home system with, but overall, the sound is pristine with beautiful atmosphere and crisp. clean dialogue.  The musical score sounded amazing.  The supplemental material is less then thrilling.  It includes 2 trailers, audio commentary by the dirrector and writer, cast and crew info and production notes.  The DVD has audio commentary during a storyboard sequence by the director and cinematographer.  This storyboard sequence was disappointing because it was a bunch of static pictures with voice-overs, not a video sequence.  It got boring rather quickly.  The DVD does have some behind the scenes footage and interviews in a segment called &quot;American Beauty, A Closer Look.&quot; (not much behind the scenes footage, but some...I would liked to have seen more.) The DVD also contains CD-ROM material for your PC.  In conclusion, I would recommend this DVD only if you enjoyed the film in the theater, or if you've seen it and want to rent it.  If you are looking for a DVD packed with tons of extras, I'd wait for a &quot;special edition&quot; of this film, hopefully containing tons of extras like deleted scenes, more behind the scenes footage, voice-overs by cast members, interviews, etc.  The film itself is wonderful, but this DVD is rather &quot;ordinary.&quot;	3.0	American Beauty-A rather &quot;ordinary&quot; DVD.	2000-11-02	13	9	4
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ	Paul McGrath	"This was going to be yet another in a long, dull line of Hollywood diatribes against the stultifying, boring and banal existence of suburbia as they perceive it.  It starts off that way.  Kevin Spacey is 14 years  into a job he loathes, he can't communicate with his wife or daughter, and  everything in his life is dull.  His wife, real-estate agent Annette  Bening, is obsessed by success.  She begins her day by repeating some stock  motivational phrase:  ""I will sell this house today;  I will sell this  house today.""  She ends her day by almost breaking down when she doesn't.  Their daughter is an uncommunicative selfish brat, who hates them both.  This story is so hackneyed and these characters are so insipid that the  first part of the movie plays as a dark comic romp.But then Kevin  Spacey perceives beauty.  It is in the form of his daughter's cheerleader  friend, a blond-haired teenaged nymphet.  He is obsessed with her, lusts  for her, dreams for her.  Her beauty, this beauty, changes him.  He begins  to dismantle the life which he has lethargically allowed to be constructed  around him.  ""When was the last time you felt joy?"" he desperately asks his  wife.""You're going to spill beer on the sofa,"" she replies.In the  meantime, their daughter has become infatuated with the next door  neighbor's kid, who himself is fascinated by videotape.  He shows her one  of his favorites.  It is nothing more that a piece of trash, a plastic bag,  blowing around in the wind.  But he perceives beauty in this;  an order;  a sense of calmness;  a benevolent force.  In fact, he sees beauty in  everything.  It sometimes overwhelms him.Kevin Spacey finally realizes  this too, in the last moments of his life.  That there is beauty around us  in every single day of our lives.  A white cloud against a blue sky, a  green field in the spring, a woman's face, a baby's cry, a piece of music,  a young girl, a bag blowing in the wind.  We must open ourselves to this  beauty, for there is something incredibly important behind it.  A  benevolent force.  A kind force.  It tells us to relax, to enjoy.  To not  be afraid.We are loved."	5.0	Beautiful Message	2000-05-14	48	38	10

I cannot understand why this  picture was considered a masterpiece. It is well crafted, but into what  category does it fall? It's not a whodunit, its  definitely not a comedy ,although there are comic bits scattered  through it. I would put it in the black  melodrama category myself, though  a Shakespearean  type of tragedy might  be a more appropriate description. Supposedly it is a satire on suburban middle class life, with all the usual clich&eacute;s about  material well-being not bringing happiness, and as portrayed in the film it seems to bring about the opposite results.  Imagine, indeed, if you were a rural Ethiopian, for example, watching this movie, you would be totally confused, you would wonder that with all the portrayed wealth and opportunities how  can  the characters be so fatally unhappy? The characters  portrayed have extremely ugly personalities, with the exception of the two male homosexuals in the community (three if you count the man next door who won't admit his homophilia),  but who only have a reflecting role in the film anyway. Admittedly the acting is superb, though I preferred Kevin Spacey in his role in the much superior and sensitive ""Shipping News"" movie.Essentially, ""American Beauty"" shows a married  couple in the prime of their  lives who have convinced themselves that they are losers. What makes the  film worth watching  is how the main characters  react in different ways  to their assumed situation.  Indeed,  most of the  grown up people in the movie appear to be  psychopaths. Naturally, the children  of these psychos are mixed up in various degrees as well. If the play  is supposed to be anything like  a true portrait of the average white  middle class family in the United States then,  God Save America!"	3.0	American Nightmare	2006-02-17	11	5	6

Great, great, great, and so was the rest of the movie (except the ending kind of sucked, but it's hard to see how it could have ended any other way, and besides, from the very beginning you know he's telling us his story from beyond the grave).It's the angst of suburban life, domestic tragedy, and social commentary played with biting sarcasm that drives this picture, with Kevin Spacey coming unglued with a case of delayed adolescent lust for a very pretty cheerleader, played by Mena Suvari). Annette Bening plays his uptight materialistic, real-estate agent wife to absolute perfection; you just LOVE to hate her. And then there's their teenage daughter going through more than the usual teenage girl stuff and playing her utter contempt for both parents to a tee. It feels like she's not even acting, especially in the excruciatingly tense dining room scene.And then there's the really creepy neighbor...and there wouldn't have been a movie without him.Wow, what a coup.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ACTEKUQIV8SKE	Personnalit- ( S. Robert Tod. )	"This film is not to ordinary people! It is a film to the same people capable of understanding films like ""Blade Runner"", La Dolce Vita, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump and others masterpieces.It is a film to people capable of discerning between something good and bad, people that read truly good books and listen to truly good music. ""It is not to people that like films with Chuck Norris, Jennifer Lopez, and Madonna, and consider both Sylvester Stallone and Madonna respectively the best actor and actress ever"".When I saw this film for the very first time I recognized immediately his value, it is a portrait of a complete alienation of the modern life where the next step is just stay acting all the time as if the life was a ""B film"" with a very poor script indeed, and the worst thing is that you look at your side and see that everybody has been acting the same ""B film"" with the same poor script.What happens in this case is that the character of Kevin Spacey discovers one day this reality and tries to recover the meaning of his life, but he knows that this means to get away from this style of living, just getting rid of the life he has been living for years and this is not an easy thing to do. Watching it is like to be put in front of a big mirror. Soon people around him start to react against his sudden liberty and their final achievement is to eliminate him as a kind of a vengeance, because his real liberty was too aggressive to their hypocrisy. In the end he is assassinated for the same reason those ""two bikers were assassinated in the film Easy Rider"", because he is ""Too Free"" and has been showing to the others their futile and useless way of living. Is a very courageous film. Bravo, The script is terrific, ""and some scenes are pure poetry"".It is sad to read reviews of people saying that don't like this film because of some sexual scenes, in a country that is the major producer of pornography in the whole world, what is the prove that this film is right, we have to change this society immediately."	5.0	American masterpiece.	2007-04-19	6	5	1

There is so much to love about this film. Both Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning are fantastic in the film. The soundtrack is also excellent. Thomas Newman (I've never heard of him before the movie) does a  lot of the music and it's great. The dialogue is superb and there are  almost no scenes that are unenjoyable. Truly an entertaining film, as well  as one rich in theme. You will laugh and cry and think many times  throughout the film. My only complaint would be that we didn't see Lester  pre-midlife crisis enough to sympathize with him more. They sort of just  plunged right into his troubles without establishing how his wife mistreats  him, how work [is lame], how he is distanced from his daughter. But a minor  complaint.

You've already seen the rave reviews from critics and fans.  A great masterpiece on lives that are unfulfilled by living the 24/7 suburbia lifestyle.  A smart criticism of the shallowness that exists in American life and behavior.  Great moments such as the homophobic Marine displayed as a closet gay.A little annoying with it's premise based in &quot;yuppie life.&quot;  For instance, the college kid that carries around a camcorder,  the usual yuppie suburbia cliche of a fairly successful drug dealer, etc...  The important part though is that if you are not someone who has lived this priviledged lifestyle, you can still relate to the characters and their search for truth in the world.  The director deserved the Academy Award.  I can't think of many motion pictures that had this much smoothness to the scenes.  (Even more brilliant when you consider the director was working in an extended portrayal of normal suburbia life.)But I'd also like to tell you about the Awards Edition inserts.  A HUGE disappointment and the main reason I'm lowering this to four stars.  There is a 10-15 minute clip that is excellent with a focus on the director, writer, produers and actors.  But the other two segements are junk.  There is a 10-15 minute clip that is comparable to an Entertainment Tonight clip.  The other 40 or so minutes is dedicated to the director reviewing the story boards for the movie.  Each three picture panel is reviewed on average five minute each and is a great source for sleep. :)  It contains much addolation from the movie makers on how well they pulled off a certain scene from it's story board picture to the actual film, some brilliant insight, but a rip-off.  The &quot;Making Of&quot; portion is a let down.DO NOT MISS this movie though.  A great piece of film making.	4.0	American Beauty (The Awards Edition)	2000-12-29	15	11	4

The perfromances are stellar all around.  You feel like you know at least one of the characters and that maybe that is your dad, or maybe you had/have a friend like that in high school.  I know the first time I saw it I said &quot;I 'know' that person.  The plot is so simple and yet complex at the same time.  The people start off one dimensional but by the end they have evolved and turned 180 degrees, but I don't really want to go on about the movie.  I want to talk about the disc.The two previews are great.  After watching them I felt like playing the Who.  The narrations are really top notch.  I do wish one or two of the actors (Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning) were on it but at least we got Alan Ball to talk about his script, as well as the director.

I watched this movie several months ago, and approached the whole thing with an open mind, which was probably a good idea as this is not a conventional film in many senses, that's maybe why it's so good. It's the story of a normal dysfunctional suburban family, could be like many others. But the lead character suddenly, rebels, breaks the stereotype and in doing so refuses to be downtrodden anymore. If you like it's about the rise and eventual fall of this anti-hero and how anyone of us in the that situation could do the same. It has the feel of a few other recent movies following a similar track; Fight Club would be another example of this, another one of my favourites. As with this film it asks the question ""Do things have to be this way? And why should we live as others would see us and want us to be"" Definitely a refreshing change from the usual strain of mainstream movies, and the fact that this film was awarded an Oscar is proof of that.  It's not a bitter movie, as the story may suggest, it just emphasises the things around us that over time we may have forgotten. The main character if you like awakens from a slumber of the last 20 years to finally see and appreciate the simple things around him which can give his life purpose. It's a simple idea, but then the simple ideas make the best movies, and this is one of the very best. Watch it whenever you can, it's a simple complicated story of human nature."	5.0	The Rise of Middle America	2001-02-02	3	1	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A122VI5VXWBBXH	P. Jason Kirk	There's something special about &quot;American Beauty&quot; that's hard to pinpoint. I don't think I've ever seen a film with such a great ensemble of actors - everyone is perfectly cast, from Kevin Spacey's eerily lovable  Lester, to Annette Bening's loopy real-estate broker Carolyn, to Thora  Birch's hauntingly disenchanted Jane. And the Fitts family...whew. Don't  even want to go there.It's one of many films lately dealing with the  disparity between appearances and their underlying realities. Lester's  abrupt break with his superficial world is refreshing, and the chaotic  circumstances that evolve from it are both provocative and entertaining. I  think that, along with &quot;Fight Club,&quot; &quot;American Beauty&quot;  is the best of them all. The beautiful cinematography, outstanding  percussion-centered score, precise and evocative *original* screenplay, and  above all first-rate acting make this movie stand above all the others.  Thinking about the fact that this is Sam Mendes' first film, and Alan  Ball's first screenplay, gives me hope for the future of film in America.  Not every movie has to leave you nauseous.	5.0	Oscar finally gets it right...	2000-04-04	93	76	17
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	American Beauty is possibly the darkest black comedy ever made.  The movie follows the midlife crisis that Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) goes through.  Lester seems to have the perfect suburban life, a pretty wife, nice daughter, perfect house a good job.  But he is far from happy.  Lester hates everything about his life.  He goes to see his daughter cheer at a high school basketball game and sees the nubile, young Angela (Mena Suvari).  He is taken aback by her beauty and has a fantasy involving alot of rose petals.  He ends up quitting his job (getting a great severance deal through blackmail), buys a muscle car, starts jogging and lifting weights to get in shape and takes a job working at a fast food burger joint.  His wife Carolyn (Annette Benning) is an aggressive real estate agent who ends up having an affair with a rival agent, The King (Peter Gallagher).  She can't understand Lester and is constantly nagging him.  Meanwhile their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) starts a relationship with their new next door neighbor, Ricky (Wes Bentley).  Ricky is an intensely weird kid, he films just about everything (including Jane) and just so happens to sell pot.  While Jane &amp; Ricky are becoming more intimate, Ricky is dealing dope to Lester.  The movie is one of the strangest, funniest and disturbing films to come along in along time.  Mr. Spacey is absolutely brilliant as Lester.  He brings along for Lester's meltdown.  Ms. Benning is equally as good as his wife.  Mr. Spacey deservedly won his second Oscar and first Best Actor award for the role and the film took home the Best Picture award and the Best Director award (Sam Mendes), who films the movie in an heavenly aura and uses an impressive soundtrack and a Best Screenplay award (Alan Ball) for it's twisting, original script.	5.0	American Meltdown	2001-02-02	7	2	5

I didn't hear the hype first. I sat in that theatre absolutely riveted to my seat. Regardless of those bad reviews  other people have done, you simply must check this movie out for yourself.  Quit reading this trashing and hype. Do yourself a favor... when you watch  this movie, imagine yourself as a critic, like Siskel and Ebert. Look for  the use of red in the film's cinematography. Watch the angles used on  steps, which is like a Hitchcock or Orsen Welles' film. Listen to the tight  dialog. Watch for suburban satire subplots. There are a ton of things this  movie speaks to. Watch for it. Like The Usual Suspects (another great  Spacey film) this movie is simply gripping. For many, you will find its  pedifile overtones disturbing. Others will reject this film because they  are homophobic. Others may simply reject this film because although  hilarious, it has some VERY dark and disturbing undertones. Regardless, it  is a MUST SEE. Rent it, and if you love it like most of the reviewers here,  get it on DVD for the supplimental materials. I can't wait to hear the  directors' comments during the film, which comes on this DVD. If you are  still in Tape-land, do yourself a favor and buy a DVD player, then buy this  movie and the Matrix.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ	Private Quentin Tarantino Fan	My intial reaction of American Beauty was not really.  It took me a long while to think this movie over, and I must say that American Beauty is a movie that will deliver again and again.  It's not as realistic as people make it out to be, but American Beauty easily transcends these petty complaints with acting, themes, film making.The acting is top notch, and a joy to watch.  Kevin Spacey is brilliant, this is the one that made me always keep my eyes out for any movies that he is in (of course, not all of them are good, but that's not the point).  Just watch the facial expressions, the anger, and the bite that these people put into their lines.  Few movies include such stirring performances, which is just one reason why I can never stop watching this movie.  The fantastic acting is further driven by a script crammed to the brim with top notch dialogue to boot.  Oh sure, it's not Quentin Tarantino, it's better (well maybe not, but it's brilliant).  It's not as rich as his dialogue, but pretty much every line on this is biting, sad, angry, and emotional.  Of course, there's plenty of lines thrown in, to well, you know, add a sense of realism, lines necessary to communicate.(come on, there is no such thing as a person who speaks in non-mundane his whole life).  Thank god, thank god.American Beauty is not a visually striking film in the vein of Fight Club or Eraserhead (especially on first viewing), but once you study the movie a bit and listen to the INSIGHTFUL commentary, the film making aspect will impress.  The camera angles, the lighting effects, the use of all of these is a testament to the expansive pallet of film-making.Another extremely strong point that adds to the movies emotional effects is the absolutely fantastic soundtrack.  I'm not talking about the soundtrack of other artists, which doesn't exactly feature a soundtrack on the par with Quentin Tarantino's mix tapes (though it features some good songs).  I'm talking about Thomas Newman's brilliantly exotic, maudlin, and sentimental score.  It's rife with exotic percussion instruments, and it transcends the movie into a somewhat mystical aura that's utterly jaw-dropping at it's best.  If there's anything that makes the pretentious paper bag scene stike a chord in the firm believers (it's a nice tune to listen to on my own without the paper bag scene _______ up everything).American Beauty really a movie that, despite it's out-there protagonist and psycholigcal leanings, delivers again and again, thanks to fantastic direction and entertainment.  The film can be critized, but it's hard to ignore the many assets this movie has.  And of course, the bonus features only add to the movie, especially that commentary.  It's one of the best movies of the ninties, especially coming from a decade with such movies as Pulp Fiction and Silence of the Lambs.  Absolutely worth watching.Also, the Boston Celtics logo rip-off is probably the worst thing I have ever seen in my life.  Give me a break. Can you at least rip the logo off of the Sacramento Kings or the Los Angeles Clippers, or even the Utah Jazz (Lakers will be NBA champions!!!!!)?  Celtics deserve more respect than that (Being a Lakers fan, I respect and even like the franchise and it's players.  Some of the fans are a different story).B+	4.0	And To Think I Got This For Five Dollars...	2009-04-23	3	2	1

No pitchers struck him out often, either. This was a rare treat for a  baseball aficionado like myself. Recent Holywood movies are replete with fantasies or mega-scale spectacles. This movie is a story of the life of a middle-class American family. It is an Ichiro of movie.It will give a sheer delight for those who appreciate details. God is in the details, as someone said (Michael Crichton's &quot;Disclosure&quot;). I saw this movie several times back to back and still enjoy it from time to time. Direction is good, considerate and tender, and so is camera. Storytelling is excellent (every scene is needed and no scenes are wasteful), and so are dialogues and the character growths. Resolution is extraordinary and compelling. Casting is super. Reading its Shooting Script (the same title, also available from amazon.com) gave me an added delight. No wonder it was given Academy Awards in five categories. Now, this version comes with a bonus footage, which is also entertaining and instructive. This movie is a rare treat for those who love sutleties of human emotions. Yes, I rate this movie five stars, because this is the highest grade that is allowed. ( I seldom give such rave reviews. I do not trust movie critics, either, especially after they put down that excellent movie &quot;Halfmoon Street&quot; (Sigourney Weaver and Michael Cain), which is not even available from amazon.com.)	5.0	This is an Ichiro of the Holywood movies	2001-12-15	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ATIXN319QZSO9	"P. Wilde ""Picnic"""	The image that got a lot of people interested in this film was that of Mena Suvari lying back in a bed of roses. What endeared it to sensitive souls was its' masterly use of score and mood. Sour-faced critics and others loved its' likeness to 60s satire- its pithy put-downs & side-swipes at the suburban 'American' dream. All these things are known about American Beauty- 'The Graduate' is its' closest forefather. But I would like to look closer. Spacey and Benings' performances have been praised enough- but this is an ensemble film. Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley are all excellent. What? the critics might say. Sure, they're ok at highlighting the vacuous of American youth but they're not that interesting- that's what they're thinking. This utterly fails to understand what American Beauty is about. By that criteria, the adults are just as vacuous- concerned with a sofa, their body, the car, the house, the image. It is more complicated than that. Chris Cooper's character's repression manifests itself in heavy-handed discipline. We see his  wife, kind but blank,  as blank as Lester Burnham  is beginning to feel, just as Bening cries in quiet desperation. Ricky Fitz tries to find meaning in art and nature and, in him, Janie has found somebody who mirrors her own dark nature but who, to her, seems to have an overwhelming confidence in his own abilities- confidence she lacks for she is a suburban rebel, discontented at herself and her parents more than the world at large- she is part of the Nirvana generation. Like the others, she craves personal happiness. What we see in the film is how adults can become radical while their children are conservative and vice versa- tension rides throughout the film  punctuated by violence, sex and dark humour. But those who purely see it as a damning indictment on sleepy suburban mall-going America are forgetting that, throughout, it shows you that there is beauty, emotion, and dreaming in the apparently mundane , like an Edward Hopper or Rene Magritte painting. It's intelligent, light, dark, sexy and funny.	5.0	Intelligent, light, dark, sexy and funny.	2003-08-27	3	2	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3H2ZKN9FH8O5N	"Rabo Karabekian ""Zach"""	American Beauty is a complex film to understand.  On one hand, it appears to be a critique of American suburbia.  On the other, it seems to be a message of hope.  In the end, I think it is important to remember both.  American Beauty has a duality designed to show us that which is wrong with our world in addition to all that is worth saving.The major focus the of the critique on the modern suburban lifestyle is the isolation it leads to.  The characters are shown more often invading one another's privacy than in healthy, confident interaction.  There is one scene, for example, that shows Lester spying on Angela and Jane who are also being recorded by Ricky next door who, in turn, is asked for a urine test from his father.  The Burnam's family dinners show us another example of how isolated from one another the characters feel.  Their passive-aggression turns into contempt and even violence.Yet through all this, American Beauty must also be seen as a story of hope, and I think Ricky Fitts approaches a messiah-like role in that story.  While Angela first gets Lester's blood flowing again, it is Ricky that awakens Lester's mind, not merely by being a drug dealer, but by providing the first confident human interaction Lester had had for years perhaps.  It is Ricky, too, that helps Jane overcome her lack of self-confidence.  Finally, Ricky gives the speech, echoed by Lester in the end, that reveals his belief in an benevolence behind everything that wanted him to know there was nothing to fear.The duality, then, of American Beauty is by design.  While it tells a tragic story of a family falling apart after years of isolation, it is more about communicating a message that hope lies beyond the material-driven life of overconsumption and rather within each human themselves.	5.0	American Duality	2006-04-11	6	5	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2B8G7W3JXKMZA	"Randolph Bradley ""RBJ"""	This is my opinion: AMERICAN BEAUTY is an ordinary film.  Not particularly good or bad because this has all been said before about life in general.  For example, THE RULING CLASS (1972) starring Peter O'Toole, shocked England as it portrayed the aristocracy as depraved and God forsaken.  Robert Altman's A WEDDING (1978) with Carol Burnett portrayed dysfunction in American upper classes the same as HOME FROM THE HILL (1960) with Robert Mitchum and George Hamilton and CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF (1958) with Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor, etc., etc.  Thus, dysfunction has been portrayed over and over again and with undisputed critical acclaim.  Perhaps what makes AMERICAN BEAUTY so interesting to so many people is that they themselves are either young (20ish) and going around for the first time, or they never had the opportunity to think freely when that was the thing in the 50's and 60's (remember the hippies?) and freethinking is finally mainstream.  Consequently, AMERICAN BEAUTY gives them a chance to look at social diversity (which is commonplace) without censure.  Whether they went away accepting homosexuals, latent homosexuals, or platonic/sexual love paradoxes, there is nothing new in AMERICAN BEAUTY other than standard movie fare.  Get it?  Moreover, it is my opinion that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences selects the picture of the year based on what-to them-has the greatest social relevance for that particular year.  Go figure.  Lastly, an upper class American lifestyle perhaps isn't so beautiful after all.	3.0	This beauty paradox is universal	2000-10-04	7	4	3

Lawn Dogs perhaps examines bourgeois/suburban paranoia and complexes with better skill.So what does work at all? Perhaps a non-American directing, or the eccentric boy across the street who turns out to be the most interesting character. Oh and a couple of mildly funny jokes.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1I402ZA0P1TBP	"""rcompet1"""	American Beauty is an example of director Sam Mendes' unconventional approach to film making. He takes Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey, and launches him into the deepest midlife crisis, perhaps ever seen on screen. Spawned from a lusting over one of his daughter's, Janie's, played by Thora Birch, friends Angela, played by Mena Suvari, Lester finds himself in a new world. He blackmails his boss, becomes friends with the boy next door Ricky, who also happens to be Janie's love interest, buys a sports car, starts working out, and smoking pot. He has amazingly contradictory moods, as he goes from subservient husband to demanding his `proper' place in his family.It is through Ricky's camera lens that Mendes' want us to see the beauty of everything in the movie. With Lester's obsession with Angela and society seeming to point out everything about her as perfect, one would assume she is what is supposed to be beautiful. However, Ricky's lens focuses on Janie. He sees her as beautiful, and makes her feel that way. The Roses in the movie show up every where in the Burnham household, and the vibrant color red as well, pointing out where Ricky's camera does not, that beauty is everywhere. There are roses in every room, in every scene whether people are fighting, or reflecting upon something. Mendes uses Ricky's camera as a tool to reveal the deeper meaning to things normal society may not see, such as Janie's beauty over Angela's.While unconventional, Mendes does and excellent job at revealing the underlying power struggles and beauty in his characters lives. Between Lester's fight for dominance over his wife, and the strategic placement of roses this movie certainly portrays much more than it appears to just on the surface.	4.0	more than meets the eye	2004-05-11	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1LDIMQISH07WK	Rebecca	AMERICAN BEAUTY is a rare, unique and original film that can only be made at least once a decade. It's dark with a lot of twists and yet, at the same time, lighthearted and humorous.AMERICAN BEAUTY takes place in a modern-day suburban American town. It basically revolves around two particular families living next door to each other in a quiet neighborhood. The first family: the Burnhams - Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening), and Jane Burnham (Thora Birch). Lester is the father, and he is going through a mid-life crisis. He has even fallen in love with Jane's new friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) by her beauty. Caroyln is the perfect mother who has to have everything perfect - everything and everyone. Jane is the rebellious teenager who can't seem to appreciate anything her parents give her or do for her.Family number two: the Fitts - Colonel Frank (Chris Cooper), Barbra (Allison Jenny), and Ricky (Wes Bentley). The Colonel Frank is the father, a retired US miltary colonel who is hard on his son - to the point of abusive - and even though he claims his son is a homosexual, he is actually a homosexual himself, though you don't really find that out until the end. Barbra is mainly silent throughout this film, and doesn't have a lot of lines so you can't really know what her character is like, though she often forgets and is lost in her daydreams a lot. Ricky is the son, and he films everything that is beautiful or interesting to him - which is how he and Jane meet, because he was filming her all the time. He also is very confident and calm about everything, and is afraid of his father, though he never likes showing or admiting it.A beautiful film about a man in his mid-life crisis and falling for the beauty of his teenage daughter's best friend. The ending is very surprising, and the film didn't really live up to all of my expectations....The bonus added stuff to AMERICAN BEAUTY is really good, but couldn't they have just added the special edition stuff to the same video tape as the movie itself because then this wouldn't have to be a double video. Oh well. This is still a very good movie, and I really recommend it. But I don't think it really deserved all those Oscars. I really think THE SIXTH SENSE still should've won Best Picture.

""American Beauty"" is an original screen play of 1999, directed by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. Life is a beautiful thing and many people overlook just how beautiful it is. While I have always been a victim of this, Mendes and Ball definitely illustrate the importance in looking closer at life and doing what makes you happy. The extreme personalities are what make the movie's point more clear. While it is easy to lose passion in life trying to adhere to the bigger picture, nothing feels better than waking up, taking control of one's life, and recreating joy.This is a tale of how a man turned his miserable life around and turned everyone else's upside down as a result. I found a couple of reviews that were helpful in understanding this movie. The first review by Paul Papadopoulos sees the movie as supposedly being a satire on suburban middle class life, with all the usual clich&eacute;s about material well-being not bringing happiness, and as portrayed in the film it seems to bring about the opposite results.  The other was written by Michael J Edelman and he summarizes the movie as being plotless, from the beginning we're told by the narrator that he's a dead man, so from that point, we're just waiting to see how exactly he dies.In the 1990s, there were many cases of midlife crises because people would feel compelled to do what is best for their family, even if it meant unhappiness for them. At this same time children need positive role models. Edelman says Spacey's character decides to stop caring about success and becomes infatuated with a teenaged girl, but I think Lester finally realized he had lost his passion and become unhappy, when he met this girl. It is not as much about him not caring about success, as it is that that life made him unhappy.  In this movie the idea of happiness has a sort of irony because while it is clear that self-fulfilling happiness is what Lester seeks, the way he portrays this happiness is not my definition of being happy.  Edelman sees no complexity in this movie, but I think the idea here is that it is important to control life and be happy with everything. The problem is that Lester is not a positive example of this because overcoming his midlife crisis leads to drugs and other bad examples that would not make him a good role model. It is the sexual fantasies Lester has of a 17 year-old girl that led him to realize that he had numbness for life. This is an ugly personality. Papadopoulos is right, ""The characters portrayed have extremely ugly personalities, with the exception of the two male homosexuals in the community. The others are very crazy. If the play is supposed to be anything like a true portrait of the average white middle class family in the United States, then God Save America!"" I completely agree, how many typical people do you know that blackmail their bosses? Yet, right after Lester does this, the viewer sees him walking out and being the happiest he is in the movie. He stood up to his boss and gained a self-fulfilling happiness. He went and got a job flipping burgers, and this made him happy. I would not be happy about that. Another scene which shows Lester's new happiness is where he decided not to carry out his fantasy and have sex with Angela. He realized that was not really what he wanted, he had a self-revelation. He realized he was trying to relive the past, and he could not do that anymore. From that point he would have been a great character. The thing to remember is that there is a message displayed, unlike what Edelman says. Once Lester has regained his control on life and become this bad role model, he appreciates the beauty in his life. After death when Lester says, ""I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me... but it's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst... And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life... You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry... you will someday."" This is an optimistic message which says take control, look closer, and try to be happy. It is just said by an adult who exhibits drug usage and [...] fantasies. I think each Burnham displays a case where by the end of the movie they had found something that helped them go from completely miserable, to having a purpose. Carolyn is shown as being very miserable. The viewer sees her hit herself often, but once Carolyn started having the affair and using a firearm, even Lester noticed how see was looking better. She was releasing anxiety and that made her happy. When Jane realized she loved Ricky, it did not matter how her friend felt about it. In the scene where Jane chose to go with Ricky and not stay with Angela, the viewer sees her at her happiest point.After watching this movie, I realized I need to look closer at my own life and start doing what makes me happy. I think this message is a good one, enjoy life. Make sure to look closely at life and make sure you are genuinely happy with it, and for that reason I strongly suggest watching this movie. I think the only negative aspect of this movie would be the character personalities, but often a positive message is best realized with negative actions."	5.0	Good Message, Bad Role Model	2006-04-03	1	1	0

It's meaning and lesson goes so deep that sadly, many people (esp. those who gave it a bad review) were lost as to what it's meaning is.  While I'll state again that this movie is amazing and my all time favorite, I have to warn that if you are interested in watching a movie simply for thoughtless enjoyment- this is not your type of movie.  While it does have a lot of humor, it is more intellectual and far from the slap-stick comedy commonly presented today.  This is a truly enlightening film and brilliantly done, but it is not for everyone, though I recommend you see it before you rule it out as &quot;over rated&quot; or &quot;not your type of movie&quot;.  I think that this movie also can not be fully comprehended with just one viewing, so I suggest that if you didn't get it the first time and are not completely turned off, watch it again.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"Souls are bared and individual vulnerability is exposed in this film in which the dysfunctional family becomes the norm, and a man at last confronts the fact that his life is simply not as it should be, and determines to do something about it.  ""American Beauty,"" directed by Sam Mendes and starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, rips the facade from a typical American family to reveal a not-so-typical family after all.  Or are they?  For who among us, living in this finely woven tapestry that is modern American life, can really define ""typical?""  Or for that matter, ""normal?""  In what is to be the final year of his life (though he doesn't know it), Lester Burnham (Spacey) finally acknowledges to himself that he is in a loveless marriage, has a dead end job, and has for some time (too long) been a mere observer, rather than a participant, in his own life.  His wife, Carolyn (Bening), a fledgling real estate broker, disdains him, and his teenaged daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), accords him nothing but disrespect.  He has a new neighbor, Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper), a U.S. Marine who is the virtual embodiment of the ""Corps,"" with a wife, Barbara (Allison Janney), he has disciplined into a trance-like state of existence, and a teenaged son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), who sees beauty in the least likely of places.It's a stylized, thought provoking film in which Mendes lowers the mask and raises a mirror to reflect the true nature of a society too often willing to cast the first stone while refusing to first seek out the detritus in it's own eye.  Devoid of stereotypes, the characters herein represent a realistic and concise cross-section of individuals who form, not only the periphery, but the core of that very same society.  And though personal experience and frame of reference will go far in determining how accepting a viewer may be of this picture of urban misalignment Mendes presents, there is no denying the reality of the attitudes and situations represented here.  To deny this depiction as accurate would merely be a turning away from the truth.Once again demonstrating that he is one of the finest actors around, Kevin Spacey deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Lester.  It's a finely tuned expression of a middle-aged man, not just in crisis, but lost in soul wrenching turmoil.  Many may find it difficult to sympathize to any great extent with Spacey's Lester, but regardless, they (as well as those who are able to sympathize with him) will at least be able to identify with him.  For in Lester we find all of the variances and complexities that make up this journey we call life.  And Spacey captures it all, from Lester's apathy and ambiguity, to the emotional peaks and valleys of his epiphany, with a truly memorable performance.Annette Bening, also, turns in one of her best performances, for which she was nominated for Best Actress.  She shines as Carolyn, a woman repressed and frustrated who hides her discontent with hyperactivity and denial, and puts on a mask of pretentiousness that is so animated at times that it's nerve-wracking to watch.  But it's a great piece of acting, through which she certainly brings her character to life.Giving a performance that demands mention, as well, is Wes Bentley, who achieves an introspective depth with his character that establishes what a tremendous ability he has as an actor.  This is one young man from whom we can expect great things in the future.The supporting cast includes Peter Gallagher (Buddy Kane), Mena Suvari (Angela), Scott Bakula (Jim), Sam Robards (""JB""), Barry Del Sherman (Brad) and Erin Cathryn Strubbe (Young Jane).  A cutting-edge character study, ""American Beauty"" is a probing and revealing contemporary fable that is uncompromisingly honest; probably too honest for some.  It's a film that refuses to allow the viewer to take an ""ignorance is bliss"" stance, and instead insists on a truth that lays waste to hypocrisy and self-righteousness.  For when you're forced to stare into a mirror, there is only one image you're going to see staring back; and whether or not you like what you see is going to be entirely up to you.  And therein lies the real impact of this film."	5.0	Uncompromising Character Study	2001-04-09	4	2	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A12X2J7AVZ04IQ	"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan"""	I've read some of the other reviews, and they blab away the plot. I won't do that. What's important is that this is a first screenplay from Alan Ball, and he deserved his Oscar. Sam Mendes put it all in perspective, and brought a brilliant cast to fruition. A lot of this is about middle-age angst, but there are terrific insights about current young person's issues. Wes Bentley is wonderful, as is Thora Birch, and, later, Mena Suvari. The film really centers around Kevin Spacey and he deserved his Oscar. Some may take issue that Annette Benning should've won. (She lost to Hilary Swank, who was in almost every frame of &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;)Phenomenal extra characters, and Chris Cooper was exceptional as Bentley's gung-ho military father (nominated for a SAG award). Peter Gallagher hasn't had as good a role since Altman's &quot;Short Cuts&quot;. His scenes with Benning are amusing.The plot twists are plenty, and the ending already told at the beginning. The problem with the current DVD is that there were alternate endings, not included; and it would really be fun to find out other things might've been going on.  The resolution was so open-ended, I'd love to see what Mendes &amp; Ball had in mind as alternatives. Awards Edition? OK. A real edition? That might be fun.	5.0	Brilliantly written film...	2004-07-04	6	4	2
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2D3D0KBXOV1FU	Richard	"The first reason why I enjoyed ""American Beauty"" is that much of it really gave me a good laugh. Granted, at first sight, the movie doesn't necessarily come across as a comedy: we are presented with dysfunctional  couples which are terrible role models for their children, with the blatant  irresponsibility of the protagonist, with the frequent absence of moral  values, with the complete phoniness of the protagonist's wife, with the  casual delinquency of the neighbor's son, and with the rather serious  psychiatric problems of the neighbor and his wife. The big picture is  therefore far from pretty (with the notable exception of the homosexual  couple, which seems almost oddly healthy). But aside from all this  bleakness, what irresistible humor! I will only mention the scene where  Kevin Spacey is caught masturbating by his wife, and then decides to admit  it with a vengeance... I also liked the rush of freedom which allows the  protagonist to regain his taste for life. Of particular interest, I found,  was the way in which he abandons all that to which he previously attached  an undeserved amount of importance, and reorients himself toward new  priorities that are much more meaningful to him. As such, he delivers  himself of a lot of the pressure which society used to put on him. And in  his getting beyond what previously determined his behavior, he begets the  power which comes with the knowledge that he has in fact nothing to lose,  and becomes truly able to exercise free will.  Even his uptight and overly  materialistic wife gets a taste of this newly found freedom when she finds  out, as per her lover's recommendation, that she enjoys shooting a gun.  Unfortunately, this discovery is far from sufficient to allow her to really  make progress toward self-actualization and fulfillment, and her identity  remains fundamentally truncated and full of conflict, as shown in the two  scenes where she slaps herself when she cannot help crying. The protagonist  himself doesn't make much progress as a person, as he actually regresses  back to an idealized version of his late teenage years (made of sexual  fantasies and/or conquests, equally sexy cars, masculinity-enhancing  workouts, pleasure-inducing dope, and above all the least possible amount  of burdensome responsibility). It is only when he relinquishes the prize of  the beautiful blonde's virginity, and when, only seconds before his violent  death, he rediscovers the picture of his family taken some ten years  earlier, that he starts longing for a more adult life. In fact, the  character who seems the furthest ahead along the path of this interior  freedom is none other than the neighbor's son, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley),  in the sense that he is the one who is most authentically himself. He is  master of his emotions, and is not the plaything of neurotic anxieties (in  his relation to authority, to women, to the forbidden...); he consciously  chooses what deserves importance in his eyes and, as such, he has his own  set of values (he does deal drugs, but not hard ones); also, his outlook on  the world is wholly his own, and he knows how to cultivate it.  This  outlook happens to be very interesting, because I think it gives a  philosophical dimension to the movie. Let's briefly review the facts: 1) he  films a dead bird because he finds it ""beautiful"", 2) the day he found a  homeless man who had frozen to death on the street, he found that beautiful  too, and he even felt that God was looking at him through this dead body,  and 3) according to him, the most beautiful thing he has ever seen is a  plastic bag whirling around in the wind. It seems that what he finds  beautiful in the physical confrontation with death is the fact that it  allows him to appreciate more than at any other time the real value of its  absolute opposite: life. This character actually finds in the vision of a  corpse a source of deep wonder at the unfathomable mystery of life, which  one day sprung out of nothingness, and one day goes back to it. The bag  which dances in the wind is possibly even more beautiful, in that it is the  gratuitous and fortuitous expression of the creative spirit which has the  power to give life.  What was beautiful to me as a spectator, was to hear  the character say that his intimate perception of the existence of such a  benevolent force in the world had allowed him no longer to be afraid - to  free his life from fear. What we catch a glimpse of here, then, is a  particularly liberating form of therapy through spirituality... Clearly  though, this is not meant to suggest that we adopt the same definition of  beauty for ourselves - Ricky Fitts remains definitely too strange to be  seen as a model character -, but rather it seems to be an open invitation  for each of us to search for what, in this whole wide world, has the  ability to touch our soul, and to make us feel more alive. It doesn't  really matter if this quest brings us to film plastic bags, as long we  individually find this sensation of being vibrantly alive, and that we  share this experience with our loved ones, as does the character with his  girlfriend. Otherwise, we are meant to understand, we run the risk of  eventually saying the same words as Kevin Spacey: ""In one year I'll be  dead, and, in a way, I already am""."	5.0	The beauty is in the message	2000-04-27	9	6	3

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2KY59ME58XBWL	Richard Till	American Beauty is by far the most intreguing film to come out in 1999.  Not only were the performances great, the story itself had layer upon layer that made everything just click.  Kevin Spacey does a marvelous job of portraying a middle-aged man who is fed up with his job, the only  excitement in his marriage is choosing what music to listen to at dinner,  and has lost touch with his once sparkle-in-his-eye daughter. Seeing his  life, his moments of inspiration and the way he fights to get some dignity  back in his life is truly a marvel to behold. Annette Bening's character is  also just as rich, even if not so believable.  Movies don't need to reflect  actual life; we see enough of that every day.  This movie takes a viewer  inside the lives of one suburban family and says many things that I feel  most people think, whether they would like to admit it or not.  This is not  supposed to represent actual life; it represents how life could be.  And I  feel this movie represents that better than any movie I've seen in ten  years.  I walked out of the theater feeling an aray of emotions, but mostly  feeling a little better about myself for seeing this movie.  Hopefully, you  will too.	5.0	American Beauty	2000-03-23	7	6	1

And what good parts  they are, too.Kevin Spacey, as lonely husband Lester, again shows us  just why he wins so many awards. His performance is so perfect, everything  that comes out of his mouth is instantly believable. I'm not a fan of  narrated plot advances, but when the narrator is dead man, these advances  take on added dimension. This is not only the best role of his career, but  one of the best roles on film. Notice when he realizes the  cheerleader-whore of his dreams is in fact a virgin. You'll see!The last  10 seconds of Annette Bennings' &quot;Carolyn&quot; say more with no words  than most roles say in an entire film.

I didn't realize just how good she was until I saw  her  here.The members of the &quot;Fitts Family&quot; (the new family next  door) do such fine ensemble acting, they give underscored meaning the the  term &quot;Dysfunctional&quot;. Wes Bently (Ricky Fitts) is going to be  huge! He  makes his camera weilding freak turn from mernacing to adorable  in 5 seconds - with not a word spoken! That's acting. When he see's a  chance to leave his schitzo Mom and homophobic ex-soldier Dad by pretending  to be gay, your heart reaches out in every direction. When the consequences  of this deception surface, you will be horrified! Not a simple  accomplishment in just 15 minutes of filmaking.This film succeeds on so  many levels. I don't generally like my comedy fueled with so much Drama, or  vice-versa, however, great acting - writing and directing, when executed  with such  symbiosis make this one of those films from which any student of  life will learn.After all is said and done, Mendes proves that it's not  values or morals that realy matter.

I know it's been said before, but it is truly in the eye of the beholder.  That is what we find here.  Spacey sees beauty in simplicity.  His daughter sees it in the individuality of her neighbor.  Bening's character finds it in success, and cloak-and-dagger affairs. The gay neighbor and distanced wife see it in the Leave it to Beaver ideal.But the most beautiful character of all is the artist, who pulls together the most coherent, stunning, socially critical film on a level with Fight Club.

It presents a wonderful introspection into the thoughts and actions of what life has become for much of the american people...  A middle aged man, unfulfilled by his job and desperate for something new, exiciting, and different, a woman who tries so deperately to achieve perfection and exude a (false) image of perfection and self-confidence, an insecure teenager that hides her confusion and emotions behind her beauty and her friend who struggles to realize her beauty and identity, a dictatorial homophobe military man that turns out to be gay himself, and much more...What I love about this movie is that is points out significant contradictions in the value system of american society.  Keven Spacey's wife in the movie is so obsessed with exuding perfection, confidence, and success - none of which are consistant with reality - that she practically drives herself mad... and in the end the man she idolizes - ""The Real Estate King"" - turns out to have a disfunctional relationship and is imperfect himself.

This film is a warning to us about the breakdown of families consumed by careers and materialism.  That's one of the themes, at least.

American Beauty never ends for me. It continues on with the rest of the characters' lives. Characters who have been transformed, redeemed, evolved and shocked from what might have been terminally depressing life trajectories. Who were the winners in this movie? Who were the losers? Were there winners and losers? Explain. Where will each of the main characters be in 3 years? In 30 years? Great stuff!Usually when a film is as linear and unambiguous as this I soon lose interest.

The film IS good, downright hilarious at points, almost in the vein of Pulp Fiction.  Kevin Spacey is very good, outside the unnecessary opening shower scene.  The film does have some very thinly veiled anti-American themes.  Some examples include the depiction of nuclear families as groups of dysfunctional freaks and those with ""alternative lifestyles"" as ""with it"" and ""happening"".  Further, hatred for the United States Marine Corp and those who exercise 2nd Amendment rights reveals more about the agenda of the film's makers than an even remotely accurate portrayal of American suburban life.  I would have less problems with these P.C. messages, which I've come to expect from Hollywood, had the entire film been a comedy (which it truly should have been) or if it was being faithful to a book, but I can find no evidence of the film being based upon a novel.

But this one had overly stereotypical characters and little originality.One of the worst examples of this was the white middle class houswife/real estate agent trying unsuccessfully sell a house. She over acted the part of the phony, foolish salesperson who did not connect with the customers. To maximize her white suburban foolishness, her skeptical customers included an Hispanic couple, a black couple, and what appears to be lesbian couple.The scene of her with the difficult lesbian couple was stolen right from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, when Judge Reinhold's character was waiting on two difficult gay customers in the fish joint, while wearing that ridiculous pirate uniform.The difference is, Ridgemont was funny.

As for the story, Mendez seems to have been making it up as he filmed it, and when he doesn't know what to do next, he throws in a sex scene. Most of the sex scenes are okay, that is they stop short of really grossing you out. I think everyone misread this movie.  It seems to aim to be a satire, but turns out just to be a lame comedy.  You can't really like anyone in the story, certainly neither of the teen-age girls, who are probably pretty typical, nor any of the adults.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"If you've ever wondered what life was really like in the Ozzie and Harriet household after the cameras stopped rolling, ""American Beauty"" might well afford you a good indication.  Although this is certainly not the first glimpse into the dark underbelly of modern suburban life - films like ""Ordinary People"" and ""Blue Velvet"" long ago shattered any myths about the subject - ""American Beauty"" is clearly one of the grimmest and least compromising.  Writer Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes paint a disturbing portrait of a family and a neighborhood in serious moral crisis.  They transport us on an often painful journey to a world whose residents lead lives of quiet desperation cozily hidden behind the tranquil faade of tree-lined streets, white picket fences and exquisitely manicured lawns and gardens - a neighborhood and, perhaps, even a family not too unlike some of our own.In his Oscar-winning performance, Kevin Spacey stars as Lester, a 42-year old man suffering a major case of mid-life angst, stuck, like so many other men in his age bracket, in both a dreary, meaningless job and a dreary, meaningless marriage, in his case to a consumer-conscious wife whose personality has long since been drained of the passion and spontaneity that once defined it.  Lester also has an alienated teenage daughter who suffers from feelings of worthlessness and a consequent inability to relate in any positive way to either her parents or the materialistic life they have made for her.  Feeling utterly empty, Lester begins to become infatuated with his daughter's beautiful blonde schoolmate, an obsession that leads to pedophilic fantasies as well as tortured feelings of unrequited passion.What is remarkable about the film is that Ball and Mendes don't concentrate merely on Lester's problems but manage to weave a full tapestry of suburban despair by shifting their focus to a wide assortment of other characters as well.  Many of the secondary characters, who could easily have slipped over into stereotype or caricature, actually are allowed to breathe and develop in three-dimensional ways.  Thus, we come to understand that, in her own way, Carolyn, Lester's wife, is just as unfulfilled as he is and just as unsure of how to cope with that bewildering situation.  Jane, his daughter, is just a good-hearted kid who craves affection and moral guidance from parents who seem too self-possessed or too emotionally burnt-out to provide her with those needs.  Like so many of today's youth, she suffers from feelings of inadequacy because she doesn't measure up to society's view of ideal physical perfection - her main goal in life is to undergo breast augmentation - and she really only wants to find someone who will love and accept her on a deeper, more spiritual level.  This she finds in the form of Ricky Fitts, her strangely ""different"" next-door neighbor, a boy who spends his life filming his experiences and whose amazing self-confidence and self-assurance inspire others to label him psychotic and Jane to fall in love with him.  Ricky is, perhaps, the most controversial element of the film because his blatant drug dealing never seems to come under any moral censure by the film's makers.  After all, at least Lester eventually backs off from his planned conquest of Angela, the seeming nymphet, at the last moment.  She also is revealed as a complex character, a girl so afraid of being ""ordinary"" that she devises an entirely fictional persona to present to a world that, ironically, really doesn't care about her anyway.  In a way, Angela defines the theme of the film, in that it seems to suggest that there really is no such thing as ""ordinary"" in terms of human existence and that we all spend our lives in a fruitless attempt to achieve or at least replicate it.  Of the entire cast of characters, Ricky's father, a homophobic, hardnosed ex-Marine, perhaps suffers from the worst case of just such self-denial and emotional repression.  Thus, he becomes the device through which the final tragic outcome is eventually set into motion.All involved - writer, director, actors, cinematographer Conrad Hall - deserve immense kudos for their moral courage and their technical expertise.  Still, one begins to wonder if all these thoroughly dire views of suburban life are really any more true or accurate than the preposterously sunny portrayals of the 1950's.  Isn't it possible that the truth may - as with all aspects of life - lie somewhere in between?  ""American Beauty"" takes us to a particular place filled with a particular group of people.  As a result, it is safe to say that, while it provides ""a"" vision of modern suburban life, it is yet to be shown that it provides ""the"" definitive vision.  Like all great art, it offers only a part of the overall picture - but that part, in this particular case, is profoundly disturbing and truly unforgettable."	4.0	often shattering view of American life	2000-11-04	2	1	1

"Many years ago, a famous columnist (Erma Bombeck or Ann Landers) said that if you could string up all your troubles on the back yard clothes line - and view all your neighbor's problems out there in the open - at the end of the day, you'd want to take back in your own problems. You wouldn't want to be in anyone else's shoes.I think that's a major theme in this movie. These families had deep, jarring, jugular issues. Yet they all managed - even worked to present a surface appearance of a normal, relatively happy American family.Underneath those smiley facades were dysfunction, frustration, regret, misery, etc.It's a movie about life in our modern times. Maybe that's why some are calling ""American Beauty"" a modern tragedy.A caveat - it is a dark story. Adultery, promiscuity, casual profanity - it's not a film for anyone under 18.  And the characters apparently have no morals or self-control.

The movie works for 3 reasons: Kevin Spacey, Annete Benning, and the cinematography. Kevin deserved the  Oscar well, and I'd give it to him just for the final look on his face, a  blank gaze of astonishment, horror, peace... and inevitablity. The film is  depressing in the end, yes, but it's in the way that it will make you  remember it forever, and it gives an important message. Even the first  words of the movie make you stand at attention (little do I know that in  less than a year, I'll be dead), as you see this man's upward (or downward,  for that matter) spiral. The scene that should definetly go down in history  is the wonderful dinner scene, where Lester tells his wife what he did that  day, what he thinks of her music, then, subtley stands up and smashes a  plate into the wall.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"Beauty"" begins with Lester Burnham (Spacey), so beaten down by lifeless routine, that he has lost even the ability to feel pain or anything.  Lester's harpy of a wife Carolyn (Benning), a status-hungry real-estate velociraptor is only capable of dishing out bile.  Between the two suffers Jane, their self-loathing daughter (Thora Birch from ""Ghost World).  We also meet those who surround them, a gay couple; a retired homophobic marine; his catatonic wife, their seemingly psychotic, voyeuristic and pot-selling son Ricky, and Jane's obviously psychotically vain friend Angela.Life though beautiful obviously isn't as nice as it looks.  Lester's cozy suburban home encloses his frigid wife and remote daughter, and for him it's a loveless shelter when he's not at work in his dead-end job.  Then something happens: On the verge of losing his job, Lester quits and blackmails his boss for a generous severance package. Now free, after a fashion, he entertains lustful thoughts of Angela while buying weed from Ricky, who unbeknownst to Lester, has become Jane's lover.  Freed from the daily grind, and with Ricky and Angela seeming to urge him on, Lester recreates himself as a teenager, directionless and determined at the same time. His approach to life disdains the carpediem that typified Hollywood ""Dead Poets"" rip-offs of the early 1990's for something more along ""let the day pass you by."" His wife, determined to succeed in real estate, is revealed not just amoral, but stunningly shallow - a walking manifestation of sheer materialism and ostentation. All who populate ""Beauty"" live in some illusion - Lester with his renewed youth, Carolyn and her dreams of success, Ricky and Sarah and their fantasies of a future together, Angela's fantasy of herself on the cover of ""Elle"", Ricky's father's mirage of the all-American family..etc. After meandering, the script decides that somebody will have to wake up and take reality on the chin for everybody else - and the script settles on Jane and Ricky.  Bad move: Jane and Ricky prove so mature in their love for each other, that they prove better able to wake up and smell the coffee than the rest of the cast.  Instead of a searing portrait of the disintegration of family life, Ricky and Jane prove that love and the family is alive and well.  The closer they get, the more we realize that Jane won't be destroyed by her self-loathing, and that Ricky's not really a psycho at all.  (If children are our future, then we could do far worse than Ricky and Jane.)  As Ricky and Jane straighten themselves out. The rest of the flick seems out of whack - as if the script suddenly became terrified of its capacity for mass destruction and wanted to turn into a sunny parody of its earlier self.  Jane contemplates life without bust enlargement; Carolyn's crass materialism, never disavowed, is mollified by her affair and possible love for her competitor in the real estate market (surprisingly refreshing Peter Gallagher); and Lester's attraction for Jane's friend is more mutual than irony should allow.  The only constant in this perfect storm is Ricky's father, a die-hard Marine whose only apparent role is to set the story firmly in America (apparently the only Western nation that British-born director Sam Mendes can conceive of teeming with right-wing, jingoistic, homophobic, militaristic robots).The script's sudden risk-shyness infects the characters so, that by the end of the film, all they can do is feel satisfied with each other. Even Lester, the most beaten down of them all, feels fine.I enjoyed the leads of this flick enough to overlook how otherwise overrated it really is. ""American Beauty"" never exploits its fictional setting to achieve any sharper edge on a now well-worn theme of the darkness underlying American family life. Surprisingly, it never explains the film's core plot point: Burnham's dramatic character shift (occurring in the film, but apparently late in life).  We get the idea that people have treated him like dirt for ages, yet in the first shot, he's already equipped to turn the tables on his boss and his wife, and attract Angela as well.What undermines the film the most is the persistent hint that those on the other side of the camera may be in thrall to the greatest illusion of all - that this really is a deep look at the shattered psyche of the American family that hasn't been done to death decades ago."	2.0	Study in American Misanthropy by Brit director	2005-07-21	28	16	12

Unlike some other reviewers here, I didn't find the characters stereotypical, with the exception of the repressed marine and his mousy (mentally ill?) wife - but the banality of their characters (beautifully acted, as were all the parts) serves to highlight the uniqueness of their son, Ricky, to me the most fascinating character in the film.Ricky brings out a good deal to like in Jane Burnham, with whom I had little sympathy prior to their relationship.  She seemed at first like merely another sullen, sulky teen, but Ricky is able to see something else in her - as he does with a piece of trash blowing in the wind, as he does with a pool of blood.  Ricky's gift for finding beauty in some of the most repellent parts of American culture (litter, violence, even teenage disaffectedness) is at the heart of AB's themes.Protagonist Lester takes the opposite tack, falling under the thrall of more obvious beauty in the person of Angela Hayes, only to find she's not the siren she seems, but an inexperienced young girl whom he finally treats with tenderness and respect.  I could go on and on, but the acting, the characterizations, the images of the roses, the use of reds, the parallels to &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (from the posthumous narration to the tragedy of a character living a lie, finally moved by that lie to commit murder) ... there's just so much to love about this movie.

The image is soft and not in a ""cinematographers choice"" kind of way but in a pixelated way. Paramount continues to release sub-par blu-rays until people complain, than release corrected versions (Gladiator being a perfect example). Worth getting? For a slightly better picture: yes. But no extra extras (a direct port of the DVD which means bonus material that is now nearly 10 years old) is a let down for their ""flagship"" Sapphire Collection.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A159CY9F6RT2N3	R. W. Holliston	American Beauty did very little for me the first time around. Its indictment of the &quot;American way of life&quot; has been done many times before, and often better. And I agree with another reviewer who suggested  that not every homophobe is a closet case (that's just the way the world  works). I was also put off by the extraordinary number of cliches in the  dialogue. But on second viewing, I realized that that's exactly how these  people would talk.  I appreciated it more the second time, although I still  feel it was overrated, and that Kevin Spacey should not have won the Oscar  over Russell Crowe's intense and multifarious performance in The Insider.  But my second viewing also reinforced my feeling that the two central  performances (and characters) are the weakest parts of the film. Spacey has  done this kind of oddball, world-weary character enough times already -  he's a great actor, and not uninteresting even just marking time, but  that's what he's doing here. Annette Bening is (I'm agreeing with another  reviewer here) unbearably shrill and one-note: she's capable of much better  (I'd love to have seen Bebe Neuwirth in this role). The young actors are  much better, as is the underrated Chris Cooper in a difficult role. Peter  Gallagher is wasted as an underdeveloped minor character. One thing that  annoyed me about this film is the way the director assumes we will  sympathize with Spacey's character over Bening's. She's often right: there  is nothing intrinsically admirable about impulsively quitting your job when  you have a family to look after; sex can be fun and spontaneous without  spilling beer all over the living room furniture; it is not unreasonable to  expect some gratitude from your husband and daughter when you come home  after a long day's work to cook them a &quot;nutritious yet savory&quot;  dinner. American Beauty opens with Lester wanking in the shower:  metaphorically, he wanks all the way through the film.  Because of the  complicated relationships between the younger characters, this is a must  see. Cooper's enactment of a deeply conflicted person is also worth  experiencing. The filming is expert. But American Beauty has a hole at its  center: the two leading characters don't work.  Good soundtrack, though....	4.0	I'm glad I saw this movie twice!	2000-07-24	4	3	1

When I say that it is beautiful, I am repetitive.  When I say that it is touching, I am trite.  But it is beautiful and touching, but it is also more.  It is true.  It is a true story of American life, of beauty, of family turmoil, of sadness, happiness, love, hate, searching, discovery, and more.  It isn't a true story in the traditional sense that, &quot;these things did happen.&quot;  It is true in the sense that these things DO happen, people DO feel this way, and people DO suffer, and love, and live, and die this way.  I can't really recommend this movie any more, but to say that it is real.	5.0	Brilliant.	2001-04-20	6	2	4
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2H8TJ0KP7WG7	Ryan Yale	"""American Beauty"" is a movie that doesn't completely go along with the normal Hollywood movie, in many ways it mocks it.  ""American Beauty"" exemplifies beauty in a range of different ways.  Towards the beginning of the movie Angela, the typical blond, good-looking, nice figured, sexual woman represents the typical view on ""beauty.""  Angela did everything to go with the ""norm"" of society.  She viewed herself as someone who was always being watched; therefore she always had to present herself as a ""model"" of sorts.  This touches bases with 20th century philosopher Foucault's notion of the Panopticon.  Pan meaning ""all"" and opticon meaning ""seeing.""  She feels as though if she isn't always looking as she ""should"" then she will develop a guilty conscious because she is in some ways letting down all the people who are constantly watching her.  Therefore performing to the panopticon notion.  This forces Angela to make herself out to be something she is not.  Throughout the movie she makes herself seem as though she is a very sexually active ""vixen"" because this is how she feels she has to be portrayed.  As the movie proceeds we find out that maybe all this has been a phasade and perhaps she isn't as she seems.""American Beauty"" also produces existing stereotypes and critiques them.  As stated an example of an existing stereotype is Angela, the good-looking blond women.  Jane, Angels ""friend,"" represents the part of the movie that critiques these existing stereotypes.  Jane, the rebellious teenager, realizes that she is not perfect based upon traditional society ""norms."" of how she should look.  She doesn't have the perfect body, she doesn't have the long blond hair, nor does she dress like Angela but she is happy enough with herself.  She doesn't care what her family, friends or society tell her to do to change her apperance.  A few times in the movie her mom, Carolyn, tell her that she looks depressed and that basically she doesn't look or act as she should.  In my opinion this is the movies way of critique the idea of typical societal ""norms.""  It's showing that you don't have to look a certain way in order to be beautiful.Ricky, Jane's next door neighbor, helps point out the difference between ""real"" beauty and ""ideal"" beauty.  Ricky is considered to be the odd outsider.  He is constantly filming everything he considers beautiful.  His main filming target always seems to be Jane even though she is not considered to represent ""ideal"" beauty.  This flusters Angela because she doesn't understand why Ricky is so interested in Jane and not in herself.  In one sequence of the film Ricky is taping from his house into Jane's room and Angela notices.  Angela immediately starts to pose in front of the window for Ricky, but Ricky doesn't pay any attention to her ""ideal"" beauty.  Instead Ricky focuses the camera to a target that represents more ""inter"" and ""real"" beauty, Jane who is looking into a mirror beyond Angela.  This shows us that the general stereotypes for beauty are not always what represent actual beauty.I really enjoyed this movie.  It really kept me thinking and not bored throughout it.  It also provides those twists and turns that you may not have seen coming.  This movie does a great job to both show and critique many stereotypes about beauty.  I highly recommend watching ""American Beauty."""	5.0	"""beauty"""	2004-05-11	4	4	0

Everyone will take with them a different perspective of it. I don't like to use the term 'life-affirming', but that's precisely what this  film is. The message is rammed home with the subtlety of a sledgehammer,  but I actually saw this film with someone who took some aspects of the film  too literally. The world of American Beauty is dark, miserable and pitiful.  Yet it's also honest in it's caustic social satire. This could be any  sleepy suburb of Americana.

The perfect american family on the outside but on teh inside is where the real beauty lies. When we think of beauty we all see the rose petals and the beautiful girl but this movie shows us the real beauty in everyday life. the way one event can change a man's life forever, a bag floating in the wind.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1K94LXX833JTT	Sanpete	"American Beauty is a complex film that moves in difficult territory with mixed results.  I admired and enjoyed many things about it, particularly the acting, cinematography and editing, along with some of the sharp humor.  However, there are some important parts that seem on reflection not to fit together or just not to work, and there is one key thread that's particularly ugly.Right at the start, Lester (Spacey) tells us he will soon be dead.  He appears to be a typical middle American in suburbia, with a wife and teenaged daughter, and the basic ingredients of the American Dream.  Under this surface is a seething anger and bitter unhappiness; the whole family is miserable.  Lester already feels dead inside.In the bottom of this mid-life trench Lester suddenly finds himself awakened to life, at least in his fantasies, by a roughly 16-year-old girl, his daughter's friend.  (There are references to Lolita throughout the film.)  This acts as a catalyst for a full retreat into an adolescent state of mind in which he feels reconnected and vital, more or less.  He quits his white-collar job, blackmails his former employer, gets a job at a burger joint, buys the 1970 Firebird he always wanted, and fantasizes about the high school girl.  When he finally arrives at the consummation of his fantasy, a shock brings him to a new state of mind.  There are also a couple subplots that come together at the end.The title and the generic suburban setting suggest that Lester and his family are representative of middle America, and Lester himself says he's just an ordinary guy.  If so, it's according to a very cynical view.  The film seems to be shaped, and deformed, by an overall cynicism, despite what appear to be genuine efforts to show compassion, moral development and even happiness.  There is an epilogue that seems sincere, beautiful and optimistic, but either it doesn't fit with the rest of the film or it too is cynical.The epilogue is beautifully presented, but dramatically it's curiously undermined, made ironic, commented on, or at least brought into question by cuts to the denouement of a bloody whodunit subplot.  The epilogue is also phrased in a self-negating way: ""gratitude"" and ""stupid little life"" are incongruously joined in one sentence.  Its sudden bliss, taken at face value, seems to negate the significance of the suffering shown through the rest of the film, as though some kind of nirvana has magically resulted.  And the final thought in the epilogue is hard to take seriously in the context of the film as a whole: that we'll all know exactly what the epilogue refers to someday (when we die).  Do the filmmakers really believe that?  Or is this part of the dark humor--the epilogue is no more real than the appearance of happiness for Lester's family was at the beginning?Or, as seems most likely to me, is the ending confused because the conflict between the cynicism and efforts at something better, and possibly the need for a more Hollywood ending, has mixed things up?The script actually began as a story about the real-life Amy Fisher, the ""Long Island Lolita"" who tried to kill her lover's wife.  The finished script was very different, but it was still framed by prison scenes and a murder trial.  After filming was complete the director changed that and other key points.  The DVD commentary by the director and the writer is remarkable for the way the director does almost all the talking.  At the end, the writer says he's found the director's comments very enlightening, that he never knew that was the director's intent, but that it all makes perfect sense.  It doesn't.No doubt some of the confusion of the film comes from the tortured process by which it went from one plot to a very different one, even at the last minute.  My hunch is that the director was trying to keep the film from being so negative that audiences would reject it.  He says he tried to keep Lester on the edge of what the audience could accept.  Reportedly, the script had him further over that edge.  It's no wonder the writer was so quiet about the end result.  The oddly presented and seemingly self-negating epilogue appears to sum up the competing forces that collided in the making of the film and were never quite harmonized.Despite the visual beauty of the film, it fails to be profound about beauty where it seems to try hardest.  A major theme is finding beauty in unexpected places, including death.  This isn't a profound truth as presented.  We seem to be asked to take seriously the idea that the dead have a special beauty akin to glimpsing God, but all we see in the main example, Lester himself dead, is the graphic quality of a ""still life"" (admired in the commentary as ""like a painting""), along with an awed reaction shot.  Any beauty in that is no different than that of a bowl of fruit, and is a very superficial way to view the death of a man.  Maybe it's the bliss of the epilogue that's supposed to be glimpsed in the dead but, again, the epilogue is hard to fit with the film overall, and even with itself.*Spoiler alert,* for this paragraph only.  (You might be able to guess some points from the following, though I won't actually say what they are, and you may still be surprised.)  To me, a particularly unpleasant aspect of the film has to do with the way Lester's relation with the the young object of his fantasies is presented.  Without giving anything away directly, what Lester does is treated as acceptable and harmless.  In the commentary, the director says Lester didn't abuse the girl, that he was gentle, that she could have said no, and that's the attitude reflected in the film.  She's about 16; Lester's over twice that.  No matter how experienced she could have been, how gentle he was, whether she said yes or no or nothing at all, and no matter how it all finally ended up, what Lester did was still inexcusable because of the vast difference in maturity and power.  It's a complex issue, but this kind of thing is far from harmless and seeing it treated as harmless in a graphic way, and excusing it for the reasons given, is ugly.  (The novel Lolita doesn't make the same mistake.)The film remains interesting not only despite its flaws but in part because of them.  The attempt to deal with its themes and bring them together in a satisfying way sharpens some questions even when it appears to fail.  Does Lester really become happy in his fantasies?  Are his fantasies beautiful or pathetic (there's a fair amount of evidence that the latter was intended, that the ""beauty"" was ironic).  What did Lester arrive at before he died (and why didn't the film develop that, cutting it off immediately)?  Is it possible to harmonize the things the film seems to try to bring together?"	4.0	Look closer ... at this film	2006-03-07	6	2	4

Things appear to be perfectly fine in the Burnham household: Lester and Carolyn are both gainfully employed, have a large, beautiful house in suburbia, drive luxury automobiles and their healthy, robust teenaged daughter is a cheerleader on the high school squad. Yet, every seasoned filmgoer knows to never trust appearances. Carolyn's career as a real estate agent isn't going well, so she's hoping that sleeping with the enormously successful real estate king will help rub off some of his fortune. Lester, on the other hand, doesn't have a career; he has a job. In fact, he has had the same job with the same employer for several years. The distinction between ""career"" and ""job"" is vitally important to those of us who merely have a ""job."" Sure, it might pay reasonably well, though not necessarily. A ""job,"" however, is not something we envision ourselves doing for the rest of our lives and it is certainly not how we define ourselves. In fact, we would rather not respond when asked what we do for a living. It simply does not matter to us. What is worse, Lester does not have a sense of identity. ""That's okay. I wouldn't remember me either,"" he responds when one of his wife's acquaintances mistakenly thinks they are meeting for the first time. Perhaps not many people can identify with this, though I certainly can. Lester and I are equally unremarkable, failing to make an impression on most people we meet. Maybe at one point in the past, or even still today deep down, we want to remain anonymous. It does have its advantages at times. It is often frustrating or embarrassing, however, and we realize this. Sometimes when people are indistinct, yet want to be noticed, they resort to drastic tactics. This is how murder sprees happen. But I digress. Rather than murder people, Lester nonetheless does take radical measures. With an unloving wife and a daughter who finds him an embarrassment, he chooses to quit everything in an effort to start over. In a quest to redefine himself, he returns to life the way it was before he was supposed to define himself. He was much more comfortable then. ""I want the job with the least amount of responsibility,"" he tells the teenaged manager of the fast food restaurant at which he applies for a job. Few responsibilities, not accountable to anyone and no one accountable to him; hanging out, lifting weights and smoking pot; this is life the way it was meant to be. Unfortunately for Lester, the young man (Wes Bentley) supplying him with weed happens to have an authoritarian, unenlightened father (Chris Cooper) with a particularly strong homophobic streak. Some misunderstandings occur and trouble ensues. While this film might not appeal to all tastes, judging from the high ratings and overwhelmingly positive reviews that many people see much of themselves in the characters portrayed in this film. I know this is the case for me."	5.0	One of my favorite films	2006-09-20	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A14PB4JA6LW7G0	Sarah E. Golding	Life.  That is what this movie is all about.  It is about who we are, what we project ourselves as, and most importantly what we deny ourselves in order to appear a certain way to the outside world.  This is a great movie.  Its plot twist and turns.  Its characters change and grow before our eyes.  Its filming and direction  by Sam Mendes is smart, witty, and beautiful.  This film is worth seeing once, and then worth seeing again.This film and its characters will remind you of both people you know and yourself.  This story is about a &quot;typical&quot; American family.  Lester Burnham (played by Academy Award winning Kevin Spacey) and his wife Carolyn Burnham (played by Academy Award Nominee Annette Bening) are a so-called happily married couple.  They live with their daughter in a nice house in American suburbia.  Their lives are all normal...and then it all changes for them.  I can't say much more because one of this movies best features is it twists in the plot and how each character changes throughout the movie.I must warn everyone thought that some of the issues this movie deals with aren't for the timid.  Also, this movie deals with both images and topics that aren't really appropriate for the younger viewing audience.  This is an adult movie--and a very good one at that.  Both Spacey and Bening's preformances are wonderful.  Spacey makes you feel what his character is all about.  Bening's preformance as Carolyn is sometimes overstated and maybe a little overacted.  The other charcters in the movie also do a fantastic job with their parts.	5.0	A movie that makes you think	2000-10-21	1	1	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2ELEHUVVJ3GUL	Sarah Taylor	"American Beauty, a film directed by Sam Mendes, is meant primarily as a commentary on the American ideal of lifestyle and it's vast difference concerning reality. The film's previews include the cath phrase ""Look Closer,"" which prompts the audience to examine the film. The movie opens with a scene of the ""ideal"" suburban neighborhood, which is anything but that. On this street lives a gay couple, a couple in which the father is militaristic and the mother is suppressed to the point which she loses contact with the world, and the Burnham family. Outwardly, the Burnham family is living the American dream, big house, good jobs, and even a white picket fence. However, if one does ""look closer"" one would see that this is simply a facade perpetuated by Caroline, the Burnham wife/mother. She is perfectly groomed, has a (somewhat) successful career, cooks wholesome meals, and listens to elevator music at dinnertime. Through interesting plot development, Mendes destroys the stereotype and eventually Caroline.Lester, the husband/father, is submissive to this scenario until his job is threatened and he snaps. Lester quits, obtains a job at a fast-food restaurant, begins to work out, begins an affair with his daughter's cheerleader-friend, and picks up smoking pot, and he's never felt better. Gone is our ideal father, replaced with a rebel rediscovering his youth.Jane, the daughter, is out of touch with her parents. She is somewhat of a nonconformist and her contact with her mother destroys our notion of ideal mother-daughter relations. Caroline only speaks to Jane to acknowledge how proud she is that Jane hasn't ""messed up"" and to criticize Jane's choice of clothing. Jane is unsure of herself and very self conscious, she is not the happy-go-lucky teen of our dreams.Also on this street lives Ricky, who views the world through his camera lens. He films what he considers beauty and serves as a representative of panopticon, or the view that we are always being watched. Through his lens Ricky films Jane, who eventually becomes romantically attached to Ricky and strips for the camera. Jane becomes the subject of Rickys's interest which although first is uninvited, soon becomes welcome. Ricky uses his camera to survey his domain, the new neighborhood, and to watch Jane. It is he who ""looks closer,"" not only at the stereotypes but at the world itself, and finds beauty in it.American Beauty not only helps us realize the futility of pursuing an ""American dream"" but also invites us to look closer at our own lives and to find the beauty within them."	5.0	American Beauty: Look Closer	2004-05-11	3	3	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A37O59DLEGDNTQ	SardonicCynic	This is one of the truly rare films that works brilliantly on every possible level. As a satire, it delves deep into the heart of society, and illuminates the strong undertones of resentment, despair and desire that  flourish beneath glossy facade of American life. It displays the reasons  why so many lives unfold without any happiness, because people choose to  live without going after their dreams and ambitions. On the other side  &quot;American Beauty&quot; is also a modern tragedy, a story of one man's  search for identity and freedom, and the way he profoundly impacts the  people around him. The film slowly unravels the masks people where, and  explores the moral obscurity and emotional chaos they could plunge into  when they decide of follow their heart instead of their conscience. Kevin  Spacey is phenomenal as Lester Burnham, his performance is 100% worthy of  an Oscar. Alan Ball's script never ceases to amaze me, it's abundance of  shrewd observations and insights is something to marvel at. Visually, the  film is stunning, it's imagery is nothing short of cinematic poetry, you  will find yourself in awe in every frame, every moment. &quot;American  Beauty&quot; never shies away from reality, no matter how sad, and in the  end, you will find yourself looking at the things that surround you with a  whole new outlook.

I've gone through and read the reviews for this movie, and about 2 per page are negative (as opposed to the other 8 5-stars per page).  For those of you who wrote all of those comments, let me be the first to tell  you something.  American Beauty did a pretty weak job of portraying  American suburbia.  The REAL America is 10times as x-rated as the directors  showed it to be.  To be more precise, I doubt they could have gotten the  real America into theatres (not including the ones that show nothing but  cheap porn at midnight).  Suffering from the same plight as American Pie,  they had to tone it down a bit.  I've had gay neighbors. (didn't like  them.. but they were there, and they didn't jog, but they rode bikes every  afternoon).  I think everyone in the world knows someone who's unhappy with  their marriage now-a-days.  Aside from the disasterous ending, and Lester's  &quot;awakening&quot; (which was meant to be different anyway) I can't  think of one part of this movie that ISN'T part of American life.The  adult roles were convincing, and cynically humorous, but the  &quot;children&quot; acting was the most amazing.Keep that in mind  when you read the other reviews.	3.0	What can I say...	2000-06-27	6	2	4

I tried to see the genius that  was described in rave reviews and by everyone who had seen it, but all I  saw was a long string of cliches in a film that was far too long itself.  American Beauty was hailed as showing the truly shocking side of American  suburbia.  But there was nothing true or shocking about the portrayal of  family life in the movie.  Every character is extremely cartoonish, and  it's difficult to care about any of them.  Though I was supposed find  Lester Burnam appealing for his frustrations with middle-age life, his  character was self-centered and very irritating.  Luckily he wasn't as  irritating as Annette Benning's character, whose shrill voice and  cartoonish personality made for a highly overrated performance.  It's  disappointing that an actress of such talent was given such a  one-dimensional role.  The film deals with issues that are old and  overused, and it says nothing original on these issues.  With this film,  there is one word that sums everything up: overrated!	2.0	Simply hype	2000-08-05	16	6	10

I am a big fan of Kevin Spacey and that is what originally drew me to the film. I have never been so educated or touched by a film before. The acting was sublime and I sincerely believe that it might have been perfect. It is the best film of all time.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A264XZUXLFMZ8B	Seth Webber	The first time I saw this film I was at a very difficult time in my life, but this film helped me look at the world in a completely different manner.  Of course there are several different themes woven into the story, the one that stood out to me was the idea of beauty in the world.  This film taught me that I shouldn't focus all my attention into just one thing because there is so much beauty in the world that to lock onto just one thing means you block everything else out.  This frame of mind allows you to live life to the fullest by not missing out on the glorious world that surrounds us.  From the moment the film ended the first time, I was in love with the script, cinematography, direction, and acting.  However, it wasn't until I bought American Beauty on DVD did I realize how much of an artist Sam Mendes really is.  Through his commentary and storyboard review with cinematographer Conrad Hall you begin to understand the technique he took in handling this story.  I'm looking forward to his next project, whatever it will be.	5.0	My favorite film of all time	2001-03-14	2	0	2

I now plan on buying it once the rental sale  price drops to about twenty bucks or so.I wasn't expecting much from  this movie.  I couldn't believe how pleased I was with it once I watched  it.  It's basically about two families.  One militant and one a little  unusual.  A young gentleman who moves in next door becomes infactuated with  his female next door neighbor.  He films her constantly admiring her beauty  along with his deep desire for her.  Her father is bored with her  relationship with his wife and finds added energy to fulfill his life when  he sees a young beauty at a basketball game cheerleading with his young  daughter.  He starts his quest to regain his youth through conversations  overheard between his daughter and her friend.  He becomes friends with the  young male neighbor out behind a party one night while sharing a joint.  The neighbors father believes his son is having sexual relationships with  his male neighbor and resents his son for it.  I really don't want to give  any more of the story away.  All I can say is you should definately pick  this video up at your local rental until the price drops and you can afford  to buy it.I will say this movie is not for younger audiences.  There is  nudity and strong language as well as adult themes in this film.  Otherwise  pick it up for yourself and enjoy a great film that actually did deserve an  oscar.	5.0	A must see	2000-05-29	0	0	0

Snyder	There are so many reviews already, so I'll skip the plot synopsis, since that is not really the most crucial element in this film.  American Beauty was simply astounding in its vivid portrayal of clandestine lives hidden behind locked doors, the hidden loveliness in the world and its subjectivity, and the importance of happiness, no matter how insignificantly caused in people's lives.The performances were great, especially Kevin Spacey, a great actor who truly deserved his Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Lester Burnham.  Spacey was very charismatic and immensely likeable as the everyman, and it was very easy to sympathize with his feelings.  Annette Bening was absolutely frightening as his control-freak wife Carolyn, and the other supporting actors excelled as well.Highly recommended viewing.  One of the few movies in recent years that I would consider to be great.	5.0	Simply Beautiful	2001-04-07	4	2	2

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AI07RV3RE6K8L	Sharon Chae	My absolute favorite film of 1999 and one of the best ever.  Unlike many of the more &quot;profound&quot; films out there, this movie does not condescend to you with obscure, &quot;too-cool-for-thou&quot; plots or  epithets.  Instead, the relatable, ironic, and funny plot unfolds with the  flawless performances of Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, and most notably (in  my opinion) a white-hot newcomer Wes Bentley who gives a mind-blowing  performance as the &quot;hero&quot; of Kevin Spacey.  This movie says  everything you have ever thought about but never ventured to say aloud,  eloquently and beautifully.  I recommend it wholeheartedly and would be  disagreeably surprised if any other film won the Oscar for Best Picture.	5.0	Tour de Force	2000-02-15	3	2	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	On the surface, this stunner from Sam Mendes is such a relentlessly bleak look at the vacuity of the supposed &quot;American Dream&quot; that viewers may just turn off to it en masse. And it shows in the acute polarization of reviews here on Amazon.But if you can be a little less knee-jerk and not shut off all rational thought when confronted with what's disturbingly familiar, you may also find that the film is genuinely, voraciously amusing, and directed with such breathtaking flair that Spacey's bravura performance seems like a career-defining one.Beneath the surface of all the seeming pettiness in our daily  idiosynchrasies, the theme points out, is an entire world of such simple elegance that chortles to be seen and heard, but is neither recognized nor heeded to.An interesting visual device in the film is the use of windows. Not just a use, but a splurge, come to think of it. Almost everything important happens in front of, around, or through windows. Could this be a metaphor perhaps for self-examination, for viewing one's life from the outside?What I do not understand is why most films in this genre (Ice Storm, Ordinary People) end with a dramatically tragic finale. Does it take a shattering turn of events to break everyone out of their daily reverie? Something to think about.Any rate, long story short: an evocative gem you need to own.	5.0	AN EXQUISITE AFFIRMATION OF LIFE	2004-07-16	8	6	2

"Writer, Alan Ball's (of Six Feet Under fame) first theatrical script blurs those stereotypical slow death in suburbia lines and keeps the viewer off balance throughout the entirety of the film.This film, is, above all, a deeply moving drama. The suburbanite, highly dysfunctional, Burnham Family is sad, enchanting, sickening, wonderful, confusing, tragic, abhorrent, and every other adjective listed in Websters.  That is precisely what makes this film a true ""one-of-a-kind"".Mr. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey)is daily pitted against his icy, cheating, manic, depressed, totally materialistic realtor of a psudo-wife, Carolyn (Annette Beining) and his quite sullen, self-absorbed, ambivolent, teenaged daughter, Jane (Thora Birch).However, into Lester & Jane's lives come two very achingly beautiful & wonderful human beings. Jane's fellow cheerleader confidant Angela Hayes-note the Nabokov/Lolita reference in the last name-(Mena Suvari) who has a penchant for older men and a huge crush on Jane's daddy, jolts Lester into a sexual epiphany that makes Lester's life worth living again. He daily fantasizes about the young, sexy Angela. She makes him feel like a bumbling, pimplefaced teenager on his first date and all of these meetings between the two really blooms into kind of a second adolescence for the harried Lester. An eerily calm, young next door neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) and his lifelong Marine Corps father, Col. Frank Fitts, USMC (Chris Cooper) add much drama.The whole cast turns out top-notch performances and the score, cinematography & direction are utterly ""dreamlike"".Highly recommended!Happy Watching!"	5.0	The Best Film I Have Seen In Over 5 Years!	2004-05-06	4	4	0

The characters are so real in this movie... you totally forget that there  is any acting going on. Real people with real hang-ups, you see them warts  and all.Middle-aged angst, teen angst, voyeurism, infidelity, jealousy,  apathy, homophobia, murder, patricide, blackmail, drug use... I'm not sure  if there is a problem in modern society that isn't in this film. It was an  incredibly crafted piece of work, however, to get so many stories within  stories, so many topics and have them all work in a film of less than 2  hours.Every actor from the most insignificant extra all the way to  Spacey and Bening did an outstanding performance. There was no scene that  seemed artificial or staged... everything seemed like reality, as you could  picture it happening. The film is sometimes a comedy, but also a tragedy...  but not just a dark movie w/ a few light moments. Like life, the light and  dark are intertwined into a feast of emotions, sights and sounds.  The film  underscores the fact that life is often stranger than fiction... and while  all of these crazy stories and people intertwine, everyone else's life  always seems more convoluted, bizarre and complicated than our own when  taken out of context.The R rating is not a joke... this is NOT a film  for kids. There is nudity, sexual inuendo, drug use, violence and probably  more that I'm not remembering right now, but that should be enough... this  is a film for grownups - period.	5.0	beautifully filmed and executed	2000-07-14	38	25	13

Starting off with the hubby masturbating in the shower (yes, just the facts,no embellishments). Some pleasant shots of California suburbs. So what, I can see some trendy suburbs here in Pa., or anywhere else for that matter. Every character is completely useless, except the long suffering daughter, whose father (who does his thing in the shower,this demonstrates his dead end,loveless marriage with an even more shallow money/real estate obsessed wife) is a true smarmy, lying wimp, not above smoking dope with his deranged (but pleasant) teenage neighbor,who turns into a friend of the wimp's long-suffering daughter.And to top it off this frustrated 40 year old suburban white,married (very unhappily) male,with one daughter has an ogling obsession for the Lolita-like cheerleader,foul mouthed friend of said long suffering daughter! There are plenty more generally nasty stereotypes, including the big shot real estate man with whom the said cipher of a wife goes gaga, resulting in the standard voyeuristic hard to watch bedroom scene which is supposed to be funny. And we're supposed to think that blackmailing your pain in the rear boss is funny too! And the strange boy's dad who thinks the aforementioned man, he who does smoke pot with son (not known by son's father) is actually what was once referred to as ""queer"", and may be directing his son in this direction..More misleading,voyeurism which some may find sickening. One or two of the real estate scenes may be funny,even if they're older and more dated than MR BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE from about 50 years ago...The last 15 minutes all of a sudden become a decent thriller too, if you make it this far. And there is a twist at the very end, but this viewer was not surprised in the least...The moral seems to be ""Why don't we just treat everyone with love and kindness,and think about the important things?"" Nice moral,but a very ugly way to say it!! However, this film is timeless in that it is a classic case of a very ugly popular culture at the turn of the millenium! After watching this Academy Award Winner (Best Picture !!), I decided I would pass on the standard self-congratulatory ""Making of this Film"" nonsense.PS...Could anyone ever imagine leading actors (leading men)of yesteryear playing a role here like Spacey's,starting with the shower scene? Imagine Clark Gable, Jimmy Stewart, Cagney, Bogart,H. Fonda, John Wayne,Cary Grant, Burt Lancaster, William Holden, the Marx Bros(!)Jack Lemmon,the Three Stooges(!),Ronald Reagon,Sinatra,Orson Welles, anyone...I Don't think so.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A27M0CNORWZLG1	Sheppdawg	There are movies and there are films. Today, I will focus on one of the few movies I regard as a true cinematic masterpiece: the film American Beauty.When I was a teenager I had this dream of becoming a movie director. I saw all the popular movies. I watched movies that generally were entertaining and fun. But I knew if I wanted to cut it as a true director I would have to expand my horizons. So I decided to start watching movies that had won Oscars.Enter American Beauty. I watched the Academy Awards in 2000 and saw that film win five of them, including the top ones like Best Picture and Best Actor. I knew I had to see it.But there was a small dilemma: I was fifteen. My parents were very strict about allowing me to view &#34;R&#34; rated movies. After much begging and pleading, my parents granted me permission. My Dad and I went to see American Beauty at the one theater in town that was showing it. Nothing could've prepared me for that day.As I sat in the back row of one of the smaller theater screens, the story began to take shape. Keep in mind that I was only fifteen but while watching this I could feel Lester Burnham's intense self-loathing of what his life had become. He yearned to gain his youth back and become carefree once again. Upon seeing his daughter's friend, Angela, something deep inside him is awoken. He rediscovers something inside of him that doesn't take life too seriously; that doesn't care about the material things; something that can't be defined yet is still in all of us if we truly search for it.He quits his job and blackmails his boss. He buys his childhood dream car. He hits on his daughter's friend. He starts smoking pot. He starts working out. He even gets a job as a fast food burger flipper. Depending on the way you look at it some might construe that as pathetic. In a way it kind of is. But he gains something more important than anything else: true happiness.It's hard to imagine a character such as Lester Burnham becoming anything better or growing as a person. It appears as though he has regressed, not progressed. But by regressing he is progressing, if that makes any sense. I know it sounds paradoxical but that's how he's able to grow in this film.When the film ended and the credits came up, I sat in that theater, in total shock, and watched them. It was the best film I'd ever seen and, to this day, have ever seen.The other supporting characters are just as interesting and make for a great cast. The interaction between Lester and everyone else is both dramatic and comical at times. While everyone has a different interpretation of this film, I think everyone can agree that it has all the elements of a great movie and although it does end in tragedy, it is still a very powerful film that has been my all-time favorite movie since I've viewed it on that Spring day in the year 2000. Although I didn't make it as a movie director (at least not yet), this movie inspired me to do what I always have known is my true passion: filmmaking.This is one you definately have to see. I can't recommend it enough. Look closer...	5.0	FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME...	2012-12-13	5	1	4
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2U0CNW2AKK8AT	"""shinhandsomemichael"""	First of all, American Beauty is the best film of 1999. Secondly, Mr. Sam Mendes as its director was so talented in THAT he knew WHAT he wanted the film to come out to be:its directions, its feels and ambience , et al, and  also successfully got the best out of those characters in the film via  sublime performance rendered by the whole bunch of brilliant cast  collectively.The whole story of American Beauty was told from what the  spirit of the dead Lester Burnham ( Kevin Spacey ) had seen through the  last year of his life.In a peaceful suburban neighborhoood where his  house was located in, it all began with the depressed feelings for his  middle-life crisis; the day-by-day gradual distance kept to each other by  him and his once-so-lovely-and-shiny wife, Carolyn Burnham ( Annette Bening  ), whose life-long ambition was to be the most successful and respectable  residential realtor who was willing to sacrifice EVERYTHING in life just to  get there; their ungrateful teen daughter who always blamed on her parents  for ruining her life; his own going-nowhere publication job.....Not only  everyone in his house was revolving around his self but also the other two  households nearby: the gay couple and the retired US marine Colonel Frank  Fitts and his family.Every character in this film more or less  successfully manipulated others' perceptions towards him or her and in  return his or her own perception was successfully manipulated, which the  film was intended to show how powerful and dangerous SUBJECTIVE perception  could negatively affect one' s life.For instance, the image of Angela  Hayes as a chic, fly girl who hated to be perceived as an ordinary, boring  one; Carolyn Burnham who always felt the need to project the image of  success ( Personally, as a former realtor, I really felt for her as if I  were in her shoes in the film ) despite the fact that she was so miserable;  Ricky Fitts who' d successfully convinced his pop that he could afford all  of his latest hi-tech audio-visual systems in his room with his  table-waiting job - Memorable quote: Never underestimate the Power of  Denial....; et al.The film also wisely played with psychological defense  mechanisms like displacement, regression, rationalization, etc.Wrapping  it up, the drama-comedy American Beauty realisticly projects and deals with  the elements of middle-life crisis, hidden depression, black-mailing,  subjective perceptions, shattered dreams and finally the flashback of  Lester's best years of his life just in time of his departure.About the  cast: Kevin Spacey, once again, delivered another of his sublime  performance as usual; Annette Bening, in my humble opinion, deserves an  Oscar-winning tie with Miss Swank of Boys Don' t Cry; Something about the  way Wes Bentley looked in this film for 100 % convinced us that he was not  acting as Ricky Fitts, rather he WAS Ricky Fitts- Too bad that '99 nominee  list of Actor in Supporting Role's traffic are so jammed with great actors  with their deserved nomination; Wittiest screenplay with masterful plot  twistS and heavenly cinematography, to name a few.American Beauty is  definitely a film that is and will always be a part of viewers' sweet  memories and entertaining experience.Shin P.	5.0	( Look Closer at ) THE RARE BEAUTY	2000-05-01	46	33	13
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2RL9JHYNEJ1QR	"SH in Tampa ""SPH"""	In brief, American Beauty is the tale of families that are in transition as each member seeks to leave his/her unfufilling present and move to a brighter future.I am sure that a movie this complex will having different meanings to many people.  Each individual character is well developed and interesting.My personal favourite character is Lester, the father of a rebellious teen age daughter and husband to an aggressive, domineering wife.  Lester has successfully pursued his career, built a house and a family and is looking back of the joys of his youth, wistfully wishing for a second shot.  This is not a new character archetype, however, it has been modernized.  The conflicts that Lester experiences are very in tune with those that my peers in their 30-40s experience:  competing with his wife for success, empathizing more with his neighbours drug dealing son than with the neighbours 1950s morality and being overwhelmed by the blantant sexuality of today's teens.I am sure that other viewers could easily identify with characters other than Lester, he just happens to be my favourite.As a DVD purchase, it is an ok bet.  The sound quality is good but not overwhelming and the same can be said for the video.  For a movie this complex, I found the director's commentary interesting and the best reason to buy the DVD.  The making of featurette is just a 20 min commercial for a film that you have already seen and I have never understood why the theatrical trailers are included.	4.0	Resonates with the deflated male	2000-11-22	4	3	1

I know that this is supposed to be a &quot;dark&quot; comedy, but I totally found it to be disturbing and I disliked all of the characters.  Kevin Spacey's acting is great, but his character totally going for his daughter's girlfriend made me sick.  I am trying to understand that it can be a fantasy for this middle-aged, exhausted man to lust after a high school girl, but that is called rape usually.  I think that in showing all the dysfunction in family life it is a sad commentary instead of something to be revered or laughed at.Don't waste your time with this movie.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ATEHXYF5V67KZ	Simon Starchevsky	- That would also have been an appropriate title for this brilliant film. From the very beginning the viewer is given the outcome, but the journey is so consuming that we forget.The movie's plot draws out the life of Lester as an unhappy and perhaps incompetent father who is depressed by his wife's lack of affection and a job that is eating away at his life - all the synopsis of his mid-life crisis.I won't give away the movie, because I hate it when people do the same to me. But the dream sequences, the revelation of American suburbia's lies and pretenses that we accept every day, the sheer power of a person who actually lives his life, and the forgotten concept of what is happiness - all carefully crafted and tied together makes this DVD a masterpiece.	5.0	The American Masquerade	2003-03-20	4	3	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2CNLKJ6U3IE6C	sirwinston@erols.com	I cannot express how great a masterpiece this film was.  It's at once uplifting and emotional, visceral even, while still being a great film with great cinematography and a great script.  I once took a film course at a  prominent liberal arts college, and *American Beauty* is easily the equal  of any of the 25 classics we explored.Now that I've used the word  &quot;great&quot; so profusely, let me tell you why.  The script and its  character-driven subplots aren't stereotypical, as some have demurred;  rather, the characters are believable archetypes, true to real-world people  most of us have known.  We can see truths in Kevin Spacey's portrayal of a  man romanticizing his youth and lusting after its symbol, Mena Suvari as  the cheerleader who looks like a 16-year-old wearing too much make-up in  the belief that it makes her appear more mature; we can see truths in  Ricky's lust for life and attempts to &quot;capture&quot; its essence--it's  beautiful how Ricky, the quintessential outcast &quot;crazy&quot; and  &quot;loser,&quot; is through his understanding of death the only person in  the film who understands the meaning and beauty in life.  Reminds me of the  poet Wallace Stevens' writings, in which &quot;Death is the mother of  beauty&quot;--i.e., the transitoriness and ephemeral nature of everything  is what gives it beauty.Ultimately, this film has a powerful  philosophical voice speaking in harmony with delicious imagery of the  beautiful--from Mena Suvari's supple bare adolescent breasts to the  changing seasons you see in the trees, from rosepetals and flesh to the  not-so-obvious beauty of a dead bird.  The most striking image is perhaps  the confining suburban sameness of hundreds of identical houses and streets  in a grid which we see at the start of the film--but most striking is that,  as the camera pans out over that same suburban sameness at the end of the  journey, it kind of looks beautiful, no longer oppressive, and peaceful.  Only a truly powerful film could subvert that image so completely.The  acting performances were also incredibly strong, which is important because  above all this film isn't about imagery as much as it's about people and  their relationships.  There's almost a pantheistic feeling to the film, in  that happiness is found only by communing with the world around you, and  loving your fellow man.  I am the type of person who lets a few tears slip  when I see or read something truly moving, which is seldom; certain parts  of the Bible and the Tao te Ching bring a tear to the eye; Alanis  Morissette as a joyful God who childishly plays in the grass in *Dogma*  brings a tear to the eye; but three times, at the bag-dancing climax in the  middle, at the sight of Mena Suvari almost in tears by the moonlight, and  at the surprise anti-climax at the end, three times did this film affect me  that much.To sum up, if this film doesn't affect you, you probably don't  understand its subtexts and its truths.  If it doesn't, please watch it  again and try to understand what it's like to be in these positions--which  are very common ones--and to see the beauty of the imagery here and the  philosophy depicted.  It's rather like *Eyes Wide Shut* in that you either  *understand* the film viscerally, or you just can't see its truths; but  *Eyes Wide Shut* is about things most people won't understand unless  they're middle-aged men, while *American Beauty* is more universal in its  scope.	5.0	This film will be on the American Film Institute's Top 100..	2000-02-29	24	18	6

Okay maybe Kevin Spacey is looking pretty young, aside that it did not feel dated one bit. Annette Bening was amazing in this film, she captured how typical &#34;Type A&#34; personalities of that era were so self absorbed and cared more about image than substance.  The scene were she failed to sell a house during an open house, slapping herself several times as to punish herself was so powerful and unexpected makes you wonder what really goes on behind closed doors when high strung sales people fail. At every corner was an unexpected turn, you couldn't help but to love Kevin's character, you found yourself rutting for him through out the movie, although he was participating in events you may not agree with or otherwise finding yourself not wanting to participate watching a movie of characters with such flaws, but you can't help yourself. Expect the unexpected. Enjoy the ride. Never a dull moment.P.S. I watched this movie with my 17 year old son, who thought it was over the top.

It is the best and most original film of the 90's, and 1 of the 10 best movies of all time. It reminds us of the personal things that we find beautiful.  And it tells us to push beyond the surface of things so we might find that which we did not see before.  Its a film filled with powerful performances and heartbreaking tradgety.  Some people may not understand this type of movie.  But those people are blind anyway, and probably are obsessed with action movies.  And lets face it those are the worst people.

This can't really be what movie viewers want to see?  The dark side of every-day American life?  Are we all that shallow and self-absored that we crave more salt for our poor pathetic wounds?  What is so original about the theme of this story and do we really need to see more of the ordinary, desperate, pointless, droll complaining of a regular, everyday American life?This movie offers Lester's point of view of his life, a pompus bemoaning of a man in mid-life crisis, his marriage to an infidel-woman who has no original thoughts which he has grown apart from, his daughter who is too self-absored to care about her parents and instead is interested in the boy-next-door who happens to be (surprise) yet another drug dealer, and of course the boys militant, homophobic father and brain-dead, lackluster mother, and last but not least--the beautiful friend of Lester's daughter which gives Lester the usual, routine fantasies and takes us back to poor Lester's story.  'Round and 'round we go.All sounds familiar, doesn't it?  Movie producers must think we don't get enough of it in our own lives!  They are certain that although we live it everyday, we want to pay to see more!  Been there, seen it, done it. Moving on.  We can all say that, can't we?

Come on!I challenge you to try to image what other cultures think when they view this movie...look at those righteous Americans, who have so much prosperity, blessings, and everyday comforts, becrying another banal tale of sad, woe-is-me American lives!  If you believe this movie deserves the awards it received, then you really DON'T ""get"" it!How ridiculous we are to create one story after another, constantly crying about our truthfully small problems, and then to create so much praise and bravado for them!  Wouldn't it be so much more ""taking-the-high-road"" to care about something else besides our selfish selves?  OK, there are tons of movies out there, both great ones and garbage.  But watch out for the ones that win for political reasons and not truly for the pure quality of the movie.Yes, Look Closer!  There are hundreds of quality movies worth viewing with thoughtful messages worthy of great praise and a closer look!  We are surrounded by a whole world which knows true desperation and genuine suffering.

Langland	American Beauty wants to be subversive, so it throws in &quot;dark&quot; themes such as sexual obsession,  and closeted homosexuality. But the subject matter, middle-aged malaise in suburbia (specifically white/breeder  suburbia) is old hat , and was better explored in Ang Lee's exquisite  &quot;The Ice Storm.&quot; We  are in cliche land here, so enduring,  satisfying love between a married middle-aged man and career minded woman  is  unthinkable: needless to say, the only hope for the future lies in the  love between teenagers: the couple's daughter, and the drug dealing  neighbor boy (but with savings of 40 grand he IS a successful business  man!) played by  Wes Bentley, &amp; Thora Birch. Kevin Spacy is always  watchable, and does a nice, work-man like job here. Annette Benning plays  the uptight, career driven ball-busting wife on one note: shrill. Her's was  undoubtedly the most  overrated performance in '99. Chris Cooper does a  nice job as the proverbial villain: ex-military, homo  hating, wife-child  abusing, neo-nazi closet case (whew, Alan Ball managed to get in every last  cliche  with this cardboard character: Hey Alan, ever consider that  homophobes are simply hateful, and not  secretly gay?) I can see why this  movie seemed so great given the mindless drivel that Hollywood routinely  spews  forth, and yet, when realizes that the theme of this movie is  basically a long rant against heterosexual  suburban life, the content  becomes so predictable! Are surburban famlies dysfunctional? You betcha!  Have  we, as a society come up with a better system? Not yet.	3.0	Overrated, but well done	2000-07-02	17	7	10

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3SAU1A0IEYDNX	Soaring Heart	&quot;I NEED TO REMEMBER.&quot; [Wes Bentley]  We all need to remember this movie.AMERICAN BEAUTY--the brilliant title, script, and direction; the amazing cinematography and sound effects; the dazzling visual effects,  and enthralling music; plus the incredible acting of  Kevin Spacey, Wes  Bentley, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari, Annette Bening and Allison  Janney all work together to make this film deservingly win BEST PICTURE.How this film successfully accomplishes that there is indeed &quot;so  much beauty in the world&quot; is puzzling considering the plot; what a  paradox.This movie is truly a work of art.  Every American should own  AMERICAN BEAUTY. This and one other movie I've seen are so brilliant that I  would actually buy the script; it definitely should be made into a  book.Don't take me as a viewer that sees this as the most flawless movie  ever made; because I don't. After taking over 10 pages of notes I found  areas that didn't make sense.  One of the most unrealistic components is  Jane being a cheerleader; she is not the type. So naturally that would  affirm that her friendship with the superficial, self-absorbed Angela would  never have happened. [Come on, we've all been to high school; we know  things just don't work that way.]  Secondly, the &quot;King&quot; of  real-estate having an affair with a competitor in the middle of a highly  publicized divorce in a cheap hotel room also doesn't fit. Thirdly, Ricky's  Dad finding the one brief moment of tape of Lester lifting weights when  Ricky has been filming Jane 90% of the time was extremely unrealistic.  Fourthly, Ricky's Dad confronting Lester in such a manner was totally out  of his military character; nevertheless it was a very effective intense  scene.So then why do you give it 5 stars if you see so many flaws, you  ask?  Because even with the flaws AMERICAN BEAUTY is mesmerizing and  definitely Beautiful. The Beauty supersedes the tiny flaws that I found and  really made me think. The movies that make the viewer think--truly think,  are usually the best movies. Because of this and countless more reasons, I  will buy a copy and keep it in my video collection forever.As Kevin  Spacey, who so deservingly won Best Actor  says at the end: [we the  viewers] &quot;have no idea what I am talking about I'm sure.  But don't  worry, you will someday.&quot;This movie is one of the best you will  ever see. &quot;SPECTACULAR!&quot;	5.0	&quot;VIDEO IS A POOR EXCUSE I KNOW BUT IT HELPS ME REMEMBER...&quot;	2000-06-28	13	8	5
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A27ZPBY2NSTD63	"SockPuppetTheatre ""hammerscholar"""	This is suburban life? How many books do you see in the Burnham household? The mother and the father have absolutely no interest in anything outside their jobs, i can hear people saying 'well isn't that what suburban life is like?' no, it isn't, oh well, Hollywood has misrepresented every other group in society over the years i guess we can't expect them to do any better with the middle classes. The only moment where Spacey's character touches reality is when he bemoans having to miss the James Bond marathon on tv because of his daughter's cheerleading. Come on, the mother listens to South Pacific at the dinner table, we're off in Hollywood lala land...The screenplay is one of the laziest most hackneyed pieces of writing i've ever come across, veering between shallow and predictable teen soap opera and something akin to american pie. The 'at least i'm not ugly' 'yes you are, you're ugly on the inside' moment is as cheap as they come, it even brought a celebratory roar out of the audience and a few springeresque whoops. Also, the screaming of ridiculous things at the point of orgasm is as tired a joke as they come, it got the biggest laugh in the cinema. And of course the [friend] is really a virgin, and when he finds out Lester Burnham decides not to do her right there on the sofa.The film could prbably get away with it if it did just declare itself to be american pie lite, but it doesn't, it makes sure you don't leave the cinema believing it to be anything other than an 'art' film by slowing the pace and holding sterile (but beautifully composed!) images for an eternity. It reminded me a bit of Zabriskie Point in that respect.Irony of this movie is that the shell shocked wife and the homophobic husband next door are more endearing than the central family, that is until he turns out to be an abusive repressed self hating homosexual homocidal nazi fantasist (doh). Can't Alan Ball write an oppressive and domineering father without adding these ridiculous traits? What kind of idiocy is this? I always thought that the mindsets mocked in Woody Allen films were a myth, turns out they exist! They belong to Hollywood writers. Kids, if your father is strict PLEASE take heed of this film, check under his bed for the copy of the protocols of the elders of zion and examine your shower unit because the moment he hits you when he finds out you're involved in drugs he's not far from shooting someone dead. I'm only being as immature as the script.You can argue that the scripts childish exaggerations are necesary to make the film's points hit home (what points?) and create some kind of violent dramatic finale where the protagonist is gunned down (even good american films like Affliction will resort to this, fine, because in that film it is justified) and life affirming realisations and epihanies occur. But really it's an awful lot easier to write such ridiculous characters than actually writing anything genuine and of substance. One can entertain the notion that it is a witty subversion, or a parody of sorts but the truth is its just a very weak piece of self adoring (without any concievable justification) satire with ideas above its station.  it's a smug, facile mediocre comedy that believes itself to be important, its not 'art' (or even very entertaining its so torturously slow and self impressed), it's not anything approaching the 'truth' and it sure isn't a 'wake up call' to any nation.And as for the plastic bag in the breeze... Dude, deep, metaphorical. 'Look Closer', tried, nothing to see here, move along. And they reckon foreign language films are pretentious. The thanking of the plastic bag (apprarently without irony) upon the award of the oscar was truly hilarious. There was gushing, crying and hugging that somehow avoided the mockery that Halle Berry, Gwyneth Paltrow and other embarassing blubberers provoked. Only the 'Life is beautiful' 'director' and his academy award winning performance (and no i am not talking about his acting in the film) have nauseated me more, and to be honest i suspect that was more to do with the film than his live antics. Nice to see quite a few positive reviews of this film on this page resort to abusing (sometimes with name calling! oooh! others with Oscar Wilde) those that didn't find it to be the masterpiece they maintain.And as for the drug dealing teen, i'm sure all of you suburbanites out there knew drug dealers when you were younger, were any of them like this guy? Did they have everything together? Were they competent and business like? Not the ones i knew, they were walking a tightrope most of the time, totally disorganized in all aspects of their life. He's been in a Psychiatric institution for a couple of years and as a result he's totally at ease with himself (?)Really if it weren't for a couple of excellent comic performances this film would be utterly worthless. Mendes next film 'The Road To Perdition' with its reverent self importance, silent gun battles in torrential rain and 'carry on dillinger' second half was pretty awful too, but he's young, handsome and british with a theatrical background who pened his film career with a massive success, so he's a big talent who will be around for a long time doubtless continuing to receive mindboggling comparisons to Orson Welles for as long as his critical stock lasts (hm, apart form anything else i thought Citizen Kane was a box office flop?). Kevin Spacey has since made one of the worst films of its decade 'Ordinary Decent Criminal' and some of us have sat through the excruciating 'Pay it Forward' on vhs, does this guy need a wake up call or what? He's fast dissappearing up his own oscar. But he is critically untouchable it seems, these films didn't even register.And remember...

He knows this and plans to change it all by reliving his younger years before he's killed in less than a year; of course he doesn't know that yet! He meets his daughter's conceited best friend Angela, played by Suvari, and immediately becomes infatuated with her. This begins a period of change for Lester who quits his job, buys the car of his dreams, smokes pot with his young new neighbor and daughter's admirer Ricky Fitts, played by Bentley, and works out to ""look good naked"". His wife Carolyn, played by Bening, on the other hand wants to hit the big time in the real estate world and starts a sexual affair with the real estate king Buddy Kane, played by Gallagher. His daughter Jane, played by Birch,  is an insecure teenager who somehow befriends Angela who is stuck up and, as we find out later in the film, phony. She finds love in neighbor Ricky, whose father Col. Frank Fitts, played by Cooper, is an abusive former military officer.The movie successfully follows each character as the script builds up to the unevitable conclusion with Lester being killed. Director Mendes focuses most on Lester's character, who becomes the hero of the film as he is the only adult in the film who remains loyal and honest, but doesn't neglect the other characters. The best part of American Beauty is watching Kevin Spacey act like an irresponsible young man: smoking pot, benching weights, quitting his job, and fantasizing about Suvari.American Beauty garnered several well deserved Oscars in 2000, including Best Picture, Best Director (Mendes), and Best Actor (Spacey).One of the most memorable movies of the past 10 years!RecommendedA"	5.0	"""Spectacular!"""	2006-03-30	1	1	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2UW83R0JOZZ6	S. Schell	Many people have denounced this movie because of its supposedly undeserved praise at the Academy Awards and in part for the ugly rumors that  circulated as to why it garnered so much exultation. I remember reading  that one person was angry because so many beautiful films that were  nominated, containing deep and intriguing subject matter, were snuffed for  a self-absorbed screenplay portraying a dark and perverse white suburbia.  The film is not about this, and is far from any other dismaying assumptions  people might have made. It is about what each of us perceives as beautiful  in our own eyes, be it purely physical or the beauty we find in each other  deep down in the pit of our fragile souls. It is about being thankful for  the priceless gifts bestowed upon us and finding splendor in the simplest  of things in our every day lives. It shows us that image can only take us  so far before the truth about our personal nature must be revealed and the  consequences we suffer when we dishonor that truth.I'll admit that I was  slightly disappointed upon my first viewing of the movie because of its  incomprehensible and climactic ending. However, upon continual viewings, my  interpretation of it began to change, and I realized why its writer chose a  tragic finale. I saw what message it was trying to convey to its every  viewer, and I felt profound sorrow upon realization of the amount of  ignorance in our world, yet I had a sense of hope. Granted, the film  possesses good amounts of acerbic banter and biting humor to avoid being  completely grave, but its overall message behind the mature and sardonic  jokes is all too significant and more optimistic than some seem to think.  The moral I pulled from it is this: Recognize what is important, because in  the blink of an eye, it could be gone. Life is short, rough, but priceless.  Don't go through it with a narrow mind, either. Open your eyes to  everything around you and force yourself to take a deeper look. There's  something beautiful in every single thing we see, no matter how it appears  at first glance. And no, it doesn't matter what kind of person you are, you  can see anything as long as your heart is open to it.Now that I'm  past the fight for artistic recognition, I'll move on to the stellar  performances that this film boasts. Let's start with our main attraction:  Kevin Spacey. Is there anything this man can't do? The first time I ever  saw him was in the eerie portrayal of the sly and sanctimonious serial  killer John Doe in &quot;Seven&quot;, co-starring w/Morgan Freeman and Brad  Pitt. He continued to impress with debonair bits as the smug prosecutor  Rufus Buckley in &quot;A Time To Kill&quot;, and as Jim Williams, the rich  Southern playboy with a dark secret in &quot;Midnight In The Garden Of Good  and Evil&quot;. But compared to the pessimistic and sardonic persona of  Lester Burnham, I've never seen such an entertaining or more realistic  character portrayed. Lester is the epitome of the middle-aged American  male: 40-hour week job at a boring, sanity-consuming marketing firm  involving telephone promotion run by a self-concerned, money-minded CEO.  There is a dark haze over his satisfaction towards his marriage and his  life, the opinions of his wife and daughter laying waste to his crumbling  self-esteem. It is in the moment that he lays eyes upon Angela Hayes' (Mena  Suvari, the perfect ditz) glamorous visage that his ultimate awakening from  his half-dead life begins to blossom like the rose he envisions. Angela  becomes his obsession, and in his obsession he gains a new appreciation for  himself and revives his fleeting youth.Now for Annette Bening - great  airhead! She's the perfect bitch when the situation calls, but aside from  Carolyn's constant henpecking towards Lester, she's an insecure and  melodramatic woman on the brink of insanity. She too suffers from the  maddening simplicity of every day life, seeking her comfort in her social  status and professional success. She eventually pursues her cure in the  odiferous arrogance and professional guidance of real estate mogul Buddy  Kane, a man with equal insecurities who cleverly conceals them behind a  Mentadent smile and pricey designer suits.Watching from the sidelines  with a constant sneer and a quiet, festering hatred for her parents is the  self-loathing Jane (Thora Birch). I remember Thora from films that catered  to a younger generation, notably the portrayal of a young Melanie Griffith  in &quot;Now and Then&quot;, and the endearing Dani in &quot;Hocus  Pocus&quot;. She has grown into a talented woman with the magnificent  performance she gives in this movie as Lester and Carolyn's pessimistic  teenage daughter. She befriends our beloved, self-involved Angela, hanging  among Hayes' pungently supercilious aura with not a care for her own image  until Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), her new next-door neighbor, fosters an  innocent obsession towards her. The infatuation soon blossoms into a  delicate romance, deep and meaningful. In their love for each other, you  see the modern cliches of America's definition of beauty melt away into a  more profound look at the human soul and all of life surrounding it.This movie is an excellent character study and a delicate look at what lies  in the human heart. I would like to remind those that didn't really  understand the content and gave it poor reviews because of their  incomprehension that misunderstanding is the most common reason for  disliking. I beg of you to watch this film again with an open mind,  disregarding the somewhat strange anecdotes and scenes that were chosen to  remain in the film, but with good reason. You will begin to see its light,  and I hope it will touch you like a film never has...	5.0	What Is Beautiful In Our Eyes	2000-08-14	31	25	6

And I always thought Bening's performance was overrated. I think she's a competent actress but I've seen her to better effect elsewhere. However this is not entirely her fault, for I feel her role was underwritten and one dimensional. Spacey is adequate, I guess. I don't know, it just didn't bowl me over. Darn depressing, too.	3.0	Good...but not Oscar worthy	2000-12-31	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3Q46J5K16CPEQ	StaindCatcherintheryeClockworkorange	"This is one of the most brilliant movies ever made. From the start, when you hear ""Do you want me to kill him for you?"" and then the dreaded ""OK"", the environment is set. Then, there is a pretty suburban neighborhood. No problems, right? Then Kevin Spacey's narration comes on the screen giving insight on everything, and you realise after looking closer (the tagline) that things are not what they appear. Every person in this movie has no formula, they are all so well produced. The writer has created amazing characters. They are all very different except for the fact that they do not understand the concept of how beautiful the world is (american beauty). The movie is about their journey through life and all the obstacles they must go through, and they are still standing, and make the best of everything.With something like this, you would expect a huge soap opera, and crying and screaming every 5 seconds. There are jokes in this movie! This is a light-hearted movie for the most part, which is totally unexpected. This is basically a satire of humans, which is totally original. There are lines like ""Are you trying to look unattractive?"" ""Yes"" ""Well, congratulations. You've succeeded admirably."" That is so much better than saying, say, ""You are so ******* ugly, my god!"" ""Shut up mom! You always complain over and over! I can wear what i want"" ""You are such a bad daughter!"" This movie is so much more artistic than that. There is so much art in this movie, with the roses, and the camera. Everything is perfect. This is the only Best Picture winner of the oscars that i really LOVE.And this movie is not just some depressed guy letting out his insecurities. There is a moral too, which is to appreciate life for what it is, and not what life is not. Ricky helps motivate this moral by showing a video clip of a bag on the street flying with the wind, and saying how beautiful it is. That is genius. No movie would ever in a million years think of something like that. Everybody says Ricky is so weird, but the point is that being ordinary is, for the most part, a bad thing. This movie tells you to be yourself and be original. This is not as negative as everybody else claims it is. Ricky is my favorite character from any movie. Look at this quote:""It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing and there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it. And this bag was, like, dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. And that's the day I knew there was this entire life behind things, and... this incredibly benevolent force, that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid, ever. Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember... and I need to remember... Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it, like my heart's going to cave in. ""Absolutely beautiful, and completely inspirational. That quote sums up human life, and what humans do not realize. People need to realize that there is more to life than if a pizza is late for delivery, or if the CD you want is out of stock, or if your partner for a tennis team is not a great player. Sometimes you need to just lie back and take the world for what it is, and realize the beauty of the earth. This movie sums up human life, which no other movie can ever come close to."	5.0	This Movie Sums up Human Life	2005-04-08	4	3	1

To write a synopsis of the plot is an effort in futility, because this movie just cannot be understood without seeing it. Part of what makes it so good is the character development. Every character feels like a real person. You can understand characters that only appear briefly in a few scenes. Ricky Fitts' mother for example. She doesn't even have any crucual lines, but you get the feeling that you know what she's all about. The acting in this movie also contributes to that. Not only are all the characters developed, but the actors know their characters too. Kevin Spacey leads, but even the kids do a phenominal job.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A153UZP9MCVR25	Stephen Marth	OK, OK it's fantasy.  Like the fantasies we saw in childhood watching &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; and &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; but the opposite extreme.  The film is great at depicting the dream life people  haved strived for turn sour due to our own misplaced priorities.  It's  dark, it's negative, it's unusual.  It's also fresh, witty and  entertaining... So laugh at the humor - its odd situations and  ENJOY.Sure it's a depraved look at society.  It's not meant to portray  the typical family but to present aspects of modern family life that many  people will identify with.  Hopefully, few people actually have to deal  with ALL the negative aspects of family life shown in this film.The  artistic imaginary scenes were excellent and the humor was punchy.  Music  was upbeat too.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film mostly because it gave me so  much to think about later.  Even though it's a dark comedy, it has several  conflicts in the story that are playing out simultaneously.The  interaction and reaction of characters is portrayed very well.  It really  demonstrates how a disfunctional family is infected with troubles and they  inflict their feelings on each other - constantly spiralling down rather  than supporting each other.  It's a matter of each character being  concerned with personal goals instead of family objectives and living in  harmony.  The sickness devours the family to the point of breakdown and  resentment between its members.Throughout the movie I kept wondering  what's going to happen next and what's he or she got in mind now?  All  that, even though from the beginning you are told how it will end.  The  only part of the movie I found a turn off was that it was narrated at the  beginning and the audience was told the history of the situation instead of  allowing the viewer to pickup the sense of dreams gone bad strictly be  seeing the scenes played out.  I felt like I was being spoon fed for the  first few minutes and it distracted from the movie.  From then on it was  excellent and the ending is GREAT!	4.0	Very offbeat and artistic - I LOVED it!	2000-03-21	5	4	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A27A3AZA7L12N6	Stephen M. Bauer	"Kevin Spacey plays a sexually frustrated, suburban, male head of household who's fed up with his career and chucks it.  His wife is a hypocritical, bitchy career woman with no sexual interest in her husband.  We have the teenage daughter caught in the crossfire and the power struggles. And then there are the wacky neighbors!  Everybody acts out, and there you have the movie!  It should have been named American Tragedy, but Hollywood likes to lighten things up.  They don't like things to get too serious, lest anyone actually learn something.I thought the moviemakers took some typical American issues, like violence, infidelity, and a few others and brought them together.  The moviemakers took the essential drama of these things and made everything else ice-cream parlor suburban.  They didn't show any of the filthy side garbage that actually goes along with this kind of thing in reality.Lester and Carolyn Burnam have a teenage daughter named Jane.  A new family, the Fitts, moves in next door.  Mr. Fitts is a Colonel in the United States Marine Corp.  His son, Ricky Fitts is in high school with Jane.  Colonel Fitts wife, Barbara, is a basket case.  Jane knows about Ricky from the rumor mill.  He used to go to school with them but was sent away to an institution.The movie made me laugh my ass off.  I couldn't take it seriously, like most people did.  Few people that I have spoken too took it as a comedy.  Although the Lester Burnham is hilarious, that's all there is to him.  His phony wife is as superficial as the business suites she wears.  Her method of dealing with a serious emotional issue is to chant slogans learned at a sales seminar at a Holiday Inn.  She (played by Annette Benning) is so empty and absurd you have to laugh at her.  Mother and father had no depth at all.  However, the acting of Kevin Spacey, who played Lester Burnham, was outstanding, a ""10.""  His acting pulled the whole movie to a higher level.  All of the characters were well balanced, although the moviemakers should have spent more time expounding on the character of Thora.  I felt she was essential to understanding the movie.I felt the marine colonel who lived next door was almost real.  The character was obviously created by an insightful, gay screen-writer with a sharp politically-correct ax to grind.  For what little time he spent on screen, the character had showed much more depth than the other two adults.  The only thing I'm skeptical about is that he was so extreme, I'm not even sure if the Marine Corp would put up with him these days.Angela, an aspiring model and girl friend of Jane's is a whole pick-up truck full of insecurities and inside-out values.  You can see plenty of girls like her every day on the daytime talk shows.  She's utterly pathetic.Ricky, the high school kid next door is a sicko of the first order.  Think Colombine High School.  He's become a tremendous financial success selling drugs.  Initially I felt anxiety about the relationship between Lester Burnam and Ricky, but ended up thinking it was healthy for the both of them, except for the drugs, of course.The real characters in the movie were the daughter, Thora, and the kid next door, Ricky.  The daughter had a fair dose of intelligence and common sense and pretty good emotional maturity for a girl of her age.  She was introspective and sized up other people very well, her parents, her girl friend and Ricky.  She knew she needed her parents to be parents.  Psychologically, she was quite robust and healthy.  She will survive and thrive, despite her knucklehead parents.  Ricky, the high school kid next door was real.  He was very intelligent, very talented and had a good personality.  I don't think most viewers realize what a wonderful person he could have grown up to be, had things been otherwise.  In the future, he could have been a successful professional in any field he chose.  I can easily imagine him selling corporations instead of drugs.  The problem was that psychologically, he was damaged beyond repair by his sado-masochistic, homosexual, homophobic father.  Ricky is the real tragedy of the movie.Thora and Ricky symbolize American society, she the healthy part, he the dysfunctional.  And together they go off, hand-in-hand-our future."	4.0	Provocative tale of life in the suburbs	2002-07-12	6	2	4
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3VLYCQV5I2MBW	Stephen M. Prescott	FOR: As art, American Beauty helps us to re-examine the meaning of our lives by giving us a glimpse of very delicate, important things that reside at the periphery of consiousness.AGAINST: The movie depicts sin without condemning it. Like so many other films of its kind, it depicts family life as full of loneliness and despair.CONCLUSION: Art is inherently subversive. In an era of lawlessness and want, such as the Dark Ages, art attacks what lies at the heart of the savagery of existence in favor of order and hope. In our prosperous era, however, art subverts the institutions of civilization by prying them open and revealing unpleasant, hard truths. A century ago, with the likes of Ibsen and Shaw, one could have honestly supported the hope that we could face the hard truths and that all of it would somehow bear good fruit. Now, amid the moral and social wreckage that surrounds us, only a fool would.Children are precious. Take a child with a character flaw and point out the truth about it to him. Do it over and over and see his spirit die. Families are also good and precious but they can take only so much hard truth. They must have a veneer of fantasy, if you will, to keep going. And while movies such as American Beauty may point out things that are hard to refute, their effect is to discredit good and needed institutions. This is an interesting film but a bad film -- bad for the family, bad for civilized life.	1.0	For and Against	2011-03-29	21	2	19

This movie earned every award it won and those it didn't. I often don't agree with the films that win awards, but this one was truly the best film of not all the year but of all time, well close.The story is orignal, the writing is fresh, hip and redefines screenplays, the acting is the best around, and the movie is a masterpiece.The film revolves around an all-American family living in the 90s in white suburbia. From the outside their lives look normal but look closer and you will find things are anything but normal.Kevin Spacey leads an all star cast in the performance that won him an Oscar. He plays a father and husband who is sick of the fake life he's been leading, so he quits his job, begins working out, smoking pot, and most importantly he begins living. This sets a whirlwind of events into action that will leave you breathless and will make you look closer at your own life.What I love about this movie is the honest that is has and power it uses to light up the true world we live in. The movie is funny, sad, depressing and life altering.Other stand out performances include, Annette Bening as Spacey's overly joyless wife and Thora Birch as thier unhappy daughter, who ends up being the most normal.You'll love this awesome movie and if you don't you will at least learn from it, if you let yourself.	5.0	the beauty of this movie	2001-08-17	9	4	5
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1LJ334ZTQ21Q0	Stephen Smith	"Albeit I personally have decided that Hollywood produces nothing good, American Beauty is one of its few movies that manages to break free from most signature Hollywood cinemas. In it, a man is faced with the dim facticity of his ordinary life, and decides that this ordinarity is something that he cannot live within. In the far background of the movie, only somewhat recognized and presented by the writer, this man is coming face to face with his finitude, a rarely thought of topic in the average Western man. He is walking about in a nihilistic stupor until a teenage avant-garde opens him up to a lifestyle that he never thought possible. Thus his redemption has form. The teenager, a child of a mental and abusive family, strikes me as an existential Buddhist, at peace with the emptiness of existence, but making radical decisions taken only by the strongest of men (as Nietzsche saw it). Unfortunately, the drugs and sexual relations throughout the plot of the movie diminish the real core; a journey into negative philosophy, where death and nothingness confront the transitory conscious being. The existence of these two ethical breaches are no doubt enough to get the most naive viewers off track right away. But even for those able to see it as a tool, they turn out to be like a hammer punding a screw into a hole, when a hammer is more appropriate for nails. The writer is unable to maintain the postmodern feel that the core of his plot could have produced. This is also seen in the frequent references that ""nothing is more terrible than being ordinary."" The main characters are continually searching for salvation in something they believe will be extraordinary, but the writer fails to realize that redemption is impossible. The teenage avant-garde's image of the world being beautiful, a glimpse of God, was left unsupported. One could view existence in the complete opposite manner and there was nothing in the movie that would have been able to have exemplified beauty over it. But this is certainly a failure of modernity, the naivity of romanticism and of existential philosophies. But the end of the movie presents a little postmodern negative eschatology for the viewer, borrowing on Levinas' conception of the *il y a*. Unfortunately, the ending was a bit dissapointing as well, as the man is shot in the back of the head, and dies content without ever truly facing his own finitude. Certainly there are better movies (especially foreign films), but American Beauty stands out at least a little from the ordinary ethical code that Hollywood is so fond of including in nearly all its films. The writer tried to tackle a concept, and manages to pin down a few good thoughts for the few of us able to catch them."	4.0	A decent flick, for Hollywood	2001-08-26	19	2	17

The actors do a good job with the material provided, but the script is so loaded with cliches that no amount of acting ability can bring the characters to life.  'The Ice Storm' provides a more detailed (and believable) look at suburban families in crisis.  'American Beauty' on the other hand tries to substitute cynicism for insight.  This is pretty commonplace these days.  It gives screenwriters the chance to congratulate themselves for 'deep' material and film critics the chance to use terms like 'dysfunctional family'.  It doesn't make a great movie however.  Worth a rental if you haven't seen it, just to see what the buzz is (or was) about.	2.0	Another cliched look at Suburbia.	2001-07-22	22	15	7
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2ARRAMXWT83PT	Steven Adam Renkovish	This movie is surely one of the year&#8217;s best movies and an instant classic. Never have I seen a movie that tapped into the real, true depiction of suburban life as this movie did.The story revolves around Lester Burnham, a lonely husband and father whose life has slipped away before his eyes. He and his family have not been getting along well, and things are not right. In fact, he is already dead. Yes, the narrator, Lester, is talking to us from beyond the grave.He wakes up every morning, attends his job in advertising, and goes home to his family to have dinner and socialize. This family has slowly fallen apart over the years, and everyone has issues, especially Lester. His wife and daughter both think that he is a loser. His daughter does not want anything to do with him. He is too &#8220;weird&#8221; for her to be around. His wife is a real-estate agent, who is in a high competition with another firm.Like I said before, everyone in this movie has issues. Jane, Lester&#8217;s daughter is your basic, depressed teenager filled to the brims with angst. She feels that she is not attractive, and to not be attractive makes you &#8220;ordinary&#8221;. She has been saving money for ... implants, and is totally determined to change her image.Lester&#8217;s wife, Carolyn, is having problems with her business. She has not sold a home in a long while, and usually goes into deep depression when she does not sell. She also puts out an image of herself. Everything around her has to be perfect. Her whole image is just a front to cover the pain that she is feeling inside. She feels that if the house is not cleaned right or the roses are not trimmed to utter perfection, then she is worthless.  She often listens to self-help cassettes, and starts off everyday with a lip-syncing of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Rain on my Parade&#8221;. She is an emotional wreck from beginning to end.Then, one night at a high school basketball game, Lester catches sight of a beautiful cheerleader, Angela Hayes, Jane&#8217;s best friend. He becomes awestruck as he watches her in amazement, and from there on, she is all that he can think about, and he would do anything to get her. He starts fantasizing about her. Something in him sparks. He realizes that he would do anything to attract her to him.Meanwhile, the new next-door neighbor, Ricky Fitts, has his own problems. His dad is an ex-military officer and is very demanding and beats him often, telling him that he needs &#8220;structure and discipline&#8221;. His mother is clearly not there. Her mind is always in outer space, and she never seems to notice all of the chaos that is going on around her. Ricky films everything around him with his camera. Everything is beautiful to him. He sees beauty in the most abnormal things: a plastic bag, a dead bird, even a dead man.Ricky also benefits in Lester&#8217;s changing attitude. He influences Lester to stand up for himself and take crap from no one. He also introduces Lester to pot. Lester goes to work the next day and blackmails his boss, then quits his job, and applies to work at the local Mr. Smiley&#8217;s fast food restaurant. He also starts to work out in order to attract young Angela to him.The rest of the movie is a chronicle of what many of today&#8217;s families are going through. Most of it is disturbing, but it is all an effort to get this most important message out.  Everyone in this movie eventually goes through a change, and this movie should change you also, as you realize what the suburban world is really like today.	5.0	Another view...	2001-05-27	5	0	5
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	American BeautyDirected by Sam MendesStarring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena SuvariParamount Pictures | 1999 | 122m | Rated R | Sep 21, 2010Video:MPEG-4 AVC | 1080p | 2.35:1Audio:English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1French, Portuguese, Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1English: Dolby Digital 2.0Subtitles:English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, SpanishDisc:Single 50GB Blu-ray disc, region freeAmerican Beauty won five Oscars: Actor in a leading role (Kevin Spacey), cinematography (Conrad L. Hall), best director (Sam Mendes), screenplay (Alan Ball) and best picture (Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks). It's a weird tale told in an unusual way.The film contains nudity, violence, bad language, drug use and smoking, so the R-rating is warranted.We learn during the opening narration that our protagonist, Lester Burnham (Spacey), is going to die. The events leading up to his eventual death are funny, moving, sad and unpredictable. Burnham is a pathetic character entering a mid-life crisis and the film shows how his character changes, as well as the lives of the people around him. There is a significant amount of character development in this story. The choice to use Burnham as a narrator was inspired and adds to the feel of the story.It's not strictly a comedy, but it's full of dark humor that is hard to predict. In short, it's the funniest kind of humor. If you found Fargo or any of Quentin Tarantino's films amusing, you'll probably laugh at this too.Burnham changes his life by becoming more assertive and ceasing to care what other people might think. This catalyst for this rebellion is a meeting with his new neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) who gets high with him before quitting his job on the spot.One of the most important themes of the film is beauty, as you might guess from the title. What is beauty? How do different people define beauty? The contrast between how the characters view other people is startling in places. Some like what they are told to like and dress how they are told to dress. Others are true individuals and express themselves differently. It's interesting to see. You might even find yourself changing your own opinion of what is beautiful as the events unfold.Another theme is the dysfunctional family. The two main families - the Burnham's and Fitts' - couldn't be more different. The one thing they do have in common is that they are living a lie and mostly playing the roles assigned to them by society. They gradually change throughout the movie and try to bring meaning to their lives. we all do this to some extent in our own lives. Why do you do what you do? What do you really want from life and why? Do you set goals in order to get there, or just let things happen? Burnham tries to make things happen.I'm probably in the minority, but I consider this Spacey's best role. American Beauty just makes my Top 10 of all time and it's largely due to his performance. The supporting cast also does good work. His wife (Annette Bening) deals with Burnham's change in her own way while their daughter (Thora Birch) ignores both parents and lives her own life. Chris Cooper has a small but important role as Mr. Fitts.Mendes has taken a look beneath the surface of the American family. It seems that everyone has secrets and chooses to hide them from almost everybody else. The film has humor, sadness, an air of mystery and considerable tension, despite the revelation of Burnham's impending death in the opening narration.Video Quality 3.5/5The Sapphire Series is off to an inconsistent start. While Braveheart was given an exceptional transfer, Gladiator was not so lucky. There was also an audio problem on Saving Private Ryan. The good news is that Paramount offered a free upgrade to fix the problems. Unfortunately, many people will be disappointed with American Beauty on Blu-ray.There's no question that the picture quality is significantly better than that of the DVD. The problem is it's inconsistent. The majority of the film is plagued by frequent white speckles on the image and occasional print damage. Detail is vastly improved, but the images still look a bit drab and subdued due to the source material. Colors look good throughout and red is boosted in some scenes as Mendes intended.The few scenes involving Ricky's camcorder look terrible. I know that it's due to the source material, but the contrast between those scenes and the main movie is huge.Audio Quality 4.5/5The DTS-HD Master Audio track is a big improvement. Ambient sounds such as rain falling are easy to pick out. Thomas Newman's haunting score sounds impressive and adds to the overall mood of the film. Dialogue is always easy to understand and the louder scenes, such as Burnham rocking out while driving, have considerable punch. No complaints at all about the sound presentation.Special Features 3/5Commentary by Sam Mendes and Alan BallAmerican Beauty Look Closer (21:52)Storyboard with Sam Mendes and Conrad L. Hall (1:01:20)Theatrical Trailers (3:00 and 1:22)Similar MoviesAmerican Beauty has a unique feel so it's hard to suggest similar movies. Revolutionary Road, also directed by Mendes, is another movie exploring dysfunctional families and people living a lie. It's not as good though and the characters don't have the same appeal. Strangely enough, I'm also reminded of Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox. While it's stop motion, the themes and quirkiness of the story are similar. And finally, check out Magnolia. It's a sprawling study of several different characters and the threads are drawn together expertly by director Paul Thomas Anderson.Overall, I was pleased with the presentation, but the white speckles were too frequent to be overlooked and were a distraction. I'm not sure whether that could be fixed without a full restoration. If you're a fan of the film, buy the Blu-ray and enjoy the enhanced presentation, but temper expectations.

All I saw was nihilism (which itself is often mistaken for &quot;art&quot;) and sensationalism.  Of course most people seem to eat that stuff up, though.  I've sat next to people who giggled at the masturbation scenes, and at Bening during her sex scene, and I thought, &quot;Am I missing something?  Is THIS what warrants an academy award these days?&quot;You've got your obligatory good-looking white goth kids, with parents who don't understand them (how original!)...You've got a VERY stereotyped, ridiculously far fetched sub-plot about a &quot;homophope,&quot; who tries to get with the same man whom he thinks is having sex with his son...(sounds like a bad HBO mini series)And then there are the characters, none of which draw any sort of sympathy whatsoever.  How does the father liberate himself from his depression?  By lusting after one teenager, getting high with another, and neglecting his family.  How does the wife liberate herself?  By having an affair.  And the kids?  They talk about murdering their parents.  There are no sophisticated or interesting relationships between characters here...just BAD ones.  All are infantile and selfish.  The point being...?And music?  I love The Who, but apparently you don't have to compose new music for films anymore...This is an MTV generation movie.  It panders to the lowest common denominator with ridiculous sex (like &quot;American Pie&quot; or &quot;Something About Mary&quot;) and &quot;shocking&quot; violence, ala &quot;Boogie Nights.&quot;  Ho-hum.  Then it slips in some &quot;arty&quot; moments with the rose petals and the plastic bag.  But it never asks you to THINK, or to put together information in an intelligent way.  It insults the intelligence of the viewer, and the worst thing is that MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN NOTICE.	1.0	How Did This Movie Win 5 Academy Awards?!?	2001-10-17	33	15	18

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2KKMNRDSA2X74	Steven Woodhead	When American Beauty came out on DVD i was very hesitant to buy it because i prefare British movies but this one of the few films i agree with the critics. Kevin Spacey is excellent as 40 something Lester Burnham from the begining i felt for poor Lester (his anology of the after life is my favourite part of any film ever). As gets persucuted from by his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and his Daughter Laura (Thora Birch) for daring to revolt against his &quot;normal&quot; suberban life.His revolt begins one night when he goes to see lauras cheerleading group(my second favourite part of the film) he meets Angela (Mena Suvari)lauras best friend and they both change each others lives when Angela realises she has feelings for lester. One of the stangest characters is the Burnhams new next door neighbours particulary there son the drug dealer who spies on Laura and ends up selling Lester Drugs. This Has to be regarded as the greatest fim of the 1990's mainly due to the emotional performances from Spacey and Suvari and if there is a dry eye win the last 20 mins your more manly then i am i have seen it at least 10 times and i always end up crying in the end 20 mins. So i would like to congralulate Sam Mandes on a superb film which is both funny and emotional something hard to do nowadays.Kevin Spacey on been in my opinion been my favouite male character out of any film and finally Mena Suvari who is my favourite hollywood babe and her character is the best piece of acting by a woman in any film. So in conclusion go buy this film it will be the best purchase youve ever made . Thank You.	5.0	American Beauty The Film Of Our Time	2001-09-15	2	0	2

It protrays suburban midlife-crisis in a very smug, ridiculous, and pretentious manner. The characters have about as much depth and substance as those in a TV sitcom. They're shallow, smug, and superficial charicatures. The music, cinematography, and Wes Bentley's performance as the boy-next-door are the only redeeming qualities of this movie. If you want a more honest portrayal of a American suburban family in midlife-crisis, rent Robert Redford's ""Ordinary People"" from 1980.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1W584W9UW3XEU	"strega2 ""strega2"""	I was prepared to like this film before I saw it, given the extraordinary critical acclaim it drew. But I was unprepared for the emotional wallop of the characterizations: Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening give two of the most  brilliant performances I've ever seen, as the severely dysfunctional couple  whose marriage is unravelling. The lesser roles are played to perfection:  Thora Birch as their angry and confused daughter; Mena Suvari as her  seductive and self-absorbed girlfriend, for whom Spacey develops a driving  obsession; Wes Bentley as her next door neighbor, who maintains a lucrative  business in illicit drugs to support his obsession with filming everything  around him, including the daughter, who becomes his lover. Chris Cooper  plays the boyfriend's brutal Marine father, oblivious to what is going on  around him. It would be a shame to discuss the plot and spoil its many  unexpected twists and turns, but this film draws you in deeper and deeper  into the growing tension and alienation of Spacey and Bening's marriage, as  the teenagers struggle to find the &quot;beauty in life&quot; that gives  the film its title, and Bentley attempts to capture with his camera. You  may have some trouble accepting the fact that a drug-dealer is the sanest  character in this film, but that's an indication of how severely alienated  the characters are. Spacey's announcement in the first few minutes that  &quot;In less than a year, I'll be dead,&quot; makes his character's  gradually evolving self-acceptance all the more emotionally  heart-wrenching.. This is the kind of film that should be seen several  times, to pick up the subtleties you miss while being riveted by the  performances at first viewing. Definitely one of the most original and  unforgettable films of recent years.	5.0	It Deserved Every Rave Review It Got	2000-06-22	9	5	4

Then there is the cast. I thought Thora Birch and Kevin Spacey were simply magnificent. They were in complete control of their roles and tagged each scene perfectly. They possesed the camera. Sure, Wes Bentley, Annete Benning and Chris Cooper really hit their marks- but again, Spacey and Brich stood out the most to me, personally.I must admit, the movie depressed me and brought me to tears at moments- I don't want to say why, becasue it would give away major plot lines. Honestly, I was not allowed to see this at first, and I now understand. This movie is one of the deepest, most perplexing and saddening storyies I have ever seen brought to the Silver Screen.  This movie deals with everything considered coming of age or teenager. And surprisingly, alot of this is partrayed best and most through Kevin Spacey's middle aged, mid-life crisis suffering character.Sure Thora Birch and her counter part played by Wes Bentley are teen enough. But hey, Kevin Spacey was everything rolled into one. And the thing with the Colonel, that was very teenager/coming of age/ deciding which path you must take-esque.I can really elate with some of the feelings portrayed in this film and I give it seven-stars.

If you enjoy deep, thought provoking movies that make you stop and think about the way things appear, then this is an excellent movie for you.

Okay so this movie was making a statement about what is wrong with America today, it's supposed to deal with the superficiality of the American suburbs, the hypocrisy of family today, blah blah blah. You get all of that within the first 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of it is all rose petals falling and an excuse pass off nudity as &quot;art&quot;. At no point in this movie was it necessary to for us to see Mena Suvari's breasts. They were totally completely superfluous to the movie. But, hey, this movie is an &quot;artistic masterpiece&quot; so, therefore some nudity is required. Every single scene in this movie was the director screaming from the rooftops: &quot;look at me, I'm making an artistic movie and since many of us aspire to be 'intellectual', i.e. pretentious, we'll praise it because it's 'different' &quot;. What was the point of this movie? Was he trying to get across a message that something is wrong with American society today? If so, he could have done it without Mena Suvari's breasts, the rose petals, and of course the most &quot;beautiful scene in the whole movie&quot; - I refer of course that oh-so-profound scene where the the marijuana-peddling voyeur neighbour says that the plastic bag flowing in the wind was so beautiful. Gosh, that statement had me almost emptying my stomach in the wrong way. Ok, I'll admit that at certain points in the movie, I had to laugh out loud, there was definitely some good humour, but most of this movie, was a useless, senseless, pretentious waste of film. So the director wanted to make the statement that something was wrong with society today. Tell me something I don't know. Look for the beauty in everyday life? Sure, but it wasn't anywhere in the movie. Compare this to another movie which wanted to bring home the tragedy of the twisted world we live in - Life is Beautiful. The director of that movie didn't need to show breasts, didn't even need to use curse words and what little violence there was was implied. Yet it brings home to all of us, how cruel and beautiful and complex human beings are. Another good movie which released around the same time - Fight Club. Also a very brilliantly done movie. The best way to get a social message across is subtlety. This movie was as subtle as sledgehammer. All this movie does is take the worst possible in all of us and put it onscreen. Either way, there was no reason for anybody to see Mena Suvari's breasts. Of course this review will just be voted least helpful, but hey, somebody had to be brave enough to criticize this movie.	1.0	Even one star is too generous	2001-11-14	40	14	26
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2YJ1L1THT3NUQ	tawinter	"The ability of a movie to get its audience to identify with the characters of the story is one of the things that make it memorable and well written.  Movies try and achieve this audience connection through teaching lessons, making audiences cry, giving comedy, or providing thrill.  In American Beauty, written by Alan Ball, the audience's ability to make connections with the dynamic characters can be done through the real-life situations that they are put through, with me in particular identifying with Jane and her family situation.The Burnham family, as a unit, was something that I was able to relate to.  My own family also consists of a mother and father, neither of which has ever been divorced.  My mom is the main source of income for my family, just as Caroline was.  However it's Jane, the teenage daughter in the family that I find myself relating with in two main ways.  First of all, it is through pathos that I could understand her situation with Ricky in the beginning of the movie.  Since there is no shortage in creepy guys, the awkwardness and anxiety that she felt toward Ricky at the start was definitely relatable to me.  Second, the scene in which Jane and her mother are arguing near the end of the movie reminded me of my relationship with my own mother.  Especially the part when Caroline gets so emotionally involved that she slaps Jane across the face.  Not that my mom makes a habit of slapping me, but she is the main disciplinarian in our house, and she can be pretty strict.  Let's just say that our personalities have clashed a few times, and so I was able to identify with Jane's character during that scene.  One reviewer conquers with my idea when he talks about how he could see himself in the character of Ricky in American Beauty.  He empathizes with Ricky's ""struggles and his longing for beauty in the world"" and this relationship, he says, is ""what lends the movie such a great power.""  The fact that I was able to identify with Jane in American Beauty made the movie more memorable.There were, of course, characters of which I was unable to relate to very well.  Since I have never been in the Marines nor am not a closet homosexual it was hard for me to relate to Colonel Fitts, but throughout the movie we see him struggle with keeping his secret suppressed.  Who hasn't had something that they were trying to keep secret?  However, when a reviewer, says ""I couldn't see any real people, or even ideal people that used to populate Hollywood fare.  Instead, I kept seeing this PC playbook, written by some narcissistic baby-boomer who demands people view his movie with an open mind, but he himself sees life with blinders on.""  He also ridicules the slogan of ""Look Closer"" through describing the characters as not characters at all, but ""representatives: of social and political agendas.  Though Jones does have point in saying the movie displays some of the usual suburban themes; such as, gay repression or teenage rebellion, he is way off base his description of the characters as being ""representatives"" and ""unrealistic.""  The decision that Jane had of whether she was going to run away to New York with her new drug dealer boyfriend or continue living with her family that was falling apart seemed like it was pretty emotional and real.  Though some of the characters may be harder to relate to, the characters of American Beauty have the ability to be identifiable to relate to some sort of audience.  That's why I think that anyone who watches the movie would like it."	5.0	Character Connections	2006-04-06	2	1	1

And believe it or not--the storyline is just as clear now as it was then. Lester is unhappy with his life and makes an effort to change it. A previous reviewer went on about how Lester wasn't a true protagonist. I beg to differ. Lester represents about 95% of the middle aged men in America. He is sexually frustrated, he has an awful relationship with both his wife and kid, plus he wakes up every morning to work a dead end job that makes him unhappy. Other than continuing down this miserable path, he does something about it. He chooses to better himself, and that ultimately makes him a hero. In my opinion, he's the bind that holds the movie together. He uses a very dark, morbid sense of humor that cracks me up every time he's on screen. His actions are justifiable. And also somewhat relatable.-Another thing I like is the movie's incredible use of imagery. American Beauty has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. The scenery is absolutely breath taking. And it's simple--not too over the top. They didn't have to travel across seas to find amazing landscapes. They just took a contemporary American home and made it both symbolic and beautiful.-The scripting is also right on point. Today's movies have way too much dialogue. But Beauty's characters say more through their actions than they ever could with words--and that's a rare find in recent cinema.-American Beauty is just that. A beautiful film that centers around a dysfunctional American family. It's dark, depressing--yet realistically portrayed. I would definitely recommend.	5.0	Beautiful!!	2005-08-01	7	5	2

Here is a man, so brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Spacey, who so desperately wants to bond and fails at every turn.  His wife, done to the hilt by Annette Benning, is a perky, go-get-em real estate broker who, despite her overachieving personality, is apparently unfulfilled with her marriage and her career.  The only difference between she and Lester is that Lester doesn't hide his feelings and often offends his wife during their regular spats.  Their teenage daughter doesn't seem to care much for either parent, and gets involved with a creepy next-door-neighbor (Wes Bentley) who's being raised by his near comatose mother and tough-as-nails Marine dad.Saying more would spoil it for you, but the movie is an original piece of work that snubs the conventions of modern filmmaking.  Its commentaries on dysfunctional relationships, homophobia, isolation, and stereotypes are so dead-on.  Sam Mendes directs the film with style and craft, and the screenplay is so wittily written.  The DVD is also a solid package.  There's a commentary by the director and screenwriter, as well as a brief documentary, and trailers.

It depicts upper-middle-class suburbia as a paradise lost. The almost Freudian perespective of the film delineates the welter of sexual and emotional drives, as well as the projections and repressions responsible for shaping and influencing supposedly &quot;normal&quot; behaviour. The chief characters (the disaffected husband) brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey, his faithless wife (Annette Benning) and their troubled daughter (Thora Birch) are depicted as affluent reapers of the benefits of the American Dream, though their lives are hollow, artificial and pathetic by contrast. This film is a damning overview of America today. The haunting music score, cinematography, scripting, acting and direction are of the highest standard. The film combines domestic tragedy with mystery, character study and some stylised and epiphanic symbolism as in the image of the piece of paper floating in the wind without cease, circling endlessly, circling in a void, roaming as if in desperation, floating with no place to go.	5.0	The dark underbelly of the American Dream	2001-07-02	4	1	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ANYAO2HIXD43D	Theodore C Nicholas	The beginning of the film remains great. An unhappy man, Lester Burnham (played nicely by Kevin Spacey) trapped in an ordinary and pathetic existence. His equally unhappy wife, Carolyn (played Robotically by Annette Benning), and daughter Jane, feel their own personal pain but can't seem to express their feelings to each other. The set up of the film is brilliant. It's a shame it's follow through isn't. Instead, it goes down a one way course of adolescent, trivial nonesense where Lester tries to find some sort of meaning to life by quiting his job, smoking pot and lusting after his daughter's friend, Angela. Too bad Lester doesn't do something significant and daring, the film isn't set up that way. It's takes cliche's one after another, but works out fairly well. The charm of the film relies on Kevin Spacey's humor, which won't disappoint. But the film also takes a downside when trying to delve into Carolyn's life. She has the cliche affair with another man, which doesn't ever seem to pan out. We're left with a robotic image and characature of an unhappy housewife, not a human being.And then there's the teenage aspect. With Jane, everything seems at odds. But then again, that's what being a teenager is all about. With her new love interest, who can't stop filming stuff, it seems interesting. And then the ending, which seems so poetic, so lyrical, it's beautiful. This movie had so much potential to be great.

I was really annoyed by the Father who was love w/ a teen, (and not with his wife), the hysterical wife, and the doldrum daughter. The whole family wouldn't give the time of day to each other. The disturbing way the Colonial treated his son and others was also not inspiring.  Really, I can't remember when I was so depressed watching a film. I was puzzled beyond belief at how this movie recieved such possitive attention.	2.0	Can't Figure Out the Hype	2000-10-02	7	4	3

I also feel that once you get into it, you see a true beauty. I'm kinda of out with the jury here, but I will say  that I liked the ending because Lester was at peace with himself and what  happened. I liked it. Now, the wife, she lived in another zone completely.  The daughter as well,(her and that boy were compatible), and her friend was  just I'm so beautiful.

Winner of the 1999 Oscar for Best Picture, ""Beauty"" sends viewers on an emotional rollercoaster that doesn't waver until the final second of the film.  The Burnham family is the ordinary suburban family but in a way the not so ordinary. As the film first starts out, the family lives in suburbia where they are pretending to happy living in a small town and feel right at home (or at least try to).  Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey in an Oscar-winning performance), our main character who is a 42-year-old man whose middle class, suburban doldrums far exceed the standard middle-age crisis. His fourteen-year career at a magazine publishers is going nowhere, his perfectionist realtor wife, Carolyn (a stupendous outing from Annette Bening), drives him crazy and his angst ridden teenager daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) barely communicates with him, simply writing him off as ""weird."" Things soon begin to change around the Burnham household; however, upon the arrival of several new people who shake things up. While their neighbors on one side are a gay couple, Jim (Scott Bakula) and Jim (Sam Robards), the once vacant house on the other has now been occupied by the Fitts family. Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper, who was snubbed of an Oscar win for Supporting Actor) is a stern, military man whose wife, Barbara (Allison Janney), seems to be in state of domestic shell shock.Little do they know that their eighteen-year-old son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), a boy so obsessed with life and beauty that they once institutionalized him for two years, is actually a successful drug dealer with a penchant for videotaping everything, including Jane next door.  While that initially creeps her out, Jane soon starts to find Ricky interesting once she gets to know him. That only disgusts Jane's gorgeous cheerleader friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), who thinks Ricky's a pervert although she herself claims she's slept with men just in an attempt to further her aspiring modeling career. When Lester meets both Angela and Ricky, he finds a stirring within himself that he long thought dormant and perhaps dead. With Angela, who openly flirts with him, Lester goes into hormonal overdrive and constantly fantasizes about her, when not pumping iron to get into shape and make himself more attractive to her. With Ricky, Lester finds a kindred spirit whose carefree attitude about life and work -- as well as the expensive pot he sells him -- causes Lester to change his outlook on life. Having successfully blackmailed his former company, Lester sets out to have a good time, not caring that his wife might be seeing local real estate king, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher).As everyone reacts to Lester's newfound attitude with shock, he must deal with the fact that Carolyn doesn't like his new self, that Jane half-jokingly asked Ricky to kill him, and that Colonel Fitts becomes suspicious of Lester's involvement with his son.  The irony inherent in this film, and it grows with resonance as the piece draws to a conclusion, is that the only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything in order to achieve it. Yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able to afford the surviving characters a glimpse of hope in life.  This film will leave audience's gasping for air: its hyper-realism conveys, at the same time, a portrait of the suburban comedy, a jolting-shock of realization, and a cathartic sense of hope. Mendes depicts a certain people who, to varying degrees, all strive for a certain 'American Dream', yet so few actually attain it. Thomas Newman's riveting, beautiful musical score accompanies the eloquent and demanding characters as they flow through their lives with whistful nature and mystique.  Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the 'feel good' label, the beauty of ""American Beauty"" is that it sits half-way between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best.  Simply one of the grandest American films of all time."	5.0	American Beauty  (1999)	2005-12-30	3	2	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A22QTZ5F98PSBS	"""thezerg"""	American Beauty is one of those rare movies that tend to make a world love it.  This movie is a comedy first off, but a dark one at that.  You can  watch it and realize what a great movie this has become.  Upon viewing the  trailer to the movie, I thought it would be just a sexy raunchy film with  just some special effect (the flower petals) and a bland storyline.  However, upon viewing the actual movie, I was shocked and blown away at  just how good this movie is.  An cast that really brings the movie to life  and a plot that will have some thinking and others offended.  The movie is  more than just what most think, it's really about the hidden beauty within  the world, within ourselves and within our minds.  But don't let that fool  you, the movie is funny all the same, but smart funny, not fart fart funny.  Probably the best feature about the movie is Kevin Spacey and his role as  a man simply wanting the younger beauty the world has to offer, but this  has gotten many offended, but it's very interesting as to how he deals with  it, it's also hilarious.  Keeping the ending a secret, you'll suprised what  is to come of this tale.  Buy it, I can almost promise you that you'll love  it.	5.0	The Dark Side of Comedy!	2000-08-14	1	0	1

Some of the best acting I have seen in many years, and the conclusion was  fantastic.  It is a movie that really makes you take a look at your life  from an outside perspective.  If this movie does not win best picture and  get best actor at the oscars I will be very upset.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A8M4WE1MT4R4O	thomas angelo zunich	This is one of my favourite movies ever.  I think the best time to watch it is when your extremely depressed, the message sinks in more.  Every performance in this film is brilliant.  I especially liked Mira Suvari's performance, her character grew on me.  Of course, one of the most poignant scenes is the infamous Wes Bentley scene with that bittersweet dialogue &quot;there's so much beauty in the world, etc....&quot;  When I saw that scene, I sort of cried, it was embarrassing.  But if that one scene doesn't affect you with any emotional impact, you don't have a pulse.  One new tidbit I discovered about &quot;American Beauty&quot; after reading the credits is, Paula Abdul did the choreography for the cheerleading sequence, interesting........Everyone I have talked to absolutely loved this film, I can't imagine any bad critism.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AS1R4JPHVKER7	Tiffiny Mackey	I went into this movie not sure of what to expect.  I had seen the posters (you know, the ones that say &quot;look closer&quot;) and heard the buzz surrounding this film, so I went to see it with an open mind.  And that is  how I came to &quot;look closer&quot; at the beautiful film that is  American Beauty.  From the images of the pristine suburban backdrop in  which the characters attempt to live their lives, to the image of a lone  plastic bag dancing in the wind, I saw beauty in a way I'd never seen it  before.  I let all the glorious, and at times, troubling, images seduce me  and lead me into a world that cast me under its spell.  I've never walked  away from a film so utterly immersed in my own perceptions of what I had  seen until I left the theater after the first time I viewed this  extraordinary masterpiece of the modern-day human condition.  I was so  mesmerized, in fact, that I went back two more times, just to lose myself  in the world of the Burnhams and the people that affect their lives so  profoundly.  The strangest thing about this film, and the reason it is so  wonderful, is that you lose yourself in a world that could very well be the  world in which you live.

And don't be shocked or ticked, because the first sentence of the first narration states that he will die, and this story is why.The reason for the 5 star treatment: 1: It kept my attention and interest the entire film. 2: The excellent performances by Kevin Spacey and the other actors and actresses. 3: The comic relief that relaxes some of the tension that builds toward the end of the film. 4: The plastic bag, THAT WAS COOL, I love photography and art, and that was talented and took hard work Im sure (In case your wondering that video was A REAL LIFE video filmed by the Director. 5: The clever ways they threw in the words LOOK CLOSER throughout the film.

That way, the foks at the mall can feel good about having sat through a  movie featuring blackmail, murder, and (gasp) sex!!!This film owes a bit  too much to other much darker films, specifically The Ice Storm and sex  lies and videotape and Lolita and Happiness and Blue Velvet.  That American  Beauty is more accessible and less interesting than these films should come  as no surprise, I suppose, considering the quite unwarranted success of the  film.  American Beauty is Independent Cinema Lite.  It takes no hard  stance, takes no chances whatsoever, at least none that have not been taken  several times before by other, far more challenging films.The best thing  about American Beauty is the high quality of the acting, in particular a  splendid performance from Wes Bentley, who really should have been  Oscar-nominated.

That's  the beauty of it, when you see into Lester Burnham's thought's you realize  that you yourself are flawed and that is why you can sympatize with his  character.  Annette Bening screams, kicks, and cries through a marriage  going nowhere and finds solace in another man.  You are looking at people  that at first glance are regular but you are not meant to judge them, you  are meant to look under the surface and see a bit of yourself.  This is a  refreshing work because it digs under the outside of one's persona and  exposes the intracatces of life.	5.0	&quot;American Beauty&quot; the American family the way it is.	2000-06-05	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A2W2KQRYN1QIXV	Tony Carey	I am not sure about this film--I had the same feeling about 'Eyes Wide Shut'--a film with so much hype should have induced a 'love it' or 'hate it' reaction. One of the ways to judge a film is if the images or visual  and narrative metaphors resonate over time. In the end EWS faded and I  decided that Kubrik got stuck in the 70s.I suspect that American Beauty  will also fade, but I am now fascinated by the notion of mainstream  subversion of American icons. This is the usual territory of alternative  cinema or animation (Southpark and the Simpsons), both of which are more  subtle and persuasive than AB.As an Australian I wonder what this film  says about American Culture (we Aussies love to hate (hate to love?)  America): is it a sign of a maturing culture or a decaying one? Is America  coming to terms with its demons or is the 'serpent eating its tail'. Is it  healthy to expose your shadow to the 'neon glare' of Hollywood or have you  just run out of ideas?  I certainly was not bored by this movie but I  suspect that its significance will be judged in time not because it was  technically brilliant (although it was technically good), not because it  had great acting (although many of the performances were excellent) or not  because the images will stay with us (although many were well crafted), but  more because of what is says about the time.For all its blackness  American Beauty still seems a sanitised version of Solondz's 'Happiness' or  Kaye's 'American History X'. But I guess the 'jury's still out'. I'll have  to let it percolate, I'll have to listen to the perspective of others, I'll  have to let time pass on this one.If you can't immediately love a  movie, maybe being undecided is a worthy second for a filmmaker.	3.0	Mainstream subversion	2000-04-25	0	0	0

You will never, ever look at life the same way. It does exactly what movies are meant to do - give us a window into ourselves, and American Beauty does that better than any other film has ever done. No word of dialogue is unnecessary, no character exaggerated, everything is perfect...but if you have seen American Beauty you should know that already. Once you look closer at this movie, and see Beauty in every frame, it becomes so much easier to look closer and see Beauty in everything around you. You think I'm waxing poetic? Then you must not have seen the movie. Every character is a part of each of us: the Lester Burnham of change, the Carolyn of uncertainty and failure, the rebellion of Jane, the defeated Barbara, the false control of Angela and the Colonel, and the real control of Ricky. To me Ricky, not Lester, is the center of this story; he somehow controls or sets in motion the heart of Lester's rebirth and downfall. There are several parts of this movie where I lose control every time I see it, and none more so than the paper bag scene. To me that scene is simply the greatest monologue ever written.I listened to the message of American Beauty - look closely and you can find Beauty in anything - and it changed my life. I rose out of a long, deep depression and started out into the world. Sometimes there is so much Beauty in the world, I can't even stand it, and it feels like my heart is going to burst.This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.	5.0	Fantastic	2007-06-22	8	4	4

Namely, the parts where Kevin Spacey and Mena Suvari were absent.  I think too much of the middle of the movie focused heavily on the two teenage kids, and those parts were kind of slow.  I really wished that the movie had a bit more of the entertaining Kevin Spacey, and the drop-dead gorgeous Mena Suvari.  (The scene between Spacey and Suvari toward the end was awesome!)

A civilization that does not come out so nicely from this portrayal.An example of this would be one of the movie's strongest parts when Annette Bening obsessingly scrubs the house she intends to sell, telling herself ""I will sell this house today"" over and  over again as a mantra and then breaking apart at the end of the day.. Crying and slapping her face for crying... What I mean is that I judge this behavior to be very American in the sense that Americans are great believers of the self power to change one's self and the reality surrounding him, and yet, this scene can also be viewed as a cosmopolite statement about loneliness - the fact that by the end of the day all you have is yourself only, and the ways people find to make themselves miserable.... all on their struggle to what they see as happiness (money? .... Success?)I loved Kevin Spacey in this movie. I think his character is what gives this movie its charm. This could have been a totally depressing movie and is a little less so as his character somehow manages to give some comic relief - to be funny and heartbreaking at the same time. Lester has something about him that totally appeals to all of us - the courage to throw everything away - sort of achieving every one secret wish. He manages to be a total loser and a hero at the same time. This character is so human - and such a contrast to the phony uptight wife. I found the scene where he reaches out for her to be very touching... however she is more interested in the sofa.And yet, life can be beautiful and this too comes out from the movie. There can be so many good things and Lester does not need to work in a ""real"" job to be happy. The other characters seem all to be in a search of happiness -  Ricki can see beauty only through his camera so it seems and when he is behind the camera he can become one with nature and with his surrounding. There is so much contrast between his ""art"" - and the beauty he can find in filming a plastic bag moving in the wind and the kind of life he leads, full of lies and deceit. He has found his way of ""surviving"" and in a way so did the other characters. The problem starts when these survival methods are shattered such as with Angela, Jane's friend, or when Carolyn's pretenses and fake up world is exposed. Lester is the only one who did not have pretenses (he had one secret re Angela but I feel that at least towards himself he did not lie about it) and thus I see him as a tragic hero. He did not ""pretend"" or lie, and yet paid the price for the others dishonesties."	5.0	Beautiful.	2003-06-03	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AR0TYZQ1GSEC1	T.S. Morris	American Beauty certainly isn't a bad movie, in fact parts of it are hilarious.  It just isn't as profound as it would like to be.  The &quot;message&quot; is that sometimes things are not what they appear.  Yeah, I think we all know that, big deal.  If American Beauty had just been  a comedy, it could have been great, but it has an awkward tone that ruins  everything.  Another flaw is that it isn't nearly as shocking as the  filmmakers would like to think it is.  It is like if Todd Solondz's  Happiness was sanitized and watered down for mass consumption, removing  anything interesting or thought provoking.  American Beauty seems like it  is a sitcom with profanity in it, and ironically, it was written by a  former sitcom writer.  The acting is very good but not Oscar worthy  (Russell Crowe deserved to win, without a doubt).  All in all, you might as  well watch it, just to see what all the fuss is about, but I don't think it  is worth buying.	3.0	Don't 'look closer', you will be disappointed	2000-04-25	6	2	4
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1OJLQJHLOYZ9G	T. Stone	The power of this film is such that when, during my first viewing, someone said something stupid (&quot;Whooo!&quot; or &quot;Sweet!&quot; or something) when Angela opens her shirt, I honestly wanted to smack him. A rather disturbing story of lust, near statutory rape, adultery, murder, and drugs on the surface, this movie is really about escaping the drudgery of the prison-like existance which many lives, even those of the wildest college students, become upon reaching middle age and becoming part of suburbia. It is also about finding the beauty in the unnatural, the trashy, the stupid, the superficial, and the tragic. Really, the movie is best described by it's multi-level title: American Beauty, the rose which is a recurring image, the vacuous teenaged cheerleader/slut, the suburban landscape, and a piece of trash, floating in the wind. The film itself is perhaps the greatest piece of American Beauty that ever I've seen.	5.0	Visually and emotionally stunning	2004-07-23	5	4	1

American Beauty is no exception.  The movie takes the traditional family unit (you know, two  parents - one male, one female, with children) and makes a complete mockery  of it.  In addition, the role played by the ex-Marine neighbor portrays  military personnel (to whom this country owes way too much gratitude) to be  psycho fruitcakes.  I hated this movie.  I work too hard at making a good  stable home-life for my husband and children to accept that the message in  this movie is anything but destructive.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	ATK261RD0KT0B	uiowa	The movie American Beauty invites viewers to look closer.  It proves that everything is not as it seems to be and that fully understanding something means looking past the surface.  It follows the maturation and change of the Burnham family.  While following the journey of the characters in the film, director Sam Mendes effectively exhibits each characters growth and development.The movie takes place in a stereotypical suburban city.  The Burnham family on the outside seems to be a happy, normal family.  They have a large, beautiful home, in a nice neighborhood, Lester and Carolyn Burnham both have good jobs, and they have one daughter, Jane.  But if one looks closer, as the tagline directs, they see that it is a actually a very broken family, disillusioned by thoughts of materialism and reputation.  They are all searching for a new meaning of happiness.This film encourages the audience to look closer at each of the characters to see that they are not what they seem to be on the surface.  Each character shows some sort of change throughout the movie.  While each characters growth is noticeable, Lester's change may be the most apparent, even though it is not for the better.  At the beginning of the film, Lester is a reserved, middle-aged man, who seems to be complacent with his situation.  Although he may prefer something else, he accepts what he has.  After a sort of mid-life revelation, Lester decides to turn his life around.  He quits his job, after telling off his employer, buys himself his dream car, stands up to his wife, and begins to change his appearance to gain the attention of his daughter's young friend.  These are all examples of Lester's development.  By taking a closer look at the character's growth, the audience is invited to apply certain questions to their own lives.  As other reviewers agree the film asks the audience to look closer at their own situations.  What do you want in life?  Are you happy?  A film that can encourage change and growth in a viewer's life is often a sign of a well-written, well-directed movie.  The success of this however depends not only on the screenplay and the direction, but also on the talent of the actors.  Winning the Oscar for Best Actor, Kevin Spacey displays a compelling performance as Lester Burnham, which helps the audience relate to the character.One criticism of the movie, as noted by other viewers in their review of the film, may be that it relies too heavily on stereotypes which cause it to be unbelievable.  Although the characters may be strongly stereotypical, including a homophobic military father and a disaffected, apathetic teenager, they are clearly exaggerated to prove a point.  Stereotypes are often based on some sort of truth, and overstatement is often a technique used to amplify an opinion.  While the film is ultimately based on the perception and opinion of the writer, it is the perception and opinion gained from some sort of real-life experience.  Ultimately, even though the film uses stereotypes, they are used in a way to prove a further point to the audience, it goes beyond the stereotype.  In the example of the homophobic, militaristic father, the stereotype is not used to prove that military workers are all homophobic, it actually does just the opposite, to prove that one stereotype cannot exist, especially in the case of Colonel Frank Fitts, as seen by his later interactions with Lester.  This change in Col. Fitts is yet another example of how looking past the surface of a person can reveal their true opinions.After taking a closer look at American Beauty one is convinced that it is a well-written, well-directed movie that clearly follows the progress of its characters in their search for meaning in life.  Although depending heavily on standard ideas to prove its point, the film's redeeming qualities of character development, talented acting, and self-examination confirm its worthiness of respect.	4.0	Perception vs. Reality	2006-04-06	1	0	1

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AU5SQBPSNOIM	"Vanissa W. Chan ""vandelist"""	It's a tragedy that this film won Best Picture (just as it was a tragedy that Shakespeare In Love one the year before, and even worse, Titanic the year before).  It's also a tragedy that this film was incredibly overrated by its viewers.  What does it say?  That so many people can &quot;relate&quot; to the desperate and pathetic characters of this suburbian hell-reality?I thought some of the themes in this film were worthy of presentation.  How ridiculous society (not just middle-America) has become with its over-indulgence of material goods, loss of immaterial and spiritual wealth and wholeness, lack of closeness within the family unit, complete voidness of morals of values...it certainly is a shame!  But the danger of the message in the film is its existential ending, its answer being utter hopelessness and helplessness.  Please.  There are solutions to all of these problems, but unfortunately, neither the makers of the film nor the fans realize this even though they continually ask us to &quot;look closer.&quot;There is some unrealism that should be pointed out in the characters.  I didn't buy the whole &quot;closeted-homophobic military man&quot; character.  I'm not denying that such contradictions in human character exist, however, the film portrayed the character as someone who was mainly concerned with his son, not personal egocentric struggles.  I interpreted Cooper's character's final actions to be purely empathetic and wrathful.  When he kissed Lester Burnham, it was to empathize with his son whom he thought was engaging in homosexual activities with Spacey's character.  When he killed Burnham, it wasn't out of rejection of his homosexual pass, but out of anger for the prostitution of his son.Certainly, the movie deserves some praise for its content, although it is not as original as people claim.  If I am not mistaken, &quot;Ice Storm&quot; incoporated similar themes, and in some ways, was a more successful film in representing society's moral grayness.  I thoroughly enjoyed Kevin Spacey's sarcastic, hedonistic character, (though I do not think it was Spacey's best performance as some have stated.  The deception he created in The Usual Suspects and mystery he upheld in Seven were, in my opinion, more oustanding, substantial, and challenging than his role in American Beauty will ever be) and did empathize with him in the end.It is not surprising that this was a directional debut, as the director overwhelms the audience with its directed narration, leaving no intuitive challenge for the deeper viewer.  I personally desire movies that carry more subtle themes, challenging the audience to understand the meaning of the piece.  With American Beauty, the messages are so naked and apparent that it only encourages brainlessness viewing.Overall, an average movie challenging deep themes.  It deserves this heavy criticism in order to counterattack all the false acclaims it has been given.	2.0	An Average Movie Challenging Deep Themes.	2000-10-20	54	23	31

I've never seen a film that portrayed the ""all-American dream"" suburbean family with such intelligence, hope, honesty, tragedy, and dark humor. This movie doesn't at all sugarcoat any of the characters; instead, the characters sugarcoat themselves. And most brilliant of all, they don't lead us to predictable territory. Just when you think of the typical thing that usually happens, or could have happened, to these characters, things turn around, surprising us with a whole different outcome and consequence. Kevin Spacey's calm narration itself was a chilling contrast to not only the seemingly beautiful and peaceful neighborhood that his character Lester lived, but also to the melancholy and tragic outcome of his life and that of his family and his neighbors. Also, an awesome performance by Allison Janney. Mena Suvari, who played Angela, the sly and sexually obsessed cheerleading teenager that Lester falls for (thus beginning his fantasies for her, such as the memorable roses in the bathtub scene), also did a great job. However, I felt that she made it too obvious that she, too, wanted to seduce Lester. I believe it would have been more affective if she was portrayed as an innocent girl in person, but then naughty in Lester's fantasy world. The fact that she would have had kicks out of seducing Lester to begin with didn't make the fantasy scenes very, well, make-believe. Personally, I felt like the way she spoke to Lester sensually was just kind of cheesy and obvious, purposely catering to Lester's fantasy. I'm sure that was the point, but oh well, that's just the only tiny thing that irked me in the movie. The rest is brilliant, shocking, and just tragic, while still, somehow, bringing upon a message of hope."	4.0	Brilliant Movie!	2006-06-17	2	1	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A18T26PLZD4SRJ	Vic	I read a few negative reviews of this film, and I'm baffled. This film was outstanding. Kevin Spacey is finally getting the recognition he deserves, I thought he should have won an  academy award for, &quot;Swimming with Sharks,&quot; but his portrayal here was equally outstanding. He really conveys in this film, a slice of Americana, no one wants to get old. He truly shows that we may get older outwardly, but the child inside sometimes never truly dies. Mena Suvari, is captivating as the &quot;Lolita- like,&quot; object of his affection. I think Annette Benning was outstanding as his wayward, gold-digging wife, who never  was happy with his career choice. This film is visually  stunning and use imagery to convey it's messages, much like in &quot;What Dreams may come,&quot; with Robin Williams. This is film is definetely, not for children. It's harshly realistic at times, the language is coarse, and there are some scenes that may make people uncomfortable. If you're an open-minded, liberal viewer, you'll probably really enjoy this film. If you are more on the conservative side, and strong material offends you, you might want to look elsewhere.	5.0	American Beauty, &quot;An American Masterpiece&quot;	2000-10-23	4	2	2

This is the most daring role Kevin Spacey's has played since he was in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.  It was very astounding and at the same time, alarming.Anytime you have a character go from a depressed (in a sense), lonely and unhappily married guy to a ragging married guy who doesn't give a damn you know you've struck gold.  Again, Spacey takes the starring role and runs with it.  Many people dub this movie as a &quot;teen movie&quot;, which it's not.  And if you have seen &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; you know what I'm talking about.  But this a great drama flick that topped a lot of other movies in the year 1999.  Anyway, Spacey co-stars with wife Annette Bening as they struggle through a bad marriage and raising a lowly looking daughter.  It offers many surprises, and the 'kid with the bag' is more than just a kid with a bag.  Use your brain a little here, people.I give the director Sam Mendes a lot of credit in making this film.  He did a lot and was able to do it in just over two hours.  I think anyone who likes seemly-twisted dramas or Kevin Spacey would enjoy this one.

The acting is terrific and multi-layered, the editing is great, and it has some of the best lighting I've ever seen.  The movie chronicles the Suburban nightmare of Lester Burns, played by Kevin Spacey.  The characters are all miserable in their own way, but each learns lessons during the course of the movie that help ease their pain.Fortunately, this DVD comes with a commentary track with director Sam Mendes (American Beauty was unbelievably his first movie!) and screenwriter Alan Ball (creator of the acclaimed series Six Feet Under).  Although their commentary is a bit self-congratulatory at times (the movie did win multiple Oscars after all), it is fascinating.  They take you through the entire movie-making experience and detail why certain choices were made.  I learned more about movie making from listening to their ocmmentary than from any book I've ever read.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	AZL0RV52196YL	W. Hamilton	"Alan Ball's screenplay of American Beauty borders on genius. The text and subtext of the movie start at the opening scene:On video: Jane Burnham lays in bed, wearing a tank top. She's sixteen, with dark, intense eyes.Jane: ""I need a father who's a role model, not some horney geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. (snorts) What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery.""The root of the family dysfunction is how they see each other. When Annette Bening's character pulls into a fast food restaurant Spacey's character works at, they trade overly polite remarks, then she shouts, ""Lester, just stop it."" Spacey's character responds, cooly, ""Uh-uh. You don't get to tell me what to do ever again."" That this is at a drive through window is relevant. To the wife, Spacey's character has turned from boyfriend to husband to employee. He's someone to help throw dinner parties. To the daughter, he's a ""horney geek-boy.""Movies focus on what can be seen, and subtext is difficult to get across on film. But it's the subtext that matters. When I say some lame-o comment to Starbucks girl -- ""It's busy today."" -- I don't really mean ""it's busy today."" What I mean is, ""You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, and your beauty frightens me, and because I feel pressured by people waiting in line, and also because I'm not sure you even like talking to me, this is the best I can come up with: It's busy today."" The subtext is the heart of the matter.The subtext of American Beauty comes across in the screenplay. Much of this movie takes place looking through Ricky's camera, or from points of view of other characters. Even the audience's pov: ""Jane looks at us...."" People watch us everyday, and we watch others. People judge personalities, and often get them wrong. The changes the family needs, then, aren't jobs or cars or murder. Each person needs to know that those watching them actually see them, and love them, despite any preconceived notions of what a husband or father or wife should be.Spacey's character often asks for his family to notice him, to ask how his day is going. They respond, Why should we? And that's the problem. Why should we implies being noticed and loved have to be earned. The subtext, however, is, We would, if you noticed and loved us.Midway through, Ricky's character shows Jane a video he took of a homeless woman who froze to death.Jane:  Why would you film that?Ricky: Because it was amazing.Jane: What was amazing about it?Ricky: When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second.

Fortunately, I don't give a crap for low high school girls who complain and whine that their breasts are 2 mm smaller than the average or about a crazy guy who video tapes people who is the son of an even crazier military officer.  Who cares about a movie that is all about teen sex?  A lot more than you think.  Who cares about a person being in Seventeen magazine?  A lot more than you think.  But this movie is not compelling, just plain stupid and way too long.  I can't give you enough reasons not to watch this film.  Take my advice, don't get this film.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A8SXV68RZR4I4	William A. Otis	Although I was -also- trying to get your attention with the title of this review, I also feel that it is completely true; this movie is incredibly important to me. On my celebrity-related website I have written &quot;rants&quot; in the past about other movies, each for a different  reason: The Blair Witch Project was a great, bold artistic achievement that  changed the way many things were seen in Hollywood. Being John Malkovich  was the most original and enjoyable movie I have seen in a long time.  American Beauty is many things, but above all it is an -important- film.  This isn't your average review; I don't wish to go into too much detail,  except to say that it goes beneath the sometimes inescapably pessimistic  surface of American life and asks us to look far deeper, and it opens our  eyes with both optimism and pessimism--for they are two sides of the same  coin--and tries, tries, TRIES to show us the beauty of our existence and  life and Earth until it is aching from the cellulose of the film it is  printed on. &quot;Look closer&quot; indeed. Look until your eyes hurt and  your heart aches and feels as if it is about to burst with gut-level,  abstract understandings of those unreachable truths behind everything that  always seem to be just beyond our understanding and the true intrigue,  beauty and overwhelming...**(insert the indescribable feeling many of you  will/did experience after watching American Beauty here)** of the Universe  around you that our minds can only begin to piece together. This is  something I look for in many things, and it is absolutely wonderful to see  a movie that seems to share and delve into that feeling.On a  slightly more concrete level American Beauty does something that has needed  to happen for a very, very long time. This IS the tale of the world in  which everyone has and strives for their money, their new car, their  platinum credit cards, their bigger, newer, faster everything. They strive  for the appearance of success and believe that makes everything good. But  they don't have happiness. Yes, that has been done many times in many ways.  But this movie rises above and goes beyond the cynicism of movies about  &quot;real life&quot; of the last several decades and shows us that  although so many of us, SO many of us are living lives of  convenience--cardboard marriages, with our fake jobs and our fake attitudes  about them, with our fake talk to everyone at work and our fake talk to our  fake friends, and our keeping up with a life that we don't WANT because we  think it's how we ought to want it or we're forced into it--it reminds us  that we are -still- here, we are -individuals- and DAMN IT, we don't have  to LIVE that way, we can DO something about it if we want to, we are in a  WORLD with possibilities and beauty and there IS life here around us and  within us and it's been there all along, and if we start being honest with  ourselves we might see all of that. There ARE no walls around us, we can  forgive ourselves for not being perfect and instead see how wonderful we  are and damn it just about EVERYONE is beautiful and interesting  and...-real-. Many things depend on how you look at your world. (Including  your view of American Beauty; many, many people see this movie and simply  come looking for entertainment or whether or not the movie agrees with  their pet issues or whether they think the characters are good and right  and simply do not begin to see it on the level that many others are.) I  hope many of you have come away from this movie or from this page with a  slightly, even a slightly different view of things, a little burning fire  in your soul that makes you want to do...something, I don't know what that  something is for you, or even, or even just look at the world around you a  little -differently-.William Otis, AdministratorThe Rare  Celebrity Nexus	5.0	This is the most important thing I have ever written.	2000-03-28	9	6	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1P3JXTU9JW5P8	William	This movie was my favorite movie along with Braveheart.  The piano theme that played through the movie was very haunting and set the mood for the film very well.  Kevin spacey didn't just get an oscar he earned it.  The  way the theme of lost youth was shown very well but i'm not the person to  be saying what kind of literary themes it had.  If there is somebody that  has broken down the movie and understood the themes please email me.  I  thought one of the most huanting but one of the best parts of the film was  the flying bag, if you haven't watched then you wouldn't know what i'm  talking about.  It was said in another review that that only reason that  certain people didn't like it was because it hit too close to home.

We see him change from a bumbling wimp to a  free spirit.  Annette Beining is also very good as his wife.  Although in  many ways her character is somewhat of a parody of Mary Tyler Moore's in  &quot;Ordinary People.&quot;  There's also fine support from Chris Cooper  as the homophobic neighbor. Alan Ball's script is full of twists and turns  and newcomer Sam Mendes direction gives the film flair. In the end, though  this film is a celebration of life.

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A23IOPI0D1OG7V	"WILLIE A YOUNG II ""willow"""	This film is so close to real life it's almost scary. The rush of emotions one feels when watching Lester Burnham (played to absolute perfection by Kevin Spacey) wander through his life like a suburban zombie is simply devastating. The film was directed by Sam Mendes is such a serene, crystal-clear and precise manner, I can't help but be reminded of the late, great Stanley Kubrick who had a way of making even the most disturbing ideas seem appealing with his use of slow rhythms, dramatic pauses and glaring white light. Annette Bening's Caroline is the perfect shrew, but that tough exterior merely masks her insecurities (witness her brilliant emotional breakdown alone in the den of horrible house she fails to sale. Slapping herself and screaming &quot;shut up you baby&quot; before slipping back into her role as the domineering control freak is fascinating!) The lucious Thora Birch also turns what could have been a one-note character (Janie) into a tour-de-force of of teen angst and isolation. When she finally succumbs to the charms of the quiet,curious and supremely secure boy next door Ricky Fitts (the superb and commanding Wes Bently) the kiss they share is the most tender and affectionate moment in the entire film. Ricky's speech about all the beauty in the world and the way it fills you up is also a classic. This film fills me up and satisfies on so many levels it's difficult to convey in a mere thousand words. I can only say that if you've ever found yourself in a rut, or felt emotionally paralyzed, &quot;American Beauty&quot; will hit close to home. This was a justified winner of the Oscar for best picture. This movie is simply about being human and saving yourself before it's too late.	5.0	Spectacular!	2001-07-07	5	1	4

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A1COQ2DOO1O9HD	Wing J. Flanagan	Pitch-perfect dialogue, amazing performances, solid direction, glowing cinematography - American Beauty has all of these things.  Yet the whole is less than the sum of its parts. It aspires to European complexity while paradoxically wallowing in American sensationalism.  It tries to paint a subtle moral landscape with a gallon of latex semi-gloss and a roller, with lurid supporting characters that could have come from Ricki Lake's green room.By now everyone knows that the story centers on Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), whose life has become an empty, materialistic nightmare with his disrespectful daughter and frigid wife (Annette Benning).  He changes things - a bit too drastically - and ends up becoming a blackmailer, a drug user, and a would-be pedophile.  That he changes his mind at the last minute and doesn't have sex with the teenaged girl, that he ends up martyred because the next-door neighbor thinks (through a bizarre misunderstanding) that he's been taking sexual advantage of his son, that he has some New-Aged revelation about the Circle of Life as he's dying...well, all that's supposed to make him OK.If American Beauty had committed to making Lester either a villain or a hero, it might have worked better.  Instead, it asks us to see him as a flawed, complex man - and forgive him.  That might been possible, had this loopy, creaky, arbitrary series of plot devices not been employed in place of a real story.For every theme explored in American Beauty, better films exist.  Either film version of Lolita, for example, develops the theme of middle-aged crisis coupled with pedophilia far more logically and empathetically, and without resorting to an unconvincing, last minute change of heart to &quot;redeem&quot; the main character.	2.0	Brilliant performances; trite story	2001-05-03	17	10	7

It was overly loved at the time it came out, so I believe there will be a certain amount of the opposite later. And this is  truly undeserved. While it may not be the greatest film of '99 (which the  awards suggest) in practically any other year from the last 10 I would  rarely have agrued. My own personal problem is that while American Beauty  is a great film, it's nothing compared to some of the films from last year.  Now, I love this film. It's the kind of thing Hollywood never does enough.  It is a damn fine film. Spacey is great, Bening has never been better (but  is that so hard?) and Sam Mendes reminds everyone why we should let more  Brits make movies. We've just got far more subtlety and intelligence than  your usual Hollywood director. The script is great, filled with wonderful  dialogue and some great charcters. In fact, I can hardly say anything bad  about his movie. The only thing is that maybe, just maybe, the guy next  door isn't quite a strong enough character. And it's just not as good as  some of the other films which were over-looked in '99. But don't let me put  you off. This film is excellent. Buy it! Watch it! Now!

Although it is well-made and generally sustains interest, it's message is poisonous.The ""hero"" is a teenage drug peddler. He sees artistic beauty in things like a corpse with its brains blown out.A neighborhood gay couple is portrayed as blissful and well-adjusted; by comparison the two heterosexual couples are miserable and dysfunctional. One heterosexual father quits his job during his midlife crisis and starts an affair with a high school cheerleader (!!); the other hetero father is a sadistic control-freak. One heterosexual mother is a materialistic adulterous, the other a zombie. Their kids are lost.It is revealed that the reason the one father is such an abusive hate-monger is because he denied his homosexual tendencies all his life.The overall message of the film rings loud and clear: Embrace homosexuality and you'll be happy, have a normal family and you'll be miserable.If you're a homosexual and want encouragement for your chosen lifestyle, then pick up this flick.

They must really hate it when an almost genre-less film like this comes along and they simply do not know how to classify it or what to write up as the advertising blurb.I was expecting a tale of a teenage femme fetale and her effects on an depressed aging middle-aged male, but also was expecting a sniggering ""black comedy"" as the back of the box had told me.I got neither, but what I did get was the most engaging and intelligent film I have seen for a long while. I do have some sympathies with the advertising men as the film is pretty had to classify. It's not a black comedy and yet there are some genuinely amusing scenes. It's not a tale of a middle class American family and yet it almost solely features the Burnham family and those close to them. I guess the best I can do to describe it is call it a modern day saga of the breakdown of relationships.Every single one of the characters shown has some sort of problem with the way their lives are developing, (apart from the smiley happy gay couple next door.) Lester Burnham is the classic 40 something miserable burned out executive. His wife doesn't love or care for him anymore, she is only concerned that he doesn't embarrass her. His daughter doesn't talk to him anymore and has confessed to her boyfriend she would like him dead. Lester for his own part undermines and belittles his wife at every opportunity, he unashamedly lusts after his daughter's school friend and ridicules and alienates his bosses until they are forced to fire him. Their neighbours, the Fitts, include ex-marine Col Frank Fitts, a stoic military type who forces his son into giving urine samples to test for drug abuse. The son, Ricky, a camera fanatic has taken to filming the local goings on including some dubious footage of the Burnham family. There are plenty more besides this motley selection and it is the quirks and oddities of the characters that makes the film what it is, but at the same time the oddities are ones that we can relate to and maybe even rather scarily see in ourselves. Again for nearly all the characters we can find traits we despise and yet because of failings in other areas we feel sympathy for them at the same time.The performances are to a man extremely accomplished and well executed. Kevin Spacey won a deserved Oscar for his portrayal of Lester Burnham and Annette Bening was also nominated. Their performances and those of the other actors are all played with delicacy, humanity and a great deal of believability.Well recommended and a must see for any fans of the cinema."	5.0	A Beautiful American Film	2006-06-24	4	2	2

Houp ""RAREfiend"""	This being one of my top three all-time favorite movies, I was careful to read the unfavorable reviews on Amazon before I donated my own. The general consensus of those people giving American Beauty 2 stars or lower is that it is &quot;unbelievable.&quot; Generally, these people refer to the characters, the plot, all that composes American Beauty's quirkiness. How do I respond to that?If you found American Beauty &quot;unbelievable,&quot; then the film was a success. This isn't a movie about taking what we've already seen, it's about taking what we've always been afraid to show. The fact that people are shocked by it and have trouble finding the truth in this film means that it has succeeded in all accounts. If you find this film offensive, if you find it too risque, if you find it &quot;unbelievable&quot; then you are the prime reason why it was absolutely necessary that this film be made.American Beauty appears &quot;unbelievable,&quot; I'll admit that; but that is only because we are all so negligent to our own hypocrisy. So many of us REFUSE to relate to Lester, or Caroline, or Angela, even though we secretly know just how dead on their portrayal is. We can say Lester blackmailing his boss is unbelievable, or we can admit that we would have more than a little ambition to do the same when it came our way. We can say that Lester's idealized fantasy with a teenager is unbelievable, or we can look at the mean of male society and understand that most men would have jumped at the opportunity that he had.American Beauty's greatest gift is it's concentration of pure truth. This may be a hard fact for most people to understand and they may deny it to themselves, but keep in mind that with such a diverse selection of characters, humanity can not totally distance itself from EVERY character. Every one holds some internal truth for ever viewer, if they are willing to accept it and not rush to the extremes that classify the whole film as &quot;unbelievable.&quot;This film just makes sense; it had to be made; the fact that it turned out so well is amazing. Every time I watch it, I conclude the viewing with the phrase &quot;you learn something new every time.&quot; And that is the absolute truth. I become more in tune with my own self every time I watch it; I reach an area of my existence that I have never seen before; I understand my motivations with a new and heightened perception. American Beauty doesn't do that by taking vacant stabs in the dark, it does it by showing humanity's most disavowed characteristics, the ones we regret, we deny, we term unbelievable when it applies to ourselves.This film is a classic. Perhaps it will gain a greater mainstream audience with time, but there is no reason we cannot apreciate it now. The image is recent: of turn of the century life in America. This is US, at our best and our worst. If you're not going to believe just how depraved you are, then you have no reason to believe how moral you are. We are a species plagued with both sides of the spectrum. American Beauty is one of the first films to show this. If only people would Look Closer.	5.0	In Response to Bashing of a Great Film	2001-10-21	14	11	3
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A318RKL1I9ABCM	"""zaloop"""	In this story of American angst and family degeneration, Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, father and husband, who hates his job, is getting fed up with his wife, and dislikes his life in general. One day, he snaps. He realizes how empty his life is, quits his job, and ceases to care about anything. He becomes free.First, the acting is among the best dramatic work you'll ever see in a film. Kevin Spacey (one of the best actors in film right now) and Annette Bening have some excellent performances. By now, we know that characters like Lester are the perfect roles for Spacey- cynical, attitudinal, sarcastic. The way he delivers his lines and acts is very impressive: managing to drop the subtlest notes of sarcasm and irony into his voice, being cool yet so acidic at the same time, and injecting his attitude with such cynicism and repressed emotion, he shows in this film why he's one of our best. Likewise, Annette Bening shines and is almost scary in how deeply she seems involved in her character, projecting her hyper uneasiness and the sense that she knows how pointless her life is, yet still tries to hide it.American Beauty discuss the image of the perfect American middle-class family, and the reality of it. In Lester's family and marriage, there is no American beauty. The film makes the case that true &quot;American beauty&quot; is probably not what you think it is- namely, not the seemingly happy family or guy with a nice job. But rather, real Beauty is to be found everywhere in life, if one simply looks for it. Lester snaps because he's intelligent: he realizes that his life holds no meaning for him, he hates his job, and his marriage is fake. Therefore, he quits, not just literally (his job), but figuratively (his former dull life), and tries to reinvigorate his life. He looks for Beauty.Likewise, Wes Bentley's neighbor, who falls in love with Lester's daughter, is an interesting and ironic character- he always looks depressed and dark, and spends his day simply recording mundane events, like a plastic bag floating in the wind. He shows footage of this meek, pathetic bag being tossed around in the wind, to Lester's daughter, because in this he finds Beauty. He is comforted by the idea that all of us, like the bag, are being tossed around in life, but that it's all in God's hands.I must mention how skillfully the film/script handles its teenage characters- they aren't stupid or caricatured, and they don't just mindly hate their parents for no reason, or anything like that. They are given personalities, and credibility (for we see, looking at Lester and his wife, that there may be a very good reason they don't want to be like them).This is part dark comedy and part drama, and I'm glad that, at the point when Lester decides to quit and do whatever he wants to do, it doesn't become a full-blown, cheesy comedy about a guy &quot;letting it all go.&quot; The film could've easily done that and turned into a series of comedy sketches involving Lester doing silly and wacky things with his freedom, but it didn't. (There are some times when it comes close, though.) Instead, it decides to create great drama out of it.This film makes a statement about American life and what it could turn into in extreme cases. It's about gaining freedom from an ugly, empty life, about appearances and the reality behind them. Take Mrs. Burnham. She's a real-estate agent, and she spends days tidying up a house in order to get a sale from someone; and when she doesn't, she breaks down. She's always busy doing something- cleaning, dusting, trimming the flowers, etc.- to keep herself occupied so that she doesn't realize the truth: that her life is empty. She never stops denying it to herself until the exciting climax. Lester, her husband, realizes it sooner; he comes to the conclusion that their marriage is simply an advertisement, a message to the world saying &quot;Hey, look at us, we're married, we're happy!&quot; And ironically, Lester's job (before he quit) was in advertising. Even his neighbor, the homophobic, strict, angry ex-colonel, has something repressed inside him.I must mention the excellent direction and cinematography for this film, which are impressive, from the sweeping pans of the camera to the surreal dream sequences Lester has when fantasizing about his daughter's cheerleader friend (rose petals, which come to symbolize the passion that has left Lester's life, swirl around her whenever he thinks of her).In short, the central theme of this film is &quot;look closer.&quot; If you think you see American beauty in our culture today, or if you think there is no real beauty left in the world today, look closer. Behind the advertisements, behind all the ugliness in this culture and life, look closer to find real American Beauty.	5.0	...look closer.	2000-11-08	17	13	4

0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A306N7X6NHWM92	"ZippyO ""pgsev"""	American Beauty is perhaps the finest assembled film EVER!  It has the rare combination of a perfectly written script, perfect direction, a cast whose acting blends so well together that you truly forget you are watching a movie, rather you feel like you are looking through a window in your neighborhood and watching the lives of others.  When this is all combined with unbelievable lighting and a score that is magical, dream like, and just perfect for the story, well, I must admit, I can not think of a better movie.  This movie is a triumph of film making, as I stated, every role, cast and crew, was filled perfectly.  Starting with a story that Alan Ball wrote, he brought the world the perfect mix of drama, dark humor, irony, depression, and at times, a feeling of triumph.  The story has, hands down, the best character development ever.  As a viewer I truly feel for the characters in this film, and actually can relate to what many of them are going through.  Whether it brought up memories of high school, both good and bad, or feelings of my own current existence as one of the billions on this  planet who is not necessarily content with career choices, or just life choices in general, I can relate.  The musical score, when mixed with repetitive cinematography, such as when Mena Suvari goes to touch Spacey's shoulder in the kitchen, which is replayed three times, it is perfect.  Everything about this movie is perfect, there has never been such a well made movie before, and as I continue to watch the mindless drivel Hollywood loves to throw at us, I can firmly say, there has not been such a well made movie since.  I offer my most sincere thanks to Allan Ball, Sam Mendes, the entire cast and crew of American Beauty for blessing us with the truly perfect example of just how well film translates as a true art form.  If you have never seen this movie, buy it now, and give it time to sink in, it took me a couple viewings before it really set in for me, and now, I simply can not say enough good about it.  This movie is an experience, every single time I watch it, and it just keeps getting better with each viewing.	5.0	It's Never Too Late To Get It Back	2007-11-07	3	2	1
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A3NAQYTKQ5DPIU	zita4	"""Look Closer"", the tagline of Sam Mendes's film, ""American Beauty"" is exactly what you must do in order to enjoy this film. What many people miss is that hidden underneath a series of abstract events and symbols is an entertaining plot. Once you get past the sometimes grotesque situations, it is impossible to stop watching.The exciting plot filled with countless twists and turns in the course of events may be what draws an audience on the surface, but it's the intriguing, thought provoking theme that leaves an audience thinking. The less than star-studded cast including Peter Gallagher and Kevin Spacey takes nothing away from the intellectual nature of the film; it even enforces the generic, nameless image Mendes aims for.""American Beauty"" earned well-deserved recognition by winning five of the eight Academy Awards it was nominated for including best picture. Gallagher also brought home a best actor award and Mendes earned best director honors.The most intriguing aspect of ""American Beauty"" is its courage to tackle such controversial topics as homosexuality, child abuse, divorce, and the monotony of everyday suburbia. Mendes takes a bold approach to many issues that are usually off limits in Hollywood. He pushes the envelope in every area; therefore, he sets new limits for future movies.Like ""A Thin Red Line"" and many other deep, hard-hitting films, voice-over narration provides much needed details and observations. For example, the very first scene includes voice-over where Mr. Burnham foreshadows the ending, but it takes even a careful watcher a few viewings to notice it. ""American Beauty"" is full of hidden things like this and it makes it even more fascinating.Despite all of these brilliant features, the movie does tend to be a bit overly cynical and sometimes pushes reality too far. For instance, it's hardly believable that someone's life could really be as bad as Lester Burnham's.Because it pushes the previous limits in the movies industry, is hard to turn off, and is deep yet understandable, ""American Beauty"" is one of Hollywood's greatest accomplishments in years. It sets the foundation for even more risky films in the future and starts the bar sky high."	4.0	"""American Beauty"""	2006-02-02	0	0	0
0783239408	Belleza Americana  (American Beauty) [VHS]	A23QDK38ODBCZ5	"zoltarsniper ""dstorey65"""	American Beauty is one of the few movies from the nineties that I would consider to be a classic.  It is a movie that will be watched 20, 30, 40 years down the road.  Not only is it's story of self discovery, freedom, and shucking of stereotyped societal roles amazingly well done by a crew of actors that defies reason, but the cinematography, lighting, and directing are all above reproach.  When you think that this is Alan Ball's first cinema script, and that it is Sam Mendes' movie directorial debut, one can only imagine their future.  Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts) is another new comer whose future can only be described as bright.  Combine that with the proven acting genius of Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, and you have an amazing cinematic journey into the dream life of every Tom, Dick, and Harry	5.0	This movie is a cinematic masterpiece	2003-12-11	2	1	1
