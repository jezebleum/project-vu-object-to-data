And I couldnt have cared less if the characters lived or died. Need I say more. I watched this with a female friend and she felt the same way.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ATOFZHQRG29ZK	&#60;ti&#62;won	Okay, first off I would like to say that these oh so referentially hip and ironic types pieces of pop culture fluff are wearing dreadfully thin.  The singing in this film is amateurish, but I could have dealt with that (as I did in &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;.) The visuals are pretty, but they are candy and are ultimately empty images.  The story is a pure drag with terribly slow pacing for having such hyperactive editing techniques.  The acting is truly awful, from all parties involved.  I could not suffer through this turgid movie one more time.  Maybe if you dig on movies like &quot;Shrek&quot; and &quot;10 things I hate about you&quot;, this is your kind of flick.  Or maybe if you like cinematography for it's own sake you will like the stylishness of the shots.  I found this movie aggravating to no end.  Oh, yeah....the arrangements under the singing were awful as well.	1.0	Arrrrggghhh!	2001-12-28	5	2	3
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A19RNG24ZQ19NF	A 12-year old viewer	At first I thought this movie was going to be long and boring about an old night club, but actully it keeps you glued to your seat!I especially like the way that there is alot of variety in it. By that I mean it has singing, dancing, crying, laughing, supence and love. The songs are fabulous. Ewan Mc Greggor and Nicole Kidman have GREAT voices. When you see this movie give it a chance before running into your room. It's a really great movie if you give it a chance. P.S. It's better the second time!My advise to you is to Go see this movie. At the end of this movie you leave with some great things to think about, truth, beauty,freedom and above all things love.	5.0	I absolutly love this movie!	2002-02-22	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AY8UOBI1O11MG	Aaron Orear	The reviewers who slam this pic are soulmates with the film's own character of The Duke - they just can't see beyond the tips of their noses.If you want your movies nice and vanilla, stay away.  If you'd rather see another version of the same old same old, stay away.  If you can't keep two thoughts running in your head at the same time, stay away.Otherwise, welcome to the Moulin Rouge - this year's only Oscar film to actually reinvent the idea of movie making.	5.0	Haters just don't get it...	2002-02-18	6	0	6

Ewan McGregor makes me fall in love with him every time he sings. and those big eyes set fire to my soul.this movie isnt much liked by most people. i dont understand why. its artistic, funny, romantic and tragic. it has become a very important movie in my life. it has a lot of emotional value that you might miss if you dont open your heart to it. and if you miss it then its just a shame.i recomomend popping it in your DVD playing for a romantic evening by candle light.	5.0	best love movie ever!!	2010-07-12	2	1	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AUB9OTKREDWHC	Abby Hart	I absolutely loved Moulin Rouge!  Both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are wonderful!  Because the movie is fast paced, it catches your attention and never lets you lose interest.  It is so elaborate that you find something that you missed every time you watch it!  The costumes and the music are fun and make it a film you can watch over and over. My friends and I certainly have.  The hidden easter eggs in the DVD make it even more fun!

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A4MQ75RMLWTS4	A. Bouardi	This movie is one of the worst you'll ever see.  Unless you love musicals at any cost, this will not only put you to sleep...but you'll have a horrible hangover when you wake up to leave the theater.  The awful singing is only the start...but the pathetic close-ups throughout the film make it almost unbearable to watch.  You keep wanting to stretch your neck back to get some perspective.  The story is pure cliche...right out the butt.  Some silly courtesan finds real love and no longer wants to shell it out for money.  Etc etc.  Nicole Kidman's acting is really bad, as well.  Ewan McGregor is fine, but the role he's given...well...it leaves something to be desired.  The film is banking on the hype created by the Cruise-Kidman divorce along with the prostitute outfits of the Aguilera/Mya/Lil' Kim video.  Blech.	1.0	Not a worse movie this year.	2001-06-02	141	22	119

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A35W9QVDRADEA1	"""acousticsgirl"""	I love the world Baz has created- and I think Ewan McGregor is simply brilliant in this film.  Other than the movie itself- which I do agree is not for everyone- this DVD set is everything I could have hoped for.  The extended dance sequences are wonderful- and the rehearsals are really interesting.  Seeing the dancers doing the same choreography in modern dress, on a soundstage shows you just how magnificient the set design,, lighting and costumes really were.  The commentary is really interesting, and the musical extras are also cool.I can't believe they included the MTV performance of :ady Marmalade- which to me was the least interesting of all the songs in the movie.  I never thought of myself as a Nicole Kidman fan, but I think her look really works- and there are a few goofy scenes where she comes across as very human and real.I will also say that my my brothers and guy friends are movie watchers- but not musical fans- really like this movie as well.  I am more impressed each time I watch it, and I think this DVD set really adds something unique and special to the typical viewing experience.	5.0	I just love this movie!!	2002-01-14	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A49OM9ZPGT3IA	A Customer	There were a couple of times during &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; when I wanted to get up and walk out. There were a couple of other times when I was almost moved to tears. That's the kind of movie &quot;Rouge&quot; is. It throws you for a huge loop. Take Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman (eye and ear candy), throw in some pop, rock and dance music, and add broad brushstrokes of color and rich sound. That's &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot; It's beautiful, vibrant, annoying, cheesy, bombastic, ecstatic, and uplifting all at the same time. And for that, it's definitely worth the price of admission -- and DVD. It's like nothing you've ever seen, and it gets my vote for most original film of the decade.	4.0	It's A Frustrating Flick	2002-03-23	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1C0C9IJO2HS03	A Customer	While the storyline is not entirely original, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are good actors with the vocal talent to make up for it. It's not realistically set in the 1890's, either, but that didn't bother me too much. Good choreography, music, makeup, and costumes, as well. :)	4.0	Quasi-musical is terrific	2002-05-31	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3J6XAPT3HG5E8	A Customer	I love this movie! It is packed full of interesting cinematography you would not expect and amazing music.  It is a bit odd having a musical include another musical inside of it, but this adds to the humor of the film.  The plot is quite predictable and follows a fairly common love scenario, with its own twist on things.  I really enjoy this movie whenever I am looking for a feel good romance with a bit of inappropriate humor in it.	5.0	If you like romance, musicals, and things a little raunchy, then this is the movie for you!	2013-06-22	1	0	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A29QS888W4AXN7	A Customer	"Great direction, visuals, and songs.  ""Moulin Rouge"" is an offbeat, sometimes dark, but charming musical.  The beginning of the movie is somewhat of a visual orgy, but as the movie progresses, audiences are introduced to the growing romance between Satine and Christian.  As they fall deeper in love, their relationship becomes more forbidden accordingly.  Jim Broadbent does a great job as Zidler; his facial expressions are comical and grotesque in an almost paradoxical way.  Emotions are captured onscreen flawlessly.  I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who would be delighted to see Ewan McGregor burst into song on a giant elephant."	5.0	get swept off your feet	2002-07-10	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1B9UU4O3SZ7C6	A Customer	If you've seen the other two films from Baz, Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet, you've got a premise as to what to expect from his films.  His films grow on you.  I recall my first watch of Strictly Ballroom started out with me fidgeting and wondering what the bonkers this rinky dinky Australian flick was about.  By the end I was hooked.Baz likes to use other forms of art to carry his stories, and he uses live, colorful characters to suspend the tale.  In 'Ballroom,' it was ballroom dancing that aided in telling the tale.  In Romeo and Juliet, it was the language of Shakespeare that was the method of storytelling.  In Moulin Rouge, it's song.  Music is truly the language of the heart in this case.To be able to enjoy Moulin Rouge, you have to be able to surrender yourself to suspended disbelief.  You have to realize you're watching something to the likes of a fairy tale.  Where an orthodox method of making a film is to make it as realistic as you possibly can, Moulin Rouge takes the exact opposite approach.  Traditionally, the film should seem so realistic that audiences are easily convinced the story is real and are easily caught up in it.  Moulin Rouge never hides behind any such pretense- the story is fiction and the creators have embraced it as such.Think of Moulin Rouge as an impressionist painting, or impressionist movie, I should say.  What I love about this movie is, like it's predecessor Strictly Ballroom, the story is simple, and the themes are perhaps even innocent and naive.  Yet, it goes to show that even the simplest of stories, as long as they are sincere, can tug and pull at heartstrings just as well as any other movie.Originally, I had intended to give Moulin Rouge only 4 stars, but then I thought about it and changed it to 5.  Nobody has attempted something like this before in mainstream film making, and Baz has only gotten bolder and braver with each movie.The movie is meant to be rushed and maddening.  You're watching what's going on through Christian's (played by Ewan McGregor) eyes.  Everything happens to him in a flurry, so instead of watching the character get swept up in the flurry, the audience gets hit over the head with the rush, as well.  Very brave decision on the director's part.It's an &quot;impressionist movie.&quot;  Just as Picasso's works don't look like anything it was inspired upon in real life, Moulin Rouge is like nothing you've ever seen, but it is everything you've ever felt.  From the lightheaded joy and bliss of first love to the destructive pains of jealousy, and finally loss and heartache, it's everything we've all felt.  Fitting to say, Moulin Rouge is a fine statement of a movie- a statement of the 20th century as a whole, not just the time frame the film was set in.Ewan McGregor plays his character splendidly.  He's every bit the anxious, yearning, sincere and naive young man his character was meant to be.  Nicole Kidman, though not she didn't seem as wide-eyed about love as Ewan's character did, expresses her feelings in a very repressed manner, which I feel is more appropriate for her character considering her situation.  Both their performances are sincere, and Ewan's performance is very, very powerful.  Plus, Moulin Rouge includes a colorful myriad of other characters (played exceptionally well, as well), bursts of songs, and plenty of high powered dancing, none of which ever detract from the plot but add to it.  What's not to like?p.s. Who knew Ewan could sing like that?!	5.0	One of a Kind	2002-02-05	3	2	1

Nicole Kidman shows just how talented an actress she is in this film, her talent for both acting and singing coming through strong.Ewan McGregor also shows his talent in this film, contrasting greatly with Nicole.The film is not to be missed, and i will definately be seeing it again.

You become trapped in the story of the young lovers extremely fast. This is not a movie where you can just get up and go to the kitchen for food, everything is important.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	Moulin Rouge starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is a doomed love story set to classic pop songs. I really wanted to like this colorful musical but I think this film would have been better if the songs were set to an original score, hearing songs I heard a thousand times made watching this film seem silly and pretenious. I don't think Kidman deserved to be nominated for an Oscar, that same year she was absolutely brilliant in The Others so I don't know what all the fuss was about? She's not good here, her singing is ok - nothing spectacular. The Like A Virgin performance is kinda cute but otherwise Moulin Rouge is just average.	2.0	Campy but not in a good way.	2009-06-22	3	1	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3P4JLLM73ETAX	agentdoubl02	I would love for someone to explain to me what all the hype was about. I admit that initially I wanted to see it but during and after my viewing I thought it was quite bland. It was colorful and wild and rambunctious for the first 10 minutes and then it began to center around the same drama for the rest of the time. They can't love each other!! but they do!! but they can't!! but they do!! Oh no! a rich man who's gonna ruin everything. There is one scene I enjoyed earlier in the film when all the characters try to convince the evil villian of the movie that they have made a play. But that scene continued on so long I again became bored. In the beginning the characters were portrayed as very cartoonish and they lost that somewhere along the way. Jim Broadbent I thought was brilliant. I didn't even realize it was him at first. I love John Leguizamo (who until I saw the film I didn't even know was in it), Ewan McGregor, and I suppose I have to say Nicole Kidman. They are all good actors, however this movie I just thought didn't work with them. I never got a feeling for the characters. There was never a time I hoped they would get together or the play would be a success.The only character I felt any emotion for was Jim Broadbent's. I felt he played his character exceptionally well and how it was supposed to be played. Movies are suppose to envoke emotion and this one did nothing for me.Many people credit the director for his creative use of the music. I, my friends, my family and I'm sure millions of other people will relate something in their life to a song and begin to sing that song out loud. I do it everyday. Big deal.I've seen tons of musicals and because of my love for music and cinema, I would have to say Musicals are my favorite genre of films. However the old Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Judy Garland films can never be outdone or remade. When they sang and danced, it seemed as effortless as breathing. They oozed musical theatre, the actors in this film did not.Aside from about 5-10 total minutes of this film, I thought the whole thing was lacking everything needed to make a good film. Perhaps the big names and big lights fooled people into believing this was one of Hollywoods best, it didn't fool me.	1.0	Terribly Uninteresting	2002-06-23	12	7	5
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3AKU3YFXMTROV	"agentfrodo ""agentfrodo"""	i think i understand why so many people hate this movie, there is not much dancing and it seems to be edited in only in fast-motion and slow motion. The fractured songs which aren't originals for the movie also irritates many purists. I would argue that its the evolution of the songbook musicals. The plot and character development may be razor thin and it is the same story Baz has told us twice before but all in all it is a musical. Musicals never have deep characters or interesting plots. Good musicals have entertaining numbers you can hum along too. I think this musical accomplishes what a good musical should, entertain. And it does this in an interesting and new way.	5.0	the future of the musical.	2002-02-21	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1DTCJV6KOMJOA	A*	When I first caught Moulin Rouge in the theatre I was not impressd! The problem was the film felt claustrophobic; In Luhrman's Paris everything was so close chararcter's and key scenes seemed stiff. Amazingly in home viewing the clasutrophobic feeling WORKS! Long gone is the small world feeling its been replaced with a feeling of intimacy with the viewer.  Moulin Rouge at home turns into an affair between two lovestruck misguided fools finding their way with you a riend along for the ride!  Moulin Rouge is a musical that uses modern songs set to a 19th century Paris.  This gives the viewer a sense of comfort and appreciation.  To Luhrman's mistake he seems to reuse the same gimmick over and over again- this being fast editing. At times the camera moves so fast you have no clue where to foucus your attention.  This film is not a masterpiece but it is a work of pure love and it come through for the viewer.  Kidman and McGregor deserve Oscar nominations for their performances here-not the best acting but the most courage to tackle such demanding roles. I have to say the last 40 or so minutes of the film are awe-inspiring.  The costumes and dark atmosphere hold more tension and depth than most traditional films could garner.  Moulin Rouge plays like a comical fable with one of the most dramatic endings ever placed on celluloid.  Kidman's porcelin face and sweat ridden features have more to do with love then any melody that pours out from the disc.	5.0	The Second Time Is The Charm?	2001-12-23	1	1	0

Granted- the premise is hackneyed and the singing isn't as polished as it could be, but let's face it- Nicole Kidman sings better than I do and Macgregor does as well.I would recommend only seing this on DVD so the quality of the movie stays at the highest level.  The colors, the costumes, the makeup- all would be diminished on VHS.  Plus all the extras on the discs are as fantastic as the movie itself.I'd give this 5 stars if I hadn't turned to my husband so many times and said &quot;This is such a WEIRD movie.&quot;  Maybe after I watch it a few more times the fifth star will fall into place.	4.0	It won me over, but still a very WEIRD movie	2001-12-27	0	0	0

Even the people who hate this movie have to love the sequence where &quot;Roxanne&quot; is turned into an erotic Tango!This is the film that brought the musical back to the modern screen, filling a definite void that can not quite be captured by animated Disney movies with songs.  While the story is nothing original (and, actually, neither are most of the songs as they are new arrangements of existing songs), what Baz Luhrmann has does is infuse the excitement of bohemian Paris into the minds and hearts (and tapping feet) of a modern audience.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor turn out incredible performances, but the one who steals the show for me is Jim Broadbent--watch this film and relish in his performance as Harold Ziegler, and then flip to &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; and enjoy his performance as Bridget's dad.Who should watch this?

Are you ready for a modern day musical to dazzle you with great style?  From the very moment this film opens it takes you on a ride.  Imaginatively creative, this film is packed!  Vibrantly alive, the audience was interactive, I heard the positive murmurings during the film.  The sets are gorgeous (the color, the details), almost all the acting was spot-on -- bravo to Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, the story was intriguing, the musical quality was uniquely done (the musical numbers -- a bridge between old and new), and the directing could have been slowed down a tad at the beginning but is the glue.  Not many films like it come around very often.  I do think this is the last film about star crossed lovers I can handle for awhile, but this film provides so much it demands you see it more than once.	5.0	The Baz Triple	2001-06-06	0	0	0

In an age of action and science fiction...it's yesteryear feeling, and transition of classic contemporary songs pulled off this year's most Oscar-worthy film.Ewan McGregor (my new true love) outshines so many of the Hollywood machine players with his sincere and utterly believeable portrayal of Christian.  And Nicole Kidman only improves upon an already spectacular career of daring films.I had never felt so invigorated by a film in so long...I was breathless and anxious throughout, and the music and magic carried me through the film, and out the door as I left the theatre.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A33AFRVRA02BAK	alexliamw	Moulin Rouge is a fantastic film. It is so ridiculous that it is brilliant. To begin with, I worried that it was simply going to be a 'let's make this silly and it'll be called good' kind of film, but it has plot, brains and emotion behind all its glitsy, loud fanfare (and let's face it, there's a lot of that). Good performances from both leads and lots of good individual characters guarenteed to raise a smile.Good singing, with the hilarity of Luhrmann seemingly trying to incorporate every song he ever enjoyed into just a few sequences. Several of these songs are re-interpreted originally and hilarious way (the version of the Police's 'Roxanne' springs to mind).This really is as everyone says a multimedia experience. It's a hilarious but also touching, overblown, clever film in classic Luhrmann style. Excellent.	5.0	Totally overblown, but in the best possible way	2002-09-13	2	2	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3C6X0DAM87GN4	Alex Udvary	"""Moulin Rouge"" is not just the most visually stunning movie I've seen this year, but, it's one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen! To me, visually at least, it's ranks up there with Kubrick's two amazing masterpieces; ""2001:A Space Odyssey"", and ""A Clockwork Orange"", and to mention a more recent film, it's up there with last year's ""Goya In Bordeaux"". This movie to me also, is one the greatest love stories ever told! Comparable to ""classics"" like ""An Affair To Remember"" and recent movies like ""Titanic"". Infact, this movie to me, is a love story of ""TITANIC"" portions! I usually don't give such high credit to more recent films, I save all my appreciation for ""classic"" movies like ""Gone With The Wind"", ""The Godfather"", and ""Casablanca"" to name a few. But, I have to give credit where it's due. ""Moulin Rouge"" I feel is going to be a definate front runner for the Oscar's this year. The directing by Baz Luhrman is wonderful. It carries an almost demonic energy !with it. You can tell this is a movie made by a man of great skill. Everyone it seems has been talking about Luhrman lately. He is a director who is almost sorta starting a ""new wave"" of cinema. He doesn't make his movies they way most Hollywood filmmakers do. The acting between Nicole Kidman (Satine) and Ewan McGregor (Christian) is wonderful. They have certain moments were the both of them seem to play very well of each other. As I've been reading through some other reviews for this movie, it seems many feel McGregor was the highpoint. I have to agree. For as much as I wanted to like Kidman, they was something missing. Everyone has seen the ad's for the movie, well, there's a line in the movie that Kidman says, and it goes along the lines of, she can make herself into whatever men want her to be. That's sorta how I see her performance. You can quite make her out. Which is a shame, because her role could of been a real knockout! There's fine supporting performances by Jim Bro!adbent (Zidler) and Richard Roxburgh (Duke of Monroth) each of whom are very amusing in their roles. But besides the great acting in the movie the real reason to go see this movie is for the unbelieveable effects. The cinematography in this movie is true Oscar material. If it doesn't win an award I will be shocked. The special effects are truly special indeed. ""Moulin Rouge"" is quite no question one of the best films of 2001.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A8U6Y41ZH7K88	Alison	"""Moulin Rouge"", produced, written and directed by Baz Luhrmann, is a tragic love story that encompasses the beliefs of the twentieth century Bohemian revolution. With popular works, such as the 1996 production of ""Romeo &amp; Juliet"" under his belt, Luhrmann has grown artistically and once again used his unique style of popularizing primitive works to illuminate this story. With remarkable detail, choreography, and up beat renditions of popular music, Baz Luhrmann has once again has left his fans satisfied with his new production and eagerly awaiting his next masterpiece.The story of ""Moulin Rouge"" is set in Montmartre, Paris around the turn of the twentieth century. As the Moulin Rouge is a nightclub for gentlemen, it is also a brothel that revolves around the main character Satine (Nicole Kidman) who is the ""Sparkling Diamond"" of the whole production. Satine, apart of an elaborate plot to entice a Duke to invest in the decadent nightclub, accidentally falls in love with the handsome bohemian artist Christian (Ewan McGregor), who writes the theatrical production ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" for Moulin Rouge, who also narrates the story. Satine and Christian become encased in each other and are faced by the challenge of keeping their affair hidden from everybody; which tragically sparks explosive consequences. The two also add unique flair and spirit to the movie through they're amazing vocal abilities that reach out into the audience and grab their attention.Throughout the whole film there are many renditions of popular songs that contribute to the movie's notability; the variety includes many songs, ranging from ""Roxanne"" by Sting to ""I Will Always Love You"" by Whitney Houston. In including elaborate amounts of pop culture, it ultimately reflects the involvement of Luhrmann who regularly popularizes and or modifies older artistic works. The music in this movie will capture the audience and almost force them to sing along, as the aura created by the soundtrack of this film is one of complete glee. Contrasting with the heart wrenching story line of the film, the soundtrack is very well comprised and illuminates the amazing detail in every aspect of this film.As the movie begins, the audience will be bewildered by the strong effects and immaculate detail, which will play a very important role in the identity of this movie. If you have happened to stumble upon the Luhrmann version of ""Romeo &amp; Juliet"" you will recognize the director's rare style which prevails through obsessive detail in absolutely everything. This happens to be highly evident with in ""Moulin Rouge"", down to the last bit of lace on the can-can skirts to the sparks when Satine and Christian kiss for the first time, Mr. Luhrmann has out done himself obsessing over every tiny detail once again.From the gifted producer Baz Luhrmann, ""Moulin Rouge"", a tragic love story about a courtesan and a bohemian artist, is truly a piece of art. In my opinion, it should be shelved in the rental store along side the renowned musicals such as, ""The Sound of Music"", ""Grease"", ""The Little Shop of Horrors"", and ""West Side Story"", as I believe it will be considered a classic musical in future generations. With the combination of its dazzling artistic and articulate detail, a mind-blowing soundtrack, a brilliant story line, perfectly selected cast, amazing choreography, and an overall sparkling aura, this movie truly can be called ""spectacular spectacular."""	5.0	Moulin Rouge is Truly &#65533;Spectacular, Spectacular!&#65533;	2003-01-22	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A15RWISQPP8MUG	All American Cutie	A super-imaginative romp through the Bohemian underground of 1900's Paris.The story loosely follows the plot of LaBoheme. Doomed lovers, a jealous Duke and, of course, the famous eye candy of the Moulin Rouge itself entwine to create a riveting story.Unlike musicals of the past, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; uses the music to tell the story, rather than stopping the story and breaking into song. Yes, the music is modern and done in a &quot;cheesy&quot;, tongue-in-cheek manner, but it all works together to entrance and captivate the audience. A gritty, gravelly version of &quot;Roxanne&quot; (by The Police) is done to an intense Argentinian Tango. WOW!  Amazing! The acting and singing are top notch!This is one movie you will either completely love and want to see again and again or it will make you want to leave the theater early (or shut off your DVD player!).

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1G6X1YXA9LIMA	"""altera-a"""	&quot;Camille&quot; musicalized for the DVD era, this post disco potpourri is a flamboyant, kinetic rollercoaster, that features an idealized, anachronistic vision of 1900's Paris, with an explosive musical soundtrack of this turn-of the century (with incredible versions of hit songs of Elton John, Madonna, Queen and even Nirvana, among others).Bazz Luhrman's over-the-top, entertaining and emotionally overpowering masterpiece is definitely an improvement from his Romeo + Juliet, if it's certainly not-for-all tastes. Even to devotees of classic musicals, Moulin Rouge won't be specially satisfying, but if you are a real musical fan, you know that it's always been a genre that constantly break its own rules.Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor make a wonderful pair (and they both sing quite well!).	5.0	Potpourri on Parade	2003-04-03	4	1	3
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A15S44J4NHU4LS	"Alvin Tanhehco ""kerki"""	I intended the title of this review to be a play on the 4 Cs of a diamond (cut, color, clarity, carat).  Indeed, this is a gem of a film.  I thought it was an ingenious way of reinventing the modern day musical.  I further appreciated the film after seeing the making of it in the Special Features section.This film is about a penniless writer, Christian, that falls in love with a courtesan named Satine.  But Satine has responsibilities to her boss Zidler and benefactor the Duke.  This is how the love triangle is set up.  Look past the fact that the plot is quite cliche and simple.  Once you see that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor do have on-screen chemistry and can actually sing, you'll be amazed.This DVD set comes with 2 discs.  The first disc contains the movie as well as a behind the scenes option that allows you to look behind the scenes for certain sequences in the film.  The second disc contains everything but the kitchen sink.  It has interviews with the cast, the making of the music, the making of the sets, still images by professional photographers of the making of the movie, a scrap book of the story, complete/extended/multi-cam featurettes of the major dance sequences in the film (like the can can, tango, coup d'etat, hindi, etc.), music videos of the Lady Marmalade song.It took me a full 8 hrs. to go through all the material and I never felt bored.  Baz terms this film as the conclusion of a trilogy of red curtain movies, after Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet.  I have yet to see Strictly Ballroom, but I have no doubt that Baz Luhrmann's talent for story telling will leave me mesmerized as well.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 4 (all the major dialogues are in the form of songs from the 80's)E (Erotica) - 2 (surprisingly it was sexy in a humorous, light way)A (Action) - 0 (n/a)P (Plot) - 3 (it is a cliche plot, but well told nonethless)	5.0	Dazzling colors, costumes, chorus, cinematography...	2002-04-29	4	3	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3BHN5BGICORAW	A Main	As soon as Nicole Kidman starts belting out Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend [she actually sings quite good!], you know she deserves at least an oscar nomination ! If better, the actual award itself! With her performance in The Others aswell as this great movie, she leaves all those visions of Mrs Tom Cruise far behind her. Her career will not rot away like another certain divorce [namely Bruce and....well Demi Moore].A naive poet named Christian [EWAN MCGREGOR] arrives in the town of Montmartre in 1899 to become part of the Bohemian Revolution! He accidently takes part in a modern play called Spectacular Spectacular which just happens to be involved with a certain  Toulouse Lautrec [A delightfully campy John Leguizamo].Impressed by his performance, Toulouse and co. take him to the Moulin Rouge to 'audition' for a beautiful courtesan named Satine [our Nicole]. She mistakes him for a slightly gay 'Duke' [Richard Roxburgh] and they instantly fall in love admist flashy can-can courtesans and under the watchful eye of Harold Zidler [Jim Broadbent]. But their love cannot last forever so will they face up to reality or keep their love alive till SHOWTIME....If I had to be picky, I would say that Moulin Rouge was a tad overlong and it had too many characters that just weren't interesting enough....Harold Zidler and The Duke being two. Yet who REALLY can pick out faults in such a beautiful movie?? The set designs and all [yes ALL] the songs were near perfect. Miss Nicole Kidman will be around for VERY long time...

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3IVZV4GLD9QL7	Amanda	After I first saw it 3 weeks ago, Moulin Rouge continued to linger in my mind. How can you forget all of the incredible music, colour, story, dancing, fun, and love in this film? I got the soundtrack and listened to it over and over again until I simply could not stand it anymore: I had to see Moulin Rouge one more time in the theater. So yesterday I went to see it again- and I can honestly say it was even better the second time!!! I noticed things that I had not seen before, like the use of colour in the movie (blue, white, and red,) the constant references to the movie's themes: Truth, Freedom, Beauty, and Love, and so much more. Seeing it a second time allowed me to focus more on the acting and songs and overall visuals used in the movie instead of trying to keep up with the fast- paced story like you are forced to the first time around. It gave me a whole new appreciation for the movie. I probably won't see it again in the theater- mostly because it's a long drive from my house to the theater that it's playing at! By I certainly cannot wait until it comes out on DVD. Moulin Rouge is definitely the best movie of the summer so please, please don't miss it!	5.0	Even better the second time!	2001-06-29	2	2	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AGF3UUIXWPBLO	"Amazon Customer ""felldragon"""	I went into the movie theatre not knowing what to expect from Moulin Rouge.  The reviews that I had heard of it were anything but complimentary, but I was intrigued by the resurgence of a musical.I was utterly astounded after watching the movie!  The plot was simple and sometimes easy to predict.  But Baz Louhrman outdid himself.  What the plot lacked the music more than made up for.  Taking pop music and reorchestrating it, Louhrman created a device that works to carry the emotions of the characters far better than any dialogue ever could.  Especially fantastic was the use of Queen's &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; and Christian and Satine's duet &quot;Come What May&quot;!My girlfriend said it best as we walked out of the theatre, &quot;At first I wondered what you had gotten us into, but that was an amazing movie!&quot;	5.0	Amazing...Was Dazzled by the Music	2001-07-04	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2Q8W8EZV90NV0	Amazon Customer	I just got back from seeing this movie at the theatre and I can't put into words how good it is.  If you don't like musicals, you shouldn't go see this--it is very much a modern day musical.  Nicole Kidman proves to be a magician of many tricks once again.  Her talent is heightened to a new level.  Ewan McGregor shines very brightly, even in the light of Ms. Kidman.  He is gorgeous and talented, all in one.  They both have extremely pleasant voices to listen to.  All in all, everything was awesome, to say the least.  Be ready for continual business on the screen-- your eyes really don't get a break throughout the movie.  The plot moved along nicely, not lacking for anything, not dragging.  I didn't once look at my watch, like I do in many recent movies.  As soon as this comes out to pre-order, I'll be ordering it!

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1XBMS6MN8X5JX	"Amazon Customer ""mark_cohen"""	I've always felt that &quot;The Matrix&quot; was the ultimate DVD to show off the features of this relatively new home video format to friends who you were trying to lure into the world of DVD. Not anymore.Let's start of with the first disc. Brilliant video and audio transfer of the film itself. Two separate, highly educational commentary tracks. A special English audio track, for the visually impaired, which gives full descriptions of  the on-screen occurrences other than the dialogue. A &quot;Follow the Green Fairy&quot; feature where you can click on the fairy which appears at the bottom left of your screen at various points in the film, to take a quick peek at some scene-specific production footage, intelligently explained by specific members of the crew.The second disc is even more of a collector's dream. The deleted/alternate versions of scenes actually contain notes on which draft of the film they appeared in. The cast list doesn't contain the usual credits and brief biography that you usually see on DVDs - you get short featurettes with interviews of the stars where they talk about the experience of making the film, with on-topic clips interspersed throughout. In the &quot;Dance&quot; segment of the disc, you get extended versions of the production numbers in the film. Three of these actually allow you to shift the camera angle of the film, from four different continuous shots. To make selection easier, the alternate shots, running in sync, appear in smaller windows beneath the letterboxed main image you've selected.When you click on the &quot;Music&quot; section, you'd expect videos for the two most popular songs from the film, but you actually get several bonuses - the live performance of Lady Marmalade from the MTV Movie Awards, a featurette, and even an interview with Fatboy Slim.Even the &quot;Marketing&quot; segment contains more than the usual stills, posters and trailers. You actually get a montage of clips from the various TV programs the film was featured on, from Network TV to E! and more.All this, and I haven't even gone through the entire package. That will take days, possibly even weeks! The only thing that seems to be missing is the shooting script - or maybe I just haven't found it.This is a MUST for any DVD Collection.	5.0	Move over, &quot;Matrix&quot;!	2001-12-04	10	9	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1GUP4VO5AOVHZ	"Amazon Customer ""movie maven"""	Moulin Rouge is the type of movie you may need to see more than once. It's not that it's a complicated story  - in fact, it's so wispy as to almost be blown away by the rush (and I do mean rush) of visual spectacles.  By the time the shock of the lightning-paced blur wears off, the movie is half over -- and by then it starts to slow down its visually madcap pace. No kidding, I can picture people wanting to go to this movie in an altered state -- the way my dorm pals did at midnight screenings when I was in college. The swirling, almost non-stop visual kaleidoscope starts almost at minute one and doesn't let up for a full hour. Really, most of the movie dances by in a blur. While many in the audience chuckled in recognition of the familiar (mostly) pop tunes, the songs were expertly arranged, orchestrated and staged. Ewan McGregor really shines -- and can really sing! Jim Broadbent, a terrific English character actor, is unbelievable (sort of a new-millenium PT Barnum perhaps?). He has one number in particular... but I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.  (Let's just say that I'll never think about a certain Madonna song in the same way again.)  I'm not exactly sure what Baz Luhrmann was thinking while directing John Leguizamo as Henri de Toulouse Lautrec (maybe by way of The Time Bandits and Monty Python?) but I'm not exactly sure it matters. Nicole Kidman has a perfectly OK, if thin, voice that I'm sure was majorly boosted in post production (and/or the recording studio) but she's not bad -- she just technically doesn't have a lot to work with. If you've seen and liked Strictly Ballroom, just think of the version Baz might have created on acid -- and you still won't come close to the audio and visual roller-coaster that is Moulin Rouge. You may love it. You may hate it. But you should certainly dance off and see it.	4.0	The Musical Acid-Trip Called Moulin Rouge	2001-05-19	45	37	8

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2R4LM60ZHIDIF	Amber Dowd	Being a lover of musicals, I felt compelled to see this movie as soon as possible, not believing my eyes and ears when I heard that a musical love tragedy was hitting the big screen.  What I witnessed was blasphemy against some great classic hits that should have remained just that: classic, grouped with a handful of not-so-classic songs that should have never been unearthed.  They were all twisted into a ridiculous and unbelievable array of visual lavishness (which, I admit, was pleasing to the eye if you have a penchant for Luhrmann's dazzling directing style).  The beauty of the explosively colorful sets was soured as I lost count of how many times I audibly groaned at the cheesy covers of once original songs.  The movie was visually stunning thanks to Luhrmann's imaginative eye for the fantastic, but the script was painfully unoriginal, and the characters were ridiculously embellished walking stereotypes (or crawling...see Kidman in the faux duke seduction scene).  I felt embarrassed for the actors and monetary supporters behind this overdone, overhyped, and overrated mocking tale of sugary passion.  The love story or &quot;plot&quot; (which was as transparent as Kidman's complexion) was over before it began with a stale flashback format and events as predictable as each new cheesy cover song.  The onslaught of badness left a Nutrasweet residue in my mouth the rest of the weekend that's still with me today as I write this review.  Moulin Rouge is the worst of new era Disney and the very worst of contemporary Broadway combined into a colorful nightmare that will haunt any viewer with an inkling of artistic ethics.  If you're longing for pure eye candy with little substance, then see the movie.  It is worth a look solely for the visual circus Luhrmann leads us through, but I'd recommend renting or buying the DVD down the road, kicking back with your favorite cocktail or hallucinogen, and firmly pressing the MUTE button before the movie begins.	2.0	Ridiculous!

DVD seems to have been invented for Moulin Rouge-- capturing the precision of the dance choreography, the drama in the lyrics and finally giving the scene selection feature a useful purpose.  If you love musical romance you'll likely love it.  If you've never seen this unique film you may want to rent it before buying.  Some viewers are unhappily surprised by the modern music and exaggerated operatic style of the film, which is evident from the very first scene. In my opinion they just need to watch it more.  All the melodrama, strange characters, and surreal staging do come together when considered as a whole and the more times you watch it, the more you'll realize how perfectly.  Not only is the music memorable but the story, a classic love triangle tragedy, holds up extraordinarily well.  One can analyze the director's choices and characters' motives at length. Who is ultimately responsible for the love triangle Harold Ziddler or the lisping Duke? Which is better idealism or realism? Unlike most musicals films, Moulin Rouge covers many angles.	5.0	A truly unique and modern musical romance	2002-08-13	2	2	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3L5NQ96H2L8RR	a movie lover	Happy to see that there are still people writing opinions on this movie though this is not a latest  one. Actually this film was first shown at cinemas here two years ago.  The shots chosen as promotion ad on tv made me feel it's just a movie packed with glamour costumes and dancers and I was misguided into thinking that it's not worth seeing so I ignored it.A couple of weeks ago,I spotted a moulin rouge vcd among other 'old movies' on a shelf at Blockbuster. I rented it as a 'late night show' that night.  Without great expectation, I sat back and started watching it. Since the beginning of the film, I had been attracted to it as the camera swooped across Paris in black and white, backed up with the opening song 'nature boy' (I didn't know what the song was at that moment yet). Wow, the melody fitted the tone of the movie perfectly.  Then it appeared Christian, who started to retell his story... I sat in my armchair, became more and more absorbed in the songs, the acting, the entire movie.  I kept sitting there for a few moments longer, thinking over all that had happened as the credits were rolling on the screen at the end of the movie, which I'd never done before. You know, more often you'll just switch it off right after a movie ends.  It's really a surprise to me.The rearrangement of old songs was superb. Together with the songs in the movie, Nicole, Ewan and other supporting roles help to boost the movie up to the best of the best. Not to mention, the director did a great job.  Nicole is a wonderful actress and I like her previous movies such as 'To die for' and 'The others&quot; and she was the main reason for me to see 'Moulin Rouge'.  But this is Ewan who steals the movie.  I'd never seen a single movie of his before.  I'm mesmerized by his charm and voice. He's really a talented actor. As quoted from an interview with the director before the movie was shown on screen, Baz said that Ewan was his 'secret weapon' in the movie, I'm sure that the movie has won thousands of hearts through this weapon. My husband said he would watch it once again though he thinks it's a kind of 'women's film.  I'm not a keen writer and I don't know how to describe how good the film is. it's just fantastic to me and that's it!I returned the vcd the next day but at the same time, I bought a vcd. Then I went to HMV for a dvd version the next week. I have an impulse to watch the movie every day and listening to the &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; soundtrack has now become my favourite pastime.	5.0	Moulin Rouge, an awesome movie	2003-08-14	3	2	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A928WN8NV03WZ	"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy"""	I give this two stars for some of the cinematography and the costumes.  But in every other way this movie is a mess.  Grossly overdone in the tradition of Natural Born Killers, a movie that gave new meaning to the cliche&quot;sometimes less is more&quot;.  I did want to like this movie, but it was far too chaotic and bloated.  Makes me wonder what the director is like in person.  plus I was dissapointed that this was supposed to be a musical and very little of the music was original, mostly covers of pop music.  The visuals though interesting at times jumped from one idea to another too quickly making me dizzy.  The main characters were also a bit vapid, even for protagonists in a love story.	2.0	my head will explode	2003-12-10	9	6	3
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A35RGVR36I8D45	Amy	Baz Luhrmann is the mad genius who brings Moulin Rouge together. The visual artistry, which at times can be overwhelming, is used very effectively to create a fantasy world in which an otherwise simple story is given a breath of freah air.Although this movie is one of my favorites from 2001, it is not for everybody. The first 15-20 minutes alone are enough to give some people a headache because of the fast editing and swirling camera movement. However, those first minutes do a good job of setting the pace of the Moulin Rouge so that when the pace of the film slows down, the audience is ready for the love story.Nicole Kidman is absolutely first rate as Satine, the courtesan. She has to run the gamut from tacky, silly, to crying and dying. It may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate what a well rounded performance she gives. And, she can more than hold her own in the singing department. Ewan McGregor is also very good as Christian, the poet who loves Satine. It is hard to imagine any other actor in the role. He and Kidman have a great onscreen chemistry (it's obvious from interviews they enjoyed working together). His soulful poet is at times brash and confident and at other times a scared little boy--he is the stabilizing center of the story. Oh, and he sings nice too. The supporting actors, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh play their roles to the hilt and are both very good.Overall I would recommend Moulin Rouge to anyone who enjoys film as an art or anyone who likes a nice love story. You get both with Luhrmann's creative genius at the helm.	5.0	Mad Genius	2001-12-30	0	0	0

Just when I had lost faith in Hollywood, Baz Luhrmann puts out this masterpiece that epitomizes creativity and talent.  I avoided seeing this movie until recently, and I regret that I never saw it at the theater.  Ewan McGregor's performance will leave you breathless and Nicole Kidman will make even the harshest critic rethink old perceptions.  The soundtrack is amazing, second only to the choreography!  This movie has quickly become one of my favorites, as it combines comedy with drama so seamlessly.  Watch this movie with an open mind and you will be dazzled by a soon to be classic love story!	5.0	Best movie of the year!	2002-01-30	1	1	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2CIARWVPEDH0Z	An 11-year old customer	I really found this movie amusing as far as visual effects and costume design. The music is recycled, as anyone can tell, but is used well and doesn't overpower the story. There are some funny moments, and for those of you sesitive ones out there, it can be quite a tearjerker approaching the end. The only annoying part is the fact that the writers, apparantly, couldn't decide what type of film to write...it isn't entirely a romance or entirely a comedic spoof. Perhaps, however, this is what makes the movie all the more interesting.	5.0	Moulin Rouge is a Musical Triumph	2001-12-27	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1JMGB1UWMW0X2	Andrea Affleck	The Moulin Rouge was a nightclub in Montmartre, France outside of Paris. The story is set in the summer of 1899 and continues until 1900. The coreography in this movie is accentuated brilliantly by the excellent costumes that were designed by Catherine Martin.Before this movie, I thought Nicole Kidman was a joke who needed Tom in order to be worth anything- now I see how wrong I was. she came into her own beginning with this movie. Baz Luhrmann's capivating and innovative style plays a major role in this eccentric and lovable movie. Ewan Mc Gregor and Nicole Kidman's voices are astoundingly good and just for the record I recommend the soundtrack as well. The story itself is relatively simple- it is just a story about Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love. Ewan Mc Gregor's portrayal of Christian, the love-struck penniless writer, is absolutely flawless and believable. Richard Roxburgh is absolutely perfect as the overly possesive Duke who desires Satine for himself. Jim Broadbent dazzles as Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge. John Leguizamo as the &quot;vice-ridden gnome&quot; Toulouse is genuine as well- I especially like the scenes as the magical sitar. The acting in this movie is what makes it worthwhile.Moulin Rouge is a simple love story told through song. I sincerely recommend it to every person who loves musicals- and even those who don't. The movie boasts music ranging from Nirvana to Elton John to Madonna- it's a sure fire for anyone who has ever listened to music in their life.Moulin Rouge is not for everyone however. The first time I saw Moulin Rouge- I absolutely hated it. Now I've seen it 7 times and I cry each time (this is the first movie I've ever cried in). I urge you to see it again and give it another chance even if yuo despise it- it's definately worth seeing.	5.0	Spectacular, Spectacular!	2002-03-28	1	1	0

This is an amazing movie, I heard of it at school and was like, ""Oh, that movie that had that ugly Christina Agulaira music video, no thanks,"" so much buzz made me rent it. I saw it the first time and was a little out of the loop afterwards, I mean this was a weird idea of a modern-day musical, and kinda freaky, so I had to watch it again,and then again and about 5 times more. Its amazing love-story fitted with a wonderful plot and music that you already know before you see it it is the perfect combination for another Baz Lurhman masterpiece. If you just want to see if you'll like it just watch the song 'Roxanne' and you''ll see when you can't for the life of you get it out of your head.It is definently addictive, and if you like Chicago, or even if you don't, or if you like anything of Baz, Romeo + Juliet, Strictly Ballroom and soon to be Alexander the Great, then this is a must watch since it is an infiniti times better!!!"	5.0	Dont Have It?

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	People hate this movie; I mean really, really loathe it.  You know what the funny thing is?  I totally understand.  `Moulin Rouge!' is hardly a film for everyone.  It claims to be a revival of sorts for the musical genre (and it was) but it is really far removed from anything the genre has ever seen before.  Baz Luhrmann is an acquired taste, a man full of vision (one of our generation's greatest auteur) and that vision, no matter how grand, doesn't translate for everyone.  With buckets of style lavishly emptied on every frame, there are many detractors who view Luhrmann's `simple plot meets overtly dramatized delivery' to be distracting to put it nicely.This is a `busy' movie.For every ten or so people who despise this film and consider it an overrated disaster, there is one person who absolutely adores it and relishes in all of its haphazard and chaotic magnificence.Yes, `Moulin Rouge!' is a simple film, plot-wise.  You have a writer, Christian, who falls in love with a woman of the night, Satine, only to be pretty much banned from her affections by her boss who has promised her to a wealthy man, The Duke.  Stealing time together, the two work on a massive production in The Duke's honor, but there is a dark secret (a predictable one really) that may prevent Satine and Christian from ever really being `together'.That's it; but it's how it is strung together that makes all the difference.`Moulin Rouge!' for me is one of those rare films where everything comes together just right.  The singing is spectacular (especially Ewan McGregor, who can really, REALLY sing), the acting is tremendous (especially Jim Broadbent, who won the Oscar that year for the WRONG film) and the sequences are dazzling (especially thanks to Nicole Kidman, who has never been so beautiful).  The sets are brilliantly constructed and add so much vibrancy and emotional weight to the scenes.  The musical numbers may be all over the place, spliced together with attention deficiency in mind, but they work in harmony with Luhrmann's vision.  Really, if you are familiar with his work (`Strictly Ballroom' and `Romeo + Juliet') then you know how he develops his visual opus, and this is no different.  This is Luhrmann at his most creative and engaging (even if I slightly prefer `Romeo + Juliet' as a whole).So, hopefully, if you haven't yet, you will give this one a try.  If you hate it, I understand, for it has qualities that cannot be appreciated by everyone; but if you're lucky you'll see something here that is rarely seen in cinema, and that alone is worth the price of admission.Besides, this is one of the most debatable and thus the most interesting films in recent cinema.	5.0	A major triumph for cinema...	2009-10-09	4	4	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1R35S8UERTQQ4	Andrew G. Hunter	Coming from a broad history of musicals and stage acting, I went in expecting much from Moulin Rouge and came out with my expectations shattered and my views of music, movies and everything in between changed forever.  Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet impressed me but Moulin Rouge blew me away like no movie I have seen before or since.  It's scope, acting, music, and beauty (yes, beauty) is breathtaking.  By the way, Ewan MacGregor should be on broadway because his voice is absurdly good.  Nicole Kidman, while lacking the punch of Ewan MacGregor, is excellent as well.  This movie also has an incredible range of emotion displayed.  I laughed out loud one moment and cried like a baby the next.  It's the best movie I've seen all year, bar none.  Go buy it.  Now.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3HEOFB17CJPK1	"Andrew L. Caswell ""Drew Caswell"""	Wow! A whirlwind of colour and sound, intermixed with exceedingly clever contempory musical cliches, outrageously funny in parts, romantic, yet tragic. Baz Luhrman has gone where no other has with a musical. Luhrman's characteristic use of colour, sound, music and perspective is evident for those who have seen other films he has directed, such as 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo and Juliet'. Nicole Kidman's portrayal of the stunning 'night-club' performer 'Satine', searching for true love, but caught in the underworld lifestyle of the Moulin Rouge, is fantastic. While Ewan McGregor's performance as 'Christian', a writer trying to discover what love is, who is inadvertently drawn into the world of Moulin Rouge, is tremendous. Performances by Richard Roxburgh as 'Duke of Worcester', Jim Broadbent as 'Zidler', John Leguizamo as 'Toulouse Lautrec' and Jacek Koman as 'The Unconscious Argentinian' were equally magnificent. Moulin Rouge is SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR! A must see...even if you don't like musicals.	4.0	Spectacular, Spectacular!	2001-06-02	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2I0LBDI2Y6CJ5	Andrew Leif	The reviewers who dissect the film looking for Buddhist symbolism are surprisingly on point and correct about the assertions they make, I think. My only qualm is that I am not so sure mantras is the best way to think about the songs. Buddhism has a rich tradition of poetry devoted to teaching the middle path even through tantra.

It's perfect for those of us who remember watching old musicals with our parents (or you were the parents) and have wondered for years why they weren't made any more. Plus it's so lush-the colors, the fabrics, the whole feel (yes, very Bohemian in a way).

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3QNDC8R01FP3H	"""andysworc"""	Moulin Rouge (I have the Special Edition released in Australia on Dec 5, 2001) is one of the most superbly presented DVD/Videos I have ever seen. In Stictly Ballroom Director Luhrmann used Dance to tell his story, in Romeo and Juliet he used Language and now in Moulin Rouge he uses song. Featuring versions of Lady Marmalade, Your Song, Children of the Revolution as well as Roxanne (Police) which is a rough/gutsy tango version you have to hear to truly appreciate. You enter a world where the dialogue and the song become one, which then combine with costumes, colour and specatcle to create a unique and original landmark production. This is not your normal film - this film has opened new doors. This is especially a film for lovers of Music Theatre and Dance and I understand auditions are currently underway for the Stage Production of Moulin Rouge.  Special features include documentaries, interviews, narration for the visually impaired and you can do your own live vision mixing with multi angle scenes with the three most elaborate dance sequences - the Can-Can, Tango and Coup d'Etat. Obviously the best place to view this film is on the big screen which gives the feel of being in a theatre, but this is a great compromise and the more you watch it the more you recieve from it.  Value for money - yes yes yes.	5.0	Moulin Rouge  - &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot;	2001-12-24	6	6	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3C37W8WGMV8UQ	Angela Dalecki	Moulin Rouge is probably my favorite movie of the last ten years, and it's definitely in the running for my favorite movie ever.Baz Luhrmann revolutionized the movie musical with this film, and I firmly believe that Chicago (and, to a lesser extent, The Phantom of the Opera) owes its success to this movie.  I love movie musicals, but they're usually horribly cheesy because they're a direct adaptation from stage to film, and the two mediums are not interchangable.  On stage, you can go from talking to singing and dancing, and the audience goes along with that because they expect it.  The sets and costumes combined with the live audience remind us that it's not real, and so we can accept the spectacle of song and dance.  The problem with most movie musicals (West Side Story is a prime example of this) is that the film goes from a straight scene and dialogue to singing and dancing, and it's a huge jolt for the audience.  Throw in a more realistic set than you'd get on stage (such as the streets of New York), and it's impossible to expect the audience to suspend their disbelief.But with Moulin Rouge Baz Luhrmann created a surreal, larger-than-life, heightened reality where characters can break out into song and dance and the audience members won't bat an eye.  Through fast camera cuts, outlandish costumes, computer-generated animations (like the singing moon), and luscious sets, Luhrmann reminds us at every turn that this isn't real--and to just sit back and enjoy the ride.The casting for this movie was brilliant.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman play the star-crossed lovers Christian and Satine, and they do all their own singing--and they're better than you'd expect.  (McGregor, especially, has a surprisingly hauting, powerful voice.  The movie is worth watching for his performance alone.)  Richard Roxburgh is marvelous (and often overlooked) as the sniveling, rat-faced Duke who wants to keep Satine for himself.  The cast is rounded out by Jim Broadbent, who plays the larger-than-life manager of the Moulin Rouge, and John Leguizamo, who plays Christian's friend Toulouse-Letrec.This 2-disc DVD is packed with tons of bonus features, including two commentaries, interviews with the cast, documentaries, and uncut footage of the dance El Tango de Roxanne.  It's definitely worth picking up if you liked this movie.This film is, to put it simply, pure art.  Stunning visuals and fantastic performances abound, and there's so much to see that you'll catch something new every time.  I highly, highly recommend it.	5.0	A truly ground-breaking masterpiece full of eye candy...	2005-05-31	6	5	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3FERT4E8SBFQJ	Anime Master	Moulin Rouge is nothing short of spectacular. With some of the finest costumes, cinematography, and art direction ever to be seen. The film is directed by Baz Luhrmann whom also directed the 1996 version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;brings his gift sense of style to this movie. This is not to mention a wonderful musical score which blends contemporary hits in a traditional musical style of presentation. The only flaw in this gem is the first ten minutes of the movie, which I did not know if I was watching a comedy or a serious drama. Yet once I found my self inside the Moulin Rouge I found that this was a heart warming romance, and a tragic drama. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman give there best preformances in this film, even if the majority of there lines are present though music much in the style of &quot;Evita&quot;. The story of a young man whom goes to Paris to write a story of his ideals of truth, beauty, freedom and above all love leads him to a group of eccentric artists which ask him to write a play for them. This allows our main character the chance to meet the beautifull dancer Satine, whom is the main star of the Moulin Rouge and a prostitute. Yet there love is over shadowed by a jealous and insane duke whom holds the deed to the Moulin Rouge and there very lives. The film is rated PG-13 yet this movie should have been rated R for the strong sexuality, violence language and mature themes which include a scene of rape. This film is suggested for those sixteen and up, anyone under should truely view this film with their parents. For anyone looking for a wonderful musical, even if unconventional, and a good romance then this is your ticket to world of forbidden pleasures.

At times the film was like a trip back to the acid-tripping 70s. Weird.  Moments of greatness mixed with tediously dizzying camera work. If you love Nicole Kidman, you'll love it. She's beautiful and charming. As Satine, she sings quite well,(sounding something like Helen Reddy)even though she's in the throes of TB. Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo were engaging and quite believable.Generally, a strange creative attempt.

The movie starts fast and is hard to catch onto at first, but the hyperactive dance scenes and speedy dialogue do nothing except make you want to glue your eyes to the television screen at all costs.  I highly suggest this movie to anyone who is bored of the same ol' mindless action films or predictable chick flicks.  It's one of the best movies of the year.	5.0	One of the most underrated movies of the year	2001-12-19	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2IZJ1BYDVNGE2	"Annette Gisby ""agisby"""	This is a film that you will either love or hate. I loved it, watched it more times than I will admit to in the cinema, and have since bought the special edition DVD, with a host of extras, such as interviews with the stars and extended dance sequences, as well as deleted scenes from the original film release.The film iteself is different to any musical you will ever have seen before, but obviously the director has a love of musicals, beacuse he had the knack of knowing exactly which pop song would go with each scene. There is even an original song, &quot;Come What May&quot; which really makes the movie for me.It has everything, romance, adventure, a villain that you love to hate, humour, pathos and tragedy. Watch it and you will never look at films in the same way again.No film since has matched up to Moulin Rouge.Reeviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Shadows of the Rose.	5.0	Spectacular, Spectacular!	2002-06-25	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2PDE8KSTSAVR9	Ann	The entire time I watched this movie I was absolutely miserable. Kidman's voice ruined classic songs (for me at least) and it was just way too eccentric for me, which is funny because I liked Across the Universe and that's very eccentric as well . . . It seemed to just try to have shock value more than anything else. It was a very plot driven movie with not much character work. I can understand that some people like this but I really couldn't stand it. If I could give it zero stars I would.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3BBD1I8VTC7NH	"A. P. ""albino squirrel"""	"I think certain criticisms of this movie are unfounded.If you complain the movie gave you a headache, was too frenetic, or that you thought the singing was bad, I can understand.  This movie WAS very over-the-top, and opinions regarding singing vary widely from person to person.However, some criticisms really make no sense to me.  One reviewer says that the movie is not really about love, that it's about movie love.  The reviewer also says the characters fall instantly into ""genuine"" love (thus, it's unrealistic).I see nothing wrong with the characters falling in love so quickly.  How many people complain that Romeo and Juliet fall in love too soon?  Furthermore, this movie was not even attempting to make the content realistic.  That's glaringly obvious, so why dismiss the way the characters fall in love?  The vehicle for their love was NOT a drawn out relationship, kindled over time.  The vehicle was music, as the director said, and we are supposed to understand the EMOTION of the situation, not analyze whether Satine and Christian ""dated long enough"" or not.  Well, you could do that, but that would be missing the point...Also, many people imply the movie is obviously bad because they, or many other people in theatres, walked out in the first 20 minutes or so.  At the same time, many people say the popularity of the movie is only explained by the masses being so stupid that they don't know any better.  Now, how many idiotic movies are shown every single year that people sit through, with maybe only a few people leaving, while the others just understand the movie was mediocre or worse, or actually like them?  I don't think people walked out on the movie because it was ""bad.""  I think people rejected it because it was incredibly different and in-your-face, and they it just insulted their ""sensibilities,"" not necessarily their intelligence.Lastly, why do so many people seem to insist that the movie stank because it wasn't intellectual high art or something of the sort?  Is all art supposed to be crafted for the ""intellectual elites?""  One's life will be sorely lacking in joy if they insist that all their entertainment be based on reason, logic, and intellectual ""depth.""There is nothing wrong with art being colorful, frantic, passionate, and riddled with archetype.  I'd rather watch a Bacchanalian celebration of emotion, music, and sorrow than have the world overrun by only ""highly intellectual"" productions.  Art can appeal to the senses, the intellect, or both, and Moulin Rouge appealed to our senses and emotions.  There is simply nothing wrong with that.  You don't have to like it, but your distaste does not necessarily mean the movie is bad in itself.I don't think this movie is an absolute good.  It's so unusual that some or many people are bound to dislike it.  I just think some of them expect the movie to be something that would not be an improvement over what it is, and because Moulin Rouge relies on emotion and sensuality, a purely rational critique of movie does not do it justice.See it for yourself.  If it evokes wonder, excitement, sorrow, and mirth within you, it has succeeded.  If it leaves you cold, that's okay too, but I don't think such a reaction can totally be blamed on the movie--a viewer must participate with any form of art for it to succeed."	5.0	Everyone has their tastes, but...	2002-02-01	2	1	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3RWU5ZDNK8AXZ	Aranion	This film completely overwhelmed me, both sense-wise and emotion wise. No, I didn't go blind. No, I didn't cry my eyes out. But it still flooded me, surrounded me, immersed me in its vision of life, love, and what's important.Its setting is nearly arbitrary -- as Ebert has pointed out, this is the Moulin Rouge of your teenage imagination -- your teenage imagination confounded by absinthe. Gaudy, lively, bursting with colorful, creative, contorted characters, it is the kinetic center of 1899 Paris.Plenty of others describe the plot. Young idealist falls in love with jaded courtesan. Courtesan falls for young idealist. Money and the future of the Moulin Rouge interfere. A mind-blowing play-within-a-movie finale culminates the movie.Visually and aurally,the movie is a two-hour feast for film lovers. Luhrman and the movie's production designer and costumer have, like Tim Burton and the Gotham of the Batman movies, created an entire city, though more specifically a certain sector, entirely from their wild imaginations. Exquisitely detailed sets, textured costumes, and music, music, music come at the viewer like a tsunami of sensation. Yet once the initial crash of sound and fury hits, the movie pulls back (a bit) and allows the viewer more room and time to get to see and know this fantastic world.Enough people have chimed in about the music, so I will keep my comments here short. First, you should know I generally hate musicals. And I loved this film. Whether it's because I already &quot;knew&quot; the songs (though for all intents and purposes, they are radically redone/interpreted here), or because I was swept along with the movie, the songs worked. And many of the songs are not &quot;sung&quot; but act as the soundtrack. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman acquit themselves nicely, especially McGregor. Second, the songs and music are part and parcel of the heart of the film---it simply wouldn't be the same without it.Both the production design and the songs all benefit from the camera work in the film -- crazed and intense, it swoops, dives and sharply cuts, sinks us into the hot, beating heart of the movie.The story itself is an unabashed, unapolagetic, shout-it-from-the-rooftops paen to love. LOVE. Even with the tragic bookends of the movie, it's easy to see the theme is love is worth any price you pay--once two people connect and intertwine, nothing else is more important. And yet it's not about selfishness, about the modern preoccupation with serving one's self without regard. Integral to the plot is Satine's dedication to the theater company, and it's easy to see that Christian and Satine are both inspired by their love, and the inspiration is used to create a play for the company. Christian's openness and enthusiams affects more than just Satine--it draws the viewer in, fills you with hope and happiness, and you revel in the newfound joy of these two characters.On one level, it's a very old story -- young idealist falls for jaded courtesan -- but it's done with such genuine passion and refreshing excitement that it feels new. Contrast it with the &quot;love story&quot; of Pearl Harbor -- three entirely unrealistic &quot;characters&quot; created solely for manipulating the audience. I'm a fairly cynical person, and yet &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; still touched me, spoke to the sleeping romantic within.If you like cookie-cutter plots and restrained, &quot;real-life&quot; dialogue, stay home. If you want to be swept off your feet, sing your heart out and laugh out loud, support Luhrman's creative vision and treat yourself to a great film.	5.0	A Visual and Emotional Feast for Eyes and Soul	2001-06-15	0	0	0

Surrealistic scenery is melded with very real emotion very much like &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; is spiced with &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot;  It sounds strange to talk about it, but it works in wonderous ways.  Pay special attention to the &quot;Roxanne&quot; tango, too. . . it's mind-blowing.I'm always reluctant to see anything that is heavily lauded to me because it never lives up to my expectations.  Moulin Rouge surpassed them.  Love it or hate it, you should see it if only to appreciate what Luhrman has done to the art of filmmaking.  Even if you don't appreciate his innovation, even if you don't like the incredible melding of McGregor and Kidman's voices, even if you don't like the blatently silly sense of humor that permeates even the darkest moments. . . you at least have to love the costumes.	5.0	A Spectacular Spectacular Surprise	2001-12-26	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AJNASAHFDXKTZ	Audrey	This Story Is About Love.If you're looking for an original storyline, don't look here. They tell you right away - it's about love. And that's simply all it's about. And right away, they even let you know the fate of the main characters as we journey into the crazy flashback that is Moulin Rouge.Basically, the story is about a poor writer(McGregor) who gets involved in the Bohemian scence in Paris. He falls in love with a courtesan(Kidman) in the thrilling nightclub, the Moulin Rouge. It follows your typical plot - guy meets girl, guy falls in love iwht girl, awful tragedy and hardship destroys relationship, they get bcak together, bittersweet romantic ending. But, of course, the plot is not the most important part of the movie.Although the story may lack in orginialtiy, the way it is presented is Spectacular! Spectacular! The fast paced camrea shots really give you a feeling of the fast-paced, crazy atmosphere of Moulin Rouge - it definitely left me feeling breathless! And as the story grew more serious, the colors, the camera movements, the angles - they all matched the mood of the events in the story.Sometimes, musical movies can feel odd and songs feel out of place, but Moulin Rouge skillfully pulled off the transitions into song. I always felt that it was totally natural for the characters to be singing when they did sing. The mix of familiar songs was awesome - everything that they spliced together fit well into the events of the film. I'm waiting for a full soundtrack to be released with all the great songs and versions of songs used in the film that are not included on the current CD. While Moulin Rouge used very few original songs, I felt the prior connotations the songs held helped provide an even better understanding of the emotions the movie sought to produce.The often fast paced action of the movie would have left many original songs far behind in the gears of our brains. But the familiarity of the songs allowed for us viewers to stay caught up in the fantastical world, letting the connotations of the songs to catch up with us while we stayed immersed in the busy madness.I was especially impressed by Ewan McGregor's awesome singing ability! His acting was also superb, but his voice was surprisingly dazzling. When I went to watch the movie in the theatre, during the beginning of the film the theatre was filled with the usual rustlings and mumblings of moviegoers. When Ewan started his first song, however, an audible silence covered the crowd as they listened to his clear and gorgeous voice.While the movie has an incredibly simple plot that can be found in almost any love story anywhere, the point is not the plot. This movie is about pure, raw, emotion grabbing you by the collar and yanking you into its world. It definitely takes you for a wild ride through the spectrum of feelings. The movie has romance, drama, humor... it leads you through joy, despair, bubbling cheers, uncomfortable laughter, shock, surprise. As you stop to catch your breath, it simply grabs you again, dragging you into another breakneck sprint of emotion. Being a hopeless romantic myself, I was engrossed by the relationship of Kidman and McGregor. Although it was altogether too familiar and predictable, the portrayal of the key moments and how we got there was thoroughly enjoyable. Even those who do not neccessarily enjoy love stories can enjoy the art of this film. It is definitely one of the better movies for this summer and I highly reccommend that you go out and watch it!	5.0	But Above All Things...	2001-06-10	6	5	1

I must say she is delightfully suprising in that she is a very talented vocalist! Ewan McGregor also has this suprising talent, in this Spectacular story of Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all, Love!This story of a cortisan, Satine, and penniless sitar player, I mean writer, Christian, is timeless, yet refreshing. Like many recent films,(Titanic, Pearl Harbor, etc) this film takes a time in world history, in this case Paris's infamous nightclub, the Moulin Rouge, and injects right into it a lovestory, that suprisingly, works without a hitch!Unlike those films, the emotion of love is not shown though the action of love, but rather, the sounds of love, taking to song, which of course reminds us that this story is one of fantasy, as all films seem to be, as is there reason for existance.It is true that this seems to be a love it or hate it film. But those who hate it, are those who cannot understand the language of song, and hate it in film. Those who love it embrace song on film, and would also be recommended to take a look at the legandary Judy Garland's body of work, including &quot;A Star is Born&quot;, &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;, &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot;, and &quot;Easter Parade&quot;, just to name a few.I think Nicole Kidman was perfectly cast as the ill-fated cortisan Satine, and brings an Acadamy Award nominated performance to the screen, one that is undoutedly not to be missed! This DVD is packed with extras, which makes it all the more desirable to those wanted to know every backstory of this film's construction and creation from concept to completion!A wonderful film, with a wonderful cast, rent it now, you will love it!	5.0	Spectacular, Spectacular, Moulin Rouge!	2002-04-07	2	1	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AHSY48775P8RI	Avalon Daughter	What a relief to see some actual artistic attempt at a movie!  In the recent years of &quot;Freddie Got Fingered&quot; and &quot;American Pie&quot;, I can say personally I'm VERY happy to see a movie that isn't about shock value.  Judging from the reviews of people I can see that I'm not the only one who feels this way.Moulin Rouge is not cluttered as I found some critics to think.  Nor do I think it was loaded with special effects.  Rather, it was the angles of the camera, the blue filters, the quick shots, the costumes the imagery and the characters, of course, the characters.  I didn't find anything cliche in this entire movie.  I was moved, I was enthralled and just fell in love with the lovers themselves. Ewan was especially moving, from his natural talent for acting that I believe branched forward from his usual work to his superb singing that I never knew he could do before.  Nicole Kidman I always thought was a diamond in the rough and am glad to see her finally attemping something more high brow.Then there is the question of the story:  was it real?  Are you sure it wasn't the absinthe that Christian drank?  Was it simply a story that he wrote because his father badgered him and he obeyed him?  Or how about the symbolism?  The multi-million dollar necklace that Satine wore:  was it a &quot;collar&quot; of slavery from the Duke?  Or how about the elephant room?  Is it just an elephant or does it really mean courage and strength for Christian and Sabine?  A really good movie is one that makes people think: that keeps them talking and wondering about the endless possibilities that they can come up with to describe or define what it really was about.Of course, we do know for sure that the movie was about love.  That, above all, is for fact.  Most of the critics who bashed this movie from what I've read hated it simply say it &quot;was a whirlwind of chaos&quot; or &quot;watching a hyperactive child on pixie sticks&quot;.  In my opinion, they were too stupid to get the point and simply attempted to think up cute cliches in order to make their writing seem clever.  What they forgot is it's groundbreaking, it's new, it's fresh and above all IT BREAKS THE RULES.  Most importantly it breaks the rules.  God knows we don't need another Rambo movie to simply rot our brains.  We relate to it for it's modern music in a historical setting, it's elaborate color-like dream fantasy portrayal and most of all for the feeling that true love has on someone -- we all want that. And the love between Christian and Satine is believable.It's about time Hollywood attempted to bring back some type of creativity to movies rather than action, giggly women and stupid humor.  I'm hoping that a movie such as this will inspire more openness rather than simply ripping off the concept (ahem... Matrix anyone?)  Otherwise, I'm just going to get my fill from the Discovery channel.	5.0	Groundbreaking and spectacular	2001-08-02	1	1	0

After watching this movie the first time, the shock factor reached something along the lines of my first viewing of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show.&quot; I was left thinking after each scene &quot;Wow, what just happened? That went by so fast!&quot; The soundtrack uses various songs from different movies and popular bands in a wild mix of musical fun. On top of that, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have very beautiful voices, and the song &quot;Come What May&quot; made chill-bumps run up and down my spine!If you enjoy musicals, this is a MUST-SEE!	5.0	Wow!	2002-09-14	1	0	1

Its got everything---and it almost looks like it was set up for them as an audience. Ugh. As an adult....eeew. I found this movie hard to sit through. I was disappointed that all the songs seemed to be taken from other sources. No originals---would we put up with an original musical, however, nowadays? Yes, the whole movie is eyecandy, the story is the sappy story of love and all that and the obstacles against them. Sweet story. Yes yes. And the whole dying scene was overdone, overplayed. It was just---too romantic for me? Dare I say that? I just wasn't impressed. I guess I didn't get it. Satine's name even looks like its spelled wrong.The whole premise: a bohemian dude shows up at the Moulin Rouge and falls for the courtesan, Satine ie Nicole Kidman. Always gorgeous yet cold. He has never fallen in love. Boo hoo. Well, they fall in love. But the duke! He must have her! The evil duke must have whats mine! The young lovers meet behind the dukes back, tee hee. Then the scenario builds to its finale, Satine is dying, oh the drama! If you are between the ages of 7-27, I believe you'll love this movie. Don't get me wrong, I cried in the end too, but boy was I glad it was over! Yeehaw!	3.0	Teen girls can sigh and be proud!	2002-07-25	3	1	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AORW1FRF4D4KS	azindn	"Moulin Rouge is not a perfect film but it is original and eye dazzling compared to other musical films such as Chicago. With newly dumped, Nicole Kidman as the doomed beauty, Satine, Ewan McGregor, the young idealistic writer, Christian, Jim Broadbent as Zigler, John Leguzzamo as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Richard Roxbury, the evil snidley duke, this is the cast of casts.  Special features on the the DVD allow one to use the slow motion features and different camera perspectives to see everything from several angles that were a wild blur in theater screenings, and there are several hidden easter egg features which supply additional historical context to the story or production worthy of attention.  This is a well researched film thanks to the dilligence of Catherine Martin who won two Oscars for her work on the film's costumes and production.Director Baz Luhrmann is an artist of unusual visual aplomb, his previous theatrical training in opera is never more pronounced than in this production.  What is literally the operatic marriage of several familiar storylines from La Bohem and Camille to Top Hat-meets-the Marx Brothers is set within overwhelming staged productions featuring the loud entrance and exits of a circus of singers and dancers all engaged in over the top performances. Moulin Rouge as Luhrmann presents it is nothing less than stunning, original theatre as performance and at the very least, compulsive toe-tapping fare.Like another cutting edge director of another generation, Franco Zefferelli, Luhrmann cast unusually attractive actors not readily known for their singing ability in the lead roles of Christian (Ewan McGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman).  Their physical beauty enhanced the pathos surrounding the film's predictable and obvious romantic storyline, a point that could have been developed better.  Utilizing recognizable songs from the recent top 40 charts and combined with Broadway standards among others, McGregor and Kidman seranade each other with believable natural vocal talent enhanced by superb orchestrations and music arrangement.Many critics of the film commented that musical interaction and dialogue is unrealistic in Luhrmann's production, moreso a distraction in Moulin Rouge, but I disagree.  Moulin Rouge is a musical/drama, a genre where it is expected the actors speak and sing while acting.  No one in Moulin Rouge disgraces themselves with anything but superior and in some instances exceptional performances.  In supporting roles are a multi-talented cast that include John Leguizamo as Henri Toulouse-Lautrec who spurs Christian to write the bohemian rapsody ""Spectacle Spectacle,"" Jim Broadbent (Topsy Turvy) portrays Harold Zigler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge as a soft-hearted yet ambitious businessman, and Richard Roxburgh in the role of The Duke is a dopey dupe who steals every scene from McGregor and Kidman whenever they appear together.  But for most it is the sheer spectacle of Moulin Rouge that sweeps up viewers with swishpan flashes of dazzling costumes and fast edits all that combine to create divisive audience and critical reaction, a perspective that defines good art at its best.  Once the dust of public opinion settled, Moulin Rouge continues be an excellent DVD or video for every home collection.  It marks the status of the new musical post millenium, and harolds the return of the full ensemble musical. Thank you Bazmark, Nicole, and Ewan!!"	4.0	Love, Loss, and Lunacy at Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge	2001-06-30	9	8	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AHYPS5FZPVSEW	"Azra Mandzuka ""amanh"""	I reluctantly agreed to see this movie with a friend last summer when it came out in theatres. I didn't think I'd really like this kind of film; but much to my surprise, I really enjoyed it! Set in the rough side of Paris around the turn of the century, Moulin Rouge! is about a penniless yet charming writer portrayed by Ewan McGregor who falls for the beautiful courtisan, played by Nicole Kidman, of the Moulin Rouge nightclub.Kidman and McGregor sparkle on screen; there is definite chemistry between them. Their romance is threatened by a rich Duke who desires but does not love Kidman's character, Setine. When the Duke learns that Setine loves McGregor's character, he becomes insanely jealous. What follows is a wildy colorful and entertaining story that leaves you laughing. What really makes it funny are the songs in this film: they're from the 70's and 80's. Kidman and McGregor have pretty good voices and pull it off well.The supporting cast is marvelous and their characters come alive. The singing, the dancing, and the acting electrically explode on screen. The costumes, make-up, props, and the artwork and design make a spectacular film worth seeing. I highly recommend it!	5.0	Dazzling! Spectacular! Great fun!	2002-06-26	3	2	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ACOO1NZKALM44	AzureBlu	"You know what? I really did NOT like this movie when I first saw it. Why? Because it came with the topic where one of the main characters (a great character mind you) dies at the end. Something of which is a major rule on my part to stay away from these types of movies like the plague. AND everyone and the type of speed of the scenes made everything ""loopy"" and at times making me sea sick. Of course when I first saw it, I wasn't in a...peachy mood. Later, I decided to play fair and see it again and I'm glad I did. The 'death' scene didn't bother me as much as it should have because I think the way the story was played out made it easier to swallow. The one thing that I loved from the start was the music, dancing and everything else that had to do with creativity. I have the soundtrack that I can't seem to stop listening to and I (of course) have the movie that I never tire of.It's WELL worth your time and money on this one.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3EUSH8DPW75LR	barry	Moulin Rouge was already a film with a huge cult following before its appearance on blu ray.  A blu ray transfer of a film when done correctly is an amazing experience and raises a films clarity and quality stratospheres of levels.  But when not done well a film can even look worse than the dvd.  So for a film as lush and dynamic as Moulin Rouge it would seem it was made for blu ray.  So - how does it look and sound?  There are no words to describe how amazing it is.  This film truly was made for blu ray and all its qualities are made that much better.Moulin Rouge may not be for everyone's taste but it is truly an artistic masterpiece made with great ambition.  That cannot be denied.  It is a big, bold and clever extravaganza.  It also miraculously used top 40 tunes from various decades to tell a beautiful, romantic love story and in the process bring the musical back to a place of relevance.  Old and new comes together and visually and musically the film soars from beginning to end.  The cast is superb with major star turns by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.  Tour de force performasnces by both.Now to the blu ray transfer.  The video is truly a stunning presentation here and shows blu ray to its true best capability.  The colors are so vibrant and seem to jump off the screen.  The black levels, skin tones and overall clarity of picture are just truly amazing.  And then you add in the audio which would either make or break this film.  Well rest easy Moulin Rouge fans for the audio is rich and expansive.  Dialogue is very strong and clear and the music takes a life of its own.  This beautiful audio transfer makes use of all the speakers even when there is no music.  This blu ray presentation honestly will make you feel as if you are inside Moulin Rouge.  With this movie music and its use in a film are also brought to a new level.  The film is magical, creative and a truly romantic fantasy experience.  The blu ray transfer is beautiful and makes this a must have for fans and will definitely bring new admirers to this movie through its magic.  Highly recommended.	5.0	Moulin Rouge on blu ray - amazing!!	2011-02-18	10	10	0

The red curtain parts and you are sucked down into the vortex of Paris in its late 19th-century decadence.  While workers toil in factories and sweatshops, artists and writers beat their creativity to a froth with infusions of absinthe and morphine.  At night, the syphilis-ridden aristocracy flock to be entertained by the exotic denizens of the Moulin Rouge.  And if you think the cancan is romantic, you've failed to realize that all those legs in the air are making the same gesture as an erect middle finger. (Voulez-vous?) Then She appears--Satine, the ""Sparkling Diamond,"" whose crystalline skin conceals a terrible, tubercular secret.  Christian, a penniless poet who seeks truth and beauty, is besotted.  Also besotted is a certain Duke, who wants Satine to have supper with him, an occasion at which she will be not only the guest of honor but also the main course, in a manner of speaking.  Buffoonery, magic, and a Bollywood extravaganza ensue, not necessarily in that order.  Everybody sing (except the Duke, please)!  Everybody dance!  And it all leads to the darkest heart of the story, where a narcoleptic Argentinean and a prostitute enact Christian and Satine's story in The Sexiest Tango Ever.  Will Satine choose Christian's love, or the most expensive diamond necklace ever made for a movie, given to her by the Duke?  Will the show go on, or will Satine die in the middle of it, coughing up what's left of her lungs?  Will Toulouse-Lautrec have a little more absinthe?  And-the most important question of all--is this a serious exploration of love in an insane asylum or just an extravagant joke on us?

At the opening of the movie I hoped that it would be a mocking homage to the MTV generation, done in a very interesting style.  I soon found out that the movie could not decide if it was the former, a stream of consciousness comedy bizarre, or a serious (albeit extremely trite) love story.  Some people bill this as the genius of the movie, I see it as serving no larger artistic purpose, and thus merely distracting and frustrating.  Add to this the facts that all of the music was stolen, not performed in ways that give integrity to the original artists, and the lead male vocals were horrible; spell an absolutely horrible cacophony of a movie.

At the suggestion of a close friend, I decided to go against my better judgement (I loved &quot;Gosford Park,&quot; just to give you some idea of how &quot;against my better judgement&quot; this was) and watched this film. I started hating it with a passion almost immediately, as soon as John Leguizamo (what a waste of his comic talent!) started lisping and Ewan McGregor sang &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot; For the opening sequence, in the Moulin Rouge, especially, but also for the whole movie, the cameramen must have been working under the influences of amphetamines or something, because the camera moved so quickly I thought I would puke. I tried to sit through it, and succeeded, but it was difficult because of a problem (for me) that repeats throughout the movie, and it is this: I'm sure that I'm not the only one who has trouble watching men in top hats and tailcoats waving there hats and white gloves, singing, &quot;Here we are now, entertain us!&quot; Kidman's performance of the various &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; numbers was passing, but still unbearable. Maybe, just maybe, if the writers had enough creativity and vision to actually write original songs (what a thought!), the movie might have been far better, because we would always be waiting to see what kind of song was coming up next, as opposed to knowing for a fact that it would be some over-blown classic. And poor Ewan McGregor, obviously straining his tenor's falsetto on camera! What an embarrassment.But, there was one redeeming quality to this movie, one thing that kept it from being completely awful, and that was its eagerness to please. It was endearing, and this was the only conceivable reason to explain how I sat through the whole mess.	2.0	Awful, but Endearing	2002-08-02	4	1	3

I must admit that it's visually stunning, and has moments of pure greatness where the emotions soar. BUT...In the end, it comes off a little too &quot;comic book&quot; to be a great film. Overly trendy, the movie seems to pander a lot to the latest pop culture. Hardly any of the music is original, and it gets a little tedious after awhile hearing turn-of-the-century characters belt out &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; or &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; And sometimes, Ewen McGregor just runs around with an idiot grin singing &quot;Come what may...&quot; over and over.A great movie with a lot of distractions is no longer great, to sum up.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2YAABMT80RLYA	Ben Rowland	Though not for every taste, Moulin Rouge is one of the most original and inspring movies made in recent years. It is a acted half in voice, half in song. It is a classic love story about a rich-in-spirt but short on cash writer (Even McGregor) who falls in love with a beautiful, but largely inaccessble entertainer (Nicole Kidman). They embark upon creating what will be the best play of all time, and it is to be performed in the Moulin Rouge, a gentleman's club known for it's spectacular stage shows. The writer and actress and the writer embark on a clandestine love affair, while under the watchful eye of a powerful Duke, who is paying for the production and to whom she is promised. It is a story about love, overcoming aclass and circumstance.While the story might not seem like much on paper, the way it was produced is sheer magic. The musical numbers are spectacular, and make Moulin Rouge worth repeated viewings. McGregor and Kidman are fantastic, lending their singing voices, while the incredible cast add the the majesty. Music lovers will notice modern pop songs inserted into the music productions, music from Madonna, Nirvana, Joe Cocker, and various others. You'll know them when you hear them.The DVD package gives you everything you could possibly want: trailers, music videos, star profiles, &quot;making of&quot; specials, interviews, and other goodies. Once you see the movie, you will definitely want to check out  the extras, which show how much work and dedication went into making Moulin Rouge. While Moulin Rouge would be good to own in any format, it is best to own it on DVD, since you get all the extras, which are quality, not filler.A lot of my friends loved this movie, and a lot of them hated it. It is all a matter of individual taste. I loved everything about this movie, and it will remain on my list of favorite movies.	4.0	A great movie in a great DVD package.	2002-06-23	1	0	1

Erickson ""boycorrupted"""	"This is another one of those movies that I never saw in the theatre for whatever reason, and now that I've seen the DVD, I wish I had.  ""Moulin Rouge"" is straight-up eye candy.  It's an exquisite edifice built up around a ""story"" so totally inane and shallow that even the characters in the story remark on the fact in between cartwheels and costume changes.  But that's ok.  As it exists, it's really nothing more than a paean to 20th century pop culture - but a damned spectacular paean.  It's literally eye-popping.  Anybody who wants to complain that it doesn't accurately depict ""Paris 1900"" is willfully missing the point.  If the anachronism of ""Like a Virgin"" 85 years before its time is just too much for you to process, I suggest you go rent ""You've Got Mail"" or whatever and relive the late 90's exactly as they really were for practically everybody, and leave me alone.  ""Moulin Rouge"" relies on a gimmick, or, to be nice, a ""convention;"" namely, that of expressing the emotions of the characters and the development of the plot through pop songs, so that what you really have is a musical with immediately familiar lyrics and emotional associations built in.  It's tantamount to hip-hop's often unlikely sampling of pop music for its own creative ends.  Some say it's cheap and easy and reflects the superficiality and indolence of our consumer culture; others say it's the next evolutionary step in creativity.  I say it's just another form, but a potentially brilliant one.  It's collage.  And in ""Moulin Rouge"" it's beautifully done, although definitely an instance of style over substance.  The plot might make you gag, but your eyes won't get bored.  Nicole Kidman is always nice to look at, and she gets the hard-core glam treatment here in her Barbie-the-circus-performer getups.  Ewan MacGregor is all toothy cuteness and naive charisma like always.  They can both really sing too; MacGregor in particular sounds like he should've released an album in the 80's.  John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Latrec is amusing in an irritating sort of way with his tweety-bird speech impediment and artificially diminished stature.  I don't know who that is playing the Count but he is the smarmiest, most rat-looking...I have ever seen.  Good casting.  If you want to be visually blown away by a film, see ""Moulin Rouge.""

I just looked through all 354 reviews on this site and about 30 people said they couldn't stand it. Unfourtunately, most of those people said they left after 15-20 min. True the first 20 min of the movie are very fast paced, but it is mainly setting up the movie. Also many people say that the movie was predictable, probably because they say what happens in the begining.Most people who see this movie will not be dissapointed. from this site alone, it shows about 90% of people will consider it the best movie they have seen in a long time!	5.0	Great Movie!	2001-09-08	1	0	1

They combine Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", Lady Marmalade, the Can Can song, and some hideous rap song to create the most disturbing and freakish opening musical number ever.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3MPEDYM4DGS5O	BigSPEEGS	I know I'm going to get hate mail for this review. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is just one of those movies. Everybody just adores it, and you're stuck there thinking &quot;what?&quot; Sure, I could see where everybody's coming from. Love story, good production values, pop songs, and all that jazz. But &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a movie that is as easy to despise as it is to love.The premise is simple. Take a whole bunch of pop music, plop it in the middle of a turn-of-the-century atmosphere and stick in a love story. Some would say such simple words wouldn't be enough to describe this film, but really, that's all it is. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; seems more like a reason for a soundtrack than a film.Ewan McGregor is Christian, an aspiring poet traveling to France for inspiration. Little does he know, inspiration will without a doubt come his way soon, in the form of Satine (Nicole Kidman), a popular courtesan working in the Moulin Rouge. He instantly falls in love, but of course, he can't live happily ever after with her (&quot;The only way of lovin' me, baby, is to pay a lovely fee!&quot;) And Satine has other plans for her future than spending it with Christian, and as her dreams to become an actress start to turn into reality, the greedy Duke of Monroth tries to bind her exclusively to him. So, take this, throw in &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and more, and what do you get? A ludicrous fiasco that's not even fun enough to be a sequel to &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (yes, that IS a movie...)For a while in the beginning, the film is a joy to watch. But this lasts only a few minutes, for as the story starts to develop, the film stops having fun with itself and begins to set up a serious, dramatic mood. That would work if this was any other movie. But in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, the utter ridiculousness of the placement of pop songs undermines anything notable. In the first scenes, I smiled when Christian randomly blurts out &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;All You Need is Love&quot;. Very quickly, however, I was getting tired of all the oo-la-la. By the time Zidler (Jim Broadbent) is singing &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, I was laughing at them, not with them. And don't even mention the ill-timed musical number set to &quot;Roxanne&quot;.I have to admit though, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman certainly do have the pipes to carry out the job. They sing with passion (the same can't be said about a certain Mariah Carey) and truly bring out some spirit in the middle of all the chaos. It's too bad the film is such a pain, because they give performances worthy of recognition. The rest of the cast seems like they're having a good time, which does make the film slide along a little easier.&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; starts with an idea that something could be done with. However, director Baz Luhrmann sells-out completely, completely giving his movie up for commercial success. There is really little inspiration after the first shots, and the premise might be able to sustain for two hours if the way it was carried out wasn't so gag-inducing. Quick note to Mr. Luhrmann: it's a very bad sign when you're is laughing so hard during dramatic moments that at the end, your friend turns to you and suggests you leave &quot;before the people in the back start shooting&quot;.	2.0	Nausiatingly Overrated	2002-02-02	6	2	4
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A82MLYSUUU3CF	"Bil Antoniou ""Movie madness!"""	"Forcefully passionate, Australian director Baz Luhrmann's third film (after the marvelous Strictly Ballroom and the so-so William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is by far the best work he has ever done. Dropping you immediately into a carnivalesque world of magical and musical mayhem, the elaborate editing and production design help greatly in telling the story of a young writer (Ewan McGregor) who decides to live the bohemian life in the Montmartre district of Paris. Rooming across the street from the famous Moulin Rouge, he is drawn to the club by his curiousity to see the spectacles inside its decorated walls and to fulfill a job his new neighbour Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) has commissioned for him: write the club's brand new musical theatrical ""Spectacular Spectacular"", set to star the Moulin Rouge's main attraction, the courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman). Naturally, our young hero falls madly in love with the untouchable goddess, oblivious to the fact that her devotion is already being bought by an evil merchant (Richard Roxburgh, who also co-starred with Kidman's ex-husband Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible 2 which was filming in Australia at around the same time as Moulin Rouge). Despite its being set at the turn of the century, Lurhmann (brilliantly) uses music from all periods of the twentieth century, from Richard Rodgers to Nirvana, and uses it so appropriately and in such abundance throughout the whole film that all the songs add to the emotional substance of the story rather than call attention to themselves in a gimmicky way. Kidman and McGregor couldn't be better both as actors and singers, Kidman especially has never been more attractive, and the supporting cast topped by Jim Broadbent as the club's owner are all top-notch. Highlights in the musical include the chart-topping cover of Labelle's ""Lady Marmalade"", a beautiful rendition of Elton John's ""Your Song"" and an unforgettable tango version of The Police's ""Roxanne"". It's especially necessary viewing for musical lovers, but anyone will be moved by the passion brought about by these very talented actors in a story that is predictable in a nostalgic and beautiful rather than tired way."	4.0	Best musical since South Park!	2001-10-01	6	6	0

The first twenty or so minutes were a little strange, but give it a chance and this film really sweeps you off your feet.  I was awed one moment, and just weeping the next.  It is a delight to watch, but it is also very heart-wrenching.  As in...I was afraid I was going to burst into sobs in the middle of the silent theater.Nothing plays on our emotions like music, and that's where this film shines (along with the visuals, which I'll get to later.).  The songs were very touching and haunting, and pleasant to listen to.  You know how you'll be watching some musical, and a song starts to come up, and you're like...*YAWN*.  That never happens in this film.  The songs are just beautiful.To go along with the spectacular soundtrack is a visual feast for your eyes.  The film is just beautiful to watch.  The colors are dazzling, and the film's director wasn't afraid to give the film a surreal feel - when Satine and Christian kiss, fireworks burst in the background.  While this may not be realistic, it is very pretty and enjoyable to watch.  You'll never get tired of watching Moulin Rouge -- it is a thing of beauty.  You can watch countless sunsets and never get bored.  That's how Moulin Rouge is.Nicole Kidman is absolutely beautiful as Satine, and she has a great voice.  Ewen McGreggor is great as Christian - he has a great voice, too.All in all, this is a rare gem of a movie that's wonderful to listen to (I bought the soundtrack and I love it), captivating to watch, and the plot sweeps you off your feet.

After sitting through two hours of an awful story that was blatantly lifted from &quot;Shakespeare in Love,&quot; I was in a bad mood.  I realized I had seen what I consider to be one of the three worst films of all time.  Now, people who are more into visuals and less into story will like this, as the visuals are fairly interesting.  The music was interesting, since it was one medley after another, but I didn't find any of them very compelling or moving.  The cast was great, but couldn't do much with such a cliche script.  If I had my choice, I'd bury the master reel of this film at the bottom of the ocean, and pray that no other human has to endure the two hours of spoon fed schlock that I did.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	I'm not a musical movie fan (I cared very little for 'The Sound of Music...but I did watch it), so I approached this movie with trepidation.  My biggest regret now, is that I didn't go see it on the big screen; I'm sure it must've been even more dazzling than the DVD on my little TV.The musical story surrounds the life of a young man named Christian (played by Ewan McGregor) who comes to Paris in 1900 in search of life's inspiration (sounds kinda corny, I know, but keep reading) and finds it at the Moulin Rouge --- a famous dance hall of the period that really existed.  He stumbles upon Louie Lautrec (forgive the spelling, please) who was a brilliant poster artist and general artist (and doomed alcoholic) for the Moulin Rouge but here is given a larger role as a bohemian actor.  And from here Christian comes into contact with Satine (Nicole Kidman), a beautiful cortisan who aches to be a true actress.  Christian is immediately taken with her but so is another that night: a Duke who is deathly jealous of anyone who 'touches his things.'  He soon considers Satine 'one of his things.'  Initially Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke and unknowingly falls in love with him.  But soon she discovers that he is NOT the Duke, but it's too late.  She loves him, but he has no money...and the Duke does.  He can make her the actress she's always wanted to be.  What's a girl to do?The story is as old as Romeo and Juliet (star crossed lovers forced apart by greater circumstances).  There are obvious parallels to the recent movie 'Shakespeare In Love' as well.  But that's where similarities end and epiphany in Hollywood began; Someone left a director to his/her own devices!  And look what happened...BOOM! instant success and a possible classic.The filming of the sequences is dazzlingly and dizzingly perfect!  The sets and costumes were perfect!  And the acting was incredibly engaging (even for Kidman!).  The mesh of music, past and present, gave it a surreal quality---as if you were relegated to another plain of existence.  The dance scenes were...well...they left me speechless.  The scene with 30 couples doing the Tango left my mouth agape (dancing to an incredible version of Stings 'Roxanne').I was initially worried that the combination of music from the present with footage of 1900 Paris might be too close to another failed movie (A Knight's Tale), but this was not so.  This is on an entirely different level.  A level that I, as of yet, have seen no equal in the musical movie making industry.  I'm buying this one!	5.0	A musical for the times	2002-01-12	27	23	4

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A123R45FAVD6QI	"""bparker19"""	This fun film is full of visual stimulation and great music.  I don't agree with the assesment that the two leads, MacGregor and Kidman, can't sing--they do a fine job.  One of the potential problems with musicals is that they tend to focus so much on the songs that the scenes in between musical numbers can be wooden, or forced, and appear to be in the film just to move the story along to the next song.  There is none on this in Moulin Rouge.  The film is a success both in song and dialog because of superior acting.  Like another successful, &quot;modern&quot; musical called Grease, Moulin Rouge has a cast that inhabits the roles given them, and completely enraptures the audience all the way through to the end.My only complaint with this film is the frenetic, almost seizure-like editing at the introduction to the club.  With so much great choreography and amazing set design, they should have lingered a bit longer on the earlier scenes.  I guess they might have been going for the over-stimulated, perspective of the writer, but the film would have been better served by allowing the audience to be immersed in the club's atmosphere.The DVD is an amazing piece of work, with loads of extras.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AD2DDHLD6FRFM	Brad Baker	Christian, a struggling young poet, moves to 1899 Paris, joining the dark, fantastic world of the now legendary Moulin Rouge. Bedecked in the dazzling and newly-discovered electricity, Moulin Rouge introduces him to Satine, its most beautiful courtesan. Satine responds to his love, but nightclub owner Harold Zidler warns her to forget him. Her life is about satisfying men for the dollar. Not love. Zidler tells her: &quot;We're creatures of the underworld. We can't afford to love...&quot;. For Christian the doors to Moulin Rouge will only lead to sorrow...&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is exactly like those corny old musicals we all love--only completely different. An intoxicating entrance into the imaginative mind of master director Baz Luhrmann, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; has been nominated for 6 Golden Globe Awards. Fresh from her acclaimed role in the excellent horror-thriller &quot;The Others&quot;, Nicole Kidman sings and dances her way through &quot;M.R.&quot; with strength and clarity. Her co-star, Ewan McGregor, does not fare as well. McGregor played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; in 1999, and returns for &quot;Star Wars Episode II-Attack of the Clones&quot; in 2002, and &quot;Star Wars III&quot; in 2005. English born Jim Broadbent is superb as feisty showman Harold Zidler. Producer, director, and co-writer Baz Luhrmann filmed &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; in 1992. He directed Leonardo Di Caprio in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1996. The Australian director invested 4 years on &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, his third film. The music of &quot;M.R.&quot; is integrated masterfully between pathos, mad humor and green absinthe. The lead actors sing standards by the Beatles, Elton John, Madonna, Sting, and more, all with their own voices. The only original song, &quot;Come What May&quot;, is in fact the best. Fox's brand new &quot;M.R.&quot; DVD is 2:35.1 anamorphic widesreen DTS 5.1 Dolby Digital and THX. It's flawless. Disk 1 gives you the 2 hour movie and 2 separate commentary audio tracks. That's 6 hours of entertainment.  Disk 2, over 3 hours long, has a documentary, interviews, bios, photos and detailed reviews of set design, dance, music, and more. There are 2 videos of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. You need 9 hours to see it all just once. &quot;M.R.&quot; has 8 Easter Eggs. To find one hidden on Disk 2, go to Main Menu and select &quot;This Story is About&quot;. In the next menu, highlight &quot;Old Storylines and Script&quot;. In that menu, select the Return key. Now press the &quot;Right&quot; arrow on your remote control and a green fairy will appear. Press &quot;Enter&quot; and watch the director spout some off-color language. The other 7 Easter Eggs can be found on the Internet. A big, brassy colorful romp spinning 90 miles-per-hour,&quot;M.R.&quot; is a musical-comedy tragedy about love. As our young writer says: &quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return&quot;.	5.0	No laws. No limits. One Rule. Never fall in Love.	2002-01-16	1	0	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3P99SK4SPH3KO	Bradford LeHew	"I have always been a big fan of musicals, and I have to say that I was skeptical of a musical starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.  After all--could they sing?  Even though Nicole is no Patti Lupone, she does a delightful job in this Baz Luhrman masterpiece.  True to Baz's style, Moulin Rouge is wild, fast-paced and incredibly dramatic.  Ewan McGregor has a GREAT voice, much to my pleaseant surprise.The story is about Bohemian ideals and the search for love and truth.  A poor Bohemian artist, along with his host of absinthe-addicted friends (including a hilariously stunted John Leguizamo as Toulouse Letrec) sees the beautiful Satine as the epitomy of love.  They pitch their hastily compiled idea of a musical to the sleazy duke in ""Spectacular Spectacular.""  All the duke really wants is Satine.  All the rest of them want is to save the Moulin Rouge and reach some Bohemian nirvana.Much to the Duke's chagrin (you love to hate him) Satine has been taken with the Bohemian artist (McGregor).  Much to the artist's devastation, Satine is afflicted with tuberculosis.  The themes of love, passion, and social classism resound throughout this brilliantly made film.  If you are a fan of Baz Luhrman, you will love this movie.  The music and acting are fantastic.  The story is beautiful.  Watch it with an open mind!"	5.0	The Musical is BAAAAACK!	2002-12-31	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ABLWGDPUOSEXR	Bradford Wilson	Here we have a musical epic, filled with wonderful acting, a touching love story, and tons of great contemporary songs that fit perfectly into the plot.  Nicole Kidman plays 'Satine,' the star or &quot;Sparkling Diamond&quot; of the Moulin Rouge, French for The Red Mill, a night club filled with debauchery and licentious patrons and performers.  Satine is a courtesan, a fancy word for a prostitute.  Ewan McGregor plays Christian, the penniless writer who inevitably falls in love with her.The fate of the Moulin Rouge depends on a show, Spectacular Spectacular, that is being written by Christian and obviously being performed with Satine as the star.  She wants so badly to be a real actress on a real stage and in front of a real audience.  However, there is a catch;  she must fall in love with the Duke, who is providing the funding to transform the Moulin Rouge from a club into a theatre.  She must then put of the facade of being infatuated with the Duke while trysting with Christian, who has a relentless fascination with the notion of love.The movie fantastically portrays the conversion of Satine's mentality of love for money to love for salvation.  Christian opens her up and makes her see that love is the only thing important in life.  Christian, at the same time, learns that with love comes jealousy and heartache.  He becomes cold and bitter, and loses his faith in it's power.I went into this movie expecting another run-of-the-mill musical farce, but ended up being moved beyond belief.  I really felt with the characters and sympathized with them.  And there is a scene with Nicole Kidman, where she tells her boss she is running away, that is so well acted it brings her character to a whole new level.  All supporting characters are excellent as well.  See this film, even if you are skeptical, for this is truly a great one.	5.0	Something Different, Something Wonderful	2001-06-21	8	8	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ABIY2GGW6ZWD1	"Brandon Witt--redbirdboy ""redbirdboy"""	I was looking forward to this movie long before it came into theaters because of the previews.  Then, I went to see it.  I hated it, from start to finish.  There was not one thing I liked about it other than the songs done by Ewan Mcgregor.  Who knew that he had a great voice!?!  Everything was too loud and flashy.  All the songs had been done before; none were original, that I could tell of anyway.  It seemed extremely cheesy and overdone and stupid.  I was very upset, because I had bought the sound-track right before I went to the movie.  I started listening to it, and the more I listened, the more I wanted to see it again.  So, I went back.  From the beginning, I began to notice things I had not before.  It was amazing.  I became one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Everything that I hated the first time, I loved.  The overdone songs were pieced together brilliantly; the loudness, brightness, and over dramaticness fit together perfectly into a beautiful array of art and passion.  Without a doubt, it is the most uncomon movie I have ever seen.  Not everyone will like it, but give it a chance.  Probably a couple chances before you judge it or cross it off.  It is truly beautiful.  Probably the most gorgeous (as far as props and setting, not nature, etc.) movie I have ever seen.  I can not wait to own it on DVD!!!	5.0	The most bizar, beautiful thing I have ever seen.	2001-10-01	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1M39F553JEUSJ	Brenda Antrim	Finally made it into Westwood to see Moulin Rouge -- I was bound and determined to see it before it opened wide, and I'm glad I did.  The house was half full, kind of incredible when you realize it was a decent sized cinema in the middle of the afternoon on a Thursday, in a hard-to-get-to place the day before the movie opens everywhere.I can't remember the last time a movie made me laugh out loud, break into spontaneous applause (more than once), and hold my breath at the end.  It's hilarious, tragic, pure fun, over-the-top silly and surprisingly touching.  I'll never think of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; the same way ever again.  After hearing Ewan McGregor belt it out (he goes through more musical styles in two hours than most people do in a lifetime, and does them well) Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot; will never be the same either, but for vastly different reasons.  &quot;Come What May,&quot; the only original song in the film, is still playing in my head.  I think I'm a little dizzy, and that was after an hour-long drive home when I didn't play my radio because I didn't want to interrupt the songs echoing in my mind.The film is gorgeous.  I'm not sure if I was intoxicated or assaulted, and I *am* sure that's intentional.  The writing is weak, but that's to be expected -- the script isn't the thing here, the emotions are, and those are broad and naked and rapturous.The cast worked together beautifully, and put blood into it.  Rarely have I seen an ensemble throw themselves into their work as wholehearted as this one (if ever).  Nicole Kidman as Satine was described by a critic as 'game' in this, and I can see why -- she does a strong job, but she's miscast.  Happily, the film isn't actually about Satine, any more than La Traviata is about Violeta.  This is Christian's story, and Ewan McGregor is more than capable of carrying the film, because he's the heart of it.  And if this film is about anything, it's about heart.Each of the supporting characters is good, particularly the Duke and Ziegler.  The whole feeling is operatic, with high camp and severe pain interspersed, sometimes so closely together I got emotional whiplash.  Which is exactly how I was supposed to feel.I identified with Christian completely, from his initial confusion to his bursts of genius, through his discovery of love to his bitter feeling of betrayal, all the way until his heart led him back where he needed to be.  Even the colors of the film follow the pattern of Christian's experience -- the world is bright and chaotic and huge at the beginning, and as he experiences life and love and pain it gradually closes in to two buildings as the world is leeched of color.  The editing approached frenetic, but it worked by and large, especially during the Roxanne Tango (one of the two places that had me holding my breath).Kidman and McGregor both have excellent comedic timing, and McGregor also has a way of pulling the stops out and breaking your heart when you least expect it.  I can well understand why he's gotten good reviews even from reviewers who didn't like the film.  The music is surprising and fun and weirdly perfect for the story:  I say weirdly because I'm not sure Baz intended to get some of the reactions he got, but it worked.  This is one of those rare movies that will hit every culture that sees it in a different place, and if the audience is willing to suspend cynicism long enough to care about the heart being bared for them, then it will work everywhere it plays.This film worked for me because it does what opera used to do (and still can when it doesn't get too grand for its britches).  It takes a love story, makes it the center of the world, surrounds it with music, and drenches you in the experience.The audience in Westwood was a microcosm of what I expect the broad audience to be.  Women in clumps (it's a chick flick), couples (it's a date flick), gays (in couples and in clumps -- it's definitely going to be a hit with the unabashedly artsy among us).  I have a feeling the film's going to play relatively well in the US, and really well overseas, where they're not as embarrassed to be thoroughly entertained as we seem to be here.The overall impression I carried away from the film was hopeful and sad and brilliant at the same time.  I smiled all the way home, and given how the last scene at the Moulin Rouge (not in the film, but on-stage at the club) ends, that's saying something about the power of the two hours that preceeded it.I'm going to go see it again tomorrow (and I seldom see movies twice in the cinema).  I can't recommend it highly enough.  Leave your ennui at the door and prepared to be swept off your feet.	5.0	Extravaganza with heart	2001-05-31	17	15	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1V3UWZ9NRDRV2	Brent Holcomb	After garnering 3 Golden Globes (including Best Picture and Best Actress) and 8 Oscar nominations, the public is finally beginning to fully realize the audacity of ''Moulin Rouge.'' Baz Luhrmann's centerpiece of colorful, comedic brilliance and heart-wrenching sentimentality raises the standard of and reinvents the modern musical. Nicole Kidman portrays Satine, a French courtesan working at the Moulin Rouge, a turn-of-the-century nightclub. Despite numerous statements like, ''I can't fall in love,'' Satine eventually falls in love with Ewan McGregor, as Christian, a ''penniless writer.'' The story is mostly told in song, and director Baz Luhrmann pays homage to Elton John, Nirvana, and Patti LaBelle, among others. Reality is never an issue - ''Moulin Rouge'' knows that, and plays upon every aspect of that freedom. The lovers soar above the starlit sky, dance on clouds, and swing around the Eiffel Tower (all with a singing Man in the Moon in the backdrop). This fantasia makes for very interesting eye-candy, and leaves the audience overflowing with emotion. Kidman and McGregor shine as ill-fated lovers (who frequently and unabashedly burst into harmony) and help contribute to make ''Moulin Rouge'' the most ambitious and entertaining film of the past decade.	5.0	The Decade's Most Entertaining Film	2002-11-02	2	1	1

Couldn't have anything to do with the ridiculous performances (who else wanted to see John Leguizamo take a long walk off a short pier, and who else but me felt embarrassed for poor Jim Broadbent, terrific in so many other things), Baz Luhrmann's irritating directorial style (his target audience would appear to be 14-year old girls with ADS), or the banal music (&quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch,&quot; a REAL muscical, made fun of &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; pays homage to it).  This film is vapid eye candy stretched out over an exhausting 2 hours. Congrats, Baz---you've succeeded in inventing a new genre---the feature-length MTV video.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3ERX4U7T5TLY4	"""brezzie"""	In his commentaries, Baz Luhrmann is at great pains to justify every trick, gimmick and extravagance in terms of its service to The Story.It's a pity then, that in this regard, what seems to have escaped his attention is the script itself. The slender plot could well have done with some of the savage editing applied so ruthlessly to the dance routines, and would have been better served by a running time closer to 80 minutes.He also goofs by opening with the ending. He has a justification for this too, but it doesn't explain away the fact that it makes the story struggle to engage the audience who then see the simple mechanics of the plot laid bare. If you're going to take away with one hand the audience's anticipation of the ending, you have to offer them something interesting in return with the other, and he simply doesn't.What he does offer us is a visual feast. From the conductor standing in front of the Fox logo at the beginning, Moulin Rouge remains one of the most inventive and beautiful films ever made. It's impossible to take it all in at one sitting, and while some of his visual conceits work better than others, the sheer quantity of imaginative touches is breathtaking. This results in some real highs: the danceadelic introduction of the Moulin Rouge itself provides an astonishing adrenaline rush, and the rooftop `Your Song' really flies with old-style musical romance.But elsewhere, and at the crucial points, it all kind of gets in the way. We are constantly reminded-- and frequently for no very good reason-- that we are watching a film (see the gun clanking against the miniature Eiffel Tower). Ultimately, the film's cleverness, anachronisms, self-consciousness and eagerness to please have a distancing effect, holding the audience at arm's length outside the story while desperately trying to draw it in for its sentimental coda.Moulin Rouge is half the experience it should have been, but the half that works is more than worth the asking price.	4.0	Half full, half empty	2002-03-09	0	0	0

Because it has everything I love in a movie; music, dance, colourful sets and tales of far away exotic places, and an attractive and endearing couple involved in a tragic tale of love.  I was very impressed by the performances of both Ewan McGreggor and Nicole Kiddman, as they sang the songs themselves in the film. Dubbing the voices would have left us feeling detached from our &quot;heros.&quot;  So Bravo Mr. Luhrmann, for doing it right!  The music, a strange mix akin to &quot;Broadway meets Nirvana at the Metropolitan Opera,&quot; was brilliant.  Everything from Madonna (luv herrrr!), Phil Collins, The Beatles, and Fat Boy Slim to name but a few, have been fused into a music smorgasboard the likes of which have never been seen before.  McGreggor who plays Christian, a Bohemian writer, who adheres to the values of truth, freedom, beauty, and above all else LOVE, falls in love with Satine, played by Kiddman, a courtesan in the Moulin Rouge club of old Paris.  She is forced between staying with Christian (for love), or going with the evil Duke, who is financing her show &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular!&quot; A classic story that everybody can enjoy, Moulin is by far the most beautiful and original movie I've seen in years.  The strange, fast-pace of the film early on was difficult to focus on, but it soon subsided to a more pleasing pace.  That same rapid editing also robbed the audience of the chance to really see and enjoy the Moulin &quot;Can Can&quot; scene.  This was however, the only flaw I could find in an otherwise perfect modern musical.	4.0	&quot;Spectacular! Spectacular!&quot;	2001-06-05	3	2	1

Some my be put off by its editing others by its overly theatrical setting but on a careful viewing the movie comes off quite well and maybe a classic of musical moviemaking. Enough has been said on this site about the plot of the film so this review will look at some of the special features that make this a worthwhile purchase.The disc's high point comes in two separate commentaries: the first featuring Luhrmann, production designer Catherine Martin and director of photography Donald McAlpine. This commentary while technical gives a glimpse into the design of the film and the skill that went into mounting such a huge production. The second commentary features Luhrmann and his writing partner of 20 plus years Craig Pearce. This commentary is lighter and goes into the details of the writing process.The true genius of this DVD comes on the special feature loaded second disc. This material carefully put together by Luhrmann covers virtually every aspect of the filmmaking process. We have features on writing, design, marketing, the music and many other topics along with brief interviews with the involved artists.As said this is not a film for everyone but it is a unique film in that the director got to express his creative vision with essentially no holds barred. This disc is a memorable and fun look at the movie making process which I would recommend enthusiastically.	4.0	A view behind the velvet curtain	2006-03-15	3	3	0

I have kept hearing a voice telling me to honor the effect this movie has had on me in the past year. On this sunny morning, I have decided to do just that!I was first introduced to Moulin Rouge when it first came out. I saw it with someone to whom I was engaged at the time. We went to see it because we missed another movie. I fell asleep at the time. It just seemed so much, too many visuals and very schizophrenic. I couldn't handle it. I assumed the movie epitomized everything that I think is wrong with American culture and Hollywood.Flash forward to this summer. My new partner mentions to me that we should rent this movie. I have a violent reaction and absolutely forbid it! My arms are flailing, I'm stopping my feet on the ground and yelling ""NO WAY!"". In all of her wisdom, my new partner ignores me and rents the movie anyway. I am annoyed. She asks me why I am so against this movie. She says that I totally misunderstood the movie the first time or worse. She suggests that my ego was preventing me from appreciating the movie's religious significance. I am a Buddhist and she is a christian unitarian type. She mentions some reviews of the movie I should read. I read the reviews on here and the one on Hollywood Jesus dot com. I am blown away! I am almost ashamed at my blindness and my obvious unwillingness to be stretched to greater understanding and awareness. I was being a total stubborn snob and my partner is just much better at suspending disbelief.This movie has made me better able to appreciate the teachings I follow in day to day life. When I react badly to what Hindus call the manifestations of the Kali Yuga, I remember this movie. I remember that my disposition must be one of courage and lovingness and not just hot air, judgment and anger.I am definitely interested in learning more about Baz Luhrmann, Craig Pierce and Catherine Martin and their own spiritual journeys. I am officially intrigued how Hollywood people could produce one of my top 5 religious experiences in the past several years. That list includes meeting the Dalai Lama at a benefit for Tibet House!Thank you to the makers of this movie and to all of you out there who possess the insight, wisdom and patience to have helped me see it for what it really is underneath. Especially my partner."	5.0	Chock Full O' Secrets and Surprises	2004-09-19	10	3	7

The acting and music are top notch (Nicole Kidman deserves top honours for her performance in this movie).  The audio and video presentation are 10/10 (the movie was remastered to take advantage of the format's high definition capabilities).  All the supplements from the 2 disc dvd were ported over.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1JGEQF8TQYHJ9	buttercup	I'll admit, I wasn't sure what to think of the movie after the first viewing. However, the second time I saw it, it was wonderful.The plot's a good old-fashioned love story. Some might call it tired or cliched, but that only applies when it's not done well. When I saw the story unfold, I felt like I was watching the love story for the first time. When the first few words are spoken, you know that this is going to be a tragedy, yet the whole way through, there's plenty of laughter, plenty of high, giddy emotion. Just like the character of Zidler, everything in this movie's so over-the-top, you can't help but crack a smile and laugh. The best thing about this movie that I can say is that it made me feel. Usually when I watch a movie, I get all analytical and wonder about motivations and reasons for the characters' actions and all that garbage. For this, I just let go and let things come. I can't name too many movies that manage to do that.	4.0	Let go and get swept away	2002-07-30	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A29D5QW5366JBN	"""butterflies1500"""	I went and saw this movie in the theatre. In fact i saw it twice.  I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes music. Moulin Rouge is full of modern music,(everything from Sound of music to maddonna) and the weird thing is the movie  is set back in the late 1800s. It is a crazy movie.  I can describe it best by bringing up the Movie ROMEO AND JULIET, also directed by Baz Luhrman.  If you can reacll the party scene, when everything is fast paced and blured for only a few seconds. Now take that few seconds and spand that over a hour and a half, and thats Moulin Rouge.  Don't worry about it being too confusiing.  It takes some getting used to but you'll be fine.  OH i would like to state i brought my Brother and my dad to this movie.  My brother loves movies like Dumb and Dumber, American Pie, and pretty much every other teen movie, and he hates musicals. My dad loves the meaningful stuff like American Beauty.  The point of me telling you this is to show that this movie is for everyone.  And it'll be a perfect gift.	5.0	Colorful and Crazy movie	2001-11-22	0	0	0

The beautiful experience of the movie lies in its telling of a story championing love as the final truth of life.  This is an unaffected and charming performance that everyone must experience. A good portion of viewers will probably prefer the usual script as their source of distraction from their own scripted life.  For those who do not want to walk the designated route of life, this is your movie.  Freedom, beauty, truth and love are only cliched for those who are assimilated by the visual language of consumerism.  If you watch this movie and do not enjoy it, then evaluate your standards and see how deeply affected you probably are by the mass media crammed into your psyche."	5.0	the greatest thing you will ever learn	2005-11-21	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1QYJRU43SZVIL	"""cabaret_54"""	"Baz Lurhmann has created a stunning piece of eye-candy with the sumptious Moulin Rouge. Set in a turn-of-the century boheimian part of France, Moulin Rouge tells the story of Christian, the yong writer who falls in love with the sexy and sultry Moulin Rouge wanna-be actress Satine. The story follows their love story, complicated by the meanacing Duke, club owner Harold Zidler and the wonderfully comic Toulouse-Lautrec.The entire production itself is quite stunning, with Oscar-calliber performances coming from Ewan McGregor (Christian), Nicole Kidman (Santine), Jim Broadbent (Zidler) and John Leguizamo (Toulouse). McGregor and Kidman have excellent voices, adding a certain type of...stlye to their roles, claiming them as their own. Elephant Love Meadly and Come What May showcase their vocal talents, as well as being beautiful songs in the movie. I thought Ewan rocked in Trainspotting, but he's even better than this, his performance as Christian is priceless. Words cannot due justice to the performance of Nicole Kidman as the fading Satine, played with just the right balance of vulnerability and sex appeal. Both McGregor and Kidman deserve Oscar nom's for their performances. Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo also bring brilliant comedic perfornaces to this wonderful ensemble piece, but the movie truly belongs to Ewan and Nicole.The opulance of the Moulin Rouge and turn of the century Paris has been vibrantly brought to life by Lurhmann and his design team. The costumes of the can-can dancers at the Moulin Rouge are stunning, as well as the many dresses that Satine wears. Then there is the actual Moulin Rouge itself, both brilliant and decaying at the sametime, with it's iconic red windmill seemingly in the background of every shot. The choreography in the dancehall scenes is also fantastic, and the ""play within a play"" performance is equally as amaizing. It is obvious that Lurhmann spared no expense when it came to the production values...simply amaizing...Overall, this is one of the finest movies I have ever seen. It seems odd to have modern music in the picture, although it seemingly fits (especially the ""joke"" about the sound of music). Moulin Rouge is a great date movie, and even a good one for a rainy day. So even if you're not a big fan of movie musicals, rent Moulin Rouge at the very least and you will see, why ""above all this is a story about love...."""	5.0	The movie-musical is back and better than ever!	2002-01-26	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3CNH4VHQCHP37	"""cabbott88"""	There were some critics who said that this movie had little or no emotion tied in with the innovative special effects. I couldn't agree less. The entire production is about nothing but emotion, and I must confess that in the five-day period I rented it from the video store it hardly left the VCR at all. I wish there were more than five stars to use.However, I will definitely say that it is a love-it-or-hate-it situation. If one word was necessary to describe the entire product I would use &quot;bizarre,&quot; but if you're ready for a creative and new look at an otherwise commonplace plot, Moulin Rouge should be seen by everyone.	5.0	Not for the closed-minded	2001-12-24	1	1	0

The singing was terrible, the songs were rehashed and misplaced pop tunes (Ewan McGregor, grinning and slinking his way through ""Your Song"" by Elton John nearly destroyed my love of the tune), and the storyline was as thin as tissue paper.  My whole family hated it, so one might argue that our dislike of the film is genetic; however, I've run into others to whom I'm not related who also roundly despise this costly puff of fluff.  The only reason it averages 4 stars at Amazon, I believe, is because those of us who disliked it simply can't stand to think about it anymore, thereby keeping us from bothering to write about it.  However, here's my 1 star, and if I could give it none, I would."	1.0	Candy Coated Nothing	2005-04-18	16	7	9

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1248G9LHNPUDX	Carlos Avila	A younger generation does not know, or perhaps is not interested in, musical theater or musical films. But there was a time when great love stories, whether tragic or triumphant, and great drama was brought about through theatrics, film and above all, song and dance. The musicals of the early twentieth century, among them South Pacific, Carousel, The Sound of Music, The King and I, Oaklahoma and numerous others, combined visuals and great songs to carry out a genuinely beautiful story. Baz Luhrman, avant-garde artist extraordinare, manages to capture youthful and adult audiences with his MTV-style pop art movies (as Romeo and Juliet proved). Moulin Rouge is, in my opinion, a revival of a romantic musical. Only through great performances, such as Ewan Mcgregor's as Christian, the English poet lured into a romance with cabaret singer and courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman), can such a musical be truly successful. The love songs, especially played during the scene in which Satine and Christian talk about the nature of love atop a crystal elephant, includes the hits from the 80's like &quot;Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong&quot; and David Bowies' &quot;Heroes&quot;, the signature song of the whole movie is &quot;Nature Boy&quot;. The red curtain opening up to reveal an old-fashioned &quot;cinema&quot; successfuly evokes the period, along with the costumes and the recreation of the Moulin Rouge, an 1890's cabaret nightclub that would be the equivalent of Vegas for Victorian gentlemen. The movie was a marvelous piece of art, and I disliked the fact that it did not get the prestige it deserved, such as Best Picture Award. I highly suggest you own this movie which is definately Luhrman's finest masterpiece. I am also anticipating a live-broadway musical version of Luhrman's Moulin Rouge.

The first time I watched this movie, I turned it off after the first 15 minutes being quite confused.  I tried watching the movie again and after I knew what was going on, it became a great movie.  I think the key to actually liking this movie is to relate to it.  I am in a chorus and love singing which is probably why I loved this movie.  When I heard Ewan McGregor sing I was in awe.  It was great.  Then Nicole Kidman....wow!  I would buy the soundtrack alone for 20+ dollars!  Th plot can get a little &quot;cheesy&quot; somtimes but it still kept me entertained the whole time. I love this movie.  If you're thinking about buying this movie, I suggest you go and rent it before you by it.  As you can see in all of the reviews, it's either a hate it or love it movie.  Also, this DVD has an extra disc dedicated to extras (easily 3+ hours)!  Overall, I think ths movie is great with great exceptional singing by the two main stars; Ewan Mcregor and Nicole Kidman.Movie: A  Extras: A+  Sound and Music: A+  Replay Value(how many times you'll watch it over and over): A-I hope this review helped you.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AW3VZ5O895LRK	"carol irvin ""carol irvin"""	Get yourself into your cineplex at once to see this film.  It's going to loose some of its larger than life sweep when it goes to the smaller screen.  This is a towering work of the imagination which is matched by powerhouse performances.  I saw this with my friend Joyce and we both were equally enthralled from start to finish.  Joyce is not an artist but had no trouble following the abstractions in continuity Baz Luhrmann achieved with his fast edged cutting, blurring pace and sequencing.  As a director and writer, he is an expert at film collage. This is how a musical should be made in 2001.  The biggest problem the old movie musicals had were leaden pacing and the jarring sense of a song artificially intruding into a play. That is all gone here just like it was gone in Milos Forman's &quot;Hair&quot; and &quot;Amadeus&quot; and Bob Fossee's &quot;Cabaret.&quot;  What  formidable problems these modern masters have solved in the movie musical genre.  Ewan McGregor I could go on about for pages.  Neither Joyce nor I realized that he could sing.  Saying he can sing is like saying DiMaggio could hit a baseball or Monroe could play a sex goddess. He is that good a singer.  In fact, had he taken to the rock concert stage, he probably would be an even bigger star than he is right now.  Fortunately for us film fanatics, he is also a first class actor and chose to follow that call.  If he'd been around in the 1940s and 1950s, he would have had the lead in every major musical of the day.  I don't know if he can dance but I wouldn't be surprised if he can after this tour de force performance.  To top it all off, he's got great on screen charisma.  The camera loves him as it does just a few actors.  He's even got dark hair here and it totally works for him. Nicole Kidman also does a first class job.  She does a very good singing job but is not in McGregor's stellar singing class.  She also does a powerful acting job and looks wonderful in the part of Satine the courtesan. The rest of the cast is also very strong and you can tell they are all veterans of moving around stages and sets.  Jim Broadbent, playing the impressario, is superb even outside a British PBS production, his more usual venue, continuing on a theatrical riff like he did for Woody Allen in &quot;Bullets Over Broadway.&quot; The plot is operatic. McGregor is Christian in 1899 Paris, a penniless writer.  He falls in love with Satine, a dancer and courtesan at the Moulin Rouge theater.  She suffers from consumption (TB), which her stage family tries to keep secret.  A duke also wants to make her his mistress in order to back a new musical with her in the lead.  Christian presents an obstacle to the duke's plans, however.  Rather than this story's being leadenly told, however, you are audio and visually shown each facet to it.  When the film deals with jealousy, it is in a powerful performance piece that starts out with the tango performed on the stage by two other performers and moves outward from there involving other cast members. Modern music is used throughout, most of it rock music.  Luhrmann got it to work beautifully.  I've seen all three of his films and I prefer them in reverse order, his newest to his oldest.  Thus, this is my favorite.  &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; with DiCaprio and Danes is a strong second place but did not bowl me over to the extent this film did.  It showed the potential for &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; though.  &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; was very good but I would have never dreamed we were moving from there to this.  It's like moving from drawing with charcoal on a pad of paper to painting on huge canvases in oil. This is my choice of 2001's films for best picture Oscar so far and everyone in it is a strong contender for each of their categories as well. Knockout sets, costumes, cinematography, scoring and everything else inbetween to boot.  I just hope it doesn't lose out in the awards to another action-adventure mega blockbuster as we saw happen with the 2000 films.	5.0	Luhrmann, McGregor &amp; Kidman Do Their Best Work To Date	2001-06-08	2	2	0

Nicole Kidman is incandescent in her performance as Santine, a dying courtesan who finally has found someone who loves her for her herself.McGregor is spectacular himself and emotes incredibly well as Christian, an idealistic young poet who has fallen in love with the Bohemian lifestyle and with of course Santine.The rest of the cast is unbelievable especially the actor who played Toulouse, he was also Benny Blancho from the Bronx in Carlito's Way. He is a great very overlooked young talent.Moulin Rouge is visually stunning and an emotional rollercoaster with lots of over the top humour and a beautiful love story.

I was mad at the ending. But, I found that I kept thinking about the story. Life was busy, so about a year later I rented the movie, to see if I was remembering it correctly and if I liked it. Same thing. And now, 2 years later... I finally bought it. And, I have to admit that I really do like this movie, but it's different. It's eccentric. It's beautiful. And crazy. And funny. And very romantic. The story underneath everything is so beautiful.And, I just have to say that it's beautiful because we, as women, but also as human beings (male and female alike) were made to love like this. Love deeply, wholly, passionately. That doesn't always happen in life, sadly. But nonetheless, that's what our hearts long for.

It's ""Made to Love"" by tobyMac.I wouldn't recommend this movie for kids, mostly just because of the first few scenes. She is a prostitute in a brothel/night club after all. But, the story is one you'll remember for sure. (But, it's because of those scenes and because of the eccentricness of the movie at times that I make it a 4.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2YVV3TCN3SUMR	Cate	&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; is like no other film you have seen before. It begins in 1900, with a man named Christian(Ewan Mcgregor) in a dark room, sitting at his typewriter. He sits in silence, and then begins to type. He begins to write his story. He begins to write of the Moulin Rouge.The movie tells of how he came to Paris in the summer of 1899, eager to be a part of the Bohemian revolution and follow the loose guidlines of freedom, beauty, truth and above all things, love. He is quickly befriended by a friendly bunch of bohemians, lead by Toulouse Lautrec. The group convinces him to write their new play, &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot; since their previous writer disagreed with his ideas and left. Christian is at first a little uneasy about his new job as the play's writer, but once they get him hooked on the toxic drink &quot;absinthe&quot;, everything gets a little crazy.The bohemians bring Christian to the local, wonderous night club called, &quot;The Moulin Rouge&quot;. It's full of bright and beautiful scenery, ground-breaking music (as I'm sure you've heard, this movie has versions of modern music, from The Beatles to Kiss to Elton John), and amazing dancers. There, he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman), the main dancer and courtesan. Although they get off to a confusing start, the two soon fall madly in love.But, all is not well in their passionate, musical world. The Duke, who is Satine's only shot of being a &quot;real&quot; actress instead of just a dancer, wants her only to himself. She IS, a courtesan, after all.I won't give away what happens at the end (even though you probably guessed who she really loves). I WILL, however, tell you that what makes this movie so special, is just the whole effect of it all. The songs are GREAT because even though the words are familiar, the tunes and way they're put together aren't. There are at least 10 bits of different songs all as one in the song, &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot;. Also, it's a fantasy movie in some ways. During Christian's version of Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot;, he grabs Satine's hand quite unexpectantly, pulls her out the window, and they dance on a cloud while he sings to her. This movie is fast-paced and quite a ride! One minute you're laughing at Nicole Kidman's subtle comedic performance, the next you're being dazzled at the great songs and visuals, and the next you're holding your breath as Satine begins coughing horribly, as she does many times during the movie, but nobody knows why yet (Don't worry, that wasn't a spoiler. They mention it at the very beginning of the movie).I'm afraid my review just can't capture the magic of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. It's so frantically paced (not in an annoying way) through most of it, that I usually notice something new, whether it's an image or even a piece of dialouge. You should rent this movie TODAY! It's abolutely wonderful!	5.0	A bohemian whirlwind of music and fantasy	2003-09-13	1	0	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2309WN97HZZ6N	"Catherine M. Dorkin ""willow100cm"""	I am sure I am one of very few who disliked this movie.  The singing was barely passable, the acting mediocre, and the plot one of the corniest of our time.  What did Moulin Rouge have going for it?  A killer soundtrack and great use of colour.  So, allow me to elaborate.The singing was all wrong.  Ewan McGregor hasn't any talent at all, forcing his falsetto to the max and making it dreadful.  Nicole Kidman has about as much ability in phrasing as I do in my pinkie finger.Kidman can act, as can McGregor, so where was there talent through Moulin Rouge.  I think they were so concerned about masking their poor singing they downplayed their acting talent.  A shame really, as this is what these two persons are first and foremost.The plot was so incredibly hokey.  Boy loves girl; girl loves boy; fakes it.  Does anybody else see Aida revamped into a big-screen colourful display of trashy outfits with contemporary songs?  I would say that the plot became too ornate and took away from the movie.  So much of it was not needed.  Why Nicole Kidman's character sickness?  Like in Aida it is presented to prove true love . . . that should have been forced infront of much of the other plot as it is an intrical part.I enjoyed the colour used, it definetly stated what the Moulin Rouge was all about.  The extreme close-up shots were annoying and far too frequent.  The use of contemporary music was intriguing . . . it actually helped the plot come along.  I made a game of it to see how many I could named.  The use of music in a movie can really express a character in a way he or she cannot express verbally or physically . . . the music chosen somewhat accomplished this.As stated before, I know I am in the minority but, this is my opinion.  This movie had a lot of potential, and it failed.	2.0	Moulin Crud	2003-04-15	10	3	7
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AYJ6P9F8GX9XF	Cecily Champagne	"It was the December before `Moulin Rouge' had hit theaters, and I was reading an article on Nicole Kidman in Vogue.  The journalist was talking about her upcoming film - a musical - , which was described as a cross between `Titanic' and `Rocky Horror Picture Show.'  It was also mentioned that the movie featured renditions of songs as unalike as ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit.""  What?!  I was instantly intrigued.When I got around to seeing `Moulin Rouge' later the next year, it did not disappoint.  I tend to prefer movies that exercise my brain a bit, but this film is such a delight for the senses, that I can forgive its silly characters and trite plot (I'm actually rather grateful for the absence of a unique story - it would have been too distracting).  Another reviewer used the phrase ""eye candy"" to describe `Moulin Rouge' - and that is spot-on.  Director Baz Luhrman uses bright colors, exquisitely audacious costumes, electric lighting, whirling cameras and music-video-like editing to create a sort of ""Modern"" fairytale on acid.  In addition to having somewhat dizzying visual stimulation - `Moulin Rouge' is also an exercise for the ears.  A wide variety of popular music is reinterpreted throughout this film.  Listen closely or you may miss some of the songs (a snippet from David Bowie's ""Diamond Dogs"" escaped me at first).  The anachronistic musical choices, in any case, are quite fun.  On top of all this - `Moulin Rouge' can be rather humorous.  I especially enjoyed the scene where Satine, in a neglige, covers her head in a large fur blanket; aggressively throws herself on the floor; and shouts ""Yes!"" in response to Christian's ""poetry reading.""  Very cute.So, if a sappy little love-story wrapped up in a glittering whirl-wind of color, characters and noise sounds appealing to you, `Moulin Rouge' just might be the ticket.  If you're feeling nauseous just reading my review, I'd forget about this one."	4.0	"""I'm the green fairy!!"""	2006-01-06	7	7	0

Ewan Macgregor and Nicole Kidman are phenomenal in this film, and both deserved Academy Awards for their performances, as did director Baz Leuhrmann.  The story is about the love between Christian, the penniless writer, and Satine, the star of the Moulin Rouge, which is blocked by the duke who desires Satine for himself.  The research that was put towards this film is beyond human belief (along with the accuracy), the bohemian lifestyle is portrayed respectibly, and the movie is an all out 10.  Rent it, purchase it, fall in love with it.  Moulin Rouge is truly the greatest film of all time.	5.0	Greatest movie of all time!	2002-04-01	2	1	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A29IYGR7SNPRIV	"Charlotte Vale-Allen ""writerinresidence"""	I was very reluctant to see this film, primarily because so many people had so many negative things to say about it. But see it I did. And I was astounded at just how good it was. What I find incredible is that the always-frosty Nicole Kidman has garnered all the accolades while precious little has been said about Ewan McGregor. Yet it is McGregor who is the very soul of this film; it is his heartfelt performance that gives the film its depth. On top of that, he can actually sing, and with, again, great feeling.The blending of original tunes written especially for the film (and, shockingly, not nominated for an Academy Award for best song) and previously recorded songs is very powerful--none moreso than the Sting tune, Roxanne, intercut with another number performed as an exquisitely danced, emotionally fraught tango.Director Luhrmann knows his territory and covers it very well indeed. The dance sequences are frantic, even mad; the sets and costumes are brilliant--both in conception and in color. This is a film that fills the senses; there is so much going on, even in the quieter scenes, that it warrants being viewed several times.Particularly powerful is McGregor's climactic scene with the dying Kidman. Here is an actor who endows even the rather asexual Kidman with his own heat.There are a lot of reviews posted with declarations of dislike for this movie. I suspect they were written by people who were expecting to see something like a 1950's MGM musical. Moulin Rouge is a musical for now; a rendering of a classic tale done by the likes of Puccini and Verdi--all variations on La Dame aux Camellias--the naive young man who falls in love with a courtesan only to lose her to consumption.This is very worth seeing. Approached with an open mind, it's a feast for the senses. Highly recommended.	5.0	Remarkably inventive	2002-02-18	12	7	5
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1QBDSJRU3OX1P	cheerio01	I LOVED this movie! Not only was it a huge, fun, campy extravaganza the entire way through, with excellent music to boot, there were things in it that I normally love in theatre or musical productions which most movies seem to lack. For example, the oddity of the cinematogrophy--the dreaminess of some parts, the obvious lip-synching, and other things you may pick up on--are because the entire thing is through the memory of the narrator. Sometimes in a movie you see only what the main character sees; in this one, the bias and fuzziness of memory are added. In a stage when most of what we get from Hollywood seems to ride on action/violence and sexuality and little else (not that this one doesn't have some of both, especially the latter), Moulin Rouge stands out.	5.0	more than meets the eye?	2001-08-10	2	2	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A10FFJ44K8G4Z2	cheese_in_a_can12@yahoo.com	To those of you who were reading the other rviews, the review titled, &quot;PR dept. hard work.....&quot; is completely wrong.  They were not testing for alternate endings.  The whole story is based upon the greek myth of Orpheus.  You can tell by watching the movie that that story is loosely parallel.  Secondly, before I talk about the movie as a whole I will tell you why, I believe there are pop songs in a movie based in Paris during 1900.  In the movie it talks about the Bohemian Revolution.  People that participated in the revolution were called bohemians.  Bohemians wrote in the style, going in the whole idea of the revolution, of reminiscing about youth experiences, making things that were unique and groundbreaking, they tested the edges of acceptability, and rarely, if ever, gave credit to things of the future.  The writers picked Moulin Rouge as the place where the story was set because it was in the past and didn't give them any reason to give credit to a place of the future.  The pop songs are in it because the writers are reminiscing of songs from their youth, even some of its audience's youth.  This combination of pop songs in 1900 tests the edges of acceptability, and it is so well put together that it is unique and groundbreaking.  Now, this movie is so wonderful!  I went and saw this movie even without knowing anything about the plot except Nicole Kidman is a hooker in a nightclub and falls for a penniless writer (Ewan MacGregor).  I think it was much better that way.  The musical numbers are terrific, especially Tango de Roxanne(in which the tension bulids every layer of the song, I had no idea that music could add so much to a movie), and the rendition of Come What May at the end of the movie.  Many people say that the way Nicole and Ewan fall in love is stupid.  They have barely met and Ewan sings Your Song and Nicole falls straight in love with him.  Yeah it's kind of dumb, but hey, all musicals are like that, if you were expecting Silence of the Lambs you're out of luck, but if you were expecting an amazing love story you're in for a treat.  Once you get past when they first fall in love, this movie is a gem!  Those of you who are still skeptical, it is a knid of melodrama, and it's a romance, and it's a tragedy, it's so many things!  I can't really explain it all that much so just go see it!	3.0	The only musical I like!	2001-06-07	4	3	1

When my friend came over on Friday night, she decided it was time we both finally saw it. What a dissapointment.After hearing so much about this movie, I expected much more. Even if I had heard nothing of this movie, I would have found it bad.While both actors are beautiful, that is not enough to make a good movie for me. Some of the songs were good, yes. But I don't buy the idea of their ove. Christian (Ewan) is in love with the idea of love; then, he sees her, the most beautiful woman in the Moulin Rouge, and, surprise surprise, falls in love. She mistakes him for a Duke, he sings her ""Your Song"", and she falls in love. He comes back later, they kiss, they're so in love. The movie continues to show us the couple making out and declaring their love for each other, but when did their love devolpe? Call me unromantic, but I don't buy their ""love at first sight"" exusce. Love does not stand on looks alone. And Satine's sickness seems like a lame exucse for more drama.As for the music, while I understand it was meant to be deep how there's music from the 1990's in a movie taking place in the 1900's, again, I don't buy it. To me, it just seemed out-of-place. Come on, was it really that hard to find a soundtrack for this film?"	1.0	Overrated	2003-05-31	27	16	11

It takes place in the early 1900s in Paris, France. Satine (Nicole Kidman) is a beautiful actress who dreams of making it big and is getting her career started at the Moulin Rouge theatre. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a poor, struggling writer who, when he first meets Satine, falls instantly in love with her. To become famous, Satine's boss will not allow her to fall in love...she must marry the Duke (Richard Roxburgh). But soon after Christian confesses his feelings for Satine, she falls in love with him, too. Now, Satine must hide her love affair from the Duke and her boss before they both find out.Baz Luthrrman has created a masterpiece. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is funny, romantic, upbeat, and tragic. The music fits in well with the film, and the acting is just plain outstanding, especially the performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor...they have amazing on-screen chemistry, as well. The DVD is amazing with tons of extras. There is a behind-the-scenes look at &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, interviews, music videos, a documentary on the music, and so much more. The DVD comes in a wide screen package. Besides being brilliant, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is also one of the most unique films I've seen in a long time.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1ZJJL01LVZQGU	ChiefSanch	I was apprehensive about watching this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The talent is impeccable, the music is exhilirating and sensual and the art direction and cinematography are breathtaking and revolutionary.Ewan McGregor has become one of my favorite actors after he showcased his talents in this star making role, a real breakout performance for him, in my eyes.  His voice is sweet and gentle, very easy and pleasant to listen to.Nicole Kidman is gorgeous.  Her voice is angelic.  Her costumes and make up showed off her gorgeous body and her real commanding presence on the screen.Jim Broadbent is phenomenal in everything he does (Check out Topsy-Turvy).  His vocal talents are wide, from singing to speaking in his over the top and sometimes goofy, if you will, night club owner/emcee character.  He is the best talent in the film and was worthy of a Supporting Actor Oscar.John Leguizamo is the unsung hero of the movie.  He is excellent in almost everything of his I've seen (Check out Romeo + Juliet and To Wong Foo: Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar).The music selections, and the original music, as familiar as you may be with the borrowed song, Smells Like Teen Spirit, Roxanne and everything from Elephant Love Medley, though ridiculously out of time period, fit the situations and scenarios of the moviw beautifully.  The frenzy of the opening number coupled with Smells Like Teen Spirit, the sensuality and mystery and tension of the Roxanne scene and dance and Ewan's desperation and tenacity during the Elephant Love Medley to get the girl.  The music is full of great beats and unforgettable and tunes, stuff that will keep you humming all day long.  I find myself singing some chorus here or there whenever I'm not thinking.The stand out song is Come What May, one of the best original songs from the movie and undoubtedly the best.  It is a beautiful love song and an infectious melody and chorus, both showcased by the surprising vocal talents of Ewan and Nicole.Baz Luhrmann is a genius.  His movies, and now his stage production of La Boheme, are signature Baz.  His use of colors, his ability to tell a good story and a good love story is flawless.  His imagery is comparable to that of Sam Mendes (American Beauty and Road To Perdition).  There is so much going on on the screen that the words don't need to be there.  You can just watch it to get the idea and that is the sign of a great film maker.It's better than Chicago, but didn't get nearly the awards and recognition it deserved.  It reintroduced the genre of the movie musical to the public and Chicago is, in a way, riding it's coat tails.  Moulin Rouge deserves to be mentioned in every same breath as Best Picture Chicago, an excellent film in it's own right.  But MOULIN ROUGE receives my highest recommendation possible!	5.0	Oscar worthy	2003-04-12	2	1	1

One thing all must admit, this film is the most daring and unique film that has come out of the studios in many, many years.To those of you who thought the ending tragic, or if you are viewing the film for the first time, you should watch through the end credits.  The story is barely told through the dialogue.  It is told through emotion and music.  And the music does not stop until the end.  If you follow along with the rest of the Orpheun myth that is Moulin Rouge, it ends with the happiest of endings.  It gives comfort to those who find their true love and then must say goodbye far too soon.If you accept the contract and go for the ride, and if you believe in love, then you'll easily see why this film rises head and shoulders above the rest.	5.0	The most daring movie in years.	2002-10-09	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ARJTTI5BU1MII	Chris	MOULIN ROUGE ROCKS!... Literally!  The music used in the film was made famous by other artists, but they seem completely new when sung by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.  Baz Luhrmann, the director and co-writer, used the lyrics from famous songs by The Beatles, Madonna, Sting, Elton John, Marlyn Monroe, etc., to tell the story and what the characters are thinking.  Unlike some musicals, the songs actually move the plot forward.  The songs are the story.Ewan McGregor (Star Wars Ep. 1) and Nicole Kidman (The Others, AFar Off Place) have excellent, excellent, excellent chemistry in this movie.  Kidman plays a prostitute that never lets herself love anyone because it will interfere with her work.  McGregor plays a boy obsessed with love.  Both of their voices blew me away, especially McGregor's.  I never would've thought that they could pull it off.  I expected Kidman to have a screechy Mariah Carey wannabe voice, but I was very wrong.Baz Luhrmann (director of Romeo and Juliet + Strictly Ballroom) has made an incredible piece of art.  The visuals alone deserve to win a few Oscars, which I'm sure it will.  He has made a movie targeted to the VH1 audience with the MTV effects.  Together they make a stunningly beautiful film.  I was in awe and still am.This movie is a modern classic that is definitely worth the time and money.  Buy it!	5.0	This is more than just a story about love!	2002-01-12	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A37XQ2VE0FCU2E	CHRIS	Baz Luhrmann has taken on Hugo's La Dame Aux Camelias and managed to transform it into a fin de siecle Traviata substituting Verdi's score with a collage of sweet and romantic late 20th century songs. The whole movie has been one of the most OTT camp and indeed operatic overall treatments that has ever been seen on film.  Certainly this movie is more visually stunning than anything I have ever seen before.  The sheer lyrical beauty of the sets, costumes, coreography and especially of Nicole Kidman who is dazzling as Satine are breathtaking.  I have seen this movie three times already and it seems to get better each time you see it.  It has been a long time that any movie so makes you walk out of the theatre wishing you were young and in love.  This is a film that is perfect for those moments when you are feeling a bit blue and sorry for yourself.  I can imagine that there are those who found this film difficult, however I can also imagine that they are those who have never know what it feels like to be in love.  This is not a film that one should review in a cerebral and objective way but one which to enjoy as a feast to the senses.  Beauty truth freedom and love ..... its is all of those things and more	5.0	Baz Luhrmann's Traviata	2001-11-08	2	1	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1377EEY9IJHMU	Christianne	To begin with this movie deserved four stars, but I gave it 5 because a lot of people were giving it one star.I saw something where someone was complaining about the surreal effect, but I think that may have been the desired effect of the movie.My favorite part of the movie is the music.  The blending of turn of the century style and modern pop hits is wonderfully executed.Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor did beautifully both in acting and in singing, who knew either of them could sing so well.  I consider Baz Luhrmann to be an excellent director, and if you liked Moulin Rouge you should also check out Romeo + Juliet.Finally there were several parts of the movie that didn't add up and perhaps they should have been left out (the green fairy scene, particularly), but all in all I do not believe that the movie deserves the harsh ratings I've seen.I guess Moulin Rouge is one of those movies you either love or hate, but I think you also owe it to yourself to watch it.

The first time I went to see it I was both confused and spellbound.  Then I couldn't get the music out of my head, I bought the soundtrack and found only half of the songs from the movie were on it. I was hooked.  Since June 1st I have revisited various theatres to see the movie 5 times.  I never see movies twice none the less 5 times.  This movie is so entertaining I've taken both my little brother, sister, and half of my friends to enjoy this SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR with me.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2MD4U10QSO49C	Christine W. Mangum	Moulin Rouge was one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time.  It is a very unusual movie, but very well done and very enjoyable.  Everything about it is amazing.  Ewan McGregor was awesome, and he did an amazing job singing and portraying emotions.  Nicole Kidman also did a great job, and her singing was very beautiful too.  I had bought the soundtrack before seeing the movie, so I knew that both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were very talented, but watching them sing was great still.  Ewan and Nicole had incredible chemistry and they made the love story so awesome. The story, set, and costumes were also incredible.  I recommend that anyone who sees this movie keeps an open mind, because it is very differnt, very fast paced, and very visually dizzying.  Also realize, that it is a musical.  It was a very well done movie and I hope that it gains the recognition and praise that it truly deserves.	5.0	Incredible!!	2001-06-03	2	1	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AKO0IRSAA95QB	"Christine Wyne ""tall teacher"""	I rarely walk out of movies- but this was one of them.  Yes, the visuals are amazing, creative, overwhelming.  I liked the images of Montmartre 1899, very evocative.  But I couldn't stand the insertion of modern &quot;pop&quot; music like Elton John thrown into the middle of belle epoque Paris- silly lightweight pop verse treated like it is full of deep insight and meaning.  I felt the director thought 21st century audiences would have been bored with more traditional songs of the time- after all we have to keep the audiences stimulated, stimulated with constant edits, movement, visual changes, and yet soothed by familiar pop songs.  The storyline was so predictable, I felt what is the point of remaining in the theater.  I had seen and enjoyed enough of the visuals but that was not enough to keep me.  I lasted 45 minutes, if my husband had been with me, he would have lasted until the first song and would have been out of there!  Switched theaters for &quot;Swordfish&quot; which had the usual death defying car chases, mayhem, and expensive destruction but with a totally mystifying plot.  Have today's directors forgotten the value of a good plot and character development in favor of over the top art and action direction?	2.0	Walked out after 45 minutes	2001-06-22	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3NLH4A3XP4WA5	Christopher Graff	"Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor star in a visually stunning retelling of the classic Moulin Rouge tale. Ewan stars as an aspiring playwright that has come to Paris to make a name for himself when a dazzling actress/prostitute (Kidman) catches his eye when he happens to wander into Moulin Rouge, a berlesque house in 19th century France. They have an affair that is not meant to be. While the film is visually attractive and new age, the content is very thin. I know most fanatics of the film would argue that content is not the prime focus of film's intent and is simply a work of art in motion, I do appreciate that, don't get me wrong. I can justify my rating.  For its overall appeal it is lower on a five point scale-a two, but for its artistic value, a five.  Thus the average is three. It is an ""artsy"" film, sorry for the label, but there is no other way to describe it. I recomend it to true fans of the story or someone interested in seeing theaterlike productions put to film. Traditional movie viewers, beware."	3.0	Stylistically wonderful... not much else	2002-05-24	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2NX99GVAX4TRP	"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover"""	Moulin Rouge almost immediately reminded me of Terry Gilliam's  Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1989).  It's excessively loud, garish, brash theatrical, and full of over-the-top slapstick.  The film also uses the talents of dozens of film technicians to put everything they can afford onto the screen.  The film never quite gets down-right vulgar--but you wonder how far this film will go.  The only clue is that its rated Pg-13... but it seems like it's going to push through that barrier at any moment anyway.  It evokes Keystone Cop slapstick and Allan Carr's (Can't Stop the Music, Broadway's La Cage Aux Folles) excesses sometimes at the same time. It's frenetically edited like an MTV video on speed, but creates such a detailed period opulent fantasy world anyway. It's got the subtlety of a porno-film, but you may just let it run right over you and as you catch you breath decide for all it's faults you like the thing... you really, really like the thing.Moulin Rouge 2001 is a musical by borrowing and twisting,  in sometimes hilariously, sometimes alarming and sometimes unabashedly campy ways, pop music of (mainly) the last thirty years.  What it does with Elton John's Your Song, Madonna's Like a Virgin, Paul McCartney's Silly Love Songs, and The Police's Roxanne is utterly audacious.  If you hold these songs as sacred you will HATE this film.  No, it is not because  all the songs are trashed and ridiculed, sometimes the the tone and attitude of the original song is embraced, though framed differently. Others are definitely turned on their ear.  This idea of mining popular songs to use for a musical is a concept that struck gold in the classic: Singing in the Rain; which only contained a couple of original songs and found several classics to revitalize so successfully as to make them nearly definitive versions.  It's unlikely you'll consider any song performances from this film as definitive versions of the song however.  There's nothing as brilliant as a Donald O'Connor doing the original, Make 'Em Laugh, or as memorable as a Gene Kelly doing Singing in the Rain. Although Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh's Like a Virgin is a number you won't ever forget).  There is however enough energy in every performance and every musical sequence to make you momentarily forget for a while that this film is entertaining but it's an utter mess.The film is a lot like a funny drunken acquaintance whose appeal is infectious if you want it to be, but you know it will eventually wind up tiresome.  There's so much color and cinematic technique on the screen at times you'll feel like Jackson Pollock is splattering film paint at the screen but its not being splattered with hate or anger or contempt.  There's nary a drop of cynicism anywhere in this film and I think anyone who claims the film displays any kind of condescension or contempt for the audience is bringing too many pre-conceived notions into the theater with them.  The movie begs to please the audience in its own giddy over-the top way. Of course the truly cynical will hate it for just that reason.Intentions, energy and spirit are only part of what makes for a successful film experience. Unfortunately for all the go for broke excess and inspired lunacy the film embraces completely in its first hour, by the film's last forty minutes or so, it decides to actually concentrate on its melodramatic plot and corny sentimental love triangle to deliver an overly familiar poignant message about love.  It buckles down and stops throwing everything but the kitchen sink at you. For a little while it concentrates on trying to breath new life into the chestnut of a plot it has saddled itself with by coming up with a couple of minor twists, which feel more repetitious than clever.  The film tries desperately to find a way to cleverly thrust its plot and resolution at us.  We already know exactly where it is going, and pro-longing it doesn't help.  As the film gets quieter, we're reminded how exhausted we are by what we've seen.Though it's actually a failure this is a film made by people who love not only what they do, but also what film has done in the past. They celebrate their love and passion for film by updating and partially re-inventing the movie musical.  Purists be damned.As over-done as the film was in the movie theaters... so is the DVD.  The image on the disc is impressive, the sound quality a little less than perfect, but the extras are piled on.... and there's even easter eggs to find for even more.You can watch the film with the BEHIND THE RED CURTAIN FEATURE which will reval a series of short vignettes that cover the film's production design and special effect features.  There is even a deleted scene complete with commentary. When a green fairy appears in the corner of the screen, viewers can watch the additional eight segments (which add up to about 23 minutes) and then return to that point in the film when the segment is finished.  It's like the Infini-film features another studio has.  Two feature length commentaries tell how the film was made and then another how it was written.  Exhaustive.. yes... interesting... actually very much so.Disc 2 is loaded with extras of interest to those who truly enjoy this film.  There's not enough room to even quickly describe allthat you get.  If you like the film even a little bit, you'llfind this disc worth getting.  If you are curious about the film, there's bound to be some features here that you'll find interesting even if you wind up not liking the film very much.Christopher Jarmick, is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2EB4UWZILO23P	"Christopher Volkerts ""on the curve"""	I saw Moulin Rouge for the first time on DVD and could just kick myself for missing the theatrical release. Although it appears to be a 'love it' or 'hate it' experience, I am amazed at how much I love this film. This is a daring update on the musical form, and one which is astoundingly effective. I always believed the singing, I always accepted that yes indeed, those feelings, that moment, could only be expressed by bursting into song. Are these broadway-style belters? Nope, and the movie is all the better for it. The voices are not bad, but not great. They are the voices we think we have as we sing in the shower. At times too breathy, too shrill, not supported -- but always honest and pleasant. The combinations of songs and musical moments is the musical as it would be if we all actually lived in a musical, snippets of popular songs joining together in unexpected ways to form the soundtrack of our feelings. I thought the acting was fabulous, Nicole Kidman (who I haven't really liked in anything since Dead Calm) is a revelation. Ewan Magregor is terrific as always, and Jim Broadbent menacing and touching. Richard Roxburgh, as the evil duke, is a fascinating mix of Gary Oldman and Snidely Whiplash in a wonderfully over-the-top performance. Even through the flash of the film, what I remember are the wonderfully human small moments -- Nicole's reaction the first time Ewan starts to sing; Ewan battling back sobs as he angrily thanks Nicole for &quot;curing him of his silly infatuation with love&quot; the moments when Nicole puts on her prostitute emotional armour to avoid her true feelings -- astounding work. I can't recommend this movie more highly a thrilling and challenging experience that you will come back to again and again.	5.0	Thrilling and Challenging - what more can you ask for?	2001-12-28	0	0	0

Its like the director had alot of creative ideas and instead of trying to create a plot, he just crammed all of these ideas and creative scenes into a movie!

I had no expectations before seeing this movie and was blown away.The plot? Who cares? I have now seen it four times and plot makes no difference as each time I take in the splendour of the Moulin Rouge, the wonderful music and the perfect performances. The set is fantastic, and a great shame it has been destroyed as it is the heart of the movie. The music draws on the classics of the 20th Century - everything from Freddie Mercury to Madonna, is made over in the Luhrmann style. Finally the actors are perfect in the roles, the two standouts being Ewan McGregor, both in fine voice and looking ever the dashing hero and Jim Broadbent, the underrated British actor, who almost steals the movie from its leads with his eccentric version of &quot;Like A Virgin (you have to see it to believe it!!) As for Ms Kidman, she is also very good and Mr Cruise will be ruing his decision to leave her after seeing this (which I hope he does).Go and see this movie - it is brilliant, outstanding, unbelievable - go and see it!	5.0	Absinthe-Soaked Hallucinogenic Dream	2001-07-21	5	5	0

Note: this movie is definitely a chick flick! I don't know a single guy who actually enjoys this movie thoroughly as most women who watch it do!  However, I have known a few guys to sit through the movie.  It is a great piece of work by Baz Luhrman (i'm not sure if that is spelled right).	5.0	GREAT!	2003-07-01	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AZ5250G2U795I	C. K. Ogi	This movie is definitely a feast for the eyes.  But, with Luhrman's style, you either love him or hate him, I've discovered.  The visuals are eye popping and transport you into a world that is a real as it is dreamy.The story, too, is actually pretty good.  It reminded me of the big budget MGM musical's of early Hollywood...completely lavish and full throttle entertainment.  The different use of old and new music was also a breath of fresh air I initially thought I would hate, but found it worked well for this film.That being said, aside from sets and costumes, I didn't see anything in this film that would have it merit best picture nods.  I enjoyed it, but don't agree that it was one of the best films of 2001.  It is odd, endearing, and different, and I recommend it for just pure entertainment with little intellectual investment.	3.0	Visually Amazing!	2002-10-28	3	3	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	"Clarissa ""MoonGoddess"""	Like most people I was really skeptic upon seeing this movie. The trailer didn't look too promising so I waited for it to come out on DVD and decided to rent it instead. At first it didn't seem like it was going to be much of anything but once it got going it simply blew me away. Upon viewing you'd never imagine this movie to be as deep as it is. On all parts the acting is magnificant and the singing is easy to follow yet gorgeously breath-taking. They use classic songs like The Sound Of Music while also blending more modern songs ranging from Nirvana to Madonna to Lamb. I was also quite impressed to know that all the actors used their own voices instead of lip singing to professionals. Honestly, though, they all have amazing voices. You'd never once think that they were inexperienced. I mean, where in the world has Nicole Kidman been hiding? She's a much better singer than Jennifer Lopez yet she's so overlooked. Anyways, I especially enjoyed the hindu dance sequence towards the end with Nicole singing &quot;Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend&quot; in a very modern fashion. And while all this may seem a tad eccentric it all works quite well together.This movie certainly deserves many oscars, including best picture. It's got comedy, romance, suspense, obsession, jealousy, love, confusion...while all remaining light and humerous. So the jest of this story is about how a popular courtisan (Nicole Kidman) whom entertains in the famous Moulin Rouge is caught between following her heart by staying with the man she loves (Ewan McGregor) whom is a writer in poverty or by following her dreams of marrying a wealthy Duke whom has promised to make her a star...The DVD is much better than the VHS for it includes a lot of extra features such as behind-the-scenes footage as well as interviews with the stars and muscisians. You can also click on your favorite songs and dance scenes without having to rewind or fastforward like you would with the VHS. So if you haven't seen this movie yet than I suggest you do, even if you strongly beleive that this is going to be a silly musical.P.S. - The ending will shock you greatly.	5.0	The Best In A Looooong While	2002-02-27	8	5	3

The movie had no actual premise.  I also didn't get why they tried to tell the story of impressionist-era artists using trite 20th century pop lyrics.  I got about 3/4 of the way through the movie and finally called it quits when I realized the movie was really going nowhere.  This is the kind of mindless, ADD-causing crud that epitomizes MTV these days.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.	1.0	Worse than Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band	2004-12-18	24	11	13

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AE2KCASMQPMO	"C. Meja ""CMM"""	There is no doubt for me about this statement: Moulin Rouge was the best movie of 2001. An orpheus-like story told with pop music and visual enlightment. I know many people didn't like it, but there is no question about this: this movie is spectacular, deep, emotional, ironic... it's an encyclopedic mix of genres and influences. Nicole Kidman gave a wonderful performance. I was surprised by the beautiful tone of her voice, almost liric. Ewan McGregor's voice is pretty acceptable as well, and his acting is spotless: his development from a naive eye-wide-opened youngster to a depressed, beard and isolated mature guy is outstanding. The comedy works just as well as the tragedy. The music is wonderful and the dance numbers are really great. All of this coming from a person who hates musicals... that's just how good this movie is. Go along with Christian in his way to conquer Satine's heart only to find out that the social conditions she has been living in for years are imposible to erase... the scars of the lies are in her very breath and the miserable conditions of her life (hidden behind sparkling dresses and oppresive cors&eacute;s) have left a tragic fate. Christian, unaware of this, writes a play to turn the Moulin Rouge into a theater, a house of art... but to accomplish this he, Satine and Harold Zidler (Moulin Rouge's owner) must put everything in the Duke's hands. Then Satine must play the duke's heart, so the transformation of this place into an art temple can go on. How long can the affair between the writer and the performer stay in the shadows without the producer noticing? The fight between Apollo and Dioniosios and their rituals shown in a new way: the romance (as an artistic genre) is born after this fight in the which none of the previous ones survive. It's melancholic, yet spectacular... it's idealistic, yet quite mundane. In years people will hardly remember A beautiful Mind, but Moulin Rouge will become a classic.A plus reason for having this movie is its perfect DVD release. I can say this is the BEST DVD I have. There are a lot of extras and phantom pills. There are music videos, outtakes, different versions of some scenes and multiple angles of the dance sequences, etc. And the look of the menus and the box is just beautiful. The truth is that this is also the best DVD release of 2001.	5.0	A perfect approach to the fight between Apollo and Dionisio	2002-04-28	5	4	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AVSHGTFRZB37L	C. Murphy	"I had high hopes for this movie.  I had heard how great it was, how great the cast was, how great the music was, etc.  What I got was a completely unoriginal movie.It was yet another boy meets girl, girl can't be with boy since she's forced to be with someone else.  Perhaps they were trying to capitolize off of the success of movies like ""The Princess Bride,"" which had the same theme (though far from the same plot.)  To make it even less original, the songs are not even there own.  Most of them are ..of popular songs.I stuck with it though.  I kept watching thinking that soon it would all make sense.  Perhaps at the end someone would wake up and talk about how that was the weirdest dream they'd ever had.  Something like that.  But no.  At the end the viewer is left wondering, ""is that it?""  I remember back to scenes such as when some guy with a gun gets tackled, the gun flies out the window and hits the Eifel Tower.  I'm sorry, but did I miss some sort of strange symbolizim here?In the end I was left with the same feeling I get when I have too much Pop-Rocks and Rootbeer.  Just another foamy, queezy stomach ache.The only reason for people liking this movie that I could think of was peer pressure.  All the reviewers talked about how great it was, some artsy-fartsy people said it was great, and then it was a great game of telephone until the majority of people liked it.  Fight peer pressure people.  Don't be afraid to say how boring this movie was.I pray they don't make a sequel."	1.0	Unoriginal!!	2003-04-30	9	4	5
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2GCHG6U8HTVIT	C. O. DeRiemer	"Lavish and lush, but also pointless, full of camp and without wit. It seemed to me to be an adolescent's idea of sophistication. The direction was frenetic and I assume Luhrmann was aiming for an eccentric, romantic, funny style. For me, he didn't come close. The use of more-or-less contemporary popular songs just seemed to be ""nudge, nudge"" and unfunny. The dancing as well as the setups for the singing seemed clunky. The can-can sequence was all over the place; check out Renoir's French Cancan to see how a bawdy, rowdy can-can should be staged. Kidman has always seemed to me to be a somewhat cold, self-possessed actress. I was surprised at how loosened up she was here. Luhrmann was so good with Strictly Ballroom, where he used the same elements of exaggeration, talking directly to the camera, lush photography and a distinct style to great effect. You could almost see him pushing everything way to the brink with Moulin Rouge. This was a real disappointment."	3.0	Luhrmann Is Capable Of Doing So Much Better	2005-01-15	14	6	8

I understand that it's a movie that you'll either love or hate, but I think everyone should love this movie! It was nominated for 8 Oscars, and it should have won them all. It CAN be a desperate cry for Ritalin at times, but that's the artistic style of the movie. Personally, I think the whole thing is brilliant, the stars can sing, and the dance numbers are inspired. The especially great numbers are &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot; &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds/Come What May.&quot; These moments are movie magic, and it's a rare person who can't enjoy it on some level.

I'm definitely in the &quot;love&quot; category.  I think to truly appreciate this movie you have to let go of some preconceptions you might have about musicals or period pieces.  This movie plays outside of any boundaries or genres you'll try to put it into.  That will definitely frustrate a lot of people who want to put it in a box and label it.  I was absolutely entranced by everything in this movie.  The visuals, the music, and especially the performances by Nicole and Ewan are all so full of energy and life that I couldn't help but have a stupid grin on my face through most of the movie.

She had already seen it before and had warned me that the first 20 minutes or so are a bit 'freaky'.Well I thought it was great.  I love musical theater and because I went into the movie theater with an open mind I didn't feel the need to compare it with actual stage musical theater or with life time skilled/trained theatrical/opera singers.I thought Ewan and Nicole sang pretty darn good, the new songs were very moving and the old songs were given a breath of fresh air.I hope I can get my friend to the theater to see it before it goes to video!

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1V8165KGQ2BYE	Cookies	Watching this film I kept thinking about how the lines between music videos and film have been crossed. The camera work, editing and sappy use of POP tunes in a turn of the century movie all convey the feeling that the director thinks we are stupid.  IF the move had been shot with NEW songs, written for the film, it could have been a wonderful movie.  But the director seemed to think that we, the audience would become confused and possible bored by this.  What to do?  Use pop songs we ALL know!  Rather than take a risk, Baz took the easy road. Much like those TV ads that uses a pop song to sell soap, this movie uses pop songs to sell itself. Why try and be original when you can buy it?  Moulin Rouge falls into a new category of film, Ultra-culture!  Where words, time, music, colors and editing build a world all it's own.  The end result is a story we can see coming a mile away, music we all know and editing we have all seen before.  If this movie had taken more risks I would have liked it more.  As it stands now, it's a commercial for itself.  A movie totally lacking in any depth other than it's love for what it is, pretty.	1.0	A commercial for itself	2002-01-31	9	5	4

Styled like a hyper MTV music video, the actors behave like demented live action Warner Brother's cartoons. Did no one tell them that only cartoon characters can get away with this?While Baz Luhrman excels in tragic stories, he has no comic sensibilities. In the first part of the movie he strains to be comic, and each of these hyper comic moments falls flat and took me out of the story. Strangely the commentary suggests that this was his intent!? Though their mantra was ""everything in the service of the story,"" they did a lot of other things visually and musically in the first half that completely distracted from the story.Having a strong urge to leave, but remembering the astonishing final scene in his Romeo + Juliet, I hung in there hoping to catch a few visual gems. About half way though the movie my patience finally paid off, and it began to take the story seriously and become an astonishing work of cinematic art. I was completely swept away by the story, and everything worked in complete service to the story, I mean everything from the acting, dancing, singing, cinematography and editing.In the end I absolutely loved it, but it was also the worst movie ever. To reconcile my love and revulsion for this movie, I've split the movie in half.

I have never seen, nor expect to see, a movie that fills you with so much raw emotion again.  Maybe ""Moulin Rouge"" wasn't quite as good as that, but it's pretty high up there on the pedestel.  Simply put, I loved this movie.  I loved the music, I loved the dancing, I loved the acting, and I really loved the story.  This is not my first film by this director.  I also own ""Romeo and Juliet"".  From this previous movie, I knew ""Moulin Rouge"" would be a little out there- I think that really helped the story.  This movie was very sad, and I would have LOVED a happier ending. However, I understand that that probably would have been predictable- and that just wouldn't have been ""Moulin Rouge"".  So go out it and buy.  Maybe it isn't exactly what you think you'd enjoy, but trust me, this is another one of those ""unforgettable"" movies.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A51IK68MWKV5R	"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies"""	This is an event!  Baz Luhrmann (director of William Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet, a film that, while I didn't like, I admired for its advancement of the form) has made a thoroughly modern musical set in 1899 (no easy feat) using pop songs as the primary medium.  The much-talked-about singing talents of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are, at least on first viewing, passable enough for this film.  Plus, they lend a natural feel to the characters, as if you or I were singing (with our less-than-trained voices) to a loved one.The story is not what's important here, it is the spectacle.  This could have easily given the title of the production within--Spectacular Spectacular--because obviously Luhrmann was reaching for this and he succeeds.I listened to some of the songs on the soundtrack and found that they did not have the same effect I had experienced without the accompanying visuals.  I would hazard a guess that a second viewing would not hold the same enthrall as the first, introductory, overwhelming, oh-my-god-ness of the first.

I immediatly bought the soundtrack and have all the songs memorized!  But what I love most about the movie would have to be Nicole Kidman. Me and my best friend are absolutley in love with her.  She is my idol! She's gorgeous, a talented actress, a loving mother, and a talented singer.  If it weren't for this movie, the world might never have discovered the singing star in Nicole.  The plot shows that love can prevail through anything.  The best line is how Christian, Ewan McGregor, lives his life: &quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.&quot;  I saw the movie for a second time, and the ending of the movie still made me cry.

I suppose being used to his style made it easier for me to fall in love with the film, viewers seem to either love it fiercely or hate it with a passion.As others have mentioned, the story is simple yet touching. The score is amazingly blended into the film's musical numbers and it's nearly impossible not to find yourself singing along in your repeat viewings. Watch out for Ewan McGregor's sudden outbursts of song, they're beautiful and breathtaking. He plays his role exceptionally well, his face perfectly capturing that of the innocent man untouched by the cruel machinations of Love.

But after listening to many glowing reviews and recommendations, I watched Moulin Rouge and was baffled.For the first 30 minutes I was just flat out confused as to what the director was ""going for."" Then about 30 minutes into it, I thought it was supposed to be a satire. But after 45 minutes or so, the whole idea of this film began to wear a little thin. The whole ""Hey, we've moderized some old songs and turned some modern ones into show tunes"" really began to grate on my nerves. The renditions of ""Like a Virgin"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" were especially...well, stupid.I'll give them an ""A"" for creativity, but avoid this one if you can."	1.0	I guess I just don't get it.	2002-03-04	35	21	14

All of it set to a visually bombastic series of vignettes which is nothing if it isn't post 20th century hollyweird.  Period piece? forget about it.  A bastardization and a not very entertaining one, you got it.  The only thing entertaining was the rapid pace which left you wondering what it was you'd just seen.  And then you realize that it doesn't matter cause nothing about it hangs together nor was it intended to.Since I do know something and I'm no longer in school it was a complete waste of 16 bucks.	1.0	Soundbites ala carte	2001-07-07	8	2	6

But, I have seen this movie twice now and Baz has done it again. His prior two films, Strictly Ballroom and Romeo & Juliet, are also huge favorites of mine and Moulin Rouge is simply the best movie I have seen this year.Sure the music seems hokey at first but once you truly listen it actually all makes sense.Ewan & Nicole amazed me with their singing as well as Nicole's acting talent was much better than some of the other things I've seen.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1NLLX3IZAQUFI	CyberLouis	A few years ago, Ewan McGregor appeared in a critically acclaimed film called &quot;Little Voice&quot;.  Surprisingly, the title did not refer to him.  Little Voice was the name of the film's very shy, soft-spoken star, who when inspired could imitate the great divas (eg, Judy Garland.)  In Little Voice, Ewan did not sing.  After sitting through Moulin Rouge, I can understand why.  Ewan, though one of the best actors of our time, cannot sing.That said, it is obvious what the biggest problem is with Moulin Rouge.  Although Director Baz Luhrmann creates one of the most colorful, original movies in years, he fails to recognize that musicals need singers.  Moulin Rouge has great musical arrangements, a great choice of diverse music, and cleverly moves from one selection to another.  However, all of this is marred when Ewan, co-star Nicole, or any of the other cast members open their mouths.  None of them can sing.  They are downright awful.  The only decent voice in this film is ... The MOON.  (In one of the film's cutest moments, The Moon begans to sing opera in the background.)Speaking of little voices, Nicole Kidman has the tiniest voice I have ever heard.  Though an accomplished actress, Nicole only inspires laughter when she tries to lead songs in this movie.  And as beautiful as she looks, Nicole also oversteps her bounds by trying to do one of Marilyn Monroe's signature numbers, Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend.  Though Nicole's version has more dancers, more extras, more orchestra, more whatever, it doesn't have Monroe's ebullience, sex appeal or, for that matter, her voice.As we watched the DVD, we kept laughing at Ewan's howls, Nicole's whispers, and at the other vocally-challenged cast members.  When it was over, all we could say was, &quot;What were they thinking?&quot;	1.0	Little Voice At the Moulin Rouge	2001-12-25	97	11	86

The acting, singing, and choreography are breath-taking.The DVD provides bonus features such as music videos, the HBO Making feature, and a Behind the Red Velvet Curtain version to learn about the history and technology.Although it's a sad movie, it's invigorating to watch and provides an inspiring theme of truth, beauty, freedom, and most of all LOVE!	5.0	A Movie Musical Experience!	2001-12-29	0	0	0

The overly-frenetic style of the editing spoiled all of that to a major extent.  Even the opening number, a creative melding of the songs &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; and &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; had the camera whizzing around much too rapidly for it to be enjoyable.  The plot was choppy and just plain silly.  The character development was non-existant.  The volume on the dialogue was often too soft, and the volume on the songs was often painfully loud.Ugh!  Sheer torture!  If I hadn't gone with someone I would have walked out 10-20 minutes into the film.  I sent an e-mail panning this movie to my friends, and I got back two immediate responses that they, too, wanted to leave early but sat through the entire horrid mess.	1.0	Pure torture!	2001-06-16	17	6	11
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A28WJUJF6D2ULA	Dai-keag-ity	Nicole Kidman has never looked lovelier and Ewan MacGregor has never seemed purer of heart in this imaginative, touching, visually-explosive production from 2001. Some have cited Bollywood's influence on this musical, all I know is this is a brave, quirky movie that works to perfection and tells a story only someone dead of soul could fail to fall for. Set in 1890's Paris and told in flashback (as with 1999's American Beauty, within moments you soon forget you are seeing a flashback and almost discard the fact you are watching a great tragedy unfold) Moulin Rouge imparts its love story between a beautiful showgirl and innocent writer, and does it among some of the most intense sights and sounds ever caught on film. And the soundtrack, which mingles modern music with tunes from the past, has to be heard to be believed. The cast---both the characters and the modern actors who portray them---is terrific, and director Baz Luhrmann pulls few punches in bringing life to this eccentric story of truth, beauty, freedom, and love. Moulin Rouge is a movie everyone who is anyone will probably want to see at some point, and it has never looked better than in this widescreen DVD release.	5.0	A Film Of Great Imagination	2007-07-13	3	3	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3NQ9N2OO60JGP	Dale E. Hopkins, II	I had the fortunate experience of seeing this film on opening day. There really weren't too many people in the theatre as &quot;the buzz&quot; hadn't yet begun. There were a few MTV kids there hoping to catch a glimpse of their fave pop icons singing &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; (boy- THEY were disappointed) and some other folks who were, most likely curious about the film they had seen advertised in the theatre lobbies for nearly 6 months prior to its opening. I was there because I had heard this was a trippy homage to movie musicals and was very stylised.What I saw was something I had never seen before and will, no doubt, ever see again. Baz Luhrmann, who is apparently THE expert on pop culture, managed to take a very simple story of forbidden love and turn it into a dizzying swirl of emotions and song. One minute you are laughing hysterically at the antics of Lautrec (Leguizamo) and his band of Bohemians and the next crying with the lovers Christian and Satine (McGregor and Kidman).The performances are brilliant and played broadly. There is so much convention from the late 19th and early 20th centuries used in this film : the cityscapes look like stereoscope images; the jerkiness, exaggerated speed of motion and random flickering of light recalls the silent film era. Sure there is an air of camp about this, but EVERYTHING here, sonically and visually, has been taken to the extreme to convey the many moods expressed throughout. At times it is almost as if turn of the century theatre had been somehow captured on film.This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen and it stuck with me throughout the course of the summer. I couldn't wait for the DVD edition to be released and felt that it would probably arrive just before the Holiday Season. I was correct in my guess. The DVD comes with a pristine widescreen presentation of the film. It also comes with a second disc that features the &quot;bonus material&quot;. This &quot;bonus material&quot; includes production concepts, initial edits of key scenes, the videos for &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; (as well as the live performance from the MTV Awards) and the trance-house single mix of &quot;Come What May&quot;. There is also the standard &quot;making-of&quot; featurette and production notes.The packaging is beautiful. It includes many photos, pieces of artwork and architecture from the film in a tri-fold digipak. This tri-fold is packaged inside a gorgeous embossed slip case (the image you see pictured for this item). The &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; DVD is truly an exceptional item that belongs in any person's home film library.	5.0	La Nouvelle Classique! C'est &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;	2001-12-19	1	1	0

Throwing convention to the wind, he managed to give us glimpses into the energy and excitement created by the legendary Moulin Rouge and married it to an engaging fairy tale -- punctuated with pop music. You haven't seen anything like it!The movie is full of surprises (i.e. the stars doing their own singing), which makes the movie more endearing. The costumes are STUNNING, the set designs, choreography and editing are pure fun. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman affect the right combination of innocence, campiness and elegance to make you want to watch this one over and over.When I saw Moulin Rouge on the big screen, I immediately decided that I'd have to have the movie in my collection.

It not only has a wonderful soundtrack (done very well by Kidman and McGregor) but it is also funny, dramatic, and everything else that makes a movie a winner.  I would suggest that is you go to see this movie, you go in with an open mind, because it isn't your &quot;average&quot; movie..it has a lot of new and different ideas, but that is, I think, what makes this movie so wonderful.

I was completely blown away and am sad that I only got to see it three times in a movie theatre.  I have since seen it countless times on my DVD player. :DThere are so many things I love about this movie that it's difficult to put into a string of coherent sentences.  The colors, oh, the colors!  Luhrmann uses color effectively to try and emphasize the atmosphere.  He fades them out when things are bleak and brings them in to an almost life-like vibrancy when emotions swell.  It's as if he taps into your imagination and makes the world a brighter (or darker) place like you were right there with the characters.Then there was the music.  In using established works, Luhrmann drew some criticism from those who love traditional opera/musicals, but I thought it worked.  It's the words he's after.  By using popular songs, I didn't have to spend too much time trying to figure out the lyrics.  Instead, I focused on how the words fit the scene.  The effect was even better when the actors sang and I was delighted to find that they had singing talent.  I was surprised that Kidman had such a strong, almost old-fashioned type of voice.  McGregor melts hearts with his crooning voice; you feel it when he's in pain and feel warm when he sings of love.For lovers of the movie, the DVDs will delight.  The bonus disc is filled with all sorts of goodies including many easter eggs, production and design notes, behind the scenes looks at the dancing and music, and a plethora of other things.An over the top movie?  Maybe.  Silly?  Definitely.  But isn't that how it goes when you're in love?	5.0	Delightful movie, excellent DVD presentation	2002-07-16	5	5	0

It looked cheesy to me, but I kept hearing good things about it.  So finally I went, and was blown away.  This movie, from a writing aspect, breaks no new ground, but visually,it is astonishing.  The beautiful thing about film is that the same story can be told over and over in different styles.  And Baz Luhrman's style is most definitely unique.  The movie pulls you in from it's opening moments, and rarely lets go.  I did find the movie slightly over-indulgent at times, as though Baz was throwing certain visual effects in for the sake of throwing them in.  But the acting all around is incredible, and the music is absolutely genius.  Many may have a problem with what could be describe as a 2 hour music video, but I loved it.  It is definitely geared towards the MTV generation, but I think it can be enjoyed by all.

Fincke ""thegreatfandincke"""	This movie, which begins go gaudily and with an unparalleledly jumbled mishmash feeling that it sent more people than I've ever seen walking out during the first half hour, turns increasingly serious, focused, and, above all, passionate.Despite a cartoonish character or two and a series of musical sequences which manage to be off in a variety of different ways--- almost always with the volume turned down too low (which is odd given the volume of the visuals) and always with a kitch anachronistic flair that only occasionally works, this movie tunrs out to be rather emotionally charming, compelling, and in the end, tragically satisfying.  The script is for the most part quite clever in pulling off farce, tragedy and romance and manages to give the audience just enough information in the beginning to foreshadow part of the impending emotional tone of the end---we are told right off that she will die, and yet we do not know the circumstances which are to color that death.Much like in American Beauty, there is such a wonderful dramatic and emotional tension and curiosity built in when the fate is known but not its cause.  It is as though the knowledge of death turns one's attention away from how things must end to looking to see how we can feel about what goes before the end.  It feels like a dramatization of our own condition when we see our deaths as inevitable and turn our attention not to where we will end up, for there there is no happy ending, but rather to how we will live in the meantime, for in the end, &quot;all men die but not all men really live...&quot; to quote a film starring a different aussie.  Anyway, not to wax to existentially, the sense of tension is spectacular when you know it ends badly but not how.  Normally one knows the bad guy simply will lose.  But here we know she will die, does that mean that the bad guy might win?And Kidman is beautiful, as always in more ways than one.  So emotionally captivating.  Ewan McGregor also does a fine job here.In the end, this felt like Shakespeare in Love as it would have been had it not been written as one big inside joke for literary people who get to feel all excited by jokes because they are the only ones who understand them and who then acclaim the movie because of how good they felt leaving the theatre.  Despite the obvious similarities to &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; in love triangle, passionate romance of youth, playful revisionism and the crossings of art and love, this film exhibits a vision of love with quite a bit more depth than the sex and rhetorical prowess that seemed all the &quot;true love&quot; of &quot;shakespeare in love&quot; seemed really to be about at bottom.  This film's praise of love has more gravity and credibility for more closely sticking with Shakespeare and the classical tragedians' sense of the power of tragedy, amidst its comedy and revelry.  How almost Dionysian...All in all, quite a satisfying film despite being musically hit and miss.	4.0	Shakespeare In Love Done Right	2001-08-22	0	0	0

Although I disagree with her proclimation of &quot;best movie ever&quot; I cannot deny the artistic inginuity that this film is drowning in, in fact, this strength may also be it's greatest flaw. The movie is sometime awekwardly paced and the cinimatography, while brilliant is at times odd and almost as nautious as the Blair Witch Project. Despite over doing it in artistic appeal the film is beautifully colred, and coreographed. For the casual movie gower it may be easy to loose track of the story at times, but for movie buffs like myself the over all brilliance and depth of this movie makes it a definate must own. Although I must confess that if this movie had hoped to breathe new life into the dead musical genre it would have been better if they had used original music, not bizzar remakes of classic pop/rock tunes.	4.0	A fast pace and crazy loveable film	2002-03-20	2	1	1

I heard so many bad things about it, but I wanted to see it all for myself.  It starts dark and creepy, becomes fast and energetic and ends like a roller coaster.  You are sorry it ended because it was so exciting, you want to get back on and do it again, but you know the ending and wish you could do it again for the first time, and be innocent of the ending.  The soundtrack was lovely (except for that non-explainable Top 40 single) but it becomes even more poignant and touching after you watch the movie.  A previous review stated this is a movie to see with a date, which is true, but I think you should pay full attention to the colors, sounds and dialogue.  Wrap yourself up in them.  Ignore the person sitting next to you.  Forget all the crazy things happening in the world today.  I recommend this movie to anyone who believes that every movie is copied from another.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3A7CBLO6JGY4F	"Daniel Garris ""YoSoyTylerDurden"""	"I could go on and on about Moulin Rouge, as it is one of my all time favs, but don't have the space to do so here.  The following is thus some exerts from a paper I wrote on Moulin Rouge shortly after its release.  The paper attempts to uncover and discuss what I feel Moulin Rouge is truly about.Moulin Rouge is an exquisite example of a film that deals with a number of concepts that are highly important within the postmodern world.  Quite simply, one of the key components of Moulin Rouge, and possibly the main theme of the film, is its questioning and reaffirming of the value of art within a postmodern culture.  According to Jean Baudrillard in his essay ""After the Orgy"":""When everything is political, nothing is political any more, the word itself is meaningless.  When everything is sexual, nothing is sexual any more, and sex loses its determinants.  When everything is aesthetic, nothing is beautiful or ugly any more, and art itself disappears.""Within the postmodern realm described by Baudrillard, art no longer has the value it once did, and whether or not it even has any value at all is a valid question.  Moulin Rouge plays on this key notion of postmodern thought throughout the film, as it constantly questions this viewpoint.  In order to do so, a number of classic pop-songs are recycled within the construction of the film. The songs (two important examples being ""Your Song"" by Elton John and ""Silly Love Songs"" by Wings) are present not only for nostalgic and emotional purposes, but for master-narrative purposes as well, as it is through the use of such songs that the film does its questioning of the post-modern.  The songs (which are almost all directly connected to love) are obviously portrayed as still being important based on the lyrics that have been chosen.  The most prolific example of this occurs in the medley sequence of the film in which Christian and Satine sing the following songs from ""Silly Love Songs"":""You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love longs.  But I look around me and I see it isn't so.  Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs.  And what's wrong with that?  I'd like to know.""Because they play such an important role in the film, the referenced songs, must be seen as advocating that love songs (and on a greater level, the notion of art itself) still have value today within the post-modern realm.  Moulin Rouge can thus be seen as attempting to discredit the post-modern ideal at hand.Yet, at the same time in reconstructing pieces of old songs for a new purpose, the film also employs one of the key aspects of postmodernism.  Because Moulin Rouge references and recycles so many ideas, it is in its construction a very post-modern film. Moulin Rouge is thus a postmodern film (in theme and in construction) that in some ways discredits one of the key driving notions behind postmodern thought (that art is dead) at the same time through its narrative choices.****, (10/10)"	5.0	A few of my thoughts on Moulin Rouge	2004-05-27	5	3	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	"I absolutely love Moulin Rouge.  I have never seen anything at all like this movie; it is nothing short of indescribable.  Previews and descriptions offer only the smallest glimpse into the epic world of intense human emotion, amazing sets, and incredible music that is Moulin Rouge.  The setting is Paris in 1900, where the Moulin Rouge is the place to be, a spectacularly unreal world wherein inhibitions are left at the door and beauty, truth, freedom, and love are pursued on an epic scale.  Ewan McGregor plays Christian, a young, idealistic, penniless poet who has come to Paris to embrace the bohemian spirit flourishing there.  He soon finds himself writing songs for a lavish production alongside a truly unforgettable cast of characters led by Toulouse Lautrec (John Leguizamo).  His new friends are awestruck by the lines and lyrics he comes up with, all of which are drawn from the pop culture of our own modern day.  A shot of absinthe and a vision of the Green Fairy (played by the lovely Kylie Minogue) later, he finds himself inside Moulin Rouge.  Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) leads the way for one of the most lavish musical production numbers ever created on film, topped off by the appearance of Satine (Nicole Kidman) on a huge swing above the amazingly enthusiastic audience.  Despite the odds, Christian and Satine fall in love, but they must keep their love hidden because the club's wealthy patron, The Duke (Richard Roxburgh), wants Satine for himself and is willing to make her the real actress she longs to be in return for her affections.  I was rather surprised to discover such a deeply emotional tale at the heart of this movie; it is a beautiful but tragic love story that outshines even the incredibly lavish production numbers for which this film is most famous.I love musicals, but I had come to doubt the ability of modern moviemakers to make one worth seeing.  What director Baz Luhrmann has done is to actually reinvent the musical as audiences know it.  It sounds strange to say that the music for a movie set in 1900 consists of modern pop, opera, hip-hop, and other songs of the late twentieth century, but it really works beautifully and draws the modern viewer more deeply into the world of ""real artificiality"" Luhrmann succeeded in creating.  If you had asked my thoughts on having two guys who look like David Spade and Rip Taylor singing Madonna's Like a Virgin in a movie, I would have laughed you out the door, yet it actually works in Moulin Rouge.  Each of the terrific songs included here does serve rather than detract from the story itself.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman do actually sing their own songs, it is important to note, and I was amazed to discover that Kidman's singing voice is as beautiful as she is herself.  Dialogue alone could never manufacture the power unleashed by the music of Moulin Rouge, and the great tragedy of the story is made even more poignant by songs such as the haunting Come What May.  Don't think this movie uses its garish production numbers as a means of hiding a weak story because the love story of Christian and Satine is nothing short of breathtaking, heartbreaking, and somehow wondrously beautiful all at the same time.A terrific movie deserves a terrific DVD release, and Moulin Rouge features more extras than I could even watch all at once.  When you watch the movie, you will marvel at the sets and costumes and wonder how on earth this movie was made.  There are features on just about every aspect of the making of Moulin Rouge included on Disc Two.  I love the commentaries and interviews, but what I really love are the uncut dance sequences.  The dance numbers in this movie are just beautiful and beyond amazing, but they cannot be shown uncut in the film itself because things are happening story-wise at the same time and those scenes take precedence over the dances.  Here, not only can you watch each of these musical production numbers in its completeness, you can even watch each one from multiple camera angles.I know there are some people who dismiss this movie out of hand because it is a musical or because the hedonistic themes revealed in the movie previews give the impression of gaudiness over substance.  This is not a musical in the traditional sense of the word, and the sets, while opulently lavish, are actually less stunning than the plot itself.  This is a love story for the ages, sprinkled with comedy but dominated by the deepest of human emotions.  Even though I was interested in this movie from the time it was released, I myself did not expect story itself to be as powerful and moving as it is.  Moulin Rouge is, in almost every conceivable way, one of the best motion pictures I have ever seen."	5.0	A breathtakingly beautiful and unique love story	2003-04-20	8	6	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2L6I5EB157RGL	Daniella Hull	This is a movie that one has to see not only with their eyes but with all their senses.  You must be open and willing to enjoy the movie for what it is....entertainment.  To you love struck people....you owe it to yourself to see this movie at least once. People who do not enjoy musicals leave the theater in this magical place where the Moulin Rouge lives and find themselves singing and humming the familiar mixes from the soundtrack.  EVERYONE at one point or another during the show can identify with a character, with a situation and find themselves wanting to believe that all will end happily!  But will it???  You decide for yourself.  Enjoy one of the best films ever, in my opinion.	5.0	Imagination to the Infinite Degree	2001-07-13	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1GALZCXD8FHOR	Daniel L Edelen	"Think ""Moulin Rouge"" is Best Picture material?Think more like ""Gigi"" on LSD. Or think 'Myra Breckinridge"" but without the sex-change. Either way, laugh at the joke and move on.Style over substance seems to be high on the list of the Oscar people lately. What else can explain ""Gladiator"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" even GETTING nominations for best pic? Still, despite the fact that there's no ""there"" there, ""Moulin Rouge!"" is a serious piece of eye candy. Stunning set, computer, and costume work make this one of the most visually interesting movies ever filmed. Baz Luhrmann's eye is golden here. The Art Nouveau meets ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" design is unforgettable and carries the entire piece.The cast camps it up enough to make John Waters proud. The leads, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, are luminous and - frighteningly - equally pretty. And they are asked to shift gears so many times in the film's running that only Oscar-caliber actors could have pulled it off. Jim Broadbent is also winning in his role of the Rouge's owner/emcee.But the film doesn't work. The camp obscures the drama; there's a huge sell factor here and everything just can't be bought. The choice to do a musical is inspired, but the decision to go with modern songs crashes the film/audience barrier and just crushes the mood. There's something about watching the leads trade lines from the likes of U2 and Pet Shop Boys that  takes the groan factor to another level. Turning The Police's ""Roxanne"" into a tango number was the final straw for me. Ha ha to the film's producers. They got us good.As for the two-disc DVD, it adds a few enhanced scenes and a decent selection of the usual DVD add-ons. Its okay, but not groundbreaking.One major problem with the DVD was sound. The levels were just too wide - too loud in song selections, too soft in many of speaking sections. And sadly, the dialog boost was spotty, particularly during songs. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume, finally gave up, and just turned on the subtitles.If you want a feast for the eyes, get ""Moulin Rouge!"" now. Those looking for anything else will be disappointed."	3.0	Like a gorgeous, but empty-headed blond	2002-12-18	10	9	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3GRANSGMYPX00	"Danielle Kuehnel ""A Trendy Twentysomething"""	I can say, without shame, that 'Moulin Rouge' is my very favorite movie - ever. Indeed, this film started me on Baz Luhrmann.Many critics have deemed the modern musical as a long music video on stereoids. I could not disagree more. 'Moulin Rouge' is definitely two hours worth of pure eye candy, music to sing along to, and lines to laugh at. The movie will also appeal to people of many generations, as most of the songs are redone from older songs, such as: 'Smells Like Teen Spirit,' 'Silly Love Songs,' 'Like a Virgin,' 'Your Song,' and 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend.' The list goes on. I definitely recommend the soundtrack if you enjoyed this old music with new pizzazz.'Moulin Rouge' will make you laugh, cry, sing, and dance. It will leave you wanting more. Plus, to some, the overall picture of this story will make you think. What is important in life? Fame and fortune? Or love and happiness?Baz does an excellent job directing the cinematography. The colors are lush, and there is always movement. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous.Moreover, the DVD is also a true find. If you liked the film, you will absolutely love the DVD. There are so many extras, where does one begin? There are numerous mini documentaries about the dancing, the special effects, and so much more. The DVD features cast interviews, cut or expanded scenes, and dance scenes with different angles. Definitely worth the extra dollars!Overall, I highly recommend this amazing, beautiful, thoughtful, and exquisite film. It is definitely a must-see, and worth not five stars, but all the stars in the sky!	5.0	Absolutely amazing	2004-08-22	1	1	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A27CFNHYZG6WS8	darragh o'donoghue	Here are a few of my favourite things: Paris, Pigalle, bordellos, nightclubs, the Belle Epoque, Offenbach, Toulouse-Lautrec; musicals, dancing, over-emotional crooning, intricate choreography; glitter, glamour, dazzle, flowers, theatre, the colour red, dressing up, melodrama, opera; Ewan McGregor's wide-eyed grin; T-Rex and David Bowie; Jim Broadbent; the mythology of Orpheus and the Underworld; aristocrats (preferably dastardly), bohemians, love; films that move like a complex musical score rather than by conventional narrative.'Moulin Rouge!' should be my dream film, it has all the above in exuberant abundance.  It is directed by Baz Luhrmann, the director who had taken over the mantle of Powell and Pressburger, Douglas Sirk, Stanley Donen and Vincente Minnelli, and restored magic, music, colour, romance and rapture to film.It is the biggest disappointment I've had in years.  'Moulin' is closer to later Fellini than any of the above - a racket full of visual clutter and noise.  The choreography is hamfisted, the ambitious musical scoring clumsy, the set-pieces pitched all wrong.  Like Michael Cimino in 'Heaven's Gate', Luhrman forgot that his previous films anchored spectacle in character - floating loose here, it merely pummels your sensibilities.It's not even necessary to have interesting characters - in 'The Red Shoes' and 'Tales of Hoffman' (to which Luhrmann clearly aspires), the Archers were able to give visual breath to complex emotion through colour, music and movement alone.  But those films were precisely choreographed - here every element is fragmented and never gells to achieve the expected crescendo.It seems a shame to spend so much on astonishing sets and then not give us the space to appreciate them.  The use of pop songs to recreate for us the original pull of the Moulin Rouge, to mark the temporal crossroads in which the film is set (1900: between Victorian opulence and the dawn of modernity signalled by cinema (nice nod to Melies!)), would have been inspired if Luhrmann HAD used pop songs, instead of the middle-brow, middle-aged likes of Queen, Elton John and Sting.  Too often, 'Moulin' plays like a rehearsal for the film, rather than the real thing.It's not all bad - the bedroom farce between Christian, Satine and the Duke is funny; Zidler's bamboozling the Duke with 'Like A Virgin' is unexpected and subversive -  Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh are amiable throughout.  Luhrman manages to evoke somehting of the transience and terror revealed in Toulouse-Lautrec's famous posters and paintings of the Moulin Rouge.  The cross-cutting between the tango and Satine's sacrificing herself to the Duke is brilliant, overpowering cinema, using (relatively) minimal means to shattering emotional effect, a method that could have been more profitably used throughout.  'Moulin' is easily the best blockbuster of a wretched summer; with Luhrmann, it should have been so, so much more.	3.0	I'm gutted.	2001-09-19	11	3	8

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AGPGR3GCJHMUC	Darryl Williamson	I went into this film with a mixed mind, i had seen the glorious Romeo and Juliet- and had it on DVD, but i was worried that even Bazz himself could not even pull off a movie this grand as well as ridiculous.  My worries were unfounded as this movie is absolutely superb.  In fact the movie runs smoothly with extremely few glitches (Unfortunately, these glitches lay within the limitations of the screenplay), and the acting is superb; romantic, dramatic and completely satiric.  There was also alot of fun watchly the genuine chemistry between the two leads.  They were almost as good as Leo and Clare were in R+J.  The musical numbers are great too, I never would have thought that Ewan could sing like that, i will have to find time to go and buy the album.  Its just a shame that the screenplay wasn't as 'up to scratch' as the musical numbers chosen.  Overall though, this film definately deserves its 5 stars.	5.0	The liveliest revamp of modern pop music ever- fabulous	2001-09-30	1	1	0

People seem to view musicals as boring and don't often give one a chance.  This one is worth your time.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor both give wonderful performances as well as revealing to us that they both have beautiful singing voices.  The direction of the movie is brilliant and the vivid colors along with the fast pace of the musical numbers give the movie a MTV feel (but better than anything you see on that channel).  The dvd is full of extras (including the dismal ""Lady Marmalade"" video, which I won't hold against them) so I highly recommend this 2 disc dvd to anyone.  I hope that we will see a return of good musicals thanks to this excellent piece of work."	5.0	The return of the movie musical!!!	2002-02-10	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A398FD7XNE6ISZ	Dave Beards	There seems to be two schools of thought regarding Baz Luhrmann's 2000 cinematic musical extravaganza Moulin Rouge - boring rubbish or shining star in commercial movie making. Considering I have awarded five stars, it's safe to assume that I do not belong to the former!From the creative opening titles (red curtains opening up to reveal the Fox logo, with a rather manic orchestra conductor included), you know you're in for something different to the Hollywood norm. The entire film continuously bombards its audience with an amazing array of visual imagery - constantly moving bold colours, stunning costumes, fast paced editing, energetic dancing and recognisable modern music.The plot is fairly predictable - poor boy falls in love with popular girl, they fall in love and against all odds they come together only to have one die. The entire plot is given away within the first few minutes so it's safe to say that the plot of Moulin Rouge is secondary to the visuals.Ewan and Nicole do an excellent job characterising through song - A brave move for two well known and popular actors to expose their other talents to the world - a move that has paid off handsomely. Whatever people think of the movie, their performances are difficult to fault.The standout actor for me is the Australia Richard Roxburgh. Despite some roles in Hollywood movies like MI2, he remains unheard of outside Australia. As the Duke, Richard shows us another side to his acting - cartoonish comedy combined with evil drama. Richard is an amazing character actor and hopefully Hollywood will see more of him in the future.The 2 disc DVD set is packed to the brim with extras, giving fans the opportunity to explore Moulin Rouge to its' deepest depths.Disc one has the movie itself as well as 2 engaging and entertaining audio commentaries. There is a special version of the movie entitled 'Behind the velvet curtain' where several times during the movie a green windmill pops up and pressing enter on your DVD will bring up a featurette pertaining to that section of the movie, such as the in-depth discussion of the creation of the stunning opening sequence.Disc 2 has many featurettes and interviews to explore. From the music to the costumes, a huge amount of information is divulged for the fans who wish to explore the movie making process. My complaint here it is that many of the actors and behind the scenes crew give glowing accolades to the Director Baz Luhrmann. He may very well be a genius, but we don't really need to be reminded of it every 5 seconds. Aside from that minor gripe though, there are many hours of entertainment in the special features.Whatever your opinion of Moulin Rouge, it has been a pioneer in recent Hollywood movie making, leading to the current revival of the Hollywood musical. If you can get past the thin plot and immerse yourself in the colourful, fast paced world of the Moulin Rouge, you will discover a very special movie..	5.0	A turning point in modern Hollywood movie making.	2003-05-03	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AIMGHPI1AGVRF	Davewise	"There are lots of things to love about this movie. The blend of modern music with a classic musical sounds is done so well. One might not think of having groups of men in suits and women in can-can girl dresses singing ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Nirvana but (incredibly) it works. The songs chosen fit the story well; I laughed when they started singing ""Roxanne"" in the scene where they were discussing falling for a prostitute because it was perfect yet I didn't expect it. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have wonderful on-screen chemistry and both have terrific voices. All the acting in general is well done.The writing is superb, from all the original material fleshing out the characters and the story, to the intermingling of excerpts from contemporary songs. There are some fantastic elements at times - a scene with Ewan and Nicole dancing from one building to another comes to mind - but these go with the whimsical feel of much of the film. Many of the sets and costumes are colorful and dazzling, the perfect compliment to the energetic dancing at the Moulin Rouge. Early on it's clear the story is destined to end tragically; however, the positive message about love and spirited portrayal prevent the film from being a downer."	5.0	A very energetic, tragic musical	2012-02-01	3	2	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is one of the most creative musicals created in cinema history.  It deservingly garnered eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, winning two.  Baz Luhrmann created his best work in his directing career.  The plot is only one of many movie details that makes it so spectacular.  Its remakes of classic songs from the mid to late 1900's have a new creative musical flavor that pleases audiences, though the film takes place in 1899-1900.  Its clever writing in a style of a stage play makes it more enjoyable.  Besides them, its theme of forbidden love found in Moulin Rouge, a French night club, contains many unique twists and turns.  As Sadine's fiance begins suspecting about her relationship with Christian, the threat of disaster arises, keeping audiences interested.  Sadine's yearning for a happier life away from Paris and with Christian adds interesting dramatic flavors to the plot.  However, there's a catch.  Sadine has tuberculosis (there was no cure in 1899).  She must act upon her dreams soon; otherwise, she'll die before experiencing happiness.Nicole Kidman's breakthrough role as a serious actress started in her role as Sadine.  She deservingly earned a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her great efforts.  No other could have performed Sadine better.  Kidman's singing voice is incredible, considering before accepting the role, she had no singing ability.  Ewan McGregor also amazes audiences with his role as Christian.  His charm and his romantic side are very convincing, which adds his own unique interesting flavor to the film.  Kidman And McGregor's chemistry as performers are perfect.  All other actors, major or minor, also performed beautifully: Jim Broadbent, Kylie Minogue, and many more.The elaborate Oscar winning costume design and the art direction are very marvelous.  Such hard work paid off, offering audiences a more spectacular reaction.  Therefore, it's more than just computer effects that made the art more realistic-looking.  The camera effects and the editing offer their own perspectives as they further shine the colors, attracting bigger audiences.&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a great movie for those looking for something highly unique.  This is great for fans of musicals.  However, this film may create musical fans.  This will surely entertain many audiences and keep them dancing and singing for a long time.  The bonus features offer an interesting look at the making and the history of this film, including interviews, behind-the-scenes, the studio recordings, and more.Fans of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; are also recommended movies &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Evita&quot;.  Such combination will add more spark to this unforgettable experience.  Those looking to hear more of Nicole Kidman's newfound music should buy Robbie William's album &quot;Swing When You're Winning&quot; (an import and not to be confused with his US release &quot;Sing ...&quot;, notice the missing &quot;w&quot;).  It includes a duet he recorded with Kidman, &quot;Something Stupid&quot;, which reached #1 on the UK Billboard Top 100 Singles charts in 2001.	5.0	How Wonderful Life Is, Now Moulin Rouge Is In the World	2004-01-28	5	5	0

I for one enjoyed this ballet of borrowed musical source material, quick-cut editing, sumptuous art design and beautiful costumes.  This film is a true original and, yet, at it's core it is a story about a boy and a girl.  If Luhrmann didn't have a game cast this film would not have worked so kudos in particular to Ewan McGregor, one of our more underrated actors, and Nicole Kidman for being up to the challenge.  Jim Broadbent, as the master of ceremonies, gives an outstanding job here as well.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1AKDW4P8V72R4	"David C. Anderson ""fenrisbooks"""	This is another one of those movies that you either love or you hate. I seem to be in the minority. As a fan of musicals I was looking forward to the film, and definitely to the rebirth of the movie musical. I was quite disappointed by this film though. First, it represents everything that is bad about postmodernism. The quick cut editing (a la MTV and Michael Bay) doesn't lend itself to a musical - or at least a traditional musical) and before you say it isn't a traditional musical (which I realize), understand that musicals rely on staging for effect. The director is so quick to change the shot or angle before the audience gets bored that he never allows the actors to truly perform. At times it becomes even cartoonish and while an accurate approximation of a vaudville musical, it's hard to generate any sympathy for Nicole Kidman or to even begin to care about the love story when Baz doesn't care enough to develop the characters beyond two dimensions. With only one original song, the soundtrack sounds like a well done greatest hits of pop songs with elaborate orchestration. Kind of like The Boston Pops does KIIS 97 FM (The best hits of the seventies, eighties, and nineties). While Luhrman certainly has an eye (reminiscent of Terry Gilliam in many ways) it doesn't lend itself to a musical - and without his help this production (as beautiful as it is) collapses under its own weight.	2.0	Bad News Musical	2002-08-07	2	1	1

I started work at Warner Brothers in 1962 on My Fair Lady, and over the years, have worked on such films as Mary Poppins, and TV shows such as the A-Team (5 Yrs) Beverly Hills 90210 (4 Yrs) and will shortly begin my 7th year on NYPD Blue. I have seen many special effects (I worked on StarTrek, Superman, etc.) but I have never seen the likes of the cinematography, art direction, minatures, make-up, costuming, and special effects exhibited by Moulin Rouge....and, wait, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor actually have the talent not only to act, but to do their own singing? My God, if this picture doesn't win at LEAST 6 Oscars, then the Motion Picture Academy is not doing its job....ie. this is one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen in my nearly 30 years of working on the sets of Hollywood at every major studio.

If you have not seen this one, I recommend you try it.  And if you do, make sure to watch for more than the first 20 minutes... when I first saw it, the beginning seemed so frantic and the pace was so quick, I thought it was little more than a quirky music video.  I was ready to walk out.But if you stay with it until the ""poetry reading"" scene, you'll probably be hooked by the story and the humor of it!  This is definitely one of those movies that was made boldly, and people either love or hate it - very few shrug their shoulders and say ""It was okay.""  I think it's one of the great stories/movies of the past decade.The film makes VERY unusual use of music and lyrics, and the result gives the love story an emotional impact far beyond most other great movie love stories.  And the dazzling visual style ""wows me"" over and over.  Often, being aware of a ""visual style"" in a movie is a sign that a director is more interested in impressing us with his/her clever movie-making than in telling a compelling story.  If a ""dazzling"" visual style of a film distracts me from the story, I will dislike the visual style for interfering.  But in the case of Moulin Rouge, I found the style and the visual elements added very significantly to the emotional impact of the story.It's one of the best and boldest movies I have seen in recent years, and one of the very few that I find myself re-watching every year or two."	5.0	You'll love it or you'll hate it... but you shouldn't miss it	2010-01-09	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1DAOL3NMHEPLS	David F. Nolan	The storyline of this &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; borrows heavily from &quot;La Traviata,&quot; which in turn was based on &quot;La Dame aux Camelias&quot; -- a tragic love story about a tuberculosis-stricken courtesan who ... well, if you haven't seen the movie, I won't spoil it for you. And in any case, the storyline is there just to hang eye-popping, extravagant musical numbers on.  None of it is very believable, but it's fun in a trippy, overblown way. The 1960s-80s music works surprisingly well with the stylized 1900-era setting (&quot;Paris as imagined by Tim Burton,&quot; in one reviewer's words) and the performances are entertaining. Ewan MacGregor is a bit too low-key -- I would have loved to see Jim Carrey in the role of Christian -- but otherwise the cast carries out their assignments quite well.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A185HGLJQOH1K7	David Harris	"After having enjoyed Chicago so much, I thought there might be a coming wave of good musicals. Moulin Rouge is not on of them, though. It's not even in the same league as Chicago. The music is very offputting. Sadly, 90% or more is unoriginal.Campy versions of ""Like a Virgin"" and ""Roxanne"" provide some entertainment, leading you to believe the whole thing is just harmless fun. Yet a seemingly never-ending overly bombastic version of Elton John's Your Song makes it clear that they are serious, and it just makes you cringe. (Note: EJ/BT wrote some of the best songs of the 20th century, but Your Song is *not* one of them.)Sadly, the one song the show had going for it (Rufus Wainwright's ""Complainte De La Butte"") only gets heard for about 10 seconds during the introduction to the film. What a disappointment! Having the lyrics to that song fit into the plot could have added a whole extra dimension to the story and the visual aspect of the film. The steps up Montmartre lead through such a picturesque area of Paris. Very sad that they missed out on this opportunity.The digitized view of Paris with the Eiffel Tower looks as cheesy as can be, but the interior and exterior shots of the Moulin Rouge itself are quite spectacular.Nicole Kidman, what were you thinking? You are so abundantly talented as such films as To Die For attest. Then I see you in this and the pathetic remake of Stepford Wives and I have to wonder if you don't need a new agent."	1.0	Campy remakes of of 70s and 80s songs disappointing	2006-03-18	19	2	17

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2B21POKQ3N09H	David J. Gannon	Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge is an extravaganza of sight and sound and frenetic action.  An effort, or so we are told, to bring the musical, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century, this work relies on sleight of hand, action and technical wizardry to ensnare and captivate the audience.On the whole, it works.  Critical supporting elements are in place to a sufficient degree to allow this experiment to succeed.  There is a base story, and, if it is not exactly intellectually stimulating, neither is it overly embarrassing (a phenomenon not unknown in the musical format).  Moreover, it is emotionally accessible, at least sufficient to the needs.  The stars are attractive, compelling and engaged-they have obviously bought into the concept and are quite visibly giving it their all here.  And the set and costumes are beguiling.The deficiencies in the film are directorial and post-production related.  There is too much outright emotional manipulation related solely to change in action-frenetic action and excessive sensory stimulation cutting abruptly to dark, quiet, bleak desperation.  A bit of that is OK-it's a device seriously overused here. There are also editing issues-at times one suspects that film was randomly chopped up by scissors and then randomly spliced back together.  To say it's uneven is to understate the situation.Those may seem somewhat cosmetic issues, but in what amounts to a cosmetic exercise, the effects are amplified.On the whole this reminds me of some of Robert Altman's efforts prior to MASH and Nashville.  The talent shows through, the concept is valid, the technology works-yet the whole thing has not quite come together into a unified whole.On the bright side, this film has achieved such a level of commercial and critical success it's likely that the time and money is bound to be invested in making the concept and technology achieve what quite clearly would be a wonderful entertainment experience.  I look forward to seeing it.In the meantime, Moulin Rouge will certainly whet ones appetite.	4.0	A triumph of Style over Substance--sort of.	2002-03-11	1	0	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1QLWH7KZ8KZCY	David Selby	Well, I have got to say that Moulin Rouge is one of the best films that I have seen in a long time.  I was not going to watch it but was persuaded to by my woman, Fiona! The story line, based on love, music, good and bad was all that it should have been - Fiona had her tissue out - she said that she had something in her eye, but I'm not so sure?  The film effects/camera work/use of perspective were excellent - you found that you were rapped up in the moment as you were whisked off into `dream happy land'.  The music as well, the use of songs and dance rhythms that you recognise, to enhance the story line, just excellent.  Go and see it.	5.0	Outstanding...	2001-06-21	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2KG8WLR1AKO12	"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator"""	Anyone contemplating to see this movie should consider waiting for the DVD and CD editions.  The movie itself is irritating and incoherent.  The actors are required to  utter lines so inane as to be embarrassing.  The romantic duo of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, though, is a winner.  John Leguizamo successfully portrays  Toulouse-Lautrec.  The single most important role minimally holding together &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is that of Zindler, the pimp-theater owner played by the excellent  character actor Jim Broadbent.  The leading stars possess more than enough talent to carry out their singing responsibilities.  The love story is only mildly interesting,  and has been done better many times previously.  &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is admittedly visually stunning.  Nevertheless,  the occasional virtues of the film don't begin to  justify the patience demanded to view it until the dreary end.The DVD edition of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; will allow you to ignore the banal scenes while enjoying the beautifully choreographed musical numbers.  Movie producers today seek myriad  revenue streams to justify the cost of their investment.  Regrettably,  a mindset has been inevitably fostered that often perceives the actual movie of no more importance  than the accompanying ways of earning a profit.  Almost certainly that is what occurred in this particular situation.  The movie &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; earns a mere three stars,  but I suspect the soon to be released DVD will deserve five.	3.0	&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a Superb DVD Advertisement, but...	2001-07-15	9	3	6
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A16XFPVH72H01H	Davlyn Jones	Moulin Rouge was a trip down memory lane for all the 40's and 50's type musicals where the main characters would burst out in song whenever the spirit moved them. I loved the juxtaposition of modern songs with classic dance numbers that were &quot;adjusted&quot; for the attention span deficit MTV audience while still making the film good for us oldies but goldies.. The Mack Sennett-type comedy was also on target and very enjoyable. The villian twirled his moustache appropriately and sneered with the best of them. The cast capered around like monkeys in several hilarious scenes. The whole movie was very enjoyable. Nicole Kidman should get great acclaim for this movie as your eyes never left her whenever she was in a scene. I understand she was in crutches during the final closeups because of those ridiculous high heels she had to wear. Lots of grit there and one hopes she has no lasting ankle and leg problems because of it. Ewan McGregor was also a winning actor, handsome and passionate in the role. John Leguisamos was just perfect as Toulouse and was a film highlight. All sang wonderfully. Not too professional but right for the role. I felt Moulin Rouge was a perfect picture and the director should get many accolades for it. Go see it for all the memories, the comedy and the sheer beauty of it. It is the last you will see of the beautiful set. They burned it soon after the movie release. What a dumb thing to do. Maybe that's the message of the movie.. You can only go back in time once. But in this case, see this movie many times. You won't regret it.	4.0	Do you know your musicals?	2001-08-25	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A357V4M2N8IZNN	"Dawn Linke ""thenewlinke"""	This movie is a stunning mixture of effects, acting, and music.  The story is classic with a twist of reality.  I never like Nicole Kidman until I saw this movie.  I began watching it fully prepared to hate it but, by the end, I was floored with the passion the movie projects.  The beginning was fast paced, choppy montague of the present and memories/writing of the past that can disorientate you but, in the end it all flows into a passionate masterpiece that wrenches the heart.  If you want a powerful film that shows the true meaning of love, Moulin Rouge is for you.	5.0	Only one word - WOW!!!	2002-09-17	4	3	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A35WRDXBBBRZW9	D. Bartell	This movie is a real ride!!!  It&#65533;s a combination carnival, opera, Broadway musical and a little MTV thrown in.  It&#65533;s a clever and imaginative film that uses the camera to move constantly. Zooming in and out and sweeping around  circa 1900 Paris cityscapes.  It presents itself in ever moving visuals.  The ever familiar  songs and lavish production numbers seem to be perfectly sequenced, much like some of the old MGM musicals. This, of course,  attributed to the filmaking genius of Australian director Baz Luhrmann.This is not a dialogue driven film.  In fact, the plot is familiar and not overdone, and deliberately meant to be that way.  It&#65533;s enough to keep you apprised of the story going on in the background while it spins and creates a fantasy land presented in glitz,  frenzied energy, glamour,  and classic  popular songs.Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman and the rest of the cast are no slouches, either.  This couple really throw sparks as the hopeless romantics in the film.  All the actors sing their own songs and are quite talented at it in a not so perfect Broadway kind of way....This is by no means an adequate or ordinary film.  It&#65533;s unique and yes, familiar.  It&#65533;s meant to be a crowd pleaser.  Even though the pace of the movie is frenetic, it is also comforting, for most people anyway.  Kind of like a ride at Disneyland!	4.0	and away we go!	2003-02-23	2	2	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2G4MGVWR20OOI	D. Brown	I loved this film, and I hate musicals. I usually find musicals to be very heavy handed, sappy, and pointless. But Moulin Rouge greatly contradicted my previous experiences. It was fast paced, beautiful, emotional, and above all, the music was great. Moulin Rouge had music from many genres, and time periods. This helped keep the `anti-musical' viewer, like myself, entertained. Music aside, the excellent acting in the film told a great story. I am usually not a big fan of Ewan McGregor, John Leguizamo, or even Nicole Kidman. But once again my earlier impressions misled me. They all did very well. In fact, there were no characters in Moulin Rouge that gave less than ideal performances. If you want a film that is truly creative, and exciting, then by all means, get Moulin Rouge.	5.0	Awesome!	2002-11-06	1	0	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1WTMIQCBHIPBL	"""deansf"""	I was most fortunate to be in L.A. during the preview weekend, and found this to be the most amazingly brilliant and original film I've seen in many years. I can tell that this film may not be for everyone, as it was so different from my expectations. The first 30 minutes are frenetic and more than I bargained for, and after the film was over I wasn't sure how I felt about it.  I don't pretend to know much about film making, but upon awakening the next morning I realized I had been completely  blown-away and I have been obsessed with Moulin Rouge &amp; Nicole ever since. My senses and emotions have been reeling, and it took a while to realize I had seen a most remarkable effort that we may not see again for some time. Baz Luhrmann is genius, and Nicole Kidman and cast (Ewan McGregor! and John Leguizamo!) have my profound respect for risking their careers in such a bold, daring work - and a musical at that!  Way to go, Nicole! Everything in the film was perfect and brilliant while balancing on such a fine line.  It works! Costumes, art direction, cinematography, acting, music, singing and choreography create visions you will not soon forget.  The use of contemporary songs and music will surprise and delight.  And the story of &quot;truth, beauty, freedom and love&quot; set against the bohemian backdrop of the Montmartre district of Paris 100 years ago will entertain you, from the madcap comedy of errors in the beginning to the emotional crescendo that grabs your heart at the end.  Again, this may not be for everyone, but I can't aplogize for my enthusiasm and over-the-top hyperbole...  go along for the colorful spectacular ride and perhaps you will find the magic of the Moulin Rouge as well.	5.0	The cinematic breakthrough we've been waiting for!	2001-05-31	2	1	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	Ten minutes into viewing &quot;Moulon Rouge,&quot; I understood exactly why this is a movie that people either love or hate.  The strange juxtaposition of contemporary music with Paris of the 1890's, of garish sets and wild characters with a love story, can rattle even the most jaded viewer.  To like this movie, you have to enjoy the bizarre and be prepared for one of the most dizzying, sensory-assaulting films ever.Ewan McGregor is convincing as the poverty-stricken writer who by accident lands a job writing a &quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot; for the Moulin Rouge.  When he falls in love with the sultry performer Satine (Nicole Kidman, in a fantastic performance), he must hide it from the manager of the Moulin Rouge, who has other plans for Satine.  In the meantime, Satine has her own secrets.  The plot explodes into a collage of slapstick, musical numbers, comedy of manners, neon lights, circus acts, and a Fellini-like surrealism.  The result can be mind-numbing but enormously rewarding for those who can stand it.Obviously, this film is not for the conventionally-minded. If you don't feel like having your senses assaulted, pick another DVD.  However, if you are looking for a truly outrageous film, or if your tastes are off-beat and unpredictable, you may have found your movie.	4.0	A bizarre but rewarding collage of sight and sound	2003-02-22	5	4	1

IF you like theatre; IF you like over-abundance; IF you like musicals; IF you like a style like Baz Luhrman (think the more recent ""Romeo & Juliet"") and his flare for telling a story in an inordinately colorful way, then you will love this movie.I loved everything about it.  From the costumes to the story, every part of it made me smile.  I laughed and I cried.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were amazing, as was the entire cast, all using their own, undubbed voices for their songs.  I loved that they used modern songs in the different areas of the movie that were sung by the cast, not just thrown in there.  Those songs not being sung by the original artists really gave it the feel that I was in the theatre, not watching a movie.I truly loved this movie.  If you do not like any of the ""IF's"" I mentioned above, then you probably won't like it.  I do, however, recommend that you see it just once, because you never know.

Its brings forth a new age of musicals, the film features stiring renditions of songs by Elton John, The Police, The Beatles, Patti Labelle and even a slection from The Sound of Music. The film spin and spirals into a dazzling story of truth, beauty, freedom, jealousy, and that which our hero (played and sung by Ewan McGregor) belives in above all things Love. Nicole kidman and Ewan Mcgegor show off there (suprisingly) real incredible singing voices. Other highlights of the film are John Legiuzamo as the drunken bohemian Toluse Lautrec... at the historically correct height. Jim Broadbent as the mildly insane yet heartfelt Harold Zidler (owner of the Moulin Rouge) wows and dazzles. The film combines incredible timeless songs, oscar worthy performances, beautiful cinematography, and a story that will last forever.I close with our hero's (and Nat King Coles) immortal wordsThe greatest thing youll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.Buy the movie and share it with the world.	5.0	How Wonderfull Life is...	2001-12-16	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3QEJ40NQEW36Q	"Desired FX ""Call me Don. It's shorter than Is..."	Whether you like this movie depends mostly on whether you buy into Baz Luhrmann's unique vision, because there's nothing to fault in the brilliant production values.  This movie is crafted perfectly: every frame is where it belongs and is photographed gorgeously, every note and sound is flawlessly performed and perfectly timed.If, like me, you believe that the film was a splendid idea--the marriage of modern music to a period setting, designed to give us something much easier to relate to than a stuffy, parlor piece--this will be one of your favorite films from 2001.  I'm not a particular fan of musicals, but I was mesmerized by MOULIN ROUGE! I saw it on HBO and knew before half an hour had elapsed that I had to have the film in my collection. I've watched it close to 10 times in the last month.I can't praise the performers enough: Ewan McGregor's smile is positively dazzling, Nicole Kidman (not one of my favorite actors) shines like &quot;the sparkling diamond,&quot; John Leguizamo lends a poignance to Toulouse, Jim Broadbent's Zidler is a man I want to party with, and Richard Roxburgh's Duke has just the sort of sniveling bite that will make you love to hate him.So why do so many people think this film is stupid?The music.Like Brian Helgeland's A KNIGHT'S TALE, MOULIN ROUGE! attempts to marry the modern with the classic, mixing original songs with modern hits like Elton John's &quot;Your Song,&quot; The Police's &quot;Roxanne,&quot; Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; Madonna's &quot;Like a Virgin,&quot; and a medley of pretty much every overplayed love song from the last 20 years.My sister told me it was the medley that lost her--it didn't work for her, so she was knocked out of Luhrmann's tableau.So that seems to be what it comes down to: do you like to see a film take chances? Are you willing to give the director enough rope to hang himself on the off chance that he'll use the rope to pull his audience up to a higher level?I love this movie, and I love the DVD even more: special features that are spectacular, brilliantly integrated into the film itself so you can see Luhrmann's thought processes at work. If, as with THE MATRIX, every DVD producer made the extras this entertaining, people would actually watch something other than the deleted scenes.Part of the genius of MOULIN ROUGE!, as exposed by the special features, is that it feels like Luhrmann's not finished with it, yet--that if he had the time and the money, he'd go back and change it yet again, showing us different facets of the sparkling diamond, darker corners of the underworld, and maybe more of McGregor's teeth.	5.0	Whatever you think, you can't fault the craft.	2002-11-04	1	0	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A24J8VSI5F3WP5	Devan Dillinger	This movie is one of two movies that I bought without even seeing it before, and I fell in love with it. Since it came out in the theaters, most of my friends told me that I need to see it. It went out of the theaters before I had a chance to see it. Then one day, I found it on DVD, watched it and then I knew what all of my friends were talking about.The movie takes place in late 19th century and in a place called the Moulin Rouge. Other than that, there is nothing &quot;period&quot; about it. The whole thing is Baz Luhrman's vision. It is a fast pace rollar coaster through the story with music being the car that you ride in. This is one of the most unique movies that I have seen in a long time. It was refreshing to see something that was not your typical Hollywood film.Some people didn't like the fact that modern music was being used, but I feel that this aspect brought the feeling of the 19th century into the 21st. It connected me to the movie in a what that could not have been done if music from the time was used. I still find myself singing or humming the songs.Visually, the movie was beautiful. The costumes were done wonderfully and nothing in that department felt out of place with me.I will admit, this is not a movie for everyone, but it is one that I will always love and enjoy	5.0	Just loved it  :)	2002-05-21	1	0	1

Moulin Rouge was awful--yes, just awful, not even worthy of the one star I have given it.  Yes, it may be an extravaganza, but what does this word really mean?  Is it meant to portray this garish concoction of fin-du-ciecle cabaret pierced with groteseque 21st century sexuality and voiced with the modern songs of Elton John etc. ?  The skewed camera angles peeking up the voluminous skirts revealing fish-netted thunder-thighs (Ugh) gave me the frantic, queasy feeling that I was participating in a stale rendition of a neverending Mardi Gras gone awry after four or five days guzzling of cheap beer.The star goes to poor Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor--I have to wonder why people of this acting caliber would ever want to be in such a film unless it was done solely for charity.Relieved that I did not see this one on the big screen as there would have been absolutely no escape other than leaving the theatre before the film's end.	1.0	Macabre	2002-02-14	15	6	9

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AK4IKE7XNTKP0	D-Mac	I skipped the theatrical release... the trailer is much more intense and enthralling, believe it or not, than the movie itself. The DVD product shows off very well the possibilities for additional content not available in the video format.After watching all of the director's commentary and behind-the-scenes material, I am convinced that the best of the movie's story was removed prior to production. While the set and costume design are stunning and should garner several award nominations, the singing was quite weak, the acting pretty good given the poor script and choppy &quot;MTVish super quick cuts&quot; editing style. The editing probably had the most detrimental affect on the overall quality of the finished product. Make-up design was excellent, as well.Speaking of &quot;product,&quot; I can't help but think that, in the end, that's all that mattered: creating a highly marketable product without full concentration on the storytelling, visual presentation / pacing, and character development. I didn't expect an &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; level of darkness or character development, but &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was horribly weak, using the &quot;rough and wild&quot; bohemian atmosphere in Paris to serve as only the most superficial setup for the movie. There was no balance to the slick musical numbers and nice costuming... bad wasn't really bad, dark and murky wasn't, and there was no really compelling tension in the movie, nor any reason to view the characters as sympathetic, or not, but rather as two dimensional caricatures.Great idea, poor execution... similar to Star Wars Episode 1, which got too caught up in the computer animation and special effects and didn't present a decent, compelling storyline and &quot;real&quot; characters. Perhaps, the best part of the story/dialog was to use song lyrics from (mostly) recognizable pop songs (or was this used just to attract the twenty/thirty-something demographics?).Unless you're really curious about the &quot;extras&quot; in the DVD package, check out &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; by John Huston. For better stories/dancing/singing with a similar theme, start with Shirley MacLaine (a real &quot;triple threat&quot;) in &quot;Sweet Charity,&quot; &quot;Can-Can&quot;, or &quot;Irma la Douce.&quot;Almost all fluff and no bite, especially when compared to previous versions of &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; or similarly themed movies.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A11PTCZ2FM2547	"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	To say MOULIN ROUGE is offbeat is stating the obvious.  Kind of like saying that feedlots smell and calculus is hard.  But offbeat describes this film perfectly--a film about the ostentatious Paris underworld of 1899, where finer gentlemen ventured under dark of night to get their kicks at the naughty and bawdy Moulin Rouge.  Expecting a musical with original scores (and there are a few), I instead was hit over the melon with a headscratching montage of Rogers & Hammerstein, Elton John, The Police, Madonna, Marilyn Monroe--even Nirvana.Definitely post-1899 music.Even more bewildering was the cacophony of Saturday morning cartoon sounds, accompanied by disjointed, incoherent, psychedelic editing that made me think Timothy Leary himself had spliced this movie together.What in the heck did I just see?But director Baz Luhrmann must have subliminally sprinkled this film with an intoxicating opiate, because I found myself watching MOULIN ROUGE a second, third, fourth time.  And appreciating it more--simply because of its dynamic uniqueness.  I began to enjoy this movie, to enjoy its almost ingenius irreverence for conventional musicals.Granted, there's nothing unique about the love story (boy-meets-girl/boy-loses-girl/boy-and-girl-reunite-before-tragedy), although Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor give solid performances.  And the music itself is nothing to write home about.  It is the look and feel of MOULIN ROUGE that gives it its charm and appeal.Approach this movie with an open mind, free any preconceived notions and ideals, and you'll walk away entertained.	4.0	Free Your Mind, If You Can	2003-01-07	74	59	15
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2QKMTVZK2GWIH	dnewman2	"Love him or hate him, you can't deny Aussie director Baz Luhrmann's vaulting ambition which came to eye-popping, quick-cutting, over-the-top fruition in 2001's Best Picture nominee, MOULIN ROUGE!  With the goal of re-inventing the movie musical, as he did Shakespeare in his earlier kinetic interpretation of ROMEO + JULIET, Luhrmann co-wrote (with Craig Pearce) this ultimately tragic romance sprinkled with silly comedy, can-can girls and a soundtrack made up of pop songs from Rodgers and Hammerstein to Dolly Parton to Nirvana and set in the Bohemian world of the infamous 1899 Paris nightclub that in the director's hands makes Studio 54 look like Romper Room.Ewan McGregor plays Christian, a young (he was probably about 15 years too old for the part), inexperienced British writer who comes to Paris and the wild, sexy, absinthe-tinged world of the Moulin Rouge in search of love and life experience.  As the story is told in flashback, we know from the start he's going to find it, and it's not going to end well.The star of the Moulin Rouge stage is Nicole Kidman's beautiful courtesan, Satine.  When Christian is enlisted by none other than Toulouse-Letrec (John Leguizamo) and his merry prankster sidekicks to write a musical stage spectacular called SPECTACULAR, SPECTATCULAR, Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge (a rollicking Jim Broadbent), mistakes the penniless writer for a rich financier, and Christian finds himself in Satine's opulent boudoir.  Among farcically comic misunderstandings, Christian and Satine fall in love while crooning Elton John and Bernie Taupin's ""Your Song"" in the most starry-eyed of the film's dazzlingly romanticized musical number.But everything in MOULIN ROUGE! is dazzling.  With cinematic influences from Jean Renoir's FRENCH CAN-CAN to Max Ophuls' LOLA MONTES to Bob Fosse's CABARET to any number of Bollywood extravaganzas, Baz Luhrmann pumps up the visual and aural volume to eleven and pretty much pulls it off.  Backed by production designer and co-costume designer Catherine Martin, who walked off with the film's two Oscars, and Don McAlpine's stunning Oscar-nominated cinematography, Baz Luhrmann's colorful vision practically pops off the screen.Kidman (nominated for Best Actress) and McGregor make an appealing couple, and their heartfelt handling of the film's musical numbers is surprisingly effective if not always technically perfect.  The staging and choreography is fresh and exciting (though a bit ADD over-edited), and by the time Satine's tuberculosis brings the film to its inevitable tragic-opera denouement, you know that this filmmaker has taken you on a one-of-a-kind cinematic ride."	4.0	An imperfect, dazzling feast	2011-01-26	1	1	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A29VKODW4R5U7W	dooby	I won't be reviewing the movie much except to say that I enjoyed it tremendously. The music, the choreography and the sets were wonderful.I will just say a few things about the DVD edition. For one thing, it is given in it's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and not cut to 1.85:1 as stated in Amazon's website. It is an anamorphic transfer (enhanced for 16x9 widescreen TVs), although there is no mention of this on the box cover, or anywhere inside for that matter.The casing unfortunately is a flimsy cardboard affair which cracked at the edges when I opened it.The print used for the transfer is practically flawless and the picture quality is generally quite good. There is however quite a bit of edge enhancement seen in various scenes, especially the darker ones.The sound is sumptuous and comes in both 5.1 Dolby Surround and 5.1 DTS.The DVD had a tendency to default to displaying the subtitles when played on my RealMagic Hollywood Plus player but this wasn't a problem on other DVD players.The extras make up the second of this 2 disc set and they alone are worth the price of the DVD. Unfortunately none of the material here has been enhanced for 16x9 TVs. There's a half hour documentary on the making of Moulin Rouge. There are separate interviews with all the main stars. There are full rehearsal sequences for all the major dance numbers. There are also sequences in the choregraphy section, of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman rehearsing their dance routines and clowning around. There are extended sequences for all the major dance numbers and there are multiple camera angle shots for all these numbers. This allows you to view the dances from whatever position you like. Fascinating. Unfortunately the camera angle thingie works in a small window and not full screen.The deleted scenes segment contains alternate sequences for several scenes. The &quot;Come What May&quot; sequence includes scenes of the lovers rowing on a lake and of the them in a hot air balloon a la &quot;Around the World In Eighty Days&quot;. The &quot;Dance Across The Sky&quot; sequence is longer with heavier use of animation. There is also an extended Can Can Sequence and an alternate Green Fairy Sequence.There is also a mini documentary showing Kylie Minogue rehearsing for her role as the Green Fairy. This is tucked away under the &quot;Design&quot; section in a sub-section under that titled &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot;.There are numerous other short documentaries on the special effects, costumes, artwork etc used to create the show and tonnes of photographs.The music videos section includes a glorious full screen version of the Lady Marmalade music video which has razor sharp images compared to some of the other material here. There is also a live performance of Lady Marmalade taken from the MTV Awards which looks soft and almost blurry by comparison. After that there is a letterbox version of the &quot;Come What May&quot; video, the one featuring the insistent underlying thumping rhythm. For those who don't like this version, you can go to the Japanese Movie Trailer (it's in english) which features &quot;Come What May&quot; with a standard orchestral accompaniment.This DVD release is fully packed and aside from the edge enhancement problem would be fully worthy of five stars.	5.0	This Is One Fully Packed DVD	2001-12-05	3	3	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3W0S9MR4A959D	dramadude 186	Back in the days before Chicago came out and blew us all away, musical theatre afficionadoes like myself pretty much had no choice but to watch Moulin Rogue if we wanted to see a movie musical made in the past twenty years.  I must admit that my initial impression of the film was none too flattering.  The first thirty minutes or so of the film make a good case for how MTV has killed movie making, cutting so frequently that the viewer is merely disoriented.  If a movie could have ADD, this movie would be the poster child for such a condition.Yet as the movie progressed, it began to grow on me when it finally slowed down enough to focus on the love story between Nicole Kidman and Euan McGregor.  By the second hour the movie found its stride, combining colorful theatrics with some heart-wrenching drama.  By the end, I was throughly involved in this tale of love and loss in turn of the century Paris and only regretted the movie hadn't come together sooner.In the lead roles, Euan McGregor and Nicole Kidman do excellent work.  Kidman's singing voice isn't the greatest, but she acts her part so well that her thin-voiced singing ends up not mattering.  Plus, you gotta give the girl credit for doing all her own vocals instead of having them dubbed over by someone else.  She fully commits the role, and although she didn't (and shouldn't) win the Oscar she certainly earned a spot among the nominees.  Euan McGregor, on the other hand, has a spectacular singing voice, and I for one was amazed by his range and versatility.  Like Kidman, he is totally commited to the part, and the two share an undeniable chemistry.Moulin Rouge's flawed first half keep it from greatness, but Baz Luhrmann definitely gets points for trying.  He also gets points for making a movie musical when it wasn't the in thing (or even the financial sound thing) to do.  In a sense, Moulin Rouge paved the way for Chicago and hopefully other movie musicals to follow.  Although Chicago is a better film, Moulin Rouge certainly has its moments and is overall a very satisfying piece of cinema.	4.0	Worth It For the Second Half	2004-08-12	1	0	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ABL1Z5LJKDDFJ	Dr. Evil (drevilslair@yahoo.com)	"First the good-the set design is very good, and if Moulin Rouge wins an Oscar for Art Direction/Set Direction, or for Costume Design, those awards will be deserved.  There, that didn't take long...I'll admit that I was turned off when I heard Christian singing the line ""The hills are alive..."", but I let it slide initially.  But when I then heard the throng at Moulin Rouge singing Nirvana's ""Smells like Teen Spirit"" in unison, I was disgusted.  Most of the reviewers have defended this move, saying it was ""original"" and helped resurrect the musical.  Well, don't most musicals use their own original numbers? And if not, don't the musicals at least use contemporary music? The reason I'm fiercely criticizing the musical numbers (especially the use of Nirvana), is that these numbers, when you listen to the lyrics, simply do not transport you to 1900's Paris.  Granted, Baz Luhrmann's Paris is a fictional Paris, but if you're going to use a set period piece, at least use music that evokes that time period.I do enjoy good love stories, but unfortunately I was not convinced by this one.  This is not the fault of the two actors, but Luhrmann's constant refusal to have a steady shot for longer than two seconds throughout the movie derails the love story.  This is unfortunate, because I think both actors (Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman) are very good and deserving of a better script.  I hope they're given the chance in a future film with a better love story and director.  The love story is trite-it's not a major criticism, but combined with the aforementioned criticisms it sinks the love affair.This ""musical"" is an artsy form of an MTV production.  I have to agree with an earlier review who termed Moulin Rouge a feature-length MTV video.  I believe that the musical can make a revival, but not based on this ....  If you want to see a true musical, see ""Singing In the Rain"", ""Oklahoma"", or the underrated ""Meet Me in St.Louis""."	1.0	Oscar nom. for Best Picture?

But after seeing this film I have to say I really missed out. The thing that was drawing about Moulin Rouge is the fact that the actors of the film are not known for their musical skills, well that's my opinion and my knowledge of the people in the showbiz world amounts to a little more than nil. However after hearing Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sing bankable songs and music that I'm soooo familiar with, I was just hooked. I guess that's what I liked about it and the story line was so well if I can say &quot;believable&quot; because life can be so tragic. Ok-OK not always.Well to cut my rambling short - it was touching, and very entertaning. I hope you go and see it or even own a copy to make it part of the archives of great musicals.To the makers and actors of the film - you did a great job, be proud - Come what may.	4.0	Surprisingly entertaining	2001-12-21	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1SI5TSEAADQS	"Dusty Kothenbeutel ""World's Best Mashed Potat..."	Moulin Rouge is one of those movies that really stands out from the crowd, for its sheer uniqueness and for being highly-stylized. Being absolutely hilarious is a plus too!I am a fan of Baz Luhrmann movies, because they present a modernized yet over-the-top fantasy world that refuses to apologize for itself. If you liked his modernized version of Romeo + Juliet, you'll love Moulin Rouge, it's even better and much wilder.There are SO many lyrical references to other songs in this movie, that it might take dozens of repeat viewings to try and catch them all. And the way that lyrics are blended into dialogue is unprecedented and one of the best parts of the movie.If you liked other highly-stylized movies such as Sin City or 300, you will also like Moulin Rouge.If you like movie-musicals that blend moviemaking techniques with stage performance, such as Chicago, you will definitely like this one too.Overall the movie is just too creative and artistic to be easy to describe, so I'm just going to tell you to go see it. As long as you let go of any expectation of realism, just sit back and enjoy the hilarious and heartwrenching show.	5.0	Very Bizarre and Thoroughly Entertaining	2007-05-08	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A20KFJ5RIZ0ELW	Eddie Munster	Never had a chance to see it in the Theater and only recently got to see it on this DVD - it is spectacular. The editing is, at times dizzying to say the least and there are some great numbers that are voiced over by other cast but all in all it works. The plot is formulaic but with enough creative twists that it breathes life into the story line. Cinematography, casting & nearly every score are five stars. Who knew Nicole Kidman & Ewan McGregor could sing ? Passionate, entertaining and evocative-by-moral of a really amazing time in Parisian Theater.	5.0	Spectacular . . .	2012-11-09	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A27LE5555J8X0I	"""eddiesbloodbrother"""	I must say being such a metalhead I am, I never thought in all my life that I would like such a movie like this.  Really just because I cant stand musicals, but this one kept me going for some reason, i went on and rented the movie because I heard some people say it was good, and Iv always been a big fan of Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor, as well as John Leguizamo. And wow the stars Nicole and Ewan actually sing, they have such outstanding voices.  Give this movie a chance its actually well worth it, and what is really outstanding is the layout, the scenory, maybe the best picture of the year as well.  If you dont even like the film, its worth watching just to look at the background of the beautiful perfect city as well as the night time sky, enjoy it and give it a better chance.  Personally I dont think anyone should hate this movie, if you do, try to watch it again.	4.0	I was quite impressed	2001-12-20	3	3	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2X1YICCYD273E	EDER	this movie has got to be one of the best movies ever but even the best movie can fall short if it is not released as it should.Casing 5: the casing is really red and it folds out telling you its a celebration of freedom, beauty, truth and love so you know what the movie is about.Special features (disc 1) 5: it is nice to see the making of the film moulin rouge as you watch it(not for 1st time viewers). the green fairy will show you what an effort it was to make MR. i feel sad that they didnt have the laguage option in french. but spanish works too.(disc 2) 5: i love being in charge of the multi angle dance scenes. the easter eggs let you peek in some more into the making of the film. there is an interview with baz that shows you what MR was going to be(trust me it wouldve been a twisted musical).Film itself 5: you cant do an better than moulin rouge, not even chicago. this movie makes you wanna jump up and sing (which i admit to). it is simply a spectacular ride from begining to end.pros: the color makes you feel alive and you get sucked into the movie. the dancing is just fabulous.cons: people might not like the updated songs in a movie taking place in parisian 1899. also if you are watching it in spanish audio when they start singing its in english and this becomes annoying but other than that it is a quintessential musical to have besides the rocky horror.	5.0	Must Have	2004-05-04	2	1	1

It's anime! The entire movie is a phenomenal roller coaster, a feast of eye candy, a hauntingly tender love story, a masterpiece. The skillful blending of contemporary music, images and film making with the fresh-coat-of-paint-grotesquery of Paris circa 1900 is stunning, and the love story is pure enough to break the coldest of hearts.Make no mistake, this is an art film and should not be seen if you are in the mood for Indiana Jones or Basic Instinct. Additionally, we have had several friends borrow our copy of the DVD and HATED it because they watched it on really small televisions. I think that it should be seen on a large screen with a reasonable sound system or it may come across just a little too frenetic. We have a 53"" 6x9 with surround that does the film justice. The sound is marvelous.My wife and I think that this piece could be described like this: a turn-of-the-century Parisian Romeo and Juliet produced by MTV and directed by the same person who did the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A29EW6FITI2SS4	edzaf	I find it amusing that so many people are only rating and reviewing the film &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; here.  This is a film where there is little room for shades of gray - you either love it or hate it.  If you did not see this film in the theaters, by all means go to you local rental store and take the DVD home for a night or two before buying it here on Amazon.  If your brain warps or your eyes roll back into your head or you are beset with moans or giggles, be thankful that you only spent a couple of dollars on the rental and proceed on with your life (don't worry I hear the recovery time is relatively short).  If this is not the case, by all means, buy this DVD and immerse yourself in the lavish treatment the film receives in this 2-disc set.Director Baz Luhrmann has simply created one of the most impressive DVD packages on the market today.  There are so many extras (deleted scenes, extended dance sequences, music videos, hundreds of still photos) that it would be difficult to list them all out without exceeding the 1000-word limit for reviews.  Although the DVD contains two separate audio commentary tracks, one small quibble is that neither contains any from the actors.  Nevertheless, it is a disc that you will pop into the DVD player time and time again.  This is the reason to buy any DVD in the first place, right?  If all these features are possibly not enough, fifteen &quot;easter eggs&quot; are hidden on Disc 2 with more brief behind-the-scenes snippets.  Is this all excessive?  Sure!  But would we expect anything less from Luhrmann who already showed us how over-the-top he likes to go with his previous film &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;?  But there is no denying his passion and this DVD is certainly a love letter to the filmmaking process.  The &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; DVD is exhaustive -- but just may leave you wonderfully breathless!	5.0	Oui Oui for Moulin Rouge!	2001-12-28	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1FG3A3V5IAEG9	"E. Frampton ""Parandot"""	Well here it is, the followup to Romeo + Juliet that I have been waiting for for 5 years.  Baz Luhrmann, the posterchild for hyperactive filmmaking is back at it again.  This time he is making a musical in his own unique or sick (depending on your perspective) sort of way.  His style consists of cut after cut, visual upon visual, brain overload filmmaking.  Taking it all in is next to impossible, but that's what's great about it, multiple viewings are a must.  I was having doubts about this movie just because it took so long to make.  In the end though, I wasn't disappointed by this movie at all, it is a singular piece of work that actually got me emotionally involved in the story.  I can't say that about much these days, let alone a Hollywood film.  Ewan and Nicole strike up a real chemistry, and their voices are surprisingly good.  The anachronistic music scenes are typical Baz: huge sets, outlandish costumes, insane camerawork, it's all here.  It's anything but boring, and all a bit overwhelming.  It's hard not to get caught up in the spectacle of it all.  The story is in the typically melodramatic musical mold.  Good vs. Evil, good guy vs. Bad Guy, love conquers all type of stuff.  But it's done with such pizazz, and outright insanity that I was enthralled and I guarantee you will be too.  You might just want to take a trip to the Moulin Rouge.	4.0	Diamonds are a girls best friend	2001-10-12	0	0	0

Then, I got the movie on the 2-disc DVD release. After watching it, the movie, as well as the DVD, turn out to become one of my favorite titles for all time!The cinematography is spectacular. Colour is vivid. Scenes are stunning. And songs are wonderful too. I particularly like the part where Ewan McGregor is singing &quot;Your Song&quot; at Nicole Kidman's bedroom. It's simply awesome! Because of this song, I also bought its soundtrack (this song is located at Track 6), which is a must-have if you like the movie like me. :)This DVD title is feature-packed.

Her singing voice is pleasant as is Ewan McGregor's (but I wouldn't recommend that they switch careers).About the direction: quite frankly, some of it made me a bit dizzy.  I understand that the director wanted to make the scene seem more &quot;fast-paced,&quot; etc., but when the audience feels a bit queezy, that is not such a good thing.Bottom line: rent it, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.	3.0	An Okay Movie	2002-03-14	7	4	3

I had wanted to see it in the theater, but it wasn't a movie my husband was interested in watching.  I should have followed his instincts.I just finished watching this movie, and I can sum up my feelings in one word- ugh.  After the first 13 minutes, I almost turned it off, but I managed to hang through until the end.  I had a hard time putting some of the names with the characters- I still can't tell you what the owner's name was.  That led to confusion when I kept hearing names but didn't know how to link them up with anyone.  I also didn't like the number of fantasy scenes- I don't mind the ocassional &quot;daydream&quot; type sequence, but an elephant house in front of the Moulin Rouge that the dancers use to entice their men?  It was just too much for me.  Additionally, I didn't like that you know what happens to Satine as soon as the movie starts.  A little mystery can be nice.All my feelings aside, I did like the costumes.  Visually, the movie was beautiful, and that's where the 2 stars come from.  I also liked how modern music was worked into the film.  There are also some parts which are funny and cute, like the scene in the elephant where the gang improvises a number in order to sell the Duke on the idea of Spectacular Spectacular.  Also, Nicole Kidman is a surprisingly good singer- she does her own lyrics in the movie's numerous vocal events.I like movies that go out on the edge, but I guess I'm just not artsy enough to like this one.	2.0	Skip this one	2002-03-02	11	5	6

Moulin Rouge is a spectacular film. It's not only the best musical that I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies. The comedy in this film is just so fast and off the wall I found myself laughing because I just didn't know what the heck was going on! The musical arrangements of modern popular songs was pure genius and the dances were out of this world. Everything about this film was perfect, from the little conductor directing the 20th Century Fox theme to the grainy spotlight of the memorial at the very end. After the movie ended, it took a minute and a half for people to start moving; it's just that hard-hitting.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2KB14WCZ1DVE3	elvistcob@lvcm.com	"I hate sampling, which is the practice of taking a small cut of another hit, putting it in ""your"" song, and getting more mileage out of it.  It seems to be popular, and even the original artist gets paid off in royalties.So in this world of sampling in recordings, and ""live"" performances that are lip-synched, we have now entered the era of the sampled movie.  I seem to be in the minority with this one, but I was turned off by most of the movie, and the biggest issue is the sampling.  I keep reading that this is a triumph for the Oscars in that the musical is now being recognized again.  In my eyes, if you are going to make a musical, try writing some original songs that people like.  Don't take other songs, and in many cases, just parts of popular songs to pander to the MTV-generation.Another problem is Nicole Kidman.  Here she is, once again as a cold-as-ice man manipulator.  I think she's a terrific actress, and the role certainly called for it, but I'm just getting sick of her cast this way.  Is she capable of playing someone tender?  I buy Ewan McGregor acting like a puppy dog around her, but I don't believe for a moment that she has a thing for him.Speaking of guys acting like puppy dogs, at least he has somewhat pure, if naive motives.  The rest of the film treats sex in that leering, sniggering, teasing way that Hollywood loves to stretch the boundaries of.  I know the movie is supposed to be creating the fantasy of what the place was marketing, but I don't need it thrown in my face.  The final straw was the master of ceremonies sampling, er singing ""Like a Virgin"" to the Duke surrounded by mincing butlers.I threw in an extra star because the movie does have great sets, costumes, and a lot of work was done on the choreography.  I liked the director's previous stuff (""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"").  I'm sure the extremes they take this style to are intentional, and I admire the risk-taking, but once again, try writing some new songs if you want to call your movie a musical."	2.0	Sampling comes to the movies	2002-03-13	13	10	3
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3MLE9KU0LV7ST	Emily	I have always loved musicals, and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is my favorite, so when the first song in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was &quot;The Hills Are Alive With the Sound of Music,&quot; I knew I was going to love it. The music spoke to me about love and hope. Just listening to it makes me happy. I was amazed at the singing talents of both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, who until now I had only known as excellent actors. This movie brings to life the Moulin Rouge in all it's overdone magnificence, from the costumes to the brilliant musical numbers. I've seen this movie twice already, and I can't wait to see it again.

It's amazing eye-popping sets and costumes are extremely well done and portray the feelings and movement in the movie quite beautifully.Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor shine as the parts of Satine and Christian. This movie showed the amazing emotion both are able to act out and the incredible diversity in their acting. I was amazed to find out that McGregor has a breath-taking voice and Kidmans is more than decent. This movie made me, one, have an enormous crush on the sexy, smooth and sweet McGregor and two, realize how great of an actress Kidman is. I've since become a huge fan of hers.The music in this movie is unbelivable as well. The way songs from the past were used and remixed was genius. They could not have picked a better compilation of tunes to carry out the story. I can't even describe the feelings that emerge when they belt out the Elephant Love Song Medley or Roxanne. The two Moulin Rouge cds are on constant rotation in my car, my room and my headphones.I strongly urge you all to see this movie. I think it's one of the greatest cinematic achievements to have come along in a very long time. I really believe you'll love it as much as I do. :o)	5.0	Made me love movies again	2002-10-06	1	1	0

It&#65533;s not often that all of this elements can come together to make a film as touching, original, and heartfelt as &#65533;Moulin Rouge&#65533;.  I hope that &#65533;Moulin Rouge&#65533; will get the Oscar nominations that it deserves!  &#65533;Moulin Rouge&#65533; really does deserve a &#65533;Best Picture&#65533; nomination.I had no idea that Nicole Kidman had such a great voice.  If she ever dropped acting, she could most defintely pursue a singing career.  I was already aware of Ewan McGregor&#65533;s amazing voice because of his small singing bit in &#65533;Emma&#65533;.  I was overjoyed to be able to hear him sing again!In order to enjoy this masterpiece, you have to accept Baz Luhrmann&#65533;s uniqueness and just let him take you to another world in order to enjoy &#65533;Moulin Rouge&#65533; to its fullest.  I must admit, the first fifteen minutes were a little strange to me, probably because I was so shocked to see something like this!  The movie does get better if you don&#65533;t like the first fifteen minutes.  Baz Luhrmann&#65533;s cleverly angled camera shots and neat film editing make &#65533;Moulin Rouge&#65533; a movie to remember.Moulin Rouge is unlike anything I have ever seen before.'This story is about...love...at the Moulin Rouge'  ~Christian 'Moulin Rouge'	5.0	~*~TRUTH~*~*~BEAUTY~*~*~FREEDOM~*~*~LOVE~*~	2001-08-09	15	13	2

I did find the ending kinda similar to Titanic, and while I did enjoy poking a little fun at their misfortune, at no point was I not in tears at how heart wrenching it was! This movie states a very valuable lesson within the first five minutes! ""The greatest thing is to love and be loved in return."" Call me a romantic (cause I am) but it's very poignant. My only criticism, and this was not important enough to detract from the rating I gave it; was that the songs were indeed, not original.

I went and saw this by myself, and I was so involved in the movie that I couldn't believe it when it was over.  Two hours didn't feel like it.  Every minute of the movie is filled with something.  When it first started I was thinking what the heck am I watching, then it all comes together. The music is really good and who knew that Ewan Mcgregor could sing like that??  Not just a good looking actor but a singer as well.  I have never experienced a movie like that before in my life.

All the talk about &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; bringing back the musical genre is a bunch of hooey. The songs are relatively recent songs originally recorded by Elton John, Madonna, etc., and with these non-singers attempting them adds even more irritation to watching and listening to this film. The acting is okay, but I don't think it's breakthrough for anyone. After all the hype--and I do like &quot;true&quot; musicals (original songs, etc.)--I was completely disappointed. In fact, I watched it a second time to see if I was missing something. I didn't. Those who praise this movie as a musical haven't seen the great musicals of the past.	1.0	A hodge-podge of stuff!	2002-03-19	19	9	10

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A21P3QYTKXMXFE	Eric G.	Ok, let's be frank: the movie is bad. It is trying to be a serious romantic film and a Disney-like music comedy at the same time, and as could be expected, it does not work.  It ends up being a 2-hour long video clip. As for the story, I don't really have to tell you it's un-original do I?That being said, it does have some good features. At times it manages to be quite funny. Plus the modern music, that we would in other situations dismiss as out of place, actually manages to bring some emotion to the picture; I have to confess I was taken into it....sometimes. The decors are also quite stunning (in spite of their gross anachronism) and the same goes for the costumes. I never really cared for Nicole Kidman before, but I will admit that she is both beautiful and pretty voiced. So is the movie worth seeing? Maybe, if you're looking for a little entertainment. It reminds me of a Kandinsky painting: you wouldn't call it good *art* but it does make for a nice background.	2.0	Some good parts, but pretty bad overall....	2001-10-01	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	"This is one of those movies that I can't help but permanently dislike. It is not necessarily one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but still I was not moved by the film. It's excessively stylish to the point that the visuals don't seem very relevant except for the sole purpose of eye candy. It's not as visually wild as what you would find in Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, but unfortunately it's not as interesting either. The songs.....well, I was hoping for some original music at least. But most of the songs are nothing but pop culture references. If you've heard ""Lady Marmalade"" or ""Smells like Teen Spirit,"" then you will recognize the melodies right away. I did, and I became bored by the fact that these songs have been recycled and added in this movie. It's more like a poor excuse to avoid any musical originality. But I think the biggest problem I have with Moulin Rouge is the melodrama that surrounds the love story. I don't mind love stories in cinema; I mean, I do like Casablanca and Edward Scissorhands. But this is more of a soap opera. It's so sappy and so overdone, that I couldn't really care for both Satine & Christian. The ending was pretty powerful, though.I didn't hate everything about Moulin Rouge. There are some cleverly funny moments, and I did like Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo's performances. The song ""Spectacular Spectacular"" is very amusing to listen to, and some of the visuals are indeed fascinating to look at. But in the end, I can't really admire the film because of what is mentioned above. It's not really special, at least to me.Grade: D+"	2.0	I have to give this film a low grade	2010-02-28	7	1	6
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A29VUWV08CMHG0	Erin	The thing about Moulin Rouge is you have to see it twice.  You also have to get through the first half hour.  Everybody keeps saying how they could only get throug the first 30 minutes before turning it off.  When I first watched it, I sort of had the same feeling, but after you get past that first 30 minutes, you realize how really beautiful it all is.  Even after you are done with the whole movie though, it may seem a little strange.  That's why watching it twice can change your mind.  You know what to expect and you know it's different from most movies.  It also makes more sense because you know what's going on.  This is a movie that you learn to apperciate if anything.	5.0	See It Twice	2003-03-08	2	2	0

The visuals are gorgeous and the pacing is fast and frenetic in a way that you never get bored -- yet it never goes to fast to be moving.Not only do you have the hilarious mixture of modern pop songs (from Madonna, Nirvana, Queen, Police, and even The Sound of Music) mixed into the musical format, but a truly moving story.What's miraculous about it is how it weaves so many things from literatue and art also -- modelled after the style of Bollywood (popular Indian films) and mixed with such allusions to Orpheus in the Underworld myth (the Greek myth where a young lyricist goes into the Underworld to get his lady-love only to lose her by turning around), this movie never fails to move, entertain and make you think.One of my all-time favorite movies!	5.0	Truly unique, modern, unique movie!

I walked out of the theatre half-way through and asked for a refund.After seeing a costume layout of this movie in Vogue magazine, and being an artist, photographer, costume designer and lover of most anything French, I looked forward to seeing this movie, but was sorely disappointed when I did.It's dizzyingly fast paced flash+dash editing made me nauceous.  Not one frame lasts long enough for my eyes to focus.  The songs, many borrowed from other musicals, are presented in half people/ half animation form, and look ridiculous. It seemed like they couldn't decide what they wanted this film to be.The screenplay is based on the story of a real life dancer in Paris, but what is a real tragedy of life cut short is here turned into a comic travesty.The only good thing is that Nicole can actually sing, but her costar cannot.	2.0	a joke	2010-08-22	17	0	17

What strikes me reading these reviews is how Western capitalism is so sneaky. I respond YES that I want and need more in my life beyond illusion. Then I find this way of being in the world so difficult. My teenage daughter is also so bombarded daily with commercial crap. I can either be like Satine and accept it or I can fight it. It's so easy to delude oneself and say, ""OK, I accept this or that material thing but I don't take it to heart"". In my close to 50 years I have learned that this is always a mistake. What brought me to ethical culture to begin with was the realization that I must be profound and have courage in dealing with our American culture. Why do we like Satine so much? Why does Christian fall in love with her? Because diamonds and sex and energy have such an allure! You don't have to be a young person to feel it, either.Thanks."	5.0	Thank you	2004-10-04	5	1	4

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ATE54YI0WTZX6	Fabio	There are a lot of great ideas that inspired Moulin Rouge: a love of musicals, the use of 1900 Paris as the seedy backdrop to a love story, the pairing of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, a love of pop-culture, etc.However, it's totally undermined by editing. The movie depends entirely on &quot;attention deficit&quot; editing - songs are never completed, you never get more than a few seconds of a dance scene, the dialogue goes so fast you can't appreciate anything, etc. At one point, I got dizzy from watching it.I sympathize with those that love the movie's spoectacles,and I myself am a lover of unusual art (like Cecil Taylor's music), but I literally couldn't watch this movie because it made my head spin. I think the director simply went overboard with this one. Some of the jumpy editing may have made it exhilirating, but when the entire movie is that way, most people will leave with a bad taste.So be warned: the movie is very, very jumpy. If you can deal with that, you'll love it. Otherwise, avoid this one.	1.0	Great Idea Undermined by Bad Editing	2002-02-03	16	4	12

This is the kind of film that makes you want to jump up and down, cry, cover your face with a pillow, and feel like the worlds your oyster. I know, that is probably the cheesiest line ever, but this movie has it's cheesy moments as well. Things to look out for are all the great music, maybe not the right time-period, but its the same kind of thing as Marie Antoinette, fun, loud things that bring in a comic air, without being totally over the top. But Moulin Rouge has to have its over the top moments, otherwise it wouldn't go with the Bohemiam Revolution... Beauty, Freedom, Peace and Love. It sounds totally Hippie esque, but after seeing it, you don't have to sleep in a teepee. You just have to jump in front of moving cars, waving pamphlets about how great the red cedars are.But to be honest, the part that really gets you, is that in the very first scene an argentinian falls through the ceiling, and they all start singing the Sound of Music.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2S5CQ07GRC63V	"featherstonhaugh ""featherstonhaugh"""	Take one bag of cliched plotlines, dress it up in saccarine sentiments and hammy acting and some very faux-profound pop lyrics and edit the whole thing to death ... and you end up with Moulin Rouge.When the Ziegler character broke into a chorus of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; I just cringed and wanted to dissapear into my seat. To be totally frank, I couldn't believe what I was watching (&amp; that I'd paid good money for the privilege). I have never been embarrassed by a movie before, but in this case I felt acutely embarrassed for the actor (who looked equally nauseaus even beneath all that hammy acting), the director, the writer (where was the writer, by the way?), the producer, in fact anyone remotely associated with this lurid &amp; misconceived attempt to reinvent the musical genre for the MTV generation.If you want to experience the real depth of emotion created by a musical with brilliant original songwriting &amp; lyrics AND fast-paced set pieces which are slickly edited without giving you a migraine two minutes into the film, watch Lionel Bart's classic 60's musical &quot;Oliver&quot;.And what was with all those double entendres about the size and length of the Ewan McGreggor character's 'you know what'? (&quot;It's very long..&quot; says he to a patently horrified Nicole Kidman). Whoever scripted these gags must have been a ... from The Benny Hill Show. But of course, the poor ... ... audience is expected to find schlong-length jokes absolutely hilarious.Ewan's earnestness as the lovelorn young writer made me want to vomit, not to mention his tendency to break out into saccarine sweet &amp; vapid pop lyrics at every opportunity (I honestly believe we were expected to swallow the &quot;all you need is love&quot; line as though it were the greatest pronouncement on the subject ever passed down to mere mortals). Incidentally, the director wielded the &quot;love&quot; theme about as deftly as a cudgel.Anyway, the anachronism of scoring a musical supposedly set during La Belle Epoch with nothing more original than Madonna/Queen/Elton John covers had me gaping with astonishment and, worse, reflecting sadly on the ultimate 2 dimensionality and emptiness of our own pop/mass media culture versus say, Puccini's treatment of the same subject matter.The mish mash of plotlines borrowed or stolen from greater achievements was so shamelessly done, one realizes that the only way the director could have got away with it was for his audience to be totally clueless. Nicole dying of TB/Struggling bohemians (La Boheme) being but one blindingly obvious ... .... Then you had the sub-Titanic bit at the end where the man servant is running amok with a pistol trying to murder the penniless young artist who stole his master's main squeeze. That was highly original, I must say.Mind you, I strongly applaud the constant focus on Nicole Kidman/Sabine's suspendered thighs. Her thighs were probably the best part of the entire miserable movie and prevented me at more than one point from walking out of the theatre.This is a modern day musical for the kind of people who uncritically believe that Queen are the most profound artists since Leonardo Da Vinci. Horrid childish script lines embarrassingly delivered by actors who - being of higher calibre than this film deserves - ought to have known better. Horrible horrible waste of two hours. It has done irreversible damage to the musical genre.	1.0	A Very Misguided And Misconceived Musical	2001-07-08	24	9	15

I'd rather watch &quot;Singing In The Rain&quot;, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (how DARE Nicole Kidman sing that song!), &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, &quot;Top Hat&quot;, &quot;On The Town&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, etc..etc...I would only recommend enduring this film if you're having company you don't really like and you want to get rid of them early, just pop it in. A visual feast that will leave you not only hungry, but wretching. HATED it!	1.0	Cacophonous Calamity.	2003-02-13	46	18	28
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3RQ9A9PRWZXAL	findkeep@eburg.com	"Moulin Rouge hearkens back to a time when movies had the fresh feeling of adolescence, intoxicated by their own possibilities.  It's a deliciously offbeat film, completely aware of its own audacity.  Not only does it reestablish the movie musical with verve and sincerity, but it does so in a unique and defining way.  By mixing turn-of-the-century and contemporary icons, the craziness of the Moulin Rouge is updated for today's desensitized viewers, giving us an idea of just how liberating and frightening it must have been to visit that infamous dance hall all those years ago.  It really ""Smells Like Teen Spirit.""Christian (Ewan McGregor) comes to the Paris of 1899 an idealistic youth, searching for the materialization of his firm beliefs in truth, freedom, beauty, and love.  Like a prodigal son he strays to the forbidden world of the Moulin Rouge, a decadent world of sex, glamour, prostitution, and bohemian indulgence.  It is there, through the frenetic tempo of extravagant sets and costumes, that he finds Satine (Nicole Kidman) a beautiful but jaded courtesan.  Falling into a boyish infatuation, Christian confronts Satine, realizing his love, and her's in return.  But their hope is dwindled, as Satine has sold her body in contract to the terrible Duke.  Besides that, she is embittered with a horrible and ultimately tragic secret.The story is clich&eacute;d to be sure (it's similarities to Camille often make you wonder if writers weren't merely using an old clich&eacute;, but an old movie), but it seems to work, if only because of director Baz Luhrman's wholehearted belief in its values.  He digs down into the deeply hidden heart of his story, replacing the dirt of a hundred cheap melodramas with a visual artistry unrivaled by anything in years.  In this way it expresses the sincere, almost raw emotion these stories once contained in a completely new way.  Did we say completely new way?!The visual artifice of Moulin Rouge is astoundingly fresh!  It's painterly but kinetic in a way only a movie could be.  The fabulous choreography, music, set design, performances... all blend to form a visual, aural, and emotional experience like no other!  It has the Technicolor richness of a 50's Hollywood musical, but often the feel of a music video.  The visual style ranges from somber pop-up book, to giddy cartoon, to lilting romantic dreamworld, to fantastic Bollywood production, and everything fits!  That director Luhrman has managed to bring this all to the screen with such clarity is somewhat astonishing.But of course we could not write a review of Moulin Rouge without mentioning the bizarre choice of music.  Luhrman has unusual confidence in his eccentricities.  But then again who else could take ""Roxanne"" and turn it into a beautiful, erotic, haunting tango?  And who knew ""Like a Virgin"" as sung by Jim Broadbent could serve as a goosepimply, if ironically bitter, release?Of course it could also help that most of these songs are sung by the rapturous voices of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.  Their performances are beautiful and sincere, particular Ewan's (that I feel the need to call him by his first name only proves how close to him I became).  He becomes his role with unbelievable passion and heart.  He has a bit of something that goes beyond acting, he has the magic of a great performance.  He can embody youth, charming goofiness, and shattered idealist, and if he wasn't in love with Nicole Kidman!  All this he expresses with an absolutely angelic singing voice (even its occasional weaknesses serve as charming strengths).  You fall in love not only with him, but for him.  The Academy not honoring him with at least a nomination would be a great disappointment.Nicole Kidman is both sexy and beautiful, like the film itself a daring blend of old and new.  She's part 30's glamour queen, part pop star, a little Marlene Dietrich, a little Madonna.  When discussing Moulin Rouge I've found that many would not see it solely because Nicole was in it, and this is sad.  Her performance here is excellent, displaying her full range of talents.  She expresses her usual cool seductiveness, but also a surprising comic flair, and at times an aching emotion.  And did we mention her singing?  Like Ewan, Nicole has a hidden vocal talent.  Her voice puts resounding meaning into something that was once just something dumb on the radio.  Her efforts have resulted in numerous awards, including a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, and at least and Oscar nomination is certainly on its way.The way all these unique visuals, and performances are organized is also extremely unique.  The editing style has been criticized as frenetic, and poorly structured, but I would have to disagree.  If one watches this film carefully enough they with realize that each cut serves in the dance, by punctuating each note.  This becomes most apparent in the previously mention Tango de Roxanne, one of the many brilliantly choreographed, grandiose dance numbers.  As the momentum and emotion expressed by the dance and song builds, the editing follows, rapidly increasing in cuts until finally bursting like a heart overwhelmed by its own beating.  Similarly, when Christian first enters the Moulin Rouge the frightening madness of it all is perfectly captured by Luhrman's crazed scissors.That Moulin Rouge has completely polarized critics is of no surprise.  A large group of great films have done so, and I think this one is both a socially, and artistically important one.  There are many who have called it a ridiculous piece of ""pop trash.""  What these critics seem to forget is that Astaire and Rogers were the biggest pop icons of their era, and their stories were no more original.  Ok, maybe Ewan and Nicole aren't exactly Fred and Ginger, but you get my point.  Still it is exactly these critics who complain that American film studious never churn out anything original, and then turn to panning a film like this.But regardless of how anyone else sees it, I would call Moulin Rouge a great film, and doubtlessly my favorite of the year.  It is easily deserving of awards in the majority of Oscar categories.  Acting, editing, set and costume design, direction, everything is in its own way unique and beautiful.  It may look like Busby Berkeley on acid, but beneath the extravagance is a beating emotion.  In a film industry dominated by cynicism, it is relieving to find a movie that dares to be sincere.  Say what you will, but this Oscar season I'll be rooting for the most opulent, energetic, emotional, beautiful, brilliant, audacious movie of the year.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3CWH6VKCTJAD	"""flickjunkie"""	"My reaction to the first 15 minutes of this film was, ""Oh, no.  This is going to be a two hour music video, and from the looks of it, it is going to be like MTV on LSD.""  I actually shut it off and went to bed.  I returned the next day and vowed to keep my personal policy never to leave any movie unfinished, no matter how much I dislike it.  I'm glad I have that policy because wow, was my first impression wrong.Baz Luhrmann has delivered us a piece of filmmaking genius with this avant-garde film.  It combines disparate elements that seem incompatible, yet they work magnificently together.  Music video style is combined with the moorings of the traditional theatrical musical to create a piece that is simultaneously revolutionary and old guard.This film is about incongruity.  Modern popular music is woven into a turn of the century story.  The sets, lighting and costumes are designed to create garish color clashes.  The presentation is sometimes camp comedy and at others very straightforward and melodramatic.  Normally, none of these elements work together, but Luhrmann orchestrates them into a symphony of visual and auditory harmony that is nothing short of overwhelming.The story itself is nothing special.  It is an old fashioned tragic love story where true love is pitted against practical realities.  The impoverished writer (Ewan McGregor) loves the courtesan (Nicole Kidman) and she loves him, but the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) desires her and will stop at nothing to get her.  She promises to be with the Duke, and he agrees to fund the ""Spectacular Spectacular"", refurbishing the Moulin Rouge for the event and promising to make her a great star.  She agrees but continues to dally with the writer behind the Duke's back.  Of course, this leads to a confrontation where she must decide between true love and great wealth.The music is outstanding.  The arrangements of familiar pop songs as well as the original music are fantastically done.  The dance and choreography are Broadway quality.  The costumes and sets are, well, Spectacular.  The presentation is sometimes zany and at other times solemn, but always entertaining.  While Luhrmann may not have redefined the movie musical, he has certainly expanded its limits by a couple of galaxies.  In many ways it reminds me of the kind of effect shows like ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""The Wiz"" had on theater, taking risks to go to irreverent places and traverse unspoken boundaries.The acting is terrific.  Ewan McGregor continues to expand his considerable acting talents into new and varied areas, and with each new project shows his adaptability and facility.  In addition to giving a gut wrenching performance as the forlorn writer he also shows a reasonably good singing voice.  However, as good as McGregor is, he is blown off the set by Nicole Kidman.  Kidman astounds with powerful vocals of recording artist caliber that literally raise goose flesh.  Her acting is multi-textured with amazing range, handling the comedy, the romance and the tragedy with equal aplomb.  This is by far her best performance and her shining moment.  Jim Broadbent is phenomenal as the over-the-top owner and ringmaster of the legendary night spot.  The entire cast (especially the dancers) delivers a high energy performance.This film is a treat for anyone who loves theater, popular music, great dance and an old fashioned love story.  I rated it a 10/10.  Yes, it is sappy and silly and overly melodramatic, but it is done with style . . . Spectacularly!"	5.0	A brilliant symphony of incongruities	2002-01-03	7	7	0

The events take place at the turn of the century, a mythical tale of a staid and conservative English boy from London travelling to wild and exotic Paris, in the Montmarte district, to be an artist, and to fall in love.  Aptly named Christian (played by Ewan McGregor, and of course, he will fall from grace and stray from the path), the hero of course becomes involved with the artistic crowd, including Toulouse-Lautrec (played brilliantly by artificially diminutive John Leguizamo).From the beginning, with music from 'The Sound of Music', later joined by the most inventive renderings of hits from Madonna and Elton John (among many, many others), one gets the feeling that real fun was had in the creation of this piece; who would think 'The Hills are Alive' could serve as a quintessential bohemian revolutionary piece?Our hero constantly waxes plagiaristically-poetic on the brilliance of love, and of course, soon finds love, in a tragic and unavailable beauty, the star of the Moulin Rouge (played by Nicole Kidman).  Satine is instead being set up to 'entertain' a Duke, a wealthy financier the nightclub owner Zidler hopes will save his flagging fortunes.  Naturally a mix-up occurs, the young poet being mistaken for the wealthy Duke, and fate is sealed as they fall in love.Satine does a number worthy of Madonna and Marilyn Monroe with a very material-girl 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend'; eventually all falls apart as the identities are resolved, the Duke invests, the hero pens a 'legitimate' musical, but ultimately, all goes tragically awry when love gives way to practical reality and true human conditions.The costumes and settings are over the top in every way - the gray existence is far more gray, the colours far more colourful, and all the music has snap and pop befitting the best of pop music and burlesque.  The choreography is simply amazing, complementing the storyline seamlessly.  The direction is quick and energetic, and editing quite amazing, and the composition/remixing of music together makes this Oscar-winner a real pleasure.The DVD has various extras, behind the scenes interviews with all the major production personnel, from the director and costumer and choreographer to the writers and actors.  There is even a 'Making of...' special produced by HBO that gives much background material.This is a toe-tapping, sing-along, fast-paced film, a real Spectacular, Spectacular!  if ever there were one.

Ewan McGregor was perfect as the man who loves her; he makes this romantic story believable. But I think the main star of this movie is Baz Lurhmann. It is obvious from the very beginning to the last frame of the film that his creativity and talent make this movie so entertaining and so watchable. His choice of music is just right; his use of splashy color and costume sets the tone for the fabulous production numbers; and his sense of humor along with his sense of romance just brings this movie to life. It is just incredible to me that he was not nominated for an Academy Award for his direction of this film. There just aren't that many movies this clever and this entertaining in theaters today. Yes, there are movies that are good for many different reasons, but Lurhmann goes the extra mile to give his audience something that isn't going to be duplicated anywhere else.

After renting the movie, I was sure I would never watch it again, but I was drawn back to it by the soundtrack, which is hands down the best part of the movie. I ended up first buying the soundtrack and then the movie, which I watched over and over and over again.Moulin Rouge is the third in Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain trilogy, where he has told stories through three mediums: through dance in Strictly Ballroom, through Shakespearean poetry in Romeo and Juliet, and through music in Moulin Rouge. And this story is definitely told through the music. The most important moments in the movie occur during musical numbers. And at first I was turned off by the fact that there is only one original song in the soundtrack, ""Come What May,"" I finally realized that they were trying to show the genius of Ewan MacGregor's character, the young writer, by having him pen some of the greatest songs of the 20th century.Everything else about this movie is fantastic as well. The story takes place in late 19th century Paris, where a young Engish writer (MacGregor) just moved to ""live a penniless existence"" and write about freedom, beauty, truth and love. He is discovered by a group of Bohemian actors and asked to write a play for the Moulin Rouge. He falls in love with the star of his play (Nicole Kidman), but they are forced to have a secret affair because she is the ""property"" of the play's investor.Kidman and MacGregor do an awesome job. I was especially impressed that they used their own vocals. If I had not known they were singing, I would have thought their voices had been dubbed.You should definitely rent this movie and give it a try. And try not to write it off after you see it once.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1L3E4ZLRNKFNP	Gary	Once in a while, a movie will come along that stays with you long after you watch it.  It'll take you and send you through a thrilling emotional roller coaster ride.  You become deeply attached with the characters and care about them as if they were your own family, and you remain highly anticipated of what's next all the way through.  Moulin Rouge, starring the elegant and graceful Nicole Kidman along with the fresh and vibrant Ewan McGregor, highly impacted me in so many positive and surprising ways.  From the trailers, this movie didn't strike me as anything worthwhile, but after renting the DVD, I loved it and decided to purchase it immediately.  It was indeed one of the best purchases for a DVD that I have ever made.  I was satisfied and beyond in so many ways.The story is quite simple.  Satine, played by Nicole Kidman, is a courtesan at the Moulin Rouge.  She's an entertainer and an aspiring actress.  Through a fortunate incident, she meets Christian, played by Ewan McGregor, who is an apsiring writer.  These two immediately recognize and can't deny their feelings for one another, but things become complicated.  Satine realizes that she can't allow herself to fall in love because it could deeply affect her work.  Despite this, Christian manages to convince her that their love can overcome any of life's barriers.  Christian's powerful quote, &quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return,&quot; basically sums up the whole concept of the movie.  Moulin Rouge tells a story of two doomed and star-crossed lovers who find their way to one another and showcases their trials and tribulations surrounding their forbidden love.  Another interesting fact about this film, is that the story is told amazingly through song.The DVD is one of the best releases of all time, in my honest opinion.  The first disc includes the feature film, along with commentary and a few other goodies.  The second disc, however, contains most of the juicy extras.  There are music videos, behind the scenes featurettes, trailers, multimedia galleries, etc.  There are hours of enteratining extras on this DVD.  It informs you of the long process of making this movie, and how everything came into its right place to produce one of the best movies of all time.  If you haven't seen Moulin Rouge, I strongly request that you do so now, and if you have seen it but don't yet own the DVD, you're missing out on a fantastic treat.	5.0	One of the Best	2002-06-29	5	4	1

I originally heard about how original and inspired the conversation had become a few years ago in a local bullitin. That all seems to have died down.I am an old Hollywood insider. I did production work in the 50s and 60s. Things have changed but some things have not. I am fascinated by the discussion of religion and eastern mysticism and what not. My master agreed with most of it actually.My problem is that no one is talking about how this movie plays with time and nostaglia. Very basically, it is an attempt to clothe nostaglia in new sounds and costumes. We are taken back in time and it seems like we're there for the first time. That is a technique that is done very well and not often discussed.Thank you for your time.	5.0	Back to the Past, Into the Future	2005-03-06	3	3	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A10WPUU3K8BRDH	gen m.	i was merely intrigued when i saw this movie at our local movie-renting place about two months ago, so my dad rented it for me.i thought it would be a pleasant romp thought nineteenth-century montmartre.  boy was i wrong!it is the delicious, over-the-top, all-singing, all-dancing story of christian and satine and their love.  a brash, electrifying journey through the moulin rouge, a high-end whorehouse where the rich would come to play.ewan mcgregor is, in a word: amazing.  his voice, his accent, his acting ability.  he is the ultimate embodiment of christian.and what can i say about nicole kidman that hasn't been said before?  she has a beautiful voice, and was the perfect casting choice as satine.i cannot stop watching this movie.  i only wish i had seen it in the theatres!  the DVD more than makes up for that, however.  a lush two-disc set, it boasts an impressive &quot;behind the red curtain&quot; feature that informs the viewer how a certain scene was made as well as everything from interviews with cast members to the music video for the ever-popular &quot;lady marmalade&quot; (which, incidentally, was, in my opinion, the only drawback to the film).there are cut scenes, director commentary, stories on how &quot;moulin rouge&quot; came to be, etc, etc...baz luhrmann is a genius for having put this film together and for not caring about the critiscm (totally unwarranted, if i may say so) it received, and will probably continue to receive.if you enjoy your more run-of-the-mill musicals, i doubt this film will interest you.  however, if you have an open mind and are willing to experience something new, this film is for you.if i could give it ten stars, i would! =)	5.0	breathtaking!	2002-02-03	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ATFNT456Z3N64	Geno	This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it in Texas and fell in love with it. I have seen the actual Moulin Rouge in Paris (simply driving by, not actually seeing the show) which was very exciting. This movie is fabulous, the best movie in a long time! It's really fast paced, which I really liked. It's such an exciting movie and even keeps you interested in the slower parts. I reccomend this movie to anyone. It's true, you either gotta love it or you gotta hate it, your choice. You should watch this movie with an open mind, it's great. I wasn't so sure about it at first, but as it turns out I really enjoyed it! I love Kylie as the Green Fairy. It's really an artistic movie, one that really has to be appreciated. THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME! TWO THUMBS WAY WAY UP! Enjoy!	5.0	Baz Lurhmann - The Genius!	2002-12-23	2	0	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3R4S8LQWJWWLU	George Viscas	Being an Australian I do feel somewhat like a Benedict Arnold in saying that I feel that &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is definately for me, one of the worst musicals ever made, yet one of the most arresting films to watch. The sets are dazzling and the performances by everyone;Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor et all, are quite wonderful. Some of the dance and singing performances are not only unique,but extremely energetic and on a technical level, the camera moves are extremely breathtaking. So what's my problem? First of all, Bazz Luhrman has already taken what he did with his wonderful version of &quot;La Boheme&quot; and put it into &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. In other words, I'd seen it before. Secondly,it's plot of the consumptive heroine played by Kidman, is just another &quot;La Traviata&quot; or &quot;Camille&quot; plot, with no differences at all.In other words once again, I'd seen it all before. Although putting in music and songs by Elton John in a piece set during the Nineteenth Century is certainly original, Luhrman for me, ruins the effect by being a Showman far too much with his ever moving camera at dazzling speed and veracity,that seems to take over the plot almost completely. The editing of all the songs is done to the abhorrid style of MTV. In other words, all show and no substance. This is my main concern about this movie. All show with little if any substance. The plot is extremely thin which is covered over by technical razzamataz trying to cover its thiness. Pity it wasn't the other way round. As it stands, it's like fairy floss. Good to look at,but ultimately the sugar is too strong and gets in the way of a healthy bite.	2.0	Spoilt By MTV	2001-10-23	12	3	9

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A16956RUW62IUQ	"Gerald Sioco ""jigsss"""	This two-disc special of Moulin Rouge DVD is definitely worth buying, more so if you love the movie and the brilliant direction of Baz Luhrman.  A lot of people have been comparing this movie to Chicago.  On my opinion, the music of Moulin Rouge is definitely much beautiful than the former.  The acting were incredibly superb and everything was just plain visual illusion.  Moulin Rouge is simply a feast to the eyes.  Very entertaining and alive.This DVD has the best features in the movie.  It was like Criterion who produced it.  I liked the poster gallery, the part where Kylie Minogue was doing her scenes, and a lot more that I've forgotten because they're just all great.  The DVD pack is complete, too complete in fact, you wouldn't ask for more.	5.0	Amazing movie packed with a number of features	2003-07-10	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2XFPZALXUU4K1	"Gerard Sison ""gerard_sison"""	You either love it or you hate it.I loved it.From the opening frame to the very end. This film is packed with surprises. Wasn't really too keen on watching it and just did so cuz my friends met up with me. But when the Fox logo shows in tin-type with a &quot;Sound of Music&quot; incidental music, I realized I was up for a treat!I'm not a fan of MTV but I must say, I enjoyed this one with its quick cuts, angles,  and all. Just don't sit too close to the screen or you could get a headache. Or a nosebleed. The colors! the angles, the quick cuts. Wild!The songs just sneak up on you and you can't help but giggle or let out a guffaw. It's really quite clever. Haven't had this much fun in years. In fact, don't remember ever watching a musical in the movie house that was this fun! It feels like a broadway play. But the songs are not only memorable, you actually remember hearing them before! Evita the movie, I didn't enjoy too much. This one I liked.Being a singer myself (modesty aside), Ewan M.'s singing isn't the most accomplished, but I must say, it worked really well with the material. He really conveyed his emotions well into the songs, with a clear, easy-to-listen-to voice. I know I actually can sing better, but I was so caught up in it, I actually found myself wishing I could sing as well as he did! And to be in love like him!As for Nicole, all I can say is Tom Cruise is a dud! I absolutely fell in love with her. She will remain a Major Star without him! Absolutely luminous, you can tell why all of Paris was falling for her character. I can see what different generations could see in Ana Held, Marilyn Monroe, Madonna. But she can stand up to them anytime. In fact, she pays homage to them in this film.Not a real singer, but lovely to listen to and look at. I really wanted to be Ewan McGregor! And I wanted to be singing up the clouds in Paris on top of an Elephant!And watch out for Kylie Minogue's cameo as a fairy. I'm not a fan, but I noticed her. Very clever.This film plays like a Filipino movie. It has comedy, drama, action, tears, zanyness, no logic, music, fun. But this one works.I've recommended this film to not a few friends only to be retorted with &quot;Really? My friend said it sucked!&quot;A warning to the uncultured, unintelligent, unwitty, unimaginative, and unromantic: You may actully think this film sucks!My mom goes to the movies only once every few years. I think she watched Ghost, Beauty and the Beast, Titanic, and this one. But she was absolutely entertained!Can't wait for the DVD and I really hope it has a director's commentary, an isolated score, and the making.	5.0	Love It or Hate It!	2001-08-14	3	2	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ALZ5Y1CE0DWQ1	G. Guberlal	I admit, I picked up this movie because Nicole Kidman was in it. That said, I wasn't prepare for the elegance of the performances, which made her a moot point. Kidman's along with Ewan (way far from an Obi-Wan presario)chemistry lit up the screen and you can't help being drawn into the sometimes mythical atmosphere. The addition of an Elton John classic only heightened the power of Moulin Rouge. From the wardrobes to the songs, acting and choreography, the film achieved success. I didn't give it 5 stars because it was a little overdone in parts, but I recommend you pick this up and let that little glitch be: a moot point. If you're a musical fan, a closet art-film fan, or just want to curl up for some good entertainment...get it.&lt;P...	4.0	Solid and intriguing.	2002-04-10	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2JIU9KUIZ71E2	"Gina Marie Warswick ""lover of the arts"""	At times, it was too much to take in...most notably, the first 15 minutes, immediately prior to Nicole Kidman's entrance from high above the Moulin Rouge's dancefloor.  The flyby editing, the varied film speeds, and the retina-overload of color and art direction made me dizzy.Thankfully, the entire film is not that quick or excessive, but the intermittent musical numbers do tend to flirt with the same look and feel. Even the 20th Century Fox logo at the film's start is given a new visual for the film--quite cleverly done, however, sometimes this film seems a bit too self-congratulatory about how clever it is trying to be with all its sights and sounds and stolen one-liners from cheesy pop ballads from the 70s and 80s. &quot;Love is like oxygen, love is a many-spendored thing, love lift us up where we belong, love is lifting me higher, and I will always love you...&quot;  Cute, the FIRST time it's done, after that, it borders on embarrassing.What impressed me most after the sights were the sounds--I don't believe Elton John's music has received such a blatant plug since last year's Almost Famous by Cameron Crowe.  This time around, the song of choice is &quot;Your Song&quot; and everyone gets their chance to sing it by film's end.  Also, the ridiculously overplayed new version of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; is well utilized, as well as &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; and other equally shocking ecclectic selections from all imaginable genres of music.As for the dancing, however, our leads of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor aren't seen doing much, and when they are dancing, they are filmed high up to avoid the camera's glaring eye on their footwork.  I'm not quite sure how Nicole's dance injury was so heavily publicized as she didn't do a great deal.  Plenty of dancing happens, yes, and one scene involving the Police's classic &quot;Roxanne&quot; is quite emotional, but does not involve our stars.  I guess it was enough to get Nicole to do her own singing, which she handles quite nicely.Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo are standouts among the cast, but don't expect a novel story or even a non-predictable plot.  This film is purely for over-the-top production values--costuming, art direction, visual effects, editing, cinematography, sound, music, you name it...just not screenplay.  In my book, if you don't have an engaging story, really, what's the point?The story is touted SEVERAL TIMES as a &quot;story of beauty, truth, and freedom, but above all, love.&quot;  Enough already!  By the eighth time I'd heard this, I was craving some REAL dialogue!  Even the very end of the end credits makes it a point of proclaiming this ONCE MORE, just in case the viewer missed it any of the other times during the two hour film.Like director Baz Luhrman's other well known work, 1996's William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, the visuals take precedence over everything else.  That film received an Oscar nomination for its art direction, and I would be my early guess Moulin Rouge would receive nominations in that category as well as costume design.Final word:  see it to &quot;SEE&quot; it.  The gentlemen will most likely not like it; the ladies will like the &quot;prettiness&quot; of the sights.  This overload of sights will best be enjoyed on the big screen in the cinema, so don't wait for this to come to rental--see it now to be fully enveloped in the experience.	3.0	Visual visual visual visual overload	2001-06-14	4	2	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A82KZXO7AY9QP	Ginger Kowal	This movie instantly became one of my favorites of all time when I saw it in the theatre.  It really is spectacular; there's so much to look at and listen to!  The acting is superb - Ewan MacGregor's charming innocence (he's just adorable!!) next to Nicole Kidman's jaded-showgirl persona is captivating and interesting.  The music really is daring, and I think Baz did a GREAT job bringing the musical genre into the 21st century.  It's so much fun to be surprised by the way he's woven so many familiar songs into the plot of the movie.  All the songs are kept close enough to their original form to be recognizable, but they are changed enough to fit together seamlessly.The cinematography, the costumes, the sets, are just gorgeous.  The movie could be a silent slide show of images and still stand on its own.Ewan MacGregor is wonderful.  He can sing!!  And his earnest-ness is so convincing -- a testament to his acting, especially when you compare it to his portrayals of such opposite characters in Trainspotting and Velvet Goldmine.See this movie!  And catch it in the theatre while you can!  It's brilliant!	5.0	Dazzling!	2001-06-19	1	1	0

Although not the worst I've seen, I only suffered through it by fast forwarding (to see skin). It will be one of the ones I remember- to compare movies to.  Their attempt at humor isn't, and gets worse after 300 repetitions.  There are adult scenes, situations, violence, and drug use.  Bad &amp; boring.	1.0	buy pepto to watch	2002-01-03	9	3	6

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1PLF0WDLGN9D9	gmdropbuttons	This movie presents an amazing, yet classic love story. I must admit that I was hesitant to see it originally; I'm glad I did.Watching it for the first time, the first 1/2 hour doesn't make much sense and makes you want to shut it off, but after watching the entire movie everything comes together beautifully. Watch the movie a second time and you will completely understand everything that is going on. This is a movie that can be watched over and over again and will never get old. Every time you watch it you will pick up on something new.One thing that makes this movie especially interesting is its music: it has taken modern music (including Elton John, Nirvana, Madonna, and Queen) and beautifully applied it to an 1899 story.  At the same time it takes music that would have been used in the real Moulin Rouge, and integrates the two magnificently. I constantly find myself singing along with this movie whenever I watch it.The acting in this movie is superb, and the story couldn't be better. The characters all work very well together and are perfect for their parts. While this is a musical, it is one written for a more modern audience.Many people complain that the movie lacks a storyline and doesn't make sense. These people have gone into this movie wanting it to be bad, and have not given it a chance. I urge them to watch it again and realize how wonderful it is.	5.0	Amazing Mixture of Music and Story	2005-10-30	7	6	1

Every frame of film is lush and electrified, every sound edit larger then life.  A true musical, though I was not aware of this when my wife purchased it.  It shows elements of Cabaret and Rocky Horror and its very own taste of bizarre.  The plot is simple enough underneath it all as most musicals are, ala any later Elvis movie, but it proved to me to be a tough pill to swallow.  It is like watching &quot;The Wall&quot; by Pink Floyd but wanting something lighter.  It is a larger than life experience that you will love or hate, and that says something about it.  For me personally it was to convoluted and lost in its excess, but I could see that this could be someone's favorite movie that they would defend with very good reason.  It definitely is cinematic art, you just got to ask yourself what mood you are in before you watch it.	3.0	Ambitious and different	2003-06-09	0	0	0

This is definitely not my parents' idea of a musical nor anyone else's of sound mind for that matter.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AVIS2LPQYEYP4	Hamish Adam	This fission-fuelled fantasy adds a fifth dimension to the brilliantly executed story/music/picture/time quadrilateral equation of Baz Lurhmann's first film, Strictly Ballroom.This time in addition to the, sometimes distracting, craft skills of the greatest living motion picture director, you are truly suspended in the universe of disbelief that entombs Kidman and Macgregor's beautiful, doomed lives.Moulin Rouge takes you deeper and further into places where you really don't want to go.  This brutal ballet choreographs us through the sewers of 19th Century patronage into a scarlet heart of darkness where ultimate joy and pitiless pain tango through asylums of magnificent music to a tragic artistic consummation.Take a deep breath, wear loose fitting clothes, have a sweet drink to hand and make sure that there is someone close to talk to about Moulin Rouge afterwards.	5.0	Fission-Fuelled Fantasy	2001-10-19	0	0	0

Wow, just see how enthusiastic a movie can make you? It'll make you tingle with excitement and flutter with joy? That is the kind of feeling you get when you're watching Moulin Rouge, a endlessly enjoyable piece of filmmaking from Baz Luhrmann, who bought us the similar Romeo + Juliet in 1996. Luhrmann has created with his script and his immaculate direction a near-perfect slice of grand cinema. Nicole Kidman's performance is stunning, its about time she got a role like this, the actress hasn't been so good or so daring since To Die For. Ewan McGregor is also his best in ages, lighting up off-screen with his narration and sparkling when he's acting on-screen. The costumes are delicious, the makeup is eye-catching, the editing is fabulous and the cinematography is just beautiful. What's wrong? Maybe they just used too many good songs at the start, the music started to sort of fade at the end. But that is not a problem you should worry too much about, because this isn't really a tale of music, it's a story of love above all things.	5.0	Surprising, delicious and daring comedy musical.	2001-06-03	2	1	1

I didn't expect anything of it but I was blown away nevertheless! This isn't your typical film. It's absolutely wonderful and Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor sing with their own voices. The costumes were great, the dialogue was great (even though it was, at times, borrowed). It must have been hard to make entirely new songs out of lines from old ones. I loved this movie so much I bought the book and learned little secrets and got to see excellent photographs you don't see in the film. I'm going to buy it when it comes out on tape and DVD!

After having only seen the whirlwind, loud, colorful trailer that only suggested that the film is a musical and it involves a lot of dancing, a lot of red lipstick, Nicole Kidman, Ewan Mcgregor (sigh...), and some French place called the Moulin Rouge, Rebecca responded with a confused, ""Moulin Rogue? No way, she's a prostitute or something..."" After getting one of those pains in the back of my head that I always seem to get whenever Rebecca hurls a statement of just this type in my general direction, I proceeded to sift through the debris that this argument had left between me and coherent thought, and I proceeded to explain the actual reasons that I was attracted to the movie. But honestly, how and why would the fact that the leading female character in a film is a ""prostitute"" serve as a basis to write the film off entirely? I really have to let that one go, anyway, I listed several reasons: I thought Baz Luhrmann's cinematography in Romeo and Juliet was choice so I was interested in seeing his work here, I thought ""hmm, musical...sounds refreshing,"" and mainly I had been in love with Ewan McGregor's Scottish-turned American actor appeal for quite a while.After seeing the film I had sort of mixed feelings, more leaning toward disappointment in the film than in admiration of it. While McGregor's voice was more than enough to keep me entranced through the entire two hours, I was disappointed both in Satin's (Nicole Kidman) character as well as the shallowness of the storyline. When a movie's theme can be summed up in four words, in this case ""truth, beauty, freedom, and love,"" that leave little more to think about than the universal call of the '60's, the impact is less than noteworthy. The plot honestly relys on little else than a dreamer/writer who falls in love with a woman of immense beauty, but the evils of the world will not let them live for all they ave ever asked, once again, truth, beauty, freedom, and love.I was disappointed in the development of Satin's character, not so much in the way she was played, but in the choices that she makes in the film. If the love between her and the writer really was true enough to act as the binding force of the film, then she would never have chosen the ""brave"" step to walk away from him and perform in the play. I didn't feel the alternative, her illness, was enough to tear her away.Overall, the film was an outburst of style, racing through a story that shouts its meaning in your face, and leaves you with little to think about afterword. Ewan, you're beautiful, but stick to star wars."	3.0	Moulin Rogue Exhibits Nice Cinematography; Little Else	2002-04-04	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AEIIDSQ3IW7NS	Heavenly Blue Apollonian	Moulin Rouge, completely unexpectedly, became my favorite movie when I saw it for the first time a couple of years ago. I'm not a huge fan of musical theatre so it was not a reaction I would have predicted. At the time, I never wrote an on-line review because I frankly didn't think I could do my ideas about the film justice in a short review. Thankfully, I have just discovered a review that does do this historic film the justice it deserves. The one by David Bruce.What it is that I find both culturally significant and technically brilliant is that in this movie Baz Luhrmann subverts the postmodern superfice by using visual and tonal simulacra, playfulness, parody, performance and boundary/genre conflation to point not to the superficiality and relativity of all points of view but, instead, to sing a love song that strikes the viewer as eternal--almost as if the love story itself is a Platonic form or Luhrmann believes that these two souls were destined to yearn for completion in relationship with each other. Even amidst a postmodern culture industry that glorifies pleasure without context, sexploitation and equates the power to consume with the power to prevail, Christian, an Orphean hero, is able to transform Satine with his earnest-- almost naive--idealism, romanticism and humanity. Satine, for her part, is able to channel the solo pilgrim's energies away from an unwitting narcissism towards connection, relationship and mutuality (at the beginning of the movie, Christian yearns for poverty in a world where most people have no choice over the matter and sets out to write about &quot;Truth&quot;, &quot;Beauty&quot; and &quot;Love&quot; though he probably has not allowed himself to experience any of those things in the flesh before meeting Satine). Satine teaches Christian how to freely give of himself because her love for him has taught her that while she is accustomed to giving of herself to men, true dignity in love is mutual--she learns that she can and should be loved in return. In short, Christian learns to love another person and not simply his idealizations of and musings on love and Satine finally learns to love herself apart from the jewels and her commercialized sexual appeal.To tell such a love story is not postmodern. To add spiritual depth to electric visuals is certainly not postmodern. Luhrmann is subverting the shallowness of such exploitative fare as &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, which too often present the superfice (corporate consumerism) not as an underworld but, instead, as a profane paradise where persons can be free from the shackles of &quot;oppressive&quot; ideas about love and substance. This movie represents a revolt. In short, this movie makes you want to fall in love--not go out to the mall and shop for the material props of the fragmented, postmodern self.	5.0	Adding Spiritual Depth to Postmodern Artifice and Superfice	2004-07-22	4	4	0

Now I know people try to say this is a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; scenario, and they may be right.  I, for one, hated it, from the bastardization of 80's pop hits to the sickening brilliance of color to the cheesy plot and poor acting, I thought this was a decadent, self-indulgent movie whose doubtless enormous budget was ciphoned into all the wrong areas.  Both Kidman and MacGregor deserve much better.  The camera angles are annoying, and the plot is terribly unoriginal.  I can't say it enough - stay away from this movie.However, I also hated &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;.  I love Shakespere, and I also love musical theater.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AXG4MH34EVCZI	Higgins	"Any film that is as simple as the line ""The Meaning of Life is Just to Love and Be Loved in Return"" automatically gets credit.  I suspected I was going to be a terribly big sucker for this Baz Luhrmann film, and Christ was I ever.  You might remember Luhrmann's other films, the 1996 stylistic update of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and the early nineties charmer ""Strictly Ballroom,"" both of which were artistically wonderful to watch.  ""Moulin Rouge,"" however, is a whole different ballgame.  One thing that is important to understand before going to this film is that it is a musical - and it adds a bit more camp to his repertoire than any of his earlier works.  Some of the less romantically-inclined members of the audience who were sitting right behind me were not privy to this information - and thus were not the happiest campers in the theater.  None the less, even a few heartless bastards could not ruin this electric film.The film uses a myriad of different songs - some are original, but most are revamped pop songs.  What makes these songs work in the context of a movie musical is how Luhrmann arranges them, and splices them into his visually stunning backdrop.  To give you an example of what you can expect:  when we are first introduced to the Moulin Rouge (which is a nineteenth century French brothel/night club) Luhrmann mixes ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend"" with both ""Miss Marmalade"" and Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit.""  This is all happening as Nicole Kidman is swinging high above a cast of hundreds of lavishly-dressed men and women. Glitter is falling from the sky, there are more colors leaping from the screen then you can shake a stick at, and the camera seems to be doing things that no camera should be able to do.  It really is challenging just to catch your breath in moments like these, and this is just the beginning of the film.The story is simple but endearing - a writer (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with the star of the Moulin Rouge (Nicole Kidman.)  Not all is rosy in la-la land, however, because Kidman's character has been promised to the Duke who funds the Moulin Rouge. The Moulin Rouge, of course, just happens to hold the dreams of many of the characters - including both Kidman and McGregor.  A moderately predictable but tremendously enjoyable romp ensues, giving the audience the right amounts of laughter and tears to fill their dreams for at least the next week.McGregor and Kidman light up the screen with their surprisingly good voices and their undeniable chemistry.  When he would turn to her and sing, and you watched her face light up, it was as if you could actually see them falling in love.  It was this passion that breathed life into the rather clich&eacute;d storyline.The other ""undeniable"" in this picture was the truly visionary style of Baz Luhrmann.  The world that he creates in ""Moulin Rouge"" is something that I have never seen before - and it really left me awestruck.  From the costumes to the special effects shots, everything in this film fits the world Luhrmann creates for his 1890's Paris backdrop perfectly.  Dipping sometimes into the surreal, and then other times into post modern, Luhrmann finds a way to use many styles in a seamless marriage of visual and sonic genius.  Every aspect of this film dances - and it is all you can do not to dance with it.thehighchair.net"	5.0	The High Chair reviews &quot;Moulin Rouge	2002-01-03	0	0	0

What the heck did you all expect?First off, it's the closest thing to a musical that you're going to get these days.  If you don't like musicals, don't see the movie.  I keep reading over and over again how people were ""surprised"" that it was a musical, or that they were ""disappointed"".  Umm . . . how could you miss that?  It was advertised as a musical expose'.  That means that there's going to be (gasp) singing and dancing!Secondly, admittedly (as a fan of musicals in general) Nicole and Ewan's voices aren't perfect, but they're not bad.  They're more than bearable.  Is Nicole Kidman the next Patty Lapone?  NO, but she can carry a tune and her voice is sweet if not powerful.  I actually LIKED Ewan's voice, but apparently that is a taste thing because more than one person has said that he can't sing, which I disagree with.And thirdly . . . the story line.  Yes, it is melodramatic clich&eacute;.  Yes, the whole whore with a heart of gold thing has been done before, but you know what?  There is NO way that they could do this movie any other way.  The music and the visuals are SO extreme, that if you attempted to bring in a congested, complicated story, it would get lost in the visuals.  This movie is to watch with an artistic eye - the colors, the scenery, the beauty of it would outshine ANY plot-line.  Sticking with a tried and true story (the story of Orpheus, a greek hero/demi-God) was a bright idea.  People can follow it without too much effort - imagine trying to watch this movie with it's Can Can and dancing and singing and huge sets and ALSO trying to follow a plot bogged down in detail - it's sensory overload and you'd HATE the flick.  Thank you to the producers of Moulin Rouge for keeping something simple - otherwise, it would have been WAY too heavy.Honestly, I can see where this flick is not for everybody.  Yes, there are bits of it that make you roll your eyes (thus, my 4 star rating and not 5), but if you like to see beautiful things, if you like artistic movies, or if you like musicals, Moulin Rouge would be for you.  It's spectacular in its own way - I have not seen a movie as ambitious as this in a long while.Happy viewing!"	4.0	Wow . . . why is this movie getting panned so badly?	2001-12-28	0	0	0

The previews in no way suggested that this movie would be a musical.  Although visually pleasing, the bits and pieces of pop music scattered throughout the movie was somewhat disconcerting.  I just couldn't get used to it.  It might have been a bit better if I would have known whether most of the movie was meant to be joking or serious.  I swear, every time they burst into a remade pop song, I was waiting for a punch line only to be confused when there wasn't any.  I am assuming the ""Like a Virgin"" scene was a joke, and, although I now find it hilarious, the first time I saw the movie I was so confused as to whether the director was joking and trying to make the audience laugh, or if he was in earnest ...  I would have just given this movie two stars, but for one reason.

I finally have the chance to write my review of this brilliant specticle.I saw the movie 5 times in the movie theatre (a record for me!) and I wish I could watch it every day of my life! It's a beautiful film.I remember when the show opened and most of the people in America were VERY stand-offish and wary of this display of fun and its effect on the minds of our young adults. But the film show the power of the &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; and the Bohemian Movement with Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love as the mind candy for the era.Nicole Kidman plays Satine and I love every minute of it. I have always love Nic, but I have rarely gone to a film just because she was in it. I am now a very dedicated fan! She is brilliant in this movie. She displays every aspect and every genre that a film actor should hold important. She would be jipped without living the OSCARS with an award in hand. (Did anyone see her brilliant thriller, THE OTHERS??? Another amazing performance...) She is beautiful and wear each regal costume with as much style as Audrey Hepburn and Marlene Dietrich. Nicole is amazing!Ewan McGregor is not only amazing in this film, but he brings such a scattered past to this portrayal. From Transpotting to Star Wars and now to the Moulin Rouge. He has played so many colorful characters and now he brings his real acting and vocal talent to the pedistal and makes each moment unforgettable. He and Nic are the film, though the sets and costumes are brilliant!!Baz has assembled some of the most talented people in showbusiness to create this beautiful &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot; musical/film. He is one of the only directors that can switch from comedy to drama to tragedy within seconds, while the audience feels only the emotions that he want to convey. He writes a mean script and has the eye of a brilliant photographer. This film is filled with some of the most eye-catching effects and arrangements ever brought to the silver screen.BUY THIS DVD VERSION!!! WHY? The special features DVD is amazing and you could sit down and spend the most part of a day just watching the making of the film, interviews and script adaptions. It is a wonderful DVD!

The costumes, cinematography, and art direction are spectacular and unlike anything since Cabaret.Watch out for Nicole Kidman's sizzling performance as Satine. For the first half of the movie we see a person who is not ultimately rude or shallow, but a rather desperate woman who pretends she doesn't care and is just trying to live her life the way she's told. For the second half of the movie, we see an amazingly emotional, dramatic woman who is deeply in love and doesn't even know how to express herself. In Nicole's eyes we see the desperation and depression and the crying out for help. If only we could leap into our televisions and save her from pain, emotionally, physically, and mentally. In any other year, when Halle Berry's breathtaking work in Monster's Ball hadn't been nominated, Nicole would have won the Oscar.I can't begin to describe Moulin Rouge. The whole thing is a gorgeous, dazzling drama turned into an electrifying cabaret. Ultimately though, this film is honestly about truth, beauty, freedom, and love. But they left one thing out- this movie is about sadness and the overcoming of sadness. If he ever could overcome it after the tragic ending.	5.0	Best Film/DVD Of 2001!	2003-08-19	1	0	1

That's notnecessarily bad, if the look is creative, but thetrouble with ""Moulin Rouge"" is that there is nochemistry between the two leads. The emotionalcore of the story feels as theatrical andartificial as the computer-animated Paris. Itmight have worked as a musical if the dramahadn't been undermined by the thin, semi-prosinging voices of the two leads. They'reunconvincing when they most need to sell theirfeelings to the audience.The question with this romance, or any, is why?In ""Moulin Rouge,"" our writer sees the glamour queenacross the dance floor and becomes unglued, that'swhy. His infatuation is from then forward played ashigh drama. It's never believable. And the fact shetwo-times him continuously never changes him. He'sin love with the image, no matter what lies beneaththe surface.The worst blunder is her fatal disease. We see Satineearly in the story coughing up blood. It's impossibleafter that to forget that bloody mouth every timethe writer closes in on her face. What are yousupposed to feel when you're wondering if that brightred stuff is all lipstick? The closing death sceneis truly awful. A great romance would dictate a finalembrace; but the film can't show him kissing herdisease. I caught myself thinking, ""Don't do it, man!You've got your whole life ahead of you!""Another point. Where this film was supposed to befunny, I found it loud, obnoxious, and overdone. Theonly genuine amusement I got was from the introductionof modern pop lyrics into the dialogue.What's best about this film? The eye candy is trulyspectacular. But you've pretty much seen everythingyou need to see in the first half. The second halfis mostly a repetitive backdrop for a story that notonly slows down but becomes more a downer with everypassing minute. I was relieved when it ended.If you want to see this kind of thing done well,check out ""Cabaret."""	2.0	Vulgar Tripe	2002-02-05	6	1	5

Well, at the beginning of the movie it's kind of boring. At the middle is very good composed.The movie is basically of an actress (Nicole Kidman) who wants to become more famous. So, she wants to impress the Duke. In a play she meets Christian (Ewan) who she thinks he is the Duke. So she falls in love with him. But, the Duke doesn't accept that. The Duke wants her to be for him. In a performance, (actress Nicole Kidman) falls because she has a fatal disease. Only she doesn't know that is fatal until later on in the movie. The Duke is planning to kill Christian so (actress Nicole Kidman) can forget him. But, (Nicole Kidman) lies to Christina that she doesn't love him no more. She does that so Christian can forget her and leave so he won't die. At the end, (actress Nicole's) last performance Christian knows that (actress Nicole) loves him and lied about that she didn't. The Duke doesn't accept that and tries and kill Christian when the play is going, but fells. At the end of the play (Actress Nicole) dies, and Christian cries beside her.So this movie was very good composed. It made my parents cry. So I guess the LOVE in the movie was so real.

With only one theater in my town, it only lasted a week and i wasn't able to see it then. Usualy I wouldn't buy a movie before seeing it, but i went out on a limb with this one, and was amazed, astonished, blown away by this movie! It was absolutly the greatest movie i have ever seen. Its chaos, color, and music is like a feast for the senses. Ewan's voice was so innocent and naive, without losing his masculinity. Nicole, an amazing actress, was at her best in this film. You may love it, or you may hate it, but I guarantee you will not leave the theater (so to speak) without feeling a thing.	5.0	My new favorite movie of all time	2002-01-07	2	1	1

Those who didn't like it much, who hated it, or were confused by it, will find the Commentary track especially illuminating. Luhrmann and Pearce are absolutely mad! And brilliant. Listening to the track made me realize just how good the movie is. The very intentions these two guys had for the many devices they used in the film were the very ones I responded to. Which tells us one important thing that the non-Moulin Rouge lovers don't get: They knew EXACTLY what they were doing.	5.0	Why those who don't get it should buy it	2002-02-21	4	2	2

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1W62UQWNZMM55	"""infinitemovies"""	First let me say that my actual rating for this movie is three and a half stars. Now judging by the reviews posted on this site for this movie you either love MOULIN ROUGE or you don't. I would not go so far so to say I hate it but of course I don't love it. I'll skip the opera like plot since probably mostly everyone knows it. The movie is filled with tons of kinetic energy, hypnotic sets, costumes, cinematography, editing, and choreography as well as leading and supporting actors which appeal to everyone. And don't forget all that music and dancing. Baz Luhrman has directed opera before and many remember his avant guarde interpretation of ROMEO AND JULIET so one would think he's perfect for this job and he is. The operatic performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor suit this movie very well. Now the reason why I did not think this was a perfect movie: when it doesn't have any singing or dancing (and even while there is singing and dancing) it reverts to unabashed kitsch. This becomes very tiring after a while. The majority of the kitsch comes during the second hour. It is made up of over-the-top sentiment which this viewer could not seem to get used to. There will be people who will embrace it for it's kitsch and those who will not. It all depends on you. But in terms of it's artistry (the singing, sets, etc.) one can't deny it's an accomplished film.	3.0	MOULIN ROUGE: You either love it or hate it.	2002-01-04	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A319SKSB556033	"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews"""	How gloriously camp this drivel is. Remember Riverdance and Lord Of The Dance and how everyone thot it was so cool at the time? The same applies to this movie. And the story is up to very little indeed, in fact it is like Grease mixed with Luhrmann's version of R+J. A man and a woman fall in love. Wow! THAT'S never been done before! Very weak and totally unoriginal.This should have seriously just been a Broadway hit and not a big screen hit. But, of course, if every critic and every woman who sees this with all of her girlfriends likes it and if they rave about how good it is because everyone else says it is great and they only went to see it because people are telling them that it is a great movie (apparently a fact, not an opinion!) then they are only going to watch the great movie that it everyone says that it is. Me? I just watch the movie for what it is. No bias or pre-movie opinions. And what I saw was a stinker.Almost everything in this movie seems so forced and shoved in our faces. Every shot is cluttered with overly decorated sets, too many occurrences and detail to register with us in 2 seconds cuts, heinously bad dubbing that is about as unconvincing as Orson Welles masquerading as Mickey Mouse, VERY bad CGI that Luhrmann seems to be in love with and too many androgynous and weird looking characters.This film is all visual, or, if I were unoriginal (like the movie) I would say all style and no substance. Take away the indulgent and increasingly annoying sets/backdrops and all the stupid jumping around and dancing and you are left with what? A tedious movie that is good only because people say it is good. Another victim of `Insider Syndrome'.For me, every set in a movie should, at the same time, be realistic and reflect tone and mood of the scene. EVERY-SINGLE-SET in Moulin Rouge is overly-decorated to the point that we cannot tell what the set is. They are and eyesore, ugly to look at and extremely garish. A representation of everything this movie stands for: indulgence, ego, campiness and pointless extravagance.Lowest marks sorry. Oh and one last thing; how come no one speaks French in this France?The self-important features contained on this DVD only reflect the attitude of the film even further.	1.0	Seriously ugly film.	2002-11-16	12	6	6
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2HHR1G35WXO03	Irene Land	I was immediately captured from the opening curtain parting showing the old 20th Century Fox logo to the final credits and their inspirational ending with what the film was about -- especially love. Inspirational, brilliant, awe-inspiring-- I cannot find yet the right adjectives to bring this film to its highest praise. I watched it again after the first time and if I didn't have to get dinner done I'd have watched it a third time immediately. I cannot understand others being so perfunctory in their disdain about this film. To have watched only ten minutes and than given up is obscene. And it is doubly obscene to write a review about something you haven't seen in its entirety. Kidman is phenomenal as are all the others in the cast. Maybe the reviewers who disliked it so are too young to remember being a part of the bohemian life long ago. I spent my teens and 20's in the village and the Left Bank in Paris at Deux Magots and the Sorbonne drinking wine, pernoud, reading poetry and enveloping the beauty of art around me. But that can't be. I know a wonderful young lady who loved this movie. Amber is from Memphis, TN, and I'm proud of her for having the insight that all these others don't. Her heart must be at Deux Magots listening to poetry. People--see this movie again and again until you finally understand what it's all about. If you don't you will be missing one of life's wonders and you will be all the less for it. Don't cheat yourselves out of being loved in return.	5.0	The most devastatingly, inspired, brilliant movie ever made	2002-02-17	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2ORPBLS490W63	Jack	Ive read a lot of the more negative reviews, and I am dissapointed in them.  They say they walked away in the first 15 minutes. And yet they feel they have a right to review the film and give it one star.  This is not only stupid, it is also incredibly misleading.So yes, in the first 30 minutes or so, they dont jump right into the plot, it takes it's time showing you the style of the movie.  And granted, it certainly isin't for everyone. So I could understand why one would maybe give up on it.  But if you know anything about movies, the first 30 minutes dont make the film.It's something new, something fresh, and something rather insane, yet wondrful at the same time. The acting is fine, nothing great, but doesn't contract from the film at all.  The music is very grand, and very fun. The visual style of it is incredible, bold, inventive, and was my favorite aspect of the film.  The story is great I thought, very simplistic and one thats been told before, but still good nonetheless.  Its a good experience, and a good musical.  While it definetly isin't for everyone, if you just keep an open mind and go with the flow, you'll have a lot of fun with it.	5.0	Don't give up on it	2002-02-06	4	3	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	The Bohemian Paris of the beginning of the 20th century has always fascinated people. This film is an attempt to capture this Paris of Toulouse Lautrec and his friends, of Montmartre and the Moulin Rouge that is becoming the trendiest theater of the country and probably of Europe. So this musical is absolutely full of music and singing and dancing and all other type of stage art to transform everyday life into a constant whirlwind of immediate action that is supposed to swallow up feelings, sentiments, passions, and all other derangements of the mercantile mind of these artists who must only try to trap the rich with their women who become nothing but whores, prostitutes and money grabbers. This film could have been sordid and bleak. But it is luminous and brilliant because the show on the stage is entirely mixed up with the reality of a love affair between a poet and one of these courtesans that embellish the stage with desire, passion and life for the impulses of the rich male audience. Hence the poor Satine is at first divided between a rich Duke she has to seduce to get money for the theater and a young poet who is so inspired that he makes her vibrate with love, a sentiment she did not know so far. From divided she moves to torn apart and from torn apart she moves to subjugated and mesmerized. Love has become the new absinth of this relation, an alcohol that leads her beyond all possible reason. Yet she will betray it to make the show possible, and yet her love will re-enter the stage through a small window under the stage after having been expelled through the main entrance door. And the show becomes real life, the plot becomes real passion, and what's more tuberculosis catches up on Satine and makes her die in the closing scene of the play transforming a simple dramatic act into a real life event, without the audience realizing the drama. This film is thus breath-taking by its rhythm and by the merging together of reality and illusion. It becomes a dream made true by some fairy in the wings. Yet it avoids pure sentimentalism and reaches the beauty of the mind and the heart. It is greater than God's intervention in human affairs. It is no  deus ex machina  but it is the real power of real life invested in the artificial brilliance and elegance of a theatrical show. Romantic maybe, sentimentalese never. A masterpiece of Bohemian art one century after the events.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU	5.0	Real Love becomes the plot of the play	2003-12-18	4	2	2

But ""Moulin Rouge"" Was THE BEST. Ewan & Nicole made it seem like they had something going on off the set (*wink*wink*). There were some parts on MR that I admit were funking, but the story ""The Greatest Thing You'll Ever Learn, Is Just To Love, And Be Loved In Return..."" is one of the best I've seen in the typical ""Romeo & Juliet"" Love Stories.Everyone should at least see this movie, their singing is spectacular, the acting is one of the best I've seen, the chemistry is wonderful.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1IKDTKKMERUB1	Jai Normosone	The opening sequence would be best described as an attack on the senses with your brain trying to place the tunes while trying to play 'catch-up'.It is a fantastic movie that would appeal more to those who grew up listening to music from the late 70's to the early 90's - from Marc Boland &amp; T-Rex to The Police to Nirvana.  Oldies may have a problem picking the tunes, with the under-20's maybe not understanding the significance of others.Definitely a 'must-see' for the 27-37 age group.  Very much recommended for everyone else.Only problem I had with the entire movie is that while Ewen McGregor *may* have a semi-respectable voice, he always looks like he is over-singing - he is much better to listen to, than to watch.	4.0	It's a Love-it or Hate-it kind of movie....	2001-06-28	4	1	3

Nicole Kidman brilliantly lights up the screen in the oscar-winning production 'Moulin Rouge' From the very beginning with&quot;Nature Boy&quot; and through with Ewan Mcgregor's &quot;not his&quot; voice, (even though it is beautiful)the musical touch is a great adittion to the great plot. This movie also features compilations of touching love songs, like Your Song, by Elton John. I also have the soundtrack, which is great despite the overplayed &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; This is a story of lust and love, passion and romance, and a love that nothing can break. The villain, 'Count', has a awesome voice and a plays an excellent bad-guy role. The great part is how Christian (Mcgregor) persuades Satine (Kidman)to break the rules and love him like she wants too. Harold Sidler is the director of the Moulin Rouge (Jim Broadbent), and he plays a magnificent role, displayed with his Oscar Nomination. A great film for all ages, you will laugh cry, and want to have the love that Christian and Satine share in this epic film.	5.0	'Moulin Rouge' beautiful love story	2002-07-31	2	1	1

Luhrmann squandered a great cast in favor of an awesome display of pyrotechnics.  The dialog has been sliced and diced, and the deliveries are little more than sound and fury, as Kidman, McGregor, Broadbent, and Leguizamo strut from one lavish scene to another with no where to go.  God only knows what Luhrmann had in mind, but it has been a downward spiral since &quot;Strictly Ballroom,&quot; by for the most satisfying feature of his &quot;Red Curtain Trilogy.&quot;  Now Luhrman has the audacity to take on &quot;La Boheme.&quot;  Enough Baz!

Nicole Kidman did a great job as Satine and Ewen McGregor also played his part of Christian extremely well. Both of their voices were wonderful and they have a great chemistry together on-screen.The DVD of this movie is greatly put together. The extras are SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR. The deleted scenes are hysterical. You can also watch dance rehearsals, interviews with the actors, music video of Come What May, behind-the-scenes footage, and much much more fantastic stuff. Also the picture quality is 5 out of 5 stars and the same with the sound.The movie is about a lonely young man you goes to Paris in 1899. when he arrives he gets a room with a view of the Moulin Rouge. Then a ""unconcious Argentienian"" fell through his roof and the fun starts there. When Christian arrives at the Moulin rouge he falls in love with Satine. As the story goes on it gets a lot more serious. The whole end part is a tear-jerker but I don't want to say anymore. I think you should just go out and buy the DVD without even seeing the movie first because I know you will be please like I was.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AD65207N5PUSN	James Kang	Although the people above may criticize this masterpiece, do NOT be drawn in by their mindless drawling. This is an EXTREMELY exhilarating movie, full of color, humor, and tragedy. Although quite different from what one may normally see in modern movies, I can confidently say that this movie will pave the way for future musicals to come. Baz Luhrmann does an excellent job of creating a character to audience relationship, drawing us to comprehend and sympathize with everything that occurs in this movie. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman give outstanding performances and bring so much character to the roles that they play. Although quite flashy and unconventional in the beginning, the love story and that hardships that it endures makes up for it. Along with the music and the intricately weaved plot, I would definitely put this as one of my top 5 favorite movies. &quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return&quot;.	5.0	this is a MILESTONE in theatrical and musical productions	2002-03-11	6	3	3
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1DD3QJ7E3XRPO	James McKinley	Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge is one of the most beautifully shot and written musical ever.  Not one moment is wasted.  There is one such moment that is wonderful.  The scene involves a song, a magnificently choreagraphed dance sequence, and is intercut with scenes from the interlocking stories.  The love between Satine and Christian is believable and you end up cheering for their love.  Nicole Kidman plays Satine so well it ends up being one of her best performances ever.  Not to mention the fact that she looks incredible.  Ewan McGregor as Christian seems like a good way to go.  He also does a great job.  Richard Roxburgh plays the evil Duke, and will do anything for the love of Satine even murder.  The movies ending is touching and sad.

Now, I refuse to watch it again for fear of going into shock.  Worth a watch, but didnt hold up to repeated viewings.  Proves once again that covering a bad film with glitter and dancing girls does not change the essential stupidity of a bad film.  Plot as predictable as a rock, in that it goes nowhere.	2.0	Its Pretty, But...	2002-06-07	9	3	6

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1ZL6NOZBHCCR1	James P	Moulin Rouge is truly the first musical of this era. It proves that the genre can in fact be adapted to the silver-screen. One of the characteristics of this film that makes it so unique is the hilariously cartoonish way of providing comic relief. This DVD is a must-own. I especially enjoyed the special features that take you &quot;behind the red curtain&quot; to see the great lengths the film-makers had to go to to see their dreams realized.	5.0	Spectacular!

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A34CVPZ30BA4GD	James Robert Dator	'Moulin Rouge!' is perhaps one of the years best films for a number of reasons. The first is that finally someone had the guts to remake the musical for a post-millenium audience. The post-modern eclecticism of the film may be off-putting to many, but those who can see past the amazing costume, wild music and often disorientating cutting will love the film.We're in Paris at the turn of the century; the Bohemian revolution is taking the world by storm. We meet our young, heart strong protagonist Christian (Ewan McGregor) crying over his lost love. But wait! Hello now we're inside the Moulin Rouge, a nightclub where the rich and powerful mingle with the dark and beautiful. And everyone seems to be doing the 'Can-can' to Nirvana's 'Smells like teen spirit'... sound confusing? Well it is, and for good reason.The film is essentially a love story, two star crossed lovers who are forced together by inextricable circumstances. This is coupled with Christian's efforts to win the heart of the sparkling diamond Satine (Nicole Kidman) however they must overcome an obstacle in order for their love to be recognized, and that is the Duke (Richard Roxbourgh). The film is a tragedy like many musical endings but the film's director Baz Luhrman has completely subverted the genre by adding a postmodern element.Through using pop culture and mass marketing Luhrman makes a strong point about the problems with it. Thus the film is imbued with elements of Bollywood through the Hindi dance in `Spectacular, spectacular' this splicing of styles allows Luhrman to convey much more meaning than if he had directed `Moulin Rouge' as a straight modern musical.20th century Fox has truly gone to town in presenting this amazing DVD. The number of commentary tracks as well as the green fairy version of the film (much like the White rabbit presentation on the Matrix DVD) is enough to make the fans drool. However it is in the second disc where some of the most in depth features available on any DVD can be found. Interviews with cast, crew, featurettes galore, and a host of Easter eggs truly make this DVD a benchmark of what we can hope DVD's will be realized as in the future.The transfer is flawless onto the DVD format. The crystal clear picture is the best way to look at the vibrant, elaborate costumes and the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is utterly amazing and makes the viewer feel like they are part of the film.Overall `Moulin Rouge' is a sumptuous feast of vibrant color, elaborate set and opulent costume. It really has to be seen to be believed and is one of those films that if you haven't seen, needs to be seen for nothing more than pure spectacle.	4.0	Has to be seen to be believed.	2002-03-19	4	2	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A10PBFY45A1C1Y	James Stephenson	Ok, I haven't written a review in a while, but this deserves as much praise as anything. It is a must-see movie, even if you are rovinato(a rather interesting italian term meaning&quot;Psychologically abused to the point of being broken&quot;,use it on your friends) and somehow do not enjoy this masterpiece, you must see it for its sheer originality. Is it like nothing you've ever seen before, or quite possibly will again. U know the story, all I'll say is &quot;Old Setting, New Music&quot;, including the cancan remixed by Fatboy Slim. I thought Fight Club was the most original film I'd experienced, but this may top it. So go and see it, 5/5. 10/10. 100%. Perfect sixes, whatever you want to call it, its da bomb. U R THE WEAKEST LINK. GOODBYE (But Moulin Rouge is very strong ;).	5.0	Please, see this or your life is not complete	2001-06-04	2	0	2

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AV9944QBWSGVM	James Walsh	Many people have written that this is an attempt to bring the musical kicking and screaming into the 21st century. I'm not sure if Baz Lurhmann was actually trying to do that when he made it.  I think he was just trying to make an entertaining movie.  And in that respect he succeeded admirably.In many ways the style of Moulin Rouge is an amalgamation of his previous two films.  Visually it looks very like Romeo+Juliet (with choppy camera movement and off centered close ups) and it has the same snappy dance sets and offbeat humour as Strictly Ballroom.Plot wise it is very simple - boy meets girl, girl is promised to evil man, girl tries to save boy from evil man, love conquers all and then a tragic ending - but what is wrong with having a simple plot.  The first part is quite light and frothy but the overtones for what follow are present.  The second half slows the pace somewhat but descends into some quite powerful drama (maybe melodrama in some places but only just).To those who criticise this film for being unoriginal in its plot I ask what is so wrong with that?  Are we no longer allowed make love stories because other people have already made them?  Not every film needs to be completely original.  The film is a simple story well told and surely that is quite enough.The film is a visual feast, sets and costumes are lavish and colorful.  The dance sequences are beautifully put together (perhaps some could be a bit longer - the highlight for me was the Roxanne sequence).  The music is unoriginal in content (only one new song) but completely original in the way it is used (Like A Virgin is a masterpiece of usage and again Roxanne is powerfully passionate).  The singing is excellent when one considers that most of the leads are not professional singers.  The acting is generally of a high quality (especially that of McGregor) and there is genuine chemistry between the leads.  The villian is perhaps a touch too one-dimensional but blame can not be placed on the actor but rather the script which does not allow him character development.  This is probably the main problem I had with the film.  It might have been more interesting to have a complex villian.  But perhaps that would have taken from the love story.This film is definitely not everybody's cup of tea.  If you're not into musicals, or you have not enjoyed a previous Lurhmann experience, you are probably wiser to avoid it.If you are open-minded about them then give it a whirl.  It's definitely an easy way to spend 2.5 hours and you may suprise yourself in how much you enjoyed it.  I know I certainly did.	5.0	Visually stunning, simply appealing	2001-10-17	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3AGTNGBCUX7GI	James W. Mccully	I agree with the other reviewer.  I wanted to like this movie because I love musicals. The modern songs presented in an 1899 setting just didn't make sense.  Ewan McGregor, Star Wars is calling your name. He either sings loudly screaming or soft. There is not much contrast. I think if he got some singing lessons maybe he would be better.  I thought Nicole Kidman was beautiful but think maybe she should stick to nonsinging roles. Anyway, whoever conceived of this musical couldn't decide whether they wanted comedy or drama. It started off comedy with The Hills are Alive..from the Sound of Music and other comedic elements then they brought Nicole in as a French Courtesan dying of consumption. Sounds like they borrowed this from Camille(A great old movie from the past) and mixed it with Gigi( another great old movie from the past. If they had stuck with the drama of the movie from the beginnning and used new songs that would lend themselves better to the time period I think it could have been a great movie musical.  Is there any wonder that they don't make many musicals anymore? Visually this movie is beautiful.(The set is gorgeous) but for the rest, I give it one star. I wish it could have been better.	1.0	Rouge with embarrassment( Camille meets Gigi)	2002-01-13	13	4	9

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3J810CA04L443	Jamie	Could this be the dawning for a new age of the movie-musical? From the opening curtain to the closing credits, MOULIN ROUGE was pure pleasure. The critics had me entering the theatre with low expectations... cue the opening dance sequence, and my senses are overwhelmed with sheer entertainment. Director Baz Luhrmann blows you away with brilliant tour de force and a love story that it sure to capture even the coldest of hearts.Ewan McGregor (Christian) truly shines in ROUGE. With flawless acting and a surprisingly ravishing voice, he gives his best and most notable performance to date. Belting out the 1970 Elton John hit, &quot;Your Song,&quot; McGregor gives the classic a new found glory and flare after 30 years. His voice commands the not quite original score (it was originally penned for 1996's ROMEO + JULIET), &quot;Come What May,&quot; with beauty and style. McGregor is indeed a rising talent that holds much more in store.Nicole Kidman (Satine) lights up the silver screen with charisma and flavor. Debuting her vocal talents, Kidman cuts loose with dance numbers and duets; not to mention a dramatic performance nothing short of excellent. Solos such as &quot;Some Day I'll Fly Away&quot; and &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot; showcase her musical onset (There has been talk of a future album from Kidman).Ewan and Nicole have an on-screen chemistry that even Romeo and Juliet would envy. Dazzling audiences with romantic duets, you will find yourself singing &quot;Come what may...&quot; and humming the tune of &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; long after you exit the theatre. Hence, an amazing movie makes for a beautiful soundtrack.This is definitely my favorite movie of the year. The National Board of Review seems to agree, naming it Best Film of 2001. I'd bet on McGregor, Luhrmann, and the film itself taking home the hardware on Oscar night.	5.0	ROUGE Rules!	2001-12-05	14	13	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2WGVUZBMLV37U	JAN DUBOVAN	The movie has incredible performances by the actors, mainly by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, who sing quite a lot. The pace of the movie is a little bit crazier than Romeo + Juliet, but also very different, even if it is a curtain flick.the impossible lovy story concept is somewhat simplified by Nicole Kidman's turning point sickness. But it never becomes sad as something unavoidable. It's a lovestory in spite of the fact of the structure where the couple is in trouble but still get to be together in the end, is a happy ending. It's a good movie because it resonates the 20th century of love songs and not only those, but the mile stones of that century music. it unites it in the year of 1900, which i think is symbolic for the 20th century even though it takes place in the 1900, as you can see on the costumes and designs, to add color i guess.It's also a cheat thing to take the best bits of a few love songs and turn it into something unique but not original. But when it's made you see the original quality of the outline, and the result is simply put entertaining. amazing and somewhat chaotic, but as you sit through it it's settling and sad at one point but reuniting of love hope and life from a century of song,okay?	4.0	the music overwhelms the story	2001-12-06	5	0	5
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1N1B745VRHNMY	Jane	This movie is by far the best I've ever seen! Even though it's still in theaters, I paid the full $7.25 to see it 3 times. It's a brilliant film with music, dancing and best of all...love. Christian (Ewan McGregor), a poet-writer from London comes to Paris in search of a new writing job. His neighbors bring him to the Moulin Rouge to share a script (Spectacular Spectacular) with the &quot;pimp&quot; of the Moulin Rouge, Harry Zidler. Christian gets the job and soon finds him self head over heels for Satine (Nicole Kidman), the sparkling diamond. She is the star of the Moulin Rouge. This movie has an amazing array of songs including remakes of &quot;Diamonds are a girls best friend,&quot; sung by Nicole kidman and &quot;Your song,&quot; sung by Ewan McGregor. The two lovers &quot;theme song&quot; is &quot;Come what may,&quot; which is sung by both of them. This movie will get you laughing, dancing, singing, and even crying. It's a beautiful love story and I'm sure anyone will enjoy it.	5.0	In love with Ewan McGregor	2001-07-07	1	0	1

I had heard all the hype, and was expecting at least an original, interesting experience.  Alas, it was actually painful to watch.  Aside from Nicole and Ewan, who were certainly troupers, and had better singing voices than I expected, the movie was just one long, noisy piece of self-indulgence for the director.	1.0	B-b-but, he isn't wearing anything!	2002-02-19	35	21	14

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AYJNY01NFTVX3	"Janet Morris ""fuzzypinkslippers"""	This movie furthers my belief that Baz Luhrmann is on drugs.  Why?  Well, some of the scenes seem like he must've been on acid when he wrote the screenplay, and when he directed the film.  He's probably just overly imaginative.This is a wildly imaginative and intriguing story of Satine (Nicole Kidman), a dancer at the Moulin Rouge, and Christian (Ewan MacGregor), a writer.  The two fall in love, but are prevented from being together by forces that they can't control.  Nicole and Ewan have incredible acting and singing talents, which make the film enjoyable, but what is even better is that they have terrific chemistry.  Their chemistry makes the movie even more touching.Unfortunately, this exciting musical does have a lot of sad stuff in it, so it isn't a complete happy-go-lucky film.  It's incredible and I would love to watch it over and over.	4.0	Wildly imaginative	2002-04-01	2	1	1

It is full of song and dance, romance and drama, and is arguably of one the best movies of 2001.  The dance choreography was designed  beautifully and the innovation of mixing more contemporary music with a turn of the century  period piece was pure genius.The casting was great.  Kidman  (Satiine) and McGregor (Christian) are perfect for the parts.  Kidman pulls off her part nicely, while McGregor is simply outstanding.  Further, McGregor gives probably the best rendition ever of Elton John's &quot;Your Song.&quot;This movie is a standout in a year full of poor quality films.  The colors and images are spectacular to say the least.  The title Moulin Rouge is really just a pretext to develop a romantic love story full of song and dance, not to mention a little suspence.The DVD is full of extras.  The features are also fun and enjoyable.  The boxed DVD is colorful and this expierence makes buying a DVD fun.  This movie is ideally set for the big screen, but is so well made, that watching it on TV is also fun.Maybe the genre of musicals is back, or maybe not; however, no matter, because this movie is pure fun regardless.

I have actually taken a tour of Saltzburg, Austria, where &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;was filmed, and was the only person on the tour who had never even seen the movie! That's because I hate musicals! I mean, people talking, then suddenly breaking out in harmony, yeah, that happens in real life...NOT. So, I rented Moulin Rouge and brought it home. Guess what, I never even watched it, because I know hate musicals, I just wanted to know what all of the hype was about. I finally caught it on HBO because nothing else was on, and I LOVED IT! First of all, all the stars do their own singing! Know of any stars that put out albums just because they're stars and they think they can sing?(Jennifer Love Hewwitt and Joey Lawrence come to mind, but I bet you could think of more.)While Nicole Kidman, who usually really bugs me in movies surprised me with her performance, it is EWAN McGREGOR that should have got the oscar nomination! He blew me away! His voice is so strong, and he can express the emotions of hurt, and love and anger without uttering a word! He is much better casted here, than in the Star Wars saga.John Leguizamo is refreshning, and the music...THE MUSIC! Music that I could actually relate to!I had to buy this 2 disc dvd, and the extras are great. Check out the Josh Abrams remix of &quot;Come what may.&quot; The video made from outakes from the movie, and I wished that every dvd would show some outakes, they are so entertaining!

I was hesitant to see this movie, and the first 10 minutes weren't encouraging.  But I'm glad I made it through the first part, because the movie was, well-really good!The cinematography was excellent.  I loved the use of vibrant reds that surrounded the Moulin Rouge, while the rest of the town was painted in drab grays.  The soundtrack  was distracting at times, mainly because I'd try and figure out the song they were remaking.  But the way they blended love songs together in the medley's was fun and very well done.  I may have to go out and get the soundtrack.As for the actors, Nicole has outdone herself here.  Very well acted, and she sings suprisingly well.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AISKF2I1CC5BY	"J. Capuano ""Joe Capuano (Avid Writer)"""	I, for some reason, enjoyed this film more than I should of.  I mean, the film is masterfully directed.  It's one of the best of the year.  And the fact that Baz Luhrman wasn't nominated was a damn shame.  It's okay, though.  It got a Best Picture nomination.  Even though it didn't win, it still picked up Art Direction and Costume Design.The film would be too complicated to explain all together here, so I'll do my best.  A young man sets out to Paris to become a writer about love.  But he's never been in love, which proposes a problem.  But when he meets a group of playwrites/producers under humorous circumstances, he learns they are putting on a play.  About what at first, we're not exactly sure.  But they don't have funding for the play, so they head down to the infamous Moulin Rouge where they plan to put the play on and from then on out, you'll just have to figure out for yourself.As for the film itself, it's amazing.  The first twenty minutes of the film is frantic, to say the least.  At first, it appears as though they're just trying to introduce as many characters as possible in the beginning of the film, while splicing such pop culture staples together, such as songs from Nirvana and Marilyn Monroe.  And of course the popular remake of the song Lady Marmalade.  And yes, I said Nirvana.  I really don't want to tell you too much more about the film.  Discover it for yourself.The video transfer on this disc is amazing.  There is some EXTREMELY slight edge enhancement, but you'd have to be really looking for it to notice it.  Then why did I?  Well, I watched this disc four times, which I'll get into in a bit.  As I said before, the film won the Oscars of its art direction and costumes, and rightfully so.  All the colors come to life with vibrance.  It's the next best thing to actually being there.  Watch this disc on the biggest TV you can find and you'll see the light.Now, when I said that I watched the movie itself four times, once was for the movie itself, the second time was for the picture quality, the third time was to analyze the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, and the fourth time was to analyze the DTS 5.1 mix.  Much like the video transfer, the audio is basically flawless.  On the Dolby Digital, it was hard to hear some of the lyrics, but nothing incredibly distracting.  The DTS is better, as expected and there were actually some good moments where the subwoofer gets some action that wasn't during a musical number.And as for the extras, I don't know where to being.  Talent profiles, documentaries, outtakes, music videos, and just about everything else you could think of.  It'll take a while to get through all of them.  I know because it took me around six hours to watch every extra.All in all, Moulin Rouge is the best DVD of the year in every aspect and definitely worth owning.	5.0	Incredible, if you can get past the first twenty minutes.	2002-03-25	2	2	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2QMEUCZ0ICH7Y	"J. E. Brinkman ""Browncoat"""	"If you've ever been in love, then you will love this movie. It's quite simply the most romantic film to grace the silver screen in at least a decade, if not longer. It brings to mind the golden days of Hollywood when everything at the movies seemed to shine with a radiance and magnificance that most movies today seem to lack.And the soundtack is brilliant!It encompases almost every important song from the last century and puts a new spin on them all. Imagine a can-can dance medley featuring Madona's ""Material Girl"" and Marilynn Monroe's ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" that takes place in the middle of a 18th-century Parisian brothel. Or picture a duet by the film's star-crossed lovers (i.e. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, just in case you didn't already know who starred in this movie) that features such hits as Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You"" and John Lennon's ""All You Need is Love"" (along with other great selections by David Bowie, Elton John, Phil Collins, U2, Paul McCartney, and many more) that is performed on top of a building shaped like a giant elephant. And, if you're still in doubt about this film's ""unique"" spin on some old classics, then I guess the idea of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" being portrayed as a Broadway-esque song and dance number performed by two middle-aged men wouldn't even give you pause to think, right? Riiiiiiiight. (Note my sarcasm there, LOL.)As far as the plot goes, there is a boy (McGregor, who has such a compelling singing voice that, in all seriousness, I would pay good money just to listen to the man sing the ABC's song). And, upon his arrival at the infamous Parisian nightclub/brothel that the movie is named for, he meets and falls in love with a girl (Kidman, who looks simply ravishing and has a fairly good singing voice as well). But she is a courtesan (for those who don't know what that word means, let me simplify - she's a high-paid prostitute) who is promised to another (the evil Duke of Monroth, played by the wonderfully over-the-top Richard Roxburgh who is quite hiliarious - and, trust me, that's a good thing). Add to that John Leguizamo's spledid portrayal of real-life painter Toulouse-Lautrec and a fun play-within-a-play plot twist and you have a movie that's well worth the price of admission!I could keep talking about how wonderful and special this film is for many more paragraphs, but I suppose I should cut this short. So I'll end with this final thought: this is a must-see movie, I kid you not. Anyone who loves romance, anyone who loves music, and anyone who loves glamorous movies (not to mention anyone who loves actors Kidman and McGregor, or director Baz Luhrman) should see this movie. You will not be disappointed."	5.0	A magnificent movie masterpiece!	2001-09-03	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2KN45GQOMKY8P	"J. Edmonson ""letoofdune"""	"I believe this movie will truly go down as one of the few movies to draw the audiences in two seperate camps.  Either you saw this as a horribly done art piece, with cardboard cutout characters and inconcievable bad music superimposed over useless special effects, or you saw this as a musical masterpiece, a fine juxtapositions of emotion and music over a common theme: love.I fell into the latter camp, but the argument for the first remains true.  Not everyone is going to like Baz Luhrmann's camera shots, the camera ducking in and out of Paris, heading towards the Moulin Rouge.  If you didn't like this style in ""Romeo + Juliet"", then you definately aren't gunna like it here.As for the music, I enjoyed the juxtaposition of turn of the century imagery with popular music.  Although I'm sure if I hear ""Lady Marmalade"" one more time, I'll have to kill someone, most of the music truly fits the movie.  Songs such as ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Like a Virgin"" are placed seamlessly into the movie.  I truly felt like Baz Lurhmann had created a world in which I wanted to be in.As for the actors, this movie drew a strong set of talent.  Ewan McGregor's portrayal of the wide-eyed writer Christian is wonderful, showing how his youthful ideals of love transform into a more embittered view.  Nicole Kidman is at her best since ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" and Jim Broadbent is excellent, although I prefer his role in ""Iris.""All in all, rent this movie before you buy it.  It's a great movie for some, and akin to gargling glass shards for others."	5.0	Baz Luhrmann has done it again...	2002-03-10	3	2	1

I went into this movie with high expectations because of all the hype. all I can say is, the film is remarkable. The music electrifies, the heat between Nicole Kidmanan and Ewan Mcgregor is smoldering, and the sets are dazzling. all this combined makes Moulin Rouge the best film of 2001. The film won Golden Globes for Best Actress (Nicole Kidman) Best Original Score, and Best Picture (Musical or Comedy.) While there are no original songs (except for the Kidman/Mcgregor duet &quot;Come What May&quot;) the music is still intense. Especially Kidman swinging on a giant trapeze at the Moulin Rouge crooning &quot;Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend/Material Girl.&quot; You'll never look at the song &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; the same way ever again! All in all, a fantastic film that should win the Best Picture Oscar! Baz Luhrman did a fantastic job!A penniless writer named Christian (Ewan Mcgregor) is trying to get a production he writing put on at the infamous Moulin Rouge. Nightclub singer Satine (Nicole Kidman) wants to appear in a production and become a real actress. The Duke is considering putting on a show at the Moulin Rouge where Satine works. They just need a signed deed from the duke to put the show on. Satine, confusing Christian for the duke tries to seduce him. The Duke agrees to let Christian write the production, and let Satine star in it on one condition: Satine belongs to the Duke exclusively. Satine and Christian fall deep in love and are inseparable.

There are plenty of fanciful images:  the moon sings opera, green fairies appear, pixie dust swirls around Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman as they sing on a floating cloud....  Come on, how can you take this movie seriously enough to hate it so much!  And how can you then be so upset when they start singing Madonna...  like the film was super-serious until Elton John entered the picture?My advice to anyone who likes theatre or Broadway shows:  relax, sit back, and enjoy.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ATL84JW0KKIMJ	"Jeffrey R. Tilley Jr. ""goatman_1"""	I watched this movie only after several people (whose opinions I really respect) recommended it to me, already cringing and ready to tear it to pieces.  &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi and Tom Cruise's ex-wife in a musical? HA!&quot;  There was something so hokey about the trailers and the whole concept that I had already judged the movie and deemed it a piece of pretentious artsy-fartsy drivel before having ever seen it.  It just seemed ripe for parody.Not only that, but I hate musicals.  HATE THEM!  I've tried to give as many of them a try as I could stomache, but all of the ones I've seen have been terribly cheesy.  It's one of the resons I hate Disney movies.  There's something just basically stupid about them that I've never been able to get past, and to me, Moulin Rouge was going to be just another stupid musical to add to the list.Then I saw it.Ok, now I have to admit how wrong I was.  The music was excellent, the sets were amazing, the story was compelling and it was really funny.  It was that last part that won me over.  It was funny in a very unpretentious kind of way that I found endearing.  It wasn't necessarily self-parody, but the director seemed to know exactly when to add humor to break up the melodrama, and the melodrama was just enough to not seem saccharin.For some reason all the flamboyant corniness ends up being charming instead of revolting.  The flick just has heart.  I was expecting something gaudy like a half-drunk, middle-aged drag queen belting out show tunes and grinding out the rent. Instead it has a sort of childlike innocence that wins you over like a kid whose voice is mediocre but sings with passion and sincerity and never blushes.For those of you who've already seen it in the theater, the DVD is excellent.  It has lots of bonus goodies like deleted scenes, lots interviews with cast and crew (including one with Fatboy Slim who I had no idea was involved), feature-commentary, music videos and behind the scenes stuff.  The DTS sound is amazing and sounded awesome on my system.Anyway, regardless of what I think, most of you are going to either love it or hate it,  I think you should give yourself the opportunity to do one or the other.  Don't make the same mistake I almost made.  Watch it first, then judge.	5.0	The movie I wanted to hate, but couldn't.	2002-01-01	3	3	0

Umm...what didn't I get? The trailer looked dazzling- images of luscious glitz spliced with Nicole pouting seductively as the music spirals to an ecstatic explosion of decadent frenzy...(breathe)...And yet the film was a plodding, embarassing mess of shrill caterwauling and gaudy/trailer-trash (NOT gaudy/burlesque) mise-en-scene. I know it was supposed to be a post-modern/avant-garde pastiche etc etc,but I obviously watched a different film to everyone else.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1VKF0GMIU7G4A	Jennifer A Doody	"Whenever I try to describe this film, I inevitably find myself stumbling over the words.Stunning. Mesmerizing. Like nothing I've ever seen before.Genius is, by its nature, challenging. Unlike most of the so-called ""art"" being foisted on us, most of it merely a re-telling of last year's top-grossing film with the same predictable dialogue, ""Moulin Rouge"" is astonishingly daring, brazen, stunning - and unapologetic, for which I love it even more. It may possibly redefine the term ""fast-paced"", particularly when it comes to camera work and editing.As far as the performer's work goes, Ewan McGregor has made me a fan for life with his work in this film. ""Moulin Rouge"" is seen through his eyes, and he must convince the audience that he is absolutely giddy with first love for Satine. Were his lines spoken with less reverence, less enthusiasm, we wouldn't believe him. Instead, McGregor inevitably reminds us of the first time we fell in love - how the whole world looked different, how it seemed as if everything were possible. He's a powerhouse actor, and it shows in this film. On top of having a delightfully impressive singing voice, his acting never wavers; even when he's singing to Satine, his love for her just shines.Kidman is visually stunning in this film. The ice-skinned beauty is required to be adept at vaudeville slapstick one second and the embodiment of a smoldering temptress the next. Fortunately, Kidman has the acting and vocal range demanded by this work, and should be lauded for her performance. Her performance during the final segments of ""Moulin Rouge"" are riveting, overwhelming moments, and she plays them to perfection.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It is unlike anything you have ever seen. Leave your cynicism at the door. If you prefer to dress it up as ""realism"", leave it outside, too. Instead, take a chance. Allow yourself to let go and simply experience this film. It will resonate with you for weeks to come."	5.0	Genius is a tricky thing	2001-07-13	3	3	0

The effects are spectacular, the dancing phenomenal, and the music and sets are simply stunning. Hats off to Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor for their performances, which are nothing less than oscar-worthy. Baz Luhrmann has taken a genre that has been fading rapidly throughout the past several decades, and has brought the movie musical back in a way that could only be done by him.This movie redefines what a musical should be with its classic tragic love story, wonderful songs, and exotic setting. Moulin Rouge clearly shows us how love triumphs over all within the exotic arena of one of the most risque nightclubs of the world. The eccentricity of the cast as well as the high-energy pace that this movie moves at is a complement to the director and the cast, who truly developed this movie into one that will not soon be forgotten.As a musician, I applaud the hard work and talent that it takes to make a movie musical, and I have to say that this is one of the best portrayals I have seen in a long time. the glamour of the Moulin Rouge along with the music of today truly makes this a movie worth remembering.;	5.0	High-Kicking To the Stars	2002-02-07	4	3	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AGY13TEH0Z785	Jennifer Smith	"I can understand why some reviewers hated this movie.  It's loud, colorful, and trippy, with fast-paced and frenetic editing.  It's different than most of the items on, say, Blockbuster's ""Top 10 Video Rental"" list.  I don't recommend this movie to my ""normal"" friends, but I found it visually stunning, emotionally charged, and quite addictive.  I've watched it three times in the past week.Yes, the songs are obviously modern, too modern to really have existed in an actual ninteenth century theater.  But.  The director used songs that we, as a post-twentieth century audience, would connect with.  What song to better help us understand the agony of loving a prostitute than ""Roxanne"", even if it's been transformed into a sort of nightmarish tango?  How more clear can Satine express her moral views than with a ""Diamonds/Material Girl"" medley?Nicole Kidman was an absolute goddess in this movie.  I thought she and Ewan MacGregor took an extremely big risk by taking on an unconventional project like this.  They had to be over-the-top-in-your-face-balls-to-the-wall theatrical to create the carnival-like madness of Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge.  I feel that their efforts paid off nicely.If you're not a brave movie-goer, I would skip this one and get ""The Scorpion King"" or something.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1C810TLWZNIJV	Jenny	I have read some of the Moulin Rouge reviews, and they are definitely mixed. But I would encourage you to watch this movie. However, you need to watch it more than once. The first time I watched it, I wasn't sure if I liked it. Right after the movie ended, I was just sitting their with my mind spinning. It took me about a week to realize that I wanted to see it again. The second time I watched it, I fell in love with it. You will catch so many things that you missed the first time. You will also appreciate the elaborate sets and costumes. The acting in this movie was great- Baz Luhrmann really did a great casting job. Even the singing was impressive- both Nicole and Ewan. This is just a personal opinion, but Ewan's voice really left me amazed. His talent is shown especially in &quot;Your Song,&quot; a remake of an old Elton John song. After watching Moulin Rouge I became a new Ewan fan. :) I know many people didn't like the movie because of the music, but this is a way in which the movie tries to be different. With all of the similar movies coming out recently, Moulin Rouge tries to go out on a limb. The songs in the movie were chosen to give 19th century Paris a modern spin, to make the movie different than normal expectations predicted it would be. Some of the scenes are quite fast-paced and dizzying, but I liked the alternation of fast and slow sequences. It keeps you interested. Probably one of my favorite scenes in the movie is the tango scene towards the end of the movie. So many things are happening at once, and the camara switches from one to the other, but it is done in a genius way. If you turned Moulin Rouge off in the middle or watched it only once and hated it, try watching it again. Most likely you will have an entirely different perspective on the entire thing. I am very very very glad I gave it a second chance. Now I can't watch it enough, and I notice something new each time!	5.0	Give Moulin Rouge a chance!	2002-05-18	3	0	3

Lots of lavish color, movement, sights and sounds explode on the screen like a Toulouse Lautrec painting on acid. Baz has captured all the excitement and decadence of 1800s Paris, given it a modern twist and reinvented the classic movie musicals of days gone by. And the result? A truly unique cinematic experience that is still talked about.The cast worked together beautifully, and put blood into it. Rarely have I seen an ensemble throw themselves into their work as wholehearted as this one. Nicole Kidman as Satine was described by a critic as 'game' in this, and I can see why -- she does a strong job, but she's slightly miscast. Happily, the film isn't actually about Satine, any more than La Traviata is about Violeta. This is Christian's story, and Ewan McGregor is more than capable of carrying the film, because he's the heart of it. And if this film is about anything, it's about heart. Each of the supporting characters is good, particularly the Duke and Ziegler. The whole feeling is operatic, with high camp and severe pain interspersed, sometimes so closely together I got emotional whiplash. This is exactly how I was supposed to feel.The first frenetic 30 minutes will have you clutching your seat and gasping for breath. It's like a white-knuckle ride at your favorite theme park - it's almost too much to take. But what a ride! ""Moulin Rouge"" is a movie to be viewed more than once....if only to take in what you missed the first time. You'll either love or loathe it. But if you choose the latter, quickly take your pulse and check that you're still in the land of the living! Mr. Luhrman is also a genius, though he could have easily cut 1/2 hour from the end. ""Moulin Rouge"" will fill all of your senses accompanied by a great Soundtrack (s)."	4.0	Unique Cinematic Experience!	2006-01-06	6	4	2

It gives so much to the movie watcher, love, joy, sadness, everything!!!!! By aware of the &quot;stupid american movie watcher&quot;. Both times I went &quot;people&quot; who could not understand anything that was not funny were talking and, well, Amazon will not let me say what I felt for those people. Just a fare warning.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A353DUCQY2HP4O	Jeremy Robertson	Wow! This ain't no remake of &quot;Grease&quot; that's for sure! If you ask me personally, I enjoyed this film because of the wonderfully costuming and music.  The set design is unbelievable.  Yeah sure, some of the siging and dances is corny, but so what? It's made to be that way.  Man, can Nicole Kidman sing or what? Her voice is like an angel.  This musical is filling with a bit of drama and comedy mixed in.  I believe Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor really brightened the screen with their enchanting voices.  The most funniest dance numbers in this musical, I think, would be &quot;Like a Virgin.&quot; It's hilarious! The reason I was interested in this film, was because I heard Nicole Kidman was in it, and I knew she was a great actress.  And when I saw it for the first time, I feel in love it.  For it's charm and funny comic moments.  The wonderful costumes and make-up effects are superb.  Baz Luhrmann directed such a spectacular musical for anyone who enjoys musicals.  And this dvd is packed with extras! I'd highly recommend Moulin Rouge!	4.0	&quot;The Hills Are Alive With The Sound of Muuusssic!&quot;	2002-01-19	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A14NOMKJAZ4Z8M	"Jeremy Robertson ""Jeremy Roberson"""	For some reason, I decided to check out Moulin Rouge.  I don't know, maybe because it had the beautiful Nicole Kidman in it or something.  I just don't know.  But when I first viewed it, I was mesmorized! This is a musical unlike any I've seen before.  It surely captures your heart and gettting into the songs.  Of course, no one in my family understood Moulin Rouge.  I mean, what's there to understand? It's a tragedy waiting to happen.  It's about love, &quot;overcoming all obstacles.&quot; I like watching musicals is because of the singing and the actors.  It's like pure Disney magic! Usually when the actors can't express their feelings with words, they burst into song.  There are three great songs that were performed by Nicole and Ewan, &quot;What May Come,&quot; &quot;All You Need is Love,&quot; and &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away.&quot; Those songs have captured my heart and kept them in my memory.  Another reason I love this musical is because of it's comic moments in it.  It keeps you entertained at the beginning, making you wanna know what is going to happen to the characters.  And then, when we get deeper into the film, it begins to become more of a drama, beause of Satine's (Nicole Kidman) sickness.  But the one thing that I didn't understand about this movie, was the cause of Satine's sickness.  Maybe she was jelously in love, and couldn't handle it any more, and caused her to get sick.  It's a tragedy, so I guess you don't really need an explanation for it.  But one thing is certain, Moulin Rouge is a must have for you DVD collection. It's filled so packed extras and more.  The sound and picture of it all, is fabulous.  If you're one of those people that are into musicals, than &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is the one for you! It's deinatley one that you will not be disappointed in!	5.0	Who Would Have Thought I'd Be Into *Musicals*?	2002-03-11	2	0	2

Especially ""Your Song"" sung by Ewan Mcgregor, I never would have believed his voice could sound so beautiful, and he hit the tunes perfectly. The plot wasnt corrupted by the songs and dances, but actually blended in giving it a wonderful depth into the movie.The actor I was most amazed by was Ewan Mcgregor. I had seen him in Star Wars and thought him to be quite cute, but Moulin Rouge literally got me hooked on him. A definite must for fans of Ewan. :)Finally, I just like to say for a movie I couldnt bare to watch the first ten minutes of, I now beg my parents to buy it for me.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A8R43KMWIT1B9	Jessica	When I first sat down to watch this movie, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to experience. There are some parts of the movie that, at first viewing, don't work. The first part of the film, especially the first twenty minutes, are a blur of colors and people. However, the more I watched it, the more I liked it. The chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is fabulous, they're both great in their roles and they're awesome singers. All the supporting actors are great too, especially John Leguizamo, who is virtually unrecognizable in his role. The songs somehow fit in perfectly with the rest of the film and you'll be singing them long after the movie's over.I'm not normally a fan of musicals, but this movie is so addictive, it has become my favorite movie of all time. If there's any justice in the world, this movie will win for best actor/actress, best director, and best picture at the Oscars. My only regret is that I didn't see it in the theater.	5.0	You'll love it, or you'll hate it	2002-01-09	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AIHBEYV0JOPW2	Jessica	Well....Moulin Rouge is by far the best movie I have seen in ages. It is filled with action, humor, music, and most of all romance. The first time I saw it I was a little bit confused about what was happening, but the second time blew me away. Nicole Kidman's singing, dancing, acting, and overall preformance was outstanding. Her part really showed all of her talents. All of the preformers played their parts in an outstaning way also. I think the story, the choice of characters, and vocals really completed the film. The day after I saw the movie, I bought the soundtrack, and it had been in my cd player since. The people who did NOT enjoy the movie obviously have no true taste in what is good and what isn't. Well if you haven't seen it yet, I encourage you to, because you are missing out on a masterpiece!	5.0	Best Movie Of All Time!!!!	2002-01-01	5	3	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A222OLA2TGW1HW	"J. F Malysiak ""macafferty"""	Simply the best DVD package you're likely ever to come across! The film itself looks and sounds stunning - surely one of the greats of 2001. I saw the film twice in the theater but have to say I think I enjoyed it all the more in its DVD edition. The smaller screen affords a more intimate view of this film that for all its colorful mania is, at heart, a very touching and beautifully rendered love story. Nicole Kidman is terrific as Satine, femme fatale extraordinaire. But it is Ewan Macgregor's performance that really should be singled out for multiple accolades. He is truly extraordinary.Something about the sparkle in his eye throughout lets the audience know that he is having the time of his life. I was completely swept away.As far as the added features: the multi-cam option allowing the viewer to change and, in effect, &quot;re-edit&quot; the dance sequences is a helluva lot of fun.  &quot;Roxanne&quot;, perhaps the film's most spectacular tour de force comes alive again and again no matter which angle you choose.My highest recommendation.	5.0	Spectacular spectacular	2002-01-02	0	0	0

Not only was it visually stunning but the music was wonderful. Ewan McGregor has a wonderful voice and I really thought he was great in this movie, I really felt his pain due to his incredible acting. I was surprised by Nicole Kidman, she usually annoys me, but she was great. She also has a great voice and looked beautiful in every scene. I loved the mix of diamonds are a girls best friend and material girl. The cast also has amazing chemistry with each other. Moulin Rouge is exciting, I spent the whole movie wide eyed and on the edge of my seat. I usually do not like love stories but this just blew my mind.

I must admit, when my husband suggested we see Moulin Rouge, I adamantly protested.  I normally like suspense, thriller or horror movies.  I did not want to see a musical/romance!  Well, I went, dragging my feet, and it was one of the best choices I've ever made!  The movie was/is fantastic!  It is not your average musical.  It is fast-paced, stunning, beautiful and sad, all at once.  There is so much for the eye to take in.  I have seen it 4 times, and I'm sure there are still things that I missed.  You may call me obsessed, but it is truly the best movie I have ever seen.  Baz Luhrmann is a genius!  He could not have chosen better actors for his masterpiece.  Do not see the movie with any expectations, except to be awestruck, because it will not be what you expected! As I said, I've seen it 4 times, and at the end of each time I sat  stunned, unable to move, filled with joy, sadness, awe and admiration, all at once.  I definitely give it 5+ stars!	5.0	Movie of the Year	2001-11-08	3	2	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2T3BZ7OPQ8864	J. G. Whitemyer	I bought this DVD at the urging of a trusted reviewer.  While I was entranced by the imaginative cuts and effects during the beginning credits, my companion and I were immediately turned off by the extreme over-acting.  Yes, I've been cautioned that this technique was used to satisfy the intended theatrical effect.  However, in my opinion, the desired effect was dreadful, distracting, and irritating.  Only the first 10 minutes of my DVD was ever touched by a laser.  Unless you're a masochist, save your money.	1.0	What were they thinking?	2008-09-05	6	1	5

I have worked in and studied musical theater for years and do not typically enjoy movie musicals, because you can never connect to a tv as you can to seeing something live.  During the first few minutes I was a bit overwhelemed by the camera shots but soon was able to get into the story.  I recomend seeing this movie twice, the 1st time you have to get use to the visual experience but when you watch it again you can fall in love with the story.  This movie is very different and refreshing.  The plot is simple but it is visually and emotionally stimulating.  Even my husband loved it and his idea of a great movie classic is James Bond or Adam Sandler.	5.0	Give it a chance and you will love it	2002-01-10	4	3	1

Moulin Rouge beats Chicago hands down in every aspects of movie making - the visual and musical effects are stunning. It is the pioneer work of Moulin Rouge that reinvented musical genre and reawakened people's interests toward the musical genre. Academy has no way to payback for what Moulin Rouge did for the industry.Baz Luhrmann deserves a best director as well. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor shin brightly in the movie. What a wonderful treat! If you missed it in the theatre, go buy this DVD immediately. The sound track is a worthy buy as well, great original songs plus interesting variations of many familiar tunes. This movie as whole package (acting, music, cinematography) is exactly what a musical should be. It's a milestone and benchmark, it will trigger (has already triggered) a lot of spin-offs like Chicago trying to catch up with it.	5.0	It should have won that year's Oscar	2004-05-13	4	1	3

Movies where characters just burst into song at any time just bugs me. So I didn't seem like the type who'd like Moulin Rouge, so I left it alone. The music video supported my theory (You know, the one where Christina Aguilera looks like the Frankenstein monster). But every one gave it such rave reviews, and I had a Hollywood Video Gift Card, so I rented it on DVD. I have to say I was very pleasently surprised. The movie used songs that Had already been done before, so you already knew the words. The characters sang at the right times, and there was enough humor in it to keep me in stitches for most of it. It had a brilliant, tragic finale and amzing characters, and the actors sang very well (Nicole Kidman should Take Christina Aguilaera's job.) Do yourself a favor and rent this, and if you've already seen it the features will keep you entertained for an afternoon.	4.0	Great, imaginative entertainment!	2002-01-07	0	0	0

I loved this movie because it was DIFFERENT. Studios have been making remakes and sequels and it's just getting boring. Even though this movie was a remake, it had a different feeling to it. It is my favorite musical, next to The Sound Of Music.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman should seriously get into singing. They brought out the most beautiful singing voices you could ever imagine. I own the CD and I love the songs that they compiled onto it, even though they forgot a lot of songs from the movie.  They need to come out with a 2nd Volume of the soundtrack.  I am hoping that the DVD will not only have the music video of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, but a commentary by Baz.	5.0	The Greatest Musical I Have Ever Seen!!!	2001-07-20	0	0	0

Few movies can make you laugh and cry, or if you don't cry, at least feel for the characters.The first time you see this movie will be the best, but I guarantee you, this is one to watch again and again!Okay, now the special fatures.

And the frantic, loud, mostly flat music assaulted my ears as badly as the camera did my eyes. After 49 minutes (yes, I counted nearly every one of them) of hoping the movie would get better or at very least settle down, I finally turned it off with a huge sigh of disgust and said, ""Welllll, it only cost a dollar."" Wasn't even worth that.Just so you all know... I'm not a staid, fuddywuddy, as I generally like artsy-fartsy and art nouveau movies, but this wasn't artsy, or even arty... only frantic and noisy. I was in total disbelief that it was even considered for the Oscars, let alone nominated.I give this nose-wrinkling, eye-narrowing, frown-making, sour lemon of a movie a strong, hearty two thumbs DOWN!!...Of course... this is only MY opinion, haha."	1.0	Terrible, awful, horrendous, noisy and just plain BAD!	2002-08-11	17	10	7

While I have to admit, Moulin Rouge is NOT a movie everyone would enjoy, I was totally blown away.  The costumes, the camerawork, the sets, the musical numbers.  I think this is the most original movie to hit the theaters in 25 years.  Ewan McGregor is stunning as the writer, Nicole Kidman has never been better, all the supporting cast is top-notch.

""25johnny25"""	I expected a haunting drama glowing with crimson lips and lit by dim light bulb filaments, set in Paris on a damp night circa 1890.Instead, I was blasted by a melodramatic comedy that made no sense and was just all in all stupid.  Buskers on speed bounce around in a cartoonish manner making jokes.  A fat guy dressed like a ring leader rolls around singing Madonna's &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;.  In one dance scene a dwarf woman does the Charleston to an awful remix of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;.This movie lacked so much and yet there was enough good material in there to make a decent picture.  The backbone romance worked well and some of the dance numbers could be slowed and set to period music.  Maybe I'll buy it on DVD and edit together my own version.  To remake Moulin Rouge would be my big project if I ever become a millionaire or decide to go to film school.	2.0	Could have been low key and beautiful... It's sad, really.	2002-10-24	5	3	2

From the first surreal, frenzied, overpowering production number to the last breath of the heroine, it was a mish-mash of nothing more than whirling colors, music that drowned out the vocals, and pathetic acting.

Luckily I sat through the first 20 minutes AND made it to the real film which calms down a bit and takes on a decidedly better tone as the plot develops.This is fantastic cinematography, creative &quot;lyrical recycling&quot; from many pop anthems of the last 30 years, and an inspiring love story to boot.I was put off initially by the down-the-rabbit-hole approach of the beginning where I found the non-stop movement to be annoying, but after that I ended up really getting into this movie.

I couldn't be more pleased that it won for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design at the Oscars last night; they were certainly deserved. This is one of the most beautiful films, just aesthetically speaking, that I've ever seen.

It's a wild, thought-provoking, kalidoscopic tour de force that leaves you utterly exhausted and completely satisfied by the end.  You get the double whammy of a great story (with great music and choreography) and a mavel of technology in the how'd-they-do-that vein... without being overwhelmed with cheesy special effects.  I think you'll find this film to be highly polarizing.  You'll either love it (i.e., &quot;get it&quot;) or not.

This movie might work for a person who has been dulled by viewing MTV 12 hours a day 7 days a week.  However, anyone who enjoys great theater has no choice but to squirm though this so-called ""musical"" (isn't a musical composed of original songs?).  The music is dreadful.  The arrangements are terrible.  Originality... I think not.  Instead we are bombarded with the most irritating sequence of recycled garbage that has ever been on the big screen.  I believe the ""Like a Virgin"" sequence was my breaking point, though it's hard to isolate the straw.  Thank God I was with someone who forced me to watch the rest, because had I not stayed I wouldn't have known with absolute certainly that this was one of the worst 10 movies that I had ever seen.  When I saw Romeo and Juliet a few years ago, I remember how dreadful and insulting it was to sit through.  I am not impressed with cinematography for cinematography's sake.  How any producer could think that Luhrmann's technique (one similar to the one he used in Romeo and Juliet) was worthy of another dreadful opus is anybody's guess.

Very few reviews are in between. Why?I guess it appeals to sentiment, to gut feeling and instinct rather than thought and reason. Anyway, what is love? ""Love is fire that burns without being seen"". How to capture that evanescent, unreasonable character of love in a film?It can't be done with a nicely woven plot and well behaved script. A whole lot of ""love"" movies are just that, so they strike everything except love. They just fake it, like Satine with her clients.Well, this one doesn't fake it.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AIWRBCDSPCDRE	"John Adams ""Farley Flavors"""	In the beginning, I was enthused that director Baz Luhrmann was going to make a movie musical, considering the cinematic flair and emotional intensity, and surprising humor of his previous outings. &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; A story where much of the character's emotions were told through dance. Then there was &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet&quot; A retelling of the quintessential love story, seamlessly set in our time. Both of these films were dazzling achievements in artistic cinema. And a musical would've been a thrilling next step for Luhrmann. But this overwhelming feeling of trepidation hit me when I realized what would be in the film.One fact about me is that I'm a fanatic of musicals, If you look at my previous reviews you will see that. Fact of the matter a real musical has original tunes. When I heard that &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; would use a compilation a modern day pop tunes and that the compilation would include the putrid, festering presence of Music industry courtesans Christina Aguilera, Mya, Pink, and Li'l Kim (Learn to spell, Kim). Plus the fact that I had never forgiven Ewan McGregor, for the atrocities that were &quot;Star Wars: Episode One&quot;, and &quot;Eye of the Beholder,&quot; not even &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; could save my opinion of him. But the time came when I noticed the mixed reception that audiences and some critics had given it. Realizing I could not go by those opinions (usually I side with the critics). I inevitably had to rely on my own. I went to go see it, finally. And thank god I did. what a fool I was to doubt Mr. Luhrmann's artistic vision.The opening of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a bit of a tease. It starts out to be serene and docile as the camera zooms through a scratchy, black and white street of turn-of-the-century Paris and up into the Window of a dishevled Christian (Ewan MacGregor, who redeemed himself with this one, with his most energetic, and touching performances). But then the story begins with Christian arriving in Paris and almost immediately falling in with the Bohemian revolution with a dwarf Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo showing in his performance, that big things come in small packages.) and the sordid world of the Moulin Rouge. Upon arrival to the Moulin Rouge, in the film we're pratcially invited to this wild, surreal party where the clientele appropriately sing &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; whilst the &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; tempt them in with &quot;Lady Marmalade.&quot;(Mercifully Luhrmann didn't include the actual appearances of the aforementioned music industry trolips.) Suddenly in enters Jim Broadbent and his flambuoyant brillance as Rouge Owner Harold Zidler (Who is at his best in this film with the hilarious revamped rendition of Madonna's classic &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;). Soon the party enters into a CanCan dance filmed and edited with a striking vibrancy, and intesity that in which could only be done in a Bazmark production. It begins to go faster and faster until down from above comes Satine, the Sparkling Diamond (Nicole Kidman basking in her natural glamour and surprisingly powerful singing voice). Swinging high above on a trapeze.This entire opening sequence completely assaulted my senses and soon upon it's completion I was putty in this movie's paws. But soon the movie progresses to a more serious tone. Satine becomes contractually bound to The Duke, played by M:I 2's Richard Roxburgh. At first you think The Duke is just a clueless schmuck, but soon becomes intimidating upon his realization of Christian and Satine's romance. Roxburgh effortlessly achieves that transition in the character.Baz Luhrmann's directing manages to deliver the bohemian messages of beauty, freedon, truth, and love, and succeeds in irking the audiences emotions. Especially the tragic finale (which is wisely revealed in the beginning of the film to avoid the shock, and to brace the audience for the inevitable.) Luhrmann also manges to unveil new hidden talents in all of his leads that were never shown in their previous films. I haven't seen a director do that since Sam Raimi made Keanu Reeves actually ACT in &quot;The Gift.&quot; Though I will say that the lack of originality in the songs and the plot almost brought it down but fortunately the songs fit perfectly with the incredible orchestration and though the storyline is unoriginal it is played extremely well. But I still felt that when it came to recent movie musicals &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; succeeded with far less effort.Nevertheless this is still one of the most entertaining films of the year and one of the few great movies to come out of the WORST summer in cinema history.	5.0	Freedom, Beauty, Truth, Love, and Above All Things Quality	2002-01-12	2	2	0

I did not understand why everyone was trying so hard to please the Duke.  It seemed odd to me that the owner of such a sucessful club would all but give it away just to get someone to invest in a show.  Then I watched the out takes.  Cut from the movie is about 15 or 20 seconds that sets up the story and explains everything that is to follow.  That 20 seconds could not have been that important to the running time. It is vital that you see this or the movie won't make sense.My second problem is with Mr McGregger.  He is a fine actor, but the man is not a singer. He can however yell very loudly off key.  Why was a roll with so much music, given to someone who can not  sing ?  I also wondered why his voice was so much louder than EVERYTHING else going on around him.  If having him play that part was so vital they could have dubbed the singing, or at the very least lowered his volume.I liked the movie, once I understood what was going on.  I suggest that you watch the out takes at the end first.  Then watch the movie, you'll understand it better. Oh yeah, keep hold of the volume control to turn it down a little when Mr. McGregger sings.	3.0	You have to watch it twice.	2002-03-16	3	1	2

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1PG7HV3BNISTT	"Johnny Williams ""Johnny10"""	"This film has nothing but hype and kitch. However I realize that's what the ""average person"" likes today, and why? Because it's easy. Hey, give me close to a hundred million dollars and a string of hit tunes, some popular stars and I am sure I could turn out a so called hit too. Let's face it, this film couldn't even deicide what it wanted to be, i.e. a pitifully stupid slapstick comedy, or a pitifully poorly written melodrama, with a ""quasi-Mimi"" would be bohemian heroine, who tries to make prositution into some kind of virtuous existance.Hello mores for teenage girls! ""The show must go on, even if you have to sleep with an old ugly producer, and scarifice your true love to do it. But hey you'll die a star"". And boys, watch out for those whores! They are pretty, but don't fall in love with one. They will only break your hearts and then they die on you, leaving you to go insane.The music, what can one say about the music. A total lack of originality. That is why I was quite surprised, because everyone was telling me this is so original; ""Robert, you who loves musicals have got to go see this"". I should have followed my insticts and not seen this, because these same people told me I would love the NYC production of ""Phantom of the Opera"", three of the most painful hours of my life. Unfortunatlly, I was invited and could not leave during the intermission. However, There was one respite of hope in this trully tragic film. That was the number ""Roxanne"" it was trully well done. Too bad the director didn't opt to do just a video of that.As for the so called original cinematography, did anyone in America, other than I, see the French film ""Delicatessin""? Yes even the cinematography was plagerize in this film. What the heck everthing else was. At least the director's consistant.Let's now sum up the so called very original ""Moulin Rouge"" The songs were all hits long before the movie saw the light of day: The script was a cross of La Boheme meets 42nd Street, and the Cinematography, was straight out of mordern French trends for the cinema. The title was stolen from the night club. The comedy was poor Grocho Marx. The only thing original about this film is, that such a bad film won a Golden Globe. Usually, the foreign press exercises a little more discretion in it choices. It trully reminds me of the novel 1984 ""Good is Bad and Bad is Good"". Of course, there was a dumbing down of that society too. So it all fits.If you want to see a truly creative, innovative, thoughout musical that has been recently produce pick up ""Chicago"" A brillant satire on the American ""inJustice"" System. And maybe one day some director will have the hustpa to produce ""Sweeny Todd"". Believe me if I had the money I would, and it would be a whole ot better than this thing.!!!The only thing that this film honors is that our society is definitly  being dumb down, and most producers are capitalizing on that."	1.0	Neither Orignal, nor Ground Breaking, an Hour and 1/2 Wait to See Roxanne	2005-06-28	23	6	17

People who like musical theatre have both hated it and loved it. People who don't like musical theatre have both hated it and loved it. It just depends on how the film grabs you. If you don't like the first 10-20 minutes--wait--because the film's tone changes. It's like ROMEO AND JULIET. The first part is a crazy, comical spectacle. The second half is a gut wrenching, beautifully filmed drama. The film is thrilling and majestic. The DVD is FULL of incredible extras. If you listen and watch how Baz and his creative team made the choices that became this film, you really understand how well thought out this film is. I love the film even more knowing that there is indeed an intelligent method to the madness. And hey, the film hold the National Board of Review Award, Golden Globes, and 8 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. Seems the Love it audience is bigger than the (vicious) Hate it audience.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1P2NBM3P3TS2X	"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason"""	"...I was VERY reluctant to see this, and did so on DVD only after weeks of prodding by a well-meaning friend. I'm about as jaded a movie fan as there is, so you can imagine how low my expectations were...WOW! It must have taken a brave soul to bring this film to fruition. Director/writer Baz Luhrmann has crafted a very unique looking (and sounding) piece of work. The contemporary songs set in century-ago Paris can be rather off-putting at first, but soon you can't help but be [brought] into the romance, the glamour, the lavish production design, the frenetic energy, and the unfolding love triangle. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor aren't professional-caliber singers by any stretch, but they still perform remarkably well. Australian actor Richard Roxburgh plays The Duke, the spoiler in the would-be pairing of the young lovers, and he is an absolute hoot -- simultaneously creepy, evil, conniving, and funny.One of the songs repeated throughout the film is ""Nature Boy"", a jazz standard and perhaps the least-recognizable song to contemporary audiences. It is from the lyrics to this song that the main theme of the movie is taken -- ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return."" Sounds a bit corny, right? Yes, it does. But as McGregor rightly points out in the DVD supplementary material, music touches us on a different level than the spoken word. Words and poetry that sound silly or cheesy when spoken can be beautiful, poignant, and emotionally powerful when delivered in song. That concept is demonstrated masterfully in ""Moulin Rouge"". Even if you don't like the idea of contemporary tunes in a period musical, you will still probably be enchanted by the orchestral score weaved between them.So many things could have gone wrong with this movie to make it simply unwatchable. The cast would have to be totally committed to the idea of it all to sell it onscreen. They are, and they do. Luhrmann has created, with a singularly unique vision, what may well be the last great movie musical. The movie musical is a near-dead genre, and it takes a remarkable one to breathe respectability and life back into it. ""MR"" succeeds at that (as much as I hate to admit it - I really didn't want to like this film, but I do).""Moulin Rouge"" certainly has a few moments in it that you will find a bit too silly. But they are compensated for by other moments of absolute brilliance, beauty, and breathtaking imagination and creativity.Thanks ... for insisting that I watch this movie against my better judgement. I owe you one."	4.0	Occasionally Brilliant filmmaking!	2002-05-17	0	0	0

I agree with a lot of reviewers here that this movie has very little plot and the musical numbers???? They are all 70's or 80's songs that really have no place in Paris 1900! I watched this movie with my wife and another couple and they wanted to turn it off halfway thorough, but I said it HAS to get better let's keep watching it. WORST!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How anybody can think this is a good movie is beyond me. The first 20 minutes the camera is moving so fast and is always at some kind of angle (like the old Batman TV series) that as soon as you turn your head the camera moves again. Halfway through the film all of us where laughing at how stupid this movie is. HOW and WHY this movie was ever made will always be a mystery. The acting is horrible! Nicole Kidman can't act and now can't sing( if she ever could)! Ewan McGregor kept looking like he didn't want to be there! John Leguizamo as the Dwarf was unbearable!

Cotner	i didn't know what to expect when my wife rented this dvd (gigi meets the original ferrer moulin rouge?), and then when i started watching it, i didn't know what to think, except that it enthralled and overwhelmed me, and in the end, I liked it.this movie moves fast and is all over the place, in throbbing music and shifting camera angles, and is the plushest splash of color since warren beatty's dick tracy.  it is unlike any movie musical you have ever seen unless you have seen ballroom.for a while, when the music and constantly switching camera shots were bombarding my senses, especially the production numbers such as can-can, i thought i would start having seizures, what with the bright lights and throbbing subwoofer behind my tv.  it was like studio 54 comes to montmarte.the plot is a thin cliche -- the poor, virtuous artist vying with the evil rich man for the hand of the unobtainable, beautiful (albeit tubercular) love goddess, with moral support from his bohemian band of merry men --  but it works, perhaps because the plot is cushioned and cosseted by so much else that is going on.the cast -- ewan macgregor (equal parts john travolta, rex smith and kevin kline), nicole kidman (she can really sing -- who knew?), john leguizamo (scene stealer and talent extraordinaire) and jim broadbent (engaging, not-quite old fogie, a la his roles in topsy turvy and bridget jones,  altough seedier here), as well as the guy who plays the bad guy (i kept seeing dana carvey), are all great and eat up their roles, almost tongue in cheek.the splendid seraglio-like set (with the metaphorical mill blades, turning, turning) and use of computer graphics to show aerial shots of paris (it's a long way from sacre coeur to la tour d'eiffel...) at the tawdry end of la belle epoque,  continually stun and amaze throughout the movie -- and where, says this rube, do you get some of that-there green absinthe?this movie reminded me at times of cabaret, pirates of penzance and saturday night fever, with a little of a knight's tale thrown in for good anachronistic measure.  it has elements of all and is worth the experience of seeing how a daring, imaginative visionary director can push the boundaries of what we think constitutes a movie musical after 75 years of making them.  go see it or rent it or buy it.  the two dvd combo gives you a lot of extras, visual and musical and informative.i definitely recommend that you rent or buy this dvd; i plan to.	5.0	whoa -- gimme a valium!!!	2002-02-03	1	1	0

I've heard it said that this movie offers a very thin plot. I will say that the music and emotions (and the love) of the characters is often more prominent than anything else...but what is more important in a movie...heart, feeling, and emotion, with a great story backing it up (Camille), or an exciting plot?The story is actually based on one of the most tender love stories ever told, which must explain the timeless quality of it.  If you remember Greta Garbo in her most famous film, &quot;Camille&quot;, then you will openly embrace Nicole Kidman in this film. For she is timelessly beautiful, gives a bravura performance, and manages to re-define what it means to have glamour. She is glamorous in a new way, as Greta Garbo was in her day.There is but one worthy oscar winner this year...it is not Julianne Moore, whose role in Hannibal was completely without emotion. It is not the star of Bridget Jones Diary...obviously.. It is the star who gave a full dramatic performance that harkened to the golden days of glamour and beauty...Nicole Kidman!The music in Moulin Rouge is very affecting and brings us closer to the hearts of the stars that grace the film. I've heard some say the film is too sentimental and melodramatic.. That is not true, for a film that is not at all sentimental is not a film I want to see!

I picked up a copy and watched it with a friend.  While I am a fan of some obscure Euro flicks that most of my friends cannot understand or enjoy, I just could not get into this movie...The ""kaleidoscope"" of people and colours is well enough, the general storyline isn't bad, and the main actors are people I like and make a point of watch filmes they're in.  However, all the music being essentially plagiarized from various pop songs, and characters flipping, running, and jumping about like it is some Kung-Fu movie set in a circus, ruined the show for me, and even the tease-eroticism that can be the spice to make a movie worth the money to guys like me is overshadowed by the general mayhem that make this flick as irritating as a bad radio commercial.  Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it does seem to me that the only people this movie was mad for are the type that still haven't matured from lots of flash and snippits from some overplayed pop icons.  Maybe it's fun for some, so try it and form your own opinion.

Visually the film is very stimulating, and the songs and story are fun, often paradying concepts and pop songs, while always managing to be uplifting and entertaining.  This movie has the most momentum of almost any film that I have ever seen, and I have to say that the editing did give me a head ache before the end of the film, but was still entertained enough to finish the film.  I remember when they said that this would signal the new wave of musicals that had been dead before this came out, and I have to say that thankfully they went a more traditional route as once was enough.  I know a lot of people that absolutely love this film, and I have to say that it was fun, but I can't imagine any more helpings of this droning on any longer.

This is a sensational, one-of-a-kind period piece that actually requires attention, some appreciation of pop culture, and a willingness on the audience's part to go along for what is admittedly, a wild heck-of-a-ride.  Anyone who doesn't like it would be well advised to stay away from anything remotely related to Bob Fosse, not to mention incoherent-but-brilliant classics like Apocalypse Now, anything Python, or 2001: A SPace Odessey.  Landmark films rarely generate unanimous praise AND audience acceptance - instead, divide the audience into camps, conquering its proponents and infuriating its detractors.  If nothing else, it makes great dinner conversation and can be contemplated on so many levels, no two perceptions will ever be alike.Come to think of it, eating needles doesn't seem like a bad idea...I wonder whether Baz thought of it?	5.0	Love It or Hate It, This is a Visual Masterpiece	2002-01-29	1	1	0

I sat down, when I was sleepy, to watch it, not expecting to finish it before I fell asleep, but I never even yawned. Moulin Rouge was one of the most spectacular (&quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot;...lol) movies I've ever seen. I had to get use to the quick changing of scenes and such, because it's a fast paced movie, but that's what made it good. The music was awesome, and in a way, I feel the soundtrack cheated us out on some of the songs. The soundtrack is still pretty awesome anyway. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor and all of the other cast could sing, dance, and wonderfully entertain. Nicole Kidman surprised me majorly. She's wonderful. This and The Others has made her one of my favorite actresses. Words can't describe her performance here. It was unbelievable. Ewan McGregor was also very good. I haven't seen many movies with him in it, but this showed he has very extraordinary talent. John Leguizamo, as always, was hilarious. And to be honest with you, I'd never cried and laughed so much at a movie. When a character would feel anger, I would feel it. The actors did a superb job. Baz Luhrman is pure genius!The DVD, like it says on the box, is a groundbreaking and breathtaking experience. The menus are great and go right along with theme of the movie, and are navigated by The Green Fairy.  On the first disc, the commentary with Baz Luhrman is there, and a neat special viewing of the movie called Behind the Red Curtian. During the movie, The Green Fairy pops up and we are treated to different entertaining featurettes. The second disc is full of extra features. There are extended dance scenes with the multi-angle viewing option. I found this very interesting and fun. The Cutting Room includes director and producer interviews, deleted or extended scenes, and a &quot;mockery&quot; by Baz Luhrman. all very fun. There's an extensive look at the Marketing of the movie that's very worth the look. There are also sections on the choreography and the music.The Moulin Rouge 2 disc DVD has got to be the #1 DVD ever produced as of now, and the movie will always live on with me.	5.0	Pure Genuis.

The film is lavish and fast-moving, almost frenetic at first, demanding a looseness of the audience.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AETU6WZAUMX53	"J. Perez ""Wrestle Dude"""	The editing is fast-paced and that's not a good thing. Maybe in a music video,it would work but not here. The writing is terrible at best. 99.9% of the story makes little-to-no sense. Even WCW during it's dying years made more sense then this film. Half of the cast is either dumb or unlikable. It uses copyrighted songs and tries to make them thier own with little success. 99.9% of the acting is very over-the-top to the 5th power. The goodsides are that the settings are stylish,songs are pretty good and the dance numbers are fun to watch. I give this film a 3 out of 10.	2.0	Moulin Rouge Review	2011-11-29	4	1	3

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3PR0NLLIB3QIB	JP	I can see why people love this movie with its stunning visuals and usage of many famous songs. Its basically a musical made by taking the most famous songs of the past 50 years and linking them with a story. Or did they make the story first and then think of songs?And I can see why people hate this movie too. The pace is so frentic, and the camera angle constantly shifting... It reminded me of the Doors film of a few years back! It made me dizzy at time.This film is a decent modern musical made for the MTV generation. Is this a good idea? Well, you will probably either like it or hate it.	3.0	like it or hate it	2002-01-18	1	1	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1LVZOK9F7K4CN	JR Pinto	"Moulin Rouge is probably my favorite film of last year.  Having seen it a whole bunch of times now, some of its excesses do seem a bit silly.  It's not a perfect film - but a damn good one.  If more films follow this example, the movie-musical can make a come back.This DVD is about as good as we could've hoped.  BE WARNED - there are a lot of cookies hidden on the menus.  If you go to the ""deleted scenes"" menu, go left.  A Windmill will appear and take you to a nice outtake from the ""Your Song"" bit where Nicole and Ewen completely lose it.  As for the rest, you'll have to find them yourself."	5.0	Great DVD!	2002-01-18	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3VX58UK0J9NJJ	J. S. Lang	For people whose attention span can be measured only in nanoseconds, this movie must be a treat--a perpetual motion machine, never giving the viewer time to think, otherwise the poor soul might perceive what an emptiness it all is.  The generation who grew up on video games and MTV no doubt loved it (or did it move too slow for them?), but we over-40 dinosaurs found the kaleidoscopic nonsense a bit much, not to mention the tomfoolery of transplanting pop music standards into the Paris of 1900.  Granted, Nicole Kidman singing 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend' was rather amusing, but most of the songs were put over badly, and the attempt to mine humor from this--the foppish men singing 'Like a Virgin' comes to mind--failed to get a laugh out of me, sorry.  I rather like Ewan McGregor, but the poor chap was all at sea in this mess, and God knows he sure never be allowed to sing, ever, nor should anyone, under penalty of long imprisonment, be allowed to sing (or quote) Elton John's 'Your Song' on film, to the end of time.  (There are, heaven knows, hundreds of much better 'I really love you, baby' songs in the pop reportoire, and I don't think Sir (or Madame?) Elton needs any extra cash at this point.) Toulouse-Lautrec and his entourage were, I gather, supposed to provide some Three Stooges style comic relief throughout, but they were annoying as all get-out.  The movie gives the impression of being designed by a committee, with the members decided that huge profits could be repeated by combining two sexy stars (Kidman and McGregor), constant sexual innuendo (about as subtle as a wounded grizzly), songs that everyone was familiar with (whether the songs were good or not, or fit the historical period), loads of color and filters, and a spastic camera, topped off with a film editor who must've drunk a cocktail of coffee and speed (with a side dish of Ecstasy).Watching the very talented Jim Broadbent made me a little nostalgic for another (and a thousand times better) musical film in which he shone, Topsy-Turvy, with him as operetta composer William Gilbert (of Gilbert and Sullivan fame), in a movie that wonderfully evoked the late Victorian theatre world (and included some fabulous songs, of course).  Moulin Rouge did not evoke the Paris cabaret scene of 1900, rather, it put the scene on LSD and then set fire to it.  The 1952 John Huston film Moulin Rouge, though not a five-star classic, does a decent job of capturing that world (and, thank heavens, no horrible songs and off-key singers).  Maybe someone trying to buy or rent this 2001 bit of mess will, by accident, pick up Huston's film instead.	1.0	Those with ADD Will Love It...	2008-05-10	12	6	6
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2YU5RUOKVCMMF	J. Tessler	A question I'd like to pose to the admirers of this film and it's DVD counterpart: Amongst the *Goodies* found on the double disk release, was &quot;The Story&quot; (or ANY story or narrative, for that matter) found anywhere? Maybe tucked away in some of the storyboards? Maybe in some obscure Easter Egg?I give the movie two stars primarily for the fine, sharp cinematography of Donald McAlpine and beautiful production design by Catherine Martin, but the director Baz Luhrmann, though a very capable producer (having birthed this 127 minute long MTV video), is cleary suffering from &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot; syndrome.

Anyway on to the stars, Ewan and Nicole, again WOW!  Who knew these two had voices like that, and as for John L ! Well what can you say except exceptional....

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1A5TI55TU0V9Y	Julie Clawson	&quot;This is a story about truth, beauty, freedom, and above all love,&quot; so says the self proclaimed purpose of the movie.  In truth, it is a movie about all those things and in addition it is a movie about art and redemption.Simply put, Moulin Rouge is the story of a young writer who through a strange turn of events lands the job of writing the play &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot; for the Moulin Rouge.  Along the way, he falls in love with the star and although she is forbidden to love him, the relationship develops and transforms both of their lives.  As a plotline, the story is simplistic and trite, but the movie as a whole is a stunning masterpiece.Part of what makes it so amazing is that it is completely a postmodern movie - a text that comments on itself.  It is a movie that is aware that it is a movie and so in a very serious way does not take itself seriously.  But within this movie they create a play that is more true to reality that reality itself appears.  The multiple layers and subtle commentary on the nature of art turn a cliched story into an engaging and moving wonder.It does not take long as one watches to realize that this is a very different movie.  That fact begins to sink in when during the first scene an unconscious Argentinian falls through the roof, Ewan McGregor breaks in the opening lines of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (in 1900 Paris), and the Green Fairy jumps off the Absinthe bottle.  For the first half hour one is bombarded with an almost dizzying overload of sight and sound. (you have to get the dvd to truly appreciate all that went into making those scenes) The use of popular song lyrics (Beatles, Madonna) as part of the regular dialogue is brillant.  The characters seem to be having meaningful and tender conversations, but we the audience are forced to filter that through the fact that we have heard the words that they are saying numerous times before on the radio.  It makes one really question if anything one ever says it truly origenal or undetermined by culture. (Plus one realizes that Ewan McGregor's version of &quot;Your Song&quot; is better than Elton John's).But beyond the art, this movie tells a beautiful story of redemption.  Satine (Nicole Kidman) is a prostitute who is wrapped up in a life of loveless relationships and who cares only about fame and money.  During the course of the movie, she is redeemed through true love, forgiveness, and mercy by Ewan McGregor's character Christian (yes, that's his name, quite fitting isn't it?).  So it becomes under all of its layers a story of true love and caring about what is really important in life.This is a great movie, but it is not for everyone.  It is not entertainment, it is art. The unintellectual and those who dislike musicals should stay away, but if you love art and enjoy a profound story get this movie.p.s. get the dvd and find all the hidden tracks (like Nicole and Ewan goofing off Kareoke style to a song)	5.0	a postmodern masterpiece	2002-01-30	10	8	2

It's touching, sweet,romantic and breathtaking. It's one of the best tales of forbiden love that I have ever viewed. The movie stars Niclole Kidman as Satine, the young and beautiful lead showgirl at the Moulin Rouge, who wants more that anything to be a really actress. And, Ewan McGregor, who plays Christian, a very optamistic writer who came to Paris looking for love. The chemistary between Nicloe and Ewan is perfect, and so is the mix of music from &quot;The sound of Music&quot; to &quot;I will Always Love You.&quot; There voices are so wonderful to hear, that it makes you sit down close your eyes an just listen. The special effects in the movie are just so crazy that it becomes magical. Moulin Rouge will make you believe that the most important thing of all is to love and be loved in return.	5.0	Dazziling	2002-02-01	1	1	0

I loved it.  But I do understand if some people don't like it, but honestly people, if you don't like it, at least come up with a plausible reason for it.  Most of the negative reviews I've read from this sight were so baseless I was wondering if they were even watching the same movie.As for me, it's the most addicting movie I've ever seen in my life.  The music is awesome and the acting superb.  Ewan and Nicole totally blew me away with their amazing singing abilities.

Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are brilliant actors and singers.  Jim Broadbent is amazing, portraying the entire range of emotions with incredible skill.  Richard Roxburgh is hilarious, and deeply frightening.  Every actor in this film is good.  I hope we'll see more from our unconscious Argentinean friend, Jacek Koman (who is actually Polish!!).  The sights and sounds in this movie range from blatantly gorgeous to sweetly subtle.  It gives you more emotion than you've ever thought about going through in a few hours.Also, the DVD extras are absolutely amazing.  You'll spend hours playing with the extras, and hunting for &quot;easter eggs&quot;.  The Easter eggs are great!  I also like the &quot;Behind the Red Curtain&quot; feature.  It has some great commentary by Baz and Catherine Martin, and some interesting footage.  All-in-all, the best DVD I've ever played with... granted, I haven't seen many, but this one has kept me entertained for days!!Like many have said.. it's a love it or hate it movie.

Or you hate it. When I began watching it with my parents, they both left near the beginning of it, claiming that it was ""too weird"". And I admit, it is strange. It is set in the 1900's yet the songs are mainly modern pop music (i.e - Nirvana ""Smells like Teen Spirit). And, plus, the beginning is like a total drug trip. But I stayed and finished watching and, and I must say, I am glad that I did. The love story is incredibly beautiful (read: tragic); and Ewan was perfect. I don't care for Nicole Kidman as a rule, but her acting was good as Satine. As the movie progresses, her character grows as Christian and Satine's love grows. I think Directer-man Baz has got the whole forbidden-love scenario down pat. Anyways, I think the bottom line for this movie is: just give it a chance. Some parts are just too amazing to miss. It's just so passionate!

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2DB0OEGESYWD6	Justin S. Allen	Several adjectives come to mind when watching this movie; from brilliant and beautiful, to annoying and stupid. Baz Luhrman needs to... make up his mind. Does he want to make beautiful movies that unfold like a series of brilliant moving photographs, or does he want to make infantile drivel where he can use painful close-ups, pointless fast motion film, and tacked on sound effects that would make the producers of America's Funniest Home Videos blush? I just hate having to subject myself to the latter to get to the former. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are both great. They somehow manage to maintain some dignity despite some the [junk] they are asked to do, say, and sing. If I were to rate it only on cinematography or art direction, I would give it an A+. This is a beautiful, train wreck of a movie. And though not everyone dies, the casualties are high.	2.0	...mess	2001-06-03	6	4	2

The beginning can be hard to get through the first time, but with subsequent viewings it is all great. Kidman and McGregor capture you right away with their wonderful acting and voices. I cannot say enough about this movie. It is SO GOOD! It should have definitely taken home the Best Picture Oscar (although I really liked A Beautiful Mind.) Just buy it...

You feel that the director is trying to compensate the lack of real heart or originality  with eye candy and overblown orchestrations.MacGregor's accent that veers queasily between the US and Scotland.One of the worst pieces of music ever to mar a closing credit sequence.The inescapeable feeling that you just wasted two hours of your life to witness Baz Luhrmann's ego trip.Not really recommended."	2.0	More isn't better	2002-04-23	13	9	4
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1K7MTGNIQ89RR	Kandy	When I saw the ads for &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; last summer, I was skeptic. I thought that it looked silly and that musicals were becoming outdated. After hearing about all of the acclaim and recognition it received, I gave it a chance -- an action I did not regret. The plot revolves around a courtesan in the Moulin Rouge and a bohemian writer who fall in love but a jealous duke, who holds the deeds to the brothel, is a barrier.The movie really starts shining when the two lovebirds meet in a hilarious bedroom scene. The costumes, sets, and music are beautifully extravagant but the finale scene is the best, where the designers and art directors put most Las Vegas shows to shame. The story is touching and I hate to admit it but I almost cried in the end.Non-believers will have no choice but to be impressed visually and to be affected emotionally. Those who are already fans will enjoy the extended music scenes and appease their curiousity regarding the minds and labour that went into the project. I highly recommend this for everyone.	5.0	One of the Best Musicals Ever!	2002-06-24	0	0	0

Noticed that theres no gray line here? either people love this film or either they hate it. True ,this film is not for everyone. It is however very bold in what it tries to do, sometimes it does pull it off, other times it does not. the story is stereotypical, the dialog not so snappy but its derived from the Orpheus Myth. This film is not for dialog ,or its what may seem very typical story. Any major myth we live with will seem stereotypical ,and this story does here too, but its told very stylistically and through the device of 20th century songs ranging from the pop to the rock to the classics pulls of what it set out to achieve. a modern musical.dialog? script? go watch lawrence of arabia then.want a story? go watch citizen kanewant to breathe fresh cinematic air ?,an old air turned new? watch this.there is a reason myths survive in film strongly,and films last. if you see this from a cliched perspective, you will get a bad perception.Just let Mr Luhrmann take you through his imagination...and dont let the fast cuts fool you.Despite its conveying of feelings and story through song, like any myth a movie would be based on. This has layers, you start peeling them and they deepen.THEn a truly classic movie is made.any movie that delights critics orgasmically and infuriates the rest like a pungent smell is truly the making of a classic.dont believe me?take out your cinema history books...or go over the afi top 100 movie list. see how many good movies were panned horribly by some and praised by some.	4.0	:)	2002-05-05	4	1	3

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1CJN46JPSAC44	"Karen Metcalfe ""Fluffy"""	"Ewan McGregor does an astounding job as the ideal man, a romantic poet intent on having a star prostitute (Nicole Kidman) fall in love with him. It's very original, with brash colors and contrasts to help juxtapose the beautiful romance. My personal favorite touch was the modern pop music in an 1899 French setting. If you want to fall back on a traditional soft-colors romance, look elsewhere. A romantic soul with an open mind will truly appreciate this masterpiece. The only complaint I had with the movie was the ""Like a Vigin"" scene, which was stupid and unneeded."	5.0	I'm still crying!!	2005-07-06	3	2	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1IOJE0W1NXOSE	Karen Potts	If the title of this review sounds like an oxymoron, then you get some idea of the dichotomies in the film.  This is a weirdly wonderful, artistic film which delights the eye and the ear, and plays on the viewer's emotions.  The plot concerns a young writer (Ewan McGregor) who is mistaken for a duke by a beautiful courtesan (Nicole Kidman).  She falls in love with the writer, while playing up to the duke so that he will bankroll the play which the young man is writing for her.  The play parallels their real lives in this cat-and-mouse game where the young couple try to hide their affair from the duke.  Finally the duke catches on and threatens to kill the writer if the courtesan doesn't leave him.  McGregor and Kidman display great emotional intensity and beautiful singing voices in their starring roles, and the supporting parts are also well played.  Throw away your old preconceptions of what a musical is like and enjoy the beauty and poetry of this film.	5.0	Modern musical set in the past	2002-06-13	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2SH17ZKPJNI76	Karen Sampson Hudson	Those who watched &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; are divided into two camps: Love it or hate it.  This reviewer considers it a complete waste of time, an overwrought and silly exercise, operatic without the redeeming quality of opera music,  lurid and phantasmagoric without the redeeming lightness of camp.  In a word, perfectly horrid. The hackneyed story is filled with cliched dialogue; freshness is completely lacking.  The concept for this movie took a wrong turn somewhere early on in development, like an early prototype for an airplane that ended in disaster for all concerned.	1.0	overwrought and silly	2002-04-19	3	0	3

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A24K27DJ1R5WQK	Karl Elder	I must admit I thought the premise of the film held promise, and after my wife had expressed interest, having read the Ansen review in NEWSWEEK, I thought, why not make a date of it?Fifteen dollars poorer, I can tell you why. Although I trust Ansen's eye, I now imagine him with a feather pillow for a hind.  Or perhaps he slept through the last half.  I must have said to myself twenty-five times, &quot;Oh, now, come on, do we really need this shot?&quot;  Of course, we did not, even if this thing does win awards for art direction.  It's a lush production with just the right amount of lustiness and lust, if only one could watch it at home, DVD remote in hand, finger on fast-forward.  In that manner one might more easily recall how smoothly lyrics originally heard from the mouths of Madonna, Elton John, and Paul McCartney are integrated with the storyline, which by itself seems cleverly obtuse for the sake of avoiding hiring a writer.My wife liked this film much less than I, flatly declaring, &quot;there are parts that are bad.  Just plain bad.&quot;  Well, she's right, I believe, but I got a real kick out of the can-can scenes early on--the colors and textures are remarkably faithful to the dynamic images we all know of the Moulin Rouge--and there's a great lovers' exchange on a rooftop.  Again, however, I'm talking about action early on, that which overshadows the climax, if &quot;climax&quot; can mean or be analogous to shooting blanks.	2.0	Tim Burton on Speed without Scissors	2001-06-02	7	6	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ABQPBY4VNK40Y	Karl Flaig	Baz Luhrmann, the visual genius behind the insipid &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; finally gives us a film that's more than style over substance.  In this summer of whiz-bang, brainless insults to dead Egyptians and fallen war heroes Luhrmann delivers a film that succeeds on almost every level.Visually, Moulin Rouge stands as a feast to the eyes.  Every scene drips with ambience.  Lighting effects, set designs, miniatures, costumes, all create an ocular punch.  Match the set preparation to Baz's keen eye for framing a shot and the viewer's treated to a euphoric tapestry of colors, shapes, faces, etc.  Of course for those people raised on Jerry Bruckheimer or convinced that someone like Spielberg is an &quot;artist&quot; then Baz's high energy shot composition, over-the-top music and jump cutting will drive them batty.Moulin Rouge comes close to being something I thought I'd never call a film: art.  A bold, bright and somber at times, experiment in how a really gifted filmmaker can transform the normal banal moviegoing experience into a trip that knows nothing of time, space, history or reality.  Moulin Rouge succeeds where most films fail: the self disappears into this delightful film.  The viewer's taken to Baz's world, much as Burton attempts (sometimes successfully) with his films.In Baz's world we get the vibrant sets, the large faces, the delightful treat of hearing tired songs transformed into the first major musical on film in years.  Yes Woody Allen and Kenneth Branagh did the same thing recently, but they merely staged basic films with musical numbers.  Baz makes a whole world, sets it in his dimension's version of Paris, turn of the 20th Century and equips our stars with the lyrics to a whole variety of songs from all eras.And those songs, how much fun they are.  McGregor's initial declaration of love to Kidman is fantastic.  The mixing of Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; with the likes of &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; and &quot;Material girl&quot; along with numerous numbers gel to create a distinct flavor to every scene.  The love song medley, as heard by a rather unromantic guy such as this reviewer got me grinning - no small feat.  Even the numbers written for the movie strike a perfect balance with the familiar pieces.As far as performances, Kidman almost works totally here.  It's easily her best work since &quot;To Die For&quot; and she's got the look, and tackles her scenes with verve.  It's a pleasure to see her acting for once.  Of course her job is made tougher because her co-star shines, revealing once again why it's a shame he's in those dreadful Star Wars movies.  McGregor infuses Christian with such pain, eagerness, and giddiness that this kind of skill leaves one wondering how McGregor can ever stoop to being in a Lucas film.  Between the two McGregor's singing and acting actually carry the film.  The supporting players, most notably Jim Broadbent (Ziddler) and Richard Roxburgh quite often threaten to steal the stars' thunder.  Broadbent's carnie-like character and the seasoned age, skill and size he brings to his Ziddler generates so much energy in the film I can only hope he'll continue to find such engaging roles.  Roxburgh's Duke displays the kind of treacherous, weak villain that really can shine in a good film (plus he reminds me of the Prince from Disney's animated &quot;Robin Hood&quot;).All in all, Moulin Rouge has supplanted my previous favorite of 2001, Memento.  I can't wait to own the DVD.	5.0	Baz finally delivers a film that's more than visual fluff	2001-06-13	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ARA8SJ6IQZ1Q	"Karl Henning ""Composer & Clarinetist"""	"Extremely disappointed with this.The setting, Paris at the turn of the century, might have been so colorful, and instead it was Just Another Baz Boobscape;  he needs to step outside of himself a little bit, and approach the realization that not everybody sees the world through his lens of tawdrified sexuality.  The people on the Extra Features keep repeating that Baz is supposedly a great story-teller, so that you wonder if they believe it, simply because they keep repeating it to themselves.  Baz doesn't get anywhere near telling a story;  he is content with throwing together a quilt of clich&eacute;.  Somehow, he seems to suppose that he is doing something ""new and brilliant,"" where there isn't an idea in the whole of Moulin Rouge that doesn't come from either Vegas, or Lloyd Webber - neither of them what you would call a great artistic role model.There is (or at any rate, was) actual talent in Baz;  you can see it in ""Strictly Ballroom.""  But he needs an editor (or some other externally applied self-criticism faculty).  Pacing is appalling;  he alternates between rushing through an absence of narration, and tedious driving the same shtick into the ground.  The presentation is not stylized, as the commentary would have you believe;  only a cobbling out of shredded pop platitude.  ""The Boy"" spouts five pop-song lines about love, inviting us to consider how deep his understanding of love is ... well, exactly ... sets the tone for the whole.  Baz also tries to stretch Elton John's ""Your Song"" out to Mahlerian dimensions, at a stroke setting a new benchmark for Bloat.  If his goal was to create an audience who cringe involuntarily whenever they hear the phrase, ""It's a little bit funny,"" then perhaps the movie might be considered a kind of Pavlovian success.Best acting in the film was Jim Broadbent.  Ewan MacGregor wasn't bad, it is only that his character is two-dimensional at fullest, a role which hardly made any demands on him;  his voice is fair, but monochrome, too consistently giving a just-this-side-of-strained sound, which wears, in a movie which would make wearisomeness a virtue.  It is hard to believe that Nicole Kidman is dying of consumption, another failed bit of storytelling on Baz's part (hint:  since so much of the movie is blue-ish tint, the audience has no clue that a certain two minutes of blue tint is supposed to imbue Kidman with Consumptive Pallor).  We might feel sorry for their thwarted love, if only we could believe that there was actual love there, where there was only a kind of pop-song medley.Toulouse Lautrec might have been an interesting cultural element of the movie, only Baz trivializes him into just another dwarf element in little more than a visual circus.  The comic-book shallowness, which in ""Strictly Ballroom"" is charmingly transcended ... is ineluctable Narrative Death in ""Moulin Rouge.""  We saw this for professional reasons, and had hoped for rather better.  It is with genuine sorrow that we acknowledge that we need never see it again."	1.0	Exceeded Low Expectations, in the Worst Way	2004-04-05	24	14	10

I normally think these kinds of forums should stick to commentary about the production skills or acting or writing of a movie. In this case, I want to go along with others who have talked about personal responses to this amazing movie. I related a lot to Satine. As the reviews point out she is as much a hero in this as Christian. They just have different roads to follow before they can be what I would call redeemed. I opted in my 20's for a comfortable life and I think my reasons were not bad reasons. I was not a materialistic person. I care about people and am voting Kerry even though it might hurt me financially. Just like Satine I found myself a little trapped. I met the love of my life 10 years ago. I denied my feelings for him because his life choices were sort of threatening I guess. He's a school teacher and makes much less money than I do. I hear he is very happy and now married with two kids. I married a man with a lot of money and we eventually got divorced due to all the cheating and the fact that he spent more time with his cars than he ever did with me. Good thing we did not have kids. I did not follow all of my values and I regret not having tried to make things work with the wonderful guy. This movie and the reviews about it make me want to reevaluate how I live my life. I might not be with the man I love but then again neither is Satine since she dies. I do feel like I can not be afraid to love the next penniless poet I meet though. I also think I have become too wedded to my things just like my ex-husband.	5.0	Van Nuys, CA	2004-10-19	10	6	4

I really can't find the words to express the feelings that Moulin Rouge evoked in me... Moulin Rouge contains the presences (lyrics/melodies) of David Bowie, Elton John, Marilyn Monroe, T.

I thought the music was tremendous, I loved Ewan McGregor's voice, as well as Nicoles.  Some of the camera movement was too much, but the scenery, story line, movement of the movie and the music were great.I watched this movie 3 times in 2 days because of the music and the touching love story.  I'm not a critic, but it was much more fulfilling to me as a movie goer than the crash and burn movies like Swordfish.  Nor was there any full nudity, or even risque nudity, no cursing, no drugs, warlords, or fighting.  Just the age old story of love, being love, and being touched by love.Bohemia is &quot;out there&quot; and this movie is not mainstream movie making.

Now, this would be a bad choice for those of you who don't like musicals, but the music, AND ESPECIALLY SINGING in this movie are fantastic. The way that they tie famous songs into the story line is finominal, and it is also extremely nice (for a change) that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman could keep you liking their relationship on a non-sexual level was amazing! The complex characteristics and charm to all the characters is also amazing! Satine, the exotic, (but fragile) can-can dancers/cortisan, Christian, the sweet, bohemian spirated penniless writer with an obsession with love, the duke, though not totally complex, is appauling, and Zidler, who though he wants the best, tries to stay out of any trouble.

Bourn ""bohemiangirlpdx"""	"From the previews, I thought that ""Moulin Rouge"" would be a more traditional movie musical with a classic love triangle between the beautiful woman, the poor artist who truly loves her and the rich man who can give her everything she wants EXCEPT true love--no doubt ending tragically. In fact, the anticipation of a tragic ending kept me from seeing ""Moulin Rouge"" when it was in the theaters.  I just wasn't in the mood for that at the time.Boy, did I misread the tone of the movie!  What a shock I had when, shortly into the film, I caught strains of ""The Sound of Music."" Just what were those hills doing ""alive"" in fin-de-siecle Paris?, I wondered. That was just the first of many songs from more recent decades that made surprisingly fun appearances in ""Moulin Rouge."" At first, I wondered what was going on, and then I relaxed to enjoy the hilarious ride.In ""Moulin Rouge,"" director Baz Luhrmann (of the equally funny ""Strictly Ballroom"") sets out to revive the musical.  He does a stellar job of it!  The outlandish sets and glamorous costume are a feast for the eyes.The plot never slows down, and the musical numbers never leave you feeling that the action has stopped for someone to sing.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor--yes, reportedly we hear their voices, no Milli Vanilli-esque lip-syncing--sound amazing.  They also show a real flair for physical commedy.  An early scene in which Kidman mistakes McGregor for the wealthy duke, and then has to conceal him when the real duke arrives in her dressing room is reminiscent of similar ""hide-the-lover"" scenes in ""The Marriage of Figaro.""My only regret was not seeing it on the big screen.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A38PB1IVN3E5XE	Keith Gleason	I'm not sure where to start this review about how awful I thought this movie was. I guess i'll start with Baz Lurhman's direction, for those who are unfamiliar with his work he's the auteur behind the equally bad Romeo &amp; Juliet movie of a few years ago, Strictly Ballroom &amp; the Sunscreen song. I get the impression from his work that he is the kind of director who loves Shakespeare and is a fan of musicals but has come from the Roland Emmerich (ID4, Godzilla) school of directing. He's covered up this movie with nothing but flashy set pieces, special effects, and a musical that comprises itself with modern music ranging from Madonna to Queen instead of trying to be original and tell a good story or have new and fresh music for that matter. If your trying to make a musical set in the past why would you use a Madonna song? there's plenty of talented musicians out there who could write original material for this movie but I guess that would cut out the audience that this movie targets (MTV zombies). This movie is put together like a big music video with no shot lasting longer than three seconds in fact I saw a video the other day for this movie and I couldn't tell the difference between the two. I really wish Baz Luhrman would go do work on broadway so I wouldn't have to worry about him making more movies. As far as musicals go, this is probably one of the worst i've ever seen. Musicals aren't really my forte but I have seen some great ones such as Grease, Wizard of Oz, Little shop of Horrors, and several Disney films all of which are miles better. Also In case you haven't figured out yet by the movie trailers the Moulin Rouge is a story of Love. Sure enough Baz beats you over the head with the concept of love every five minutes on the minute, much in the same way Steven Soderbergh does in traffic with his drugs are bad message. Does anyone on this planet not understand the concept of love or the concept of drugs are bad for that matter? I'm glad we have these stupid filmmakers to tell us these obvious messages instead of entertaining us. If your looking for an entertaining movie about love my recommendations are Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Life Is Beautiful, or Shakespeare in Love.

Probably because its better quality (no kidding).If you haven't seen the movie, here's a brief summary:Moulin Rouge is a musical that tells the story of Christian, a writer, who moves to Paris {Montmarte} in 1900...and ends up writing a play for the Moulin Rouge...and falling in love with the nightclub's star act, Satine. Filled with awesome renditions of reworked songs from the Beatles, Elton John and more...laughter and sadness (I cried the first 3 times I watched it)... and of course an evil villian, &quot;The Duke&quot;, who stands in the way of Christian and Satine's love.If I could give this ten stars, I would give it ten. This goofy, unique, romantic, melodic, comedic, dramatic movie definitely deserves it.	5.0	all you need is &lt;this DVD&gt; love...	2003-07-13	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	APA46Q1FEEVJU	"Kelley M. Frankovitch ""kfrankovitch"""	I went into this movie having read that it is loosely based on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, but aside from that I had few expectations. In many ways, I think that that is the perfect way to go into this movie.From the beginning, you are thrust into an often frenzied always magical world of sin and decadence. The characters refer to themselves as &quot;creatures of the underworld.&quot; But there is no love for such creatures ... or is there?I found it remarkable to see this tragic love story fleshed out in such an inventive way. I was utterly absorbed by the beauty and sorrow of the people whose lives are played out under the glitz and glamour of the Moulin Rouge.Then of course there is the music. I was somewhat skeptical of the use of popular music, rather than music written for the movie. I had nothing to be skeptical about. The one original song is a showstopper and all of the popular songs are arranged so they fit flawlessly in the fabric of the show. They take the pop songs and make them their own by using beautiful (and often dramatic) arrangements and by altering some of the lyrics. I only hope that this movie can inspire more movie musicals of the same caliber.Though Moulin Rouge may not be everyone's cup of tea, it's certainly worth a try. It represents a kind of beauty in film that we rarely see these days. So, dismiss all those jaded notions and enjoy the bohemian extravaganza that is Moulin Rouge!	5.0	Love it or hate it, you simply can't ignore it!	2001-06-11	0	0	0

If you love musicals, many kinds of music, and awsome dancing youll love this movie. The whole movie is an adventure of colors and sounds.  The beatiful settings make your come alive and you eyes dance. You fall in love with the tradgic love story of Satine and her young writer.  This is the best movie of the year.

There were some things that could have been better (Baz's over use of quick visuals detracted from many of the scenes, making it difficult to fully enjoy the costumes and dancing, the &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; number was TOO long and I never quite bought the all consuming love between the movie's stars), but for a movie experience it was as close to perfect as you can get these days!I felt swept away, loved the use of current classic pop mixed with original songs, the costuming and visuals would have made Tim Burton jealous and the supporting cast was excellent. It is definitely a film I will see again at the theater AND I will own on DVD.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A7IIPRUAEZ2N6	Kendrik Lau	"When I first heard about ""Moulin Rouge"", I really, REALLY had no interest in it whatsoever, thinking that it is based on one of those bad Broadway shows that the public was bamboozled by Holier-than-thou critics into thinking that they were so great. I, for one, is not into showtunes. Anybody can write a musical, given the sad state of affairs nowadays. Most of the songs sound like something you just make it up as you go along.When a friend of mine got Moulin Rogue on DVD, once again, I really, REALLY resisted in watching it. For me, musicals began with the Sound of Music and ended with Grease. Yes, a maniacal Madonna fan like me have yet to see EVITA in its entirety, that goes to show you that I HATE musicals in general.But as my friend watch the movie, I was drawn into the film by the incredible music, and finally, in the entire film itself.Yes, this hater of musical has been converted. Well, I still hate musicals in general, but when they are as good as Moulin Rouge, I goes into full obsession mode. Yes, I love this movie! The look, the music! And yes...HUNKY Ewan MacGregor has a great singing voice. He did such a great job that it is hard to believe he is the same actor who woodenly plowed through the three Star Wars prequel movies.Yes Ewan all is forgiven.Not to say that Moulin Rouge is perfect. The remake of Like A Virgin was funny until it became a full-blown gay Will & Grace ""Just Jack"" production. ""The Show Must Go On"" is another prime example of why I dislike musicals: it has no discernable melodies. But still, watching Ewan and have his voice seduce you is worth the experience.Oh, did I mentioned Nicole Kidman? Yes, she is a great singer to.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1M4027KTXCH5J	Kevin A. Little	Okay, I admit it, Moulin Rouge is NOT for everyone.  Just reading through the reviews included here, people either seem to love it tremendously or hate it vehemently.  I fall into the former category, and after viewing the DVD and the plethora of bonus features, I am even more convinced that this movie is a masterpiece of directorial vision.Some have complained that the music is not original.  Does it really matter, though, so long as the songs support the story?  Here, they support not only the story but the idealism of the characters and the world in which they live.As Luhrmann explains on one of the many interviews with him on the DVD, the Moulin Rouge (the club, not the movie) was like a rave, like &quot;the greatest rave ever.&quot;  That not only sums up the Moulin Rouge, but also Luhrmann's approach to making this movie.  This movie is a rave, a bounty of sights and sound that will be immediately understood by the Generation X and Generation Y rave culture.Aided by incredible performances by two leads who prove they have immensely appealing and powerful voices, Moulin Rouge completely defies expectations, even if one has seen the movie over and over again.One has to tip a hat to 20th Century Fox, who took a page out of Dreamworks' book by releasing such an expansive DVD right at the start of awards season.  Like Dreamworks did with Gladiator last year, providing so many behind-the-scenes glimpses at the making of Moulin Rouge circumvents the Academy rules that you can't mail out anything other than the movie itself to Academy members.  Knowing that Academy members will scarf up this DVD in droves, 20th Century makes an excellent case for Moulin Rouge to get nominated for a bevy of Oscars, although admittedly most of these will probably be in the craft categories.  But those nominations will certainly be well-deserved.	5.0	Incredible DVD presentation of a ground-breaking movie	2001-12-19	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AV04BU6UUSSB7	kevin parlagreco	Moulin Rouge was a 2 hour freight train, that continually flew at you with no hint of stoping. Being a musical you have to allow for the characters to break out into song and dance. But the music is amazing, renditions of Madonna's &quot;LIke a Virgin&quot;, the Police's &quot;Roxanne&quot;, Elton John's &quot;Your song&quot; and many more allow the film to be open to all age's. And be enjoyable just for simple recognition. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor where fantastic. Nicole sings with the elegance of a Maralyn Monroe(literally ) , and the range on Ewan tops that of the great David Bowie. Completely surprising. The story is full and dramatic. The music adds to the climatic points of the film. Baz Lehrman is a genious. He tells you that your one out of two main characters are dead in the first five minutes of the film. But he is still able to bring full emotion when you are incapable of tearing your eye's away from the screen as the character die's. This is one of the most wonderful current films. When a world full of general public are all forming together and enjoying film like &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, and &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; , the real film fans out there have Baz Lehrman.	5.0	most original for hollywood in a while.	2001-08-24	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A29H7KDKSBRVUC	Kevin Purcell	From Baz Luhrman, director of Strictly Balroom and Romeo+Juliet, comes a redefiniton of the musical. A stunning pictorial fantasy that teaches it's audience 'the greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.'Both Ewin McGregor and Nicole Kidman give superb performances, both revealing suprising musical talent. Nicole is absolutely picturesque.The cinematography is true Baz Luhrman. At points a little bit nauseating to watch, but even those scenes are essential to give the viewer a sense of the chaos that was the bohemian revolution.About the only thing that I did not care for in this movie was John Liguizimo, who plays Tolouse La Trec. His accent and odd stature is a bit annoying, but is a point easily overlooked in this modern-day musical masterpiece	5.0	The best DVD I own!!	2001-12-25	5	4	1

And the guts it took to make it...I mean musicals haven't been ""in"" since the 70s and no one could forsee this one being any different.  But Baz Lurhman took a big leap and gave a rebirth to the movie musical in excellent fashion.  The casting didn't hurt either, but this story is timeless and an immediate classic.  Both Ewan and Nicole did really well in this movie.  And they had to strike a good balance between the broad comedy and romanticism and drama this movie throws together in the same beat sometimes.  Nicole sounded great and also proved her vocal chops along with Ewan on the soundtrack(s) to the movie.  But the 2 of them together were the real magic (along with Baz's unique vision for storytelling) and I only wish more people would accept this movie as one of the greatest not only musicals but movies ever.  And without this big gamble, there would be no Chicago."	5.0	Very Underappreciated Work	2003-11-15	1	0	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	At the end of the 19th century a young aspiring bohemian Brit, Christian (Ewan McGregor), moves into Montmartre, a Parisian district, to begin to write about love.  Despite Christian's awareness of his lack of experiences in love he sets out to try to conquer the world with his ambitions.  However, Christian's writings are momentarily stopped as he is interrupted by his neighbor's theatrical rehearsals, which leads him into an acting career.  Christian's new career leads him into the glamorous night club Moulin Rouge where all decadent behaviors have a haven.  It also opens up the doors to love and strong affection as Christian falls in love with Satine (Nicole Kidman).  This love affair is the beginning of a romantic tragedy as Christian and Satine have to fight for each other and their never-ending love.Moulin Rouge is visually stunning and aurally delightful as it displays one of the most ancient themes of art and theater.  The colors and music that Luhrmann uses project a feeling of desire of our inner most secrets.  These feelings are openly expressed as they are displayed on the screen with a relaxed attitude, which enhances the audience's willingness to embrace the story.  The songs that are sung in Moulin Rouge are flirtatious as they express the ideas, feelings, and values of the film.  In the end, Luhrmann creates a marvelous cinematic experience, which will be remembered for a long time.	5.0	Marvelous cinematic experience of never-ending love...	2004-04-22	0	0	0

I've never once liked Ewan McGregor in anything (what the hell was Trainspotting, anyway?) he did, but WOW! It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, but I think it is a pre-requisite that you watch this movie as an open-minded person. After all, it is about bohemian principles! The only negative comments I've personally heard are from people who are so closed to the freedoms of expressions of artists that they would never be able to hold onto the meaning: The only thing you NEED to learn is just to love and be loved in return. What a fantastic ideology! This is a relatively clean, absolutely hilarious (the scene where McGregor and Kidman are first alone together is a riot!), childlike view of what could be perceived as a very dark and oppressive situation, and it brings it fantastically (and by that I mean ""with fantasy"") into your world by incorporating modern music into an age-old story.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A4QMXEUMKA4Q7	kjmatthews	This is an excellent film.  What makes it excellent is not its songs nor the voices that sing them, not its plot, not the actors nor their performances.  The songs are reworkings of classic pop tunes, and the voices are decent enough for anyone except those expecting professionally trained vocalists (at least it isn't dubbed!).  The plot and its execution are patchworks of cliches: boy falls in love, loses girl, gets girl, tragedy strikes; lowly writer wins the love of &quot;high&quot; and beautiful courtesan.  This film's spectacular accomplishment is the combining of film AND musical theater cliches into a cohesive whole in a way that, to my knowledge, has never been done before.  In theater, it is impossible to change settings in the course of a song as many times as they do - the rendition of &quot;Roxanne&quot; is particularly brilliant in this respect.  In the movies, where everything is &quot;believability,&quot; it is difficult to get away with the overdone acting that is characteristic of this film.  The transitions between dialogue and song are often much smoother than in theater (except in the beginning, where it is intentional), as if one were simply weaving a thread of musical theater into and out of the film.The principle on which the movie was built seems to be an over-the-top representation of both genres: the close-ups are, at times, outrageous; the classic musical numbers are exaggerated (see the &quot;Can-can&quot; or &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;); the scenes in the Moulin Rouge are often enormously disorienting to the point of disrupting one's sense of space and time; the acting is intentionally overdone to the point of melodrama.All of these techniques create an atmosphere in which sincere, straightforward emotion have no place.  But when such emotions ARE expressed, they are set in such high relief against the rest of the film that the viewer forgets that they are &quot;cliche&quot; or as old as time.  And that ability to do that is nothing short of brilliant.	5.0	A brilliant combining of cliches	2001-12-28	1	1	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ABYCU2X4TI7Q3	K. Meyers	"Moulin Rouge is an incredible movie that many people did not give a chance. It is a beautiful love story and musical, and Nicole Kidman (Satine) and Ewan McGregor (Christian) not only act but sing, really showing how talented they are. Through a course of mistaken identities, Satine, the Moulin Rouge's hot commodity, and Christian, a poor and naive writer, meet and eventually fall in love. Neither of them know that Satine has TB and is slowly dying. Satine's affections are also being ""bought"" by the man who is funding her first big show, which is her chance to get out of the Moulin Rouge.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR	"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl"""	Baz Luhrmann has reached back into history and brought forward both a story and a style, and in doing so has proved that he is able to make some of the best films in the world. This is the kind of film that will really polarise viewers. You are either going to hate this film or fall in love with it. I don't think there will be any middle ground.Moulin Rouge is the third in what Luhrmann calls his 'Red Curtain' series, the first two being Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet. He also refers to this as 'audience participation cinema' where the audience makes a conscious decision to become part of the film. With Moulin Rouge, he has succeed in producing a film that is both a great joy and a sorrow to be a part of. While similar in underlying style to the first two films, Moulin Rouge goes beyond both these films into a whole new world. This is a musical, a musical of the type that we have not seen since the heyday of such great films as The Sound Of Music. While it is a musical, Luhrmann has brought this style forward into the 21st century. The music that has been used is contemporary popular music. We hear songs such as Like A Virgin, Your Song and Roxanne. The use of these and many others is brilliant. Not only does it make this a contemporary musical, but each of these songs has a context that we are used to hearing them in. They each mean something to us and have an association in our mind. Luhrmann has used this existing meaning with great skill, both to make it clear what a character feels when they sing that song, as well as using them jarringly out of context to great comedic effect. The majority of the songs have been set to an orchestral backing. Maybe I am showing my age, but I think they sound better with the rich backing of a full orchestra.While this is a musical, it is also both a comedy and a tragedy. Luhrmann calls them high comedy and high tragedy. We cover an incredible range of styles, both in film and music. In a few short scenes we can move from a drama to a music hall-type number. Then we more into high comedy and a Gilbert and Sullivan style. From there we return to a 40s style set piece and then on to high tragedy and scenes that tug at the heartstrings.To those that think two people breaking into song in the middle of a film is silly, then you are really going to miss out on something rather special. I think people have missed the direct use of song in film. Music speaks to a different part of us and love expressed in music seems far deeper than mere words can express. Imagine the scene at the end of An Officer And A Gentleman without the music. I don't see songs as out of place in this kind of film but almost a necessity as the feeling between the characters becomes greater than can be expressed without song and music - it transcends the limitations of language.All the actors in this film bring home brilliant performances. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are perfect as our two ill-fated lovers. Nicole can sing. In fact, she sings extremely well. She is also a consummate actor who brings the part of Satine to life with great skill. You cannot help but to be drawn to her character, and if I may be so bold, there is no doubt that Nicole is a very beautiful woman and the costumes in this film are incredible. Ewan also cuts a very dashing figure in his part. The sets and costumes are a visual spectacular; rich colours, incredible backdrops. All come together to make this an incredibly rich visual feast. Everywhere that you look there is something happening, something colourful, some movement and dance. You will not catch everything the first time you see this film, and most viewers will want to enjoy this film multiple times.The pace of the film is sometimes neck-breaking. Early in the film where we first 'go down the rabbit hole' the pace is manic. Some may find it extreme, with a wild ride of images bombarding the viewer and the number of edits per second incredible. This is all entirely intentional and sets the tone and feel of the Moulin Rouge, and the world that the director is creating for his story. At no time during the film will you have time to be bored. The energy levels in the film are breathtaking. The speed and energy in the dance routines are just amazing.The story is a simple one, timeless and beautiful as well as sad. A young courtesan is caught between her love for a young penniless writer, and a rich but evil duke. The owner of the Moulin Rouge needs money and he is using Satine to draw in the duke to finance his new venture. He hopes to convert the Moulin Rouge into a theatre and is betting on a new play he is having written. The play is being written by the Bohemians. The Bohemians are having a little trouble with the play and fate brings them together with an aspiring young writer, Christian, who has just moved to Paris. Christian falls in love with Satine. This leads to problems as Satine and the Moulin Rouge need the duke for his money, and he is not going to invest in the new theatre unless Satine is his. Christian also needs the duke as he is financing the play he is writing with the Bohemians. The play that is being written within the film becomes a reflection of the world of the film and leads to the final confrontation. Fate intervenes to make this a tragedy. While this is a tragedy, we are left with the conviction that there is love in the world.	4.0	A timeless movie!	2004-12-29	4	3	1

The story, so simple at it's heart, is so heart wrenchingly beautiful because of it's simplicity. however, I've found that this movie is a hit or miss: You loathe it or you love it uncondionally. However, studies have shown that opened minded and creative people liked Moulin Rouge! better than the close minded and practical people! lol, so do yourself a favor and see this movie.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2Q07KQAAFWVL7	Kristoffer Infante	"At first, I was a little put off by the sheer craziness of the film's first ten minutes. But once the film retreats a takes a break, you start to enjoy the opulent setting of 1900 Paris, the sweet and tender songs of today and yesterday, the alluring costumes, and the very good acting involved.Nicole Kidman is Satine, a courtesan working at the Moulin Rouge who desperately wants to be an actress. (I can relate to that!) Ewan McGregor plays Christian, the young writer who falls in love with Satine and they begin their romance by singing love tunes to each other. There are many songs here such as: Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" and ""Material Girl,"" Elton John's ""How Wonderful,"" LaBelle's ""Lady Marmalade"" (already a single's hit in the country) and many others! The songs are used to convey the characters' emotions.Their obstacle is the Duke of Worcester, played by Richard Roxbaugh, who wants to marry Satine and help make her the actress she's always wanted to be. However, she can't stay away from Christian, which drives the Duke mad! He threatens to have Christian killed if she doesn't make love to him! She can't do it, and runs back to Christian! They have their big night at the Moulin Rouge when their musical opens. It ends when Satine, dying from an inherent disease, dies on stage in Christian's arms. A very sad moment, that, strangely, was very effective! Not like other sappy films that are manipulative with their point (i.e. PAY IT FORWARD).John Leguizamo also lends a hand, playing the miniature artist/painter Henri Toulouse-Lautrec who helps Christian with his writing his musical for the Moulin Rouge. (A role previously played by Jose Ferrer in John Huston's 1952 version of MOULIN ROUGE.)Directed by Australian director Baz Luhrmann, who also directed STRICTLY BALLROOM and ROMEO + JULIET, brings a new and exciting tale that has been told quite often. Luhrmann also wrote the script with Craig Pearce.This is a wonderful example of a genre that is sorely missed and can still wow them even in today's cinematic society."	4.0	Moulin Rouge Is Great - Once You Get Past The Wackiness!	2001-06-16	0	0	0

On a par with the inventive musicals of the past, &quot;Show Boat&quot;, &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot;, it was nauseating. Just when I expected some interesting dialogue the star crossed lovers sing the soft rock oldies that just hold no interest when heard on screen. Yeah, I got the part where we're led to believe that the modern day rock and roll stars are the modern day Bohemians. Oh, brother! Who hasn't heard those pretensious declarations before,  made ad naseaum by many hollywood movie stars, rock and roll personalities every day on television, radio, movies and countless magazines. It sort of pokes fun at itself but not to the extent that &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; enjoyed and certainly isn't as engaging. I hope the people who buy the soundtrack understand that they may as well have just turned on the local 70's and 80's station to hear the same songs. Too bad the producers couldn't fork over the money to create some new love songs for the show.  It sort of reminded me of a teenagers view of truth, beauty and love , along with all the antics with which teenagers involve themselves - if that was the intended audience - score.	2.0	One of the worst musicals I've ever seen.	2001-06-06	9	4	5

Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec ? Ah, please !

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2CQP1IA9CZQV5	Lauren	What an incredible movie! This film was extremely captivating. It draws you in from the beginning and drops you off rather abruptly and reluctantly when &quot;The End&quot; shows up on the screen.Need a quick overview of this Luhrmann masterpiece? Christian(McGregor), a young impressionable writer, flees to Paris against the wishes of his father, turning down his fortune to seek his Bohemian dream of love. There he meets Toulouse-Lautrec(John Leguizamo), who pulls him into a lifestyle of absinthe, Spectacular! Spectacular!, and Moulin Rouge. In the famous Parisian nightclub, he meets Satine(Kidman), a popular courtesan, whom he falls in love with. A powerful romance ensues, despite hazardous perils.Personally, I've seen this three times in the theatres and I'm still craving more of that thought-provoking picture. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; truly kidnaps all five senses and takes them for a ride, which is brought about by stunning fast-pace scenes, a simple but inviting plot, and beautiful performances by a great cast.Those scenes and that director. Baz Luhrmann never fails to impress people. Leave it to him to incorporate pop music ranging from David Bowie to Madonna in a turn of the century film! An image of an ostentatious Harold Zidler belting out Like a Virgin will forever be engraved in my mind. Also, another aspect of the film that was rather innovative and extraordinary was the mixing of scenes. We watch a passionate tango dance occuring in the Moulin Rouge at the same time as we view a rendezvous between the Duke and Satine. While both of these scenes hold enough on their own, the marriage between the two is stirring and attention grabbing. It also points out the nuisance of blinking.Though the storyline isn't anything new, creativity in other areas more than makes up for the predictability in the plot. For example, the acting in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is remarkable. I have seen several movies that star the Scottish actor Ewan McGregor, and he always offers depth, charisma and poignant portrayals. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is no exception for his impressive resume! His character, the sensitive, love-inflicted Bohemian writer Christian, is handsome, believable and devoted to the lovely yet doomed courtesan, Satine(played by the inspiring Nicole Kidman). Their love affair is naively pure and majestically brought about by the great chemistry between Kidman and McGregor. Another great actor in this film is the talented Jim Broadbent, who offers a humorous and captivating role as club's owner, Harold Zidler. His performance is truly one of the best I've witnessed this year in the cinema! He adds so many sides to his strident character that the movie would simply not be complete without him.The overflow of vivid emotion that other motion pictures miserably lack is blended with raw talent and amusing comedy to form &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. This film leaves its' audiences craving more, driving a crash course into an insane atmosphere of the uninhibited onslaught of merging sensuality with sparks, then falling into the conclusion with a dazzling array of cinematography. Luhrmann has certainly outdone himself.I've not covered even half of the great points of this amazing movie, such as Ewan McGregor's spectacular singing voice or that operatic moon. There's only one solution to this disturbing problem - go see it, and immediately! But you must be aware that this wasn't made for historical purposes, or to rival a big action blockbuster. This is, simply and purely, &quot;a story about love&quot;.	5.0	The Show Must Go On...	2001-07-19	42	35	7

Moulin Rouge is a musical that contains no more than half dozen lines outside of lyrics. The songs do carry the story of a young man (Ewan McGregor) in love with a working girl (Nicole Kidman) and the tragedy that follows.The songs are love songs taken from popular hits over the years. Lacking was the famous chorus line that Offenbach had in mind when he wrote ""Gay Parisian"" (or ""Can-Can""), as it is sometime referred.Overall the film was good and entertains well."	3.0	A Grand Musical	2012-05-10	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A19R52H50B17Y7	L. Chu	I owned this movie on DVD, but having a 110&#34; HD projector setup and 7.2 channel surround sound, the DVD version was always lacking. The DVD paled in comparison to all my other Blu Rays, and when the Moulin Rouge BD went on sale I knew I had to have this timeless musical. I won't go into detail about the movie, as there are plenty of others that have, so I will simply review the Blu Ray version.In short, the picture was obviously a big improvement, providing 1080p glory and vibrant colors that this movie so proudly presents, but the real wow factor came from the sound. The DTS HD Master Audio track on this movie is spectacular (spectacular)! Voices open up, and the stage presence greatly improves upon the DVD version. Being a dual layer 50GB disc, they spared no expense to retain as much of the sound as possible and minimize the effects of compression. The clarity and transient response was effortlessly portrayed on my modest Klipsch Reference towers, and extended frequency effects maintained a certain air and magic of the atmosphere that really transports you into this cinematic adventure.If you are a fan of Moulin Rouge and you're on the fence about buying the blu ray version, buy it!	5.0	Great picture, but even better sound!	2014-03-01	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2J0WX87P521VA	Leah Chester	"...It's a remake first of all and secondly they tell you the enitre story during the performance of spectacular spectacular! However, Baz uses this to his advantage by putting layer upon layer upon layer to transform the simplistic plot into a sensory overload. From using the exact same lines within the movie and the play within the play, to the tango paralleling the characters events, Baz uses different forms of expression to convey to the audience the emotionality and significance of what is taking place. I happend to appreciate the camera angles because every time I see this movie I catch something I didn't the first time. For example, every time Satine has a relapse the camera flashes a split second image of her death scene. I enjoy the paradox presented within Satine singing about dreams dying while in the shadow of the symbolic bird cage. I LOVE that the speech impediment inflicted Toulouse is assigned the task of saying the most important line in the entire film to which for ONCE he does not slur his speech!! I also like to recognize the things the audience doesn't think about while watching the film. For, example..the fact that Toulouse was going to be playing the part of Maria in the sound of music?!?!?!  And just the pure concept of a Narcoleptic Argentinian tango dancer!! C'mon? How can you not laugh at that?!?! I think that Richard Roxburgh does an AMAZING job at portraying the duke as a pathetic yet psychologically demeted duke that is both evil and hilarious! Talk about character development!! My conclusion is that those who find they cannot appreciate this film don't really know what they are talking about.  Yes, it is very melodramatic and over-the-top, but that Baz makes it so that EVERYTHING is over-the-top makes it work! The term ""red curtain"" means that you are ""watching a movie"". It is not suppossed to be real!! So just kick back and enjoy for cryin out loud. You have to understand that this is a musical...it is not going to be anymore reality based than an english babysitter who flies around on an umbrella and dances with penguins. As far as the music goes, I think they did a wonderful job with witty lyrical exchange. I personally would have done anything to be a part of this production. Kudos to everyone involved! I have never seen a movie in which I liked Nicole Kidman's character, but she was surprisingly amusing in this film. I had no idea she could be so funny. Of course, Ewan McGregor is beautiful and maybe I just love the movie so much because I secretly lust after him, but... The point of my boring ramblings is that this movie holds on to the Bohemian in all of us and no matter how hard we fight it, it insists that we leave believing that love above all is the answer. Everyone at some time in their life has dealt with that feeling of heartbreak and tried to flush all romantic ideals from their head. If it wasn't for movies like this, altough the theme may at times be considered naive, people might forget that it's okay to let go of all the world's sorrow and misfortune and dream a little. I used to think that people with their head in clouds were childish and naive. But if there is one thing to be learned from this film, it's that having the courage to hold on to your dreams and believe in love with all your heart is truly a wonderous and beautiful thing; that which people should encourage in each other, rather than scorn."	5.0	Bad Critics: Lighten you attitudes and your heels!	2001-07-27	0	0	0

I didn't see this movie until it came out on DVD...  while it was at the theater I kept saying it didn't look like my kind of movie.  For some reason - a whim, I guess - I decided to buy the DVD... I watched it twice in a row that night.  I fell in love with this movie... The music, the acting, the scenary, the costumes, everything...  I watched it about four more times that weekend.  It's become one of my absolute faves.  Never have I felt such awe while watching a movie.When I told my best friend about it, her immediate reaction was.. &quot;No no, not my kind of movie.&quot;  I just grinned and told her that's exactly what I thought too before I watched it.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3I58MXZL8PSRG	Leland R. Somers	This film couldn't decide whether it was high camp or just second rate imitation of a number of good movies.  It was derivative beginning with Cabaret (one of the best movies ever made).  The music was utterly unoriginal and obviously the person who put the score together thought that the film was going to be set in 1999  not 1899. Frankly I couldn't watch it all the way to the ... end, it became far too painful to handle ....	1.0	One of the worst movies I have ever seen	2002-04-17	12	7	5
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2MHFG4UUX945A	"""lemontree97"""	I will strongly recommend to all people to watch this fantastic musical. I love it not because of the cast or the director but the songs and the way she was expressed. the first 30 to 45 mins were energetic, almost noisy, but it didn't detory the original melodies.I have a friend said that the photography is worse in Tango, he wanted to watch the whole figure of the dancers but not their heads. Hullo! The film is from a &quot;VISIONARY&quot; director, you shoud know that it must not filmed regulary, as a musical on the stage. If you didn't like it, don't watch it then.All of all it is the most marvelous musical I have ever watch! Get it !	5.0	Fantastic Musical I have ever seen!	2002-04-18	1	0	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3W2H9SZ7MJFKE	Leslie Brown	I havent seen this movie since it was in theatres, and since, i have been waiting impatiently for the video. When i did see it, i found the photography to be excellent; there was so much vivid color and changes in the types of photgraphy used. The music (although not orginal) was used very well in the movie, and had been recreated to fit well with the story. What i liked best was the fact that the main characters actually sang in their own voices, instead of lip-syncing the entire thing. Nicole and Ewan have wonderful singing voices-they should use them more often. By the end of the movie, all my senses were in overload... it is an excellent movie, but it does make you a bit dizzy by the end!	4.0	Music for the senses	2001-12-15	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A389E6MJWHOJKO	Liesl Calado	I had heard that one would either love or hate this movie, but in my case, I'm right in the middle; I would actually give this 2 1/2 stars if I could. I loved the musical numbers; I was afraid that the modern songs wouldn't mesh with a 'period piece', but I was pleasantly surprised. I will never hear 'Like a Virgin' or 'Roxanne' in the same way ever again! I also thought the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan take-off was hilarious. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman gave incredible performances.On the negative side, the last half of the movie is way too slow considering the frenetic pace of the first half. We all know the ending from the very beginning, so why drag it out? Major editing should have been done, in my opinion. Also, although I am a big romantic, I disliked being force-fed the love theme. The &quot;the greatest thing you'll ever learn...&quot; line was repeated too many times, so the end of the movie just left a bad taste in my mouth.Overall, I'd watch it again only if I could fast-forward from song to song. This isn't a great movie, but an eclectic and opulent music video.	2.0	Music is its greatest strength	2001-07-05	2	2	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ADJTYIJGHKDZQ	Lil' CaT	I am so happy that I watched this movie, when it first came out I never wanted to go see it because it just looked boring.  But recently I went to rent the video and found out that that was the biggest mistake I had made.  It's fantastic! I had never really been a fan of Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor, but this movie totally just changed my view towards them both.Now I am a total Ewan fan and am really happy to discover this.  I find him totally suitable for his character, very charming in doing his part and I love his voice, there are not many actors out there that can act well, AND sing well, but there's Ewan.  The story although is not original and the songs also but It blended together perfectly, Your Song, Come What May are my personal favorites, I'm always rewinding back just to listen to the songs and now I got them both on computer! I would totally recommand this film to those who have not seen it.	5.0	Totally was not what I expected	2002-07-03	2	2	0

Both actors show their strength and vulnerability within their characters and give us a real love story.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	"Filmed in Australia, but set in Paris in 1899, this 2001 musical stars Nicole Kidman as Satine, a beautiful courtesan who is in love with a penniless writer played by Ewan McGreggor. However, a jealous duke wants Satine for his own.  Complications follow in this extremely stylized musical extravaganza that combines original music with familiar songs from the seventies in an outlandish fantasy of color and sound.  It reminded me a bit of The Rocky Horror Picture show and Can Can and La Boheme, all rolled into one.  Parts of it play like a music video with extra quick cuts and the characters all larger than life and caricatures of themselves.  At first I hated it.  The story seemed silly, the acting overdone, and the special effects distracting.  It all seemed discordant, the sets too full of glitz and glitter and the makeup too outrageous. At this point, I nearly shut off the video and went back to reading a book.However, as the film rolled on, I got into it.  The acting was excellent and Nicole Kidman somehow emerged beyond her stereotype.  I found myself rooting for the good guys and felt sympathy for the ill-fated lovers.  I hummed the familiar tunes such as ""The Hills are Alive with the Sound of Music,"" ""Nature Boy,"" ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend,"" ""Material Girl"", ""All You Need is Love,"" ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" and ""Like a Virgin.""  And I enjoyed their staging in their new and fresh presentations.  I sat there fascinated and just simply let myself enjoy.  Then I realized that, as a whole, Moulin Rouge works.  It's not real, and it's not supposed to be.  It's just a big fun musical romp.I know I would have enjoyed it more on a big screen or even on a DVD however.  Video just doesn't do it justice.  But do see it if you can.  It's pure entertainment.  So just sit back and enjoy!"	5.0	It's not real.  It's not supposed to be.  Its just pure fun!	2002-04-20	3	3	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1MNS8X8VMI770	"Linda Rawlings ""Goddess"""	I must admit, the first 40 minutes or so left me wondering whether this whole film was a joke, it had too much silly, eccagerated acting and humor, mixed with deepfelt, romantic scenes..very confusing. Some people got up and left the theatre at this point. How very sad for them! Because WOW..suddenly the whole movie shifted into drama, love and passion, and the very first love song scene melted my heart. Ewan and Nicole CAN sing! And when they act it seems so real, you just sit there with a silly grin on your face and go &quot; aaawww&quot;. From then on, the movie picks up pace both in plot, intensity and beauty. Some songs were written originally for this movie, and they are unforgettable. Most of the musical intermezzos were playing on or flat out making fun of other songs, like Madonna's &quot;Like a virgin&quot;. You will have to atch it to see how they managed to put this all together to a whole. The costumes, the ambiance, the filning, it was all unique, like nothing I have ever seen before. That alone is amazing. I highly recommend this shw to anyone willing to put up with a silly beginning, it is so worth it in the end! My daughter and I struggled hard not to sob out loud the last 40 minutes, and I never cry at movies! This musical is simply impossible to stick in a box and shrug at, it slipped past all my defences and cynicism and I found myself actually experiencing overwhelming emotions in response to Ewan's huge, blue eyes and Nicole's dramatic passion.	5.0	Breath-taking, unique and silly musical	2001-06-09	0	0	0

The soundtrack is very catchy - I downloaded all the songs after watching - and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have spectacular voices.  I've heard that people will either love or hate this movie, and I certainly felt the former.

As the former, I have no interest whatsoever discussing this movie as a spiritual experience or a deep love story. It is the world's greatest nightmare of MTV American style fable. I cannot believe Ewan did this film, in fact. Love is a construct. It is a contract based on social needs and norms and nothing else. Maybe in Tibet or with doped up people in Los Angeles or New York this movie could have appeal. Not with more sophisticated cultures such as the ones one finds in London and Paris.	1.0	Historically Inaccurate	2005-03-03	17	10	7
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2RHV42BTJSVON	"Liolania ""In2Jesus"""	This movie is not for everyone,not everyone will like it. I know I didn&#8217;t&#8230;. I LOVED IT!!!! It was a wonderfull combination of a love story and musical. There is certianly no movie like it before it!!!  The best musical I&#8217;ve ever seen before. With interesting camera work. Interesting remakes of song esp. the re-singing of Madonna&#8217;s &#8220;Like a Virgin&#8221; it is hilarious!!! This movie is not only truly funny, but a moving tale of a hooker and a poor Englishman(Ewan McGregor) who moves to france in hopes of producing musicals.  Then he meets Satine(Nicole Kidman)who he immediately falls in love with. Bad choice for a lover in my opinion, but it only adds to the thick and wild tale. The thing I love most about it is how Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman display true emotions that you really feel. Not only in just the acting, but in the music. It almost brings me to tears thinking of  Ewan singing to Nicole on the roof of her elephant shaped house. When you see it you&#8217;ll know. Its amazing.  To sum things up if you are looking for something different, a powerfull love story, a unique film, something hilarious yet serious, or just something amazing see this movie. But see it with an open mind. But remember this movie is not for everyone.  HOPE you love the film as much as I did I can&#8217;t wait to see it again!!!...	5.0	Moulin Rouge Review:	2001-06-20	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1TDDM47OJQ3KL	"Lisa McKinley ""lisa_in_so_cal"""	"Because of the hype surrounding this film at the time of its release, I avoided it and everything associated with it - - hearing ""Lady Marmalade"" played over and over caused me to stop listening to the radio that summer.  Still, I added 'Moulin Rouge' to my wish list and received it last Christmas.  Not wanting to appear overly anxious, I'm not quite sure to whom, I waited a few months before I actually viewed it.  I really didn't expect to like it, since I'm not a huge fan of musicals.Wow.After just a few minutes, I was charmed.  I loosened up.  I recognized the songs.  Songs from my youth were in a musical!  I knew the words!  Honestly, the story is silly, it's a very straightforward, formulaic boy-meets-girl-but-they-can't-be-together-for-whatever-reason story.  But Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are so magnetic together, I found myself enamored with the whole plot-line.  John Leguizamo is fantastic as Toulouse Lautrec.  All the characters are over-the-top.  It's like a freakshow/circus, visually exciting, but kind of weird at the same time.  And if you listen carefully, you'll recognize songs or lyrics from Elton John, the Beatles, Nirvana, David Bowie...it's so much fun!  I would never compare it to classic musicals, such as 'Singin' in the Rain', but Moulin Rouge' will find its place.  I haven't seen 'Chicago' yet, so I can't compare, but for what it is, 'Moulin Rouge' is fun, and satisfies that occasional need for sappiness we women crave once in a while.  Just to hear the line - -  The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return - - it just makes your heart melt!So, if you don't want to think too much, if you don't mind stepping away from reality for a while, if you're willing to partake in a visual and aural feast, just strap yourself in to the extravaganza that is Baz Lurhmann's 'Moulin Rouge'...it really is spectacular, spectacular!"	5.0	Sappy, Cliche-ridden, Simple...but Undeniably Delightful!	2003-09-05	2	2	0

The DTS soundtrack is amazing. I am thrilled to finally have this on blu ray.My only complaint is about the extras. There is a lot of good stuff here, but many of my favorite extras from the 2 disc DVD set are missing - the multi angle extended dance numbers, the dance rehearsal footage and some of the best deleted/alternate scenes. The dance rehearsals in particular are a loss because you can see the full choreography for the Can Can, Like A Virgin and the Hindi dance, much of which was cut or not shown in the film. It's really fun to watch and a shame it's not included.The rare footage that is included is presented in a small window with a decorative border. This is very annoying and distracting. I would much rather see it full screen, even if it is lower resolution.Overall I still strongly recommend this disc for the gorgeous presentation of the film itself. Just be aware that some of the best extras are not included, so hang onto your 2 disc DVD set, or seek out a used copy.	4.0	Great movie and blu ray, but missing lots of good extras	2010-10-21	12	11	1

Ewan goes to the show to pitch his show that he has done with his friends and gets mistaken as The Duke.

Some people have called this a terrible movie, but I think it was wonderful, if you attack it with the right mindset.  This is a fun, romantic movie.  The music is done in an excellent manner - while the movie is set in the early 1900's, music from the 1970's to the present is used. And how it is used is the best part - whoever had the work of tying the songs together did a remarkable job.  Elton John's Your Song is the first part of the love songs, and it made me cry the first time I saw it!  That was always a favorite of mine, but the way it was woven into the story, and sung by Ewan and Nicole is simply breathtaking!  The Elephant Medley is awesome - taking a half dozen songs or so and making a fun, romantic, playful time for Ewan and Nicole, bounding around the top of a house shaped like a giant elephant (told you it wasn't supposed to be serious!) - it made me laugh and cry at the same time.  Watch the movie - you may or may not like it, but watch it to have a good time, and you'll be pleased with the results.  Don't watch if you are expecting a serious romance, or typical comedy.  Remember when Tommy first hit as a movie?  People had a hard time understanding it as well; it could only be enjoyed in the right frame of mind.  This is much, MUCH better, but you need the right attitude to enjoy it best.	4.0	A lot more fun than serious!	2002-03-11	2	1	1

NO!  It was genius to say the least.This movie is over the top in every single way...and I think you really need to have that mindset to begin with to appreciate it.I loved it...I was glued to the screen the entire time..marvelling at the effects, the costumes, the music...it made me cry, and that says it all.Put your realism aside and absorb the beauty of this movie.	5.0	Excellent..not for the Morons	2002-03-24	0	0	0

And that's what it is. Something special.The plot is essentialy this: A British poet moves to France and finds himself in a position to write a play for the Moulin Rouge. Soon thereafter, he falls in love with one of its stars, Satine. But the play and the Moulin Rouge will not go on unless a certain Duke invests his money into it. The catch? The Duke is also in love with Satine and doesn't know about the secret love affair between the poet and Satine. Mayhem, chaos, tears and betrayal ensue.A surprisingly potent love story is placed inside a red-hot bottle of music, dance, colors and vibrancy, and splashed across your movie screen with love as its foundation. Will everyone like it? Certainly not, the film has a certain over-stylized energy about it which may not sit well with everyone (I personally enjoyed most of the film's unique camera trickery, but did get lost in its frenzy from time to time), but anyone who loves musicals is sure to at least appreciate Mr. Luhrmann's bold approach to reviving this lost genre of films. The first half an hour of the movie is especially strange, and many may think ""What the Hell am I doing here?""? But the movie soon reveals itself to be beautiful, powerful and intoxicating in its own way.If Nicole Kidman is not at least nominated for an Oscar for her stunning performance in this movie, there is no justice in thsi world. She invests in all emotions, making the audience really empathise with her character, devliering catchy, upbeat and sometimes moving remakes of pop songs with apparent ease. However, Ewan McGregor's moving performance as the infatuated lover is not to be forgotten, and his voice is surprisingly strong. Perhaps we'll be seeing him in the charts sometime soon?Make magic.

Instead, it is a rather dull, failed attempt.  Perhaps the best example of what makes this movie a poor one is the ridiculous plot device in which the singing and dancing Nicole Kidman has tuberculosis.  The problem here is that she is on the verge of death - you find this out at the end - yet somehow, she is able to belt out tremendous musical numbers and dance in several sequences throughout the movie that would wear an average person out.  Yet, as any numbskull knows, this would be rather impossible for someone who was on the verge of dying from tuberculosis.  This is just one example of how Moulin Rouge attempts to be a great movie, but ultimately fails.  If you like musicals then I would recommend that you rent this, as it has some interesting use of modern songs in a setting 100 years ago (although my heart broke when ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" was butchered at the opening).  However, I would definitely not recommend buying this movie."	2.0	Trying, but failing, to be a great movie	2002-04-24	4	3	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ADVG53CA4FTWI	Macauley86	"I did not want to see this movie to begin with. I was not inspired by the story, the setting, the concept, the message, and Nicole Kidman. But my brother rebuked me, saying that I was being to uptight about it, and that a friend of his had recommended it to him. So we watched it. After an hour, we looked at each other and agreed that the movie was really bad, boring, and meaningless; so, we stopped the vcr and that was the end of it.The movie was even worse than I expected. Let me put it this way. I hate the Bohemian Paris of those times. I hate the immoral and decadent way of life celebrated in this movie. I hate the very idea of a place like the Moulin Rouge. I hate that mixture of Epicurean, Materialist, Humanistic, and Existentialist approach to life that the European devotees of Bacchus and Eros had and still have. So, this flick already started on the wrong foot. Then, the plot was super clich&eacute;d. I know, I'm the first one who says that all movies are clich&eacute;d, but that does not bother me at all if the plot is well constructed and the actors make their characters believable and interesting. In this movie, I could not care less of the fate of the characters. Ewan McGregor would chew out the same old trite concept of love being this ecstatic feeling that consumes you and bla bla... and Nicole Kidman was supposed to fall for this guy based on the aforementioned bright discovery of the meaning and nature of love. Please, spare me. I mean, talk about a plot drowning in total idiocy and misunderstanding of the concept of love.Also, the soundtrack was a patchwork of mainstream pop and rock songs that would appeal to my deaf father and few other people with auditory disabilities. And don't even get me started on the direction. The way Lurhmann edited the whole thing wanted to appear sophisticated; well, it did not impress me at all. It was kind of like the direction of ""Strictly Ballroom,"" which, in fact,, was the only aspect in that movie that bothered me.In conclusion, some said this is a Love It or Hate It movie. I respect everybody's taste, but, as for me, I hated this movie with a passion."	1.0	Epicurean-Existentialist-Humanistic Decadent Garbage	2002-07-28	17	6	11

Personally speaking, I loved Moulin Rouge the first time I saw it, and have seen it several times since then... It provides comedy, drama, and one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen...One of the biggest complaints I've heard is that it's just too *busy*, particularly in the opening dance scene at the Moulin Rouge.  Believe me, I agree that scene was frenzied, but get through it if you can.The long and short of it is, this is either a movie that you really like or you really don't...

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A17NVM7IAPF2NS	Maek	"...I honestly didn't feel that the film contained the amount of depth that it could have held quite easily.Ewan McGregor is brilliant in his role as Christian whose idyllic outlook is bombarded by the excess and debauchery of the outside world.  His innocent demeanour is captured wonderfully in each screen shot; especially in one scene where he mistakes sexual overtones for serious conversation.  He puts a lot of heartfelt longing into every scene and his singing talent is astounding to say the least and Nicole Kidman is a fairly good vocalist as well.But it ends there, sadly.  Art is substituted by frenetic editing and the sense of being ""overwhelmed"" is not so much about what is encapsulated in an image during a scene, but the limited time that you have to see it.  Chaotic?  Ok, I sensed that...over and over and over until I felt like speaking up by shouting, ""All right, I get it.  Please move on.""  The scene involving the Duke's realization behind the musical farce mirroring his own experience was so weakly reminiscent of a similar scene in Hamlet--though unintentional--that it made me wonder if there was much in the way of ORIGINAL thought in this film.  Okay, admittedly the use of modern pop music as dialogue in this film is clever, but it was written by others!  I can sit in a library and pull out 100 unrelated books, pull out quotes, and make a movie by stringing these quotes along in a maddening, dizzying spiral of unrelated sentiment.  Some may think that's unfair, but it's TRUE.All the other characters in the film were grotesque to the point that it's no wonder that Satine and Christian appear to be perfectly normal people.  It's like holding gold up next to mud, really; and another example where excess can feel like a hammer to the face as opposed to the ""subtlety"" that others imply or state in other reviews.However, 3 stars...given the film's flaws, it still remains in its own right a very different film.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1SYLII0808HD6	M. Allen Greenbaum	"What a frustrating movie! This may be remembered as the film that hastened the return of musicals, and it features dazzling costumes, sumptuous colors, and imaginative film techniques, but there are so many problems that I came away feeling cheated.It was a creative and daring idea to set a musical in 1900 Montmartre's famed ""Moulin Rouge"" using contemporary music of the late 20th century. Unfortunately, the film is seriously undermined by the lack of plot development, a contrived romance, and the have-it-both-ways mocking and celebratory treatment of the ""Bohemian.""  The movie alternates between a tongue-in-cheek farce and a serious declaration of the importance of love and other ideals. When the company performs Madonna's ""Material Girl"" or ""Like a Virgin,"" it plays wonderfully as camp (except for the Duke's ridiculous mugging in the latter song). However, only Jim Broadbent as the master of ceremonies and manager of the nightclub consistently understands the difference between witty camp and lowbrow, diluted, burlesque.The movie's very promising opening has Toulouse-Lautrec and Satie writing an absurd, avant-garde play, but their original idea for ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" is co-opted by the financier, the Duke (a buffoonish caricature who is simply too broadly loutish to believe). And yet, Toulouse-Lautrec and Satie still seem to love the production as much as the one they had originally planned. It would have been intelligent and fun to satirize the commercialism of the eventual play, but that opportunity is never taken. Musical tastes will differ, of course, but as the two lovers exchange snippets of love songs of the last 30 or so years, it feels like the pending CD was in mind. The songs that fit best (e.g., ""Nature Boy"") are repeated ad nauseum. OK, we get it! Kidman and McGregor are excellent given the material (although their characters' romance seems contrived). Both sing well, though Kidman, who often sounds too amped up, is best when singing softer, more intimate songs.The art direction and sets are beautiful, and there's a luminescent caricature of Montmartre that recalls ""Babe, Pig in the City."" Techniques reminiscent of early photography and silent movies are superbly done, but limited mostly to the beginning. There are also redundant shots of our woeful hero and the Paris skyline, and so much forced glitter and dazzle that it's like an overdose of the Disney electric parade. Conversely, the cuts are sometimes too quick; one yearns to bathe in more atmosphere. The moments of magic and beauty are too often offset by a banal plot, as well as hollow, self-congratulatory celebrations of freedom, truth, and love. As Satine declares, ""diamonds are a girl's best friend,"" but it feels like box office receipts have the upper hand here."	3.0	3 1/2* The Spirit is Willing, but the Script is Weak	2003-02-25	16	14	2

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2P7ETJ32FE4FT	Mandie Kok	When watching this movie for the first time, it is advisable to wear a seat belt.  It is so fast-moving and thrilling and confusing that it results in sensory overload.  Which is, of course, fantastic -  if that is the kind of thing that excites you.The film is edited in such a way that you can hardly focus on a scene before it changes.  It sets off at a rapid pace, but soon slows down into a hugely entertaining, funny and endearing romance.  The plot is quite simple - it has to be if the audience is to keep up!  Boy meets girl, boy can't have girl, boy gets girl anyway and...Luhrman's love of the Shakesperean tragic ending shines through.Of course, it IS a musical, so if you don't like people breaking out into song and dance, don't watch it.  The fun part is, you should know most of the songs already, so you can feel all clever when you figure out what song they are about to start singing.The DVD is wonderful, so many extras that you will be entertained for hours.  There are even hidden clips in the stills, so look out for them.  I thouroughly enjoyed and continue to enjoy owning this DVD.After repeated viewings, you will be able to adjust to the rapid pace and spot things that you missed at first glance.  In fact, the more I watched this film, the more gratifying it became, because upon first viewing, you are just shocked at the COLOUR!

But I did, and I'm gladly surprised: the things that ignorance can trick you into thinking... This movie is directed by Baz Luhrmann, the same genius behind the extravagant-yet-amazing version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; starring Leonardo Di Caprio a few years ago.Now, on a similar note, he brings this wonderful work starring Scottish Ewan McGregor and gorgeous Nicole Kidman in front of a production that could be compared to Broadway musicals, while retaining a special life of its own, with an abundant sense of humor (take the blend of lyrics of highly-known pop songs into the most unpexected dramatic situations and the Argentinian that falls asleep everywhere, for instance) and some visuals that will leave you astounded. Unconventional as it is, the movie explores a genre that might as well only belong to Luhrmann forever, but the matter of the fact is that it accomplishes its goal in storytelling while resulting highly entertaining and filled with some very good acting, specially by McGregor.	5.0	Gladly surprised	2002-01-12	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3E5VKPVU8LAIT	Manolis Vozalis	This is the movie where you can find music from such diverse artists like Madonna (in a rather comic performance of &quot;Like a virgin&quot;), Queen (&quot;Show must go on&quot;), Police (a dazzling tango version of &quot;Roxanne&quot;), The Beatles (a brief mention to &quot;All you need is love&quot;) and even... Nirvana (in a surprising version of &quot;Smells like teen spirit&quot; with slightly altered lyrics).The plot is as simple as it gets: A young and talented bohemian writer (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with Satin (Nicole Kidman), a dance hall girl who dreams of becoming a real actress. The bad guy of the plot, a.k.a. the Duke (Richard Boxburgh), is willing to realize her dreams, but only if he can win or buy her love.I have to admit it: I am not a big fan of musicals and therefore not sure if I'd enjoy the movie. But Moulin Rouge is a motion picture that requests your full attention, and if you choose to give it, then you are in for a thrilling ride.I was rather surprised with the fact that the director (Buz Luhrmann) was not nominated for an Oscar. Ok, the cinematography and the costumes surely deserve the acknowledgement, but such an extravagant spectacle could easily have gotten out of control, if not in the hands of a skilled director.In any case, enjoy the surprisingly expressive voice of Ewan McGregor, the comic touch that Nicole Kidman instills in her part, the so fitting over the top performances of the supporting cast. But at the end, just close your eyes and forget about the vivid colors and loud music, because Moulin Rouge is above all a powerful love story.	5.0	Spectacular Spectacular!	2002-03-25	8	7	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2ULSA0IRUE09E	Marc Cabir Davis	And it ends right here. Without question, the DVD edition of 'Moulin Rouge' is by far the best-produced DVD of the year. Its obvious that the people making this disc were lovers of the film. Every scene sparkles with digital mastering that we've only thus far dreamt of, and the soundtrack is a hundred times better than the ones we've come to expect of DVDs in recent times. If you already own the soundtrack, the songs take on new life on this disc. This is a sinful delight if there ever was one.Alright, so by this time you probably know the story. This review is to focus on the quality of the DVD and its' content. To be fair, the DVD for 'Moulin Rouge' could well be compared to one that was released earlier in the year - 'The Sound of Music'. Like that film, this is a double disc set, and like that film, it has extras all around. The only distinct difference is that the film quality here is markedly better (natural, since 'Moulin Rouge' is a product of the 2000s). It is heartening to note that despite the loads of trite and useless titles published by the studios each week, there are still a few worth buying and not merely renting. This DVD is one of them. Get it now. Emphasis on all three words, my dears.Fans of the movie will be pleased to note that the makers of this product have given due respect to the word 'extras'. First of all, I must bring to your attention that this is the Widescreen version of the film, and NOT the standard version as was originally advertised on DVD talk forums early on. There is no standard full screen mode here, so if thats a problem for you, don't get it. However, for those of us who have no problem with widescreen and the two black bars on the top and bottom, this is a purchase well worth investing in. The film is close-captioned, by the way. And it has Dolby Surround Sound.Disc One : Aside from the entire film, this disc also has a commentary by Baz Luhrmann, Catherine Martin, and Don McAlpine. I dont know if any of you have seen the Bravo TV Special on the movie, but it seems that these bits featured on that show as well. For some reason, watching Baz talk is not as interesting as I thought it would be.Disc One also has writing commentary by Baz Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, and 8 behind the scenes branches. An interesting note here : most of you who buy this DVD will realize that the whenever the musical pieces come on, the sound quality automatically betters itself - could it be that the spoken portions are actually in mono? I don't think so, but you decide for yourself. Since the songs were all prerecorded in a studio, their quality differs from the dialogue portion, leading to some interesting results. It takes a while getting used to. Musical numbers to watch out for are Nicole Kidman doing a Marilyn Monroe/Madonna take with 'Diamonds are a girls best friend', and the poignant duet 'Come what may'. However, the song I most liked (and its not on the soundtrack) was the version of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' sung by a chorus of fat old balding men. Incredible, but it works.Disc Two : I don't know what they did with the Bravo TV Special which was infinitely better than the HBO documentary. In any case, we get The Making of Moulin Rouge HBO Special in all its glory here. Gosh, Nicole looks really pasty.The second disc also has 5 &quot;Star&quot; featurettes, Earlier drafts of screenplay (this is not as exciting as you'd think it would be, believe me), 6 extended scenes &amp; 4 re-cut dance sequences (this is the BIGGEST BOON for all us fans of the film. To our delight, it includes the MUCH-LOVED version of 'Spectacular, Spectacular'). There is also an interview with John &quot;Cha Cha&quot; O'Connell and Caroline O'Connor.There are also a few 'Easter Eggs' : hidden clues and little baubles that take you to the special parts of the DVD. Unfortunately, this disc is also very heavily dependent on DVD-ROM, which means that you cant access much stuff through your basic DVD player. The last thing I wanted to see were screens that said 'Insert disc into DVD-ROM drive'. But oh well, the disc on the whole is great.On a more dismal note, the second DVD also includes the music video for 'Lady Marmalade' by Christina Aguilera, Mya, Pink, and L'il Kim. I don't know if this is a good thing, but its there, just in case. Sound quality is absolutely fabulous throughout.All in all, a fabulous attempt to put one of the year's best films onto digital disc. The only thing I was upset about is that my favorite song off the soundtrack 'Complainte.' by Rufus Wainwright is not featured prominently.On a side note, the making of featurette also introduces us to Kylie Minogue, the UK's biggest singing star, who plays the Green Fairy (shes adorable). There is a sequence where she sings 'The Sound of Music'. You may want to replay that one for a while.Come to think of it, you may want to sit through both discs more than once. The jury is out, well, to me at least, 'Moulin Rouge' is a desert island DVD, one that you can't do without. And if you like this one, do keep an eye out for 'The Princess and the Warrior' and 'The Children of Paradise' releasing on DVD in January 2002.Highly, highly recommended.	5.0	The Quest for the Perfect DVD	2001-12-20	9	8	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2DJ8EU59M64DB	Marco Albini	"Moulin Rouge tells the story of penyless writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) who falls for the Moulin Rouge cortisane Satine (Nicole Kidman). But Satine has to be bound to the Duke in order to keep the Moulin rouge an his owner Zidler from bankrupcy. And to complicate things, Satine is slowly dying of an incurable disease.The first 45 minutes of the movie i found myself amazed by the spectacle, the superonic pace, the surealism. It made me forget the bad jokes and the weak story, which has been told a thousand times. So now that my eyes got used to the viusal style of Baz Luhrman they got tired. The movie reched his lowpoint with an awful Madonna cover and became overloaded and annoying.  The songs ween't that great in general but I still liked the idea of an overblown musical. But little would have been more and the theatrical acting and the continuous ""look what we can do"" killed this movie from being interesting as a whole.The quality of the DVD is amazing and the special features are interesting and I have great respect for Mr. Luhrmans creativity. I just hope that he won't keep repeating himself and won't be affraid to do something compelling without pomp and glamour.""Moulin Rouge"" was definately worth seeing but couldn't grab my attention from start to finish for its artifficial hipness and lack of depth."	3.0	Neither loved n'or hated Moulin Rouge..	2002-05-07	1	1	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A31G9W7WS16DEA	"""maremare101"""	If you like musicals, songs you can sing along to, romantic stories, or stories that leave you with a smile and tear, you'll LOVE Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge!Moulin Rouge is set in France in 1899. It's the tragic story of a spontaneous love affair between a young, idealist writer named Christian and a jaded showgirl named Satine. All goes well until the Moulin Rouge becomes dependent on an evil Duke, who just happens to wants Satine all for himself.This is a love-it or hate-it kind of movie. With remakes of songs from artists like Elton John, the soundtrack is a truly dazzling entity in and of itself (BUY IT!!) However, with songs about every five minutes, it's hard for people with short attention spans to fully appreciate the little nuances in the songs and in Ewan's great smile. But if you're a showgirl at heart, or if you truly believe in Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and Love, you'll LOVE this movie!	5.0	A Bohemian Treasure	2002-01-15	2	1	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1LDX2GHDJRA8U	Marianne	What can a person say to describe Moulin Rouge? I have heard many hardened critics say they were &quot;blown away&quot;, or that the Spectacular cinema spectacle was the best movie of the year. The acting is top class, with Nicole Kidman, Ewan MacGregor and Jim Broadbent particulary impressive but, with this impressive movie to fall back on it would have been easy for the DVD to have been released with minimal fuss and effort, as if any a movie could sell itself this would have been it. But, as seems to be the case with him, director Baz Lurhman didn't feel content to merely release the film by it's own, so he came up with a 2 disc DVD extravaganza!The first DVD features the film, as well as the commentaries and other hidden features but the second disk is filled with nearly 2 hours of additional footage including an impressive making of the movie, interviews with the stars, trailers, music videos, cut scenes, extended dances with multi-angle viewing capability, early script drafts as well as photo galleries and a whole host of other extras. This DVD is by far one of the best I have seen and I would honestly reccomend this to anyone: to put it simply; no DVD collection will be complete without this modern classic in it.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3211IGL56WLBK	Marie Beech	Absolutely love this movie. I definitely think this is one of the movies that you either love or hate. I've never met someone who was in between. It's definitely a chick flick, in my opinion. It is very cliche in a lot of things as well but that doesn't take away from the movie. I can watch this movie over and over and still enjoy it - in fact I've probably watched this well over a hundred times. Some of the songs are kinda of ehh (I don't like the beginning of the Smells like Teen Spirit part and the Like a Virgin one isn't that thrilling either) but others are really amazing. It's definitely a movie about beauty, truth, freedom and above all things LOVE!	5.0	Moulin Rouge (Widescreen Edition)	2014-01-02	1	1	0

I bought the DVD, and they were right. I'm beginning to think i'm obsessed with this movie.Because i watch it so many times. And the more i watch, the more i like the movie. I keep thinking about it.

I'm already having withdrawl symptoms after seeing it more times than I care to say - and will see it as many times as I can as long as it is in the theaters!!What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?  It is an amazing, fantastic, spectacular roller coaster ride of emotions that will leave you breathless and running back for more.  Moulin Rouge IS unlike any movie you have ever been to, but more than that is an EXPERIENCE.  You cannot just watch this film and appreciate all the varied aspects - its something you have to FEEL.  Unfortunately, there are those who just don't get it and I feel sad for them because of what they are missing.Thank you, thank you to all the cast &amp; crew, but especially Baz who is a pure genius!!  Also to Nicole and Ewan (who is such a cutie you'll fall in love!).  They put their hearts &amp; souls into this movie and it shows.  It is a Spectacular spectacle of color, music, truth, beauty, freedom - and above all things - LOVE!  Love is like oxygen, love is a many splendored thing, all you need is LOVE!  Okay, I'm getting carried away.Be sure to get the CD - it will hold you over between theater visits - and until the DVD/Video comes out! (Now I have to go &amp; buy a DVD player!!)

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AEZL2HD2UPUBW	Marina Golodnikova	Yes, when I firstly was going to see Moulin Rouge I was quite sceptical - ok, I'll watch it, but only because I watch every movie this theatre shows. The first 15 minutes I was stunned - so much of colors, noise, moving... People, help!!!!! Where AM I???? were my thoughts... But...Well, it went further and further, and I was more and more stunned, this time with excitement. Ewan McGregor has a really unusual voice, very beautiful. Nicole not so strong, but also very cute. Just fits the moments. I can tell that I cried with delightment. This is the best movie I've ever saw. The plot is pretty simple of course, but I think the simplest is the most beautiful. But the only thing. Firstly you have to see it in ONLY the cinema. Because my mum saw it only on video, and she didn't like it as much as me. You can't get that feeling of everything surrounds you;-)	5.0	The best movie you'll ever see	2002-01-02	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3033Y0GF8QDC1	Mark Borchers	....a chick flick in the most negative sense of the term.  It uses a shallow plot (that's baby-pool-shallow, folks) as the infrastructure to carry out the murder of an array of classic rock and roll songs, songs which clash jarringly with the prewar-Paris setting of this musical.  The film appears to be intended as a sensory feast, both visually and aurally.  For me, the musical aspect simply does not work, although I know many people who really enjoyed the soundtrack.  The visual bombardment is technically well-done, and if you like frenetic and gawdy light and color superimposed on a Paris cabaret movie set which NEVER attempts to convince you that it is anything more real than a set on a sound stage, then you may well find the movie an exciting and stimulating experience.  Fans of maudlin filmmaking will enjoy the climactic tragedy of the affair between the poor young musical poet and the courtesan whose armored heart is finally breached by love, an affair that is doomed to end amidst a flood of tears gushing out from beneath the pancake makeup of the cabaret cast of the Moulin Rouge.  Heck, I don't know, maybe this movie is really somewhat faithful to the Bohemian pseudo-life of Paris nightclubs back in the day.  I sure did not like it much, though.	2.0	Moulin Rouge is.....	2003-02-23	4	2	2

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2DNIRKC2VF7O8	Mark E. Haas	MOULIN ROUGE, although it has apparently, though oddly, regenerated an interest in the full-blown &quot;Hollywood musical&quot; left me totally cold. I found it a bloated, incomprehensible mish-mash of cheap cinematic tricks, with little or no substance, relying on the use of pre-existing musical numbers, erratically staged, and performances obviosuly coaxed from actors who cared little about their roles or the project. Visually tiring, with its peculiar editing, it was a total chore to sit through. Thank goodness Miramax ignored this dismal effort and took the plunge to make CHICAGO, which is infinately a much better film musical. If &quot;the musical&quot; does indeed return to Hollywood and once again becomes acceptable and accessible to the movie-going public, it will be because of CHICAGO, not the trite and over-the-top MOULIN ROUGE.	2.0	Moulin Misses the Mark	2003-08-27	8	5	3

I respect him for his ambitiousness and I encourage him to keep up with such attempts for the successes are surely worth it.In my opinion, the film failed in several respects. Foremost, I don't think there is any character development. What fuels Satine's ambition?  How can Zidler be so cold and greedy?  Louie and that gang, they only appear when it's convenient for the unbelievably weak plot.  The life in the club is not developed well either.  Basically, I didn't get a chance to know the characters or the ""bohemian life"" well enough to feel anything for them.The musical aspect of the movie did not seem to work either. To me, this really muddled what Director Luhrman was aiming for.  What is the significance of using take-offs of 80's hits?  Is this supposed to be some satirical social commentary?There is a shallowness and ambiguousness throughout the movie.  Thus, although I wanted to like Satine and Christian, all I could muster was a sense of triteness."	1.0	Garish. No substance.	2002-01-22	12	5	7

I was in shock. I don't know what I expected but it certainly wasn't what I got. I was in a sensory daze blown away with overloaded ciruits until it came---the The Elephant Love Medley. Ewan McGregor's uncanny ability to put that sparkle he must reseve only for love scenes and his lucky wife in his eye brought it all together.No longer were there crazy dwarves or yodeling and goons and sitars, suddenly the love story came together. It's always like that with me in my reviews I guess. Whatever is going on around the characters is secondary to the story. While Moulin Rouge is essentialy a script about saving a theater by selling the favors of a courtesian. The theater has no heart without the players within, and the beating of that heart will only continue as long as the love between Satine and Christian thrives.There is plenty of humor, especially in the ""Like a Virgin"" scene in which Satine is given a night's reprieve from the evil Duke, but Satine is already dying of consumption as the first frames of the movie unfold.In short we know there are no happy endings in this lush, vibrant, loud and gauche world of the Moulin Rouge err we first run away from home seeking out fortune as a writer with Christian. Living through Christian we know our entire presence at the Moulin Rouge is doomed from day one. Each spin of the wheel that graces Satine's apartments brings us closer to our unhappy ending and still there is nothing to do but sit as an audience and watch as the pre-ordained events unfold before us.The story of Moulin Rouge is not a happy one. The Green Fairy is no Tinkerbell. The story of Moulin Rouge is something that we must take piece by piece and bit by bit forgetting the doom that awaits and evaluate each scene on it's own merit. In doing so can we honestly say this is a movie that deserved to be up there as Oscar nominated best picture of the year? Can we look at Nicole Kidman and see the expensive prostitute who know's her worth in gold and has traded it for ink and paper? Can we believe that spark in Ewan McGregor's eye when he goes from peasant Bohemian writer to ardent lover in minutes?I think so. I think Baz Luhrman hit his mark in the red curtain series. Strictly Ballroom, William Shakespeares's Romeo and Juliette, and his masterpiece Moulin Rouge.A standing ovation for all three."	5.0	I almost thought I'd hate it	2005-05-31	5	5	0

But that's a compliment, not a complaint.Director Baz Luhrmann perfectly uses visual representation of the various themes and emotions displayed throughout the film. He uses the changing style from ecclectic, to dark, to heartbreaking in order to accentuate the emotions deep within an otherwise traditional story.It goes without saying that the musical numbers are heart stopping, especially El Tango De Roxanne and The Show Must Go On, and the chemistry between the two leads in thick and heartwarming.	5.0	A perfect example of style over substance that works flawlessly.	2013-05-21	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A13TO1ZFAH9SVN	Matthew Edmundson	You wouldn't think a movie that is flamboyant and over the top like Moulin Rouge would work. Nothing looks like it makes sense but it all falls together to make a very special movie.Christian(McGreggor) is a poor writer. He knows almost nothing of love, but is determined to write about it. He teams up with some of his neighbors who want to produce a play. They need a screenwriter so they get Christian to do it. They want to have there play seen at the Moulin Rouge. The local theater and whorehouse. It's there that Christian meets Satine.(Kidman) He quickly falls in love with the beautiful courtesan who feels the same way for him. She agrees reluctantly to star in there play. They need money for there play though. They get a local Duke(Roxburg) to give them money to make the play. He in return wants the full service and love of Satine. Christan and Satine now must hide there love before they are caught as they try to make this play about there love work.Nicole Kidman is awesome in this film. She plays Satine like nobody else could of. She finished filming this movie and spent time promoting it during her high profile divorce from Tom Cruise. She was very stressed and you can really tell towards the end of the movie. Her character in the movie is very stressed because she had TB and shes in a love triangle that could end her life. Kidman releases some of her real life stress on the screen and thats why this is such a special performance. She deserved the Oscar nomination she got for this role and really she should have won.Ewan McGreggor is fantastic in the movie. This guy really is an underrated actor. He continually gets small movies like this and puts out unforgetable performances. He's finally coming to his own as one of the hottest rising actors in Hollywood. He should have gotten as Oscar nomination for this role and in most years would have gotten it.The music is really great in Moulin Rogue. Kidman and McGreggor both display there great vocals. I love it when Ewan sings &quot;Your Song.&quot; He really does have a good voice and I thought the producers should have promoted him singing the song more. They really could have attracted more people to the movie. None of the songs are original and it's humorous to see songs like &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; sung in the late 1890's. It doesn't make sense but it works. My favortie song from the movie is the love medley from the Elephant Room.The movie looks fantastic on screen. The movie won Oscars for best sets and best costumes. It's really easy to see why the movie won them. Everything looks fantastic and you really do feel like you are in 19 century France.This is a fantastic musical. It really has jump started the musical genre and movies like Chicago wouldn't have been as successful without this picture. It's a fun movie that would be enjoyed by almost everybody. If you want to see an enchanting musical and romantic movie than go get this now.	5.0	A movie that really works	2004-04-26	3	1	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	"Moulin Rouge doesn't only revive the movie musical, it reinvents it for the 21st Century. In doing so, it has stirred up quite a bit of controversy and debate, as well it should. Any artistic effort that throws convention out the window does this. Part of the public embraces it as visionary, while the rest dismisses it as a failure and a fraud. Many times the elements that turn some people on are the same ones that turn others off. I tell you this because, while it's one of my favorite films of 2001, I readily admit it isn't for everyone.I saw Moulin Rouge twice in one week at the same theater, which is highly unusual for me. Obviously, as a reviewer, I don't have time to dwell long on any one movie. Both times the same thing happened. Some audience members applauded at several times, but others walked out disgusted. Those who stayed and enjoyed it were many times greater in number than those who left.The plot is slim. It's mainly a device to attach the music to. Christian [Ewan McGregor] is a young British writer who comes to Paris in 1900 to savor the Bohemian lifestyle, which is in full swing. Much of this lifestyle revolves around the Moulin Rouge nightclub, where dancers perform the infamous cancan and where courtesans sell their favors to wealthy gentlemen, young and old. The star of the club is the glamorous Satine [Nicole Kidman], who is also its most sought after courtesan. Satine and Christian are introduced by the artist Toulouse-Latrec [John Lequizamo] and his followers. The couple falls in love, but her lifestyle and his poverty create an insurmountable barrier to true love's fulfillment.The movie has little regard for time and space. The Paris it creates is a fantasy and a dream. The real city was never like this. Director Baz Luhrman, who first came to international attention with the remarkable Australian film, Strictly Ballroom, works with the idea that artistic or hip types a hundred years ago were not so unlike their counterparts of today. His characters don't sing and dance to music from their time, but from ours. In a memorable scene early in the movie, Toulouse-Latrec and his gang are agonizing on the lyrics to a song that's part of a musical they are writing. Christian, who has been commandeered to assist them, suddenly bursts into ""The Hill Are Alive"" from The Sound of Music. This is not the only time Luhrman uses a song from an older, more traditional musical. The movie is also filled with songs by such late 20th Century music icons as Elton John and David Bowie. It may be the only film taking place at the end of the 19th Century that rocks.The editing is extremely kinetic. Few images last more than a few seconds. This will irritate some viewers because the process may give them a headache and because the lavish production numbers tend to be especially choppy and fast. I found this technique to be exhilarating. It gives the movie a look and feel that underscores the desperation and anxiety simmering underneath the festive air. Its the same emotional contradiction found at today's discos and rave parties.The cast is brilliant. It's spectacular. ... [Nicole Kidman] can be dramatic, funny, beguiling, seductive and vulnerable. She can also sing and dance. Ewan McGregor is equally versatile. They make a dynamic couple on screen. Jim Broadbent gives and Oscar-worthy performance as Harold Zidler, the owner and MC of Moulin Rouge, as does the amazing John Lequizamo as Toulouse-Latrec.I loved this movie, if for no other reason than that it broke the mold. It is bold and adventuresome. Most films follow formulas that seem set in stone, partly because audiences are comforted by them. Occasionally, though, it's good to have one that rattles your soul."	5.0	A Sparkling Gem of a Movie!	2002-03-11	8	6	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3KCG8WIOPP631	Matthew Jackson	This has to be my favorite musical of all time. The way they blend different songs into the dialogue of the film is simply amazing, tying song to story in a way that creates a flowing and creative story.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3H2K3442NY63P	Matthew Pursley	So THIS is what happens when screenwriters are high! This movie, though excellent, has a definite halluciogenic feel to it, complete with swirling colors and dancing fairies, not to mention the fact that the herione lives in a giant elephant!Be alert and clear headed when you watch this movie, or you will lose the plot in the flashing lights and sometimes surreal musical numbers. Bare bones plot summary: The hero is a naive young writer who falls in love with a beautiful performer and courtesan, and he must struggle to win her love and thwart the plans of the duke, who plans to marry her. Sound like a simple plot, but it is carried out in a spectacular fashion, thick with both comical and tender moments, as well as the requisite tearjerker scenes. Oh, did I mention the music? Almost anyone will recognise at least one of the songs in this movie, which are borrowed from such artists as Gilbert and Sullivan, Rodgers and Hammerstein, classic Broadway, The Beatles, and even Madonna! Who knew that Nicole or Ewan could sing like that? I sure didn't! Whether you love it or hate it, I doubt that you have ever seen anything quite like Moulin Rouge!	4.0	What a trip!	2002-02-04	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1VMMKR1GOXIZ	"""mattioli"""	Many people will not even notice the feature on this DVD that, for me, makes it the excellent movie it is.  Just about every theatrical quality of this movie has been reviewed to death, so I'm going to try and avoid that and mention a feature that will make the movie for a small but, to me at least, important group.If you insert this DVD and navigate to the languages menu you'll find a language entitled something like, &quot;audio description for the visually impaired.&quot; If you select this feature and play the DVD you'll notice short spoken descriptions of action, setting, costuming, etc inserted so as not to interfere with the dialog of the movie.If you don't happen to be visually impaired yourself, or if you don't happen to be watching with someone who is, simply don't select this language and your viewing experience will proceed as if this option didn't even exist.With DVD being a media that permits storage of truly astounding quantities of data, there is little, good, reason for movie producers not to include such an audio description on their DVD releases.  Nevertheless, we see the vast majority of DVD releases coming out without this small but exceedingly appreciated accomodation.  Any movie studio that does include this feature on their DVD releases has my vote, especially if the movie provides me good entertainment alongside the rest of my family.  This was a good film, an excellent production and a terrific example of how a movie studio can make a minor accomodation that can provide real benefit!	4.0	Odd Concept, Great Production	2003-12-30	2	1	1

Unquestionably one of the 10 worst movies ever made, although it doesn't even deserve to be called a movie. A lacerated video clip more like it. Nominated for a bunch of Oscars, together with A BEAUTIFUL MIND(another overrated dose of sugar), it proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that those awards are completely political &amp; utterly misguided. As many will agree, CHICAGO was everything this dismal effort so desperately yearned to be. A girlfriend of mine told me she cried when Satine(Nicole Kidman)died. I was incredulous. Who cared???? (I was overjoyed since it meant the ordeal was nearly over) With Richard Roxburgh apparently suffering from constipation coupled with Tourette's &amp; Jim Broadbent(usually brilliant)doing some sort of Quentin Crisp/Tootsie impersonation, I would equate this experience with a 3 day migraine. What in God's name were they smoking in the editing room?	1.0	This Proves That Oscars Are Bought	2004-07-11	24	14	10

It's always disappointing when a movie delivers lackluster costumes and appearances - yeah, costumes aren't the same as the story or acting - but seeing lavish and beautiful costumes are ALWAYS a treat. If you're a costumer or like fashion in general, be sure to check this out. You might even get some ideas for your own projects.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A6GP2GL631TEL	"M. Dow ""Pedaling in Pittsburgh"""	Moulin Rouge is my all time favorite movie! If you love musicals and are open to new experiences you'll be thrilled with this film. The majority of people who hated this movie are those who don't think that movies can be an interactive experience for the audience. The film urges you to sing along, dance in your seat (or out of it now that we can view it at home), and cry at the beautiful ending when the lovers get back together. I can see this one reaching the cult status of Rocky Horror and I'd love to participate in a showing with the same call-back format. The reason for the montage of love songs lies in the overall context of the story. Moulin Rouge is based on the myth of Orpheus; a poet who could create the most amazing songs. To convey this extroardinary gift to a modern audience, Christian is able to spout out the greatest lyrics of the greatest love songs of our time. When we hear &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; and the rest, we can bring all of the emotional baggage that we have in connection to these songs to our experience of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; and say, &quot;Wow! This Guy is Good!&quot;The more you see Moulin Rouge, the more you get out of it. I didn't understand the movie after the first movie and therefore wasn't too crazy about it. I'm so glad that I went with my friend to see it again, because after that, I was hooked! If you are ready to let go and have a great time, this one's for you.

I loved everything about this film, from the trademark Luhrmann editing, to the bigger-than-big dance sequences, to the absolutely trite and predictable storyline, to the little &quot;see who recognizes the pop reference first&quot; game that you inevitably play against whomever your watching this film with.  This is what happens when you combine a smart, young, creative filmmaker with Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein.  The acting?  Nothing to write home about.  The singing?  I've heard better.  But it isn't any one element that sells this movie, it's the grandeur of it that makes it a wonderful EXPERIENCE.

Luhrmann keeps piling up bad 70s  pop songs, relentless kitsch, bad 80s pop songs, dizzying camerawork, bad 90s pop songs, huge dance numbers, bad Rogers and Hammerstein songs and narcoleptic Argentinians, one upon the other, until he creates this massive, frenetic, rococo tower of crazed pop images that lists wildly back and forth in the wind, but somehow manages never to collapse upon itself.

With unique camera action, wierd, wacky and wonderful sets, delightfully surprising musical adaptations and more than a touch of the fantastic, Moulin Rouge is sure to please. McGregor's performance, both dramatic and vocal, is to die for. How can one person be so shamelessly multi-talented?Kidman does an excellent job as the courtesan &quot;Satine&quot;. Though her singing did not have the &quot;wow&quot; factor of McGregor's, it was more than adequate for the task. And many of the hopeless love songs she performed seemed quite touching when one recalls her present situation in real life.If you don't like musicals, see Moulin Rouge anyway.

Every aspect of this movie is incredible.  Baz Lurhmann combines spectacular theatrics with a tender love story.  Nicole Kidman is fabulous as the lovely cabaret singer Satine, but Ewan McGregor is the real star of this movie.  He has one of the most incredible voices I've ever heard and could easily abandon his acting career to start a rock band.  The supporting cast is outstanding, especially Jim Broadbent as the MC/owner of the Moulin Rouge and Richard Roxburgh as the slimy Duke who will do just about anything to get Satine for himself.People have complained that this movie is &quot;all over the place.&quot; I've read reviews that gripe about the spinning camera shots and the fact that none of the music is original.  What is WRONG with these people?!  The fact that music from so many different genres is represented in this film is what makes it so brilliant!  Even though the film is set in the 1890s, people are belting out classic Madonna and Elton John standards right and left, and it totally works with the environment that Luhrmann has created.  The unconventional camera shots help to illustrate the glitzy and glamourous world that these people have created for themselves at the Moulin Rouge.  Nothing about this movie is annoying, it's unique and incredible.  People who aren't very open-minded when it comes to originality probably would disagree with me, but too bad.  It's their loss.This two-disc DVD set is also one of the best Special Edition DVDs that I've ever seen.  The design elements of the menus have the same flashy style as the movie itself, and there are a ton of entertaining bonus features.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2BHWOS5PUGU78	Mercy Bell	&quot;This story is about love...the woman I loved is.....dead.&quot; That's the first line of this film, and sets the tone. But first let me tell you about the DVD.Great DVD! LOTS of features. There are 2 CDs and the second one is purely bonus features. I haven't been through all of them yet. One of my faves is the ongoing commentary from either the production designer, director, writer, or cinematographer, you can turn on while watching the film; and the multicamera angle and uncut dance sequences. This is a milestone in DVD making. It's loaded.As for the film, this is a better movie than I imagined. It sells itself as a colorful drama, but it's a musical through and through. It's officially a TragiComiDramaMusical, or that's what the critics call it, but it gets to your heartstrings and senses and kicks them.Baz Luhrmann had a theory for this film, that music and razzle dazzle and color will create a heightened experience, and it worked. People may pay more attention to it for it's astounding technical abilities, but I was mainly captivated by it's music, acting, and it's storyline. Not to say I didn't like the color and razor sharp editing, quite the contrary. I was purely amazed at what they achieved. But that they could go over that and send a clear cut and emotional story with superb acting, is something you rarely see in any &quot;super charged&quot; films.The story is loosely based on the Greek Tragedy about Orhpeus. It revolves around the young Christian (Ewan McGregor) who enters the world of the Moulin Rouge and Montmarte to become a great writer. He befriends some strange Bohemians and is assigned to write a show for the MR called &quot;Spectacular! Spectacular!&quot;. He has to recruit the courtesan Satine, but falls in love with her. Eventually they both become enmeshed in their love for each other, the dirty and treacherous goings on of the MR, and the making of the show. After betrayal and intrigue, the film ends with a tragic ending you knew was coming from Christian's first line: &quot;This story is about love...the woman I loved is.....dead.&quot;The acting is much better than I expected. People had been talking about how Kidman could get a Oscar nomination for her performance in this, but I had thought &quot;Why? It's a musical. There's no such thing as good acting in musicals.&quot; Nicole shines. She goes through several stages in the film and is always believable at the level she chooses. Especially in her TB scenes, where she plays sick, she does a very unglamorous and ugly portrayal of the disease. She does comedy and seduction and heroism in one role, and it's not at all cliche. McGregor particularly surprised me. I had known he was a good actor, but not as good as he is in this film. He also goes through stages, and pulls it off with his ability to act completly natural. He's by far one of the best natural actors I've ever seen, and some of his body language and facial gestures do the role a great deal of good. It's hard to act &quot;innocent&quot; without getting terribly annoying, and he's never annoying, but maybe because he's more of a decent and kind character than the stereotypical &quot;innocent&quot;. Supporting characters shine, and John Leguizamo deserves a thumbs up for a particularly painful but strong performance (if you hear how they shortened him). Jim Broadbent, who plays the enabling and sweet pimp Zidler (it's tough to call him that, but that's what he is), is fantastic, and Richard Roxborough who plays the Duke, is notorious and does a wonderful job at being completely and one hundred percent devious.This movie shines, and it addicts you. Many people have said you either love it or hate it, and I'd say it's true. It will either overwhelm you, or you'll like it for all it is. It's supposed to be overboard. It's supposed to have that &quot;If it exists we'll use it just because.&quot; That's the whole point. It's a beautiful film, and it's very true, it follows how life works. There are people who'll be bad to you, and people who will love you, and not everything works as you want it. It's supposed to be an experience, not just a date at the movies.	5.0	Immerse Yourself in Emotion....Spectacular film, great DVD	2002-01-03	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AMG2LF8MLUDN1	M. Fields	Great imagery and catchy tunes.  This film is as interesting to watch as it is to listen to.  The fun thing with the music in this movie is that during the time all this decadence was taking place, most of the tunes hadn't been written yet! Kidman & McGregor do a fairly okay job of singing their songs.  They can both hold a tune and their voices work fairly well for this project but let's not start casting them in any serious musicals just yet.  While their voices are fine here, as a rule, their voices are much too weak for anything more than what they have accomplished here.This musical is a lot of fun and I say that as a person who does not like musicals.  In fact I hate them.  As with Luhrmanns's Romeo & Juliet, Moulin Rouge has a special quality that helps the dialogue scenes flow smoothly into the musical numbers.  I can only imagine what it would have sounded like if two real singers had been cast.  Of course if the singers can't act then we have a problem so better to go with the actors instead.The dance numbers are fresh and very unique.  I give them two thumbs up.  I'm at a loss to describe them.  You'll have to see for yourself.I reccomend it highly.Parental advisory:  Buy with confidence.  No foul language, nudity or sex.  Some scenes may be too intense for young children.  I advise a viewing age of at least 15 years old.	5.0	Another eye popping spectacle from Baz Luhrmann	2005-02-25	2	2	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2GZTI0EIOCQNZ	"M. Hind ""daria_m"""	The first time I saw this film it was in a theatre with only ten other people in it.  I wasn't bothered, although now I wish more people had seen it.  I was able to view it with minimal distractions and I was glad.  It is one of the most remarkable movies I have ever seen.I will admit that I wasn't a fan of Baz Luhrman's take on &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot;  Guess why?  I thought it was too modern.  I threw that criticism aside and saw what I could only describe as a modern take on a turn-of-the-century Paris romance.  For some reason, I thought the remakes of many of today's best songs really fit the film.  This is a pop-clad, trippy, fantastic trip to the past.  Yet it holds on to something we can relate to.Ewan McGregor, my knight in shining armor, is wonderful.  He enveloped the character of Christian with the right amount of boyish charm and heartache (and sings quite well too!). Such a breakthrough for him. Needless to say, Nicole Kidman is gorgeous and perfect for the part of Satine.  She most certainly deserved her Golden Globe and her Oscar nod. John Leguizamo said it best when he called her &quot;a modern day Ann Margret.&quot;An underrated spectacular performance came from Jim Broadbent as the flamboyant Harry Zidler. He demonstrates a lot of power in this role that often gets ignored because it's supporting.Enjoy the lights, the costumes, the glamour, the music of this landmark cinematic achievement.  Don't forget: always believe in truth, freedom, beauty, and above all things, love.	5.0	A musical rebirth......embrace it!	2002-06-09	5	4	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AD5BM7Z2XILF9	Michael Adams	At the Theatre, within the 1st 10 minutes, I thought, &quot;this is MTV, I'm ouuta Here.&quot; But instead, somehow I just sort of &quot;went into Baz's world of the Moulin Rouge&quot;. At some undetermined point, I found that the songs of Nirvana, Paul McCartney &amp; Wings, Elton John, took me back to the Grand Musicals of the 40's, and 50's that I saw as a kid of the sixties, but this had all of the advantages of C.G.! In an unbelievable, and overwhelming assualt of the senses and emotions, I downright WANTED to be there.  Nicole Kidman, who LEARNED how to be a &quot;showgirl&quot; to play her Role of Satine, the &quot;Sparkling Diamond&quot; Star of the overwhelming sights, sounds and events at the Moulin Rouge, has been photgraphed in the style of the Greats. She pulls it off without a hitch. Her talents seem endless. If middle America thinks of her as &quot;the ex Mrs. Cruise&quot;, they are just plain missing out on one of the best actresses of our time. Ewan McGregor was wide eyed innocence personified, the Love-Struck dreamer that never once needed a &quot;Light Sabre&quot; (Phantom Menace) or a &quot;Tattoo&quot; (Pillow book) or &quot;Glam Hair&quot; (Velvet Goldmine). The actor is a chameleon, and should be bound for Superstardom. Together they, well, ROCKED. So then did the DVD... Spent 4 hours at the computer on December 18th, when I had soooo much else I really needed to do, just &quot;playing&quot; with Disc 2, and all it state of the art features.This odd, strange, sad, yet remarkable Motion Picture (it's too different to merely call it a Movie), has made it into my top ten. Possibly five. Wow. That's really something. I'm 39 years old, and have been in and around the business for a long time. Hats off, Baz... oh wait... you DID that in the Picture! Although, on the small screen, you may need to scan back to see the hats fly. It's so cool, it's worth it.	5.0	Modern Filmaking Meets The &quot;Golden Era&quot;	2002-01-06	1	1	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1QGTFD0ZJ3KG8	Michael B.	Moulin Rouge is a spectacular film that redefines the &quot;hollywood&quot; musical. Most of the songs are updated versions from some of the best artists of our time like Sting, Elton John, and Madonna.When I first saw Moulin Rouge it wasn't what I expected at all. The first few scenes are hyper and strange, but in a good way, its fun to watch. But then, when Ewan McGregor goes to the Moulin Rouge to meet Nicole Kidman and breaks into that first note of &quot;Your Song&quot;, I found myself under the movie's spell. That scene still gives me chills. hahaAnyways, it will probably be a movie that you will either love or hate. Its so different from any film out there, but I think thats what makes it so magical. Its daring, different, and totally redefines &quot;musical&quot;. Its definitely worth seeing once so you can decide for yourself. You be the judge.The DVD is absolutely jammed-pack with a ton of extra features on it, which I haven't even gone through all of them yet. I have not seen a DVD so thorough to this date.This movie and DVD will definitely become a classic!	5.0	A Movie That Booms With Energy!	2002-03-24	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A26IC9NA08FLGY	Michael Brodt	Let me first start out by prefacing what I have to say with: this is a movie that either you will love or you will hate. If you go into it with the understanding that you are going to see a musical, your appreciation for what it is might increase.Baz Lurhman does a wonderful job at not just forming the world in which this story takes place, but developing the atmosphere surrounding the story.The story is what many people might consider basic by today's standards. True, it doesn' t have crazy, often times dizzying twists and turns that many of today's modern stories have. It is a rather simplistic story, as were in many of the musicals of old that are loved such as &quot;Singing In The Rain.&quot;The music, though not from the timeframe of the movie, compliments the storyline, which is what music in a musical is supposed to do.The biggest misconception that people have about this film is that it is not like a lot of today's modern movies and love stories... and they are right. It isn't supposed to be. It is a musical story about one of our most basic, yet often complicated, and always prized emotions... love. It is a visually stunning masterpiece that incorperates all the positives of the musicals from the past, simple yet interesting storyline, good music, strong, multilayered characters, and adds in todays modern imagery, to create what should be hailed as a resounding sucess of a film.	5.0	A Modern Musical Masterpiece	2001-11-16	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1HK2DJWCXCXN1	Michael Brown	I was mesmerized on my first viewing of this film, having never seen anything like it.  The choice of modern songs blew me away.  For years, film-makers have been searching for a way to use music to tell stories without jumping into an un-real world of singing and dancing in inappropriate, un-real scenarios.  This film is an exercise in that quest.  The classic device of using a play within a play is brilliantly used, again drawing attention to the real/unreal quality of musicals.  The extra features are expansive, and can really expand ones understanding of the theme of this film.	5.0	Post-Post Modern Musical Story-telling	2005-07-27	8	8	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AEG3I82BVE2ZK	"Michael Cornett ""Madman"""	"I know it's been praised by fans and critics.  It got the Oscars it deserved (Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design).  It was totally undeserving of its Best Picture nod, as well as all the acting nods.Where does it fail?  Oy vey...The story, for one thing.  One cliche after another, to the point where it becomes boring and predictable.  Within a half hour of the movie's beginning, you know everything that's going to happen and how it's going to end.  Yawn.The acting?  Kidman is good (but not Oscar-worthy...she was far superior in THE OTHERS) and her singing is not bad at all.  But she shouldn't quit her day job.  Ewan McGregor was OK, but as a couple, they failed miserably.  Zero chemistry.  Just not believable as a romantic pair.  The rest of the cast just stood around and looked grotesque.The direction?  What a mess!  MR fans whine about Luhrmann not getting a Best Director nod.  Guess what?  He didn't deserve it!...  The movie lurches drunkenly between comedy and tragedy, and never fully succeeds at either.  The tragedy is too contrived and artificial, and is weakened by the attempts at comedy.  The comedy doesn't work because it's very forced and cartoonish, and is undermined by the tragedy.The editing?  Another mess!  It looks like it was edited with a Cuisinart.  I found out recently that this movie was heavily re-edited several times, and its general release delayed for almost a year, while they fine-tuned it.  A lot of continuity was probably left on the cutting-room floor.  The first 30 minutes is the most maddening film ever put on celluloid or DVD; when I saw it in the theater, half the audience walked out during the first half-hour.  And what's the use of all those gorgeous sets if you can't focus on them for more than a nanosecond?This film also pretends to celebrate love, but never explores it more than on the most superficial level.  Christian and Satine are never truly in love, only infatuated; we never get to see their love develop into any real maturity, and never get any sense of an intellectual or spiritual connection, just physical desire.And that gawdawful line...""The greatest thing you can ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.""  BARF!...  What a treacly, mawkish, manipulative piece of garbage!...  Obviously a cynical attempt to appeal to the Lydia Languishes of the world.  (For those who don't recognize the name, it's a character from the play THE RIVALS, a girl more interested in the glamor and intrigues of romance than in actually having a deep, mature, enduring love.)MOULIN ROUGE is horrendously smug and inordinately pleased with itself.  Watching it is like having Baz Luhrmann sitting next to you, nudging you with his elbow and saying, ""Look!  Look at how I did that!  Isn't that cool?  Aren't I so hip and cool?""This movie pretends to celebrate its oversimplified version of Bohemian values: Love, Freedom, Truth, and Beauty.  But it ends up making a mockery of them.  There's so much grotesquerie...it wallows in artifice and contrivance....love is never realistically explored...and expressing your freedom comes at a horrible price.And how about that ending?  I found the end of the film profoundly depressing.  Not only was Satine dead, but I was personally left with the feeling that Christian was going to kill himself.  The Moulin Rouge cabaret was closed because of him.  His friends were now all unemployed because of him.  He had ruined so many lives, just so he could pursue an adolescent crush.  The final message MOULIN ROUGE gives is not that love is wonderful...the message is, ""Don't fall in love.  You'll just get hurt, and hurt people around you.  You'll just end up abandoned and alone, ready to put a bullet in your brain.""  I'm amazed that this film's fans ignore that, or aren't able to pick up on that."	1.0	Superficial, Sentimental, Sappy Swill	2002-09-19	21	8	13
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2UDXOIA9CKC9W	Michael E. Mason	Moulin Rouge is a gritty thought provoking portrayal of two lovers who were never meant to be. Baz Lurhmann's use of photography and color make this movie surpass any of 2000. The musical has been a dying format for years but Moulin Rouge has brought it to a newer, hipper atmosphere. The use of costumes, sets, lights, and choreography and some of the best performance from Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor make this the must see film of the year. Don't miss your chance to buy this film and see what Truth, Beauty, Love, And Freedom, are all about in the bohemian film Moulin Rouge.	5.0	Moulin Rouge shines above all!!!!!!!!!!!	2001-10-21	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3ASO9OD8GXZO1	Michael Fehlauer	I laughed, I cried, it was much better than... well, any movie in recent memory.Moulin Rouge is wonderful fantasy, a movie that knows it's a movie and uses all of its tools to best effect. As compared to other movies, which are often nothing more than plays captured with cameras. The director of Moulin Rouge speeds up the film, dazzles with fancy editing, tosses up special effects, and uses a complete motion picture pallete to create a truly moving, exhilirating experience.I've read some high falootin' critics complain that the movie has a thin plot, or is unrealistic. Ummm... Moulin Rouge is a *musical*. The Sound of Music wasn't exactly Shakespeare. Cats is more than a little fantastical. These poor fools missed the entire point of the movie; they should just sit back, open their eyes, ears, and hearts, and be entertained by a movie that had my audience laughing, groaning, sighing, clapping, and weeping. And smooching. After all, Moulin Rouge is a movie about, above all, Love.A special aside to couples: this is a TERRIFIC date movie. If you don't have your arm aroung your dear one throughout this movie, you should get that heart jump-started at the ER before you completely stiffen up.	5.0	Wow. What an entertaining fantasy!

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3T5NSG7LMRY0A	Michael Gmirkin	Honestly, I didn't care for this movie. Reviews have often been positive. A bit too positive, I think. For me, this movie was more than a bit of a mess the entire way through.I mean, I get what they were TRYING to do. For me, it just fell completely flat.The basic premise is something of a comedy of errors mixed with a love story and told through song and dance. But it just never seemed to gel, for me.For one thing, the musical numbers were a mish-mash of little snippets of other musical numbers from musicals, popular/rock music (Queen, Madonna, etc., etc.)... Whether that's terribly original or not, I don't know. I mean, I myself have occasionally fancied doing the same thing: mashing up related lyrics from different songs to create a new story. (Eg. Jamie is Crying + It's My Party and I'll Cry if I Want To + Jamie's Got a Gun.) I mean, I can see the attraction of such mashups.Again, for me, it just didn't work. I wanted to like it. It was colorful, if nothing else. It wanted to be 'expansive' and bold, but, I don't know, at the same time it felt somehow claustrophobic and too Gilliam-esque (not unlikeThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen) with all the tight-in close-ups and awkward scenes, and not-quite-right makeup and wigs designed to throw the viewer slightly off kilter.	3.0	A Terry Gilliam-esque musical mashup?

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	&quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; directed by Baz Luhrmann, seems to be one of the most wildly polarizing films of its time; I get the impression that people either love it or loathe it. I found the film inconsistent, but ultimately both entertaining and technically impressive.MR is a musical set in late 19th century Paris, primarily at the nightclub of the title. The story involves the relationship between dance hall girl Satine (Nicole Kidman) and bohemian writer Christian (Ewan McGregor). Luhrmann mixes into the story songs (and snippets of songs) from many different decades of the 20th century, ranging from The Beatles' &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; to Madonnas's &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and much more. The result is like a wild ride on a chaotic musical time machine. This together with the outrageous costumes and wild visual effects makes MR at times a startling assault on the senses.I found the opening portion of the movie to be far too silly and hyperactive. But once Kidman and McGregor's characters meet, the film really starts to soar.The performances are on the whole outstanding. One performance that really didn't work was that of John Leguizamo as Toulouse Lautrec. The versatile Leguizamo, normally excellent in such character roles, is far too cartoonish and over-the top here. But this misstep is more than made up for by the rest of the cast. Kidman is a revelation as Satine; she becomes a true screen diva in this role. Jim Broadbent brings energetic fun to his role as showman Harold Zidler; his rendition of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; is one of the unforgettable highlights of the film.But the true heart of the film is Ewan McGregor's superb performance as Christian. He brings a palpable passion and tenderness to the role of the romantic dreamer. It's a brave, triumphant performance for this tremendously versatile actor.&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a daringly different film that succeeds overall as a piece of art. I give director Luhrmann a lot of credit for holding all of these elements together.	4.0	Erratic, but alive with music and color	2002-03-21	10	9	1

I was truly disappointed to discover that not many of his songs were on the soundtrack.  I cannot wait to own a copy of this movie so I can watch it over and over.

It may well be the most colorful movie to date. The visual effects are spectacular! Musically, the skill of incorporating lyrics from Elton John, The Beetles, Nirvana, and other modern pop artists was very nicely done.After hearing all the hoopla about the film, I was looking forward to seeing it. Hey, it is supposedly a great movie and I love Nicole Kidman, so I can't go wrong by investing a couple of hours watching it, right? Then I read some of the reviews posted here about how you will &quot;love it or hate it&quot; and found it more alluring. So I got some popcorn and set out on my journey. Well, I didn't HATE it, but sadly, it really didn't do anything for me. I can appreciate it for what it is, but quite frankly, after about a half hour, I went into the kitchen and started washing dishes. NOT what I was hoping for. (Yes, I kept going back periodically to see if I was missing something. I wasn't).I viewed it as `Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' meets `The Rocky Horror Picture Show'. A musical fantasy with better effects but without the chemistry or the rice.I as I have sated, I don't like musicals. I'd much rather see something more realistic or weirdly captivating. NOT a film where the actors break into song for no apparent reason. It's not for me, but I still give it 4/5 for visual appeal.	4.0	If you like musicals...	2002-07-13	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A21EZ3M5XP4A6O	Michael Paulsen	"What a schizophrenic movie this is ... definitely way overhyped in an era where films are made based on video games (Resident Evil coming to a theatre near you). If this is some attempt to revive ""the musical"" for the 21st century, then it misses the mark by a wide margin. The first half is such a miserable, cut-and-paste hodgepodge of MTV-style editing and snippets of contemporary pop songs and classic musical tunes come fast and furious, interwoven and absolutely absurdly arranged. Funny? Cute? Ingeniously postmodern? How 'bout lazy and stupid?! (At least for me, it was). I was about to give up on this movie 30 minutes in, but I stuck it out. The second half actually settles down into a tolerable romantic musical that is more reasonably paced and edited, redeeming what would otherwise be a colossal turkey of a movie on the level of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band or, hey, Ishtar.Other redeeming pluses are the strikingly good and resonant voices of both Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor, even if their acting is a bit tepid at times. Unfortunately, as much as I like John Leguizamo, his performance as Toulouse (Lautrec?) is forced and just plain irritating.In short, this a freakshow of a film that is essentially 1/2 turkey and 1/2 passable musical."	3.0	Miserable 1st half, tolerable 2nd half	2002-03-01	8	3	5
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2DT16LCU7OEBU	Michael Puckett	"I was anxious to say the least about seeing Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge."" Based on what I had seen in the trailers, it looked to be a really delicious piece of film making. But, as I sat in the darkened theater, I quickly became aware that I was not totally prepared for the inspired vision that was about to unfold.""Moulin Rouge"" is nothing short of dazzling, a wild-eyed, acid trip of a movie, that looks and sounds like nothing you've ever seen before. The first 45 minutes of this reinvented musical are a dizzying blur that will leave you gasping to catch your breath. It's like being grabbed up by the seat of your pants and hurled through a cartoon, cardboard cutout of Paris, (circa 1900). It is at the same time garish, bawdy, and beautiful, sort of like riding a terrifying thrill ride, at 100 miles per hour and the minute it's over you want to run to get back in line, to ride it again.The story is a classic opera tale that centers around the characters Christian, a penniless writer, played with class and style by Ewan McGregor, and Satine, the beautiful star, and courtesan of the fabled ""Moulin Rouge,"" played by gorgeous Nicole Kidman. The incredible scenes between Ewan and Nicole literally light up the screen with love and excitement. They sing... they dance and they do both damn well! It's pure joy watching these two forbidden lovers cavort across the star lit sky, literally singing with the moon of their secret love.""Moulin Rouge"" features some great contemporary songs by Elton John, ""Your Song,"" Madonna, ""Like A Virgin,"" and Sting, ""Roxanne,"" all reinterpreted into some of the most eye-popping musical production numbers put on film since the 1940's. The entire supporting cast-of-characters, including a fabulous performance by Jim Broadbent, add just the right balance to round out this loopy, lopsided kaleidoscope of a movie.I have seen a lot of musicals over the years, some great, some not so great, but I don't believe I have ever seen one that has affected me in such an odd way as ""Moulin Rouge."" This wonderful film has broken the tired old mold of movie musicals and given it a vibrant, shinny new life, and quite frankly, that's a very good thing!The DVD is incredible, with enough behind the scenes features, to keep you happy for hours. This one is a must for your collection."	5.0	I Love This Movie!!!	2002-03-29	5	4	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2R9J5LULVKF6T	Michael T. Rognlien	How interesting that a movie such as Moulin Rouge could have such a deeply divided audience - you'll rarely hear anyone say they &quot;liked it,&quot; only that they loved it or hated it.Assuming you're even looking at this product and/or its reviews insinuates that you're on the &quot;loved it&quot; camp, so I will skip the obligatory thematic review and skip right to the plusses of the format.The DVD version of the film lives up to expectations, as this was quite a technically stunning film.  Lots of work went into all aspects of the movie, and the extras on the DVD showcase this extensive work quite nicely.  There are extended looks behind the costumes, the unique and refreshing music (who but Baz Luhrmann could turn &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; into a cabaret number?) and the myriad other technical intricacies of this fine film.Interestingly enough, I felt the strongest performance in the film was that of Ewan McGregor, so it was a shame that he was left out of the Oscar nominations.  Nicole Kidman shines and Jim Broadbent, who also should have been nominated for his performance of Harold Zidler, often steals the screen.Another great Ewan McGregor film to check out (for those who are interested) is Velvet Goldmine, a 70's era punk rock musical that also features his fine vocal abilities.. maybe someday he'll cut an album.Until then, Moulin Rouge on DVD is one of the best packaged DVD's out there, and for the money, a 2-disc set is well worth the asking price.	5.0	The best movie of 2001	2002-03-25	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	APRCJ3J03PBL7	Michael Tropp	This was a movie that immediately jumped onto my favorites list. The love story that just mesmerized me. I watched it three times in a row after seeing it for the first time. Baz Luhrmanm is an incredible director. The camera work in this movie is amazing, the zoom in-and-out from the Eiffel Tower to the Moulin Rouge looks so cool. I love the fun feeling throughout the movie, of stolen songs, dancing in the clouds, fairies, the impromptu play, the dancing, singing, and the all around fun of the movie. Love stories are definitely not my favored genre, but this movie just changed all of my thoughts on movie plots. This movie includes wonderful song lyrics and vocals throughout the whole movie. You will love Ewan and Nicole's back-and-forth lyrics to each other. My favorite part is by far the part when Ewan is singing to her in the clouds. The surrealism and un-realistic quality of the scene offered me comedy and yet showed a serious love feeling to it. All of the characters in this movie are very comical, yet they can all have their bad sides. For instance, the strange yet wryly funny Duke, being able to go from completely calm, to furious, and a few seconds later back to calm. I can most definitely see why this was up for best picture. I think anybody could get to love this movie.	5.0	MASTERPIECE!!	2002-08-13	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3L46ZRKNFN0SG	Michael W. Howe	"Baz Luhrmann was never a popular director of mine. While people in my high school loved his take on Romeo and Juliet, I turned away.  i preffered my Shakespeare classics just the way they were.  Then, when I heard about Moulin Rouge, I became entranced by the concept, and after seeing the film, it is truly spectacular!  Following Christian (Ewan McGregor), we start at the end as he tells us of the beginning, as he moves to Paris to take part in the Bohemian art movement.  He quickly meets the dwarf named Toulouse LaTrec (John Leguizamo, acting on his knees), and they set out along with Toulouse's friends, to try and get Satine (Nicole Kidman), one of the best of the Moulin Rouge's dancers, to be in their production.  After a mishap of mistaken identity, Satine realizes she has fallen in love with Christian.  However, this poses a problem to her manager Zeigler (Jim Broadbent), who wants to turn the Moulin Rouge into a theater.  However, the financeer, The Duke of Worcester, will owe his services on 2 conditions: 1-that Zeigler signs off the Moulin Rouge to him, and 2-that he makes it so that Satine is officially his.  This leads to many struggles of the characters as Christian and Satine try to be close to one another while not trying to let the Duke know.  Luhrmann also succeeds well in choosing the music for his musical.  Yes, this is a mus-i-call!!  Not since ""Dancer in the Dark"" have such sounds sounded so wonderful!  I actually bought the soundtrack.  But here are some notable areas of interest:1. Nirvana's ""Smells like Teen Spirit,"" though being sung by a number of 30-60 year old gentelmen in suits and top hats at the Moulin Rouge.2.Zeigler's rendition of ""Like a Virgin"" to cover for Satine's absence one night.  The performance is hilarious!!3.The pitch-to get out of a jam, Christian, Satine, Zeigler, Toulouse and his bunch, stage an interesting sales pitch to the Duke, to the tune of the Can-Can.  The number is so arousing, I actually applauded as soon as it ended!4.Tango Du Roxanne- 2 stories being told to an 80's song done in tango.  Feelings are played with, emotions are mixed: very powerful!There are plenty more, but you must see it for yourself!  I am a wacky, weird, artist type, and can easily say that I enjoyed it very much. There are many quick camera cuts here and there, but they work surprisingly well, and Baz does a waltzing on the clouds almost straight out of my imagination!

I was personally very surprised that Nicole could sing. The lack of cheesy voiceovers gave the film a degree of realism that was needed in such a surreal movie.Any student of cinematography will have to agree that the tricks used by the director of this film to hook you in worked. The strategic use of red, for passion and danger the polyphonic voicing within the scenes and the swirling camera scenes kept you hooked and riveted to get the meanings behind what was happening were truly Spectacular Spectacular.	5.0	Spectacular Spectacular	2002-04-16	3	1	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1QZ2P94TQEBDV	Michelle K. Rogers	I waited quite a while before seeing this movie.  I wasn't going to see it at all originally.  Not because I'm too mature to give in to hype, but because I was anti-Nicole.  It's not as though I love her now, but I guess she's not as bad as I made out...The first twenty minutes of the film had me a little worried - I was afraid I'd paid to see a stinker.  But once it got going; once I was mercilessly pulled into the bizarre world of the Moulin Rouge, I was mesmerised and bound to come out feeling overwhelmed at the end.The music, movement, colour and singing is extremely energetic and addictive.  The creative use of (good) popular songs that we all know is very clever, and gives the viewer a sense of familiarity in a way.  You already know the lyrics, so you don't need to grow accustomed to new tunes too often.I must make note of the amazing talents of one gorgeous Ewan McGregor - boy can that man sing!!  His voice is so rich and full of life that he manages to make good, popular tunes into wonderful, spine-tingling anthems of love (truth, beauty and freedom as well).  If 'movie musicals' are going to come back in style - then this is the guy to use as the lead role in all of them!Without giving too much away, this film was different to what I thought it would be.  The emotions were much different to what I thought they would be.  There is never a dull moment during the two hours or so that it runs for, that much is for certain... so whatever your tastes may be, it is definitely worth a look.	4.0	Come What May...	2001-06-16	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1NQ3055H3CKVB	Mikael Kuoppala	"Rarely have I been as prejudiced about something as I was about ""Moulin Rouge"": an unintellectual love story filled with clich&eacute;s, people dancing in ridiculous costumes and actors singing their own lines, I thought.You can probably guess that I'm not the biggest fan of the musical. However ""Moulin Rouge"" proved to be a huge exeption from that opinion.The movie is directed by Baz Luhrman, who has also co-written it with Craig Pearce. It's not a typical musical but an exeptionally good, two-hour long music video, exept that it works better. It doesn't even try to show reality in a light way; it's pure description of an imaginary reality.""Moulin Rouge"" isn't a typical musical: predictable, irrelevant american movie/theater performance where characters just burst out singing, leading to the realistic plot losing it's credibility, hence making the story a ""musical"". It's just a dreamily unreal world, that you feel like awakening from when the film is over. On top of that the vide variety of musical segments of the film aren't just made up of separate scenes that are forcefully implanted to the story, but are rather the primary method of storytelling.The movie is set in a fantasy world that somewhat resembles Paris and it's erotic cabare, the Moulin Rouge at the dawn of the 20th ceuntury. It's a tragic tale about a british poet and a prostitute, of emotions and the cruelty of the world. It's a tale straight from the romantic era of literature, but it's execution as (post-?)postmodern as it can be.Baz Luhrman's directing is challenging. Artistic and unconventional enough to have made an impression to the experts of art films around the world. Writing isn't so good, but couldn't be any better if it were to fit the film that's full of symbols and dreams, giving no place to dialogue.All the actors do a creat job in bringing their two-dimencional characters to life. They were reportedly instructed to overdo their performances, and if you'll watch ""Moulin Rouge"" you'll understand the reason for that: without overly emotional and melodramatic performances by the actors the characters would drown in the flow of the movie.And I must say that the actors do a creat job in overacting and yet conveying something deep about their purposefully stereotypical characters. Especially Nicole Kidman as the faihfull curtisane Satine manages astonishingly well in that. A lot better than her co-star, too often less-than-perfect Evan McGregor.But the terms used to defy ordinary hollywood films don't apply with this musical. You see, ""Moulin Rouge"" isn't a film with music in it, it's music with a film in it. Sounds corny, but it's true. The idiotically stupid and predictable love-story-combined-with-tragedy-- storyline, wich is all too typical for musicals, doesn't bother at all because you don't even notice it.What comes through is a breathtakingly visual storytelling combined to a working musical complexity. It's like a two hour long educational session about the history of music. The movie carries the viewer through the most well-known pieces of classical music to the hits of today, combining them to a completely functioning musical spectre. Mozart and Nirvana are one. It's all about music, not about certain types of music.How long the various musical performances take of the film's time is hard to estimate, because it's hard to notice the beginnings and ends of the music scenes, if they even exist. This is why the usually so irritating singing of dialogue doesn't bother at all. You don't even notice it, so naturally it's incorporated into the fantasy world of the Moulin Rouge. When the whole movie is like a dream, unrealistic scenes don't matter.On top of this, musical pieces aren't being used as complete tunes; some are heard only for a few beats, sometimes completely separate from any other music. That's why I wasn't afraid of the next overly jovial music scenes as I usually am when watching musicals. Infact, I was even surprised when I realizend one was being performed.The musical scenes also vary radically in terms of tone and color and are everything but just ridiculous entertainment numbers to soften everything that's serious in the story.The visual storytelling of ""Moulin Rouge"" is exeptional. Slow-ups, speed-ups, special effects and experimental photography in complex sets are used to a breathtaking extend. And I must point out that I don't usually pay any attention to the visual quantities of a motion picture. This is mainly because they usually serve only as effects to enforce something else.""Moulan Rouge"", on the other hand, has left predictable plot, well performed but superficial characters and bad dialogue to stand aside. And I don't think the film would have worked any other way. ""Moulin Rouge"" is as good as it could possibly be, think I.But the essence of ""Moulin Rouge"" is the dreamworld created with visual art and music that's bigger than life. It has so much surface it compensates for the complete lack of depht. ""Moulin Rouge"" is... different."	5.0	And I thought I hated musicals...	2002-06-04	7	3	4
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1ED4H8T6NXF9E	Mike and Ike	Moulin Rouge is such a beautiful movie, and it's saddening to think that this is the last of the &quot;Red Curtain&quot; trilogy by Baz Luhrman.  In a style like Strictly Ballroom and Romeo + Juliet, Moulin Rouge tells a story, a tragic in this case, through ways of music.  As for my opinion, I truly loved it because of everything: acting, singing, choreography, story, visuals, everything.  Nicole gives one of best perfomances-this year seems to be Nicole's best, along with The Others-while Ewan plays a charming yet shy character so perfectly.

There are dozens of edits every minute, each unjustified and collectively incoherent.

I would of been innocent back then, age 9, still unkempt and drawing on illogics and faulty imagination to explain why the sun goes up, and then down, or why the sky is blue. Surely now, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; dangles it all in front of me, a neo-masterpiece so overtaken with its self, it pays homage to homages of 1940's music movies. And why shouldn't it? As inventive as cinema can be, as colorful as a bright enigmatic rainbow vehicle, as atrociously addictive and likeable, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; transcends travesty and tragedy itself, breaking barriers from the inside out. Sure, the sets are lavish, the music appreciative, the culture creative, but the feeling of it is like a heart rising out of your body and winking at you. Baz Lurhmann doesn't sing; he yelps glittering gallons of melodramatic hipster hop, redefining cool as yesterday, and savoring every surface of it. Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman spare no less, with intoxicating animosity in their quiet loud emotions. Critics spar between glorious filmmaking and watered-down flashiness, but I'll take the former. This ain't no Betty Boop bonanza that turns on 60 old geezers who are spitting out their dentures. This is musical surreality that turns on everyone with truth, beauty, freedom, and love lunging out of it, grasping, and never letting go.	5.0	Cinematic Magic	2002-08-11	1	0	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1JMQ88IMH0XJL	Mike	"""Moulin Rouge!"" (2001)You may have never liked musicals before. You may have always hated when the characters in a live action film burst into song. I personally always quite enjoyed a not-too-frequent good musical number in a movie, and I haven't seen a great musical film in quite some time. Moulin Rouge! completely restored my faith in modern musicals, and in all good movies for that matter. This is quite simply the best romantic tale ever told, and an amazing odyssey through a visionary director's mind that is not easily forgotten.That director of course is Baz Luhrmann, who has directed such films as Strictly Ballroom in 1992 and Romeo + Juliet in 1996. With Rouge, Luhrmann uses more energy than in any of films. The sheer sense and atmosphere in Rouge is all thanks to a marvellous director who really knows his stuff. Luhrmann is very artistic with the big picture and uses nifty little technical marvels to make the movie even more heart-warming and colourful (an example is of several scenes where the moon smiles down on Christian and Satine while they are dancing to `Our Song').The performances by an all-star cast in the film also provide to the greatness of the movie. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are Christian and Satine, lighting up the screen with their stunning performances. It seems like these 2 actors we're meant for each other, a sign of really getting into your character - these 2 deserve Oscars! And to boot, they both have incredible singing voices. Jim Broadbent is almost equally fantastic as the huge, moustache-twirling Moulin Rouge owner Harold Zidler, and Richard Roxburgh is powerful and engrossing as the Duke, who is also after Satine. John Leguizamo doesn't disappoint on the comic side of things at the beginning, but him and McGregor also have a very powerful dramatic moment near the end.The sets for this movie are what really set it ablaze. From the giant elephant to a windmill of a nightclub, the film is tightly edited and decorated brilliantly to bring the millennium side-story to life. The visual effects are also very good, and very noticeable. You can't really tell their visual effects, but the wizards on this movie used plenty of techniques (exploding colours, mist on rooftops, a brilliant swoop over Paris) to make this look more daring, and more artistic.Unfortunately this may come as a love-it-or-hate-it film to some. Possible reasons people might not like it is because they don't like musicals, they think it was overstylized or possibly even melodramatic. I really loved this movie as you already know. I have no negativity towards musicals, I loved the way the style of the movie was over-the-top and flashy, and the drama was not at all cheesy or corny, it won my heart by using natural scenes and lines.Keep an open mind with Rouge and you'll be fine.Overall, this is my best film of 2001, an overwhelming, sexy, daring, highly anticipated, brilliantly made, with kinetic energy and incredible musical numbers (Come What May is the best film song for the new decade!). I couldn't take my eyes off this movie, and it is one of my personal all-time greats. I might've not said much about this film to make you believe that, but trust me, this is an almost indescribable film, and no amount of adjectives than really sum up how much I loved the movie. See it now!MY GRADE: A+NOTE: If you buy the special-edition VHS you get a great making-of featurette with interviews with the cast and a couple of deleted scenes. It's worth the couple more dollars, trust me!"	5.0	A brilliant romance that revives the musical genre.	2002-04-08	2	1	1

It was great. I didn't believe Nicole Kidman could give such a performance. I still think a stunt-double must have done the acting parts for her.Unfortunately, no amount of polish can make up for the fact that the framework of this film is rotten. The story is completely uninspired. And the songs, well... let's just say I was expecting to hear the cast break out into a Boz Scaggs tune at any time (that's NOT a compliment).It amazes me that anyone could find this film enjoyable, and that is not sarcasm.	1.0	About as bad as bad as it gets	2002-01-09	7	2	5
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AK60ZGW8X9P05	"mikemeg ""mikemeg5"""	"One star for excellent visual creativity.Let me give some caveats:1) If you value visuals above all else, you may enjoy this movie.  The visuals are amazing.2) If you think popular music lyrics are deep, you may enjoy this movie.3) If you get carried away by star power, you may enjoy this movie.Otherwise, stay away.Plot: The plot is trite and trivial.  It's reminiscent of many operas, only in operas thin plots are used as structures on which to hang complex music.  Here, you know within moments how the entire story line will proceed.Music:  Here, the music is complex only insofar as there are many ""samples"" of popular music integrated (and every one done worse that the original).  The complexity does not build in any coherent manner, and merely points out the shallowness of the popular music bites.  If you're going to use popular music, at least use decent popular music.  ""Your Song"" was a relatively good choice, but ""Like a Virgin"" was idiotic-- and they built an entire production number around it.  The two stars-- not singers-- did a good job.  Nicole Kidman sounded a bit like Helen Reddy to me, but Ewen McGregor had a very honest, individual voice.Dialogue: Much of this also comes from popular music.  Enough said.Humor: The first time you hear a character use a line from a 70's hit, it's a bit amusing.  The 80th time it happens, it's clear that the writers had no original thoughts to express.  The boudoir scene was idiotic and predictable, having been done better many times in earlier movies.Actors: I thought they did a very good job.  But skilled, hard-working actors cannot make terrible material into Citizen Kane.  They can, it this case, make it into Showgirls.I can't overemphasize how awful this was, and I had been prepared to enjoy it.  As I mentioned, the visuals were amazing, but they certainly don't carry the movie."	1.0	Just astonishingly horrible	2002-01-25	14	8	6

I liked it a lot.That's not to say that ""Moulin Rouge"" didn't take a bit of getting used to.  Five minutes into the film and I felt my senses being bombarded with frenetic, over-the-top, somewhat hard to follow (and swallow) scenes.  But somehow, through it all, I was able to follow what turns out to be a very simple story line:  two men (one a decent, hard-working, poverty stricken writer, and the other a rich, evil, domineering duke) compete for the affections of the most beautiful woman (a courtesan at the Moulin Rouge, Paris' most decadent and popular show club.)  Poor, good man wins girl's heart; evil rich guy becomes insanely jealous and threatens to close down club if girl doesn't become his; girl is forced to become rich man's lover; Poor, good man becomes despondent... et cetera... et cetera...The story may be familiar to most of us, but the way it's told is certainly the most original I've ever seen.  Every seen is garishly colorful, set at a dizzyingly fast pace, and filled with delightful cartoon-like characters and contrivances.  The acting is above average in most cases, and, in the case of Kidman and McGregor, much more than that.""Moulin Rouge"" is filled with wonderfully produced music.  Most of the score is comprised of pop tunes from the 1970s through the 1990s, so there's not much originality there.  But the song selection is nearly perfect for the story.  Each song is specifically designed to enhance a particular scene, and does so with precision and beauty.  Both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are very good indeed at singing their own songs.THE DVD:  is excellent, and gives viewers plenty of ""bang for the buck!""  This is a two disc package, the first containing the film and a few ""extras,"" and the second containing several hours of bonus material.  An audio CD sampler is also included.  Video and audio quality for all features are first rate all the way.MY VERDICT:  Much to my surprise and delight I found ""Moulin Rouge"" a wonderful two hours of entertainment.  The story line isn't much, but the acting, the energy, the fast pace, and the wildly colorful sets and costumes, and the music make this a film well worth seeing."	4.0	"""Love... and be loved in return."""	2002-02-16	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A258N5V9ATX38H	"Milka ""cat happy"""	".....Nicole Kidman's hair extensions, which outperformed themajority of this woefully inept cast.Genius? High art? Spiritually infused with symbolism? EvidentlyI needed to be drinking something stronger than I was when Ifirst viewed this film. Maybe there was a method behind thefilm's references to absynthe after all.Two things drive a good film:  plot and character. When bothare developed properly and the right actors are chosen, moviemagic occurs. For me, this film had the potential to createmagic, but failed miserably due to a directorial lack of focus andunbelievably poor casting. To be sure, the sets are grand andthe costumes visually stunning. However, the choppy editing,sophomoric musical score and trite story line would have been farmore palatable--and forgivable--had it not been for the deplorableacting.Many reviews have cited Nicole Kidman as the ""sexy"" ""erotic""""passionate"" centerpiece of the film. For me, this tall, skinny,anemic woman with protruding gums and motionless facialfeatures had all the sex appeal of a wet noodle. When I think ofcourtesans, I picture smouldering, voluptuous women whoseeroticism stems from a raw and steely core hardened by worldlyexcess and exploitation. Women who are a bit rough around the edges.Kidman and Luhrmann needed to take a page out of Jessica Rabbit'sbook and watch Dr. Frank N. Furter come down the elevator shaft a fewtimes before fashioning Kidman's high class [...], who was too busylooking ""pretty"" on a swing to truly afford the character any depth or soul.Adding to Satine's lack of proper characterization is Kidman's lousyacting. Her performance first begins to completely unravel during the""Rhythm of the Night"" scene, in which she awkwardly chirps, trills, andtrapses around the club shaking her ostrich feathers in the face of thelead. It's hard to determine just who she's channeling here, but it appearsto be a combination of Carmen Miranda, Gloria Estefan, and Lucille Ballon crack. The film unravels further as she rolls around on the floor in somefake, cheesy, orgasmic trance as Ewan McGregor recites cliched lines from""Your Song,"" which supposedly send her into some freakish sexual frenzy.(At this point in the film her accent is quasi-American but will morph intosomething like British later in the film).Continuing scenes are intermittantly punctuated by a lot of fake hacking andcoughing and breaking out into song, which showcases a weak voice by traditionalblockbuster musical standards. (In other words, your not gonna get the goosebumps that break out when you hear Jennifer Hudson sing.) After a few extremelycontrived crying scenes at the end of the film (one of which must have relied onglycerine and amonia), Kidman pulls out a dying scene so ridiculous and prolongedthat I thought the protagonist was going to die before she did (there's a cinematicopportunity that was missed!). The only dying scene that rivals the cheesiness ofKidman's death in Moulin Rouge! is Sophia Coppola dying in Godfather III. Folks,it's that bad.Ewan McGregor as the lovestruck poet is not entirely terrible, but he'snot spectacular either. Throughout the film, the young man in the monkeysuit attempts to win the affections of Kidman's holy [...] (archetypes,people, archetypes) with trite endearments such as.....breaking into song.His vocal talents are a bit stronger than Kidman's, although the delivery issomewhat flat. While I truly do feel his anguish at the end of the film whenSatine chokes out her last breath, I do not witness the incredible chemistrybetween the two actors so many others do. For example, at the crescendo ofthe ""Elephant Medley"" when the two are facing each other in the entrance tothe, umm, ""Elephant Room,"" their hands are at their sides while they're singing!At a moment when both lovers needed to passionately embrace at thecompletion of a very important medley that tells their ""STORY,"" the actorswere too busy concentrating on hitting the high notes of the songs to staycompletely in character. Knitpicky, you say? For me, this obvious oversightepitomizes the lack of passion and chemistry between the two throughout thefilm. They do not, by any means, raise the room temperature with their sizzle.As for John Leguizamo's midget artist with a speech impediment,I found the performance goofy and embarrassing. All anyone cando is pray that his ""To Wong Foo"" days are not completely over andthat he hasn't completely degenerated to just a second rate supportinggoon in high budget disasters like this one.For those of you still on the fence about seeing this movie, I heartilyrecommend you do. A film that invites this much discussion andpassionate debate is worth seeing, if for no other reason than tobecome part of the ongoing dialogue. Is this film phenomenal? Hardly.Did it deserve an Oscar? Please. Do the lead actors do the story, setsand costumes justice? No. Did it convince many members of film-goingaudiences over the last seven years that all they need is love? Allegedly.And while it is my contention that other films have done a far better jobof packaging and selling the ""love"" construction, Moulin Rouge! retains aheavily-contested yet no less viable place in the ongoing conversationof how it should appear on screen."	1.0	And the star goes to.....	2008-06-23	8	3	5
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3CVR9TEFFJZX4	mini nic	Moulin Rouge, what a fantastic movie. It was wonderful from start to finish. Everything about this movie is great. The actors are fabulous. Ewan Mcgregor, when he started to sing 'Your Song' it's enough to make you weak in the knees. He has a beautiful voice and should consider doing more musicals. Nicole Kidman, this is one of her best performances yet. She is so beautiful in this movie. And her singing voice, wow! I can't see why Moulin Rouge was so overlooked at last years Oscars when this year Chicago took almost every award it was nominated for. But anyway, Moulin Rouge is one of the best movies around right now and I highly recomend it. The dvd is worth every cent. It's filled with extras and some scenes cut from the film.

In my experience Hollywood botches it good; especially when the first film was a smash hit.  That said, I went in expecting a mediocre film and got blown away.The strength of this film is not only in the love energy between our star crossed lovers, but, additionally, in the humorous mix of contemporary music (i.e. Madonna's LIKE A VIRGIN; Sting's ROXANNE; THE LIFT IS UP WHERE WE BELONG (not sure if that's the title); IN THE NAME OF LOVE; etc).Expect zany style humor with a great deal going off to the sides.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AOQ6H9V842PCG	Misty Haberer	Everytime I watch this movie I find a new nuance, a subtle meaning carefully orchestrated by genius Baz Luhrman.  Granted, if musicals aren't your thing this movie might fly right over your head.  But for those who love pure artistic beauty and the fantasy we all wish we could find in real life, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The orchestration of familiar songs is unbelievable, and the voices of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, while obviously not professional, are perfect for the roles.  This movie swings between the hilarious (Spectacular, Spectacular), the starkly dramatic (Roxanne) and the heartbreakingly tragic (What May Come).  You'll come out of it feeling like you've been on a 2 hour roller coaster, but any ensemble of artists who can turn a one dimensional screen into this unbelievable 3-D melange of color, sound, and dance is definitely worth the ride.  The fact the story itself it a bit unrealistic is entirely inconsequential.  Anyone who sits through a movie simply to find more of the reality they live every day is entirely missing the point of entertainment.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AKJ9MEE93DG5O	mitchell5954	Moulin Rouge is a classic example of style over substance.  The film has great production values and good dancing, but has nothing else to offer.  Many people seem to get so sucked up in the style of the movie that they fail to realize all the glaring flaws in terms of characters and story.Moulin Rouge is a movie musical that came out in 2001.  This is the film that is said to restore the movie musical.  It stars Christian, plated by Ewan McGregor and Satine played by Nicole Kidman.  The movie revolves around their love story and how they are going to prevent the Moulin Rouge from closing down.The characters are one of the big problems with the film.  The characters are very one-dimensional, even if the movie tries to show you otherwise.  Most of the movie revolves around showing how much Christian and Satine are in love even though they have no real chemistry in my opinion.  They never really have a conversation about anything other than about love.  They never have a normal conversation discussing their likes, dislikes, what they have in common, etc.  The side cast is entirely forgettable for the most part.  The villain is the very over-the-top.  He is basically a one-dimensional mustache-twirler.  There is nothing at all deep about any of the characters.As I mentioned earlier, the production values in this film are beautiful.  The dance sequences are also impressive.  The songs themselves are good, but are completely out of place in this setting.  The film takes place in 1899, but these songs are all from the 1990s.  This contradiction takes you out of the film.Overall I cannot recommend this.  If you are looking for a good movie musical there are many films that are better like, Chicago, Les Miserable, Sound of Music, Sweeney Todd, etc.  I respect it for bringing back the movie musical, but as a film by itself, it does hold up.	2.0	Eye Candy and Nothing More!	2013-05-04	4	2	2

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2VUO3Z9WDPFLH	mk	I can barely *put down in words* how extraordinary this movie is. Ewan McGregor has such an amazing voice and proves how terrific of an actor and he is.  And he's cute too!  Nicole Kidman is excellent as Satine, a courtesan at the Moulin Rouge.  She can sing well, too (but let's face it, next to Ewan, it's tough to be that great!!!)  They have such * spectacular * chemistry and whenever they are on the screen together, it just makes you smile.  Ewan singing &quot;Your Song&quot; to her is just such a good scene, he's so adorable.Besides the main love story, this movie is filled with hilarious parodies of popular songs, such as Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and Madonna's &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;.  If the &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;.  If that scene at least doesn't make you laugh, then I just don't know...Richard Roxbourgh plays the evil Duke, and man, do you just hate him after the movie! He is very, very convincing as a possessive, neurotic, evil character and definitely brings a very evil element to this movie.The music in this movie is just so wonderful.  As I mentioned, Ewan McGregor is an extremely talented singer, and he sings a lot in the movie!  It's truly a unique experience in the movie theater.  I'm not guaranteeing that this movie is for everyone.  But it is at least an experience.  Whether it is good or bad, I leave to you! For me, it was one of the best experiences of my life!	5.0	Moulin Rouge.... it just takes your breath away....	2001-09-24	3	2	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3RIOFXYA0COFV	Mlle. A	If you see any movie this month- or this year, for that matter, make it Moulin Rouge. This is a sophisticated, fun, visually stunning, overall GORGEOUS movie. The story is elegant... during several parts of the movie it reminded me of the love story between Jack and Rose from &quot;Titanic&quot;: simple and beautiful. It really works well to tie this film together. The actors were incredible. I had my doubts about Nicole Kidman at first, but she was perfect for the role. I can't imagine any other actress that would suit the part better. Ewan McGregor was also perfect... like Nicole, he showed just the right amount of charisma and charm in the movie. All of the actors sing in the movie, which also had me worried before I saw the film but their voices proved worthy and blended well with the feel of the movie. The costumes and sets are incredible, they truly make you feel that you are in France at the Moulin Rouge 100 years ago. The only disappointing part of this movie is the fact that not as many people are appreciating it as I had hoped: sadly, it's already below the top 5 in the box office. I can understand that in a world of untalented teen movie stars and shallow story- lines that a deeper, more substantial movie like Moulin Rouge may scare away many. Moulin Rouge is definitely a movie for sophisticated audiences with a taste for quality actors, a good story, and stunning visuals. It can easily be compared to a Broadway musical- not just because it is a musical, but because it was made with the talent and the care and the hard work that it takes to produce a Broadway show. This movie is definitely worth a try, and if you're like me you'll want to go back a second, third, fourth... time to see it again. Don't let this movie pass you by because it's absolutely SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR!	5.0	Spectacular!	2001-06-16	0	0	0

It is fast-paced, beautiful, and amazingly put together.  The best way to describe Baz's style in this film is &quot;Impressionist&quot;.  He has a way of making all the scenes flow together beautifully while still keeping the basic plot going.This movie is obviously a love story between Christian(Ewan McGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman), both of whom play their roles perfectly.  McGregor gives his usual stellar performance, showing his chameleon-like acting abilities off to perfection.  Kidman shows a rare display of fun and lightness in her acting style.

I personally adored this movie. Ewan McGregor (in my opinion one of the best actors of his generation) and Nicole Kidman (who before this I had grossly underrated) are right on target. The chemistry between them is electric, as is the rest of the film.Though the Moulin Rouge is more of a dark, hellish place than an actual night club, it pulses with life, color and excitement. The world that Baz Lurhmann created is unimagineable, and the music is woven into the movie with flare and style. The soundtrack has everything from a heart-wrenching original song to an out-of-the-blue rendition of ""Smells like Teen Spirit"".The supporting players also delivered top notch performances, Jim Broadbent as the electrifying Harold Zidler, John Leguizamo as the endearing, odd Toulouse Lautrec and Richard Roxburgh as the extraordinarly evil and weak Duke.Overall, I thought Moulin Rouge was ""spectacular spectacular,"" beautifully done, fantastic characters (if not a few too many cliches) and acting at its best.

It is, the first time, because you miss a lot of the little details that glue the entire movie together. Most of the people who disliked this movie, and found it plotless, just didn't understand the movie, I think.It has a wonderful plot, but if it's your first time seeing it, you'll probably miss a lot of it. It's a fairly simple plot really, about a high-paid courtesan and a penniless poet. They fall in love, and the penniless poet must save his love from the 'Underworld'. You have to watch it. You may have to watch it twice. But I guarentee that once you understand all that's going on (not just the &quot;big picture&quot;) you'll realize how wonderful the movie truly is.BAZ IS GOD!(Not to mention the wonderful eye candy presented by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, both of which have beautiful singing voices and do some award-winning acting in this movie.)	5.0	You Have To Watch It Twice...	2002-07-26	0	0	0

The best art is that which sparks controversy, and this one has to be one of the most controversial pieces of art from the movie industry. I've noticed that pretty much all the bad reviews were from men so I'm guessing they can't stand the fact that this film was made to be that, a film. Moulin Rouge wanted the boundry between the audience and the story to be prominent- sometimes pulling you in just to push you right back out-toying with the audience. Films that are strong enough to do this are amazing to watch emotionaly.	5.0	new and different	2002-04-05	0	0	0

All of the actors and actresses are amazing, and are incredibly believable.  The plot of Moulin Rouge is that a poor writer (Christian, played wonderfully by Ewan McGregor,) has come to Paris to write about ""truth, beauty, and which he believed above all things, love.""  The problem?  He's never been in love!...Luckily, Christian meets a group of Bohemians who live above him and are so impressed by his writing talents that they ask him to write a musical called ""Spectacular Spectacular"" for the Moulin Rouge's show.  Christian agrees, and they all go to the Moulin Rouge to see the owner, Harold Zidler, (Jim Broadbent,) about the show.  At the Moulin Rouge, Christian sees Satine (Nicole Kidman) and falls in love with her.  The only problem is that Satine has to pretend that she is in love with the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) in order for the Duke to finacially support their show.  Christian and Satine have to hide their love from the Duke.  The Duke eventually catches on, gets jealous, and tells Satine that if she stays with Christian, he will have Christian killed.  I don't want to give away any more, but I will tell you that there are lots of twists and turns, and a BIG thing that I didn't put in my review.  The acting (and singing!) in this movie are SIMPLY AMAZING!...  Ewan McGregor can sing SO WELL!!!  His voice is just beautiful.  His acting is also SUPERB, and he is totally believable.  Nicole Kidman also sizzles on screen!!!  She brings it all out - the acting, singing, dancing, crying.  Her comedic timing is also very sharp.  Nicole Kidman's acting is just...AMAZING!...Her singing is also great, and she puts alot of acting into her singing.  And all of the supporting characters (Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxburgh, and John Leguizamo,)are wonderful, and they really make this movie work.  As for the director, Baz Luhrman, what can I say???  Baz Luhrman is SPECTACULAR!!!  I am so much in awe of him.In conclusion, if you like great acting, singing, and a great story line, you will LOVE Moulin Rouge.  Moulin Rouge is a movie which is entertaining, sad, and even a little funny at times.  (Referring to the ""Like a Virgin"" scene.)

Ewan McGregor, Jim Broadbent, and Nicole's Kidman's performances are spectacular! I had no idea McGregor could sing so well! This movie has more color, beauty, and joy than any other movie I have ever seen. I could hardly contain myself. I wasn't prepared for this movie. When I first saw it, I was like a rich little kid in a candy store. I couldn't blink. The duet between Ewan and Nicole in the elephant is absolutely triumphant! I have no problem at all with the movie borrowing songs from various famous musicians; I would consider the manner in which they are presented nothing but flattering. Ba Luhrmann did a fantastic job directing this movie. The dances are wonderfully choreographed, and the fanatically frantic onslaught of quick cuts provides high, awesome energy. All you need to know about the plot is that Ewan McGregor is a romantic playwright looking for his first big hit, and once he coincidentally gets his shot, the movie takes off like a rocket into space.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2AN5SVFKB3HV8	Mr. Andrew Pleydell	Original and challenging, it deserves repeated viewing. As Kidman herself recognised, it's not for everyone, so why does every malcontent with a grievance insist on (unhelpfully) telling us how they failed to join in the fun and did little more than regret the emptying of their popcorn containers half way through? It may not be entirely successful, but bloody hell, I'd rather spend my money on something that took a real risk in this world of the generic and in the case of this movie wore its heart on its sleeve and recognised that a story about the past produced at the turn of the next millenium was going to be influenced by the culture (and pop-culture) of its own era. What's more, the Like a Virgin sequence, among others for that matter, is absolute inspired lunacy! For a moment I didn't know whether to be repulsed or to laugh. I chose the latter - but at least I was given the choice. And there are so many moments when the serious is juxtaposed or even expressed with apparent sincerity through material that seems curiously at odds with the seriousness of the drama. While the story line may be simplistic, no denial there, the role that the audience is meant to play in this piece is a complex and finally gratifying one. Thanks Baz for suggesting that as a film goer I do have something to bring into the cinema other than my wallet and bags of annoyingly distracting &quot;munchies&quot;. We'll be talking about this film long after many other &quot;worthy&quot; efforts have finished their reruns on pay TV. Terrific, would love to see more from this director. In all an honest film that highlights, rather than slyly disguises its artificiality and that of the musical; and of the motion picture for that matter.NB. The DVD extras are the best you'll see anywhere.	5.0	A movie that asks, &quot;What do you want in a movie?&quot;	2002-01-10	8	5	3
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	Anyone who had watched Australian director Baz Luhrman's previous two films were doubtless highly anticipating his third film 'Moulin Rouge'.  It's a brash and colourful assault on the sound and the senses.  Beautiful, camp and tragic, 'Moulin Rouge' swept up at the box office and revived what everyone thought was a dead genre.Ewan McGreggor and Nicole Kidman play leading roles as the poor song writer and the gorgeous courtesan.  He loves her but she is bound to a rich and evil lord in order to both jumpstart her acting career and save the Moulin Rouge from bankruptcy.  Kidman as Satine is fantastic, with McGreggor hardly worse and Jim Broadbent as the head of the Moulin Rouge itself being great too.  Although the story itself is riddled with clich&eacute;s and plot-holes, it's so utterly mesmerising that you can't fail to be taken in.  It's also one of those few films that makes you pay attention to its choreography and music, both of which are the best to be seen in any film released in the past year.The leads' vocals are stupendous, with Kidman later furthering her talents by attaining an English Christmas Number 1 with Robbie Williams and the song 'Something Stupid'.  The dance scenes in the Moulin Rouge are equally fantastic, with many people calling attention to the 'Roxanne' sequence.  However, there are other scenes which can only be described as magical, such as the medley of songs that McGreggor uses to serenade Kidman in her room (a huge white china elephant).  Visually this is beautiful, and this combines well with a collection of recent pop hits such as Elton John's 'Your Song' and 'Lady Marmalade' by Christina Aguilera and co.Whichever way you look at it, this is a winner and its biggest success is appealing a whole new generation to musicals by bringing them into the 21st century with style.	5.0	Fascinatingly spectacular	2001-12-24	2	1	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2ZA3LSJZD9UO0	Mr G Bowden	"""Moulin Rouge"" marks the return of Baz Luhrmann, the man who made Shaekspeare hip for the MTV generation with ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"". Whilst he has a lot to answer for in terms of his influence on how Shakespeare has since been portrayed (I recently saw a production of ""Othello"" that played the Pretenders' ""Don't Get Me Wrong"" seventeen times before the play began), with ""Moulin Rouge"" he gives us a full-blooded, intoxicatingly frenetic reminder of why the moviegoing public swooned in the first place. Infusing the classy tragic lovestory trappings of the melodramatic musical with twentieth century love songs, the result is an all-out riot.The setting is nineteenth century Paris at the infamous Moulin Rouge club, made so for its penchant for pantie-less can-can dancers. Luhrmann, however, throws every modern filmmaking trick into the book to free up a risque bohemian spirit that spreads itself throughout the film in a massive chaotic sweep. Everything is increasingly weird and wonderful to behold, from the giant elephant that holds home to Nicole Kidman to the deceptively huge nightclub itself. And the musical numbers are wonderfully performed as well as being very witty; revelations include an early floorshow mix of ""Lady Marmalade"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and Kidman and Ewan McGregor's ""Elephant Love Medley"", a bold medley of classic songs that could have gone terribly wrong. It is a testament to Luhrmann and his team that they never ever do.Performances all around are faultless. Kidman and McGregor throw themselves into the film mercilessly, at first appearing as deranged and gaudy as the caricatures around them, until the film's second act shifts into darker dramatic territory and they are required to deliver the goods. Kidman does so with gusto, earning the majority of the scenes and some truly ravishing costumes, but McGregor is just as wonderful, and the finale couldn't have packed any punch that it has without him. Standouts from the supporting cast include Jim Broadbent, possibly the best British actor around (an Oscar nomination please!), and Richard Roxburgh as the shy-but-villainous Duke.The only real problem is that ""Moulin Rouge"" has an acquired taste: whilst it marries the absinthe-strewn freakishness well with the timeless musical qualities very well, they are still two disparate elements that some people won't wholly register with. People I know have remarked ""Oh it was so good, but it was really weird in places"" whilst others have said ""It was really funny and witty but the romantic bits were slow and boring"". One noted male remark that I found funny was: ""That movie is so gay, man!"" But what ""Moulin Rouge"" serves up is so unlike anything around, and should be praised for that, especially in a season of redundant sequels and remakes. Cult Classic status beckons."	4.0	One of the Genuine Gems of 2001!	2001-12-02	16	14	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A281GDKH25ZBRX	Mr. Music Man	I LOVE THIS MOVIE.When i first rented it I only bought it because of the video to Lady Marmalade. How simple was that? Well i watched the video and was satisfied and was just gonna send the movie back. But then I decided to watch it. I was blown away by the first dance scene in which Christian first goes to Moulin Rouge and how they put that together! I love that scene and all of the music/dance scenes in the movie. I cried so bad at the end! I truly felt for Christian. I finally got this movie from a friend who said she didn't like it. How could that be but i guess it's not for everyone. My sister even says it was weird until she got into it and my niece really likes it also and she's only 8! She just loves the dancing in the movie by the girls. The acting, singing, music and feeling are genuine and I wish more movies were like this one.So I finally own this SPECTAULAR two-disc set! I have also found a couple of easter eggs on the second disc. They only have a little scene they play but i think it's cute because they are in the shape of the green fairy.Some special features i really like are:The music video for COME WHAT MAY very cool techno beat to it.The music video for LADY MARMALADE which features Missy Elliott.The extended dance sequences (especially The Can-Can)The first rehearsals for the dance sequences (which features a very funny rehearsal for Like A Virgin)The photo galleriesAll in all i love this movie and the extra stuff and i thank my friend Stacy for giving this DVD to me.	5.0	The greatest thing you'll ever watch.	2005-06-23	5	4	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1YHKSTVSYEYTU	Mr. N. Carnegie	"How often do you go to see a movie and come out feeling your expectations have been exceeded? It probably only happens to me once or twice a year and I love watching movies. In my opinion this was the first of only two truly great movies in 2001 (The Fellowship of The Ring was the other).Baz Luhrmann's spectacular movie is a new spin on old idea - the movie musical. From the opening set-piece at the Moulin Rouge, an amazing set-piece of complex choreography, involving a cast of hundreds singing and dancing to a sequence of pop/rock ""classics"", including such diverse songs as Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and Madonna's ""Material Girl"" seamlessly segued together, Moulin Rouge is nothing short of wonderful. Original (with a capital O) from the opening credits to the closing credits, this is in my humble opinion, nothing short of genius.""But what's the plot I hear you cry?"" Well, without trying to give too much away ... a young writer by the name of Christian (Ewan Mc.Gregor)arrives in Paris in search of inspiration which inevitably leads him to the Moulin Rouge. There he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman), an elegant courtesan and the star of attraction of the Moulin Rouge, who mistakes the young writer for the very rich Duke of Worcester - cue innuendos galore - and Christian and Satine fall in love. But of course their love is not without complication, as Satine's affections have already been promised to the Duke and the lovers have to embark on a secret love affair...Maybe it does favour style over substance but hey, hasn't it got STYLE!!! This is pop culture at it's finest, wonderfully brash, fantastically OTT and nothing like anything you have ever seen before. Ewan Mc.gregor and Nicole Kidman light up the screen with sexual chemistry, great acting and unexpectedly good voices. And if the Academy has any taste (which is certainly debateable) this should be a winner of something major at the Oscars.PS The extras for the DVD are (unlike many other DVD's) superb and well worth seeing!"	5.0	ONE OF 2001's TWO GREATEST MOVIES!	2002-02-06	4	3	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1OTT4RMGUY17O	Mr. Richard F. Herndon Sr.	My wife and I lasted about 1/2 hour into this movie before turning it off.  It's a story based in late 19th century Paris, and focuses on the Bohemian dance hall scene.  Characters include Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and other historical figures.  My problem with the movie is that the music is not contemporaneous to the time and place.  The songs are modern, i.e., rock music, and this doesn't work well.  Further, the lip-synching is poorly done.  There are also fantasy-based special effects that seem out of place, such as a glittery fireworks display.If you are really open to this kind of thing, you might enjoy Moulin Rouge, but if you are expecting a historically accurate musical film, you'll be in for a not too pleasant surprise.

We noticed so many problems with editing, script, song choices,  and voice overs for all the songs we ceased to care about the beautiful sets, actors and costumes.  We wanted it to be fun and waited for it to be fun, but  ultimately felt that our tastes, senses and intelligence had been insulted.

This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The style of this film is quirky in the extreme and the camera work can leave you dizzy but nevertheless this film has you gripped from the first frame to the last. It is a basic love story centring on a courtesan, Satine, who falls for penniless writer, Christian. Meanwhile, a rich English Duke is determined to possess Satine whatever the cost.Moulin Rouge is a vibrant kaleidoscope of colour and movement set to music that just shouldn't work but thanks to some really clever arranging it does. The scene where Zidler and the Duke perform their version of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' is hilarious. There are many well-known songs throughout the film, but all are given a new slant and performed in a unique way.The main stars are Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman and there is an on screen chemistry between them that makes their characters relationship believable. What's more they can sing...not something either was known for prior to this. The ever-talented Jim Broadbent stars as Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge and Richard Roxburgh is the Duke.This DVD set has a wealth of extras, enough to keep anyone occupied for hours and there are many, many hidden extras for those who like hunting.

Sappy love movies are not my thing. I have to admit that I didn't hate it as much as I thought I was going to, but I could have lived without Ewan McGregor being such a whiny sap and while we're being honest, Nicole Kidman should, like most of the rest of us, limit her singing to the car and the shower. She doesn't have a bad voice, just not one I would go out of my way to hear. There were three good things about this movie. 1. John Leguizamo, who has yet to suck in anything I've seen him in, including Summer of Sam, 2. Jim Broadbent, who is absolutely BRILLIANT and 3. Jacek Koman's rendition of The Police hit 'Roxanne' in a mass tango. Tangos done right are spectacular and this one is by far the best I've seen on film.

It's not gonna do anything like that for you.  When I say interesting, I mean it is a wholly exciting and interesting concept of a movie, the likes of which I definitely did not see coming when I first popped it in my DVD player.  My mom was the one who told me that I would like this movie, an' I was willing to go along an' watch it even though I had my doubts.  Okay, lemme quit lyin' to y'all, I was TOTTALLY and UTTERLY against watching this movie.  I had absolutely NO desire at all to sit through what looked to me like a big, flashy, overblown, feature-length music video with actors and actresses that I didn't even really care for too much (aside from John Leguizamo).  It didn't help either that it was under the helm of eccentric director Baz Luhrmann, whose take on 'Romeo &amp; Juliet' was I thought one of the most thoughtless, ridiculous and insignificant movies of recent years (I didn't see 'Strictly Ballroom' so I can't comment on that one).Okay, so it's safe to say I was anything but thrilled about the notion of watching this movie.  What I found when I finally swallowed my pride and watched it was that, well, I was wrong and way too quick to judge.  Okay, it's flashy, it's flamboyant, and it DEFINITELY requires a LOT of suspension of disbelief on the viewers' parts.  But, there is something really special at the heart of this movie with it's simple love story centered around a poor writer's insatiable love for the star dancer, who is basically unattainable unless the price is right.  During a chance encounter, the details of which are too funny to spoil, the poor writer feels that they shared something special together.  Though she denies it at first, she felt it too.  Both believe deeply in their love, but can't find a way to overcome the obstacles between them.  She is promised to marry someone else and he, well, he's poor.  And has no clout.  Hearing songs by Elton John and John Lennon and numerous other contemporary artists as the soundtrack for a story set in 1890's Paris with everything from beautiful-looking theaters to an array of can-can dancers to the dwarf artist Toulouse-Lautrec, played by JOhn Leguizamo, who is an amazingly talented and underrated actor and performer.  The highlight for me was definitely seeing the ringmaster, played by Jim Broadbent, and the dastardly Duke, played by Richard Roxburg, sing 'Like a Virgin'.  That was absolutely hilarious.All I can say is, if you haven't seen 'Moulin Rouge', you're really missing out.  This is Nicole Kidman's best role ever.	5.0	Interesting, very, very interesting...	2002-10-05	7	5	2

'Moulin Rouge' is the story of a young writer named Christian (Ewan McGregor) trying to get a break in 1899 Paris. The focus of the Bohemian community in which he resides, is a nightclub called the M'oulin Rouge,' where Satine (Nicole Kidman) is a dancing courtesan that wishes to become a great actress, but suffers from a serious disease. The great switch of the 'Moulin Rouge' from nightclub to theater is dependent on a duke's (Richard Roxburgh) financing. A comical sequence of events leads to Christian and Satine falling in love, but being put under enormous pressure, as the financing of the theater conversion is dependent upon Satine remaining the mistress of The Duke. 'Moulin Rouge' is built on a very simple, almost Shakespearean plot, but with the addition of Baz Luhrmann's touches, is made into so much more.One's first impression of 'Moulin Rouge' is that of a passionate assault on the viewer's senses. Bright, vivid colors, intricate sets, skillfully designed costumes, incredible music and songs, are all carefully shaped by the director into a magnificent example of how well the medium of film can be used to enhance a musical. Despite 'Moulin Rouge's lackluster reception by cinema audiences, the quality remains there waiting for the viewer to discover. It should be noted that many of the current film-going generation have never seen a musical and that lack of experience may have lead to a souring of their tastes for the film. The recent success of subsequent Hollywood musical adaptions suggests that this attitude is no longer so prevalent and it is likely that if 'Moulin Rouge' had premiered in this environment, it would have received a great deal more praise from critics and audiences alike. In spite of these issues, director Baz Luhrmann has handed down to the film-going public a movie which takes the best aspects of a musical, with the best aspects of motion pictures, to create something very special and worthy of close inspection by those who appreciate either a musical or a stylistically magnificent movie.Little known, but very important in understanding why 'Moulin Rouge' came into being is Baz Luhrmann's loose trilogy of films, exploring the various methods of expression in films, other than traditional dialogue.Strictly Ballroomwas the first in the series from Luhrmann and dealt with the expressive qualities of dance. Audiences failed to latch onto this en masse, but it carved for itself a very specific and important niche in modern cinematic history. In 1996 Luhrmann explored poetry and prose as methods of expression for his actors in his retelling of Shakespeare's classic, and perennial Hollywood favorite,William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet (Special Edition), albeit with some of the modern adaptions to the classic storyline that fans of Luhrmann have come to expect from him. The final installment of the series is the great leap into the realm of music and song, and comes from a more mature and experienced director, leading to a seamless weaving of a classic storyline, with breathtaking sets and visual style, an amazingly perfect ensemble of actors and musicians, and an absolutely unbelieveable soundtrack to create nothing less than the greatest filmed musical since the 1960s.	5.0	A gorgeous creation	2007-11-28	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AUH36NUNBVII8	"Negombo ""Lo"""	"I thought this was going to be a good movie - I'm glad I waited to see it - instead of paying for it I saw it inflight on the way back from Tokyo. I watched it for a few minutes with the sound off (couldn't find the headphones) and even with the sound off, the garish colors were bugging the hell out of my eyes. I watched a few minutes of Nicole Kidman singing ""Diamonds are a girl's best friend"" before switching to another channel. I thought I was going to be transported to some sort of Moulin Rouge experience in the Paris of the 1800's, and all I got was an ignoramus version of a Gen-X history lesson, with too much snappy editiing and the poorest choices of music you could imagine for a period piece. I actually know a guy who did some artistic direction on this movie, and he apparently thinks it's great. I also know that he smokes a lot of pot, so maybe that's why. In my opinion, this is the most overrated crap to come out of Australia since Yahoo Serious.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A33W8OV83FST94	New Pumpkin Patches in the Dawn	I know that so many people see this movie as about spiritualism and art and I want to add my two cents to the debate. That may be true but the love story itself says it all. When Satine sings at the beginning of the film she is yearing for Christian but doesn't have a name for it. Christian is yearing for Satine but doesn't know true love until he meets her. Enter the Duke. Satine must perform for him but the secret song is sung for Christian. The moral of the story is that sometimes when we feel or say or do or sing we aren't sure for whom until we find the true object of our affections. Then and only then can we name it. That is why the people saying the music is no good are just missing the point. The music is not the point but the singing of it to the special person we love. And just like the world would think the Duke was a strong and powerful man and Christian a fool the world thinks pop songs are just plain stupid. Sometimes the world is wrong. Just what we used to think isn't. Satine realizes that her ideal of a Duke type lover was wrong. Get over it people! The music is supposed to be dumb. Just as dumb as demanding that musical theatre must try to imitate Verdi or something or die as a flimsy American pseudo attempt at opera.	5.0	Missing the point	2005-03-05	3	3	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AW1D6P2T7TF4	Nick G	Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a writer in Paris and fate gives him the opportunity to write his first major masterpiece, his fate being an Argentinean man crashing through his ceiling followed by a dwarf (John Leguizamo).  It seems the two men were rehearsing for a play they are putting together with hopes to bring to the sexy Satine (Nicole Kidman) a dancer at Moulin Rouge.  As the two men rehearse, the dwarf explains his buddy suffers from narcolepsy and they need a new lead and Christian is the man to fill his shoes, the only glitch in the play is they can't seem to finish one song, and when Christian adds the lyrics they need they put into action a plan to invade Moulin Rouge and present the play to Satine.With hopes of being a real actress, Satine is quickly drawn to the play, the only problem is The Duke, a man set out to buy the Moulin Rouge and make Satine his property.Can Christian and Satine put on the show of their dreams? Can Christian and Satine enjoy the love that's in their hearts? And, can they stop the evil Duke? Through song and dance we will find the answer to all these questions.`Moulin Rouge' is unlike anything you have ever seen.  Visually stunning, and artistically a masterpiece the film breaks new ground to combine love, music, dance, and the sexy setting of a high-end bordello in 1899 Paris.Ewan McGregor turns in another fine performance as the tortured writer held captive by his love for Satine, and Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances as the singer/dancer/&quot;entertainer&quot;.Incorporating vivid sets, sharp editing, and modern songs `Moulin Rouge' manages to create a Paris of wonder and excitement, one that viewers will be entranced by.Nick Gonnella	4.0	Visually stunning, and entertaining	2001-12-23	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A97B72F4UI8FA	Nick	While Lady Marmalade was only used as a marketing ploy to lure viewers to see this movie, this movie is so much more.  Its a love story with tons of great music numbers and productions that will blow you away.  I myself am not a musicals fan- in fact, the only other one i can tolerate is my favorite movie of 2000, Dancer in the Dark.  This movie is so offbeat and so indie-like, i'm very confused on why it made so much.  Maybe mainstream America does have a little taste left.  This is definately the best movie of the year, and its a shame the academy will split their vote between the Others and this one. This role for Nicole is most definately more demanding and dynamic, and showcases her singing talent.  Someone get this woman a record deal! She can sing!  Especially when she sings &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot;.  Its absolutely breathtaking.  Anyone who has a love for any movie, or what movies should be all about, check this movie out.  It is brilliantly directed by Baz Luhrman, and when he makes another movie i'll be the first in line to see it.  Just see this, even if it is just to say you saw it, because the whole movie is like an experience. 2 hours of pure bliss.  Best movie, along with Memento, to come out this year.	5.0	Best Movie of the Year	2001-12-25	4	4	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3GK89GD5OFK0Q	"""nickrage"""	"To begin, I went into the theater with extremely high expectations of this film, in hopes that I would leave the theater with a smile upon my face and a feeling of satisfaction for the months I have been waiting to see this film.  All dreams and expectations were fulfilled in the two hours which I sat in the theater.  From the first frame to the final image of the curtain and the conductor I sat in awe and silence as the movie enveloped me into its world.  In left the theater in a hurry to go and see if I could sneak into another theater to see it again.  In short, this is a true masterpiece.  Baz Luhrmann, of Romeo + Juliet fame, here introduces us to his own Romeo (Christian) and Juliet (Satine) the sparkling diamond in the crown that is the Moulin Rouge.  The film begins with Christian, a young writer, leaving his home in England and going to Paris to live the bohemian lifestyle.  Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all things Love.  Soon we are introduced to Toulouse-Lautrec (Leguizamo), a midget who is also an actor and seeker of the bohemian revolution.  As the show goes on we learn how Lautrec was hired with his troop to write a show for the Moulin Rogue.  However, when Christian is asked to assist in the production, the writer leaves and Christian is left as the sole writer.  Soon after, the group of men go to the Moulin Rouge gentlemen's-club of sorts, where they meet up with Zidler, the manager of the club.  This opening shot of the club is the first visceral onslaught of many.  It is a wild tornado of sweeping camera shots and fluid shots which come together in a bit of a mess, but by the end of the film one becomes use to Luhrmann's nutty styles and artistic choices.  When the first dance is over, Satine descends from the ceiling and so begins the tale of mistaken identity, where Satine thinks that the Duke, who is the man who will be paying to transform the Moulin Rouge into a theater, is actually Christian.  From this point on the film begins to show us how one can have comedy and drama exist in perfect harmony.  The film goes on in a roller coaster ride of sorts, twisting and turning and through it all we sit back, enjoy, smile, frown, and are relived in the end, yet, like any good roller coaster, we want to go back again.  Every single shot in this film is a picture stolen from the hidden safes of the worlds greatest artists, or perhaps the worlds greatest artist has simply opened his safe and shown the whole world his vision.  Baz Luhrmann takes on classic pieces of music like, Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend to Your Song by Elton John, to modern classics like Nirvanas ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" to Sting's ""Roxanne"".  Moulin Rogue is an escape from the ordinary and makes us remember why we go the theater.  This film, hopefully, will be accepted by all facets of the industry, and with any luck films which intertwine old and new styles as this one has, will be made more often.  In my mind Moulin Rouge is an instant classic which takes bold risks and pushes the envelope of what we consider good and what we consider outlandish together in one film that is far beyond good and a film which will hopefully affect the future of film making.  In short, I loved this film and I intend to see many more times.  If you see one picture this year or any year, Moulin Rouge should be it."	5.0	Moulin Rogue Sets The Screen Ablaze	2001-06-01	4	4	0

I rented it, watched it, and was amazed.  The movie itself is beautiful... the acadamy awards that it won for costume design was worth it.  The art of the movie is also interesting... the sets of the nightclub and surrounding area is eyecatching.  Plus, Satine's room is inside an elephant!!!The music for this particular musical is something completely different from other musicals.  Instead of original songs (although, I guess you could call the way they use each and every song original), they use a myriad of other songs.  THe soundtrack includes ""Your Song"" by Elton John, ""All You Need is Love"" by The Beatles, ""I Will Always Love You"" by Dolly Parton, ""Like a Virgin"" by Madonna, the theme from ""The Sound of Music,"" the French can-can, and, to my amusement, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Nirvana, and countless others.  Each of these songs is used in a way completely different than what is expected... and even though this movie is set in 1899-1900, the music works.  It goes from strange to reassuring to hear songs that you are already familiar with being sung by all the characters.Finally, the actors are wonderful.  I never knew that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor could sing!If you haven't seen this movie, definately check it out, and try to stay with the movie until the tragic end.

Kidman and Macgregor use their talent to it's full ability. The use of prewritten songs mixing with new songs is innovative and new. It creates a world where the audience knows it's not real.

Baz Luhrman's writing of this film interested me greatly and I hope other people as well. On the Opera a few days after the premiere of the film Baz said he was looking for something with singing, dancing, truth, beauty, freedom, and love and from my point of view I waould say he captured all of the above.	5.0	Moulin Rouge Glory	2001-06-20	4	2	2

Movies are an art. In that context nothing you will ever see on the screen is real.  Personally, I'll take suspended disbelief over reality any day.  Want reality?  Look out your window.  Want a boffo night out with your best girl - indulge in a little vintage Baz Luhrman!Two words best describe ""Moulin Rouge"" - spectacular, spectacular!  This MTV revisionist driven ode to the 50's super musical is a stunning and ecclectic blend of songs and dances.  Nicole Kidman fronts as Satine, the performance artist/courtesan at Paris' most decadent nightclub.  She's pushed into a romance with a duke by her employer, Harold Zeitler (Jim Broadbent) but falls for a penniless artist (Ewan McGregor) instead.  Typical musical fare, but carried off with such flair and good humor that it's captivating to watch.  Even if you don't like musicals you will be hard pressed not to find your toes tapping during ""Spectacular! Spectacular!"" or letting out a hearty chuckle with Broadbent's take on Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"".For conception to final cut this film has been in the mind of director, Baz Luhrman for nearly six years and it shows.  He's delivered an explosive masterpiece with all the trappings of an enduring classic.  If we're still not watching, enjoying and debating over this masterpiece fifty years from now I'll be surprised. Sets are lush and marvelous. So are the costumes. Everything comes off without a hitch.Fox Video has done a handsome job of remastering this film on DVD.  There is nothing to complain about here.  Rich colors, exceptional detail - even in the darkest scenes, bold contrast levels and the absence of any digital anomolies, make ""Moulin Rouge"" a real feast for the eyes.  The 5.1 stereo mix is bombastic and clever, overwhelming the first time listener with its exemplory sound fields.  Disc 2 has an HBO: First Look Special, some featurettes, outtakes and a host of other juicy tidbits best left unexplored within the context of this review.

I scored it &quot;one star&quot; because they wouldn't let me give it zero...or negative stars.The music was LOUD--a hodgepodge of new and old songs. The most memorable song from the movie is a disco song from thirty years ago (there's a reason why disco is dead)that sounded way better by the original artist; derivative Nirvana (if Kurt Cobain hadn't already killed himself...)and a headache inducing &quot;'cause we can cancan&quot; that is an obnoxious beer commercial jingle now.

I have to admit, it is hard to look for a really good musical nowadays, or at least up average would be fine for me. Then, I heard Nicole Kidman is going to star on this musical, so I firgured, what the heck, let's gie it a shot. Since she just had her divorce and such. I must say, I have had put my foot in my mouth for this. The movie was splendid. Despite her personal mishaps, Nicole has proven to be one of the best. She sings, with Ewan Mcgregor as her co-star and they have their work ut out for them.This is a story of a poor writer (Ewan) in strive of getting his unobtainable object of desire (Nicole), who happens to be the main star of this circus theater show in Paris. They succumb into some sort of Forbiddened Love and they tried anything to be and stay together but fate have other plans for them. Nicole has to help her friend and boss from going bankcrupt and with that, she has to attend to this other rich guy, who owns the deed to the place. Help in the sense of be her compainion. Meanwhile, to cover up their affair, the Ewan has manage to create a play, due to mistaken liason earlier in the movie; therefore giving them the room to be together at least somewhere along the line.I must add one thing.The rich man gets what he wants, and if he can't have what he wants...nobody else will either.An applause for this one.	5.0	Come what may...indeed...	2004-07-15	1	1	0

So I thought the blu-ray version would be stunning.  It is-but not in a good way.  The movie is already bright and garish by it's nature.  The blu-ray makes the colors too loud, too garish. It's obnoxious.  The final number where Satine dies is awful, the colors are just wrong.  I won't watch it again.  Major bummer.	2.0	Not everything is better in blu-ray	2011-08-04	6	3	3
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A341BG8RMH8QW	NotATameLion	I never expected to like Moulin Rouge. I despise musicals. Yet, of all the movies I have seen this year, I believe Moulin Rouge is my favorite (I liked the Fellowship of the Ring, but had quibbles--plus Moulin Rouge is an original piece of art).The more I see of Ewan McGregor, the more impressed I am. He could have gone far too over the top with the role of Christian, but he is spot on. One gets drawn into his story and dragged away with him. He deserves the at least as much praise as Kidman is receiving.Kidman is indeed worthy of the praise. This is a killer, yet delicate role that would have disintegrated in lesser hands. The mixture of knowing innocence she brings to the role of Satine is sheer genius. She also shows a great ability at comedy.The supporting cast is delightful. John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, and Jacek Koman are all unforgettable. Kylie Minogue gets the festivities going delightfully as the green fairy. Richard Boxburgh is a wonderfully incompetent villain.I'll admit I still do not like all the music in Moulin Rouge. What won me over when I first saw it, and continues to win me over today is that Moulin Rouge is a great love story. It is a great meditation on the meaning of love.Baz Luhrmann has created a great story and wrapped it in a stunning cinematic vision (a revolution indeed). I have seldom been so impressed with a movie as I am with Moulin Rouge. This DVD version is packaged with all kinds of cool features and extras. I recommend it highly.	5.0	truth, beauty, freedom, and LOVE	2002-03-20	17	15	2

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1XIL6NWEBNV4G	"O. Kang ""bookworm"""	The minute I sat down, i was pulled in. Moulin Rouge has been on of the most magical, entertaining, and captivating movies I have ever seen. Ewan McGregor has an absolutely FANTASTIC voice... the voice than made up my descision to marry a guy with a good voice and have him sing to me all the time (and Ewan isn't exactly hard on the eyes either...)His performance is wonderful and earnest, emotions clearly showing on his face. Nicole Kidman is also wonderful, capturing the image of an icy/emotional seductress whose voice was surprisingly not bad. The imagery was amazing, keeping me on the edge of my seat, each place so distinct that it shall remain in my memory a long time. All the vivid places, colors and how the movie was layed out was absolutely brilliant. The songs were mixed perfectly, the soundtrack never comes out of my cd player (though i wish they had added more songs from the movie). Le Tango de Roxanne was GREAT...i tried not to blink but it didn't work. The ending left in tears and i couldn't even bring myself to get up until all the credits were over. An absolutely fantastic movie; this one will be in my dvd collection.	5.0	The best movie in years	2001-12-14	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AGLS0ZCAWBWKT	Oliver	As it has been stated before, this movie is not for everyone.  For example, how do you describe this great movie to a friend?  &quot;It's a musical about can-can dancing prostitutes!&quot;  One major problem that normal people have with this film is that the editing appears to incluce ten or twelve different camera angles for every spoken sylable.  However, this must've appealed to my attention defficeit, because I wasn't able to tear myself away from the thing.  Between the good voices in the singing scenes are several good acid trips of screaming emotion that counter act the over-the-top horror of emotions we're hit with in, for example, Requiem for a Dream.  But that's another story.  Not since Yellow Submarine have I ever wanted this much to take mind-altering chemicals for the purpose of a movie.  And I'm a conservative Christian who would never actually do such a thing.  It's just THAT GOOD.  So if you or someone you know is really excited about being ADHD or you want to know what it's like, watch it.	5.0	Future Cult Flick	2001-12-15	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2WZ1B92F81LJJ	"Olly Buxton ""@electricray"""	Moulin Rouge continues Baz Luhrman's series of essays in form over substance - the underlying story is as goofy and hamfisted as the character Ewan McGregor is obliged to play, but on top of this flimsy foundation, Luhrman has constructed an incredible superstructure, equal parts high melodrama, burning surreality, bursting colour, dazzling repartee, flash choreography and self-conscious smartypantism.The only comparison in terms of such a rich feast being served on such an insubstantial table is Richard O'Brien's all time classic The Rocky Horror Picture Show. They're very different films but at a fundamental level they're of the same stripe.In terms of tragedy, Moulin Rouge is almost Shakespearian, and would have got there had Nicole sung the whole of Freddy Mercury's harrowing &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; rather than just the critical couplet - it was an odd decision to give this song to Jim Broadbent, driven I suspect by the desire to render the song as differently from Queen's original as possible.In the comedy stakes Toulouse Lautrec is reduced to the leader of a band slapsticks straight out of the Marx Brothers and the villain of the piece is as dastardly as Alan Rickman's Sherriff of Nottingham from Robin Hood Prince of Theives.The plot, as mentioned, is deliberately as hokum as could be. Ands musically, recasting 80s pop trash as fin du siecle vaudeville romp is an inspired idea which pays off in spades.The only disappointment for me was Ewan Mcgregor's voice. I'm surprised at the comments of other viewers here raving about it; after a while Mcgregor's toneless foghorn really grated on me, especially compared against Kidman's much more sophisticated voice, which I was surprised to discover hadn't been dubbed by a professional. (I had picked it as Elaine Paige, a veteran of West End Musicals)Nevertheless a small pick about a unique, highly accomplished film, destined for cult classicdom.

It has beautiful and very talented stars, s captivating love story and wonderful and expressive music. I have been a fan of the director since Strictly Ballroom and he has created a luscious and blindlingly delicious world of vivid and seductive color were love is all that matters and worth any price.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AOYDZNBQ0H5JP	"""orcaman"""	Like A Knight's Tale before it, Moulin Rouge uses anachronistic music to tell its story.  Unlike A Knight's Tale, however, Moulin Rouge actually makes it work from time to time, but it's not enough to save the movie.Set at the famous nightclub in 1899 Paris, Moulin Rouge tells the story of the love between Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young, idealistic writer, and Satine (Nicole Kidman), a dancer who is also the most sought after courtesan at the Moulin Rouge.  Also on hand are artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo), Zidler (Jim Broadbent), owner of the Moulin Rouge; and the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), who is besotted with Satine.Director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann has created a pretty but uneven movie.  The costumes and sets were eye-popping; I only wish he'd decided not to use a Roto-Tiller to edit the movie. Was there a reason why Luhrmann couldn't focus on a dancer for more than one or two seconds?  The first half-hour was particularly tough to sit through, all sound and fury.  The pacing is problematic, too:  after rushing at breakneck speed through the first two acts, the movie lurches from plot point to plot point in the film's final third.  The ending felt both rushed and static:  the final scenes involving Christian and Satine were slow to the point of being inert, but everything else was hectic and jittery.  It felt as if they'd run out of time and couldn't decide how to end it.There was a remarkable lack of chemistry between Kidman and McGregor, or for that matter, anyone else.  For all of the gape-mouthed guffawing and rivers of tears the movie shows, it just felt icy to me.  I just flat didn't care because the movie's central relationship left me so unmoved.  McGregor seemed earnest enough in his role, while Kidman's doomed, consumptive Satine was beautiful but just too remote for me to warm up to her.  (She also suffers from &quot;Ali MaGraw in Love Story&quot; disease -- the sicker she gets, the more beautiful she gets.)  But boy, she sings and dances as well as any healthy person.Oh, and if anyone can tell me what purpose Toulouse-Lautrec served in this movie -- aside from rattling on about &quot;the Bohemian ideal&quot;-- I'd sure like to hear it.  Plus, it would have been nice to see more than two minutes of &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot;--they spent almost the entire movie building it up, yet we're shown virtually none of it.Luhrmann also repeats some shots ad nauseam:  the pull-way-back, pan-left, zoom-way-in sequence, for example.  I lost count of the number of times Luhrmann pulled that trick or its variations.  And what was with the annoying sound effects scattered throughout the movie?  If I see a dancer executing several quick jet&eacute;s, I know he's performing a series of leaps; I don't need to hear &quot;doink-doink-doink&quot; on top of it.  It just took me right out of the moment.Luhrmann's musical choices are hit-or-miss, as well: some are genuinely cringe-inducing (&quot;Your Song&quot; and especially &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; -- ugh!),  while two are beautiful to the point of transcendence (&quot;Roxanne&quot;, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;).  The stars' singing voices are pretty but bland, especially McGregor's and Kidman's.  I ho-hummed through their duets.  Jacek Koman's Unconscious Argentinian, however, possesses a wonderfully rough, passionate voice that brought the pain and misery of &quot;Roxanne&quot; to wonderful, delirious fruition.So, to sum up this too-long review:  Moulin Rouge could have been so much more than it was, but Baz Luhrmann just couldn't pull it off.  And that's a shame.  My grade:  C-terry-	3.0	Flashy but ultimately empty	2001-07-14	5	1	4

It is not just a movie...it is a cinematic experience the likes of which I have never before seen.The music is rapturous, and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's voices compliment each other and the story perfectly. At times the scenery was as surreal as something you would experience in a dream, which only makes this movie more amazing. 'Moulin Rouge' shows love from all angles. It includes the raw passion, infatuation, vehemence, intensity, ecstasy, jealousy, and pain that are found in true love. The acting was staggering. Ewan McGregor is unrealistically perfect, combining sweet innocence with masculinity. Kidman perfectly brings out the seductive side of Satine, yet never loses the vulnerable soul that lies behind it. Besides, Nicole Kidman has a willowy and perfect figure to manage those elegant clothes in the movie. Roxburgh(The Duke) and Leguizamo(Lautrec) bring out just the right amount of comic relief in this intense drama.The brilliant score skillfully weaves many modern, popular songs, and rescores them as the libretto to this grand opera. The outstanding visual was also a strong point of this movie. The costumes and the set decoration in this movie are spectacularly ravishing.`Moulin Rouge' is an explosion of sights and sounds, a film laced with humor and visual largess that holds a poignant and dramatic story at it's heart. Entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable, this is a memorable film and a satisfying movie-going experience.

I am not a fan of Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet"", and musicals aren't my thing.  That being said, this film was an utterly intoxicating piece of filmmaking that had few equals in 2001.Director Luhrmann decided to reconstruct the classic Hollywood Musical in his own unique way, and succeeded briliiantly.  The script is funny and heartfelt, and the characters unique.  The two leads, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, give two of the best performances of their careers, especially Kidman, who shines as star/courtesan Satine.  McGregor also stretches his acting muscles, more so than in any film since ""Trainspotting"".  Their performances achor the film, but the supporting cast is briliant as well.  John Leguizamo goes aganist type and is exceedingly funny as Toulouse.  Jim Broadbent epitimizes the master showman as nightclub owner Harry Zidler.  And Richard Roxburgh, who I'd only seen in the awful ""MI:2"", oozes evil as the Duke, who wants to have Satine all too himself.The camera is constantly on the move in this film, but that is actually in it's favor.  The opening half hour is so amazing that you have to watch the DVD to see how they pulled it off to really appreciate it.  It's truly inspired.  As for the music, the highlights include a hilarious version of ""Like a Version"", a pull-out-the-stops rendition of ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"", and a great love medly.  All of these are filmed tounge in cheek, a challange to future filmmakers to top the extravagance without losing the substance.  All in all, this film is a must own for a DVD enthusiast, as the Two-Disc set shows how the film got made, and includes great featurettes and a good commentary from Director Luhrmann and his cinematographer.

My fiancee and I bought the DVD based on positive reviews.  We sat down to watch it expecting some harmless, escapist fun.  Instead we were stunned by the beauty and sincerity of the story and the performances, which left us in tears.  As a former actor who has performed in musicals in the past, I know how difficult it is to communicate real moments and emotions rather than broad portrayals.  The cast did this wonderfully, lead by the brilliant performances of Nicole and Ewan.  Their abiltiy to convey emotional intensity through a simple look, facial expression or movement was awe inspiring.In addition, Baz is a visual genious of a director and the DVD is loaded with enough entertaining and enlightening extras to keep you busy for weeks.  In short, BUY THIS DVD!	5.0	Immediately joined my all time top 10 list	2002-02-07	9	7	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1B2MF00TB0ECG	Pauline	I gave it 5 stars because it is very unique and different. Nof this era, in terms of hollywood doesn't do musicals anymore. I do recommend it for that reason and I think people will, moreorless, enjoy it.It's a sad tale, but not so much a tear jerker (close though). Very hip and upbeat. Sad in a sense as well, simply because Kidman's character was torn between the one that she loves and her career. As well as, she's struck by an illness, inwhich she doesn't know about for quite awhile.I recommend it. And I will surely buy it on DVD or VHS.	5.0	all I can say is that it's different...	2001-07-28	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1ZQTOILE2R1S6	Paul LoveKing	It looks great, it sounds great, it does nothing for me at all. It goes nowhere, and it couldn't interest me in the characters at all. Cardboard cutouts have more personality. The storyline simply wasn't there. My ruler has more twists. Had I seen it in the theatre, I would have walked out and gone and seen whatever was playing in the next room. If you love musicals and are amused by rhe constant recyling of old pop music lyrics in a new context, by all means, you'll love this one, but before you buy it, rent it. It's very easy not to like. We hit stop with over an hour remaining, and I don't expect we'll put it back in the DVD player.	1.0	Another vote for crap	2002-07-03	12	5	7

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2ENNVJOBVSWG6	P. Broyles	I could go on for pages about just how wonderful the 2001 sensation Moulin Rouge is.  But I won't bother.  As I'm sure you've gleaned from all the other reviewers right now, it's a film that many people love passionately and many others hate just as passionately.  For that reason, you should probably head down to your local rental store before you buy this one.Whether you like it or not, you can't fail to be impressed with how amazingly put together it is.  The look of the film is very distinctive -- it's hardly surprising that it won an Art Design Oscar.  Likewise, the set design and costuming (an Oscar win in Costuming, too) are top-notch, recreating the whimsical, sexy merger of pop culture with 1890s France that creator Baz Luhrman is for.  It's worth looking at even if you don't think you'll like it.But if you do like it, then this DVD is a must-have.  Don't settle for the one-disc edition; I don't care about the cost.  Save up a little longer.  It's worth it.  This is quite possibly the best DVD set ever produced, utilizing the format to its fullest.  Disc 1 features two commentary tracks, both extremely interesting, but the real beauty of the set is in disc 2.  It's there that you'll find the script excerpts, sketches, and discussions that show the film's fascinating evolution.  It's there that you see the music videos that seem obligatory for a film accompanied almost entirely by pop music.  But that's not the real magic of this presentation.  What really makes it special is the uncut dance numbers.  Uncut, multi-angle dance numbers.  Not only do you get to see those energetic, magical sequences from the film come to life -- but you can choose how to see it. ...  It's great.To summarize:  If you're the cautious type, you'll probably want to see it before you buy it.  But if you can find it in your heart to like it at all, then you'll adore this DVD.	5.0	A perfect DVD for an excellent	2003-11-22	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A11WKQYGX53ZS9	"Pedro B. Celis ""Global Citizen"""	I think that the marketing done to this film was wrong.  It did not convey what the film actually is.  At first I was not interested in seeing the film, but somehow, one day I went to see it because some people had told me they had liked it.I fell in love with the film.  I believe that it is an extraordinary piece of film making in every regard:  music; actors; director; editing; photography; make-up; dresses ...I could not make my wife see it in theaters as she did not like the idea of seeing such a movie.  I, of course, bought the DVD and showed it to her.  She did not like it !!!  I could not believ it because I thought that she would actually like it.  In her opinion, the music is good but the imaginery, the takes, the photography is too harsh, quick, overwhelming.  Actually that is true, but that was one of the things I liked about it.It is certainly not a Marylin Monroe style of musical.  It actually has a beatifull love story in it.  The acting is superb.  Just to think that these actors are actually singing by themselves such beatiful potpourry fo music is amazing, but at the same time they act incredibly well and they are able to convey their caracters and emotions wonderfully.I use to think that Musicals were done for people that had no idea about acting.  Well, this one is not like that.  And would give the Oscar to Nicole Kidman; to Baz Luhrmann; and the film itself.I highly recomend this film.  I have still to see Brilliant Minds, but up to now this is the film of 2001.	5.0	Best Film of the Year !!!	2002-02-20	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AF4I6VHF7YMOL	"Peggy F. Finch ""Goblintrain"""	"Every time one sees a disagreeable film, it is easy to say ""this was the worst movie i've ever watched!"" Almost any movie that viewers write opinions on is bound to have this statement attached to it somewhere. However, Moulin Rouge is exceptional in this respect for me because it has held that distinction for five years now. Why? It is an insult to the musical genre with its snipping & clipping modern pop song & dance into a ninteenth century setting. It falls flat on its face in terms of comedy and drama, because of script that tries to pass cliche predictability, and lack of inspiration as classic. Instead, it becomes as a groping, inexperienced attempt at making a musical that is at the same time, too ignorant with arrogance to even include the most thread-bare basics of a good musical. An original, period consistent musical score is one essential the director some how felt the movie didn't need.  No, i'm not kidding! Using the camera to flatter the sets, costumes, & performances of the actors is another tool that was thrown away. It is literally impossible to appreciate the sets, costumes, and dances in this movie because of meth-amphetamine style camera work that grows literally nauseating even after just a few minutes of exposure.  But then, perhaps the frenzy with the cameras is understandable because he didn't respect his performers either!  They were totally out of thier league in attempting song & dance!The overall result is that this movie defecates on the shoes of the viewers attempting to appreciate it, as well as the actors performing in it! Egomaniacal directing, bad casting, and scissor-happy editing destroy this movie that aspired to such beauty! I wonder how Nicole Kidman felt about being made to bounce around barking like some over-sexed French poodle?  Was that just one more snotty insult from the director? Ever since witnessing that awful spectacle i have not been able to look at her without reliving the sick memory of it!I am a fan of the old style musicals and even sexy new one's like 'Chicago'.  If those are what you like too, i think you will be very disappointed with Moulin Rouge and i would not recommend it for you. However, my opinion is in the minority here. So, to be fair to the reader, if you haven't seen Moulin Rouge yet, just rent it or watch it with friends first before you consider buying it. Sincerely. Know yourself first -don't purchase this out of peer pressure or hype! This is a movie that has few indifferent viewers.  Either they love it fanatically like many of the reviewers here do, or they absolutely loathe it like myself & the rest of us do.

His arrogance killed his opportunity to be viewed as a visionary, and this film, especially, should be dismissed as a stock production best left to very lewd community theatres in lesser California communities.The only redeeming quality the film offers: Ewan McGregor can sing, and he sings with a passion.  Had the film centered on his character instead of the stock players, MOULIN ROUGE might've worked.  Since Baz couldn't contain his arrogance, he's done little more than provided 'the alternative lifestyle community' with a regular rental and a film that the rest of society will rightfully ignore.	1.0	Undoubtedly, The Worst Movie Ever Made	2003-03-15	19	10	9

I regret not having seen such a classic on the wide screen at the cinema. However by chance,i saw it on the plane during a biz trip..i watched it over and over through out the whole course of the flight...i could not help myself from crying when Satine was at her last breath. And suddenly I came to realise, &quot;love&quot; when its 'true', is frankly something quite very 'simple'. Many on the otherhand, I guess think otherwise --assuming it to be that of a 'complex' nature. The reason i say what I say is simply due to the the critism of which the movie had received -- being a very &quot;obvious&quot; and &quot;sappy&quot; love story. But hey, isn't love &quot;obvious&quot; and &quot;sappy&quot;...and thus what is wrong with it being so? Remember that these are the things that make us &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;hopeful&quot;. And I must admit that it was quite refreshing to actually see one of those &quot;classic&quot; love stories come to life on the screen again - and that of which was so magically done! The actor/actresses were breathtaking...the music was so moving, so creative and so well sung...as a lover of the arts...i was blown away. I especially would like to give my highest regards to &quot;Nicole&quot;...&quot;you are an amazing actress&quot;and of course, &quot; Baz&quot;, I would love to be inside your head.....you are one dedicated genious&quot;.

I was tottaly charmed by the songs, the talent the actors had, and the atmosphere of the film. It began with happiness, fun and laugh, but then, the part of the tragedy came... When you first see the begging, you think ""It will be more fun than I thought"". But when the tragedy comes, then you don't have to think anything cauze everything is on the screen. It is one of the greatest musicals ever, in my opinion. It will teach you lot's of things and some of them will stay in your heart for ever...If you really want to know the true meaning of the film, then you must not lose a sentence from it. Every word has a different meaning.I think even you don't like most of musicals, you might like this one. I don't like so much musicals and when I saw MR, I got obsessed with everything in it. It has something different for all the other films, something you will manage to find yourself. It is a sad romantic film and it can describe love.Another thing that touched me was the music.

If Fox wants to survive, one of the first things it has to do is fire the sript-writer but maybe there was not any or maybe, to save money, Baz Luhrmann did ask some young illiterate 12 years old boy to write something about Paris, Love and Moulin Rouge. Whatever, the result is a complete disaster. Everything sounds wrong and you cannot understand why Nicole Kidman would fall in love with such a dumb guy who has no idea about writing or singing, and certainly no gift for poetry.

I found the whole experience highly enjoyable (watching both the documentary &amp; the movie itself) &amp; got to learn more about Baz, the whimsical Director who was able to connect with his audience by introducing contemporary pop culture into a story that was set back a century ago.  Baz shared one similar sentiment with Peter Jackson, the New Zealand director who brought us Lord of the Rings, that the essence of going to watch their movies was to allow viewers to escape from the real world just momentarily &amp; thus, the movies were never meant to be taken seriously but as feast to the eyes.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	Baz Luhrmann brings back the musical to the movie scene with Moulin Rogue.  Mr. Luhrmann succeeds with the visual aspect of the movie.  The imagery is striking with stunning sets and beautiful cinematography.  Nicole Kidman is absolute breath taking as the doomed Satine.  She shines every moment she graces the screen.  The problem with Moulin Rogue is that the storyline is weak and there are basically no original songs.  The movie is based in 1899, but the songs are mostly from the rock era.  In one scene a young writer played by Ewen MacGregor sings Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot; to Ms. Kidman and in another the Moulin Rogue's owner Jim Broadbent sings &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; to a Duke (Played snarkly by Richard Roxborough) who is in love Satine and wants her in return for financing a play.  It is a weird juxtaposition of time periods that works to a degree because the songs have a built in popularity, but it lacks the creativity of the original scores for musicals of old.  Overall, Moulin Rogue is worth watching for the look and Ms. Kidman.	3.0	Visually Stunning, Lacking Content	2002-02-14	2	1	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2CT2KU6H3CW2V	pnotley@hotmail.com	"It is odd that ""Moulin Rouge"" should win eight academy award nominations.  Not only is it not as good as ""The Others"" or ""A.I."" but, more important from the academy's perspective, it did not make as much money as either of them.  It no doubt was helped by the fact that, while not an innovative and pathbreaking new movie, it strongly resembled Hollywood's idea of one.  Where other movies offer the euphoria of something truly original, ""Moulin Rouge"" provides frenzy and sensation for its own sake.  Whereas other movies offer a new perspective, ""Moulin Rouge"" indulges weird anachronism.  Why should the average moviegoer be expected to know think about Fin de siecle Paris, in the midst of the Dreyfus Affair, or as anarchism and marxism clashed for the soul of French socialism, or as a certain Catholic nationalism poised to mutate into something too close to fascism?  Why should the average moviegoer be reminded that this was the time of Proust and Gaugin and Debussy, of the first cinema industry and the Curies?  Best provide people with what they think they know, even if Toulouse-Lautrec is reduced to saying cliches about ""love, truth, beauty and freedom.""Musicals are nothing without music.  What Luhrmann has done is create the first musical where the main focus is on the editing.  Not editing for any particular purpose, not to show any emotion or even enthusiasm but as an exercise in his own virtuosity.  The results are scattershot.  There is an amusing cameo by Kylie Minogue as the Tinkerbell Absinthe Fairy.  The scene where the characters hoodwink the duke into supporting their ridiculous Spectacular is amusing.  Jim Broadbent does an amusing version of ""Like a Virgin,"" that matches Quientin Tarantino's riff on it in ""Reservoir Dogs.""  Broadbent is helped by the fact that most people do not have strong feelings for the song.  And if you ever wanted people to sing ""Lady Marmalade"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" in turn of the century France, well, here's your chance.It's not enough.  There is the worst version of ""Roxanne"" I've ever heard, done as a particularly bombastic tango.  John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec is excruciating, though that might be the script's fault.  But the main problem is the love story at the focus of the movie.  The story is a cliche, so Luhrmann seeks to drown it in heavy irony.  The sentimental can still believe in the story, people who know the price of everything and the value of nothing can pride themselves on their hip irony, and those in between can be manipulated accordingly.  It doesn't work.  How can we believe that the main characters are in love when Luhrmann doesn't, and doesn't want us to?  Nicole Kidman actually does a good job given the hopeless position she is put in, but Ewan McGregor is singularly unconvincing.  In my opinion I don't think ""Your Song"" is so irretrievably bad that it can never be affecting if sung with conviction.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2CMYX10636NG2	Portia	First of all, let me make one thing very very clear.I got this movie. I totally get it. I love theater, am a very big theater person, and have no qualms about sitting through hours of singing and dancing in a &quot;stagey&quot; style.However, I have several large gripes with this film.I thought I was going to LOVE it after the very first Sound of Music &quot;parody&quot; sequence. I was like: &quot;I get it! This is fun!&quot; But then, I was suddenly watching Madonna music videos. I was never quite sure what I was watching. Of course, this was probably deliberate because I also got (and enjoyed, frankly) the fairy-tale illustrated 2D backdrops to the whole film, and the gorgeous, over-the-top costuming. Madonna, however, I could've easily done without.I didn't really feel bad that Nicole Kidman died at the end. It was so incredibly expected, that I didn't care about her enough to feel any emotion. Which leads me to my second gripe: flat characterization.Mostly, I hated that I wanted to see an artsy, stagey show and I was watching 80's music videos. That's the biggest thing.Ok: what did I love? I LOVED the &quot;Roxanne&quot; sequence. LOVED IT. LOVED IT. I loved most of the fairy-tale quality of the filming and staging. I did not, however, like Nicole Kidman trying to do &quot;Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend&quot;.All in all? See it. It is an experience. But don't expect the best movie ever, I did and was disappointed.	3.0	my love/hate relationship with Moulin Rouge...	2003-07-16	4	4	0

For those reluctant because it's a musical, I found it to be never full of itself or ""insisting on itself"" (which is the reason I can't stand musicals), but rather I found Moulin Rouge to be a lighthearted tongue in cheek jab at the stereotype, telling a tragic tale in a comic light that actually, made the story much more credible.  It's much like a live action cartoon, especially with the sound design, and the acting, considering what's described on paper, is outstanding considering everyone's playing a cartoon role in a sense, but it's completely sincere throughout.  Oddly not many people think of this as a comedy, but that's what I got out of it...a cartoonish jab at a dramatic story, that despite being satirical towards the genre, manages to still tell a credible story.  It's not the most unique story, but how it's told is.I'd say definitely see it, even if you're doubtful.  It will either become your favorite movie or most despised (from talking with other people, there seems to be no middle ground).

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2BXYC5Z2TMZY5	p-teK	Before I begin this review- let me say that those of you who hated this movie don't appreciate it for what it is.  It is incomparable to anything else- that is what makes it great.  Look closer at the film.  See its unique blend of slapstick, macabre, romance, lust, and music.  If you still hate it, Ok.As I walked into the theatre I was prepared for something very odd- in the style of Romeo and Juliet (by the same director- horrible movie) but darker and hopefully- better.  What a treat.  Luhrmann shows his Burtonesque side wonderfully with quick camera moves and a moving score with the night being used to convey life.  The plot is somewhat old- a man and a woman who can't love each other do.  But this plot mocks itself in the play that the two write about their own lifes.Kidman's character is an untouchable beauty ruined by her profession- prostitution.McGregor's character is a struggling writer who meets very strange folk that lead him to his love.This film recieved both acclaim and criticism for its use of modern-day music in a early 20th century time- but this keeps the audience from sinking into a boring historical fiction romance story point of view.  It keeps the characters and story alive and adds tongue-in-cheek humor to the mix.In conclusion, this trip down the rabbit hole is a dark, tragic, yet joyful tale of freedom, truth, beauty, and above all things, love.	5.0	Completely and Utterly Original	2001-07-26	3	3	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3QXG7YFNNVJPU	"Purer Scorns ""rayna106"""	"It is undoubtedly one of this year's most polarizing movies - Moulin Rouge, directed by Baz Luhrmann and starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. Some film critics have put a lot of effort in trying to write as negative movie reviews as possible - the movie has been declared as all too banal. But it might also be stated that this film is a cleverly done persiflage, the work of a genius, a master of creating colorful and powerful images.Firstly, critics have argued that the story behind the movie is full of clich&eacute;s and simply dull. They might not have considered the fact that Luhrmann uses these clich&eacute;s, such as the often cited ""boy meets girl meets doom"", fully consciously. 'Moulin Rouge' can be regarded as a very entertaining parody of the musical genre. Luhrmann constantly gives reference to what is generally known as typical musical elements, such as the overly emotional dramaturgy accumulating to a tearful climax. The attribute ""banality"" is by no means justified. As a very neat feature, the director constructs an extremely entertaining parallelism between the movie's story proper and the content of the play that the characters in the movie rehearse.It might have been unclear to most critics that this movie definitely is a musical. So complaints about flat, unsophisticated dialogues rather seem of no use. Witty conversation or a complicated storyline is certainly not what musicals aim at. However, what does play an important role in a movie like `Moulin Rouge', is the music. It has been widely criticized that the clash between the historical scenario and the music consisting of commonly known pop songs was too enormous. In fact, using well known songs for new musical projects is a frequently used method which was especially popular during the forties and fifties. This method is a very clever tool in order to lose the historical distance between the audience and the scenario. By taking up familiar music for the soundtrack, the director creates a direct link between his audience and the  story.Another reproach is that the song parts of the medleys are too chopped; by sticking together only small splinters of love song classics like ""I Will Always Love You"", ""Up Where We Belong"" or ""Your Song"", the spirit of the various songs are lost. Therefore, according to critics, pieces like the love song medley cannot touch the heart of the audience. However, this collage of love songs is much more likely to touch the audience because it causes interaction. On watching the movie, the audience is constantly trying to figure out which song is being referred to, and consciously thinking about the lyrics, so that the overall message ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return"" can be perfectly well received.Luhrmann has also been accused of not being able to handle the speed of the movie: according to film reviewers the atmosphere created by the astonishing kick off with fast, almost MTV-like editing then all of a sudden collapses into a too old stereotypical love story. Looking at this from another angle, the powerful opening scene should rather be interpreted as an overture  - a direct access for the audience to get at once into the Moulin Rouge feeling.The big plus of the movie is the entertainment factor - and that is what a musical is all about. The comedic presentation of the characters, the impresario Harold Zidler and the Can-Can dancers and the wonderful music contributes to a movie that is probably not full of surprises but comes up with breathtaking visual arrangements, wonderful music and beautiful pictures. It is definitely worth watching."	5.0	Why watch moulin rouge?	2002-01-24	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A18EMOMMDZBNI3	"""quirkypixie24"""	This is definitely THE BEST movie ever made, hence the five stars.  This is Baz Luhrmann's third and final installment of the Red Curtain series he directed, which also includes &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; and &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet&quot;.  There are a couple comparisons I've noticed that I'll point out right now: The &quot;L'amour&quot; sign on the side on Christian's apartment building is painted on a wall near the pool hall (that happens to be called the Globe Theatre, which is where Billy Shakespeare had his plays performed in England) in &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet&quot;.  Also, the leading lady in &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;, Tara Morice, appears in a short cameo at the beginning of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; as a prostitute with cigarette smoke curling out of her mouth who glares at the camera for a split-second before the camera cuts to the Bar Absinthe.I love music, and it was awesome that it was filled to the brim with covers of pop classics from the '80s and '90s, such as Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and Madonna's &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; among many others.Nicole Kidman was beyond perfect as Satine, the doomed courtesan, and Ewan McGregor did a smashing performance as Christian, the sensitive writer.I can't say enough good things about this movie.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2XMITJM4313K	"""rachaelreese"""	Hear me out first--I would rather give this movie 2 and 1/2 stars instead of 2, but sadly I didn't think it was worth 3...I started out believing I would love this movie--it would become maybe my favorite movie of all time! When I saw the previews, theads, all of it looked promising...I respect movies like these--they are original and creative and bright. I suppose I spoke too soon.Many, many people walked out of this movie--left disappointed like I wanted to. The minute I saw this movie it let me down.Just the movement of the camera work--the movie of the movie--the way it went--it made you feel like your head was in a blender. (I believe I wrote that somewhere else.) Not only that--a blender with every color of the universe in it to make you even more confused and at times disgusted and thinking to yourself you'd rather actually be IN a blender than watching this movie. Ewan's and Nicole's vocal talents can be impressiveat times but not even that can save this &quot;film?&quot;&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was TOO unique. I tend to believe Baz saw this as an opportunity to make a movie out of the ordinary. It came out being two movies. &quot;Unique&quot; doesn't always mean &quot;good&quot;.At first the music never ceases or slows in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. Thereis a constant flow of it--from a swirling display of can-can dancers twirling to Fat Boy Slim to a sudden jerk of Ewan McGregor screaming out &quot;The Sound of Music Lyrics&quot; to another sudden jerk (of it I mean the camera) to Kidman in diamonds onto of a swing--then to the Duke with an excessive half hour of bopping and hopping and jumping here and there (in an overly ornate elephant?) with tunes from Elton John to Madonna to--ERR--just about everything and not once do they calm down--lighten up--or let us catch our breathes. Sometimes I ask myself-and I find myself doing it particually with this movie-doesn't the director every see their terrible flaws?Then we get into it. The &quot;Love Story&quot; that is. Boy meets girl-girl is a singing prositute threathened by an evil duke to be taken away from boy-boy is so madly in love that something with the strength and vigor of &quot;El Tango De Roxanne&quot; plays through the speakers. The end is so predicable and the story proves to be so UN-original. They tried to create a such a deepness and concentration on this silly plot line at times stupid story that it comes out laugable. I think what a waste on film and sets and costumes and actors!&quot;Rouge&quot; could have been infinitely better--they could have kept the same music somewhat (perhaps somemore origial songs to straighten it out) and sets and costumes ect. It is really wonderful when films set in the 19th century or such use modern pop songs with a twist and beat to bring a sense of fantasy to it. It is brillant when the sets and costumes reflect this-when they show that none of this is possibly-when it all appears like it's a dream.Please don't think I am saying that the music is awful-in fact I was dying for the soundtrack afterwards except for pieces like the remake of Madonna's &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; just did not handle the music right. They cramed it all together at one point. Then they never stopped. At times it went to fast. At times it went to slow. They used the music inproperly. It might have been one of the best shows ever if they balanced it out.First they could have had an up-beat music fest in the beginning(with a few moments of peace in between for us relax and grasp what is going on)-then slowed it down, build with mellow tunes to a the end and alas bring in the weight of the songs like&quot;Hindu Sad Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Roxanne&quot;. And why not play the whole song for once instead of skipping around to piece after piece?&quot;Roxanne&quot; is such an overpowering and beautiful piece (whether it be from Sting or not) that it should have been saved--saved for something with more of a story line. The singers sound like  they are overwhelmed with the growth of the Nazi power instead of--what was it again?--love?--the distructing of the night club?--still not big enough. (This is why I think the whole gist of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; would have worked so much preferable with something like &quot;Cabaret&quot;).The reason this movie is like two short films instead of one is it's immedate cut to what seems like an SNL skit to the battlefields of WW2. I would not like to be inside Baz's head when he was thinking of bringing this movie to life. Well, hegot noticed, I'll give him that. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; should not have been called &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. It was barely about the club. This happens with many movies (Pearl Harbor, Titanic) than intertwine a love story that at all does not connect to reflect the main purpose for evening making the film!It may sound like I am gravely disappointed. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; did fall flat on it's own windmill. I gave this movie 2 stars for the fact that I liked the general idea of what thet where trying to create--but they didn't succeed. I really cannot comprehend why people LOVE this movie with 5 stars. Can't they see it's flaws? How can they understand it? Yet some people that gave it 1 stars seem to do this for the simple fact that they have no imagination and think the people that made this movie actually though France was like that at the time.Whether you gave it 5 stars or 1 I really don't think you're apsychoneurotic deranged oaf--if that's what you like so be it.Young or old people seem to either hate or love this film. I'lllook at it as maybe a step to further improving musicals into masterpieces--something &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; failed to be.	2.0	Somewhat a disappointment-Somewhat not...	2002-01-18	2	0	2

Again, Hollywood gave me a film that was just a remake of a very overdone plot. Basically, it failed to pull me into the pathos of the film. I am supposed to feel sorry for this girl who is willing to throw herself into bed for this man to bankroll her show.  Of course there were a few original duets that were stunning--the highlight being the clear tenor voice of the hero.  But the villian was way too overdone.  I didn't believe him at all. Way two dimensional. Its too bad the writers didn't try to work on some original dialogue instead of making everything some allusion.  But if you can live with a lot of silly remakes of songs like Roxanne and some great sets, with a few beautiful moments thrown in, it will work for you. Its parts were basically greater than the whole which is too bad. Nicole is stunning in it, but her acting didn't give the character any more realness than the script did. I hate to say it, but its a musical non-musicians love.	3.0	A few Good Moments	2004-01-04	1	0	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A5ZUZ49YRDPCV	Rachel Garret	"Baz Luhrman is an exceptional avant-garde director and artist. His ""Red Curtain Trilogy"" is composesd of Strictly Ballroom, Romeo and Juliet and concludes with Moulin Rouge. The ""Red Curtain"" refers to the opening curtain rise at the opening of the films. Moulin Rouge is a beautiful film, cinematically lush and romantic to watch. The songs and dancing, the meat of the musical genre, are connected in a sublime fashion, accessible to audiences of all ages, but almost specifically, the MTV and pop generation. Baz Luhrman attempted to revive the musical format on film again, a lost art in Hollywood since the 30's, 40's 50's and 60's. Although a non-musical film in the 60's has been made about the decadent nightclub of 19th century Paris (starring Zsa Zsa Gabor), Luhrman assembled fine actors and singers to tell a tragic story tinged with human emotion, from comedy to heartaching tragedy.Nicole Kidman sizzles as the vibrant, elegant, sexy courtesan Satine, who stirs inspiration and love in the heart of the young writer, Christian (played by Ewan Mcgregor). But there is rivalry for the fair lady's hand. A villainous, pompous and wealthy Duke  also falls for Satine and will stop at nothing to have her. The love triangle becomes complicated when Satine must make love with the Duke in order to save the popular nightclub. But when her love for Christian proves stronger than the domineering Duke's powers, the real tragedy unfolds. Art begins to imitate life as the musical the bohemian actors in Paris put on is a mirror projection of Christian and Satine's love, nearly foiled by a jealous and dark Duke. The songs come from the 80's (Madonna's aterial Girl, Like A Virgin, We Can Be Heroes, Nature Boy, Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong), with the exception of a few selections from the Sound of Music (The Hills Are Alive) and the song popularized by Marilyn Munroe in the late 50's, ""Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend"". Added songs for the musical itself are key moments, such as Satine singing about her hope to rise to stardom and to escape from the dissolute life of a courtesan (One Day I'll Fly Away) and the love duet with Ewan Mcgregor (Come What May) which becomes their signature love theme. Another fine moment is when Satine must convince in false act that she no longer loves Christian and will remain in the Moulin Rouge while the cast prepares for the musical that night (The Show Must Go On). Superb performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor as the star-crossed lovers. The costumes and scenery are highly provocative and true to late 19th century Paris. Shots of Montmatre and the Eiffel Tower, touched by fantasy (such as an opera-singing tenor moon sung by Placido Domingo and a Gothic castle for the Duke). Providing the most comic relief is John Leguizamo's performance as the drunk bohemian artist Toulouse Lautrec. This film on DVD is a fine gift for romantics, a great collection on the shelf not only as a musical, but a great romantic story that has not come in a long while."	5.0	Romantic Tragedy: Perfect Musical Valentine Gift	2003-02-14	7	7	0

If you actually listen to the words you might understand. It is the words of the songs that tell the story. I personally think it was very cleverly done. As for Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, it also fits into the movie. The rich men are singing the line ""here we are now, entertain us"" from the song, as they are entering the Moulin Rouge nightclub. If people would pay attention to the words they might get it! It might not be a completely original story. In fact, it isn't. It's your classic boy meets girl and falls in love. Girl is with another man and has to hide her love, but true love conquers all.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1SVXJZ3386U2D	Randy Keehn	"I finally got to see ""Moulin Rouge!"" the other night and I was rather underwhelmed.  I remember that this movie came out the same year as ""Chicago"" and ""The Piano Player"" both of which were excellent movies.  I generally heard ""Moulin Rouge!"" mentioned as being in the same class.  The buzz at Oscar time was which of the three would win Best Picture.  Frankly, I see no comparison between ""Moulin Rouge!"" and the other two except that the subject of music somehow is involved in all three.What disappointed me the most about ""Moulin Rouge!"" was the use of recent and not so recent hit songs.  From ""Diamonds ar a Girl's Best Friend"" to ""Like a Virgin"" and everything in between, I found myself shocked that a modern-day musical would borrow its' music from the top 40 charts.  There may have been an original song or two; I haven't kept up with the Hit Parade for the last 20 or so years so what I hadn't heard before may or may not have been original.  Either way, it seemed like a cheap way to create a ""musical"".What disappointed me almost as much was the Willie Wonka-like characters.  I gathered that we were dealing somewhat with a mixture of fantasy and reality but the mix wasn't working for me.  I couldn't get into either dimension.About the time I was looking to see just how much longer this elaborate turkey was going to continue there came a scene that grabbed my attention.  It was a scene (about two thirds of the way into the film) in which there was an artistic interpretation of jealosy.  An angry man danced the Tango with a retinue in bitter step and I was witness to one of those rare scenes when artistic expression communicates better than any dialogue could have in its place.  It was brilliant!  After that the rest of the movie became somewhat more interesting and the storyline became somewhat more logical and the impression I had of ""Moulin Rouge!"" became somewhat more favorable.I was impressed with the sets and the costume design.  I understood that there were various levels on which people could enjoy this movie.  However, as a musical, I was disappointed at the lack of originality.

Gone is the sensitivity and intimacy of ""Strictly Ballroom"".  Gone is the creativity and re-imagination of ""Romeo+Juliet"".  Gone are 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.What was everybody thinking on this film?  Ewan MacGregor is so bland you want to salt him.  Nicole Kidman reminded me of those cartoon ostriches in the ballet.  John Leguizamo has never been this annoying, not even in Spawn.Not only that, but the movie is ugly to look at.  The whole thing's a bloody eyesore.  The editing looked like it was done by a spastic with ADD.  The sets looked like they were done with Crayolas and popsicle sticks.  The lighting gave me a headache.And then there's the music.  Ho-ly-crap.  Derivitive would be much too kind.  Actually, to call it musical would still be way too kind.  The soundtrack sounds like it was played by a stump-armed monkey on a broken calliope, sung by men and women who obviously gargled with Drano before going into the studio.If this is what passes for genius in today's modern idiom, I feel sorry for you.  Oh well, one man's fertilizer is another's horse-apple.You'd be better off spending your money on a big box of Post Toasties.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ABU7I2Z9M0Q5I	"rballjones ""rballjones"""	I had high expectations when I went to see this film.  But I was so disappointed I left sometime past the first hour.  For one, I somehow had the impression it was going to be about turn of the (20th) century Paris.  It was not. Instead of a Parisian set, the viewer is given computer animation--as one might see in a video game.  The dialogue and the characters, likewise, have little to do with that era.After the opening, swooping, computer-created visuals of Paris, the viewer sees a typewriter working while the unseen narrator talks. This scene seems to go on forever; however, I should have appreciated it more for most everything that follows is like a high-speed roller coaster.  Viewers eventually see the lead character, Ewan McGregor, as he inexplicably falls through the floor of his apartment into another where several characters (or should I say caricatures) are rehearsing a play.  McGregor offers a cliched line or two to the group and they are impressed by his apparent talent.  Later, McGregor and crew go to a dance show where he sees Nicole Kidman performing.  He falls in love with her at first site.  She passes out during the performance and, well, one can see without too much imagination how the plot might develop.  One other twist: she is apparently already spoken for--by the Duke.Maybe it's because I'm over 40 but the non-stop, jerky, in-your-face camera movements were simply exhausting, not exhilirating.  Indeed, their manic, aggressive pace made me wonder if the  director wasn't under some kind of chemical inducement.Moulin Rouge is a musical.  But there is no original music.  Instead, it is filled with 70s pop songs.  So much for Paris.  McGregor sings &quot;Your Song,&quot; a nice song, to Kidman many, many times.  Otherwise, bits of various songs, e.g., &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; are awkwardly pushed into the dialogue.  It really stuck me as amateurish--something anyone could put together.The romance between McGregor and Kidman is surely a highlight to many.  Of course their features: his blue eyes, her smooth skin, are computer-enhanced to achieve the maximum effect.There are other memorable moments, such as when she is flopping about on the floor trying to fool the Duke, like a child trying to fool a parent. But the Duke, unlike the parent, doesn't seem to have a clue.Viewers should not assume this is a great movie because it is nominated for Oscars.  Evidently it is popular but I for one find little to recommend.	1.0	Beware of the hype	2002-02-13	18	6	12

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1V6E8V5UZ9P3D	RD	&quot;Above all...this is a story about love&quot; - Remember those words.First the movies faults: the plain and simple fact is that this is NOT a traditional musical. The dancing sequences are very short and the music too take very stilted roles. Luhrman's use of the camera is, of course, very stylized and on occasion distracting (I have personally never been a fan of Luhrman's signature frantic camera/cut pace). The sets are extraoridnarily built but very poorly explored, mainly due to Lurhman's sequence pacing.And yet, this is the best movie that I have seen since 1997's &quot;American History X&quot; (my major contemporary fav).Every single negative review I have read has cited the faults of the movie that I have touched on above...but they're all losing sight of what this movie is suppose to be...a love story! The music and camera work are merely supporting members of the cast...the backdrop on which this canvas is painted.Lurhman has created the one of great love story of our time and it all goes back to the tragic lovers (i.e.- Romeo &amp; Juliet). The tragedy is exquisitely structured and poignantly executed. The acting in this movie is absolutely breath-taking...on everyone's part, especially Ewan McGregor. I've been watching his career since Trainspotting and it is truly amazing how much talent this guy has.True, the music may not be the absolute best in the history of musicals (and not original either), but it is the EMOTION behind the singing that makes it so moving. &quot;Your Song&quot; is one of the best ballads I've ever heard recorded (and I am a DJ btw), but it's Roxanne that must take the prize for emotional effort. Just listen to their voices...really listen and you can hear the tortured characters coming through.This all culminates into a story that is so emotionally engrossing that all the technical and musical short-coming are totally drowned out by the sheer force of the tragedy you are seeing on screen.After all, this is a story about love...not music and camera angles...	5.0	&quot;above all, this is a story about love&quot;	2001-09-26	3	3	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1LDIMQISH07WK	Rebecca	MOULIN ROUGE was a beautiful film...it wasn't just another sappy love story. I rented the DVD and watched it with my family. They all thought it was great! Though at the end, my family didn't stay to watch all of the DVD special features...I watched them though so I could review this DVD. Now I know where all these good reviews are coming from. What I don't understand is where all these bad reviews are coming from. What's not to like about MOULIN ROUGE? It has it all: comedy, music, dance, romance, drama...I could go on. Plus, the sceneary is absolutely breathtaking, and the actors are a joy to watch.The film takes place in 1900 Paris, France. The Moulin Rouge is a theatre where a performer's dreams can come true. It's a theatre where the rich come to watch fantastic, thrilling shows and have a good time. There, Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a poor writer, who's never fallen in love before. Christian gets a private interview with the beautiful Satine (Nicole Kidman) who will do anything to become a star. Satine is supposed to marry the Duke (who owns the Moulin Rouge), because he is the one who can make her a star. But when Satine meets Christian, she falls in love with him...and he falls in love with her. Now, they must hide their forbidden love from the Duke, who would become incredibly jealous if he found out about their affair.Never had I imagined that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman could sing! Ewan McGregor's vocals are especially strong and powerful, and he pulls off all his songs very well. Nicole Kidman is also just as flawless as a singer. She definitely can carry a tune--her vocals fit perfectly with Ewan McGregor's. The music is enchanting, and the best song is probably &quot;Come What May&quot;. The costumes and sceneary are also incredible pieces of art.The DVD is just as amazing. There are 2 discs, and they come together in a beautiful box. The special features include the music videos of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; by Christina Aguilera, Pink, Mya, and Lil' Kim, &quot;Come What May&quot; by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, and the full MTV Movie Awards performance of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. Other special features are the making of MOULIN ROUGE, interviews with director Baz Luhrmann, stars Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, and other members of the cast. Also gives an insight on the dance numbers, the cast of MOULIN ROUGE, and more. The picture and sound quality are excellent, too.I highly recommend this film to everyone...not just musical lovers. It's a must-own DVD!	5.0	MOULIN ROUGE!	2002-02-20	6	5	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2BUGOG1JMLK0	"Rebecca ""lotrgrl9"""	Moulin Rouge! is a wonderfully inventive musical from director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann. It is the captivating tale of Christian, (Ewan McGregor) a British poet who takes up residence in turn-of-the-century Paris which is at the height of the Bohemian revolution. He falls in love with Satine, (Nicole Kidman) a courtesan with aspirations of becoming a famous actress. She falls in love with Christian but their happiness is not allowed to endure because of a jealous duke (Richard Roxburgh) who covets Satine.My first thought when watching the opening scenes of Moulin Rouge! was that this film was quite unusual. I gave it a chance because the story, aside from being a classic romance underneath all the glitter, was unique and the film was presented in such a manner that it was unlike anything I had seen before. The marvelous way in which this film is pieced together gives it a style and flare all its own. Although at times, Moulin Rouge! may seem over-the-top, its lavish set design, costuming, and even the acting is intoxicatingly rich. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman shine in their roles, creating such a strong sense of passion and devotion between the two leading characters.One thing that I find irritating in cinema is when a film designates the setting in a specific time period, yet it uses music or makes references to people or events that would not appear in society until sometime in the future; such is the case in Moulin Rouge! The musical takes place in Paris in the year 1900, except many of the musical numbers contain modern songs. Some may see using music from Madonna or Nirvana in a period film as innovative, but I feel it is out of place.It feels as if there is a ceaseless air of gloominess throughout Moulin Rouge! However, it enhances, not diminishes the overall quality and tone of the film. To outdo the uniqueness of Moulin Rouge! future filmmakers will surely have to step up to the plate.	4.0	"""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love!"""	2004-06-07	1	1	0

It's a fantastic / fantastical movie that is a strange and fun musical romp.  There was good chemistry between MacGregor and Kidman, and I didn't think that the movie suffered from lack of plot.  It wasn't The Usual Suspects, but it wasn't meant to be.  The cinematography is very stylized, but it all works within the context of what's happening.  The sets are opuluent, the cast is great, and the music is just fun.  You'll find yourself laughing over and over.  Roxanne and Like A Virgin were great moments.  It really is well-worth going to see if you are of an age that you have 70's and 80's music permanently ingrained in your memory.  I will buy the DVD as soon as it's out.	5.0	A visual rollercoaster of pleasing proportions	2001-07-08	1	1	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AN77A02ME9W57	ReeQueen	Moulin Rouge - from start to finish - is what every other movie aspires to be.  With flash, with (yes!) spectacle, this movie (not &quot;film&quot;) entertains and reminds us that we are in a theater, watching and enjoying ourselves.  De Mille must be green with envy, wherever he is.The DVD doesn't do too badly, either.  All the extra bits can lead one astray, if one is not very, very, careful.  I got lost in the costume stills, myself, but that is my own personal obsession.Baz Luhrman and the team that supports him in his dream, making movies, shows no fear in painting a world that doesn't exist, but one that might have existed - if only someone had followed the Green Fairy, perhaps.  This is what has made Luhrman unique in his endeavours, this lack of fear in doing what he knows is necessary to realize his ideal.  The results have been wondrous, from Strictly Ballroom to Romeo + Juliet to Moulin Rouge.Juxtaposing contemporary music with period location, sets, and costumes adds another layer of story-telling and grabs the attention of the audience.  Immediately there is a connection, no matter who in the audience feels that this juxtaposition may be taking things a bit too far (not me!  taking things too far often isn't far enough).  It also frees up set and costume design, in that anachronism becomes just another method of highlighting a character or place in the story.The story itself is over the top, more than a fairytale, Gothic in romance, grand in scale, but ultimately simple in message.  It keeps reminding us that we are the watchers, not the participants.  We are the people the message is being brought to, and all the song and glory is for us, so we will remember the message forever.	5.0	The Movies' Movie.....	2001-12-28	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"This is a story about life.  And about the artists who congregated in Paris in 1900, living a bohemian lifestyle and giving the world the fruits of their labor, of their art, for which they would gladly bleed and die.  But mostly this is a story about love.  Of a young man named Christian, a penniless writer, and a singer named Satine, who for a moment came together and tasted the nectar of the gods.  ""Moulin Rouge,"" written and directed by Baz Luhrmann, takes you into a world that is bright and brilliant, fast and flashy and filled with all of the things that make life worth living.  It's a fantasy world of song and color, of soaring hearts and aspirations-- but also of the reality upon which the illusion of it all is built.  And the effects of that reality on Christian and Satine, whose love has been forbidden by that same reality they seek to dispel by impaling it with the artistic endeavors that give them life.If Disney had commissioned a film to be written by Shakespeare, directed by Fellini and produced by Spielberg, this would be it.  It's a dizzying, whirling burst of lights, colors, music, drama and comedy that assails the senses and will hold you spellbound from beginning to end.  Like the bohemians he portrays, Luhrmann leaves convention behind and dips instead into his own inspired and highly imaginative formula to tell his story.  The cinematography (by Donald McAlpine) and art direction (by Ann-Marie Beauchamp and Ian Gracie) are brilliant, as well as the production design (by Catherine Martin) and the sets (by Brigitte Broch).  One of the many inspired touches Luhrmann employs here, is the use of different film speeds throughout, which, when combined with the superlative, quick-cut editing (by Jill Bilcock), makes it all transporting and surreal.Ewan McGregor turns is a terrific performance as Christian, the young man who arrives in Paris with nothing more than spirit and a head filled with ideas and ideals.  When artistic differences leaves Zidler (Jim Broadbent), proprietor of the Moulin Rouge, without a writer for a new show, ""Spectacular, Spectacular,"" Christian steps in.  And so does McGregor, who shines in the part.  And the boy can sing!  He may not have the greatest voice in the world, but it's a good ""stage voice,"" and most importantly, he can sell a song, as evidenced by the scene in which he puts across Elton John's ""Your Song.""  McGregor has a charismatic screen presence, and in this role he really gets a chance to demonstrate his versatility as an actor.As Satine, Nicole Kidman is saucy and sensuous, bringing her character vividly to life, this woman who makes her living by being every man's fantasy as she sings and sashays her way through this world of the Moulin Rouge.  In her heart, she longs to be a serious actress, and if this new show is a success, she just may get her chance.  But first, the show needs someone to finance the lavish production.  They may have one-- the Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh), has expressed interest, but he has one condition.  If he pays for the show he wants something in return (besides a profit on his investment).  He wants Satine.  But so does Christian, who has nothing to offer the show but his talent, and nothing for Satine but his love.  Zidler, meanwhile, aware of the Duke's demands, urges Satine to turn her back on Christian, to ""save him.""  And beyond and besides all that is happening, there is something else going on with Satine, something more personal, that ultimately will have an effect on the outcome of the dilemma for all concerned.The supporting cast includes John Leguizamo (Toulouse Lautrec), Kylie Minogue (The Green Fairy), Garry McDonald (Doctor), Jacek Koman (The Narcoleptic Argentinean), Matthew Whittet (Satie), Kerry Walker (Marie) and Laszlo Lukas (Conductor).  With an eye for detail and his imagination thrust into overdrive, Luhrmann has put together and delivered one of the brightest films to come along in quite awhile.  ""Moulin Rouge"" is an explosion of sights and sounds, a film laced with humor and visual largess that holds a poignant and dramatic story at it's heart.  Entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable, this is a memorable film and a satisfying movie-going experience.  It's a story about love; a story told through the magic of the movies."	4.0	A Film About Many Things, But Mostly, Love	2001-06-11	7	6	1

Geatz	Don't get me wrong, there are mind-blowing moments in Moulin Rouge; the visuals alone keep you watching long after you've lost interest in the lame plot.  And it's an interesting idea here to do a sort-of send-up of the movie musical.  But come on, Baz--to stay engaged, we need to care about these characters, and we don't. Again, it's kinda fun to time-trip with music from today set in a turn-of-the-century (the PREVIOUS turn-of-the-century)fantasy, but couldn't you pick some more worthy examples than sappy, early Elton John--especially to be the film's signature song?  Yes, Nicole can sing, but she has little else to do. I'm amazed she got an Oscar nod for this non-performance.  I keep hearing that Moulin Rouge marks the rebirth of the movie musical.  While that might be a good thing, let's hope the next ones out of the gate are better than this dazzling failure.	1.0	The Ultimate Triumph of Style Over Substance	2002-03-10	14	8	6

It's definitely a love or hate film.  I'm not a musical lover or much of a romantic as far as films go (I don't cry in movies often).  All I know is I was a mess at the end of this film and I thought the story was true, honest and beautiful.Ewan and Nicole BOTH should get Oscars for their performances (Ewan got robbed for not at least getting nominated - the boy can SING and act - the last scene alone is amazing).  The story - as simple as it was - was true and honest, which is a lot more than can be said for a lot of films these days.  It was beautiful on levels I didn't know film was capable of.  People who say they didn't empathize with Satine and Christian didn't ""get it"".  Yes - the plot is predictable - Baz SPELLS OUT what will happen in the first 5 minutes.  The beauty of it is that you still care about it by the end.  It doesn't matter that you know what will happen.  It's the journey that is entertaining and meaningful.  The emotional roller coaster - starting so low - shooting high so quickly and slowly falling back to the deepest low is the point of the film in my opinion.On first viewing, I was skeptical for about the first 20 minutes, but I gave in and loved it.  As an artist, I feel this film is an accomplishment of amazing proportion.  The art direction, cinematography, editing, etc is just astounding.  My first thought upon leaving the theater was ""It's the bravest film I've ever seen"" and I'll stand by that today having seen it about 8 times.  For someone to have that vision and realize it so fully must have taken a lot of determination.  It seems Baz definitely got his vision on film and hats off to him for it.  It's the most beautiful film I've ever seen and redefines the medium of ""filmmaking"".See it.  And give it a chance.  Go in with an open mind and heart.  It's worth it."	5.0	The bravest film I've ever seen - beautiful!!!!!	2002-03-13	5	3	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3JRNYGVZOYZR9	Ria N.	"I absolutely LOVE this movie so I couldn't wait for the DVD version to come out.  And oh boy, I was in for a treat.I couldn't help seeing the movie over and over again.  It's about this young poet who falls in love with a courtesan of the Moulin Rouge.  Ewan MacGregor, as the poet, really did a great job in portraying this character.  He has such a wonderful voice that even I fell in love with him, as did Nicole Kidman who played the courtesan.  Nicole Kidman also did a fantastic job.  I couldn't believe she had a great voice (go figure!).  The whole cast was perfect.  The direction, the cinematography, the choreography, the costumes were also all spectacular.  As Ewan MacGregor stated, ""it's really a feast for the eyes!""  Bazz Luhrmann, the director, producer and co-writer, really did an amazing piece of work.The 2nd disc also had the dances that weren't fully featured in the film.  I really love the choreography and it was good that they were able to put it in.  In addition to the extended version, you are able to see it at different angles of the camera.  So you get to fully enjoy the twists and turns of the tango and the cancan.This is really a wonderful movie.  I know some people didn't think that it was any good but if they could just be open-minded I know they'll change their minds."	5.0	It should be 10 stars!!	2002-01-20	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A34R82FXSUCOJ0	Richard Hawkins	"I've seen this film 12 times now (8 at the cinema and 4 at home with the DVD) and it is still a great joy and delight to me.  If I try and analyse why I'm so in love with it - or why it's such a great film - I end up realising that a logical, critical approach doesn't work, and I'm left with the thought that Moulin Rouge is a modern equivalent to a 30s MGM musical: I almost feel that I'm a closet gay man and that the story of Satine and Christian and the Duke and Harold and Toulouse is, when all is said and done, nothing less than ""fabulous"".  Critical faculties, and the ability to maintain a detached or ironic perspective, are shattered by glamour, pathos, gorgeous orchestral music, truth, beauty, freedom and, above all, love.In some ways it's easier to see what's wrong with the film rather than what's so good about it: the story is spare and simple (and corny); there's an excess of frenetic cutting (one Australian reviewer likened watching it to being trapped in an elevator with a circus); and some of the more complex scenes (the ""Roxanne"" sequence, and the massive ""Hindi sad diamonds"" denouement) almost fall apart under their own weight; but these are minor concerns when placed against the sheer emotionalism and filmic energy of this crazy masterpiece.  Baz Luhrmann has defiantly established himself as a genius -- in an audacious pantheon of genius that includes Jimi Hendrix, Charlie Parker and Orson Welles.An example of Luhrmann's brilliant touch is his deft combination of humour and pathos: right in the middle of the film's funniest scene (the most outrageous, burlesque take on ""Like a Virgin"" you'll ever see) he cuts to a deathly-pale Satine being injected after fainting (I'm not giving anything away -- it is revealed to us at the beginning that Satine is doomed).  The music abruptly changes from the Rogers and Hammerstein-like treatment of ""Virgin"" to a few plaintive notes on the piano backed by a muted and ominous orchestra, then it's back to the madness of the Duke and Zidler.  Another example is during the movie's love theme, ""Come What May"": we see Eric Satie joined by an ever-increasing number of bald men, sitting around a piano playing a hauntingly sad and spare Satie-ish melody, before we return to the climax of the love song (and once again Luhrmann demonstrates his brilliant touch: this dramatic part of the song is sung in rehearsal, with Satine and the narcoleptic Argentinean in costume, contrasted by numerous extras, stage-hands and sundry others wandering around).Moulin Rouge is the film where Nicole Kidman really comes into her own.  ""The Others"" has reinforced her standing as an exceptional film actress, but in that film she was playing a restricted, neurotic character.  In Moulin Rouge she runs the gamut of emotions from A to Z: she's beautiful, she's sexy, she's doomed, she's in love.  She is just as striking when her face is presented to us as a vision of grief and despair, tears running down her cheeks, as when she is resplendent in gorgeous stage costumes or her ""seduction outfit"".Nicole is the greatest of the stars but McGregor is very good as the young and idealistic Christian: he has genuine charm when he sings ""Your Song"" to Satine and there is real pathos with his tears at the shock of Satine's death.  Jim Broadbent is perfect as Harold Zidler, the impresario, who is both manipulative and sympathetic.  Richard Roxburgh is hilarious as the Duke but is also able to invest the mainly caddish role with real complexity, as evinced by his dejected posture after uttering ""My dear, a little frog"" to a besotted Satine: while he is the nasty villain - ""a powerful man"" with a homicidal manservant Warner - he displays some of the vulnerability of being in love.  Those four - Satine, Christian, the Duke and Harold, are the main characters, but John Leguizamo is charmingly affecting as Toulouse-Lautrec (another small gripe I have with the scenario is that we are never reminded that Toulouse was a painter and a very great painter at that), and there are some juicy cameos by Garry McDonald (who utters the classic line ""I don't think a nun would say that about a hill"") and David Wenham, unrecognisable sans beard and with a black wig.The music is luscious and a real delight: ""Nature Boy"" is all pathos and even dread; ""Your Song"" is sweepingly romantic and thrilling; ""The Pitch"" is spirited mayhem; ""One Day I'll Fly Away"" is simply stunningly gorgeous; ""Elephant Love Medley"" is excitingly surprising as we recognise the post-modernist take on such pop classics as ""Heroes"" and ""I Will Always Love You"" (on top of that, Luhrmmann chucks in operatic flourishes willy-nilly); ""Like a Virgin"" is a burlesque masterpiece; ""Come What May"" is anthemic, corny and irresistible; and ""Hindi Sad Diamonds"" is a thumping dance track set against the most stunning tableau you'll ever see staged.It's important to get the DVD for the quality of sound and vision.  The extras are many and good but nothing beats just sitting down again, to share with another friend, the joy of this great movie.  I'm looking forward to the next ""screening"" already!"	5.0	A thrilling, audacious masterpiece	2002-02-04	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1E8WJF8Z9HC08	Richard Heyworth	Online Amazon Community,I feel very compelled, almost driven to, to tell you how great a movie this is. I see that some people loved it and some people hated it. It's not for everyone but if you are open to it like Christian says in one scene, you might thoroughly enjoy it. Are you open to freedom, beauty, truth and most importatnly love? That is the basic question this movie asks. Can you get beyond the use of bad songs used to see beneath the surface? I never saw this movie because I don't love McGregor and Kidman and because I had heard about the use of pop music and since I am a professional musician of sorts I was turned off from the start. But I want to tell you to do yourself a favor and rent this movie. You will fall in love with it just like I have.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2VNI5T09D5UXX	Richard Jamison	I had given up on Hollywood ever making a magical movie like those of yesteryear. I am 57 so I know what film used to be. I tend to watch independent cinema. However, a friend of mine suggested this movie to me because of its associations with Tibetan Buddhism, which I practice. The wonderful reviews that discuss how the movie is itself playing on the many levels of esoteric art are extremely perceptive. That is what seems like such an accomplishment. Taken as a whole, the movie is a mandela as the reviewers say. As a public interest advocate, I also appreciate the message about the pitfalls of materialism.George Bush should be forced to watch this movie and learn something or two about love. Better yet, make a gay or Lesbian version and make him watch that.	5.0	A New Hollywood Classic	2004-10-14	6	3	3
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2TUGXYUVOS9VV	Richard J Duke	This is definitely one of the most individual and original movies I have ever seen, and it actually warrants multiple viewings, but only if you are truly interested in cinema. Because after three times watching this (masterpiece? mess?) I still cannot decide what I think of it.There is some great work here. This is not like anything you have seen before. The editing, the set design, the photography is not for everyone, but it is what it is. You cannot really say that it is bad. He acheived exactly what he wanted to. In a world of cookie cutter films where the most mundane ideas are transformed into bland, passive entertainment, this film dares you to like it on its own terms.And yet...How can a film that is so dazzling to look at have the most boring dialog ever? I can understand how the story is kept simple. These kinds of films (Titanic, etc.) need to be because it is more about the emotion than the story. But, the words coming out of these actors' mouths are just plain dull. Nothing quotable. You don't ever sit around and quote Moulin Rouge. Heck, the only thing that people ever do quote is the line from &quot;Nature Boy&quot; (The only thing you'll ever learn...).The film takes big missteps in several key scenes, most of all with the initial love scenes between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, mainly the absolutely horrible medley of love songs that they sing to each other. A moment that should take us to the next level ala Leo Dicaprio sketching Kate Winslet, but it falls flat. Kidman trying to be funny in her first scene with McGregor and later with the Duke are totally miscalculated. You just stare at the screen and wonder when the scene will end.Better moments include Jim Broadbent singing &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and the final love song with Kidman and McGregor, which actually acheives what the the entire movie tries to--a moment of magic.I applaud all involved for swinging for the fences on this one. Baz Luhrman needs to hire a screenwriter who can write memorable dialogue, and believe it or not, he needs to get a better editor, so that he can excise some scenes entirely instead of just using him to cut, cut, cut.An incredibly interesting film, not a big success, but also not a failure. We at least need more efforts like this.	3.0	Highly original, but far from great	2002-10-01	12	10	2

I bought this movie because I LOVE musicals (whether on Broadway or in movie form). This is by far one of the most disappointing musicals I have yet seen.  There is basically no story line, no central characters and no REAL plot. This movie was just a jumble of special effects, overdone sets (not realistic, kind of cartoon-like) and over the top and overdone costumes. I forced myself to watch it half-way through hoping it would get better as the story progressed, but what you see in the beginning is what you get throughout the entire movie. Needless to say, I stopped watching it half-way through and donated the dvd to charity. I wonder if THEY kept it?	1.0	Pure Absurdity	2013-09-14	7	2	5

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3R2XVL3WU1SKK	R. K. Agreda	I really don't like writing reviews, but for this blu-ray I just HAVE to.As a HUGE Moulin Rouge! fan (I've seen it 54 times... yes, I'm a crazy person, hehe) I can tell you that this blu-ray transfer is beyond perfect.When I bought it I knew it was gonna look great. I mean, this movie was made for blu-ray. But boy! did I underestimated its power?The image is crystal clear and the colors pop like nothing you've ever seen. All the blues are bright royal blue. The reds look extra passionate. And the blacks are extraordinarily deep. The amount of grain is just perfect. And the image is so sharp you can see everything from the smallest scratch on the floor, to the tiniest crack on the walls, to the pores on the actors skins and even the small veins in Kidman's eyes.The sound is rich and absolutely delicious. You can hear every.single.whisper in the background. And the music sounds even better.The extras are the same as those in the DVD Collector's Edition, so they're great and a lot.And well, I won't even begin to describe the movie itself cause you could get 50 pages or more of me describing how amazing and perfect it is. So I'll just stick to the quality of the transfer and disc.I have enjoyed a large variety of blu-rays which looked absolutely stunning (Kung Fu Panda, Wall-E, Ratatouille, Pirates of The Caribbean, etc.), but I've never seen anything like this.I have a 46-inch TV so the quality of the image sometimes suffers a tiny bit because of the size, but with this blu-ray I didn't perceive the tiniest flaw.So, if you really wanna completely enjoy the full capacities of your Full HD TV, this is the disc to buy.I'm still in awe of how perfect everything looked and sound.A must-have for any Moulin Rouge! fan, any movie fan, and any HD fan.	5.0	Stunning, Mind Blowing, Jaw Dropping Full HD Experience!	2011-01-01	24	24	0

It's slapstick and serious and musical and dramatic, all at the same time. And best of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously. With all of the &quot;art&quot; film that's been made over the last 20 years, it's nice to see a movie that's just plain fun and still takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. Plenty of eye candy for Gen-Xer's too. The music was well scored and arranged and cleverly integrated to fit the story line. Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor are surprising and the chemistry was wonderful. I plan to get this on DVD as soon as it's available.

It doesn't merely consist of clich&eacute;s:  It exults in clich&eacute;s.Flashing lights, quick cuts like you've never seen -- just the thing for stupefied youths reared on SESAME STREET and MTV.

The Blu-ray accentuates the colorful sets that were given a lot of attention in the production of this film.  Some of the dance scenes are simply spectacular and the sound is outstanding on high-quality sound equipment.  Much of the music is popular songs from the recent past that have been reworked in very good ways.  The romantic, bohemian love story is entertaining, Kidman and McGregor do a very good job, and some of the supporting characters are great -- the Count is soooo funny, even after several viewings of the movie.  I'm glad my daughter turned me on to this film, I've had a lot of fun watching it a few times.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A361LE16VBQDP8	Robert Bezimienny	Given the conservative nature of most current mainstream films, Moulin Rouge has been rightly applauded for taking cinematic risks.  However, the simple taking of risks is not, in itself, a guarantee of great cinema and, for mine, the thinking behind this film is confused and ultimately unsatisfying.*On my first viewing, the blinding tempo of the editing, with shots often lasting less than a second, was startling;  it was also physically irritating.  Certainly, it's unusual for the big screen, but it's also redolent of formulaic video clips on MTV or the like - hoardes of box stepping dancers, with the star attraction up front, all digitalised jump cuts and jitter - we have, actually, seen this before.  So it's not so unusual after all, and the question then becomes, does this technique add to the viewing experience? ( Which is close to asking whether one wants to see a two hour long dance video clip.)  I think the elaborate sets and spectacle would have been even more impressive if normal editing techniques had been employed.  More crucially, the main characters might have established more of an emotional connection with the audience, so that when tragedy strikes later in the film, something approaching a catharsis might transpire.  The excitement generated by the opening seems artificial, one distraction layered upon the other, until the characters and the story are lessened, if not lost, instead of being heightened.*There is extensive use of models and CGI to allow otherwise impossible shots of the cityscape of period Paris.  The opening is thus visually arresting but, in principle, this has been done before (go back to Olivier's Henry V from 1944 for one example) - the digital 'flying camera' technique is then repeated several times, until its impact is diminished, and this again reminds of images routinely used and reused in music video clips.*In the commentaries, the writers, Baz Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, seem convinced that the crashing together of different genres and disparate elements is inherently a good thing.  I think they have failed in judging what elements complement and mutually elevate each other, in contrast to those which merely intrude and detract from the work as a whole.  There's the feeling that if another association occurred to them, they forced it in, and that the paring down process was not guided by a single strong vision.  They sound a little too enamoured of their own brilliance. It's particularly telling when they come to discuss the final scenes - in terms of story resolution, they admit that they were unsure how to end the film: the story was unclear in their own minds, and yet throughout the commentary they have been paying lip-service to the idea that everything must be subservient to the needs of the story - in the commentary they bluster through the inconsistencies, but you can hear their confidence wane.*In a way, you can hardly blame them.  An enormous amount of money was thrown at this film, and Lurhmann and co. must have been surrounded by lackeys all too ready to canonise them as creative geniuses.  You wonder who was around to challenge their ideas on artistic (as opposed to economic) grounds.  So when Baz suggests combining French bedroom farce, with the operatic tragedy of La Boheme, themes taken from nineteenth century French novellas with the whimsy of Hollywood musicals, nobody is there to ask whether all these elements combine well or combine badly.*So overall, there are numerous incongruent elements struggling for the viewer's attention and sympathy:  there are comedic elements - but they make the mistake of not being humorous;  there are tragic elements, but the tragedy hardly seems tragic; there are sexual elements which stop short of being sexy; opera with the melodramatic action but no Mozart or Puccini to lift this musically towards the sublime - although it is lifted sufficiently (by Madonna Ciccone and Reginald Dwight et al) to be passable as entertainment.*It's as if two chefs decided to create a new dish by combining a large number of tried and tested ingredients into the one big pot.  None of the produce is particular fresh, and copious spices are required to disguise this fact.  After two hours on the boil, the dish is ready, and lo and behold, it's a kind of casserole - unfortunately, one that's likely to leave the discerning viewer with an upset stomach.	3.0	Indigestion	2002-03-07	16	7	9

However, was always an avid fan of Nicole Kidman. And on Ewan McGregor, I was an agnostic. Now after watching the Moulin Rouge DVD, I am a believer of all three.I won't say that this movie is for everyone. But anyone who likes the theater and opera is sure to like this movie. Excellent scenary (although not real). Excellent tunes. Nicole sings almost as well as she looks! McGregor sings much better than he looks. If you saw the movie, you know what I'm talking about.

After watching this film I was actually proud to be an Aussie for a few days. Although Baz Lurhman sounds like a typically shallow pretentious Sydney boy that good and honest Novocastrians like myself despise, he's actually incredibly clever.  There are moments of sheer, blinding beauty that are overwhelming. The use of the music is incredible and the arrangements of the songs are novel and exciting. As for the editing, at no point was it anything but thrilling. The visual narrative is sumptuous. Ewan Macgregor and Nicole Kidman are luminous; I actually teared up twice not because it was sad but because it's so damn gorgeous. The film is also incredibly funny and just plain fun to sit through. I saw it 3 days ago and I'm still thrilled to bits about it. I kept thinking, at last this is a musical for me, for my generation unburdened by traditional musical theatre narrative, so inventive.  Robbie Hudson	5.0	Thank God for Lurhmann	2001-05-28	31	25	6
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2EIAVJI03V1US	Robert Fox	"This movie is definitely one of the best I've seen in a long time, and I have to take issue with R.P. McCosker's review.  How can this movie ""go to show the decline of our culture,"" yet Legally Blonde is ""Good Silly Fun?""  I prefer to think of the success of a movie like Moulin Rouge as more of an indicator of a culture that can appreciate art.Everything about this movie, from costume design, to set design, to music and dialog comes together in a truly awe-inspiring display.  It's worth watching more than once (if just to catch the little things most will miss the first time through), and the music will be stuck in your head long after the movie ends.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor should be applauded for being brave enough to take on a project like this.  While I won't expect to see either actor leave Hollywood in pursuit of a music career, I was surprised to hear how good they really are.  The use of their own voices for the singing parts helps to keep the story cohesive, and allows for a seamless transition from song to spoken word that couldn't be done with a voice double.The choice of songs was outstanding, with representations from many different musical genres and eras.  It's not often you can put Smells Like Teen Spirit, Like a Virgin, Your Song, and Come What May together and get something so fluid.  Not only did the songs serve to bring the decadent, 19th century bohemian movement into modern times, as well as truly further the story, but I found myself more fully understanding the same songs I'd been hearing for years, yet never really listened to.  I'll never again hear Your Song or Roxanne the same way again.The editing was excellent, and the sometimes manic cuts from shot to shot within a scene (like the opening Can Can scene, or the final production scene), or between two scenes happening simultaneously (the Roxanne scene) gave a heightened sense of emotion, and let the audience feel a little of the excitement that the characters would have felt.This isn't a movie for the attention-deficit crowd, and it isn't a movie for people that like 2-hour rock videos.  This is a movie for anyone that enjoys art, music, and love."	5.0	A genuine bedazzlement.	2003-03-31	1	1	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AGZVS6M8XJGN6	"Roberto Frangie ""Robert"""	"Luhrmann's flamboyant musical 'Moulin Rouge' is a combination of Camille, La Boh&egrave;me and Showgirls... The film swings easily between present and past, among so many wildly different moods: farce, tragedy, romance, satire, comedy and rock and roll...'Moulin Rouge' is an assault on the senses, a non stop visual explosion, an exotic trip, and a love story that is sure to touch your heart... It is a gloriously cinematic spectacle with opulent imagery directed with an eye for rich color, especially the color of rouge... It is also a breathtaking and poignant piece of cinema, a disco of dreams, a crazy and daring show, a vibrant screen fantasy, a ""Bohemian Revolution,"" a magical movie for those who love romance, pop music and old musical movies...Nicole Kidman gives the film its soul... She is the ""sparkling diamond"" of the show, the toast of Paris, the city's top courtesan... She melts her characterization with a sizzling, yet tender, performance... She is undeniably sexy, a beautiful singer, a flashy dancer whose heart sings whenever she sees Christian... In many ways, she is drawn as the ultimate sex goddess, as enigmatic as Greta Garbo, and her glamor masks her pain as well as her happiness... Kidman gives the film its central erotic charge, and its romantic thrills... She sways on a flying trapeze belting out Marilyn Monroe's ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,"" and Madonna's ""Material Girl.""Ewan McGregor achieves a nice mix of optimism and desperation, emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet-hero... Christian is a young idealist who moves to the bohemian section of Paris during the 'summer of love' of 1899... He is hired to write a show about 'truth, beauty, freedom and, most of all, love.' Christian battles for the body and soul of the ravishing Satine... His fundamental believe is 'the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and to be loved in return...John Leguizamo is vulnerable and sweet as Henri de Toulouse Lautrec needing a good writer to come up with story and lyrics for his new show called ""Spectacular Spectacular.""Jim Broadbent is wonderfully comic as the ringmaster Harold Zidler... He is a jovial impresario who peddles the charms of a successful Satine to a mesmerized public... He is the owner of the infamous nightclub who has promised Satine to the evil Duke of Monroth... He has his eye on her too...Richard Roxburgh is odious as the jealous benefactor obsessed with Satine to the point of murder... He is stunningly arrogant wanting the gorgeous can-can chanteuse in an ""exclusive contract.""Luhrmann combines 1900 Can Can burlesque with modern musical poetry, exploiting Kidman's grace and beauty and overwhelming the audience with frenetic dance numbers delivered in operatic-style... Like Orson Welles, Luhrmann loves the technical magic of movies... When a red curtain opens, an orchestra conductor emerges to direct the unmistakable '20th Century Fox' theme opening, we immediately realize we're in for something really magical: A spectacular costume revue, an eye-catching fin de si&egrave;cle exuberance, an inspiring rebirth of the movie musical..."	4.0	An inspiring rebirth of the movie musical...	2007-01-08	5	5	0

Just rent anything else, eat 6 candy bars, drink a case of Coke, and be sure to watch whatever you rent on fast forward. There, you have the general experience. Try to have a few photos of Nicole Kidman nearby, too, to calm yourself down occasionally. To be fair, the film must have been a nightmare to make and edit, and Luhrmann has done an estimable job with that, but it's ultimately one of those experiments that I'm not sure anyone had to really make. If AMPAS had to give this film any Oscar attention, it should've acted in reverse.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1MN1Y3QNUFRBE	"Robert W. Berg ""Rob"""	I am absolutely in love with &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot; I have loved movies but I have not been IN love with a movie to this degree since I was two or three years old and I saw &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; for the first time. Much like &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; this is an incredibly magical movie. In fact, it is not just a movie, but an awe-inspiring experience of cinematic art the likes of which have never been seen before.What is &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;? It's a grand opera, a pop/rock spectacle, a heartbreaking love story, a dazzling fantasy of epic proportions, a dizzying ride through a mythical version of Paris. Blending every cinematic technique known to man, which are all then turned on their heads, Baz Luhrmann has created the best movie I have ever seen.  After seeing &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Strictly Ballroom,&quot; I thought the  man had potential, but had not yet found the right story or movie to display his unique visual talents.  After seeing &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; I know he has finally become a great director.And what of the actors? Ewan McGregor is perfect as the lovelorn, penniless poet, Christian.  And he has a singing voice that will absolutely knock your socks off. And then there's Nicole...oh Nicole...what can I say about Nicole? This is without a doubt the best performance of her career thus far.  She is funny, insane, bubbly, but also sad. And she herself proves to have an extremely sweet, beautiful voice herself. And the chemistry between the two is absolutely amazing. I have never truly believed two movie characters were in love as much as these two: their passion enflames the screen.What would a great musical be without music? &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; has plenty of that.  It has an absolutely brilliant score, which uses over thirty modern-day pop and rock classics, and turns them into the stuff of opera and showtunes.  Believe me, you will never hear songs such as &quot;Like a Virgin,&quot; &quot;Roxanne,&quot; or &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; the same way ever again.This movie has everything: an amazing story, perfect acting...and some of the most striking visual imagery I have ever seen in any movie. There are some moments of this film where my jaw just dropped. I can not describe how beautiful this film is.  But, beyond the visual acrobatics, this movie has substance. It attempts to examine what being in love truly is, and it succeeds. I never cry at movies, but I cried at the end of this movie.When I saw this movie in New York City during its limited release, before its countrywide release, I fell in love. The audience burst into applause at the end of each song, as if they were actually at a live musical or opera.  At the end, the movie, the director, Nicole, and Ewan got a standing ovation. How often does a movie inspire that type of response? I would recommend that everybody buy, not rent, &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot; There are so many moments in this film you will want to watch over and over again.	5.0	The best movie of 2001...and of the last 10 years	2001-09-01	0	0	0

At times, the effects seemed sureal, as if the movie crew was suffering from a collective migrane durring the conception and production of this team.Even the pairing of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor (who really do deserve credit for trying to make something out of the story) could not save this vastly overrated production from collapsing in it's own excesses. Considering much of the prepublicity billed the film as a nostalgia period piece, some of the selections such as Elton John (and certainly Nirvana) are truly puzzling.	1.0	This was a joke right..	2002-02-11	27	15	12

She sizzles in Lurhmann's dazzling, sometimes frustrating movie musical that attempts to jump-start a 21st century version of a story set in the infamous Parisian night club.Boundaries are shattered and time warps in the fast cutting frenzy that blends music and even technologies from different eras.""Moulin Rouge"" is kaleidoscopic, absinthe-inspired orgy of extraordinary sets, dazzling costumes, snippets of amazing tunes and incredible digital wizardry all finessed into what lingers as an ephemeral memory of a lucid dream that brushes up against the promise of ecstasy."	4.0	A LUCID DREAM'S EPHEMERAL PROMISE OF ECTASY	2010-11-21	2	1	1

I thought it was down and just kept posting. Kind of freaky to see all of them at once. Can I erase them? NOTE to Amazon. Com: I did other reviews and I hope they didn't triplicate too. Please fix your system!!!!!!!!!!!!I have wanted to get around to writing a review of this terrific movie for a long time. I have kept hearing a voice telling me to honor the effect this movie has had on me in the past year. On this sunny morning, I have decided to do just that!I was first introduced to Moulin Rouge when it first came out. I saw it with someone to whom I was engaged at the time. We went to see it because we missed another movie. I fell asleep at the time. It just seemed so much, too many visuals and very schizophrenic. I couldn't handle it. I assumed the movie epitomized everything that I think is wrong with American culture and Hollywood.Flash forward to this summer. My new partner mentions to me that we should rent this movie. I have a violent reaction and absolutely forbid it! My arms are flailing, I'm stopping my feet on the ground and yelling ""NO WAY!"". In all of her wisdom, my new partner ignores me and rents the movie anyway. I am annoyed. She asks me why I am so against this movie. She says that I totally misunderstood the movie the first time or worse. She suggests that my ego was preventing me from appreciating the movie's religious significance. I am a Buddhist and she is a christian unitarian type. She mentions some reviews of the movie I should read. I read the reviews on here and the one on Hollywood Jesus dot com. I am blown away! I am almost ashamed at my blindness and my obvious unwillingness to be stretched to greater understanding and awareness. I was being a total stubborn snob and my partner is just much better at suspending disbelief.This movie has made me better able to appreciate the teachings I follow in day to day life. When I react badly to what Hindus call the manifestations of the Kali Yuga, I remember this movie. I remember that my disposition must be one of courage and lovingness and not just hot air, judgment and anger.I am definitely interested in learning more about Baz Luhrmann, Craig Pierce and Catherine Martin and their own spiritual journeys. I am officially intrigued how Hollywood people could produce one of my top 5 religious experiences in the past several years. That list includes meeting the Dalai Lama at a benefit for Tibet House!Thank you to the makers of this movie and to all of you out there who possess the insight, wisdom and patience to have helped me see it for what it really is underneath.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1T9K1ZH2W18FC	Rodolfo Justine	Moulin Rouge is an experiment. Films daring at being bold, new and fresh are the most audacious since it has very much to risk, it stands on shaky ground. This movie is the proof of it. Visually interesting, funny to an extent, a mega crew, handsome actors and what seems to be, I believe miles of edited film; this movie is well crafted in terms of just that: craft. One can not say it is a bad movie, or poorly acted, because it is not; yet to believe it to be something more than an experiment and raise to Oscar level is as hallucinatory as the movie and its director.On the other side, at the first ten minutes of movie, the director lets us in the story and from very short one is aware of the sequence of events and the main plot of the screenplay; making the almost next two hours unbearable to watch and provinding very little new or surprasing events in the plot. Nicole Kidman is well articulated, nice, her singing is well performed, yet very &quot;withing herself&quot;, since the writer has offered very little possibility for real acting, this film`s gendre dwells more on the cabaret-vaudeville one, so exaggeration and excess are the tone. Ewan`s singing is in bad shape. At the lower and middle tones, his voice remains much of its candor, yet at certain levels it is truly annoying: it becomes flat, dull and opaque, he must be two entire tones below the actual pitch and his voice does not blend well with that of his counter part. Thus this movie being a musical and having a bad lead is not good news. To this matter, that of music, the best scene in the movie is that of the number of Roxane. Here true intention, real acting and art are evident.Pity the movie remained at being an experiment and did not trascend above shallow limitation, the director seemed too interested in making his public dizzy by so many unnecessary cuts, angles and there must have been hundreds of cuts by minute; Daz should have researched with a neurologist about the number of scenes and cuts by minute that the human brain can tolerate without reaching dangerous levels.	2.0	Music is gone	2002-02-16	4	3	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1CGF9EUDEUQJA	Rodrigo Medina	Moulin Rouge is surely the best musical of all times. It's contemporary, bright and magical, telling the love story of Satine and Christian. Baz Luhrmann was very competent bringing  &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (the third film of the &quot;Red Curtain&quot; trilogy) to life and did it like no other director could do. It's wonderful the idea of creating a musical with pop songs of the last decades, instead of original songs, not known by the public. &quot;Come what may&quot;, the original love score of this movie, is a great track as well, since it captures all the pain characters go through.The double DVD edition is exactly as I expected when I first watched this movie. It brings all the possible information related to the movie, with high quality and advanced technology. It has director's comments, rehearsal of the can can dance with the cast, interviews with the cast, videos of lady marmalade, etc. The DVD box is awesome, just like the movie.I'm sure Moulin Rouge is a DVD which will please all types of viewers.	5.0	The best musical ever made!	2002-03-10	2	0	2

I enjoyed Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's performances and they're vocal talents were surprising, because they've been so well known for only their acting ability for a long time.

And this person indicated they have had 50 or so years of experience in rating movies. I feel the need to defend this movie. This person's problem may have come from a lack of preference to musicals, or maybe because the movie dealt with some moral issues that in other people's opinions aren't appropriate.It's all a matter of opinion, people!!!

First I could not understand why they didn't come up with original music, they had to borrow from &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot; Are they kidding? Diamonds are Girl's Best Friend? And when did rap come in to play in the 1900's? The camera action was so fast I had to go in to slow play to see what I had missed.I had to turn the volume up to hear what the actors were sayingand then when the music came on it was so loud and I had to turn it down. Actors should take alocution lessons and learn to project their lines so we can understand what they are saying. And as for their singing, Nicole and Ewan sounded like two wimps.Well others may like it, but I am from the old school when musicals were made to be entertaining and the voices could be heard.	2.0	I disagree with most of the comments about this movie	2003-11-08	13	10	3
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AHEOWCWO728H2	"""rougegirl"""	The opening of Moulin Rouge can only be described as electrifying, intensely eye-catching and dazzling! The music, dance, movement and colourful costumes are just amazing and the most glamourous is Nicole Kidman's first appearance and rendition of Diamonds are a girls best friend. The story is somewhat modern but the music would have to be one of the best features, and brings the film to life. Nicole and Ewan's vocals are stunning but my favourite would have to be the costumes; corsets and suspenders underneath beautiful ball gown-style dresses reflecting the glamour of Paris 1899. The love story element may appear to be soppy to some but although the ending is already revealed to you early in the film, the intensity of the final few minutes (after a spectacular show featuring a wonderful performance by both Nicole and Ewan) was enough to leave everyone in the cinema totally speechless, tears in the eyes. Moulin Rouge would have to be one of the best films I have ever seen and Baz Luhrmann is to be congratulated for his work. Ewan's performance was wonderful and it's hard to find a word suitable to describe Nicole's dazzling and unmatchable performance as Satine. Both the director and star turned in wonderful efforts and are both admired and applauded by fellow Australians/Fans.

Admittedly, it is flashy, fast-paced, and bawdy, but these are the things I love about it.  It never gave me a headache, though it has several of my friends.  I think one has to be truly of a Bohemian spirit to enjoy the film like the cult that loves it does.It is a musical about a bordello in Paris in which a young playwrite and the star of the bordello's night club fall in love.  The story follows the typical beats of a musical, though there is a tragic ending.  It is woven brilliantly together through revamped 80's and 90's music that I always hated before.  It is well worth the $$$ amazon.com is selling it for, but it is not for those who like watching Bridges of Madison County.

After the first 1/2 hour SHE wanted to walk out and I suggested that we give it some more time.  We stayed for over an hour but couldn't take the torture one more minute.  This is the FIRST movie either of us has ever walked out of.  I must add that the first movie I ever attended was in 1949!  So between us we have over 100 years of movie-going history to refer to and we've seen some doozies!What a waste of talent (?), costuming and raw film.  There was no story to follow and the acting was horrendous.If there were a minus 5 star category, this film would be it.	1.0	The worst movie we've ever seen!	2001-07-03	28	9	19

Don't forget that the director who also did Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliette studied Bollywood spectacle in order to make Moulin Rouge.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	Baz Lurmann has crafted an intoxicating mess from musicals, movies, pop songs, and romances each of us know by heart.  His movie jumps off the screen, and is unlike any other movie I have ever seen.  No matter how you respond to the truly dizzying camera work, the off-kilter, obvious sets, and the often painfully obvious love story, you cannot deny the spectacular artistic vision of the creator.  To boot, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are enchanting, and they invest 100% into their crossed-lovers roles; they sing (well!) and they look ravishing.  The jaw-dropping arrangements of such familiar pop fare as Your Song, Roxanne, Up Where We Belong, and many, many others, is somehow simultaneously hilarious and entirely appropriate in this anachronistic, created world that has nothing to do with Paris in 1900.  More an over-the-top music video in style and substance than a feature length film, this movie nevertheless does revive the musical film -- the music and the chemistry of the stars draw you in at every turn.  And the tributes paid to the pop poetry of Elton John and many others makes the words and music glow with a new light.  Baz's hat is tipped often to such enduring classics as The Sound Of Music and La Boheme; the choreography and sheer dazzle are often overhwhelming and so glittery and crazily shot that they give you the sensation of being on a rollercoaster that is turning upside down.  To the movie's credit, it is hard to shake the dark, swirling camera from your head once you have been to this Moulin Rouge.	4.0	OUTRAGEOUS	2001-05-25	19	17	2

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1FVD32PB7F98W	R Ray	This movie is a beautiful love story. I love Nicole Kidman as I always have and in this movie she surpassed my expectations. I easily related it to my first and still ever love after over 40 yrs, when I first met Marsha I was 18, and she still is the one for me, though she is married to another she will remain in my heart forever. This movie stirred those longings for my first love. Though some may think the movie was long, I hardly noticed as I enjoyed it so much. I wish I could have seen it on the big screen, but widescreen is good enough. If you like love stories and musicals, you will like this movie.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A10DRJL3NJ4NCC	R. Tan	From an honest audience point of view :I can't believe how rough the story line is and that it still got away from the critics. I wouldn't classify this as a musical, it is simply a film with a few great old songs thrown between the scenes. Nicole looks great and posseses a passable singing voice. The same can be said about Ewan who is well chosen for his part, but his high note became a bit irritating after awhile. But inspite of all this negative criticism, I found the film is visually exciting. I will definitely see it again and again.	3.0	Moulin Rough is a Rough Ride.	2002-01-29	3	0	3

I read some of the reviews discussing the values and the Buddhism in it. I totally agree because I know a little bit about eastern thought.My special person and I have watched this together almost ten times since we got it. I can't believe this didn't get the oscar that year. Also, the fact that Courtney Love almost blocked the use of Teen Spirit is so interesting.

From the black and white poverty-stricken streets of Paris to the frenzied can-can dancing inside the club Mouling Rouge, this film had me mesmerized every second.  I've noticed many people seem to flinch at the frenzied scene changes and peculiar soundtrack. Indeed, this movie is strange.. That's what I love about it. It doesn't adhere to the rules.  It's different and daring and I believe people will get a lot more out of it if they sit back and just go with it. Enjoy it...don't question it.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2FBIF1FKBC193	"Rudolf Spoerer ""dowadiddi"""	I just saw the DVD of Moulin Rouge and was blown away for a couple of reasons. First, I got this very strange feeling that not only do I look like Zidler, the all powerfull owner of the Moulin Rouge and top perv, but I kind of idenbtified with him, and, second, there must be a lot of people that bought the DVD, and, when in the first five minutes realized that there is no crime, there is no killer, no lawyer and the plot is not clear, must have felt that they made a big big mistake ...The movie/musical has all the great elements to be a cult favorite with old perverts enjoying the fruits of life, young nubile dancing women,contemporary song hits blended into the story, and, of course, where would we be without the obligatory  bunch of crazy midgets ....If you enjoy Broadway shows, musicals, operas, or the ballet then you will probably enjoy this wonderfull work of art. The visuals are stunning and the use of popular hits from Elton John, Queen, Madonna et. al. with a period piece, set in the decadent 1900 nightclub Moulin Rouge, not only works but is memorable.Finally, anyone that buys this DVD for the story must be out of their minds and probably never ever saw an opera where I believe they actually give prizes for far fetched stupid stories (the opera La Tutti Van Tutti really comes to mind here) ..... So, if you can withstand operas like that you will love Mounlin Rouge ....	5.0	It's very very easy to understand ..... really	2002-02-01	2	1	1

Everything from the Extras to the DTS track will blow you away.  It's very important to have good sound for a musical, and this is the best one.As for the movie, it's a perrty simple love story...the only catch, is it's set in a early 20th century cabaret.  Ewan McGregor meets a traveling preformers and joins, they then sneek into the Moulin Rouge in attempt to get a job and it's there where he meets Nicole Kidman, the biggest talent at the Moulin Rouge.  They met and then the rest is pertty stright forward.The great thing about this movie is it's first 40 min.  These first min. is full of crazy visuals and great music.....want to see a fat man in a red penguine suit sing Nervina's ""Smells Like Teen Sprit"" in the early 1900's?  Well, you get it here.  As a matter of fact you don't get on orgianl song, or oldie song, in this movie....and that's one of the most orgianl and innovative things I've ever ran across.Not only are the songs great, but everything from the sets to the makeup to the costumes are all made with the smallest attition to detail....and trust me...this DVD presents it all good and well."	5.0	The BEST DVD of 2001 and a Great Movie to go With It.	2002-03-29	1	1	0

Though the first twenty minutes of the movie are a little fact-paced, it's a great movie.  The casting was excellent (I was amazed at the vocal talents of both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman), the song choice was amazing (the soundtrack has everything from Madonna to David Bowie to Fatboy Slim), the story was moving, and the scenery was beautiful.

Bazz Lurman thankfully brought it back.  Moulin Rouge is one of the most different films I have ever seen. Ewan &amp; Nicole both did great jobs, and the music blew me away.  Who thought pop music could sound opereta and antiqued.  The scenery, even though they were CG backgrounds were wonderful, and the story compelled me.  See it if you are a musical fan.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3L26MIJI1NIT3	ryu	I worked in a movie theatre when this movie came out.  When people went into the theatre, half of the people that went in came out halfway through the movie.  Initially, it was unclear as to why people would leave in the middle of a movie.  This was clarified when I actually went in to see the movie.  To be honest, my first thought of the movie was that it was quite feminine and something you'd only have to be dragged to with your girlfriend.  I went in of my own free will with some friends from the theatre I worked at.  I didn't know what to expect, but within the first 5 minutes of the movie beginning I was hooked.This movie was unlike anything I've ever seen before.  It was quite different and had amazing music with some fantastic singing from the two main characters.  I was quite surprised.  It is wonderful how the film captured the passion of the two in love, and I loved how it sort of incorporated a musical within a musical.I understood why people walked out; this is a movie that is different and something out of the norm.  I don't believe ever coming across any movie like this before.  The dancing is wonderful, the music is wonderful, the acting is wonderful.  The soundtrack is quite fantastic as well.  It's pretty interesting how they incorporated different genres of music into this movie and how it brought back a lot of hits.If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend it highly.  It is very fun to watch and something that will blow your mind.	5.0	Surprisingly Wonderful	2002-11-06	1	0	1

Her acting in this movie is as good as any Oscar winning performance I have ever seen.  I hope my husband doesn't see this, but I am so in love with Ewan McGregor now it's a little silly.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A14PEZOFSJFIC0	Sallia	It seems like everyone I talk to about this movie has a strong opinion of it. They either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it. There have been a few borderline opinions, but for the most part it's a love/hate movie.I thought I would love Moulin Rouge. It seemed like my kind of movie. I've always been a sucker for musicals, afterall. I didn't hate it, but I didn't really love it either. I'm one of the few people who falls in the in-between pile. I thought that the movie was great as far as visual effects and costumes go. The acting was also very good and the singing could have been much worse, but a note to the leads- don't quit your day job. The movie managed to be funny, happy, thought-provoking, and ultimately tragic. It was a very emotional movie and even made me get a little teary eyed at the end.The main plot in Moulin Rouge centers around the love between Satine and Christian. Their love was really a fairly typical Hollywood love affair though. They fall for each other too quickly and form an inseperable bond that was really unrealistic. While I did think their relationship was very sweet, the cynical person in me couldn't help noting how completely unrealistic it was.I can see how a lot of people would hate this movie and how others would adore it. It really depends if you let yourself get into it, I think. Only if you ignore the semi-butchering of songs you love and the underdevelopment of the characters, and just let yourself get lost in the eye-candy and craziness before you, will Moulin Rouge really take off.	4.0	Very interesting movie...	2002-04-07	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A27PFB4QOSQ1GT	salvina	I wasn't such a fan a Baz Luhrmann's other big work, Romeo + Juliet, however I loved to look at it.  This film is also wonderful to look at.  I saw it 3 times in the theater, not just because I loved the movie, but there was so much to look at that I didn't want to miss any of it.  It is the typical story of boy-meets-prostitue, boy-falls-in-love-with-prostitue, prostitue-tries-to-leave-boy, boy-and-prostitute-profess-love-for-eachother, and the quintessential tear-filled ending.  The plot is not the best part of this movie.  Yes, it's a sweet story, but the MUSIC!  They use lyrics of other (modern) songs with such artisty and humor. The performances of Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, John Leguizamo, not to mention Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh are so phenomenal!  Who knew that Ewan could sing so honestly, so believably, and beautifully?!?  Nicole was no squaker herself... she was also a wonderful surprise!  Yes, this movie is probably meant for the &quot;MTV Generation&quot;, but if you give the artistry a chance, you may find the passion for it that many of us find.  This is a modern-day musical, using modern-day techniques, but with old themes and classic Musical segues and motifs.	5.0	LOVE IT or leave it	2001-10-27	2	2	0

Above all things this story is about LOVE. &quot;sigh&quot; and it shows in every detail starting with the parting of the theatre curtains, following with the music, cinematography, cast and crew and Baz Luhrmann with a vision. Above all things this story is about LOVE.I've seen this movie for the third time and I love it more and more. I am beginning to really appreciate that Nicole Kidman did her own singing. Audrey Hepburn didn't do it in &quot;My Fair Lady,&quot; Leslie Caron didn't do it in &quot;Gigi&quot; or Natalie Wood in &quot;Westside Story.&quot;Ewan is infectious and can sell a song. Of course he could sell anything with that smile.I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I want to see if they show anything that was cut, there's a very small part of the story that seems unexplained and really doesn't effect the outcome but I have a feeling there might have been a scene that ties it together.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A32XW50ILWOXNO	Samuel McKewon	Not unlike his previous film &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,&quot; bohemian director Baz Luhrmann makes a mess out of the opening sequences of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; a bright, opera-style rethinking of Hollywood musicals.This bold and loud beginning, which takes the aspiring and fairly lousy poet Christian (Ewan McGregor) to the aforementioned Parisian gentleman's club full of tarty courtesans and one sparkling diamond among them, Satine (Nicole Kidman, who arrives dangling on a trapeze, singing &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot;) is not so promising.There's more where that came from. And less. If an old movie axiom says a good film is one that contains three great scenes and no bad ones, &quot;Moulin Rogue&quot; rewrites it: Luhrmann's opera has at least five or six great scenes, two or three stinkers and a horde of in-betweens.I liked it, a lot, as a full film experience: drama, camp, music, drudgery, scamps, tramps, poets, love, heroes, villains. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; gets messy, but in a sense it has to; only by coloring outside the lines can it reach certain peaks of human joy rarely found in a theater experience. Sure it's contrived. But it's a hell of a lot of fun.Christian's indoctrination to the Moulin Rouge is a setup, really, to help lure Satine into a turn-of-the-century musical entitled &quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot; which makes clear in its early lines that this early 20th Century tale is going to thieve from a boatload of love pop songs from today.The ringleader of this hothouse, Harold Sidler (English stalwart Jim Broadbent) has better designs for Satine, as he hopes to auction her off to a high-bidding Duke (Richard Roxborugh) in return for funding the club conversion to a grand opera theater.Unsurprisingly, a clumsy mix-up between the two men leads Christian to a private meeting with Satine (as Kidman vamps in pushups, girdles, teddies and flowing gowns in what seems a nice rebuttal to Tom Cruise's filing for divorce). And Luhrmann, who has to this point held back the dueling solos in the film, begins it in here, with McGregor's rendition of Elton John's &quot;Your Song.&quot; McGregor, who proved his pipes in &quot;Velvet Goldmine,&quot; convinced me further. His voice is high and light but broad; it goes further just as you think he's hit his vocal climax.&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; settles down a little bit after that, telling a sad tale loosely based on the myth of Orpheus, who rescued his love from the underworld only to look back upon her and watch her turn to dust. Satine, we learn, is dying from consumption, unbeknownst to all (even Satine) but a small few. Kidman's voice sounds strained at times, possibly purposely so, to show the effect of the disease.The movie stretches out and bombards us with images, colors, sounds, malarkey and love. A medley of love songs between Kidman and McGregor inside a giant elephant house is a high mark, as is duet &quot;Come What May&quot; as Satine and Christian's love song. A Spanish flamenco version of &quot;Roxanne,&quot; cross cut with another of Christian's songs and a symphony involving the Duke and Kidman is a giant feat of editing.&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; rushes through the hearts of the young and in love. It might be just too full of gusto for the older set that will find it blinding and incomprehensible in parts.

Never mind that the REAL star of the Moulin Rouge was an obese redhead (a far cry from Kidman) nicknamed ""The Glutton"", never mind that the film is chock full of ridiculous anachronism (who the hell sold these jerks the rights to ""Smells like Teen Spirit"", fer chrissakes??? they should be found and punished. Severely.), never mind that the entire film is directed to look exactly like an extended music video: Euen MacGregor is SO DREAMY WHEN HE SINGS and that is all that matters! (Ugh, excuse me for just a second: I feel ill.)A lot of people defend this move because they think it's ""romantic"". Well, if your ideal of love and romance is this gaudy, this detached from reality, this superficial, you can keep it. I'll stick with the real thing. This film is strictly for fourteen year old girls. Even a guest appearance by the Green Fairy can't cover the stink of this turd."	1.0	Total Trash: An Abuse of History	2006-09-14	42	13	29

I watch movies to be taken away from reality and movies like Magnolia that depress me and show the worst side of society are a waste of my time.  This movie made me want to be in love again and took me to places I'd never been.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were excellent and the way they took the look of Christian from an innocent writer to the devasted, broken-hearted man he became was incredible.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A4LU68MXFUEM1	Santiago Foolish	Exhausting madcap editing, pop collage sensibilities, a soundtrack that epitomizes eclectic, a love story in which everything is a breathless impression and the actors don't so much play their roles as embody them. Baz Luhrman pulls this all together in a way that I really enjoy. Call me a member of the MTV generation--I don't watch MTV, but you're welcome to. Gross historical inaccuracies and a chronological mash-up that combines show-tunes with Nirvana with Madonna serve to capture the exhilarating freedom of the bohemian revolution even as the finale evokes its disintegration. It's true to the spirit of the age, at least, and I recommend it.	5.0	Whew	2002-02-21	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2U4CL1XR2EKPV	Sarah	This movie is by far my favorite. I can't understand how someone couldn't like it...but as director Baz says &quot;The first 15 minutes is a transition into it's world. Some people make the transition. Some people don't.&quot;One of the most amazing things about this movie is the people I have met through it. It is like all the people who are obsessed with it are exactly alike. Like there is something at the core of this movie that we all want in our lives, and it speaks to us in many ways. We share a special bond because of it.For those who can make the transition into it the movie brings you into it's world. It is a world you wish you could stay in for it is so bright and wonderfull and full of song. Oh now don't you all forget the wonderfull songs! Baz is coming out with a second soundtrack in February so all us fans get the chance to rejoice! There were so many songs left off the original soundtrack it was ridiculouse...okay this is getting long...in short SEE THIS MOVIE!!

Don't moan over the fact that its a musical, if you like Elton John, Madonna and Manroe, You'll love Red windmill(moulin rouge)!!! Nicole was lovely, and sang very well followed by a succesfully played role in THE OTHERS. You can watch this spellbinding, heartbreaking film and just melt. Place your bets on Moulin Rouge being up for atleast one oscar. Kidman plays the lovely Satine, head moulin rouge dancer, Diamond collector, who is set up to marry a duke by the hilarious Harry Zidler, and mistakes him for the penniless English writer. This is all made into a play. The only bad thing about this film is it is filmed so fast that you don't get to see the gorgeaus costumes they spent so much money on.  Anyway I highly recomend this movie!!!	5.0	Top of the pops ROUGE	2002-01-03	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2AJKKMCCY5U0W	Sara Rangel	This was a beautifully created movie. Stunned again by ROMEO AND JULIET's Baz Luhrmann! A movie filled with messages of love and hate and such, Luhrmann created a masterpiece, a heartfelt story. In what was assumed to be a group of women dancing in trashy lingerie was an amazing poetic tale. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's overnite singing prodigies were astounding. I bought the soundtrack in a heartbeat. The scenes of song and dance truly told a story. The Moulin Rouge was like Heaven to some and Hell to others. Entering this French town and into the Moulin Rouge something was said about entering the underworld, how the people of the Moulin Rouge were the people of the underworld. With the humorous covers of songs the audience, including myself could not help but sing a long. I will admit, I was not dying to see this movie but I am so glad I did. With the uncanny appearances of the darker characters and the club itself, the pain of wanting to break free was seen. Although the Moulin Rouge was the center of attention in the town its inhabitants lived in a world of darkness. With hopes of arrising from her burrowed feelings Kidman is faced with her death and loss of her love. Ewan McGregor cannot understand what causes he and Kidman not to love, but he can love endlessly and like he says in the movie their is no greater feeling then to love and be loved in return. Filled with beautiful quotes and proverbs, Moulin Rouge is a must see.	4.0	I loved this movie.	2001-06-18	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2NZZQO0RVUTZB	"Sara Shoys ""sshoys"""	This is one of those movies that you'll love or hate-- i haven't heard anyone say it was &quot;so-so&quot;.  I'm in the love category-- and not just because I love Ewan McGregor, although he helped.  This movie blew me away.  I felt like I was on a roller coaster for the first 15 minutes-- it was a frenzy of color, movement, song.  I enjoyed the story and characters.  In this age of &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; movies, Moulin Rouge was a stand-out original.Perhaps what affected me the most, however, was the singing.  As a professional singer, I have a huge amount of admiration for people who can stand up and sing out when it's not necessarily their profession.  It's so rare that actors cross over and do their own singing and it would have been pretty easy for them to have Ewan and Nicole lip sync while a professional sang the actual songs.  But having them actually sing made the movie what it is.  I can't even imagine the amount of work that went into just learning the songs and practicing them until they were movie-worthy.Plus, it was like Ewan was singing just to me.  Mmmm...My friend just called to say that she rented this movie for us to watch tonight.  I can't wait!  So, despite what you may have heard, you should give the movie a chance.  It might just surprise you.	5.0	Sing to me, Ewan	2002-12-03	1	0	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AAADUSMKMEY8Q	"""satine42"""	The musical is back, and it's driving force is Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge. A film set in turn of the century France put to the music of the 20th century, such songs as &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; by Nirvana and Elton John's &quot;Your Song,&quot; takes the movie to new heights, adding more emotion to the allready heart felt story. The movie hits you with so much color and beauty you can't help but just being sucked into the world of the Moulin Rouge, as if you are experiencing this first hand.With a outstanding cast, Moulin Rouge is truely a testimant to the ideals of love. With Ewan McGregor (Christian) and Nicole Kidman (Satine), giving performances so breathtaking and real, it makes you want to sing along. A great ensomble of co-stars, John Leguizamo (Toulouse Lautrec) and Jim Broadbent (Harold Zidler), they make you just crave for more.Christian (McGregor) is a pennyless poet who comes to the Moulin Rouge to join in the Bohemian revolution. In the persuit of Truth, Beauty, Freedom and above all things, love. In a mix of comedy and tragedy the story of Christian and Satine (Kidman) is shown to you, and the ending...well...you'll have to see it for yourself.	5.0	How wonderful it is!	2001-07-22	7	6	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1XYE1JGSL6S2J	SC	"I liked Baz Luhrmann's previous works such as ""William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet"" but ""Moulin Rouge"", in my opinion, was perfect, I'd give it ten stars if I could. It was a magnificent and breathtaking film. Kidman was born to be Satine and Ewan McGregor actually CAN sing. The film was a bit too dramatic at times and the cinematography was incredible...""Moulin Rouge"" should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Baz Luhrmann should have had an Oscar nomination.Some people criticized the cinematography for being too vibrant and colorful but that was the best feature of the movie. Normally, I do not care for musicals but this is more than 'just a musical'...it has elements of drama and comedy as well. Nicole Kidman was absolutely beautiful and she did a FANTASTIC job as Satine. ""Moulin Rouge"" was a large [array] of colors, music and the craziest, most gaudy sounds of music ever! The costumes fit the movie very well.The music was great too. It was cool to hear Nirvana, ""Lady Marmalade"", ""Material Girl"" and Marilyn Monroe's calling card all at once. I also liked Kylie Minogue as The Green Fairy/Tinkerbell. Bottom line: I love this film.A+"	5.0	No Laws. No Limits. One Rule. Never Fall In Love.	2002-10-25	2	0	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2RTU0GD82KU8I	"""scotland_the_brave"""	"It is rare that I walk out of a film. It is rare that I feel so strongly about a film that it wrecks my day, and I want my two hours back. This film, admittedly, is quite stunning visually, and were it not for the infuriating music, I probably would have been neutral about it. Moulin Rouge's music is the ultimate train wreck of musical styles. I see nothing adventurous about smashing ""voulez vous couchez avec moi"" together with ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" All I see is two good songs torn out of their respective contexts and sloshed on a screen with enough glitter to cover the fact that this is a union made in Hell. Does anyone have that annoying friend who quotes song lyrics instead of speaking to you? This movie does it from one end to the other. Once is funny. Twice is trite. Three times is beating a dead horse. An entire film's worth is an aneurysm waiting to burst.Midway through the film there is a scene in which MacGregor's and Kidman's characters try to snow a potential financier by throwing all kinds of flash trash in his face in order to keep him from realizing that there was nothing behind it. It seemed a microcosm of the entire film: engineered to feature lots of shiny to keep the audience from realizing that this movie had no legs to stand on.Do I really have to give it a star at all?"	1.0	Who here likes shiny objects and flashy lights?	2002-02-19	24	14	10
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2A95EHWACMVMU	Scott	I went into the cinema expecting to be amazed with the costumes and scenery, in awe of the singing, and enthralled in the story. Basically I went into Moulin Rouge with unreachable expectations.I wasn't disappointed!The movie was unlike anything I've ever seen. The camera angles, and difficult shots are at times dizzying and overwhelming, but in the fantasy world that Baz Lurhmann has created it all works. The music is beautiful and inspiring and funny all at the same time.Nicole doesn't have the most powerful or experienced voice, but it only adds to the poignancy of her character. I found that she fit the part far better than I expected. Her rendition of &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot; was especially nice.As for Ewan, he can *really* sing! His voice was clear and powerful, and the Elephant love melody duet was probably one of my favourite sequences. That last scene (*sniffs)...Wow.I laughed (never I thought I'd enjoy Madonna's &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; quite so much!) and I cried, and I left the theatre shaking. I haven't felt that way since...I've never felt that way. I sincerly hope this film does well, because it is so unique and beautiful and touching.I heartily recommend Moulin Rouge to everyone. It's truly a movie lover's movie. It's a movie, and you never once forget it. It's flashy and loud and fake. But the fact that it just doesn't make sense is what makes it make sense. It's a movie and it's art at the same time.Stop reading already, and go see Moulin Rouge!&quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return.&quot;	5.0	Words don't describe it!	2001-06-05	74	69	5
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AAIPPIIT8SID	"""sdfergie"""	Moulin Rouge is most definitely a musical written for the MTV generation.  The editing is wild and frenetic, to the point where many of the dance scenes are nigh unwatchable and the songs are all (excepting one written specifically for the movie) reworks of very famous pop and musical songs from the '40's right on up until modern times.  The plot is about as deep as a rain puddle, and the writing goes absolutely nowhere that hundreds of writers haven't gone before.However, despite all this, the movie is quite original and incredibly fun.  Every single aspect of the production - the costumes, special effects, make-up, art direction and set design - is absolutely top notch.  The songs, while by definition are not original, are very well remastered and performed well.  And while the script is nothing special, the acting and directing raise the text to a higher level than it manages to acheive on its own right.As to the DVD specifically, this is the greatest set of extras that this reviewer has personally ever seen on a DVD.  You are able to watch the dance sequences from multiple angles, as well as in extended versions.  There is dialogue on almost every single aspect of the making of the movie, commentary from the cast, the ability to watch the movie with glimpses behind the scenes - use of blue screens, rejected scenes, and so on - while the movie is still going without having to skip to a special features menu.  And this is not even all.  Definitely a top notch production of a DVD.	4.0	Both sides are correct - it's all a matter of taste	2002-03-26	0	0	0

And if you decide to get this movie, I highly recomend the DVD edition. It is filled with huge amounts of extra footage that you may find very helpful. At the beginning of this movie I was alittle frightened, but as the movie progressed it just grew on me. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are all above exelant in this comical, tragic, wonderfully portraded musical spectactular! This is above far one of Ewan McGregor's best. His voice is extremely wonderful. And his ability to feel the charactor he is portraying is definantly seen in this movie, especially in the end. Nicole was so great in this film. And she can certainly sing as well as dance.

The chemistry between her and Ewan McGregor's Christian, a naive writer who goes to the red light district to find 'truth, beauty, freedom and above all love' against his fathers advice, is intoxicating.

(and &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; was not worthy of the Oscar).  &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a sweeping love story.  A simple and somewhat redundant plot that pulls at your heart every chance it gets.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are on fire here as the star-crossed lovers from different worlds.  Jim Broadbent is wonderful as the owner of the club.  The entire film is an over-the-top fantasy.  The visuals fly at you at amazing speeds and the intricate musical production is amazing.  Did you ever think you would hear Nirvana's &quot;Smell Like Teen Spirit&quot; woven into a musical?  I love the spin on The Police's &quot;Roxanne&quot;.  Yes, the movie seems sappy.  Yes, it's unrealistic and maybe even a bit too contrived.  But it's one of a kind, and Lurhrmann let's you know right from the first frame of picture, that this is going to be a roller coaster ride of a film.  A highly stylized romantic musical, that makes you hope that Baz Luhrmann will be making films for a long time to come.	5.0	Best Picture Of 2001	2002-11-07	1	0	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A39MQB39A7B89X	Sharon	An English writer sets out for Paris to write, and to find love.  When he arrives, he goes to a night club, and gets both.  First, he find the love of his life... Satine; the head courtesan and entertainer.  Then, from his love and experiences with her, Christian gets the story of a lifetime.  That story, is called Moulin Rouge, named after the night club where he and Satine met.I don't think a movie could be better.  Moulin Rouge would get three thumbs up... if any of us had three thumbs...  First, the cast is made up of a long list of great actors, such as Ewan McGregor (Christian), Nicole Kidman (Satine), Jim Broadbent (Zidler), Richard Roxbourgh (Duke), and so many more.  Aside from the great acting, there is also great music.  (See soundtracks 1 & 2).  There are many remakes and compilations of old songs in the movie, such as Lady Marmalade, Your Song, and Roxanne.  Other spectacular things about Moulin Rouge are the staging, the costuming, and all the work that was put into making the movie, because it shows.Some people think this movie was a bust, and that they walked out of the theatre 15 minutes after the movie started. THAT'S a problem.  The movie gets off to a slightly rough start, and if you don't give up right away, the movie picks up, and picks up really well.The romantic, musical love story, Moulin Rouge is at the top of my list and will be on yours as well.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1UC8WULT6TRM9	Shawn	The stars in this review are solely for the stunning visuals.  While I have spent time watching worst movies, I simply cannot believe the amount that went into this supremely unoriginal conceit of a film.  La Kidman oozes glamore from a bygone era, but even she could not keep me tuned into this messy reeking fop.  From the kitchy score and dated soundtrack, to the unbearable acting and staggeringly unfunny lines, this film moves me not.  The script begs the question of just why this film was made.  It could have been a soso film if the director wasn't intent on gagging the audience with the hellatious singing of all involved.  This will be a sad footnote on musicals in the 21st century.  I cannot say more than to advise watching with the volume down...way down.	2.0	Much ado about Le'Rouge	2002-01-14	7	4	3
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A38S8RD8XOXLVS	"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic"""	Moulin Rouge is a inspired film with a lot of heart and passion. In between the eye popping colorful visuals, elaborate costumes is a timeless story about artists and writers trying to maintain their artistic integrity. Even though Moulin Rouge is set in the 1900 France, this 2001 musical farce had some wonderful parallels to the creative process in modern-day Hollywood.On the surface Moulin Rouge is the story of Christian, a struggling poet from England who has never experienced love. He travels to France to join other writers and be part of the Bohemian revolution transpiring there. (Parallel to today's inexperienced New York writer who travels to Hollywood) Through a series of flukes (a guy falling through his ceiling) he finds himself working with a group of actors and writers trying to develop a play Spectacular Spectacular. One night they all head down to the Moulin Rouge, a nightclub. The actors have set up a meeting between the Christian and Satine, a beautiful actress who they want to star in their play. She's supposed to meet with a rich Duke and fall in love with him but Through a series of more misunderstandings with a handkerchief, she winds up meeting with the Christian first and tries to seduce him to get the part (A terrific statement about the casting couch) She falls in love with him, but When the Duke arrives They all have to put on a show to get his financial support for the play Spectacular Spectacular. What's funny is that they make up the premise for the play off the top of their heads. (Parallel to today's Hollywood Pitch meeting) I won't give up any more; this movie is too good to spoil.I'll just say this: people will come away with their own unique opinion about this movie. I also recommend watching it twice to get a full understanding of the movie. Moulin Rouge is multileveled; its' not just a musical. It's a farce, a comedy and a romance making commentary about the creative process. Yes, a lot of the songs are from the seventies and eighties, but it makes sense in the context of the story. These bohemian artists are making art that's ahead of its time and most people in that era would never understand it. To people in that era it's just noise, while to us these are classic songs.The acting in Moulin Rouge is Spectacular Spectacular. Ewan McGregor gives one of his best performances as the Christian. He disappears and all you see is the struggling man trying to make a statement with his writing and preserve the love he shares with Satine. Nicole Kidman steals the movie with her incredible performance as Satine. Singing dancing, you can't take your eyes off her. She has incredible chemistry with McGregor and you feel the love between them.Director Baz Luhrmann makes a one-of-a-kind cinematic masterpiece. It's truly a work of art onscreen. The elaborate sets and over-the top circus like atmosphere from his imaginative visuals create a mood of surrealism that makes everything in the movie feel like a dream. His shots have a lot of detail but are never overwhelming; it was easier for me to follow the story of Christian and Satine. He should have gotten an Oscar for best director and this film should have won for Best Picture. It's one of the most original films I've seen in years.Moulin Rouge is a Shawn James Five Star Essential video. Don't miss out on this unique movie experience!	5.0	A  Spectacular Spectacular work of art.  Destined to be a future classic!	2006-11-16	7	7	0

What more could you want from a Baz Luhrmann musical extravaganza. If you loved Strictly Ballroom, you'll love this.Apart from 2 movies (Dead Calm and Bangkok Hilton) I haven't really been a particular fan of Nicole Kidman's. That all changed after I saw Moulin Rouge. She was just brilliant. What an actress, what a voice and not at all what I expected. Excellent choices of songs for her to sing - I'll Fly Away, Sparkling Diamonds and the Elephant Medley. How could the critics say she was cold and inanimate - she simply sparkled in the movie. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part of Satine - it just wouldn't have been the same.One of my favourites scenes was when Satine and Christian were first in her room and she was trying to seduce him, and then a wee bit later when everyone was trying to persuade the Duke to invest in the play. She was such a laugh.Well done to Ewan McGregor also. I have always been a fan of his - loved him in Shallow Grave. Ewan also has a fantastic voice and you can understand why Elton John agreed to let him sing Your Song (a particular favourite of mine). He does an excellent job.The chemistry between Ewan and Nicole was brilliant to watch - they just sizzled. They also sang well together - The Elephant Medley and Come What May showed that their voices were in perfect harmony.I don't think that I will ever be able to hear Like A Virgin again without remembering Moulin Rouge. I already have the soundtrack and I can't wait to buy the video so that I can watch it all over again.	5.0	WOW - words are just not enough	2001-11-23	0	0	0

He plays the role of Christian with starry eyed innocence to a person full of torment and rage(when Satine claims to not love him). There is so many layers to his performance. His singing on the other hand is just a wonderfully added bonus. Man can he sing! For anyone of you that walked out of the theatre because you were frustrated with the &quot;LOOK&quot; of the movie... You missed the BEST performance from an actor this year.

If you are not seeing this in a city that has residents that do not appreciate this type of art you may find yourself the odd one out.  I had to endure supercilious comments from the audience, but I watched as best I could.  I recommend this movie to anyone who is able to look at the use of popular music in a movie set in the 1900's as an adventure.  The visuals are a feast for the senses and the music only adds to the enjoyment.  I have already asked amazon.com to inform me when this is released on DVD so I can watch it in the privacy of my home without any interruptions.	5.0	beau film	2001-06-04	0	0	0

Of course, the reviews of our family members is tuly mixed, so while I really loved it, my husband's parents and sister hated it.  Well, each to their own.I had no idea what I was in for and the beginning of the movie has a lot of quick change filmed angles and is very fast paced, I found that I enjoyed it more and more as I watched.  In my opinion the most amazing part of this movie is the creative use of present day pop songs in a musical.  I had to start hysterically laughing when I recognized the characters singing &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;.  It totally fit into the movie and was perfect.  In fact, all of the actors sang beautifully which was a terrific surprise.This is a modern day love story which is beautifully written, delivered, filmed and sung.  In fact, my husband and I have really fallen in love with several songs in the movie and danced the first dance at our wedding to a version of &quot;Come What May&quot; on the Moulin Rouge II Soundtrack.  Many of our guests kept asking what song that was and it really created a beautiful moment for us as husband and wife.I guarantee that if you get this movie, you will either love it or hate it.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2L9RSH5C5QSCX	S. H. Towsley	Too often musicals on film fall back to the long shot/proscenium arch style of moviemaking in order to show chorus lines of dancers doing their stuff.  Other times they have been all close-ups and no dancing or performing skill.  I assumed this movie might bore me for any number of reasons, but the opposite is true.  I've seen it several times now and several things strike me -- the musical arrangements and &quot;medleys&quot; are outstanding, the art direction is exciting, and the story, which is tragic, is nevertheless compelling.I really like this movie.  The rock music, some of it re-interpreted for the pure voices of Kidman and MacGregor, is enthralling and exciting, and that is the best part.  My favorite section is the intertwining of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; and a classic punk rock number during the chaotic dance hall establishing sequence, with &quot;We Can be Heroes&quot; a close second, but there are many others to choose from.Visually and in choreographic terms Moulin Rouge reminds me of one of Fellini's color films. But this film is absolutely much more accessible to a modern American mainstream audience.  Everything technical about this movie -- the pace of the editing, the acting, the music, the camera, the lighting -- is a treat.Complaining that this is not an original score is like saying there should be no Oscar for &quot;best screenplay based on material from another medium.&quot;  The music as re-interpreted to tell this movie's story is positively moving.  It is quite possible that people are sometimes running this DVD at home for its audio alone.  It's my favorite musical since Cabaret.	4.0	That's entertainment!	2004-02-14	2	1	1

This was definitly a lovely movie, true drama, a wild ride of imaginations all the way. The singing, the dancing, the story less so, but still nice, and the acting. Nicole Kidman did some of her best movieing, Ewan Mcgregor nost as good, but the rest of the cast was impressive. One problem, What was up with Mcgregor when he was supposingly writing the Story of Moulin Rouge, the story that we are watching? How could he have known what happened when he wasn't present? And how could he have told them to us? This significantly reduced the realism of the story, and perfection of the movie. Still, this was a tremendous film. After watching the preview I was like, no, this is going to be bad, but it actually turned out as a nice surprise.	5.0	beautiful	2001-06-12	4	1	3

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A6UGTB17P5BX8	Simon Gifford	"Set in the late 1890s this is the tale of a young poet called Christian (Ewan McGregor) who travels to Paris to make his fortune in the Moulin Rouge. He meets with the alcohol addicted Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) who introduces Christian to a seedy underground world full of drugs, sex and musical theatre. The innocent Christian is thrown into a passionate but doomed affair with Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star of the show...Based on the songs featured in this dazzling, inventive musical/romance alone, (Lady Marmalade? Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend? Smells Like Teen Spirit?) you would never know this film is set in the 19th century. But the fact the film has scant regard for reality, using some of the most famous songs of the last 50 years or so in the wrong time, really doesnt matter. Only in the hands of Baz Luhrman could such a thing like this be done, yet you never question it.The costumes, set design and especially music are all fantastic, the film has a wonderful sense of zip and energy bringing to mind the best West End show you've ever seen. Check out the scene where a whole medley of songs are sung, it seems -  (including a showstopping turn of Elton John's classic Your Song) blended seamlessly together. Ewan McGregor does have a very good voice. In fact both leads do.Theres also the clever ""story within the story"" technique - the ""penniless sitar player"" character in the play McGregor is writing being an obvious metaphor for his own character in the film, and the jealous Duke (Richard Roxburgh, who is also in love with Satine) is obviously the model for the rich, cruel ""Maharaja"" in the play.Surprisingly, the film doesnt lose anything by being told in a kind of ""flashback"" either, and having the ""outcome"" of the film being explained at the beginning as I thought it would. It adds to the romantic element of the story, in fact.Overall, a hugely enjoyable film."	4.0	Dazzling and impressive, not a typical musical	2005-06-24	5	5	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3OI761UM1W0HE	slightly mauve	"Moulin Rouge will for me always be an enigma.  A movie about a play about a love story which is metaphor for the actual plot of the film.  It's filled with over acting, underacting weird characters, strained voices, awkward and tender moments, choppy cuts, montages, grunge and pop songs reworked as musical theater numbers, and beautiful sets and costumes.  Upon seeing the opening credits (a conductor waving his baton in tandem to the 20th century Fox theme) my first thoughts were, ""hasn't that been done before?""  This sentiment would prove to be well suited to the whole of the film.  Every few moments a scene, plot point, device, or musical number seemed to come up that I could swear I had already seen or heard in some other place.  And even when Nirvana lyrics were sung by a chorus line of tuxedo wearing men, while Christina Aguilara played in the background, and scenes of cartoon like decadence filled the screen, I couldn't help but be swept away by the pure and simple disparity of it all.  As far as performances go the only one worth really caring about is Kidman's.  While her lines may seem ham handed and the situations contrived, she delivers a stellar performance which manages to elevate this film to a level where it can be watched by people who are not consistently tripping on acid."	3.0	What a film	2007-12-21	4	4	0

Part video, part british bedroom romp, part Hollywood musical and all surreal! This is the kind of movie that if done wrong would have been the biggest bomb in history. Thankfully Baz Luhrmann hits all the right notes. (excuse the bad pun)  Using the theater device of a story within a story, this movie takes us through the adventure of a wacky cast putting on a production while discovering their desires of Freedom, Beauty, Truth and above all, Love. At times your eyes dont know where to look, thanks to the lavish sets and costumes. It's a sensory overload. Just when you become ajusted to the wild displays, the cast bowls you over with their amazing singing and acting. The plot is simple enough, so I wont spoil it. Suffice to say its a job well done. The funny parts make you laugh out loud, the dramatic parts will make you gasp out loud ( in the theater I was in ) and the singing... well you just may go straight from the theater to the music store for the soundtrack. As I said at the beginning, hang on to your seat and enjoy the ride.	5.0	Moulin Rouge	2001-06-07	5	5	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3SQZCA0JFB5CV	S Martin	Comparable to watching a Vegas show on acidI primarily wanted to see Moulin Rouge to head Nicole Kidman sing. I should have just contented myself with the fact people say she can sing, and not wasted an evening viewing this movie. I can't say it's the worst movie I've ever seen, but it comes pretty close.The plot of the movie is fairly simple, something that had the potential to expand into a good movie, but it fell short. The characters were poorly developed; in fact Christian (Ewan McGregor) was the only character with any background at all.  His desire to live the Bohemian life and write prompted him to head to Paris, even though the voice of his Father haunted him at first, but mysteriously stops, even though he fails at his goal of becoming a famous writer.Satine starts out as a whiny courtesan/dancehall girl who wants to become an actress and will do whatever it takes, and through the course of the movie develops into a woman who's willing to sacrifice it all to be with the man she loves, even though she's striken with a deadly disease she doesn't know about. Kidman does make a beautiful Satine though, she looks like a china doll, and she can actually sing, maybe not like Mariah Carey or Aretha Franklin, but she has the voice of a singer in a dancehall.There's very little background on Zidler, only that he owns the Moulin rouge and keeps care of Satine.  There's even less background on the Duke, how he came to be an invester in Spectacular, Spectacular is unknown, all you ever really find out is that he has an interest in Satine.The film could be compared to watching a Vegas show on acid, the camera takes strange twists and turns, vibrates randomly, and then swirls the colours together even more randomly.  The contemporary music doesn't add to the movie except in a few rare spots(I nearly walked out when Zidler and the Duke sang Like a Virgin).	2.0	Comparable to watching a Vegas show on acid	2001-06-15	5	1	4
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A30UAJL56PQKUG	S. McQuillan	Moulin Rouge is an unique, ambitious and heart-wrenching movie.  Baz Luhrmann is a creative genius and a visionary who definitely deserved an Oscar nomination for Best Director in 2001. I personally feel that it's a crime that the movie did not win the Oscar! This movie has all the elements of a classic: great music, excellent performances, breathtaking sets and a beautiful love story.  Ewan McGregor's performance is truly amazing.  Not only is his singing fabulous, but he plays Christian with total abandonment and passion.  He moves me and also deserved an Oscar nod. Nicole Kidman's performance is gutsy and heartfelt.The DVD of the movie comes with many extras that definitely make it worth the money.  First off, make sure that you have a surround sound system.  It's is the only way to really appreciate the music.  The musical documentary portion is very interesting and gives an idea of the work that went into selecting the songs for the movie.  I also recommend watching the movie with the commentary from Baz Luhrmann and Catherine Martin.  It provides great insight into the movie making process.If you saw the movie in the theater and didn't like it, I recommend trying the DVD.

It was beauty, breathtaking, exciting, and amazing. But somewhere after the 7 minute love medly between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman I started to doubt the quality of this supposed FILM...and decided that it was just a movie. There's a difference between FILM and a MOVIE. I hold Ewan McGregor in high respects (even though he is doing the new Star Wars installments) and Nicole Kidman I could take or leave.I'm not saying this is a bad film, because its not...Baz's idea to take songs like Paul McCartney's ""Silly Love Songs"" and Elton John's ""Your Song"" and put them in a movie set in the late 1890's is silly and sounds original and new yet doesn't work for me...much like ""A Knights Tale"" (oy vey!). Baz as a director is amazing and I was highly amazed at how he did this. I was going to say how much I loved the cinematography, but I was slow to realize...this was all done with computer...which is fine...but I guess its the indpendent film lover in me that bashes this movie which loses its originality within the first half hour. The whole idea of this movie is taking unoriginal ideas and putting them all into one movie and adding crazy effects to make them look original, sorry, its not working for me.  The dialogue is all overused dialogue I've heard and I've heard the music before too...so basically all that's left is the acting talent...Ewan was bright eyed and beautiful in this film and had a youthful dazzle to him.  ....By the end I was weary of it as a whole and I had seen it all before. I will give kudos to Mr. Luhrmann to trying to take a familar love story (poor poet falls for beautiful prostitute and she in return falls for him) and putting a spin to it. Though, I can't fully like this movie because for one it never finds itself, I never get a full definition of the characters...I think I know they love each other, but thats where it becomes hard because even though they sing ""I love You"" and that ""There is no greater thing than to love and be loved"", but I just didn't feel moved or anything. I go to see a movie to have it move me, to change my prespective...and thats why I went to this movie. But I left disapointed, weary and tired of the formulaty. But in the end, without the singing and the crazy computerated cinematography what is this movie? Just your run of the mill love story...love is great, and I believe in it...but I believe in a love that is more than this......, you'll never find any enlightments to love in a romance movie, because love is much more than that.

The plot is vapid to non-existent, and if what you are looking for is a two hour excursion into hell, this is it.  The performances are truly outstanding, the set design and cinematography is stunning, and Jim Broadbent turns in his usual staggering great performance.  But hearing Ewan McGregor butcher Elton John and Rogers and Hammerstein, and dwarves running around with lisps over and over again is more than the average person can take.  Taken separately, many of the elements of this film are an achievement - colorful to be sure -and very, very red.  But it failed to hook, primarily because it failed to make me care or hold my attention.  If this is the best Hollywood can do with the musical as an art form, then I hope it stays dead a little while longer.  I'll take Cabaret or the Sound of Music over this any day.  If you want to see Nicole Kidman in a great performance, see the Others.  I bought this after seeing the Golden Globe nominations.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  If there were a sequel to Dante's Inferno, the director of Moulin Rouge would be chained to a rock for all eternity and made to listen Ewan McGregor sing &quot;Your Song&quot; non-stop for all eternity ...with Kidman just out of reach.	2.0	A dissenting view	2001-12-26	1	0	1

Get it over with quick so we can get on with our lives.This film was awful. I endured about 30 minutes of it. If there was an actual story, I was unable to detect it. The first 10 minutes were so confusing, I was wondering what we were actually watching....My wife didn't even like it. I was actually done with it at about 20 minutes. I endured an additional 10 minutes out of respect for her. She finally looked at me and said she was glad we didn't see it at the theatre.

I've watched the hell out of the DVD, and vowed to pick up the title as soon as it hit Blu-Ray.  Well, I did just that, and have been seriously disappointed by the release.  The video claims to have been remastered and ""Approved by Baz Lurman"", but half of this disc seems to have been mastered out of focus.  The contrast is muddier, the colors aren't quite as vibrant as they should be, there is quite a bit of noise in many of the dark/slow-motion shots.  Half the time, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor feel blurry and out of focus, even though the surrounding scenery might be sharp.  Did Baz approve this transfer by checking it on an iPod?  I've also seen this film in the theater several times and I don't remember the film prints having this many issues.Unless you are a huuuuge fan, do yourself a favor and stick with the special edition DVD of this movie."	3.0	My favorite movie on a disappointing Blu-Ray	2010-11-07	11	9	2

The CGs are not being used effectively at all, one might as well use hand drawings and they would look better. The story was dull and repeating. Sometimes it just looked ridiculous to me.

And, like the ride, you get off either feeling exhilerated or sick to your stomach.I saw the movie at the last-chance dollar cinema, since I hadn't been able to convince myself to pay full price.  In case you haven't been, dollar cinema audiences are generally less reserved than their first-run theater counterparts, so you get a much clearer idea of how the they're receiving the show.  This one was a real mixed bag:  There were several people singing along with the songs for the first half-hour or so, until either self-consciousness set in or their neighbors shushed them.  On the flip side, a group of about 6 guys sitting near us got up and walked out 3/4 of the way through, never to return.As for our little group, we all enjoyed it.  Some parts (especially near the beginning) were somewhat queasiness-inducing, but those didn't last long.  After that, things settled into a very straight-forward boy-meets-girl (etc.) plot, and there wasn't quite as much jumble.  It could have become boring at that point, but there were so many cool camera effects, unusual points of view, unexpected uses of songs/lyrics, etc., that I hardly had time to think, &quot;What a silly movie!&quot; until after it was over.Nicole Kidman (who is in EVERYTHING lately, it seems) was gorgeous, I had to admit -- and can she SING!  (That proves it - life really ISN'T fair.)  Ewan McGregor, whom I've never seen before as the lovestruck hero, was PERFECT.  His winning smile and wide-eyed expession would've melted a heart of stone.  I found his voice somewhat less pleasing than Nicole's, but since he was playing the innocent boy from the country, this suited the storyline.  What else?  Well, I wouldn't have minded paying full-price to see this, had I known I would enjoy it so much.  Everyone who stayed for the end was chatting and smiling, and those few who walked out were, no doubt, somewhere else sulking.  I would say if you like musicals in general, and splashy, colorful display, you'll probably love this movie.  Otherwise, rent another movie as backup?	4.0	Like the teacup ride at the carnival.	2001-08-22	3	2	1

To my surprise, I loved it.  Sure, it has its boring moments, but don't ALL films have those?  I found it very entertaining and thought altogether was a masterpiece.This movie is a play in a play.  Christian (Ewan McGregor), a writer, falls in love with Satine (Nicole Kidman).  Although Satine HAS to fall in love with and marry The Duke, she's caught between her career and true love.The music is fantastic.  The acting was good; Nicole and Ewan light up the screen.  Kidman is hilarious, so is the rest of the cast.  In the movie, there'd be random scenes where Satine (Kidman) would faint.  One scene, Satine faints in the middle of her performance.  She falls from where she was sitting and lands in the crowd.  Of course, the audience thinks it's all part of the act, so the show goes on (Satine is sent to be fixed up until next scene).Moulin Rouge is an extraordinary performance, both movie and play in play.

Nicole Kidman has never looked more beautiful, Ewan never more adorable. My pre-reservations about the score were quelled from the opening, and Kidman's rendition of 'One Day I'll fly away' is breathtaking.Note to detractors, below:There is a plot.Of COURSE there is, the film is stuffed with plot. What did you think it was about?It is not meant to be serious.It is a melodrama not a serious attempt at storytelling. It is full of overblown artifice, unrealistic comic strip creations (I sometimes think I'm watching a different film to other people)Why shouldn't the leads be Oscar nominated?They have shown themselves to be the most versatile perfomers of the year. And even though Lurrhman's frantic pace and manic editing sometimes disables their ability to truly 'act' there is enough here to propell all the actors to even dizzier heights.	5.0	Like an Explosion in a Glitter Factory.	2001-10-05	0	0	0

However I'm one of those who disagree with the great ratings it received... There's nothing wrong with the acting... just the plot is so ridiculous and I felt silly watching it. It tries to be fairy-tale-like in an adult sort of way... to me these 2 just don't mix very well... I'd prefer either the one genre or the other. The songs were great remakes of old-time classics from musicals and bands, which I really enjoyed being a music lover myself. I think if not for the songs, I would have walked out of the movie 30 minutes into the show. Perhaps its true what people say : you either love this or hate this.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1B4HO1GEJ7CPJ	"Stacy Hardin ""honest reviewer"""	"Even though I am a BIG fan of Ewan McGregor, I was scared to rent this movie. I guess because I didn't know what to expect. I knew or actually heard of how different this movie was. However, I did rent this movie not too long ago and Ewan McGregor steals the movie.The movie centers around this young wanna-be writer, Christian (McGregor) and he recounts his life at the Moulin Rouge and his love for Satine (Nicole Kidman). My favorite part of the movie is the ""Elephant Love Medley"". I played that scene over and over again, because I love McGregor's singing. Don't worry, I'm not forgetting Nicole Kidman...I was surprised by her voice. Even Kidman is good in this movie, this movie is ALL Ewan McGregor. He is SO GOOD in this movie, it's hard to describe. From the beginning to the end, he shows such emotion. I have never seen him act THIS good in a movie before. This is one of his finest performances I have ever seen. Kidman's performance is also so very strong. They have such good chemistry...I hope to see them together in a movie again. McGregor was stripped of a Golden Globe he was so rightly nominated for and Kidman definitely earned her Golden Globe win!!!!The thing about this movie is that it does start off crazy in the first 15-20 minutes, but then it goes to an unexpected storyline that I didn't expect. It is something different, but don't be afraid of it. Yes, it's a musical, but if it wasn't for the music, the movie wouldn't really make sense if there wasn't the singing.Even though I've gloated about McGregor's performance, the whole CAST is great!!!!!The story itself is very good and I had no idea what the story was and I certainly didn't expect the ending, there are some slow, boring scenes like the ""Like a Virgin"" music number. I could've done without that.All in all, it's a good movie with AWESOME performances by Nicole Kidman and especially by Ewan McGregor."	4.0	All McGregor	2002-05-26	4	1	3
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1NG0SME54D1Q8	S. Tang	"Moulin Rouge is a cinematic masterpiece. Vibrant and spectacular, Baz Luhrman has created a fanciful world with the talents of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. The story is based on the Greek Orphean myth. But if you're looking to buy the DVD you probably already know what the story is all about. A general review of the DVD is what I'm trying to write about here.The video is so clear and crisp that it finally does justice to Luhrman's imagination. Sound quality is just a little lacking, but overall, you get every note and lyric presented in this movie. You won't be amazed, but you certainly won't be disappointed. I only say it's lacking because as this is a musical, based on music and soung, I expected them to play extremely close attention to sound presentation. And I also hoped that some of the vocal drowning would be fixed, but it wasn't really. I guess it's my fault for being disappointed since I had high expectations.The director's commentary didn't really talk about the movie as it was playing as much as I wish it would have. They mostly went off on tangents about their writing process which you also heard them talk about again on the 2nd disc. I was hoping for insight into certain scenes and shots.The extra features are amazing. Being able to cut the tango sequence with the multi-angle view while it was streaming on the screen was amazing and seeing the extended version of the dances was great. Watching the backstage interaction between Kidman and McGregor was amazing and also made you realize how much effort they had really put into this and how normal these two people really are. The dance rehearsals really let you see how the dances developed, however I found there were some dances that Kidman had practiced in rehearsals but never made it to the screen and also weren't included in the extras. Kind of disappointed that they showed us glimpses and didn't let us have the rest. There is no doubt that Kidman certainly has a natural grace.I wish they would've put more interview time with the stars into the 2nd disc, and they included some stuff twice, but it was still great to get this glimpse of their thoughts. I loved that they included recording studio clips while the actors were having fun playing around and rehearsing.I was grateful they did edit out the version of ""Come What May"" they originally had, and very glad they changed the ""Dance across the sky/Your Song"" sequence because they detracted greatly to the feeling that the final sequences had. But it's still fun to see what they were originally planning and then going ""Thank God they didn't use that.""Having the Coup d'Etat dance sequence just reminded me that there was no Coup d'Etat on either of the two soundtracks, but that's for another review. This was in fact one of my favorite pieces of the movie because of the depth of emotion starting on Satine's first warbling breathy ""Never knew..."" till the very end when the curtains finally fall. However, it was still great to see this extended version.The Music videos were pretty good, but I expected them to include Elephant Love Medley and an extended Come What May video... Instead they stuck a video of the Come What May Josh Abrams Remix which essentially ruins the track considering it's supposed to be slow and watching the speed up the tape too is just a little wierd because they are the same shots but at a different speed. Watching the ""Musical Journey"" interview makes you entirely grateful that they finally choose the splattering of 10 or so songs for the Medley than the 2 they had originally.I have to say, I loved the photo gallery in the Marketing section of the 2nd disc. There are some candid shots, but most are from the actual shots and the quality and clarity of these pictures are amazing. The ""Little Red Book"" is also a very good guide and I highly recommend ""flipping"" through that.All in all this is an extremely loaded DVD even if it is a little disappointing at some points such as commentary as to why things were cut and as to a few more extras. Anyways, I would recommend this like no other DVD. There haven't been a lot of directors who've utilized the DVD, and I love that Luhrman knows his market enough to admit that the DVD is an amazing tool that he very well plans to take advantage of. And to his credit, he does take advantage of it. The setup for the menus are awesome. Watch the movie, love it, then buy the DVD for all the goodies as well as quality. No doubt this is a great buy.One final comment I have on this movie, is that no matter how many times I've seen it (no doubt somewhere in the thousands by now), it is a true testament to Baz Luhrman's directing that I always expect the movie to end differently. I know how the end will happen, but every single time I get towards the end of the movie I forget this is a tragedy and find myself caught up in the happiness. And that in itself is a sign of an excellently directed film."	5.0	Fall in love with love again	2002-03-10	2	0	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2IG2FG7L85RMU	Stanley H. Nemeth	There's much talk that Luhrmann has created something new with this mishmash, the postmodern musical.  Actually, he's a latecomer if such were his intention.  The brilliant under-appreciated &quot;Pennies From Heaven,&quot; with Bernadette Peters and Steve Martin, either of whom can act and sing circles around Kidman and McGregor, is the film that actually deserves the ravesthis tiresome eyesore is now unjustly receiving.

I say that when I just have a...VHS recording for HBO ( i am kinda[thrifty]). But then I rented the DVD, and what a difference.The DVD has a much better level of clarity, and sound performence. Plus if you want to activate it, a special feature will give you some behind the scenes info about the movieOn the first DVD, it shows the actualy movie itself, plus a couple of added features. Also it has some interviews which are pretty cool.The second DVD, has all sorts of nick nacks for any Moulin Rouge lover. Also hidden deep withen the DVD is a scene where Nicole starts laughing her head off when Ewan is singing 'Your Song'. It took me over an hour to find it, but don't let that mis-lead you. It is very easy to navigate around in the DVD and see the extra features it offers. I also highly enjoyed the un-cut dance seqences.All in all, this DVD is well worth the money, and these are the words from the mouth of a very [thrifty]person.

Afterwards a friend of mine called me and asked how it was.  I replied: &quot;Well, it was great, awesome, spectacular&quot;, &quot;that good ?&quot; he replied.  &quot;No&quot; I answered, &quot;it was better, it's a masterpiece.&quot;Yes, I didn't know anything about the film and was a little bit confused in the beginning by the cutting, zooming and movements that made me a bit dizzy.  Not a very good start I thought, but then it really started.This simple story about the poor man, rich man and the beautiful girl, turned into a visual feast for eye and ear.I am a middle age man and tough as I am, then I could not stop tears running on several occations during the film while enjoying the music and the performance of Ewan and Nicole. Their duet made of 1-2 lines from popular lovesongs was great, but the Roxanne scene blew my mind.  One of the best I've ever seen.There are weak points in this movie, but the overall effect is so overwhelming that it left me and others sitting awhile after the film ended to savour the feeling we got during the film.  There are many years since I have got this great feeling while watching a movie.  The goosebumps the amazement and the whole emotion was just terrific.This movie is now on my top 10 and will most likely be there for a very long time.	5.0	Spectacular Experience	2001-11-08	4	3	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1FR1N3QLXRSGU	Stella	There are however a few requirements you probably have to meet if you're going to enjoy this film.1.  You have to know Baz Luhrman's film style, it's very unique.  You also have to be able to get his humor.2.  You have to love musicals obviously.  And musicals that are a stretch, seeing how this one is like no other I've ever seen.3.  You also must realise this film got a love/hate reaction, either you're going to be completely obsessed or you're going to think it's terrible.Now that that is over, I'll say why I liked it.  A lot of reviews here seem to say that the two main actors (Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor) have no chemistry and cannot sing.  I guess this is a matter of opinion, becuase I think they are gorgeous together and they both have beautiful voices.  I saw this four times in the theatres, and every time something very dramatic happened, or there was a very important part, the audience reacted heavily.  This was the only movie I've ever seen in theatres that caused the audience to have a very visible reaction.  And as I left each time I noticed over half the people were crying.  People you don't usually see crying too, like college guys and stuff.One thing that has also been heavily criticized about Moulin Rouge is the fast paced filming style.  Baz Luhrman used a unique panning in and out and just moving really fast style to create an atmosphere.  By making what's onscreen appear fantastical, he keeps the audience aware that they're watching a movie, yet also lets them feel as if they're a part of it.If you already knew you liked the movie, I definetely suggest the DVD.  There is so much extra stuff on the second disk, and also on the first there are two different audio commentaries.  I usually don't like those commentaries, but at least one is really fun because it lets you go behind the scenes of only certain scenes to see how they were made.  The HBO Making Of special is also included, which is great.If you're still wondering, &quot;This story is about love.&quot;  I think it's one of the greatest love stories ever told, and anyone with an open mind would like it.	5.0	I Still Maintain It Is the Best Movie Ever	2001-12-31	1	1	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AKYKK6XBIJV1	Stephanie	"In fact, I weep for every artist whose songs were picked out for ""Moulin Rouge"" (not Madonna, though, but that's a different review). Adding in popular songs in a movie that's supposed to take place in the early 1900's would normally be kitschy at best, but every song in here is taken a bit too literally in the film and robs what little depth and emotion this film could have had. To add insult to injury, Ewan McGregor speaks rather than sings, Nicole Kidman disguses her un-talent by singing in an airy, breathy voice reminiscient of Mandy Moore, and GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY WHY DID THEY USE A NIRVANA SONG?!As to not rant forever on the music, I'll go to other topics: the story was so utterly predictable that my grandmother left the room, even though there was at least an hour left of the film. The actors don't fit the characters, so it's very difficult to feel any sympathy for them. The cinematography is motion-sickness inducing at best and MTV-style at worst. On a positive note, the sets are visual eye candy, but pretty looks do not a good movie make. Have I mentioned that I sobbed with remorse when I heard them remake ""Smells Like Teen Spirit""?I don't want to go on. It fills me with pain just thinking about this movie. But if you like movies like ""Titanic"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"", by all means see this movie.

This to me spells great success. It is not just a few 1's, but hundreds - so there is a formula here for a very unique movie that you will either love or hate statistically speaking.So here is your guideline. If you like things like American Sweetheart, Narnia, or Harry Potter (the Hollywood Like Hits) and your taste stops there - don't order this.This is a movie goers movie. This is a musical, a movie with song and a unique approach to cinema. If you or your friends are serious photographers or into video you will love the quality of this.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AL277B4AQCWBG	Steven Reynolds	"Luhrmann and co-writer Pearce evidently think that having their hero walk around repeatedly proclaiming that ""this is a story about love"" somehow makes it so. It may well be the case that ""the greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love, and to be loved in return,"" but rather than be told so ad nauseum, I'd much rather be told a story which demonstrates it. On that count, the Christian/Satine love story fails. It is escalated so rapidly and explored so superficially that it's hardly even moving, let alone a compelling argument for love as the meaning of life. But such is the nature of musicals where plot is subservient to spectacle. And on that count, ""Moulin Rouge!"" succeeds marvelously. As always with Luhrmann, music and production design are the primary attractions. And this looks and sounds utterly spectacular. Kidman and McGregor shine, and seeing Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh perform ""Like A Virgin"" is worth the purchase price alone. (Roxburgh entirely steals the show. We can now forgive him for ""M:I-2"".) But don't be fooled by the taglines. This is not a story about love. It's not really a ""story"" about anything. It's a lecture on the history of romantic musicals and a two-hour commercial for a couple of CDs. But for all that, it's highly original and will still have you grinning from ear to ear."	3.0	This is NOT a story about love...	2002-06-01	1	1	0

The plot and the storyline are very similar to Disney movies. Even the singing reminds of animation films like The Lion King. This is a kid's movie. The only part I liked is almost at the ending where Satine and the Duke have to 'consummate' their relationship. For the rest it's pretty bland and unsurprising and that counts for photography, story and setting.

During the early moments of the film I kept thinking surely it will break out of this intolerable and convoluted visionary and musical mess and give us intelligent film-making.  It never did.  How on earth this film has garnered any of the awards or nominations it has is beyond me.  To attempt to juxtapose turn of the century Paris with Elton John and Madonna lyrics as well as references to tunes such as The Beatles' ""All You Need Is Love"" and the Sweet's ""Love is Like Oxygen"" is utterly ridiculous.

If you have seen La Traviata or Camille you've got it (including the spitting blood and the throwing of money to the courtesan in public, not to forget the recriminating old father). The formal originality consists on mixing a Ken Russell inflated musical with unrestrained bits from a  Franco Zefirelli production. In the added material Nicole Kidman enlightens us about the moving force of this enterprise: love can be expressed in music better than in any other genre.  The only advantage over La Traviata is that we are spared listening to 'Di Provenza il mare il sol', an aria I hate more than any other. Thanks to that I can honestly say that yes, I liked the music.	2.0	Give Verdi a chance, he is not that bad.	2002-06-25	11	4	7

But I kept watching, and something happened to change my mind.Ewan McGregor sang to me. Yes, to me. OK, to Nicole Kidman, but whatever, I felt like he was really singing just for me.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1TL34XG2HNMQ6	Sursubbu	This was, in my opinion, another of those unreasonably hyped films and this holds especially for Indian audiences who are already used to and saturated with the entire concept of a song-n-dance extravaganza taking the place of narrative.The visuals are impressive, no doubt; the huge sets are awash in eye-candy and the camera's numerous swoops and pans take your breath away...for the first 10 minutes. After this you realize that the film is moving in a kind of loop with the same cycle of shots trying to claim your attention for its entire duration. There's just so much you can appreciate of popular songs being woven (in frequently mangled form) to fit into the groove of this musical. The film misses the tremendous cinematic value of contrast between the reality of Parisian street-life and the glitzy illusions of its music halls. The performances are pretty much of the cardboard n' candy-floss variety trademarked by ye typical Hollywood studio romance flick. Nicole Kidman is irritatingly out-of-place and Ewan MacGregor appears to have completely discarded his Trainspotting roots. Supporting characters are uniformly ridiculous, with John Leguziamo asking to be strangled with barbed wire for his clumsy portrayal of Toulouse Lauterec, the sensitive artist whose illustrations were in no small way responsible for the fame of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. Jim Broadbent as the freaked out owner Lidler is good in an over-the-top way for some of the scenes.Even 'William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet', never in itself a great film scores higher on my list than this self-indulgent tripe.

The movie is frantic and jittery in its pacing and is filled with self-indulgent rapid-fire camera movements and editing which does NOT ENHANCE the story in anyway.  Rather it DETRACTS from it.It gives the viewer a throbbing headache rather than touching one's heart or stimulating the viewer's intellect.Nicole Kidman is lovely and she has a beautiful singing voice.  But Ewan McGregor, handsome as he is, has a loud, colorless voice which lacks any nuance or subtletly.On the plus side, the sets and costumes are quite spectacular, but the movie as a whole is trying too hard to ""redefine"" the musical so that ""Moulin Rouge"" loses coherence or poignancy.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A25USOC3A9938V	Susan	Wow, where to begin.  This film hits every octave of emotion, from true joy to numbing sadness.  If you can go to the theater with an open mind, just sit there and let the story and visuals envelope you, you will not be dissapointed.  The ONLY thing I regret is not being able to stay at the theater to see it again. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have a tangible chemistry, the screen (and speakers) resound with it every time they're on screen together.I can see where some people will not like this movie.  Those who are &quot;set&quot; in their ways and trained to like simple, predictable fluff.  Again I emphasize, have an open mind.  The first 1/2 hour will leave you *literally* breathless, your mind will be processing quicker than you're used to.  Just enjoy it, you will soon get used to the rythym of the movie, and the payoff is worth it.I took my mother to the show, who at 68 is *extremely* set in her ways.  I prepared her adequately (open mind, let the movie wash over you etc.) and she *loved* it.  She is not an emotional woman, but needed a kleenex to get through the show.Go, enjoy it.

I usually get embarrassed for the characters who break into song, but with this movie I was amazed. The acting of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor (what a hottie!) was superb. I was amazed a what good voices they had. I was mesmerized from the very beginning. The songs are just beautiful.Listening to Ewan McGregor's woefull voice tell the tale of his beloved Satine was heartbreaking. I was sucked into the vortex of Moulin Rouge. I cannot understand how anyone who watched this movie did not fall in love with it and the characters. Granted the main character is a courtesan, but who cares? She falls in love with the penniless writer and true love prevails, she understands what 'true love'is. From the very beginning we know that their love was doomed, but we still rooted for them, for love is 'like oxygen' and we wanted them to be happy.All in all, this was an amazing movie. I would suggest that you watch it before believing the hype. Amazing movie, I loved it!!	5.0	Unbelievable!	2004-01-15	6	4	2

Moulin Rouge was set in 1900, when they were singing Madonna classics like &quot;Material Girl&quot; and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; personaly I thought they should of had more appropriate songs for the era. I liked the movie in general- although that guy with the red hair freaked me out a little- And they needed to get more into the duke, It didnt make perfect sense how he got there. There where a lot of many little storys evolving around the love story of Christian,a writer from London, and Satine, a dancer at the moulin Rouge.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2CZR46KVZLWDT	Suzie	Anyone who's seen Nicole Kidman in a movie will say two things about her: She's beautiful and fairly talented. Anyone who's seen Nicole Kidman in two or more movies will say two things about her: She's beautiful and very talented. Because Kidman never plays the same character twice, each one is distinct as she proves yet again in this movie. In Moulin Rouge Kidman puts on a raunchy and sometimes delightfully ridiculous performance as Satine, a dancer in France's Moulin Rouge.The story revolves around a young, artistic and (if you're asking me) incredibly handsome writer, Christian (Ewan McGregor), who is hired to write the script for the play that will turn the infamous whorehouse into a theatre.  Well, he - being obsessed with Bohemian ideals truth, beauty, freedom and love - falls madly in love with Satine, the featured showgirl.But Satine, doing what she does for a living, is paid to make any man believe she is in love with him, but must genuinely fall in love with no one. Yet, after some persuading she does fall for the adorable writer and they commence to have a secret relationship. Which, must be kept even more secret after a rich duke who is paying for the expenses of the play says he won't give them the money they are relying on if Satine is not legally bound to him. However, it soon becomes clear that both men can lust as they might but Satine's fate will take a different turn, one that doesn't involve either of them.The story, which starts off light, silly and very fictional soon becomes romantic, enthralling and ultimately tragic. The setting is perfect, representing freedom and opportunity for some characters but entrapment and desperation for others. Not only are the characters terrifically well done but the cast is magical. Along side Kidman and McGregor, John Leguizamo and Jim Broadbent star as the lisping Toulouse and owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler.And let's not forget the music! Although not original, favorites like Material Girl and Your Song are given magnificent new sounds in this new-age musical. Not to mention both of the stars can sing pretty well.In my opinion this is simply one of the best movies of 2001, but I'm sadly aware that it is rather strange and hard for those with more traditional taste to enjoy. But I still feel that anyone who doesn't give Moulin Rouge a chance is missing out on a whimsical, diverse, yet heartbreaking and romantic movie experience.	5.0	Bohemian ethics rolled up into a messy but delightful movie!	2002-08-12	1	1	0

Toulouse, along with 3 other Bohemians, take Christian to the Moulin Rouge, a nightclub where the beautiful Satine (Nichole Kidman) is the star of the show.  Christian falls in love immediately, and soon wins her love in return.  All happiness and fluffiness, right?  But there is a problem.  A man known only as The Duke (he doesn't really have a name...), played by Richard Roxburgh, wants Satine all to himself.  He signs a contract with Harold Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge.  The contract states that the Duke with provide money for Spectacular Spectacular (a Bohemian stage production written by none other than Christian) if Zidler will insure that Satine will be bound to him and him alone (the Duke, not Zidler).  Zidler agrees, but Satine refuses to stop seeing Christian.  Madness, musical numbers, and a death insues!  I'm not saying who dies.  But it's sad.  I cried.  But it was a GREAT movie!!!

The movie's opening with the curtain going up on the stage, the unconventional lighting and camera angles, the amazingly intelligent use of familiar music in a new way, the costumes, choreography, and filming all add up to a really innovative and exciting movie. I think this should win an Oscar as best picture of the year, but Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings will probably win, and while they are excellent movies, they do not have the freshness and sauciness this one does.	5.0	Should win an Oscar, but probably won't	2002-01-01	2	0	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A35NJJQGGE1VDK	"""taibak"""	Yup, it's true.  You will either love Moulin Rouge, or hate it.  The movie is so utterly loaded with excesses that there is no room left for middle ground on the matter.  The movie is simple spectacle for spectacle's shape.The plot is simple.  Penniless author falls in love with a  beautiful and unattainable artist but has to keep her away from the incredibly rich, powerful, and square duke.  In other words, it's nothing Shakespeare In Love didn't do better and you'll probably be able to guess how the story ends within 20 minutes.  That's not the point, however, as Baz Luhrmann uses the story as a backdrop and send you spinning into a fantasy world.  The sets and costumes are spectacular but the music is so outrageous, so over-the-top that your reaction to it will make or break the whole movie.  The first big dance number is a medley of two original songs, 'Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend,' 'Material Girl,' and 'Smells Like Teen Spirit.'  Somehow, it works.I will admit, this movie is not for everybody.  I liked it - which is why I'm giving it four stars instead of three - better than A Beautiful Mind or The Fellowship Of The Ring.  Others may find the movie's excesses too much to stand.  The beginning is a bit absurd (my reaction to the first five minutes was one of skepticism and disdain).  The directing style is hyperactive, but Lurhmann is nowhere near as jerky as he was with William Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet, a movie that was literally making me motion sick watching it.  Still, the acting is solid, particularly Nicole Kidman, John Leguizamo, and Jim Broadbent.  Broadbent's performance as Harold Zidler alone is worth watching the movie.  Even Ewen McGregor, whose voice doesn't quite stand up to Kidman's or Broadbent's manages to hang in there musically and make up the difference with his acting.That said, if you willing to accept Moulin Rouge for the simple, absurd, over-the-top spectacle that it is, watch it and you will not be disappointed.  If not, you're better off looking elsewhere.	4.0	Sheer excess.	2002-04-09	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ACCEC9E3BDSPR	Tallulah	I think the main strength of this movie is definitely its scenery and costumes.  Both were amazingly atmospheric and beautiful, and unashamedly echoed the emotions acted out around them.  Kidman and McGregor were both really good as the two leads - I found them believable and they created strong chemistry between them.  I also enjoyed the music although I wish 'Lady Marmalade' had been performed straight through, not just as backing for Zidler.  Some of the love songs don't seem amazing at first but they grow on you, and the Hindi Sad Diamonds play, El Tango de Roxanne, and The Show Must Go On were three songs that sent shivers down my spine - the camera angles were excellent (although I agree that sometimes it all gets a bit carried away and I would have appreciated a little less madness from the filming.)The weak point of the film is probably the characters, who are all pretty one-dimensional.  Normally this would constitute a major flaw, but in this I don't think it matters so much because what's important is the music and the atmosphere.  The actors are all doing their best with a rather weak script and that's good enough.I think this film would not be good if you were in a very cynical mood, if you hate musicals and/or high-camp glamour, or if you hate Nicole Kidman.  Otherwise, I strongly recommend it - even if you don't like it, it's different enough from most movies to make you think a little (even if it is only 'that's a perfect example of how not to make a movie'. ^_^) It's an original and exciting film and I don't regret seeing it for a moment!	4.0	Glitz and Glamour	2002-07-03	1	1	0

After so many other theatrical works which have explicitly dealt with the AIDS crisis along comes this movie to speak about a forgotten subject but only through allusion.  Barely disguising a dazzling gay iconography and in the wonderful tradition of the musical, the writers tell us that the story of love is still worth telling even in an era of loves lost. I'd offer this film one more star if its message had been more meaningfully heard.	4.0	Post-AIDS Camp	2002-01-21	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3MZTBF1RG1LJH	"""tani_the_beatles_fan"""	This is just one of those rare and beautiful movies that come along and capture your heart.The story is simple enough: A young poet, (who's character comes from the Orpheian myth) played by Ewan McGregor, travells to Paris and falls in love with a dying courtesan. Through the movie their love is tested by many obstacles, but pulls through. It also sends out a very beautiful message, &quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return.&quot;Actors: All of the actors are Spectacular!! But really I think Ewan McGregor was the best, he is just so believable as Christian (the poet) he really grabds hold of your heart and, you just he's just for lack of a better word, amazing.  Nicole Kidman on the other hand, is also fantastic in this.......her best scene is probably sceme 26(on dvd) which is just so.....powerful. But their are also many other wonderful actors in this film &quot; John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxburgh, and all the extras!So if you haven't already watch this movie, and don't be afraid to add it to your dvd collection as it is brilliant and heart warming and never seems to loose it's effect.	5.0	A truly beautiful film!	2004-04-22	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ADBFIP0VZR38C	Tanya M. Ball	In my humble opinion, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; should have won an Oscar last year. It single-handedly revived musicals. It definitely opened the door for &quot;Chicago&quot; to win this year.I was a little skeptical about seeing this movie in the beginning. I'm not a huge Nicole Kidman fan, and all my customers and employees at the video store were all giving me very negative reviews. However, my aunt said she wanted to see it, so I rented it for us one weekend.  It has fast become one of my top ten movies.For those of you that have seen &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet,&quot; you're already aquainted with Baz Luhrmann's directing style. Flamboyant, no-hold's barred, breath-taking are only a couple of words I can use to describe it.I've always liked Ewan McGregor. The boy can sing, as he's shown in &quot;Velvet Goldmine.&quot; This movie is Ewan at his best. Jim Broadbent definitely deserved the Oscar as Harold Ziedler. John Leguizamo steals the movie as the dwarf, Tuloose. Finally, Nicole Kidman gives the performance of a lifetime as Satine.This movie is not JUST a musical. It has comedy, drama, action/adventure, suspense, EVERYTHING! So, if you've been on the fence, go ahead and make the jump over to the &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;	5.0	Spectacular, Spectacular....	2003-04-08	0	0	0

I love musicals (especially Les Miserables), but it was advertized somewhat poorly and I thought it looked almost hokey.  Not to mention how sick I was of hearing Lady Marmalade every 3 seconds on the radio.  I thought the movie seemed not worth my time, and that I wouldn't like it anyway.How incredibly wrong I was.This more is so unique and has so much character, it blows you away.  Whether you enjoy musicals or not, this movie is amazing for so many different reasons - the acting, the cast, the sets, the costumes...and of course, the songs!  It's nothing that you could expect or imagine, because it's in a genre all its own.  It fits so many different categories, but not just one - a drama, a comedy, a musicial, a farce - a love story.  It's a movie that definitely reaches people on all levels, as long as its given a chance.This is one film that is definitey not a waste of your time.  It will leave you breathless and drunk with emotion.  If only there were more than 5 stars...	5.0	A Beautiful, Funny, Wonderful Story About a Boy	2002-07-11	1	1	0

The effects travel beyond realistic measures to the point where you're not quite sure what you're watching at first, but it's perfect.  Moulin Rouge is the type of movie where you find yourself suddenly laughing through tears.  It's got excellent comedy, passion, music, drama, and everything.  The very day after seeing it, I ran to purchase the soundtrack.  The movie also passes along a great message, which I won't mention as to not ruin it for anyone.

Everything was so artistic: the music, the costumes, the set design. There was even quite a bit of comedy.&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is the story of a young writer named Christian who goes to France to seek his fortune. One day, he stumbles upon a group of Bohemians who believe in &quot;Beauty, Freedom, Truth, and, above all things Love&quot;. They take him to the Moulin Rouge (French for &quot;Red Windmill&quot;) where he meets Satine, the star of the show. He falls in love with her instantly. But, unfortunately, so does &quot;The Duke&quot;. Harold Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge, signs a contract binding Satine to the Duke only. Thus begins a very beautiful and tragic love story. The only bad part is that you have to stomach the really stupid first fifteen minutes to experience this colorful and entrancing film. Bohemians like me will love this movie instantly.	5.0	Bohemian Treat	2002-04-20	1	0	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A7M428U2TROIR	T. Choong	&quot;Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all, Love&quot;The movie uses these four words as the slogan that is voiced throughout by its various characters, and to a certain extent, the film carries out a fulfillment of these principles. The spoofing of these principles come however with a constant repetition of them by the minor characters like John Legizamo's dwarf.Elements of self-reflexivity govern the film to make us aware of its very nature as kitsch, and the film is not even ashamed of its nature as kitsch (or should I say &quot;Baz Luhrmann&quot; instead of &quot;the film&quot;?). This is highlighted many times through the repetition of motifs and lyrics from songs already well-known in American popular culture, which would include Madonna's &quot;Material Girl&quot;, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, Gloria Estefan's &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot;, Marilyn Monroe's &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend&quot;, and Whitney Houston's &quot;I will always love you&quot;.The self-conscious attempt to stage and produce a play(or drama) within the film itself, called &quot;The Spectacular Spectacular&quot;, adds to the elements of interest for an audience. Originally intending it to be staged in the backdrop of Switzerland, the characters change their mind and take a ludicrous turn for the worst, when they decide to change the setting of &quot;The Spectacular Spectacular&quot; to exotic India. The story of an evil and jealous old maharajah wanting to possess a beautiful woman for himself, and the hatred he bears towards a zither player in love with the woman, mirrors the love between Ewan McGregor's Christian and Nicole Kidman's Satine, which is foiled by the jealous affections of the Duke. Not to mention the least, the sequences of Hindi song and dance are pivotal to illustrating the darker passions unfolding between these characters.Next to the adaptation of Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, this is undoubtedly the reel event event of the year. Soap melodrama lovers can look forward to bringing their tissues to the theater, while lovers of pop tunes and Broadway alike will find a reason to flock to it.	4.0	The Reel/ Real Event of the Year	2001-12-13	1	0	1

I thought that was just one of the many amazing tricks that this movie actually pulled off brilliantly.  It left me stunned.  The singing in the movie is amazing, with Nichole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's real voices, which blended together perfectly.  I really respected Kidman and McGregor for using their real voices, which I thought were surprisingly 'spectacular spectacular'.  And on top of that their acting really pulled this movie off.  Kidman was hilarious in the misunderstanding of the poetry scene, and McGregor was a perfect shy, young boy in the scene right before the elephant medley.  All in all, this movie amazed me.  It's the kind you wish you saw more often with all the components; great acting, amazing cinematography, gorgeous sets, intricate costumes, and a romantic but suspenseful plot.	5.0	Nothing Better	2002-01-02	0	0	0
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A8B9RKEMZXXBI	tfiennesfan	Although the subjects and material broached in this highly unusual musical have been glossed over many times in various different forms of the media, there is something electrifying about Moulin Rouge.  At times it does feel like a long music video, but then we should remember that music videos are, like all versions of film, an art form--granted they are a terribly abused art, but they are art nonetheless.  The fact that a musical and a music video should mesh is not a ridiculous notion, nor is it without its uses.I am no big fan of Ewan McGregor or Nicole Kidman, but I have to give them their dues--they did some amazing vocal work, and some great acting.  It doesn't take an infatuated and sappily loyal McGregor fan to see that there is real talent here, and it is actual instead of potential.  And even if the romantic aspect of the musical doesn't interest you, it is possible to shift your attention to the conflicts of the individual characters.There has been criticism about this being a period piece, but if you get hung up on the little details and completely forget that, as many movies do, the story and (in this case) the characters take precedence over perfect history narration, then this isn't the movie for you.  Even if the film was historically correct, we can't rightly say that it is accurate to history that people randomly burst into song, can we?As for the music of Moulin Rouge, well, what can I say?  There are some awesome songs, taking old material and bringing to it a new spin with either an interesting melody, or unusual vocals.Another aspect of the musical that has been critiqued, and rather too harshly, is the cutting/editing.  During the entire movie and the songs especially, the shots change constantly and sometimes switch between many different scenes and characters many times in a few seconds... Again, Moulin Rouge is a musical, an art form in its own right, and instead of simply relying on the material in front of the camera to emphasize the situation, the cutting and pacing of the film is sped up and very erratic, lending energy to the musical.  I think this is rather effective, especially in the scene where Nicole Kidman's character is about to sell herself to the Duke.  The cutting allows the audience to see all the characters (albeit for very short moments at a time) reacting most every moment, with brilliant use of color to draw out emotion, and lighting to leave shadows of danger and mystery.This musical is, overall, not the most unique in its material or plot of love and love lost, but certainly is in its direction and artistic approach.  The music, at times incredibly interesting and pretty or fun to listen to, is at the least entertaining.  Brava to the actors and actresses, main and supporting, for doing what they are supposed to be doing--acting.  If you want something less conventional, and riveting from the beginning, I recommend Moulin Rouge.	4.0	Innovative in its own right	2006-11-13	2	2	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3KKPVZ2EQQLAB	The archduke	Baz Luhrman has proven himself to be a visionary director, and he proves this once again, and most emphatically with &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. This film is visually stunning from beginning to end, his flashy sets and high-speed cuts really keeping the eye busy, never letting us rest for the entire length of the movie. His surreal views of turn-of-the-century Paris are breathtaking, and many of the oddball quirks he throws into the film are wildly entertaining.&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is about the famous Parisian nightclub/brothel, where the CanCan was made famous. A young writer comes to Paris looking to be a part of the Bohemian revolution, and finds himself writing a play for the Moulin Rouge, and in the meantime, falling for their most famous hooker, played incredibly by Nicole Kidman. The plit of the film kind of has a &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; feel, as the play he is writing is reenacting the events taking place between him and his love, and vice versa.The acting here is amazing, led by Kidman and Ewan McGregor. They both prove they can act, and surprisingly, sing. I was amazed at how good both of them were on the songs, and neither of them shied away from the difficult notes and tones, always plunging headlong into the song with great success. The entire secondary cast is also top-notch, especially the actor who plays The Duke.As far as the music goes, this film truly breathed new life into the musical genre. For those who are into comparisons, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a better movie than &quot;Chicago&quot;, and the music easily destroys the competition. The songs here are very modern, ranging from Madonna to U2, the Beatles to Elton John, and Whitney Houston to Nirvana. Yes, that's right, Nirvana. When I first heard that &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; would be a part of a musical, I was appaled, but upon seeing the film, I was impressed at how sonic it sounded being sung by hundreds of actors at the same time. All of the songs here are great, and integral to the plot. There are none you need to fast forward through, as with most musicals. The high point is &quot;Your Song&quot;, the Elton John classic, sung by Ewan McGregor.This is a great movie, even for those who have never been fans of musicals. Aside from the singing and dancing, this is a beautiful love story about two star-crossed lovers in the most romantic city in the world. The costumes, set design, casting, cinematography, writing, acting and directing are all great in this movie, and its success has ressurected a style of movie that was long considered dead.	5.0	Rebirth of the Musical	2004-02-14	0	0	0

Well, it takes a lot for me to really like a movie, and Moulin Rouge is one of my favorite movies ever.  Even if you didn't like the movie, you can't deny Luhrman's courage as a director.  McGregor and Kidman were fantastic, in roles that were not exactly easy performances.  I thought hands down the best part of the movie was the Roxanne &quot;segment&quot;.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3AUECYM0M0YSX	The Man in the Hathaway Shirt	"I'm not trying to be contrarian here, really.  I'm trying to figure out why post-modern critics and movie-goers get all lathered up over anachronisms in movies.  What is so impressive about porting Madonna and Patti LaBelle songs into 1900 Paris?  Or about putting modern-day manners and slang into old contexts?  Why does this inspire such creative awe with this generation?  Monty Python & company did it, for comic effect, 35 years ago, and no one thought it was ""genius.""  Amusing, perhaps, and that's what this film is, for 15 minutes, until it becomes obvious there's no plot and no point.  What storytelling or dramatic skill does this technique show that otherwise could not have been shown?  Why do it other than auteur-driven gimmick?""Ah, but you're contradicting yourself,"" you say (or you would if you've read all my other reviews here in Amazon).  ""You heaped praise on Terry Gilliam's Brazil and talked about its anachronistic nature.  Gotcha!""  Well, no.  Brazil wasn't really about mixing time periods, despite what most of the reviews said.  They didn't catch the title card in the beginning that said ""Somewhere in the 20th Century.""  The film wasn't about the future--a future with science fiction technology next to 1940s typewriters and fedoras--but rather an alternate *present*, a warning of how things could have turned out if history had been just a little bit different.  This is not, strictly speaking, a case of anachronism, but even if it were, it makes a point, it has a function.I don't see a function of it in this film, directed by ultra-hipster Baz Luhrmann, who, judging from the supplemental materials, seems to have an ego the size of Paris itself.  Nor do I see a point in shooting everything in a hyper-kinetic style that has more in common with Looney Tunes cartoons than anything French, anything Moulon Rougish, anything musical.  ""It stands the musical on its head,"" the reviews shriek.  Yeah, it does.  One can stand *anything* on its head; the question is, does doing the headstand reveal anything different than with both feet planted on the ground?  If in this case it does, someone tell me *what* in the ""comments"" section below this review.  Be specific, please: nothing like ""It's making the musical modern but you old fuddy-duddies can't stand that!""  That's a rant, not a revelation.The movie is shot in a helter-skelter style with an editor who to me appeared to be all-thumbs. (How was the choreography? someone asked me.  I don't know; there was too much cross-cutting to see it.) Composition of shots was...well, there wasn't any; the director seemed to just line the room with cameras, ""spray"" the scene and bounce from angle to angle randomly in the editing process.  Maybe he thinks this is the kewel new way to make movies, but I'll take the choreography of a Fosse and the cinematography of a Rotunno any day.  The story itself is pedestrian, perhaps intentionally, since kitch seems to be in style among filmmakers right now, but it wears thin.  We have boy meets girl (but girl is *forbidden to love*!), boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, girl dies (dramatically, of course).  No, that last is not a spoiler that ruins it for you.  They tell you she is dying in the first 20 minutes, and in case you don't hear it through all the noise, they show her having a coughing fit that would alarm the Marlboro Man, and when someone puts a handkerchief to her mouth, we see spatters of blood.  (One of Roger Ebert's movie rules is anytime a character bleeds from the mouth they will die.)  This screenplay has the subtlety of the 5:15 from Manhattan running over a squirrel.Kidman is good, but it's more good casting that good acting, as she's shown before she excels at aloof and unreachable characters with tragedy attached.  MacGregor does the best he can, but he's a caricature more than a character (which is the intention, by the way).  I know we're all supposed to be impressed it's a musical inside a play inside a movie.  Big whoop.  Nice art direction and I dug the idea of nestling it all into a period-style presentation, but that wasn't enough.I doubt this review will convince those who are always thirsting for the ""brave"" and ""new"" and ""cutting edge,"" so I probably just wore the coating off my keyboard for no good reason.  Brave and new is fine, if it has some kind of point to it other than to draw attention to itself.  Just because something is different, that doesn't make it ""genius.""  It just makes it...different."	2.0	Baz baby, you're not all that	2008-02-20	8	7	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A23RQOODUIBCNY	themarsman	I was initially skeptical about seeing this movie.  It looked like just another love story...and it was.  The story had the herione in distress (played by Nicole Kidman), the meagerly-existing hero (played by Ewan McGregor), the father-figure who tries to control the heroine from behind the scenes (played by Jim Broadbent) and, of course, the manipulative bad guy (played brilliantly by Richard Roxburgh).  But the above quartet was not alone.  This movie features the quirkiest &quot;back-up&quot; cast of characters I think I've ever seen in a movie, headed up by John Leguizamo's nutty gnome Toulouse.  Beyond the great cast of characters was a spectacular, if usually gaudy, set...as well as a rather...inventive...list of musical numbers.  Moulin Rouge takes place at the turn of the 20th century.  The musical numbers are anachronistic.  That is, the majority, if not all, of them are from late 20th century performers like Elton John and Madonna.  Initially, I didn't care for the fusing of late 20th century music with early 20th century motif...but it grew on me and by the second half of the movie I was thoroughly enjoy it.  The only problem I had with the movie was that it seemed to entirely focus on &quot;Inside the Moulin Rouge&quot;.  I realize that this was the performers' life, but surely they went out to buy groceries or something, right?  Overall, despite some initial hesitiation, Moulin Rouge won me over...the movie is definitely worth seeing.	5.0	A By-The-Numbers Love Story...Sort Of	2004-01-29	6	4	2
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3IP0R4JOD4R5G	the masked reviewer	"Some movies are just too wild, too rambunctious, too drunk on movieness to be comprehended in a normal theatrical run, and Baz Luhrmann's MOULIN ROUGE is one of the latest models.It's impossible to imagine what the ticket-buying viewers of this attention-deficit meta-musical were expecting, but chances are it wasn't what they got: an in-your-face, anachronistic debauch so absurdly designed and festooned with frippery it makes any Madonna road show look like a game of three-card monte. Even if you've seen and survived Luhrmann's ROMEO + JULIET, you've never seen anything like this before. It's the Hollywood equivalent of a shaken-up case of canned champagne.In the theater, the film came at you like a volley of cannonballs, and even in the back row you could get whiplash. At home, Luhrmann's wacky pyrotechnics will be more easily digested -- the DVD format might be the only way to make the world safe for this movie.Ostensibly set at the turn of the century in Paris, when the titular nightclub was gaining eminence, MOULIN ROUGE revolves around the doomed romance of consumptive star Nicole Kidman and penniless writer Ewan McGregor (and revolve it does, at 100 rpm). Luhrmann edited the movie in a full-blown montage fever, mixing in contemporary songs (by Elton John, Nirvana, Madonna, et al) and jumbling fantasy and reality so that, in the end, it isn't a movie so much as a speed-rock daydream of tragic love, musical impertinence and smiling moons.Make sure to rewind often, because there'll be tons of stuff you'll miss (including a TITINIC dig); at the very least you'll never be able to listen to ""Your Song"" the same way again."	5.0	The DVD format might be the only way to make the world safe for this movie.	2008-04-20	3	3	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1CYRTQ04LYI55	"therosen ""therosen"""	"Color, speed, drama and delightfully anachronistic music fill this surprisingly enjoyable movie set in turn of the century (1899-1900) Paris.  A boy falls for a courtesan, they decide to run away, but it's a love fated to go bad.  The story has been told many times before.  I fully expected to dislike the movie, but something about the pace, the unexpected musical twists, and the scenery made this a great movie.  The medleys (perhaps Montage is a better word?) combine classic musicals, R&B;, cartoon music and grunge - and they pull it off successfully. Perhaps the only regret is seeing it on DVD, as the movie experience must have been grand.That said, I saw it with my dad, and his only reaction was, ""This is very strange"""	5.0	A great surprise!	2007-01-23	3	3	0

What he misunderstands is that most musicals have a very simple storyline, and that people enjoy them more for their music, dance, and overall style. By trimming these parts, he's left us with a bland, obvious story about forbidden love. Ho hum. Thankfully, the DVD has most of the musical sequences restored as part of the special features.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"""Moulin Rouge""... ""Moulin Rouge""... ""Moulin Rouge""... I had the distinct pleasure to watch the new film by Baz Luhrmann on Friday night. Why I am I just posting my opinion now? Why didn't I rush to my computer to start spreading the word? I simply couldn't even comprehend writing a single word about the film. I had to think about it. Think about it a lot.For me, a film fanatic, ""Moulin Rouge"" is a glorious experience. It reaffirms my love for movies. It came just in time. After watching two highly anticipated, but really dreadful films (I'm talking about you `The Mummy Returns' and `A Knight's Tale'), after finding out that my two favorite theaters started charging more for fewer bargain matinees, after learning that online movie tickets now carried a surcharge, after watching crap like `Joe Dirt' and `Freddie Got Fingered' clog the multiplexes, ""Moulin Rouge"" came just in time. ""Moulin Rouge"" is a film made by a filmmaker at the height of their talents. It is Luhrmann's `Godfather'.I frequently talk about the fact that we have to suspend a certain amount of disbelief for any film to work. ""Moulin Rouge"" requires you to give yourself over completely. If you do, you will be richly rewarded. If not, you will hate the film.Christian (Ewan McGregor), a nave British writer, arrives in Paris, 1899. Too idealistic, he wants to live in the shadow of the Moulin Rouge, the famed nightclub, and become a famous writer. Quickly, he meets Henri Toulouse- Lautrec (John Leguizamo). Toulouse- Lautrec is trying to put together a play called `Spectacular! Spectacular!' He has two problems. He needs a writer. He needs a backer. He realizes that Christian is the writer after he provides them with the words to a song they are trying to unravel. Christian belts out `The Hills Are Alive... With The Sound of Music'. The backer is Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the owner of the Moulin Rouge. To get to Zidler, they try to impress the famous, Satine (Nicole Kidman).From the first frames of the film, Luhrmann thrusts us into a world of make believe. His Paris, 1899, is a place of bright lights, bright ruffles and clouds to dance on. It is remarkable how quickly and completely the director accomplishes this. The film is about a play and never leaves the theater setting or sensibility that it depicts. The first few images are really remarkable and set the tone. Collections of moving daguerreotype pop-up storybook images take us back into time and immerse us in the story.Luhrmann first made his mark with a remarkable Australian import called `Strictly Ballroom'. In ""Moulin Rouge"", Luhrmann resurrects the live-action studio musical. This film is a love letter to the Astaire- Rodgers classics, the Gene Kelly classics, and the musicals of the 60s. Unlike many musicals, the songs actually help to advance the story. Also, Luhrmann made the choice to use 20th Century music throughout. Yes, it evokes laughter, but it comes at the recognition of the songs and how well they fit into the story at the time. He is also smart to use snippets of songs, to make his point, and then move on. Occasionally, he uses the entire song, creating show-stopping numbers that I will remember for a long time. I am still constantly thinking about Zidler and the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh) singing `Like A Virgin' and the use of `Roxanne' at the beginning of the third act. How often can you say that you think about particular pieces of a film for days afterward?Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are both surprising. McGregor is a very good singer. Both actors did their own singing, but McGregor is the real standout of the tow. His voice has a lot of range and uses his songs to build a real chemistry with Kidman. I can honestly say that I have found Kidman to be a very overrated actress. In ""Moulin Rouge"", she is terrific. Funny, sexy, dramatic, it works. The story is an old one, done hundreds of times, but these performers make the story fresh by providing a much needed chemistry. Christian seduces Satine by singing her a love song, a collection of love song titles, in one of the most erotic sequences I have ever seen.Jim Broadbent is simply terrific. His performance made me think of Joel Grey's in `Cabaret'. This is only because their characters serve the same function in the nightclub setting. Zidler is the owner of the Moulin Rouge, but also a ham and therefore the Master of Ceremonies and frequent star. His character is very complex and he makes it thrilling to watch Zidler switch back and forth, using knowledge as a weapon.My only complaint about the film? John Leguizamo's Toulouse- Lautrec becomes a member of the buffoon Greek Chorus meant to provide comic relief. His part is not integrated very well and he is never shown painting. Instead, he stumbles around trying to put on a play? He also talks with a very strange accent.""Moulin Rouge"" is an outstanding film, filled with an exhausting energy. The camera never stops moving, careening over frilly, brightly ruffled costumes and intricately designed sets and stages.It is also the type of film that must be viewed of the big screen. There is so much texture, so much color, no television can do it justice.An amazing film."	5.0	Great! Fantastic! Outstanding!	2005-04-12	5	4	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1GUNWMLGT7VT4	Tibet Kanagawa	Original, vibrant, zesty, ... timeless, extraordinary are but a few adjectives to describe Baz Lurhman's film.Moulin Rouge transcends anykind of movie experience you may have had before.  Right from the start, it throws you into a warped, psychedelic reality of Go-Go Girls and Edwardian tweed.  It zips along at a pace that makes MTV feel like slow motion.  On top of all the surreal goings on, there is a beautifully constructed (albeit simple) story on which to hang the clothes.  Throw in some very original takes on modern music classics, and you have the time of your life.On top of all this perfection, are the charimatic performances of the lead actors: Kidman radiates and McGregor charms.  The show is stolen by a wonderfully seedy Jim Broadbent.  See one of the finest movies of 2001!	5.0	Moulin Rouge	2002-01-27	1	1	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A36I2PY2O683F8	Timothy L. Constant	"Although it is evident that the filmmakers were making a valiant attempt to resurrect an extinct animal; film musical comedy, they have failed miserably.  Perhaps it is an impossible task.  Moulin Rouge is an indulgent mess, with a few wonderful sequences and performances (most notably by Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent, both of whom are quite good) Personally I am mystified by the film's appeal.  Kidman and Leguizamo are both way over the top, the story is much too simplistic and the dance sequences are unfocused and dull.  I would very much like Luhrmann to take a look at an earlier film of his ""Strictly Ballroom"" and take a lesson from it.  Maybe going back to his roots (as they say) might help him create something worthwhile.Although not as dreadful as his Romeo and Juliet, Moulin Rouge is still a failure.  I can not recommend it to any but the least discriminating viewer."	2.0	Trying to resurrect the dinosaur	2002-01-30	4	1	3

I really couldn't figure out why until I realized I'd almost been duped by all the shiny objects, which were desperately trying to cover up the extrordinarily dull script. After a bit over an hour it seemed that the director, and the film, simply ran out of steam, and were just trying to wrap up the film in such a way as to not call attention to the lousy story. The actual direction, once the really big numbers are over, is pretty awful. Every single time something ""heavy"" or dramatic happens he resorts to a blurred slo-mo of the characters in question. After seeing this same trick 5 times I was officially sick of the movie. Blim, blam, zim, zam, at the end of it all it's smoke and mirrors.As a spectacle it works fine, but then ""COPS"" is a spectacle too. As a film it's severly dull."	2.0	Rent before buying, definitely	2002-01-04	2	1	1

The movie grossed about $60 million at the box office and won 4 Oscars.Its truly a feast for the eyes, each minute saturated with color and music.  So yeah, Nicole Kidman isnt the best singer in the world, but she sings with feeling, like an actress should.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1NLX2NT3A5Z1U	TOL	It is a rare event to watch a movie that has virtually no flaws. In other words, at no point do you, as the viewer, say, &quot;I would have done that differently&quot; or &quot;That just doesn't make sense&quot;. I think, to qualify as perfect, a movie has to have a simple plot, a lot of visual stimulation, a great soundtrack, and clean editing. It has to be the kind of movie that you don't need to think a lot about, you just need to enjoy it.I have seen only one movie that, in my opinion, fits this bill. It is Moulin Rouge. Don't buy it for the action, or for the plot, or even for the acting.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A160IOAWSDDQBQ	Tom	Far be it from me to criticize other's taste in film, my own is pretty eclectic.  But I really can't figure out some of these reviews.  Moulin Rouge is sheer entertainment - exhuberent and lovely. When I saw it in a crowded (sold out)theatre, the audience was so appreciative that they applauded between numbers and gave the film a seven-minute standing ovation at the end.Film is a collaborative art, not only in its production but in its performance.  What one sees in the film is, ultimately, what one brings to the film. My only explanation for the few bad reviews, therefore, is that perhaps the video incarnation of Moulin Rouge is somehow a less rich experience than the theatrical performance.  Seeing movies in solitude is a great way to study them (left brain activity) but a very poor way to enjoy them (right brain activity).  Film critics see movies in solitude - usually in special screenings arranged before the premiere.  Film lovers, though, enjoy the electricity and excitement of a shared experience.  Love is only love when it is shared.I have never been particularly fond of Nicole Kidman, but she shines here, reminding me of a young, beautiful and talented Ann Margaret.  When Kidman moved from &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; into &quot;Material Girl&quot; the audience became ecstatic, laughing and applauding the goofy incongruity which, nevertheless, worked.  Ewan McGregor's voice quavers a bit on the high notes, but I think it might be intentional -- after all, those notes mark a high point of emotion. The rest of his singing voice is fine and full.  Both of them are incredibly beautiful to look at and there is palpable chemistry between them.Yes, the story is thin -- but we're talking &quot;fairy tale&quot; here, not Tolstoy - it IS light, airy, weightless, almost. So was Shakespeare's &quot;Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;. It is giddy and sometimes silly, but so is being in love.With the exception of those musicals that moved from stage to screen, few movie musicals have completely original scores.  One of the greatest movie musicals, Singing in the Rain, is COMPLETELY a rehash of older material.  When talkies began and musicals became popular, Warner Brothers bought a huge catalogue of standards and simply recycled them through most of their movie musicals from the early 30's through the late 50's.  Yes, it is a bit disconcerting to hear Elton John and the Beatles (not to mention Madonna) in a turn-of-the-century narrative, but after the initial shock, the fun is infectuous.This is a movie ABOUT love . . . and it is a movie TO love.  I love it, and I hope you will too.  Valentine's Day is coming up, and Moulin Rouge has my vote for the best &quot;Valentine's Day&quot; choice this year. As I mentioned, Love is only Love when it is shared -- so be sure to share the experience of watching this film with someone you love.	5.0	So Beautiful, you'll be tempted to lick the TV screen.	2002-01-09	2	1	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ALN0TTRTLHA4E	"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick"""	Baz Luhrman's previous two films, Romeo and Juliet and Simply Ballroom had a lot going for them. They had considerable energy and visual style. Obviously with Romeo and Juliet he also had a good writer.This film however is dreadful. It is little more than an endless video clip. Instead of dialogue a large amount of the communication between the characters is by chanting out pop songs.The plot is one about selfish people. A young play writer whose ambition it is to produce low rent theatrical productions, a actress who wants to move from dance routines to become a serious actress and is willing to sleep with anyone to do it and a theatrical producer who is willing to prostitute around his staff to get funds for an upgrade of his theatre. The moral quality of the characters is enough to make one vomit and the basis of the audiences identification with them is through their physical attractivness.In reality of course with a film like this it is probably ridiculous to talk about the deficiencies of the plot. The heroine for instance suffers from mysterious movie disease. That is a disease that has no real effect on health until the last scene of the film. Prior to that her problem seems to not limit her ability to lead an extremely active life.It is the sort of film which either grabs you because the imagery is beautifull, the pace is frantic and the sets and dancing is okay.However in his previous films although not epic works of the mind seemed to have just a little bit more to grab you. Simply ballroom had less egotistical characters, Romeo and Juliet was based on a piece of our heritage which we all know. This is like watching a Comic Strip without the interlectual depth.I thought Pearl Harbour was the worst film this year till I saw this.	1.0	Absolute Dog	2002-01-05	18	10	8
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1CZKNW6IJFKSG	Tonja	"You will either love or hate this movie.  (just read the reviews) Personally, I think it's absolutely stunning.  The music, the costumes and sets...even the camera angles.  The story is relativly simple -It doesn't need to be complex...it's about true love- but nothing else about the movie is.  The acting and singing are perfect (who knew Nicole Kidman could sing?) and it's funny!  The first time I saw this it made me want to laugh, cry and cheer hysterically all at once.  Everything in this movie is about seeing things from a new angle, thinking outside of the box.  The music is all recycled, it's true, but it's presented in a brand new way, trust me, you've never heard ""diamonds are a girls best friend"" like this before.  Move over Marilyn.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ADXJBL8H8VWVT	Tony	I seldom buy a DVD, as there aren't many movies I could sit down to watch more than once, but this movie is a buy. And this is from a guy who likes action movies.I have two critiques: one, the casting. Kidman doesn't have that face you can feel sympathy for. And Ewan? Well, they should've left him back in one of those Jedi movies. Second, the producer has to get over his Madonna fixation: there were  too many Madonna songs, and some of them just didn't fit.Fortunately, the rest of the movie surpasses. Choreography was top notch; and if you ever wondered what Burl Ives would look like singing &quot;Like a Virgin,&quot; then you've come to the right place.If you enjoyed the classic Jose Ferrer version, you'll enjoy this one too.	4.0	Brought life back to the genre	2002-06-07	1	0	1

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A35ZK3M8L9JUPX	"TREND700 ""TREND700"""	It's Paris in 1899. Christian, a young English poet, comes to Paris to pursue a penniless career as a writer. However, he soon meets a group of Bohemians who tell him that he should write a musical show for them to be performed at the Moulin Rouge, the most famous underworld night club in Paris. The night they arrive at the Moulin Rouge, Christian meets Satine, the club's star and a beautiful courtesan. He falls head-over-heels in love with her and though it takes a bit of convincing, she falls for him as well. Meanwhile, the club's owner, Harold Zidler, invests in a wealthy Duke to help pay for the club, however, the Duke will only pay if Satine is his. This crazy love triangle twists and turns. And little does Satine know that she has a deadly secret that could end everything. Visually it is superb, an indulgent feast for the eyes with every breathtaking, artistic scene. Everything about it is over the top, every scene more stunning than the next, and as it continues, your heart becomes more and more intertwined in the love story. It pushes against the confines of convention and leaves you breathless. A stunning, visual feast.	5.0	Moulin Rouge! (Widescreen Edition)	2010-02-11	1	1	0

I give total thumbs up to the fantastic soundtrack as well-- nothing like it.By the movie's end I was so touched that I have been able to think of nothing else but the ache of a love like that.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A5CWLQF6QO3CN	"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B..."	As most people know, Moulin Rouge is one of the most famous nightclubs in Paris. However, under the magical touch of Buz Luhrmann, Moulin Rouge became the place of life, death and romance of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.The story was a very simple one - a famous dancer fell in love with a newly arrived poet who, under accidental circumstances became a writer for the new production at Moulin Rouge. Of course, life would not be that easy when the romance was intertwined with a wealthy and powerful Duke, who would never set his eyes on anybody else except the spectacular Satine (Nicole Kidman).Despite the simplicity of the story, Buz was able to turn it into series of jaw dropping musical scenes and spectacular cinematography. The whole picture was truly Luhrmann - abundant adoption of speedy zooming in and out, dark but sharply contrasting colours, repeated landscape under different tones, and super creative screening and editing methods. In Moulin Rouge, you would see a never been so attractive and gorgeous Nicole Kidman, an always handsome and love seeking Ewan McGregor, and a whole lot of superb supporting casts. Buz had made the right choice to cast Nicole Kidman as Satine, the everlasting song bird of Moulin Rouge. She got all the charisma of this character and the essence just flowed out naturally. Ewan McGregor had proved that he is an actor capable of all genres. You won't be able to see a string of Obi-wen Kenobi or the shadow of Trainspotting in him. He is the poet and always the love-obsessed poet Christian in the movie. The supporting cast was also very outstanding. The stage manager, the maid, the playwriting gang and of course the Duke were all very important sidelines of the story. Their relationships with the leading actors spelled out the complexity of human relationships and love, which could be constructive or detrimental.The cinematography of the movie is superb, despite you can see a strong Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet feel. The application of colours was more intense when compared to Romeo and Juliet, probably because this is about a nightclub, which should always be full of life, and colour is a way to bring a building to life. If you are interested in interior designing, Moulin Rouge's interior design is eye dropping. This is because, they really helped to tell the story too.The soundtrack is also ear catching. Since it is about Moulin Rouge, music could not be missed, but the fun part is that you could hear all the best popular music in the past 10 to 20 years, but they were rearranged in a modern form that fit the early 20th century. Not easy but they did it. The music was so rich that, you would really have the urge to follow their singing in the theatre. Of course, provided you do have a good understanding of the western pop culture.In all Moulin Rouge should be one of the movies that you should not miss. It could be one of the best movies in this summer. It is a big hit in Australia, and I do think that it could stir up echoes the western world.	5.0	A fabulous movie for all time to come.	2001-06-22	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	I had heard a lot of good things from friends about MOULIN ROUGE and critics seemed to love it. However, the only promotions I had seen for the film advertised the sexuality of the picture and nothing else. That made me a bit leery. However, after finally viewing the movie, I'm happy to say though the film is full of sexuality (notice I said sexuality and not sex) it's a great movie well worth watching.The plot of the film, about star-crossed lovers separated by different lifestyles is an old one; but makes for a great story when told well (by the way, in MOULIN ROUGE the poor man wins the girl in the end, but in a slight twist, fate intervenes). And in MOULIN ROUGE the story is told exceptionally well. The scenery and costumes are marvelous, capturing all the lively decadence that was the Moulin Rouge. The altered pop music score and soundtrack is brilliantly done and one can only hope that future films choosing to use this format will be as well done.Many have praised and much ballyhoo has been given to Nicole Kidman for her performance and she may end up garnishing an Oscar because of it. However, Kidman isn't the real star of this movie. The real star is Ewan McGregor. He pulls off one of the finest and most believable performances of his career. Not only that, but man can this boy sing? Did anyone ever know how good his pipes were? He could easily pull of a Broadway musical and it would be a treat to see him try. Now, I'm not dissing Kidman; she gives a fine performance and has a difficult role. Nevertheless, McGregor has been overlooked and he's the one who really pulls off the better performance. Besides, it is his character (Christian) and not Kidman's (Satine) that the story really revolves around. The supporting cast is wonderful as well.As for the movie overall. The first twenty minutes are really strange and bizarre. After that, the pace picks up and things make sense. It is as though Baz Luhrmann didn't know what kind of movie he was making, toyed about doing a musical farce, but finally decided to make a pop-cultured, new breed musical. I'm glad Luhrmann finally made up his mind.	4.0	And Now for Something Completely Different	2002-01-22	1	1	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2HWV3R9NE0H2M	"""ulfar"""	The story behind this movie is not very original as has been pointed out. This is a deliberate retelling of La Dame aux cam&eacute;lias or Camille by Dumas, a story which has been portrayed more often than it is possible to count. This is however the most original version based on that theme in a long while (since Verdi's La Traviata in my opinion). In fact this is one of the most visually and musically splendid films I've seen as well as one of the funniest. For instance when Zidler started speaking the lyrics from Like a Virgin the theater erupted in laughter (as on many other occasions).P.S. My experience after seeing it a few times with different people is that those who are not well acquainted with the (mostly well known) songs and lyrics beforehand are not quite able to appreciate the humour and irony of this movie. However everybody I know has been able to enjoy it as a great musical.	5.0	Original and enjoyable version of Camille	2002-01-05	0	0	0

It is an outrage, but not the outrage most reviewers think it is.  The nominating committee was half right.  It neglected to nominate Luhrmann; it ought also to have given the film a pass.Luhrmann is, it seems to me, the Cecil B. Demille of the current batch of MTV-inspired directors and his gimmicky film is as likely to be well-regarded twenty-thirty years hense as are the over-blown Demille creations.  Both made films that are vastly overstated, under-acted and over-rated.Finally, while I'm a Nicole Kidman fan, if she deserved a nomination as best actress, it ought to have come for her performance in the better -- by far -- Other film she made last year.	1.0	The Academy Award Committee Got It Half Right	2002-02-17	5	2	3

I rarely go to the movies, and I had high expectations of &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot; This is a rehashed love triangle story that features an earnest but poor writer, and a stereotypical, somewhat dim-witted rich guy, who is a duke to boot. Another rehashed thing about this project is its soundtrack. Does anyone in the movie business want anything original anymore?There was no real chemistry between the two main characters. In fact, I quickly found the poor, earnest writer obnoxious. I felt more sympathy for the duke. In the beginning, I felt this could be a fine film, because it was taking a really comic and farcical turn, but then a serious and oh-so-unoriginal love story enveloped everything. As a result, you have an unsuccessful mix of several genre: farce, tragedy, musical, and God knows what else. &quot;All you need is love.&quot; Bohemians stand up to the pressures of the real world and affirm their romantic ways. Please, spare me. I felt bored. Toward the end of the movie I felt compelled to look at my watch every other minute.I give this movie two strars for two reasons. First, Nicole Kidman looks charming and seductive--as she always does. And she really plays the part, her work ethic shows--as it always does. Second, the costumes did not disappoint. The production was really lavish. It turns out, all the hungry script writers notwithstanding, that a good script that would take full advantage of the actors' talents is, after all, hard to find.Michael Hart	2.0	Moulin Boring	2001-06-13	6	2	4

This movie is the movie to convert musical haters into lovers.On my initial viewing, I was incredibly confused and, admittedly, a little frightened by the filming technique. The film is a bit insane, but once you become accustomed to the style (or maybe watch it a second time), you will instantly fall in love with the bravery and passion this movie exhibits.The main characters, Christian and Satine, are two lovers who meet at the Parisian nightclub the Moulin Rouge. Satine is the star of the Moulin Rouge, it's ""sparkling diamond"". Christian is a writer who eventually gets commissioned to pen a show for the Moulin Rouge. His friends, a group of bohemian revolutionaries, provide support and comedy. Howard Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge, is a caricature in himself. He parades around wearing a top hat, red coattails, and sports two rosy spots on his cheeks. The film takes on a Bollywood-esque feel as it rolls along, incorporating dancing and singing elements.The soundtrack is phenomenal. It comprises mainly of modern songs, such as Elton John's ""Your Song"" and Sting's ""Roxeanne"" (my personal favourite), rewritten to suit the movie's plot and style.

You either completely &quot;get&quot; it...or you utterly don't......and for me to describe &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; would be a great disservice to the movie. Does it have more energy than any movie I've seen in years, yet is not an action testostronathon? Yup. Is it a pop-song composed musical set in a parralel trippy-verse where we're asked to believe not only that Christian (Ewan McGregor) is the world greatest poet, but that his poetry consists of modern pop-music? Yup. Do Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman generate more chemistry than any screen couple EVER, whilst singing Elton John-Nirvana-Madonna-Queen songs to one another (to say nothing of the rest of the brilliant cast)? Yup. And then some more of that same insanity.You'll either love it or you'll hate it. Regardless of which side of the coin you're on, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; has one of the best DVD treatments you'll ever encounter, with lots of featurettes and documentaries detailing the structure behind the madness, a couple of commentary tracks, multi-angle dance sequences...where you pick one of four angles and shuffle through to &quot;edit&quot; your own dance sequence (of four.) And there's so much more. Much like the movie, my words are only scratching &quot;Moulin Rouge's&quot; shiny surface.Regarding &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; I have found that for those who &quot;get&quot; it, the connection is deep, romantically intense and personal in nature. For myself, it acts as a spiritual remedy for life's trying times...whether the trial is individual, such as career apathy and dissatisfaction, or more universal in nature: a reminder of the good, the true, and the joyful creations of man at a time when the &quot;real&quot; world is responding to humanity's dark side.So check it out. If you &quot;get&quot; it, buy it. It will become one of your favorite DVD's...one you'll watch over and over again, with every viewing just as remarkable as the first.Or you'll really hate it.	5.0	The BEST DVD In My Collection.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3IK9BLS3BWM96	walter  flakus	There are many outstanding moments in this jazzed up versionof the Moulin Rogue story but somehow the film as a whole left me unsatisfied.  I had the feeling that it was just too &quot;Australian&quot; and that film musicals should be left up to Hollywood. These were supposed to be French characters, but they looked strictly Aussie.There is far too much fast cutting and almost subliminal editing in parts.Some of the sets seem kind of chintzy.Contrary to what many have said, I believe a major flaw was in the casting of Nichole Kidman as the ill-fated prostitute.  She is just not believable to my mind.	3.0	THE WHOLE IS LESS THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS	2001-12-20	13	1	12

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2KU5PG32H7QBN	"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic"""	This movie can be described in one word: ecclectic.  It goes from rehashed Whitney Houston songs to a revamped version of Madonna's &quot;Like A Virgin,&quot; this time sung my two slightly insane old men and a few of their mildly unusual servents.  But this also adds to the creativity and uniqueness of the movie, earning it a well-deserved Best Picture nomination.  The colors and art direction were spectacular and the acting was grand.  And the giant elephant was pretty awesome, as well.  This movie makes you laugh and it makes you cry.  But apparantly, it made a lot of people vomit it horror.  Yes, this movie is one of those &quot;either you love it or you hate it&quot; movies.  I, myself, love period films, as well as strange, quirky ones.  This movie was a mix of the two.  Therefore, I loved it.  And if you don't like either of those two qualities, I suggest you stop reading now.The synopsis is as follows: A young man, Christian (Ewan McGregor) moves to Paris, France to write a novel about love.  He finds himself trapped in an awkward situation with a group of musical-writing Bohemians.  From there they go to a night club known as the Moulin Rouge where Tolouse Letrec (?) tells Christian he is to meet the cortisan in her giant Elephant Room in the courtyard, and &quot;totawy awone.&quot;  There the cortizan, Satine (Nicole Kidman), mistakes him for a powerful man known as the Duke and this leads to many mixups, followed by a deal to turn the Moulin Rouge into a theater.  Among all of this is a love conflict that is somewhat unique.You see, this unusual movie also has a slightly original, but also quite unoriginal, love story.  Thank goodness Nicole Kidman plays Satine.  She is poised and has a lovely voice.  This was her breakaway role in which she proved herself as a true actress.  For this film she was nominated, and in 2002 won an Oscar for Best Actress for her role as Virginia Woolf in The Hours.  She is now playing Ada in the movie &quot;Cold Mountain,&quot; which is believed to be one of the big winners during this year's Oscars.  This movie marked the beginning of her well-deserved true acting career.  May she last forever.Bottom Line: Despite the often eccentric musical numbers, this movie will dance and sing in history forever as the brave and august film that it is and was meant to be.

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AHED4UYIF5BQ3	Wayne	Moulin Rouge is hands down one of the most amazing films ever created.  Its creativity and sheer energy is unsurpassed by any other film.  When I went to see it, I had no idea what I was about to sit through.  It began dark and mysterious and opened into a world of music and dance I will never forget.  When I heard of the release date for the DVD I reserved four copies right off the bat.  You have to see Moulin Rouge to witness this landmark in cinematic history.  Thank you Baz for giving our generation this film to cherish for years to come.	5.0	Best Film in Decades	2001-12-07	8	6	2

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1PAD9TUQM0I76	"W. Freeberg ""cubholio"""	Moulin Rouge is a strange bauble of a movie-musical. It is nearly undone by its own weight, especially musical numbers that seem earnest and silly, but then win their way over you with that same magic that has been lost in cinema, a magic that only the most exciting musical films can deliver.Ewan McGregor brings chills as Christian, especially as he delivers &quot;Your Song&quot;. Nicole Kidman sheds her ice princess mannerisms and invests a warmth I doubt she has ever delivered this strongly before.The film is a 4 1/2 star effort, but the DVD feels a little too packed with promotional items. Sure, it has the &quot;Marmalade&quot; video and MTV performance, but I didn't care about that. The additional disc has some interesting tidbits, but exemplifies what is wrong with &quot;special&quot; packaging in that it becomes a commercial for its investors and promotions team. Moulin Rouge is definitely worth having, but aside from film discussion and extra camera angles, the additional disc isn't anything special.	4.0	Delightful	2001-12-19	0	0	0

Yes it's crazzy, yes it's odd, yes it's historically incorect, but it's fun and it is full of vibrant energy. It is not quite your typical musical, but turn of the centry paris was not a typical town, and despite its flaws its an amazing and fun to watch movie.	5.0	Look...	2006-10-08	6	6	0

AndI was not disappointed, eventhough it's very different from the&quot;traditional&quot; musicals. Set in Paris in 1899 with music from today, this could easily backfire. But it really works. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are the main reason this works, I think.Who knew they could sing so well?The filming and use of color is also spectacular. And John Leguizamo does a great Toulouse Latrec. The only thing I didn't like was the use of Whitney Houston's &quot;I will always love you&quot; and Madonna's &quot;Like a virgin&quot;. Other than that, a great movie that I will definitely see again...	5.0	Moulin Rouge Rules	2001-11-09	1	0	1
B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2XY7164O8EJ0K	"""wildthing114"""	MOULIN ROUGE is one of the weirdest movies i've ever seen. It's very different and wildly entertaining. It's a musical/romance/fantasy. Nicole Kidman (Satine) and Ewan McGregor (Christian) give excellent performances. Who knew Nicole and Ewan could sing so well?! They hit every note. John Leguizamo is also great. Visually, this movie is incredible. The settings are magical and original. MOULIN ROUGE is like nothing else. There's singing, dancing, and out of this world dramatic, emotional, silly, and comical performances by the cast. MOULIN ROUGE is set in 19th century France but they sing a lot of modern pop songs (ie: &quot;your song&quot;, &quot;like a virgin&quot;, &quot;diamonds are a girls best friend&quot;, etc.) in here. It may seem a bit odd but it goes with the plot. The basic plot is about a writer that falls in love with a prostitute. Sounds pretty basic but this movie is anything but. It's eye-popping visuals, beautiful songs, outrageous coreography, and awesome acting will keep you entertained. MOULIN ROUGE is very &quot;over-the-top&quot; and may seem strange to some. But if you're willing to experice a movie like no other, then MOULIN ROUGE is a great place to start. The bonus stuff on the DVD is great too. Lots of stuff to check out. MOULIN ROUGE is a dazzler.	5.0	Absolutely Fantastic!	2001-12-28	0	0	0

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3GX2EHRWPWSWE	William J. Harper	"There are very few films that I will bail out on (hence the tag ""parachute film"") and not find something that will encourage me to see it through to the end despite misgivings - story line, acting, cinematography, screenplay, etc. - but this film was one of them. I can abide and even enjoy a gimmick-driven film if its other elements tower above a contrived story device to produce a satisfying result (e.g. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""Forrest Gump"") but have a hard time coping with a movie that is heavily dependent on multiple gimmicks. The music video style of ""Moulin Rouge"" was a bit disconcerting to me but I was still willing to hang in there in hopes of being won over by other elements of the film. That drive was quashed, however, by the second gimmick - 19th Century characters singing 20th Century songs. This reality skewing device was one two many for my taste and had me quickly abandoning this film in search for another less jarring. There is definitely an audience for ""Moulin Rogue"" but you will not find me in it's number."	1.0	A Parachute Film	2012-01-08	7	2	5

B00005QZ7U	Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AMMEMPM9MPS55	www.DavidLRattigan.com	Moulin Rouge is theatre as it should be. It is a feast for the senses, an enthralling and captivating spectacle that entertains, exhilarates, and grips the emotions. This is more than a movie: It is an experience. On more than one occasion I almost wanted to rise to my feet and applaud. For this reviewer, at least, Moulin Rouge was an absolute riot.For those who think the musical genre could never work again, save in the context of a Disney cartoon: Think again. The movie-musical receives here a glorious resurrection. Musical numbers are pulled off with style, wit and imagination, and the tongue is never far from the inside cheek, meaning that we never feel we are watching a movie that belongs to an earlier time. Tunes are drawn from an entire century or more of music, often hilariously executed (if I tell you that Madonna's Like a Virgin is staged in the mode of a show-stopping, toe-tapping Broadway musical number, you will gain an idea of the general tenor of the picture). The film's terrifically old-fashioned conventions are given a modern lilt, and are met with a refreshing and creative energy at the hands of veteran director, Baz Luhrmann (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo and Juliet). Shades of Shakespeare are everywhere seen. Stylistically, we are in the surreal world of Jeunet and Caro (Delicatessen, Amelie). Musically, this is in a category of its own, quite unparalleled.Don't be fooled into thinking this is nothing more than a cracked attempt at a musical revue. That was exactly the impression I had from the trailers, and it was with suspicion and hesitation that I rented this movie, at the recommendation of a friend. I wasn't to be disappointed: I had tremendous fun watching Moulin Rouge, and hope you will too.	5.0	Pure Theatre	2002-07-24	2	1	1

Never mind the complete non-believeabily of a singer dying of tuburculosis simultanously on key and on cue. It's amazing. The eye candy factor is over the top, and the musical duet numbers are superb; a blend of modern pop that is so catchy that now, when I hear that songs, I think of them as belonging to Moulin Rouge, not to themselves. There are elements of Fear and Loathing and Naked Lunch in the mix for a feeling of suureal, plus a touch, just a touch, of CGI. A perfect spice for the nearly perfect film.The costumes...oh MY my MY. Anyone who can costume Nicole Kidman to look even more amazingly sexy than normal deserves and Oscar in my book. But not just Nicole Kidman; every single person in the show was done up to perfection, even, and espcially, the Green Fairy.Someone did some homework: the real Moulin Rouge existed in the same time period and was in fact, frequented by the real Toulouse-Latrec (playing the talking sitar), and had a singer much like Satine who was prone to, say, knocking the hat off the Price of Wales with a high kick while the owner shouted ""Hullo, Prince, is your Mummy paying for the drinks tonight?""So yes, huzzah, I LOVE this film, even though sometimes I have to play it at half speed.
