0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2YK2MBP8KH1FD	"A. Carey ""adamarket"""	At last Disney gets it right. Of all the Disney DVDs I've bought my daughter, this was the first one to get it right (Dumbo the 60th anniversary edition is pretty good too).Aside from having cleaned the movie up until it looks even better than when it was originally released in 1937 (a process explored on one of the disks), this release of Snow White includes a detailed look at how the movie came into being, from initial sketches to how it was marketed via old trailers and movie posters.I always appreciate seeing the original drawings and sketches when an animated feature is the topic of discussion. It's interesting to note how the witch changed from being a frumpy Alice in Wonderland-type character to the more svelte looking queen we know today. This image was almost duplicated by the producers of The Wizard of Oz who fortunately decided to go for a more traditional looking witch prior to shooting (but that's another DVD extra).The disk also explores how Snow White was technically produced. I particularly enjoyed the segment on how Disney pioneered the use of a multi-plane camera (which I now recognize whenever I watch other Disney movies for its unique quality of depth).The DVD also offers some fun, interactive items. My daughter loves Dopey's Wild Ride, where she has to answer questions in order to help Dopey save Snow White.Overall, this is the best release this movie could have possibly received. I rank this DVD right up there with The Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka and Shrek for its robust and extensive complement of extras. It's nice when the extras on a DVD become almost as worthwhile as the original movie.	5.0	Snow White is fully loaded even without 7 Dwarves	2001-12-12	2	1	1

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A69ORVVZQ6BJN	A Customer	Snow White is one of the greatest animated films of all time, and thus deserves the golden treatment for DVD. For once, the home video department at Disney doesn't fail us.Both discs included allow you to fully understand the process behind making Snow White. Areas like the Abandoned Concepts, Deleted Scenes, and the Camera Tests are all fasinating. The archival radio recordings and trailers too are a great look at the past.I do have to note that some of the extras glorify Disney (the company) maybe a little much. The &quot;Disney Through the Decades&quot; extra is wasted, what with Jodi Benson and Ming-Na telling us how great it is that Disney has their own hockey team and such.But dispite these flaws, Snow White is still a must own disc. The film still holds as a classic, and the extras are definately worth checking out. There may be better DVDs, but I honestly can't think of any off the top of my head.	4.0	A great DVD even for non-Snow White fans	2001-10-19	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2GR3H560WKCPX	A Customer	"DISNEY has finally come to their senses!!!  I am an avid DVD collector (200+) and I do not own a single Disney-animated DVD.  Why?  For years, people have been begging Disney to put their massive catalog on DVD.  Disney obliged and the resulting DVDs were horrible- nothing more than inadequate upgrades from their previous VHS format.  Simply put, their presentation in the ever-so-popular DVD format was RIDICULOUSLY skimpy (in terms of bonus features)!!!  Do you remember the 9-DVD box set they put out in 1999 for $300?  They called it &quot;The Classic Disney DVD Collector's Set!&quot;  HA!!  It was a box of tripe!  The box was anything BUT ""classic.""  It included none of the memorable DVDs of days gone by.  FAST FORWARD 2 YEARS...they have sold millions of &quot;bare-bone&quot; DVDs and now are re-re-re-re-re-releasing them to the public...in a format they should've been in initially!  Either Disney purposely planned to MILK MILLIONS from their customer base or someone threw a brick upside their heads- finally making them comes to their senses.  Whatever the case, the latter case being said in EXTREME sarcasm, Disney is finally starting to release QUALITY DVDs.The PLATINUM 2-DISC edition of Snow White is a must have for everyone.  The picture and sound on both discs are flawless.  The sound on each disc is THX certified and has been remixed in Dolby Digital 5.1 (English &amp; French).  Also, BOTH DISCS have a truckload of features including rare newsreel footage from the premiere, an insightful look at the restoration process, archaic featurettes and original trailers!  WAY TO GO DISNEY!  This set is truly worth every penny!  My only hope is that Disney will continue to do this with future titles and re-re-re-re-re-release all of the classics (The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Sleeping Beauty, etc.).

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AKMQ4GM0YRD89	Adam Turney	Sleeping Beauty on Blu-ray was an amazing spectacle and took the movie to new levels in quality.  However, Disney was not able to do the same with Snow White.  Personally I do not like the movie or songs, but the visually and audio quality are not on par with Sleeping Beauty.  Certainly it is an old movie, but it did not meet my expectations.	3.0	A Classic but Not Impressed	2010-05-30	9	1	8
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	ADLVFFE4VBT8	"A. Dent ""Aragorn"""	The Blu-ray release of the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is one of the slickest releases in Blu-ray history so far. It excels on every count: packaging, visual and audio presentation, the amount and depth of extra features and and all of the above at a retail price below most much less ambitious Blu-ray titles.I will briefly justify why I believe that this is a 'must have' 5-star for anyone who who watches or has kids who watch Disney animations.PACKAGINGOnce you remove the 3-D sleeve, the solid plastic (unlike the more recent 'cheap' Blu releases, this case does not have holes punched in it to save a penny or 2) you will find a Blu-ray guide attached to the inside front cover. The 'navigational overview' tree of the 2 Blu-ray disks is actually needed do to the almost baroque layout of features with some, such as the Hyperion Studios extra found on the Bonus disk with dozens of subfeatures within the feature. The inside cover itself lists the 27 movie 'scenes'.There are 3 disks:- The Feature Disk has the 84-minute movie plus a host of extra features.- The Bonus Disk has even more extras including the already mentioned 'Hyperion Studios'.- The DVD Feature Disk has the full movie once again.VISUAL AND AUDIO PRESENTATIONObviously, the original is greatly cleaned and enhanced to take advantage of Blu's 1080p superior resolution but that's not all.The optional DisneyView mode would make watching more enjoyable by filling the right and left side bars (the original is in a 3x4 format) with a static filler that changes with each scene matching the scene's own background, creating the impression that one is watching a 'wide screen' movie.Most of the extras are shot in uncompromising 1080p resolution.The highest audio resolution is 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio with 5.1 surround available for French and Spanish. The original soundtrack is also included for reference.An audio commentary track is available on the Feature Disk.EXTRA FEATURESThey run the whole gamut. The Feature Disk has the expected and inevitable - but in this case with a twist - 'deleted scenes', several 'remote control games', a music video of 'Some Day My Prince Will Come' and a 'Princess and the Frog' sneak peak.The Bonus Disk has two main section.There's the 'Classic bonus features' that has content we would normally expect on a bonus disk - Heigh-Ho Karaoke sing-along, Dopey's Wild Mine Ride, Disney Through the Decades, Animation Voice Talent.And then there's the absolutely amazing Hyperion Studios feature. It must be the most innovative 'bonus' making this purchase worth it for anyone who may already have the movie on DVD. Architected more or less like a hypertext document, it allows the viewer to freely jump in and out featurettes dealing with the history of Disney, the animators, the making of various aspects of the movie, the cultural impact of Snow White and of Disney. And the above are put together with historians and some of the original animators talking, original story boards, full-length, uncut Disney 'shorts', reconstructed and re-enacted Walt Disney and animators commentary to specific scenes and their thoughts and views as the scenes were developed... like I said, simply amazing if you add the never-before-used interface and you consider the extra-crisp quality of the entire presentation.MY CONCLUSIONI already stated it in the second paragraph of this review: if you are into animation and Disney, get it without hesitation. It's a steal.	5.0	Restored/enhanced feature movie, amazing extras, included DVD - it's a steal	2009-10-25	1	1	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AMP7TQRWAIE84	"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D"""	This movie has a lot of charm, but sometimes it's a little boring.Snow White is cute and all. And she has an alright personality. But I feel this movie lacks some of the perfection that other titles such asPeter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition),The Lion King (Disney Special Platinum Edition)andThe Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)had.The animals add a lot to the overall innocent feel to the movie. And like I said, Snow White has the perfect, girl-next-door personality.I'm sure I was watching the restored version, but from what I did see, the movie has aged really well considering it was from 1937. That was 72+ years ago!I really enjoyed watching them all dance with Snow White. It was cute.All in all, a good movie for kids and some adults to enjoy. Grumpy's comments and Dopey's actions were the funniest.3.75 stars or a 7.5/10.	3.0	Cute, classic movie. 3.75 stars.	2010-03-10	2	1	1

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A32O98PFC3OP7K	A Gamer at Heart	This classic Disney tale really shines in this beautiful transfer to Blu-Ray.  The hand-drawn animation, along with stunning imagery and colors, is finely showcased in high definition.  The Dolby mix really brings new life to all the classic Disney songs in this feature, and I was pleasantly suprised that the audio had been re-mixed to take advantage of ambient surround effects.  The Blu-Ray has everything you would expect - stunning picture and sound quality. Animation always looks pretty good in high definition, and the old school, classic Disney animation in this movie is no exception.  You can certainly see the difference in fine detail and movement in such animation in comparison to modern computer-generated Pixar fare, but the subtle reduction in perfect, life-like movement is made-up for with the classic style, look and feel of animation from classic Disney.As far as the story goes, who doesn't know that Snow White must be saved from the vain and murderous Queen?  The story still resonates with young children - my youngest was on the edge of her seat throughout the movie.  The disc combo is priced at a bargain, and makes a nice addition to any classic Disney or home-library collection.	4.0	ENDURES THE TEST OF TIME	2009-10-19	0	0	0

The colors are brighter, the sound is outstanding and the whole experience is wonderful!  This set comes with the standard DVD (great for car trips!) and the Blu-ray DVD of the movie and a Blu-Ray Bonus Features disk.I hadn't seen this movie in years, and was anxious to share it with my children.  We popped some popcorn, snuggled together on the couch and watched the show.  My boys are 6 and 4 and were positively mesmerized!  They laughed at the dwarfs and were nervous about the ""mean lady"" and the poisoned apple.  I'm still humming ""Someday My Prince Will Come."" The story is just as wonderful as you remember - true love prevails!My guys also enjoyed the trailer for The Princess and The Frog.

Inside there are several brochures as well as a colorful and easy to follow DVD guide.  As for the movie, the color is gorgeous and the HD sound is crisp and clear.  The whole family enjoyed this classic tale.  Just the movie and its quality would be enough to get me to purchase this DVD--however, it is loaded with bonus features that kept us busy for hours!  The Karaoke Sing-a-Long and ""Which Princess are You?"" quiz were favorites.  There are so many fun games, backstage peeks, and more...your family will love it!  I also love the fact they Disney packaged this edition with Blu-Ray AND a DVD.  We currently don't own a Blu-Ray player but plan to have one in the future, so this is a perfect set.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1DTCJV6KOMJOA	A*	Snow White is the first full length animated featured film Disney ever released and it is the most well rounded of them all. It may not have the most dazzling animation that belongs to Pinochio or the best music that's Fantasia but Snow White has the most heart of all the Disney flicks - even the ones made today! Teh story should be familiar to everyone buy now a beautiful young Snow White is hated by her Evil but beautiful Stepmother. So with the Stepmother being the Queen and Snow white the princess she is cast out of the royal home and into the forrest. As the DVD unravelles images and fears of childhood pop in your mind faster then Orville Reddenbaucher in a microwave! When Snow White is about to be killed by a huntsman who is fulfilling the queens first attempt to kill her, the shadow his large frame casts over her demure frame still shakes the viewers nerves. The glit of the knife and the glowing green in the hunters eyes is just a sight to behold! When I first saw this film as a child two images were etched into my mind the; the image of Snow White running through the forrest, her milk colored skin being dimmed by the dark night and the shadows from the trees that seem to be alive-tugging and pulling on Snow White as she runs for her life! The other image is the coffin. The glass shimmers and the sun light's rays seem to dance revealing a surreal image of sorrow and pain for the seven dwarfs (Doc's my favorite) and animals who surrond it. All though it has been years- almost 70 infact the DVD transfer is perfect. The colors pop and the 3D effect of the flick is not lost for a second the image is so clear and wonderous that you can make out the Dwarfs buy the color of their clothes. Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is a hand drawn masterpiece! The animation is so precise and the film so entrancing and atmospheric that it seems to unravel like a dream. Remember when you were little and you played alone in your room you never really did some wher ein the back of your mind you had a friend or an audience or played with your toys in your mind first and then you ran to go make your daydream come to life through your toys! Well, Snow White is like the ultimate kids dream that every child has had. It turns the viewer into a star letting your screams, cheers and laughter blend into the story by not only giving you a reason to react but a reason to watch it over and over again and the reason is Snow White she is every child before the world shapes us. Disney gives the adult the ultimate DVD the extras are so and enthralling that the hours Disney put into them seems to fly buy! The film Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is a must own! Rather its the first time the animals meet the outcasted Snow White or the singing of &quot;Whistle While You Work&quot; you will find yourself living in the dreams of the past and the viewing of this flick in the present!	5.0	A Child's Dream Told  As An Animated Masterpiece!	2001-09-28	2	2	0

Of course the movie is about a million years old (well maybe not that old), so some things may seem a little out of date. However, I've watched it a few times and have never gotten bored of it. I don't have any children, but I did watch it with my goddaughter (who is 3), and she loved it! She did get a bit scared on the part the witch is running and it's raining, but apparently not enough, since she then wanted to see the movie again. I think overall the movie is great, both the story and the DVD version. It is a real shame that is not available to purchase anymore.	5.0	Great movie!	2005-02-23	4	3	1
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A19K5DILM15WU3	Alex	(My original review of the DVD has been edited to refer to the Limited Edition Collector's Set Blu-Ray).I pre-ordered the Limited Edition Diamond Collector's Set because I'm a big Disney and Snow White fan. I was blown away by how nice the set really is. The box is lined in velvet with gold embossments. The lithographs are of pencil animation, so you get to see all of the animator's original pencil lines. The pin set is adorable. And the book is the real centerpiece of this box set. It gives details about the production, as well as provides information about the legacy the film has had. It is full of rare pictures. The book also features the story of Snow White, told through concept art and stills from the film. The book is absolutely gorgeous.As for the Blu-Ray itself, the film hasn't looked this good since its original release in 1937. Disney's restoration team deserves a pat on the back for a job well done. The transfer on Blu-Ray is immaculate. It's so clean that you can see some of the animation flaws if you look closely. In terms of bonus features, Disney has done a thorough job. If you do everything in the immersive Hyperion Studios feature, it takes more than 4 hours to get through. Add that to the recycled bonus features from the Platinum Edition DVD and you have almost more than you could ask for. The bonus DVD copy of the film is a nice touch, since we have 1 Blu-Ray player, but 4 DVD players, so now we can enjoy Walt Disney's classic on any of our TVs.If you are a more casual fan, this collector's set probably isn't for you. But if you are a huge fan of the film or Disney in general, this set is a must-have. It's worth the price.	5.0	The Fairest Collector's Set Of Them All	2001-08-02	15	14	1

I've been reading that people have been having trouble playing the Blu Ray version on some older Blue Ray player models.

So I get the package ontime, which I was happy about, open it and there is a Burned copy of the disk is there. I can say they did a great job by putting the picture on the disk and making a decent looking package but the disk when you looked at it was blurry. Also there was 2 disks not three.The outside package was folded and tapped and it had written on the back of it kodak paper. Really now, when did kodak start making the movie covers for disney? Ill answer it for you, they didnt. I didnt bother playing the disk because it wassnt a orginal Disney blu ray.

It is truly an amazing piece that Disney has put out. The clarity, color and sound of the restored movie is outstanding. The extras on these discs though, is the main reason I bought the DVD. This is what DVD's are all about. Disney Pioneered the animation field with this movie, and are trying to do the same with this DVD. There are literally over 25 hours of entertainment on this set, and many, many interesting behind the scenes segments, and &quot;How'd they do that?&quot; features on the making of the movie, and the history of the Snow White story. This is a limited edition, so I would say grab it up while you can. I am eagerly looking forward to the Disney DVD release of the Mickey Mouse cartoons. I will be buying that, and along with this Snow White DVD, these are my first purchases made with my future children in mind.

Sounds really good doesn't it? Well, it would be if this was a film like say 'Die Hard' that wasn't originally done in older animation-style.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	"To attack a classic such as `Snow White' could be perceived as sacrilegious by some (or many) but I've never been one to completely shy away from a controversial opinion (note my particularly scathing reviews of `Rocky', `Avatar' and `The Terminator', not to mention my FOUR STAR assessment of `Gone With The Wind' for further proof) and so I will now attempt to state my case.Mind you, I absolutely loved this movie, gave it five stars and consider it one of the best films of the 30's, which was a very rich decade in the world of cinema.So I guess maybe attack isn't the right word to use.  Maybe it's more like `criticize' but in the slightest degree.  Maybe I should start with the positives here.  For Disney's first animated feature (you hear that?  FIRST!) it is beautiful to look at and it really stands the tests of time as far as a visual marvel.  Yes, many claim `Sleeping Beauty' to be that `landmark' in animation, and it was but this was the first one out the gate and look at how heartwarming the visuals make the soul.  The singing, while not as crisp and compelling as later years (I mean, Snow White pales in comparison to Ariel) has a long-lasting quality that adds a certain dynamic to the films overall preservation.  The character development, while seemingly minimal, is actually surprisingly deep, especially when one takes into account the complexities of the allegory.  While seemingly simple, the film's overall stance on the subject of aging and beauty is astute and poignant; and transcendent.With all these wonderful things to say about the film, one thing that bugs me to no end is the fact that this is considered one of the best Children's films of all time.  I have a hard time considering this a Children's film.  The themes are VERY dark and at times even disturbing.  There are always elements of danger and gloom present in Disney films, but there is something almost eerily barbaric about the message this film is presenting.I will kill you because you are prettier than me; and that fact is discussed very openly and without any restraint.""KILL HER!""""BRING ME HER HEART!""It can be somewhat scaring to a young child, especially a young girl.  Now one may balk and list other Disney films that have failed to receive the stigma that has been cast in ""Snow Whites' direction, such as `The Lion King' or `Beauty and the Beast' and I am forced to consider the double standard that seems to be present, albeit relevant, in that the idea of a man being killed out of anger is far less scaring than the murder of a young girl.  Yes, `Snow White' is a classic, and as far as `films' go, this one is at the top of the pier, but denying the fact that the film could be terrifying to a young child is something I cannot do."	5.0	Bloody snow...	2010-11-30	4	1	3

Unfortunately, when we tried to play it in the living room, all we got was a lot of noise from the machine and ""Disk Error"" on the screen. Needless to say I was not very happy. We tried it in the DVD player in my bedroom and it does work in there although the entire time it plays you can hear the disk inside the machine.

We bought it strictly for entertainment purposes.  I say I think it was duped because every 10 minutes or so a video recorder icon comes up on the right hand screen and the inside of the video - where the DVD's are - is not at all like the other Disney Videos we have bought directly from the store.  Would I buy from the seller again - yes I would because as I said - we buy them strictly for entertainment.

Words cannot describe how flawless this dvd is. It is the best treatment I have ever seen on any dvd. I will not bore you with plot details, as everybody knows what this film is all about. I will say, however, that the film looks and sounds great. They also loaded it with extras. Dozens of documentaries, interviews and much more are littered throughout this magical I wish I could say more, but my praise for this dvd cannot be expressed in mere words. In order to see what I mean, you have to buy the dvd for yourself and see how great it is. And of course, watch the film, too.

I enjoy the DVD menu feature so I can JUMP to an area and on this DVD you can slowly meander to that area.  The Dopey Mine game is fun...once.  Then you realize that the alternative path is only different in 1 aspect and then you are bored.  The add-on bonus features in the Platinum Edition are cool and the archival info well worth it for a colllector. But for an impatient adult, and a toddler who does not understand the process the menu action is faulty.	3.0	Slow Manuevering DVD (Great Content poor execution)	2001-11-28	7	5	2

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	ARA48345JZPZR	Archmaker	Nearly 2/3's of a century later, Snow White &amp; the Seven Dwarfs still has the power to enchant and amuse and beguile.  The restoration is fabulous, with clean, crisp &amp; clear picture and beautiful digitized sound.  It looks and sounds as it must have been intended, if not better, and this first full-length animated story still delivers.  Your children and grandchildren should love it.There are two Discs just chock-a-block with goodies.  There are documentaries, background stories, features on animation, games for the kids, galleries of original drawings, deleted sequences and so on.  As much or more than you ever wanted to know about the making of this landmark film.  There is so much to see that more than one viewing is essential.I found the influences of European artists Disney brought in to create the overall look of the film, evoking German fairy tales, interesting.  Of course there is the inevitable Disney Co. commercial inherent in some of the presentation (they are a Marketing juggernaut in case you didn't notice), but that is to be expected and is minor.  The different Special Features are beautifully presented with new animation and different human guides.If you are interested in what went into making a landmark of animation, you will certainly find something of interest here.  If not, you still have the marvelously presented feature itself.After viewing most of all of the 2 discs, what struck me most was a renewed respect for Walt Disney's courage and vision.  He continually bet the farm (with brother Roy backing him) on his own gut instincts &amp; intuition.  That, and his absolute demand for craft and creativity and excellence.  I grew up with Uncle Walt, on TV and successful,  and it is good to remember that he had no safety net or guarantees when he layed it all on the line for what he wanted to do.  He was a true American genius, a crazy combination of savvy entrepeneur, craftsman, artist, visionary, gambler, and Marketing whiz.  He was one in a million.	5.0	Uncle Walt's Timeless Gift.	2001-10-09	7	7	0

It is incredible to see a movie as old as Snow White come to life, fully restored, in high definition glory. I have never seen Snow White before like I watched it this evening with my kids, who were watching it for the first time. I had forgotten how shrill Snow White's voice is!Movie: 5.0/5.0Video: 4.9/5.0Audio: 5.0/5.0Extras: 4.0/5.0Overall: 4.8/5.0This release is nearly flawless in every way and with current promotions is only $10.00!!! I have purchased 5 of them to give away as Christmas presents. Disney has even included a full DVD copy for those who have an extra tv in the kids play room or have yet to adopt the blu-ray format but want to take advantage of the savings.One of my favorite parts of these older releases is the DisneyView that adds artwork to what would otherwise be black bars on the left and right side of the screen. The movie has been cleaned of all artifacts, grain, wash out, and is just brilliant for a 1930's film. It is a worthy addition to your collection and if you still haven't gotten a blu-ray player (which is being adopted faster than DVD) this blu-ray is a very good reason to add it to your Christmas wish list.I do feel we were a little short on extras for this release, but nothing to sneeze at. My favorites included the deleted scenes and look into Disney archive research facility.This film was watched on the following: 52"" Sony Bravia HDTV, Sony S550 blu-ray player with HDMI connection, 5.1 Yamaha home theater system."	5.0	A near perfect release of Disney's First Film	2009-10-06	2	1	1

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2C27IQUH9N1Z	audrey	You could never accuse the guys at Disney of being on the cutting edge of progressive social thought, but they sure knew about fun -- and the current crew augments that same idea of fun with the latest technology by coming up with the best bells and whistles I've seen on a DVD.  There are two discs to hold it all -- pretty remarkable when you condsider that the movie itself is only 84 minutes long.The movie looks and sounds great .... a beautiful restoration.  Images are sharp, sound is clear.  You can listen to the original mono soundtrack, or an improved digital track in English or French.  If you choose French, even the opening sequence of a printed fairy tale book appears in French.  Pretty cool.The extras include Streisand singing 'Some Day My Prince Will Come'; a karaoke edition of 'Heigh Ho'; a 39-minute documentary about the making of the film narrated by Angela Lansbury; audio commentary by Walt Disney himself, pieced together from archived materials; an animated short used to test some of the animation; and Dopey's Wild Mine Ride -- a great little trivia/puzzle game -- and that's just the first disk!The second disk is spectacular -- there are dozens of elements here, but I will mention (what I consider to be) the best: storyboard/film comparison; scenes deleted from the film (including a great scene of the dwarves making Snow White a bed, with comments penciled in by an animator); camera tests; featurettes about the voices, audio sessions, restoration of the film, and artistic concepts -- layouts, backgrounds, character sketches and development; publicity materials (posters, photos, trailers, radio commercials); and a timeline of the history of the film *and* Disney studios.The amount (and quality) of extras is truly incredible; and there is a well-designed print brochure, as well as on-disk tours of the material, to help you find your way around.This is a great version of a wonderful film -- and an exemplary use of the DVD format.Highly recommended.	5.0	Snow White has bells!

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	Disney's first feature-length animation, and a genuine classic. But you do have to remember that it's 1937 as you view this film. Also, it was adapted from a traditional story, one of the ones collected by the brothers Grimm. So try not to get hung up on the sexism involved. Believe me, they thought they were honoring women when they made them princesses who fell in love at a glance with a handsome prince. Who has but one wish: for her prince to find her and carry her away to his castle.Oh, yes; and for Grumpy to like her. She gets both wishes, of course.It seems I had not remembered much about the story, and probably saw only edited versions on television all those years ago. Some silly things struck me, like the fact that the dwarfs mine fully cut gems, not natural crystals. Presumably Disney felt his young audience would not know them for gems if they were uncut. And there is the really hilarious scene where Snow White tells the dwarfs they must wash up before dinner. I remember some parts, but it was a disconnected, chaotic scene to my childish mind. Same with the woodland animals who helped Snow White clean up the cottage.It's a pretty movie, and part of our cultural heritage. If you have kids and/or grandkids, you really should consider buying it. And no matter who you are, I think you'll notice things you missed. I certainly did.	4.0	It's Kept It's Charm for 70 Years!	2012-05-10	1	1	0

I love the scenes with the small animals and the scene with the lost small bird is so cute. This is certainly one of Walt Disneys best movies and certainly a nugget in the Disney cartoon vault. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.	5.0	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Disney Special Platinum Edition)	2010-12-29	0	0	0

Although it was an experimental film at the time of its release (no one had ever made a full-length animated feature before), there is not a hint that the creators at Disney didn't know exactly what they were doing when they made this beautiful movie.  The DVD features a perfectly cleaned up picture and soundtrack.  Everything looks and sounds beautiful.  The extra features are QUITE extensive as well; documentaries, behind-the-scenes, interviews, games, deleted scenes, alternate music tracks, you name it, it is here!

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	To truly appreciate this film one should remember that `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' was released in '37 making it's production an incredible achievement in animation considering the overall state of the art at the time. This film was the spring board for the many Disney classics to follow in the years ahead making it a classic by that standard alone.However having that said, after all these years the film can still stand on its own merits. The animation is enjoyable, the soundtrack is enchanting, at times haunting and the seven dwarfs are beloved by millions around the world. It may not be technically the best of Disney's animated films but it was the benchmark of all that was to follow and still has a loyal fan base after all these years. A true classic.	5.0	"""With A Smile And A Song"" ~ The Birth Of An American Dynasty"	2007-04-06	3	3	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1C7OW2QBJKU6J	Brooks Austin	"Based on the classic fairytale, Disney's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is often held as being the first successfully animated feature presented in technicolor, but people back in the 1930s must not have been too hard to please because I really don't see what's so special about this movie.  To me, Snow White remains who is most likely Disney's most annoying heroine.  All she does throughout the entire movie is whine about her plight and complain about the dwarfs' manners constantly.  When the dwarfs invite her to stay in their house, she suddenly takes over as a motherly figure and bossing everyone around just because she's a princess, completly forgetting the fact that she's the one who's the guest, not the other way around, and treating the dwarves like immature children when they're clearly adult men.  What the dwarfs or the evil queen's magic mirror see in her that's so ""fair"" I really can't see myself.Snow White's relationship with the Prince is completly unbelievable.  She only meets him once and is instantly sure that he's her true love, even though they know nothing about each other.  They don't even reveal the Prince's name at all and the Prince doesn't appear again until the last scene of the film.  He doesn't even kiss Snow White because he's been searching for her out of love, he kisses her just because he heard about a beautiful sleeping princess in the forest.  He didn't do a single thing to fight against the evil queen.  The dwarves did far more to protect Snow White than the Prince did yet when the Prince wakes her up with his kiss, she's instantly in love with him, they magically get married and live happily ever after, so what gratitude does she show to the dwarves?  She says goodbye to them and says thank you and goes off to live in a fancy castle while the dwarves are left by themselves in the forest.There is very little to virtually zero character development in this film.  Almost all the characters expect for Grumpy remain the same.  Grumpy starts off hating Snow White but he eventually loves her too and is the only one who goes through such development, which is why he's the only character in this movie that I liked.  The animation still manages to be impressive despite the film's old age.  There's a great deal of detailed animation given to the beautiful backgrounds and Snow White features a lot of unique and fun designs for its cast of characters, especially for all the loveable animals and the dwarves.  But Disney at this point obviously couldn't properly animate adult males as they avoided animating the Prince as much as possible, hence why he only appears in two scenes throughout the entire film.The musical score is sadly very forgettable as most of the background music sounds more or less the same without any real distinctive tunes that really stand out.  The only vocal songs in this film that I actually enjoyed were the classic songs ""Whistle While You Work"" and ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" but all the rest of the songs I could care less about.  Most of the humor in the film comes from the animals and the dwarves trying their hardest to look cute enough to make you want to go out and buy their merchandise and not much else.  The film could've been much shorter than what it was and the story be completly unaffected, but it drags itself out longer than it should with all the useless cute animal scenes when they could've been using this time to develop the characters more.  Despite its faults, Snow White will always be remembered as a classic for its impressive animation, entirely free from the taint of today's overly-abused CGI animation, and for being Disney's first animated movie.  Younger children and diehard Disney fans will love this movie for its historical importance in the world of animation, but those looking for solid entertainment will find themselves bored by the movie's paper-thin plot, bland characters, and dull music."	2.0	Over-rated classic	2006-07-08	25	7	18
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3EW2L59UBHQSG	Bruce Aguilar	After all these years, Snow White still shines like a gem! Of course a lot of that has to do with the amazing restoration work, but if the detail wasn't there to begin with, we wouldn't be seeing it now. Simply put, this film set the standard for all animated films to follow. Even to this day films are compared to it and judged against it. But it's not only a landmark film, it's an incredibly entertaining one! Sure it's dated in some of it's characterizations, but amazingly it still works.Thankfully this Blu-ray (BD) and DVD package lovingly and in exacting detail preserves this national treasure. Disney has set and raised the bar for prestige presentation with this set.Snow White has been delicately restored and the high resolution of BD shows off the hard work in exacting detail. Colors pop, lines are razor sharp (check out the lettering on the storybook that opens the movie) and the dimensionality that's always been present now is unmistakable. The soundtrack has also been restored and remixed. Simply put there has never been a better way to enjoy the film.If however, you don't have a BD player yet, you can still get use from this set as it comes with a single DVD of the movie as well. How is that for making your dreams come true? Of course this new DVD doesn't reach the astounding quality of the BD but it does looks better than the Platinum release of 2001.The set is jam packed with bonus features, most of which appear on the second BD disc. The same commentary from the Platinum DVD, many games, a feature on the lasting influence of Snow White and newly discovered storyboards for a follow-up short that was never produced. But by far the highlight of the bonus features is the Hyperion Studios segment which through animated still photography, audio clips and current animators as hosts brings Walt's original studio to life like never before. You've got to see it to believe it. I've read quite a lot about the Hyperion Studios but this is first time it's ever felt really alive. What helps to achieve that is that you actually travel from room to room of the Hyperion Studios learning about the development of the film and gaining insight on the people who made this masterpiece. All of it done with vintage films, audio clips, production artwork and interviews. It's a remarkable piece of work that took me over an hour to get through.Disney has been doing some especially impressive releases of it's classics on BD, but this release of Snow White takes everything just a step further. There's something here for everyone, children, animation buffs, movie historians, disneyphiles, and those just looking to be entertained. There are a few bonus features not carried over from the 2001 Platinum DVD release (which itself was missing features from the laserdisc release), but only an evil stepmother would let that stop them from enjoying this amazing set.	5.0	Blu-ray Makes Snow White Fairer Still	2001-10-30	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1GB1Q193DNFGR	Bruce Lee Pullen	After four largely arduous years of painstaking development, when Walt Disney released his initial full-length animated feature upon the world in 1937, every reputable cinema insider, film critic, studio executive, and film business analyst at the time considered this Grimm Fairy based cartoon movie (nicknamed Disney's Folly) to be nothing more or less than professional suicide. Who they considered in their sane minds would sit through an hour and a half cartoon. Primarily who could stand such a prolonged exposure to such brightly tinted colors, conceptually unrealistic images, and plausibly inane child oriented entertainment for such a significant duration. It appeared to the Silver Screen industry that the immensely popular Disney animation studio responsible for such lucrative successes as Steamboat Willie (1st sound animated short) and Flowers and Trees (1st Color animated short) had plundered all of it's amassed wealth and interests into a project that would single-handedly signify it's obituary.With such a relentless stench of failure looming over it's theatrical release on December 21,1937, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs astoundingly persevered over all of the nay-saying gossip and metamorphosed into an international cultural phenomenon (that comparatively by 1937 standards received crudely equivalent revenue to other film blockbusters such as Star Wars, Jaws, or the Godfather) that heralded in the inception of the Animated Feature as incredibly viable cinematic genre, bolstered the Walt Disney Animated Studios as major Tinsel town heavyweight, and kick started the golden age of Disney Animation that included such milestones as Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi.Amidst the aftermath of it's gargantuan success, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs earned a special technical Academy Award celebrating Disney's massive advances in the art of animation (the award consisted of one large golden statuette and seven miniature ones), created both the massive demand and financial revenue necessary to sustain Disney Studios for years to come, and inspired countless generations of fans to seek animation as a career field. Yet sixty-four years after it was first cherished and adored by children and adults alike, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs still lingers as a colossally endearing cinematic landmark that habitually enthralls, frequently delights, and metaphysically transports us (the adults) to that intangible childhood glee and innocence that is so unfortunately lacking in our lives most of the time. It was the imagination kaleidoscope for generations of children, the granddaddy template for ALL animation films to follow, and the film that introduced such unforgettable characters as Happy, Doc, Bashful, Sneezy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey, Snow White, and the Evil Queen to our collective unconscious for all time. Would really want to have it any other way?As for the Disney Platinum Edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it contains a entrancingly THX remastered print of Snow White, a highly informative making-of documentary, deleted scenes (including the famous Soup, Making a Bed for Snow White, Doc and Grumpy's bedroom brawl, and many others) feature commentary, rare inclusive historical drawings, a Disney through the years prospective documentary, rare aborted idea storyboards for Snow White including a fantasy rendition of Someday My Prince will come, the Prince's incarceration at the Evil Queen's castle, and countless others, and numerous other first-class features befitting of this classic.P.S.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3QNQQKJTL76H0	buru buru piggu	"Fans of Disney animation should be very happy to see Snow White finally arriving on Blu-ray. Widely derided as ""Disney's Folly"" by journalists and industry insiders of the time for its long and costly development cycle ($1.4 million was a staggering sum in 1930's Depression-era America), Snow White was Disney's first feature-length animated film and nearly bankrupted the studio. Walt's determination won out and Disney went on to build the entertainment empire that we know today. Now, old meets new as this cherished classic comes to hi-def with a sparkling new transfer. Newly remastered and digitally restored, this ""Diamond Edition"" looks and sounds fantastic, having been given all the care and attention that a film of this cultural and historical significance deserves (it was added to the National Film Registry for preservation by the Library of Congress in 1989). Snow White is notable for a number of cinematic firsts and technological innovations which set the standard for the animation industry (discussed in the special features).For $20, this is a great value, and there is plenty on this 3-disc set for young or old to enjoy. The first disc contains the movie, audio commentary culled from Walt Disney's interviews interspersed with comments by film historian, some interactive games, and 2 deleted scenes. The second disc is a vast collection of archival footage, photos, and history, all in HD. The third disc is the DVD edition, for viewing where Blu-ray isn't available. This item is identical toSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (DVD/Two-Disc Blu-ray + BD Live w/DVD packaging), except that one has Snow White on the cover art and a black DVD case. The Blu-ray edition has the evil queen/hag and a standard translucent blue Blu-ray case.First, the picture quality: Disney has done a stellar job restoring this 72 year old masterpiece and given the film plenty of breathing room with a 50GB disc. There is not a hint of discoloration, fading, frame jitter, darkening, or yellowing throughout the film. According to the DVD insert, 360,000 frames of negative were scanned and digitally restored in a year-long process. This TLC is evident from the first few seconds of starting the film. Colors are steady, vibrant and fresh, looking like a painted storybook come to life, as it was originally intended. I did notice some specks and uncaught artifact when I went looking for them by standing right in front of the TV, but under normal viewing conditions from 4-6 feet away on your couch, these are not noticeable. I also did notice some unnatural halo outlining in some scenes, especially near the beginning of the film. A strange fuzz encircled the pigeons in the scene where Snow White is singing at the well. Again, I only noticed these flaws when I scrutinized the video up close. Most people will not notice unless it's pointed out to them.New to this edition is ""DisneyView"", a marketing term for how Disney fills up the black bars around the side of the screen. The original film was 1:33, so watching it on today's wider HDTVs will result in black vertical bars. DisneyView is just simple watercolor backgrounds, like curtains or stone pillars. They change when the scene fades to another scene. I found them distracting and turned them off after a few minutes. It felt like I was being boxed in.Audio: The original mono recording has been re-engineered for 7.1 surround. I only have a 5.1 for testing, and sound is clear and strong, sounding every bit as good as a film that was produced today.Extras: The commentary track from interviews culled from Disney archives is interesting to listen to, although film historian John Canemaker can be a bit dull at times and a bit too academic, dropping too many nerdy name and film references that will escape ordinary viewers. Being the great storyteller that he is, Walt's segments are always a joy to listen to as he talks about various aspects of the production.BD Live took a minute or more to load, but it seemed longer. From previous experience, BD Live is usually the worst part of any Blu-ray  experience. There's a feature called ""Scene Stealer"" where you can upload your face and it'll be superimposed over the scene. It seemed a big hassle to operate and I didn't bother. Similarly, a few games are included that you control with the remote, like an image guessing game called ""What Do You See"", and a jewel matching game, but I'm not a big fan of such features as usually the controls are awkward.Disc 2 contains a whole treasure trove of historical footage, interviews, and images. The content is divided into departments (animation, inking and painting, music, etc), each represented by black and white photography onscreen, with slick fly-throughs linking the rooms all together. There's a lot to see here, although getting around the different departments is a bit cumbersome. Different objects or parts of the room light up when you push the remote control arrows (usually 3 or 4 items per room). Luckily, there is an index link that lists everything (show as a map, with subsections all listed in a column along the right). Here you'll find the famous ""Steamboat Willie"" and a lot of early Disney shorts like ""Skeleton Dance"", ""Flowers and Trees"", ""Goddess of Spring"", ""Playful Pluto"", and several others. Some of the segments are very short, lasting only 1 to 4 minutes. These discuss various aspects of the production process and I would've liked for them to have been longer, but it was a genuine joy to see footage from 1930's America.In summary, this is a set every film and animation lover should own. This is a disc you and your family will enjoy for years to come.  The $20 price tag is very reasonable and you're getting a lot of material here. The second disc alone is about 2.5 hrs of content. I hope Disney continues this level of care and attention to upcoming Blu-ray re-releases of other classics like Dumbo [Blu-ray]."	5.0	Sparkling new restoration + hours of bonus material make this beloved classic a must-own	2009-10-12	2	2	0

This stunning release of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is the THE best DVD package ever assembled.Of course the highlight of this set is the superb new restoration job seen in the print.  This was acheived by taking the original dirt-encrusted nitrate camera negative, cleaning each frame individually and then transferring it to High-Definition video.  It is even better than the 1993 restoration and subsequent 1994 video release.The actual movie is spectacular in itself, but the experience does not end there. The Magic Mirror and Angela Lansbury act as your guides for Disc 1, while the Mirror guides you through a world of extras in Disc 2. Very exiting, it makes you feel like you are there. No wonder Buena Vista are calling this a &quot;totally-immersive DVD experience&quot;.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2FPDWTD9AENVK	Carl Manes	When it is found that the evil Queen is no longer the fairest in the land, the beautiful princess Snow White is forced from the kingdom and left to seek refuge in the woodland home of The Seven Dwarfs. She cooks and cleans for the rambunctious bunch, but it is not long before the Queen learns of her whereabouts and attempts to seal her in an eternal slumber using a poisoned apple. SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is a cinematic milestone, marking not only the first of Walt Disney's many feature-length animations, but also the first color feature and the first feature to use cel-animation. In animation, the difference is in the detail, and few films are more finely decorated or colorfully composed. SNOW WHITE may be filled with pleasant songs and cheery forest critters, but it also falls back on many of the darker story elements that have been taken from the Brothers Grimm. Here we have a children's story where an evil queen asks her servant to kill the princess and cut out her heart! Disney does nothing to censor the violence and terror in SNOW WHITE, though a note of German Expressionist influence can be seen through the use of light and shadow to imply many of the horrible acts. Walt Disney's initial foray into feature film is groundbreaking for establishing its many firsts, but it has become a screen classic thanks to its timeless tale and immaculate production.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies	5.0	ILHM Reviews: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs	2013-02-03	0	0	0

""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" which is referred to as ""the one that started it all,"" is finally available in a sensational Blue Ray / DVD set that shall please both fans and collectors alike. And it has to be this way, because this film was Walt Disney's first animated feature, which has deservedly survived the test of time. Furthermore, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is being released as part of the all-new Diamond Collection, which includes the best quality possible in high definition picture, sound, extras, and much more.""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" possibly began the ""good versus evil"" trend in Disney's movies. It is about a beautiful, good-hearted princess that has the misfortune of being hated by her stepmother, because her mirror informs her that Snow White is the fairest and most beautiful of them all. Of course, her stepmother can not stand competition and rapidly orders a servant to go to the forest with Snow White, and kill her there. Luckily, the servant is incapable of following these horrible orders, and sets Snow White free.While lost in the forest, Snow White finds a small house, which was apparently inhabited by seven little persons. They turn out to be the seven dwarfs - Doc, Dopey, Sleepy, Bashful, Grumpy, Happy, Sneezy --, who eventually befriend her. However the mirror on the wall informs the stepmother that Snow White is still alive, which infuriates her. She finds a way to locate Snow White and poisons her. As we know, only the kiss of a prince will awaken her.""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is a treasure that shall be transferred from generation to generation, and the new edition is the perfect vehicle for that. In addition of including the film in both Blue Ray and DVD formats, this fantastic set also features a second Blue Ray disc loaded with extras, such as ""Hyperion Studios,"" a digital look at the place where Snow White was originally created in the 1930s; ""About Toby Bluth,"" the artist that created DisneyView art, which is featured in this edition of the movie; ""What do You see?,"" and, believe me, much, much more. A must for everybody!  Released October 6, 2009. (USA, 1937, color, 84 min plus additional material).

Any fan of Disney, or animated movies in general, will see this as a required addition to their libraries.The almost limitless 'immersive' DVD features will take months to watch and allow people a rare look into the creative process of mounting such a technically challenging project (the first of its kind) as this.The film itself looks flawless, no speck, no grain, no fading, the colors just as bright and vibrant today as they were in 1937.  It is a mint condition presentation of a platinum standard film that set the mold.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AP7N0KHWFC9UT	Chickie	I hadn't seen Snow White since the 1983 theatrical re-release...went as a kid with my grandparents and loved it...that alone made me really misty. My older daughter (3) is a carbon copy of Snow White, so I was eager to have her see the movie. She's now begging to watch Snow White instead of Ariel and Cinderella (love them too, but there's nothing like Snow White). I really choked up when she told me how beautiful she was. I opted to wait for this re-release (vs buy a used version of the prev Platinum edition). I am so glad I bought the Diamond Edition Blu-Ray - the picture quality is stunning and the sound is so crisp and clear. It also gives you viewing options- while watching it in the original 1937 format is great- I  really like the DisneyVision with the paintings filling in the black spaces. The side paintings of the velvet red theater curtains on our big screen really made it feel like our own little movie theater. While previous platinum edition Disney movies are excellent (and we have quite a few)- the picture and sound of this one is definitely superior. Total Thumbs Up!!!****2 notes- 1) for whatever reason, Amazon is lumping in reviews for the prev. released platinum edition of this movie (vs the current diamond ed.). Sure, it's the same movie, but the diamond edition wasnt released until Oct 2009- so if you're trying to decide about the diamond edition BluRay- ignore all comments prior to this Oct 2009 release date 2) I've seen a number of reviews bashing the storyline. It's a fairytale and unless you've been hiding under a rock- you know the basic story and variations. i.e. I know the story of Rapunzel, but if Disney were to make an animated feature of it- it would be insane to bash it for having a predictable story. That's just how animated features of long standing fairy tales work!	5.0	Beautiful!!! Brought tears to my eyes!	2009-10-14	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3N8RZSXKN1OR2	Chrijeff	"When you look at this movie with the 20/20 benefit of 80 or so years of hindsight, you see that Disney and his people were actually setting up the parameters for a whole new kind of film, and establishing certain givens that would endure through most of their classic animated features: a beautiful young heroine (who isn't *entirely* helpless), animals both friendly and sinister, thrills, scary bits, humor, magic, music, and romance.  They also expand upon the original (in this case a story from Grimms' fairy tales) to make the story more compehensible and the characters people we can better relate to.  Snow White (voiced by Adriana Caselotti, the 21-year-old daughter of an operatic family) is a young princess forced by her vain stepmother the Queen (Lucille La Verne) to dress in rags and work as a scullery maid (presumably her father is dead, though we're never definitely told, and the Queen simply seized the throne as Regent and hung onto it).  When the Queen's Magic Mirror informs her that Snow White can now be reckoned ""fairest of them all,"" she plots to have the girl murdered, but her huntsman (Stuart Buchanan) can't go through with the deed and urges her to run away and hide in the forest.  With the help of the small animals she befriends, she finds the house of the Seven Dwarfs, wins their hearts, and is then found and pursued by the Queen in the guise of a ""harmless old beggar woman,"" with poison apple at hand.In today's liberated climate, some viewers may censure Snow for her panicked flight into the deep woods, but it's worth asking yourself if *you* wouldn't panic too if someone had just come after you with a Bowie knife!  And although Snow dreams of the day ""my prince will come"" and take her away, she's still a hard, uncomplaining worker who cheerfully resigns herself to the Queen's tyrannies and makes the most of her situation--which, of course, enables her to make a place for herself in the Dwarves' home.  But the best parts of the movie aren't even about her: they focus on things like the friendly animals (watch for the raccoons helping to do the Dwarves' laundry, or the buck who helps pull an ore-cart at their diamond mine), the magic, and the music (anyone who doesn't want to get up and dance during the Dwarves' Yodel Song is seriously in need of an attitude adjustment!).  And, of course, the Dwarves themselves, each a distinct individual (I suspect that a great many of us like Grumpy the best!).

And as her loving father, I have watched SNOW WHITE with her now countless times. Back when I was single, I found SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (dwarves?), to be boring and weak on story. But now seeing it through my daughter's eyes, seeing her pure glee as Snow White befriends and sings and dances with the little people... it's all extremely charming and heart warming.But here's what I don't understand. The Evil Queen is the ""fairest one of them all"" for quite a while, until Snow White suddenly wakes up one morning (puberty completes?) and is declared by the Magic Mirror to be the fairest one in the land. So now the Evil Queen is the SECOND fairest one of all. Not such a bad thing to be, really, particularly given her age. But she gets so enraged by being bumped down to the second slot that death to her own step-daughter appears to be the only reasonable answer.After the Huntsman warns Snow White and lets her escape (as opposed to taking advantage of the ""fairest one"" and then killing her with the Queen's permission), the Queen decides she's going to take care of her herself. And how does she do it? The Queen opens her huge spellbook and CHANGES HER APPEARANCE into that of an old beggar woman. Why not just change your appearance back again to become the fairest of them all?!? Why does regaining the title of the fairest cause her to instead change into a wretchedly ugly beast? That seems like poor planning.Or why not just let Snow White run off with that Prince at the very start (she watches them from the window)? Then Snow White would be out of the Queen's hair and she'd again be fairest.Cartoons are so hard!"	3.0	I have questions!	2001-12-27	8	2	6

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2NX99GVAX4TRP	"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover"""	"Snow White was the first American full-length animated feature.  Many consider it Walt Disney's masterpiece.  As it was being made from at least 1934 through 1937 many industry movers and shakers thought Wal t Disney had lost his mind, spending so much time, energy and effort on producing something as utterly ridiculous as a feature length cartoon feature.  Disney was crazy as a fox.  He established the foundation of the Disney formula and established his studio as the one to reckon with when it came to animated features.Keeping things simple and glossing over the most gruesome aspects of the Brothers Grimm classic fairy tale, Walt Disney and company created a squeaky clean protagonist, a hiss-able antagonist and several love-able and humorous characters with names that are still the subject of formal and informal trivia contests around the world.  The film offers several memorable and now classic sequences such as when Snow White flees into the forest or  the Queen transformation scenes.  There are also those memorable songs: ""Heigh Ho"", ""Whistle While You Work"" and the operetta styled ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"".Technically Snow White represented a huge achievement for Walt Disney in several ways.  The detailed character animation complete with very good lip synching, and beautifully drawn background settings including shadows and water reflections were the finest American audiences had ever seen on the screen.Regardless of whether this is your all-time favorite Disney feature or not--the DVD is nothing short of a stunning package that should be considered by anyone and everyone who has any interest in this film whatsoever.The quality of the image and sound is superb.  There's some artifacting present in the very beginning of the film (during it's story-book opening) but then finding any flaws in the presentation becomes quite a challenge.  A few sequences are a bit too dark perhaps.  The best quality prints were obtained, assembled and then given a full spare no expense clean up before being almost flawlessly digitally transferred to disc.  The sound was reproduced and then digitally enhanced and re-mixed.  It is remarkable what has been done with what was one a mono audio track and now takes full advantage of  the capabilities of a multi-speaker home theater system.  Much of the original audio track was recorded in 1935 !  And sure you can hear some crackles and hisses and pops, but the clarity and fullness that has been achieved will knock your socks off.The supplemental material presented on this 2 DVD set is everything you could have ever hoped for.  From a lengthy newly created making of documentary hosted by Angela Landsbury  to some truly stunning archival footage that includes deleted scenes, incomplete and abandoned sequences and more.  Publicity material, footage from the premiere, and even a silly DVD game is included in the package.You also get, now get this, what amounts to audio commentary from Walt Disney himself integrated into the feature length commentary of the film.Is it really worth buying this DVD?  If you have any interest in the film at all, this is a DVD that you must have in your collection.  Disney is hyping this one pretty heavily and declaring it the finest DVD ever produced.  They are probably absolutely correct.  This DVD package has so much packed it into, you might say that even the bells and whistles have bells and whistles.  Not all the supplemental material is priceless or essential to be sure, but a lot of it is and the additional stuff isn't here at the expense of including something else.  They have opened up the archives, dug deep into the vaults and created a package to satisfy the most insatiable Snow White buff amongst us.  You better believe there's a little to much of the sugar-coated Disney Studios as the KING OF THE ANIMATION WORLD type stuff--but you've been living in a cave for the last 20 years if you didn't expect it.Bottom line: Technically this DVD is a beauty and there are hours of supplemental material to please film, animation, and Disney buffs.  Some of the supplemental material will also drive animation afficianados crazy--but you already knew it would.Christopher Jarmick,is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2Y9M8EXP74GS7	"Chua Yi Fen ""HP"""	Highly recommended for fans of Disney's Snow White. I got this side primarily because of the bonus contents - book and pin set and the beautifully designed box. The box is cardboard and the richness of the feel is from the printed velvet-like fabric that was attached over the box. It would have been better if this is actually wood. On the other hand, the effect may not be as nice as a velvet feel.Unfortunately, i would give it less than 5 points because the inner platform was torn in area. I do not think that this is a result of shipping. I think this is more a result of careless packaging when in the factory since the external wrapping are all in stellar condition. It is sad, a blight on a otherwise good product.If the inner platform have used the same cardboard/velvet combination, i suppose this may be avoided	4.0	Excellent product but points off for damages done to packaging	2010-01-10	1	0	1

Jones	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Diamond Edition is truly a classic dvd with the added value of modern technology.  My 4-year old son was so excited when I received this dvd and viewed this movie for the first time along with me. I knew I would love it, because I had seen this movie before but was so happy to see that my son absolutely loved it as well.  I have always loved this movie but the added bonus of the Diamond Edition makes this version well worth it.  It includes the 1 disc dvd and the 2 disc Blu Ray so you can play it on your blu ray player or dvd player. The picture quality and color is amazing and the high definition sound is the best quality.  The Blu Ray discs also offer games like unscramble the scrambled image, which princess are you like, and a matching game that the whole family can enjoy together.  It also contains a music video and a sing-a-long that my son just loves.  Backstage disney gives us a glimpse into Disney's original studio,  some of the original storyboards, and much more.  This is a great value for a timeless classic movie that my whole family really loves.  I was pleasantly surprised what a difference this version was over my previously owned Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  I cannot say enough good things about the Diamond Edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.	5.0	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Diamond Edition	2009-10-19	0	0	0

Has a new generation enjoying the magic that Disney brings us.  Snow White is a truly magnificent movie and deserves to have its time in the spotlight. I am glad that Disney has produced this DVD and with ALL of the extras adults are in for a new treat.  The picture gallary art is great.  There are so many extras on the second disc it unrealtistic.Most people know the storyline of Snow White...

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	Nobody did animated features back in the 20's and 30's. The only one doing animation was some small companies and Disney, who were mainly making shorts. Walt had the idea of creating a full length feature. And while I do have some issues with the film, it's definately worth your time.The Queen is a very vain woman who can't stand anyone being more beautiful than her. There is one rival though: Snow White. The Queen sends a hunter to kill her but he spares her life and she runs off. She ends up finding an old empty cottage and cleans it and passes out. Meanwhile, 7 dwarves with distinctive personalities come home and find their house clean. Eventually, they become a big family and have fun but the Queen finds out she lives and so she poisons an apple that puts all who take a bite into a coma. The dwarves have to come and save the day.It's a great film full of memorable images, characters and music. However I thought it felt kinda long. When the dwarves come home, they took quite awhile before they actually find Snow White. I guess it's kind of the rookie feeling I have with the film. Disney hadn't really mastered having a long running time yet which they would greatly improve on. There is a wealth of extras also and they did a superb job restoring the film has there was a bit of color fading and scratches in the print.If you're at all into disney, I would definately suggest picking this up.	4.0	The very first animated feature is worth your time	2004-09-20	4	2	2

It's pretty sharp and up to the Disney Blu-Ray standards. It makes a great movie all the more great. Not only is the picture improved, but so is the sound, and so is the regular DVD.....so you get a lot of bang for your buck here.The story is ""cute"" because of the seven dwarfs.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"It is probably pointless to review the film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  People with much more experience, knowledge, and writing skills have waxed rhapsodic about the importance and enjoyability of this film.  I will mention the endorsement of my 2-year-old son, however: this is the only ""Princess"" film he has ever asked to see.  Granted, he often picks ""Cars"" over Snow White, but he certainly asks for Snow White a lot.No, readers of this review are likely more interested in the various formats and qualities thereof.  Here I can offer some insight.  This 3-disc Blu-ray edition comes with a DVD copy of the film (which includes some extras not on the Blu-ray copy, so make sure you watch them both).  I've had no problems with this disc, and it looks and sounds just as good on my TV as the Blu-ray copy (42"", same sound system).  The Blu-ray copy of the film also worked fine, but has the same annoying problems that Sleeping Beauty had: if you stop the disc, you cannot restart from where you left off, but are instead subjected to the FBI warnings, Disney propoganda, and menu navigation to get back to where you left off.  When you have small children, they are not going to watch the film all the way through every time!  And they are going to play with the remote control, etc.  This is incredibly frustrating and is not a function of Blu-ray discs in general: my Simpsons Movie Blu-ray, for example, acts like a DVD when stopped and restarted.The third disc contains extras.  The extras are fantastic.  No, better than that: they are FANTASTIC!!!  The highlights include an audio commentary by Walt Himself pieced together from audio recordings made in the late 1930s.  There are also lots of interviews and short video clips of other workers, including video of the director(s) setting up the multi-plane cameras, sound engineers discussing the relative merits of the echos in the men's vs. the women's bathrooms, and a promo film on Disneyland.  But best of all, there are included many of Disney's short films, most of which I hadn't seen before.  There's ""Steamboat Willy"" of course (the first Disney film to sync animation with sound), ""The Old Mill"" (first use of the multiplane camera), Flowers and Trees (first Technicolour cartoon and winner of an Oscar), Goddess of Spring (Persephone is often considered Disney's first attempt at a ""realistic"" human female character), and several others.  These shorts, and the technical introductions related to them, are themselves worth the price of the disc.Unfortunately.... Disney's Blu-rays are almost too annoying to actually watch.  As mentioned above, pressing stop (or turning off the power on your player) automatically resets the disc to the beginning.  I have a PS3 player, with load times on the order of seconds (5 or 6 at most).  So it was with some annoyance that I pressed stop and then timed how long it would take to get back to where I was in the disc.  The total time: 2 minutes and 33 seconds.  This is not straight running time either - I stood in front of the machine pressing the ""Menu"" and ""Fast Forward"" buttons on the remote whenever I had the chance.  Two and a half minutes to resume a film after just pressing ""Stop"" to go to the bathroom is unacceptable.  Having to watch the FBI warnings and Disney ads AGAIN is unacceptable.  Is Disney trying to drive people to piracy?  Because that is the effect that technical issues like this will create.  Memo to Disney: do not punish the people who are trying to be honest and actually buy your movies.  (And I didn't even mention the fact that I had to update my software before it would even let me watch the thing in the first place!  Aanother hour down the drain...at least I didn't have the kids crying because they couldn't start watching it right away.)"	3.0	Good movie, FANTASTIC EXTRAS, Blu-ray technical issues very annoying	2010-03-24	2	2	0

It won't play on my computer.  I'd never had a new disk that wouldn't play so I complained to Amazon.  Amazon sent my complaint to Neomark.  I didn't hear from the company.  A few weeks later I again complained to Amazon.  Again Amazon referred my complaint to Neomark.  Again no response.  So I complained again to Amazon.  Amazon essentially stated that the problem is not theirs but is between me and Neomark.  Obviously, I am disappointed with Amazon for not backing up a product sold through its website.  As for Neomark, if the company even exists on planet Earth, I will never again buy another product from them.  So I'm stuck with a bad disk that I have no choice but to trash.  Now, I will always avoid buying products from outside sellers through Amazon.  I could get burned again anytime.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3I7CRNHGZVWXP	Daisy Ghostly	Forget new-Disney, this is the real thing. I just love oldfashioned animation, oddly enough I find it more &quot;alive&quot; than the clean and sterile animation of today. Actually, animation hasn't been very interesting to me for many years now, I'm not quite sure when I lost interest but I definitely prefer the very old stuff. I love old cartoons (vintage Tom &amp; Jerry, etc.), and loathe the new cold ones. (Besides, I'm actually more into stop motion animation anyway.) This 2-disc DVD is an absolute must if you're a fan of this movie, and if you don't like this movie you're not an animation fan. Period. The movie is a true classic with a lot of memorable scenes, done the lively way I want my cartoons, oops, animation to look. This is one of the best special edition DVDs I've ever seen, packed with a million goodies too many to mention here. The animated menus are also wonderful, and I bet there must be a few Easter Eggs hidden here and there on these two discs. The one thing I could've done without though, is the Barbra Streisand song presented with clips from the movie in music video style. -The Disney studio seem proud of it, but I see it as an obvious attempt to modernize the movie. This movie needs no updating, and you can always skip the chapter of course. &quot;Snow White&quot; hasn't dated in the least, it's looking more fresh than ever. Forever. P.S., think of the protests if this was a new film; I mean, a young woman living with seven dwarfs !?. Scandalous !.	5.0	Pure magic	2001-10-27	2	2	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AYTTBFL34EVAD	"D. Allen ""meeko_2003"""	Walt Disney's first feature length animated film is just as much of a classic today as it was when it first premiered in 1937. The story of the beautiful princess taken in by seven kindly dwarfs in order to protect her from her evil stepmother, the Queen, is a magical adventure that unfolds almost as if it is a fairytale book that has come to life (which, in a way, it is). The memorable characters and songs are sure to make this a favorite of every member of the family. The DVD complements the enchanting film with a virtual journey into Snow White's World guided by the magic mirror which is found on disk two. This includes interactive environments, galleries of artwork, and extras such as deleted scenes, rejected concepts, and vintage audio and films which any Disney fan or film historian will find fascinating.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A14IY5HCINZWT0	Damien D. Mecoles	"This film is the first in a series of animated films by Walt Disney studios.  At the time it was groundbreaking in that no feature length fully animated sound cartoon had been made at that point.  Its framework, a strong but simple plot mixed with songs, humour and adventure was kept intact for many decades. The animation is fantastic for its time.  Snow White in some ways can be seen as an extended Silly Symphony, those series of Disney cartoon shorts that allowed Walt to experiment with realistic animation, technological breakthroughs and character development.  Snow White blew people away when it was first shown.  Remember, we're talking about the mid/late 30's.  Porky pig was a new character for Warner Bros.  Woody Woodpecker and Bugs Bunny were yet to be.  Krazy Kat and Farmer Alfalfa were ""entertaining"" fans of Columbia and Terrytoons.  Once Snow White came to town, followed closely by Pinnochio, all the studios were forced to improve the quality of their cartoons simply because the public expected more.  If it wasn't for Walt Disney taking the financial risks to take animation to its highest level one wonders if cartoons would even have made it to the 21st Century.  Chuck Jones's early films were Disneyesque until he found a new direction.  Tex Avery took perverse joy at MGM by sending up Disney cartoons, but he did it with great animation and lavish technicolor.  In short, Snow White is the true beginning of the Animation Golden Age."	5.0	Snow White the First	2007-09-27	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1OM5269E8J401	"Darryl M. Haase ""dothehucklebuck"""	&quot;Snow White&quot; is a gem on DVD, and is a classic for all time. Not only did this film influence every future animated short and feature film, it also was directly responsible for MGM bringing &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; to the screen. All the computer animated wizardry in the world cannot replicate the charm and craftmanship of the detailed animation in this film. Its only weakness is that some of the comedic antics of the dwarfs simply go on for too long. Yet that's a minor complaint about a lush and enjoyable film such as this. Don't think the Wicked Queen isn't scary to young kids- SHE IS (just ask my four-year old niece). Also, I have to say that &quot;Snow White&quot; is more of a liberated heroine than she is given credit for. She uses charm, friendship and negotiation to set up refuge in the dwarf's cottage, yet is old-fashioned enough to still want romance. Too many of Disney's modern animated heroines are just too abrasive for their own good (I know this is not politically correct, but so what?) The DVD transfer is great, but why do we have to wait through endless commercials when we play the disc again, as well as having to sit through the Magic Mirror menu over and over? A small price to pay for such a great product, but still a price!	5.0	&quot;SNOW WHITE&quot; IS DISNEY'S BEST ANIMATED FAIRY TALE	2001-12-20	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A8S11VP9Z36D6	"Dave ""Davelandweb"""	"Disney has definitely been at the forefront of Blu-ray releases, and ""Snow White"" is no exception.When I popped the disc into my Blu-ray player and the movie began, I was impressed by the bright colors and the level of detail, but I also noticed some slight digital artifacting. I have to admit I was a little surprised. The soundtrack was amazingly clean...the best I had ever heard in its many incarnations. After watching for a bit, I was looking through the packaging and realized I was watching the DVD copy, not the Blu-ray. Folks, let me tell you...when I put the Blu-ray disc in, I was blown away. It was sheer perfection. It was as if I was looking at the actual painted backgrounds and cels. And the soundtrack...clear as a bell. Just absolutely amazing. To see the transformation of the Evil Queen into the Old Crone bears repeated viewings...it looks that good! Disney has also provided an alternate means to watching ""Snow White."" Since it was originally filmed in the 1.33:1 format, those with widescreen TV's will have black bars on the left and the right. By choosing the Disney view option, the art of Disney artist Toby Bluth subtly frames the movie, acting almost as an artistic movie theater curtain. This definitely does not detract from the film at all, and because Toby has matched the style of the movie, it can truly enhance watching ""Snow White"" again and again.Plenty of other extras, too. However, those with the previous special edition of ""Snow White"" will want to retain them as this set does not repeat them. Mercifully, Barbra Streisand's version of ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" has been left off, too (sorry Streisand fans...I am not one of you). The extras that are on this set include:Snow White Returns - Newly discovered storyboards suggest a brand new Snow White featurette that never got made. For the first time, current Disney animators show how this short story would have played. This always blows me away; the amount of well-preserved vintage memorabilia and historical information that Disney has preserved. This never-made featurette was most likely and excuse to use two sequences deleted from the original film, but it is still fun to see the possibilities of more from the dwarfs.The One That Started It All - It is hard to imagine in this digital age, but back in 1937, Snow White really revolutized the world of animation. This featurette helps place everything in context.Hyperion Studios - Audiences are digitally transported to 1937 to discover first-hand the Hyperion Studios, the original studio Walt Disney built where Snow White was created. Viewers will be able to ""walk"" (virtually, of course!) the halls of this historic landmark. This amazing ""Backstage Disney"" feature contains newly dimensionalized archival photos, never-before-heard animator recordings, archival transcripts and rare footage of Walt himself revealing how Disney's gifted filmmakers crafted the very first animated feature.And not to get mired in the past, this Blu-ray also includes a sneak preview of the first 6 minutes of ""The Princess and the Frog,"" Disney's return to hand-drawn animation, to be released in a few months. And yes, it appears to live up to the hype!Overall: GET THIS SET! Even if you have previous editions, the upgrade in picture, sound, and extras is worth it."	5.0	Image will blow you away on Blu-ray	2009-10-07	6	5	1
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	"""Snow White And the Seven Dwarves"" is a great animated fairy tale released in 1937.  Its theme has since passed the test of time.  The unforgettable charming plot remains frequently viewed by many audiences today.  It takes audiences through a tale of Snow White struggling to find Prince Charming.  Through life obstacles, namely the Wicked Witch, she finds seven dwarves whom she helps and help her.  This series of events, with others, keeps audiences interested in every scene.  The individual character personalities give this fairy tale a great name.  Through these events, the songs blend wonderfully with the individual scenes.  They offer the added entertainment pleasure that spices up the film events.  The voices add such delight to this film through the script and the singing.  The sounds add a beautiful element to the charming theme.  ""Snow White And the Seven Dwarves"" proves why it's become a classic film.  This is great for all ages to enjoy."	5.0	Magical Fairy Tale	2004-10-19	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1CK4J7YRAUQ53	"David Foughty ""DLF"""	"There isn't much that hasn't already been said about ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", Walt Disney's first feature length animated film. Suffice it to say that it not only fulfilled the studio's hopes beyond their wildest dreams, it made possible the Disney films that followed it. From the famous Grimm fairy tale about a beautiful princess who flees her jealous stepmother and finds refuge with seven friendly dwarfs, Walt Disney created a cinematic milestone. At the time the film was in production until the day it was released, rival producers were referring to it as ""Disney's Folly"". The sneering stopped when it was embraced both by critics and audiences, grossing many times it's then record (for an animated film) $1.5 million budget. Eight successful reissues have kept the movie in the public consciousness now for over six decades, during which time the field of animation has grown by leaps and bounds. Still. despite the cinematic advances and the passage of time, ""Snow White"" stands alone. While the classic story is but a framework for the film (a fact which troubled me for years), ""Snow White"" can be fully enjoyed for the pioneer it truly is.Along with a splendid cast of voices headed by Adriana Caselotti (Snow White) Harry Stockwell (father of Guy and Dean, as the Prince) and Lucille La Verne (The Queen), there are songs which can truly be called timeless: ""Whistle While You Work"", ""Heigh Ho"", ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"", etc.). Much time and effort went toward developing the characters of the Seven Dwarfs and giving each a distinct personality (absent in the original story) which went a long way in making audiences care for Snow White's plight. Interestingly enough, although the fairy tale was toned down considerably to make it more ""family friendly"", the overzealous way in which the film makers transformed the Wicked Queen into a hideous hag at the climax was the subject of an incredible amount of controversy at the time. In fact, it was under a partial ban in England which made it off-limits to children under 16 years of age! Nevertheless, it was the recipient of a special Academy Award in 1938.To go on about the impact made by the film would be redundant. It simply must be seen to be appreciated. In 2001, it was released on DVD as the first of Disney's ""Diamond Editions"". And many months before it was in stores, there was great speculation about the content. All the anticipation was justified when the DVD hit the stores. Critics and consumers were overwhelmed (just like the audiences back in 1937) with both the content and the painstaking restoration (beyond that done for it's 60th anniversary reissue) and made it THE Bluray for the subsequent holiday season. Without going into detail, it looks as if it were made yesterday, and sounds better than a film of this vintage could ever be expected to. But the streamlining has not diminished it's charm--only accentuated it. And when you think (before you are drawn into the story, and you ARE) that ""Snow White"", unlike today's computer-drawn animated features was entirely done by hand, that makes it even more of a miracle. Instead of listing the already well publicized bonus features, let me say that this ""Platinum Edition"" is like a self-contained history of the film, with hours worth of delights the most astounding being a pieced-together commentary by Walt Disney himself. Out of print for years, it is well worth the effort and expense to find. And although Disney made it a point to announce that they planned to go even further with their subsequent ""Diamond Editions"", Next up Beauty And The Beast October 5th!!"	5.0	One Of The Best Disney Movies Ever!!	2010-04-02	2	2	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3G3O4VG6O2S1Z	David Vaughn	"This is the time-honored story of a princess (voiced by Adriana Caselotti) whose blossoming beauty disturbs her insecure stepmother, the Queen (Lucille La Verne). Each day, the Queen asks a mysterious magic mirror (Moroni Olsen) the question: ""Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?"" For years, the mirror answers the Queen's name, but when it suddenly says Snow White, the evil woman begins her quest to kill the young girl so she may once again be the fairest of them all.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has the distinction of being the first full-length animated feature in movie history, which was a major milestone in 1937, and its success allowed Walt Disney to build an empire. Regrettably, I think it's a bore. From a technical perspective, I have to hand it to Disney for creating a masterpiece, but its glacial pacing puts me to sleep every time. In fact, from the time I was seven years old, I've referred to the film as ""Snore White.""Dubbed by Disney as the first title in its ""Diamond Collection,"" Snow White certainly impresses in 1080p with a fantastic AVC encode. Colors are very strong, particularly the blue and red in Snow White's dress, and black levels are inky and deep. Contrast wavers occasionally, which may be a result of the animated cells themselves, but the intricate details are mesmerizing, especially in the characters' facial expressions and the textures in the background.The DTS-HD MA 7.1 soundtrack captures the essence of the original mono track. Dialog is clear and intelligible, although the shrill voice of Snow White can be excruciating, especially when she hits a high note. Surprisingly, the LFE channel packs some punch, especially during the rain storm, and the musical numbers have never sounded better. The surround speakers provide suitable ambience, and the occasional discrete effect and the pans around the room are smooth and natural.Disney treats the cinematic masterpiece with a new twist on retail offerings. There are two three-disc sets available, one with DVD packaging and the other in a Blu-ray case, but each includes the same three discs--two Blu-rays and a DVD copy of the feature film. The first Blu-ray disc offers the movie with an optional commentary from film historian John Canemaker; the remainder of the supplements are on disc two. The DVD has the same commentary as well as an all-new music video from Tiffany Thornton and a sneak peak at The Princess and the Frog (also on the Blu-ray).The Blu-ray supplements includes ""Hyperion Studios,"" in which users are digitally transported to 1937 to learn firsthand where Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was conceived. With 13 rooms to choose from, this interactive feature contains archival photos, never-before-heard animator recordings, archival transcripts, and rare footage of Walt Disney and his animators. Other supplements include newly found storyboards, which hint that Disney considered a sequel to the film, some games, and a retrospective featurette entitled ""The One That Started It All,"" which explains the historical significance of Snow White.I realize I'm in the minority with my feelings about the film, but even with its short 84-minute runtime, it drags too much. Still, considering when it was made, it certainly deserves praise as a pioneering film, and it looks outstanding on Blu-ray. Recommended for fans.[...]"	4.0	Snow White Blu-ray	2009-10-08	2	2	0

Firstly, the transfer of this film is simply gorgeous. I bought the DVD back in 2001, but this is the closest I've come to the experience of seeing it at the movies. Obviously it won't look like ""WALL-E"" or even ""Sleeping Beauty"", but you're getting the most faithful presentation imaginable for a home format.Furthermore, the extras are plentiful. Story meeting recreations, concept art, featurettes, abandoned concepts... it's all here, as well as some relevant pre-""Snow White"" Silly Symphonies. I'm not a fan of the ""Hyperion Studios"" interactive VR-style menu format, but I feel ungrateful even raising such a complaint against so generous a package.Do you enjoy great craftsmanship?

For this classic film from 1937 to look so vibrant, so spectacular, so beautiful 72 years later is a testament towards Disney's restoration and remastering.  The picture quality is absolutely pristine.  The new lossless  7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is magnificent.  ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition"" is highly recommended!For Walt Disney, seeing a play back in 1916 of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" based on the fairty tale by the Brothers Grimm definitely made the producer to attempt something that has never been done before and that is to create a full-length color animated film.Known for their ""Silly Symphony"" animated shorts, the 1937 animated film definitely silenced anyone who thought that Disney was not able to pull off a full-length animated feature.  Even Walt Disney's wife thought that no one would want to watch a film that starred dwarfs but needless to say, the film that was called ""Disney's Folly"" by naysayers would receive critical praise and even demand by fans for a sequel.  The film would be not only be a classic animated film which was honored by the American Film Institute as the ""Greatest Animation of All Time"".  Even today, adjusted by inflation, the film is considered one of the top 10 money making films in America of all time.In 2001, when the ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was released on DVD, the DVD was one of the films that were known for its innovation, winning a ""Video Premiere Award"" for ""Best Overall New Extra Features"" and nominated for ""Best DVD Menu Design"" and ""Best New, Enhanced or Reconstructed Movie Scenes"".But now in 2009, the film makes its High Definition entry on Blu-ray with 1080p High Definition picture quality and 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound.  Also, a Disney Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack (two Blu-ray discs and a DVD version of the film) which comes out on October 6,  seven weeks before its Deluxe Two-Disc Classic standard definition DVD which will be released on Nov. 24th.  It's also important to note that a limited edition collector's set will also be availableVIDEO & AUDIO:""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" gets its 1080p High Definition transfer and its absolutely beautiful.  Viewers can choose to watch the film in its original 4:3 (1:33:1)  format and watch it  with DisneyView featuring Tony Bluth's artwork on the side (for those who have widescreen televisions).  According to the guide included with this release, restoration experts took full advantage of the newest breakthroughs of digital imaging technologies to produce this classic.  The process took nearly a year of cleanup and scanning over 350,000 frames of the original 75-year-old negative.  And the digital artists then removed dust and scratches from the cels.The picture quality is absolutely beautiful for a film that is 72-years old.  The restoration and remastering has removed all dust and scratches.  I don't think I've seen any blemishes on video.  The picture quality is absolutely beautiful as art backgrounds just look absolutely divine. I don't think I have realized how exquisite the backgrounds were, especially the amount of emotion that went into the animation.  Picture quality for ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition"" is definitely magnificent and I look forward to seeing Disney continue this trend of remastering their classic animated films.  As for DisneyView, similar to ""Pinocchio"", Toby Bluth's painted borders that are on the sides of the animation matches the animation quite fine and was definitely my preference over standard black bars.As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is featured in an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.Audio is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), the original mono presentation and also French and Spanish 5.1 DEHT restored original theatrical soundtrack.  The film is dialogue and music driven with the soundtrack being front and center channel driven.  Music is also featured during the surround and rear surround channels as well.  Dialogue and music is crystal clear and understandable.  During the more emotional sequences, such as Snow White running away from home in the forest, definitely makes the room quite immersive, albeit a short while but overall, a good use of utilizing the music of Snow White through all channels.  There are other parts that really come through on all channels such as a shriek by Snow White coming clear from the rear surrounds which was quite nice (and surprising).  Overall, a solid lossless audio soundtrack for a 72-year old animated film.As for the audio of the accompanying DVD, the DVD comes with an English, French and Spanish 5.1 DEHT soundtrack.Subtitles are provided in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition"" is absolutely loaded with special features.

Needless to say, the DVD won several awards for its technology and so, when the announcement came that ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" will receive a Diamond Edition Blu-ray disc release, I was curious to see how Disney could top themselves because that release was already phenomenal.I have since gone through the Blu-ray release and all I can say is...Wow!Disney has not only topped the Platinum Edition release, they have set the bar once again for a Blu-ray release and the amount of content that can be included on a Blu-ray and let alone, how awesome they were able to digitally restore the classic 1937 film.There was no doubt in my mind that Disney would give their first animated feature on Blu-ray the best treatment as possible and as this release is a celebration of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", it's also a celebration of the talent behind the film.  Those who were involved with Hyperion Studios that created the ""Silly Symphonies"" animated shorts back in the early 1930's and using the technology at that time and building it, in order to create their first full feature animated masterpiece.In fact, not only do we get audio of those who worked on the film but we also are treated with those classic animated shorts such as ""Babes in the Woods"", ""The Skeleton Dance"", ""Music Land"", ""Goddess of Spring"", ""Playful Pluto"", ""The Old Mill"", ""Steamboat Willie"" and more.  And to make things even more impressive, these shorts are featured in HD (not cleaned up but still much better than their DVD counterparts). This Blu-ray release manages to capture the various process of the film from creating the story, the music, the art, the backgrounds, the layout, the animation, the live action references, decisions at the sweatbox meetings, ink and paint and how women were involved in the animated process at the time, the camera department, soundstage, etc.So much is included on both Blu-ray discs in terms of special features, so much went into restoring this film, that this release is one, if not the top video releases of all time.  I have no doubt in my mind that probably ten years from now, this Blu-ray will be highly revered for its content.I know that many people own the 2001 Platinum DVD Edition of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and are wondering if it's worth the double dip and the answer is YES!  There is just so much included on the Diamond Edition, way more than the 2001 Platinum Edition.  Also, if you are now wanting these classic Disney films in High Definition, its definitely worth the move to see this classic film in High Definiton.  But I must say that you should not toss away your 2001 DVD edition because there are video clips such as the ""Excerpt from The Story of Silly Symphony"", ""Excerpt from Tricks of Our Trade"", ""Camera Tests"", ""Abandoned Concepts"", vintage audio (radio shows and spots are not included) and several songs and deleted scenes which are not included on this Diamond Edition release.So, overall it's a no-brainer that ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition"" is definitely worth it.  For High Definition fans, the film looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray.  And as mentioned, the sheer amount of content included in this release is absolutely incredible.I really don't have any negatives but me being nitpicky that it would have been nice to have certain special features such as the vintage radio/audio content , a few deleted scenes, songs and video clip excerpts from the 2001 Platinum Edition DVD included on the Diamond Edition.  And personally, for me that is the only thing that prevents me from calling this release absolute perfection.  There was one other thing and that is my Blu-ray discs came in a black DVD case, not the standard blue casing.  I was told that there will be two releases (in different casing, not inc. the limited edition) with one in a blue Blu-ray case and another using black DVD casing in order to educate those new to Blu-ray.I do think that Diamond Edition and the Platinum Edition are quite different in terms of presentation of special features and the goals were quite different of what kind of special features would be presented.  With the Platinum Edition, its solely focused on ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and in the Diamond Edition, there is more focus on giving the viewer the history of Walt Disney and the animators of how they got from Silly Symphonies to using their skills and technology in creating the first animated feature film.  So, as I have said earlier in my review, this release is more or less, a celebration of those who worked on the film and giving recognition to those animators and staff members who took part in that film and the work that they did earlier, that became instrumental in creating Snow White.So, overall...the Diamond Edition is just incredible when it comes to the actual digital restoration of this classic film and a release that is absolutely packed with special features.  ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition"" is a solid release that raises the bar of what Disney is capable of in terms of content in a home video release.  This is truly a magnificent release and is highly recommended!"	5.0	Blu-ray: Disney set the bar high in 2001 with the `Platinum Edition' release, this `Diamond Edition' sets the bar even higher	2009-10-02	111	96	15
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3QEJ40NQEW36Q	"Desired FX ""Call me Don. It's shorter than Is..."	Okay, first, let me say that this is a wonderful DVD.There's nothing I can add to all of the praise heaped on this collection--a beautiful transfer of the movie which looks as good as when I saw the digitally-refurbished re-release back in the 90s.  The discs are chock-full of games, trivia, archival footage, promotional material from each time the film was re-released, and on and on.I do have a warning, however:  at the time SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was released, there really was no such thing as widescreen cinema.  It was produced and exhibited in the 4:3 aspect ratio (standard TV shape).  If you have a widescreen TV, you'll either need to watch it distorted (about 33% wider than intended), framed by vertical bars (windowbox?), or trimmed at the top and bottom.It's a minor annoyance, though:  don't let it deter you from owning this masterpiece.	4.0	Caveat for owners of widescreen-format TVs.	2002-03-21	0	0	0

It comes with both a  DVD and Blu-Ray in the same package and it is a 3 disc combo.  The clarity of the color and the high definition audio makes the movie seem like it was made today not decades ago and then restored... Disney has truly outdone themselves, you can tell they took their time and spared nothing.There are so many extras that it will take quite a while to navigate through it all.There is Disney Family Play, backstage Disney and classic bonus like Dopey's wild Mine Ride games, Heigh-Ho karaoke sing along and more.

It was also cheaper on Amazon then in the stores. I only could find it in Toys R Us as Wal-Mart and Target did not have them when I looked. I bought them for a set of grand-daughters and a set of grandsons. The boys were not too excited until they watched it the first time and then they were sold. Those Dwarfs get them everytime. But it is Disney and who can argue with the Master of all animation? He certainly was well ahead of his time and children everywhere are certainly better for it. The Wonderful World of Disney made me want to go to Disneyland, which I have never been able to do. But with Disney's genius, have visited Epcot and Disney World seven times in my life and plan another trip in a couple of years to take all my five grandchildren so they don't have to wait until they are all grown up to go.	5.0	Snow White video DVD	2010-01-05	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3DIKJP95XTKX0	"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley"""	"Snow White is simply a milestone in the history of film making. It is one of those films that has ploughed a course through motion picture history, throwing off as it does so, bits and pieces that have been seized upon by later film makers, and turned into ideas and projects of their own. Many of today's film makers will cite this film as being a major early influence on their careers.Even today, the film's ability to generate emotion is unique on any media. It can still tug on the heart strings after repeat viewings. This comes down to characterisation, be it of Snow White herself, the animals that help her, or the Seven Dwarves.All are superbly realised and engage the audience accordingly. Maybe the strength of the Dwarves is that Disney filled their characters with many recognisable human traits, both strong and weak. Audiences could identify with them accordingly.Annoyingly, the character of Dopey has come under attack from the politically correct for allegedly demeaning people with learning difficulties etc. I would counter that with it is a depiction of someone with difficulties getting on with his life, enjoying it in the process, and being actively supported by his peers, who in very human terms, sometimes express impatience etc with him.As to the other dwarves, I think we can all recognise something of ourselves, our friends, and our relatives in all of them. Hence the fact that they are so engaging.The songs from the film have gained immortality and deservedly so. Despite not being a fan of musicals myself, this particular score is truly something else, and I still love it after all this time.Evil is starkly depicted in this tale in the form of the vain and envious Queen. Once she realises that her own beauty has been surpassed by that of Snow White then she goes all out to kill her. Is it any coincidence that as she becomes ever more murderous and vindictive, her outward appearance starts to match that within? Shortly after deciding to kill Snow White, she becomes the hideous witch, and her subsequent behaviour matches her looks.Her fate is particularly unpleasant but the morality of the tale is that her own deeds and actions ultimately bring it upon herself. There are no grey areas - the message is that evil ultimately brings evil upon the perpetrator.Ultimately this film has gained a wide ranging recognition as one of the greatest films ever made and deservedly so.I am fortunate enough to own one of the Platinum Edition dvds. Picture and sound are superb, in particluar the 5.1 transfer is stunning.If you can get hold of one of these dvds, then my advice is to buy it.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1HYJSN0EA9PTP	"""disneychick"""	"There are so many laudatory things one could say about the film itself--the first American feature-length animated film, its use of the multiplane camera, color, realistic animation, characters, and so forth. I will not go over such familiar territory here. Suffice it to say, if you have not seen SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS and you are at all interested in either animation or pivotal moments in film history itself, then you should fill that gap in your knowledge. That being said, I will confine my comments to the DVD edition itself as it might appeal primarily to the adult animation/Disney fan.First, there are a ton of extras here which include a range for almost anyone. Check out the list of contents--everything from an ""interactive"" ride with Dopey to archival material to technical information on the process of animation. Many other reviewers have listed their favorites, and I am no exception. A particularly nice addition is the Silly Symphony ""The Goddess of Spring."" It's always nice to buy a feature-length film and get a short that helps demonstrate technical aspects to animation. Also quite useful were excerpts from the Disneyland TV show which focused on technical information, including ""Tricks of the Trade."" This is a solid introduction to the multiplane camera. And then, for those of us who love paper as much as cels, there are production design galleries and posters from various theatrical releases. All these extras are combined in an easy-to-navigate format, which is much appreciated.Before addressing the reason for my 4 star rating I should comment on the DVD's overall tone. It is almost excessively indulgent, whether when expressed in the Disneyland excerpts or the guest appearances. Disney knows and lets the audience know that SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is a great product and that they also created a materful DVD. But it gets tiresome to hear how the world of Disney is so wonderful; the evidence should (and does) speak for itself. There is lots of shameless self-promotion here, much of it unnecessary and some of it irritating. More balanced commentary from historians and scholars like John Canemaker would have been preferable to the prescence of Angela Lansbury or the ""Disney Through the Decades"" cast; the ""testimonials"" felt like the actors were still under contract rather than offering heartful support to the film.I know, you might be thinking ""And shouldn't a company congratulate itself?"" To an extent, yes, and I would agree that this DVD is well worth the money. But--and these are the reasons which are enough for me to withhold a 5 star rating (I would have given it a 4 1/2 if there was such an option--there are some omissions, additions, and errors that interfere with my enjoyment of the DVD as both a Disneyphile and scholar. Surely ""The Old Mill"" was worthy of inclusion as the company's multiplane camera test short! More information in the galleries, to finally giving proper attribution to studio artists, would better satisfy those who would spend time perusing such material. Did we need Streisand's rendition? Most distressing for me is the inclusion of the so-called Brother Grimms version of Snow White; I will simply say the version they provide is incorrect, altered for a Disney audience (to check out for yourself, look at Norton's Critical edition of tales edited by Maria Tatar). In such a carefully wrought work, such an error is careless and suspect. There is also the concern with navigational speed; it seems a bit clunky at times, though I am more than willing to overlook this for the wealth of materials that Disney does include.Overall, the DVD is well worth the amount charged. It demonstrates the potential that DVD offers an informed audience and makes it possible for those new to animation or Disney to become an informed audience. I highly recommend adding it to your collection, even if you have yet to purchase a DVD player. However, I withhold a 5 star rating for its (rather obvious and unnecessary) omissions and errors, and its congratulatory, almost  smug tone."	4.0	Nearly Lives Up to (DVD/Film Enthusiasts') Expectations	2002-01-22	1	1	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A32BSM2A0B5SOF	Disney Reviewer	&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; has been a huge success since its initial release in the 30's. As a kid, it was one of the few Disney movies that I hadn't seen, until its home video release in '94. It instantly became one of my favorite Disney films. This DVD release is amazing. There are so many special features and they are all interesting. My personal favorite is the commentary by Walt Disney himself. They edited together audio clips from different interviews and they are played during scenes that are relevant to what's going on in the film. As for the restoration, Disney touched it up so perfectly that it looks new. The audio sounds like it was recorded in the 30's, but has been restored so you never hear any pops and crackles. Whether you are a Disney fan, an animation or movie buff, or someone who is buying this for their kids, no DVD collection is complete without it.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Walt Disney's first animated motion picture, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; is the bizarre mix of images that strike the mind in various ways. It's rare in any day to find such a film that delights one with humor and enchanting music, and at the same time gets under the skin with a dark sense of dread and urgency underneath its conflict. &quot;Snow White&quot; is not only a technical masterpiece, but a true work of art that stands out among the very best in any time period of cinema.For film historians, it stands out as a marvel of the achievement of technology. Being the first full-length animated feature of its kind, &quot;Snow White&quot; is seamless in its integration of detailed characters into articulately-drawn settings, with extreme attention of such details as water reflection, shadow movement, and even lip movement of the characters, an especially difficult task given the amount of song and dialogue. For this, it receives high marks all around, and earns itself a place in movie history.It's the ultimate battle of good and evil, in which young Snow White finds herself the target of the Queen's growing jealousy. She flees into the woods, where she comes to the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs, who gladly welcome the new arrival. Just as their friendship together becomes increasingly joyful, the movie darkens the tone with the Queen's transformation into an old peddler woman, hoping to rid herself of Snow White's threat to her being fairest in the land once again.&quot;Snow White&quot; is a special sort of film, one that is ceaseless in its ability to entertain the young and old. Watching it as a child is the ultimate experience, while watching it in later years will no doubt provide many with cherished memories of their first time seeing the film. It's the type of movie you find yourself looking back on with happiness and satisfaction, the mark of a truly great film.Perhaps the movie's most memorable aspect is its contrast of light and dark imagery, a neverending foray for some of the most memorable scenes and images ever put forth onto the screen. Snow White's happy existence among the Dwarfs is full of glee and humor, and provides delight at every turn of the story. In complete contrast, Snow White's escape into the forest takes us on a terrifying journey through our own worst fears; the scene is charged with suspense and an intensity unmatched by any modern movie. The Queen's transformation scene is an absinthe-induced hallucination of dizzying images, and the final confrontation between the Dwarfs and the Queen is a suspense-laden race against time.The film's most memorable trait is its musical score, filled with cheery melodies and upbeat tunes, from the infamous &quot;Heigh Ho&quot; and &quot;Whistle While You Work,&quot; to the operatic &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come.&quot; Just as this music is full of joy, there are chords of music that are extremely unsettling, such as that of the opening shot, in which we see the castle looming over the river, set to high-pitched strings that set a foreboding tone. The music works with the movie to bring out the emotions it wants us to feel, whether it be overjoyed exuberance or nervous anticipation.It's everything a perfect fairy tale should be, and the film captures not only the Grimm's tale magnificently, but also realizes the many ways in which fairy tales manage to work our minds. It takes us to a place in our fancy, the places we cherish and adore, and the places we would rather leave behind. At its center is a story full of moral truth and virtue, and every nuance is brought to stunning life with love and care put forth. &quot;Snow White&quot; is the ultimate masterpiece, a cherished piece of movie history that remains with you long after it has finished, and one that will be forever remembered.	5.0	The best animated film of all time!	2001-10-14	2	0	2

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A11C43I615R52G	"Don Vito Corleone ""The Joker"""	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a classic film that is one of my all time favorites. Walt Disney's first full animated feature film its an artistic masterful achievement. The film was a great triumph in 1937 and is still a great triumph today, nearly 73 years after. Aside from being the first animated film and the one that paved the way to the creation of the Disney empire as we know it today with dozens of many animated films in its catalogue most of them redeemed as classics today, Snow White happens to be a fantastic film. It has a great plot, a great story with great characters, music and heart. This makes this film as fresh as it was in its original theatrical release so many years ago. Disney has always treated this masterpiece as such and in 2001 it was release as a 2-Disc Platinum edition DVD. This DVD was the best of the Platinum line and one of the best DVDs ever produced. Disney again does the film justice releasing it now as part of the Diamond line in Bluray and the results are better than ever.Snow white looks fantastic in hi def with vivid colors, sharpness and a clean transfer. The Platinum looked terrific but Disney topped themselves with this new transfer. Absolutely marvelous. The DTS MA 7.1 is also very crisp and clear but don't expect it to rock your house. Nonetheless, is a great audio. Purists will be glad that the original mono track has been also restored and included here.The Platinum Edition was a pioneer for the vast content that had about the movie., This Diamond edition does the same in a more interactive way that inmerse you much more in the world of Snow White. The Hyperion Studios feature is fantastic.The only negative thing I can count is that not everything from the Platinum Edition has been carried over to the Diamond. If you(like me) are an avid fan of Snow White, you should hold onto both because together they make the ultimate deluxe edition of this film. The DVD that is included here also looks fantastic and better than the Platinum. A 5.1 DEHTM is also included.As you can see, this diamond edition of Snow White is deluxe treatment for a deluxe film. While is unfortunate that not everything from the Platinum got place here, this new edition is oustanding nonetheless. Just Buy it. Completely Recommended.Note: This film is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 fullscreen which is the right aspect ratio of the film. Viewers who want a widescreen experience can watch the film with Disneyview that fills the black bars with backgrounds similar to the ones in the film.	5.0	Disney Animated Classic #1: A Masterpiece Looking Better than Ever!!!	2009-04-28	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A26DQMYF5E0GL6	Don Walton Jr.	Watching 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' for the first time in 20 years, and the first time as an adult, I was surprised at how well the film holds up.  It's full of easily relatable, but genuinely charming, humor and gorgeous hand drawn animation.  For long-time fans, I'm probably not tell you anything new, but if, like me, you have not seen the film in years, please check it out.Also, its easy to share with your grandma on her tube tv.  The blu-ray includes 'Disneyvision' a process that features the film in a full frame aspect, but instead of hearing granny complain about the 'black lines on the screen!', the unused screen space is filled with beautiful framing, complimenting each scene.  For example, there may be pillars in the castle, or trees and vines framing a forest scene.  A very nice touch.  After a few minutes, the framing melded with the animation and felt like a wonderful addition.  I watched it on a widescreen television, but wanted to check out this new feature.A gem to share with younger generations as well as old time fans.	5.0	The epitome of a 'classic' film	2012-05-24	0	0	0

KIA RETURNS! ;-b"""	It's hard to imagine that Disney could improve upon their Platinum Edition DVD set of Snow White, but they have for the most part released the definitive edition here with the Diamond Blu Ray/ DVD combo. The first full length animated feature from Disney looks and sounds nothing short of amazing, but sometimes perfection comes with its drawbacks. There are imperfections in the film that are more obvious now, still overall this is a miraculous achievement for Disney. I only wish they would treat all there films with this much care.The film itself is a classic with painstaking and breathtaking animation, filled with wonderful songs and voice work. There are some that think these early Disney films are too intense for younger viewers, but I saw them at a very young age and I don't remember being all that terrified at least not for any extended period.The bonus features are exhaustive here, but like all Disney releases they always leave features out from previous releases. This is an irritating marketing ploy that drives me crazy, but since the older releases don't always fetch top dollar on the after market, I tend to keep them for the supplements that are missing from the other releases if I find the exclusions important enough to warrant it. I also like to watch the films on these releases as they do differ and in most cases look more like I remember as a child.There are many excellent new bonus features, but considering the small amount of space the standard def stuff takes up, these discs could have included the important bonus features left off from the Platinum Edition. I've ended up keeping most of the really well done DVD editions along with the Blu Ray editions, but video shelf space is always a consideration in my film library, so it is frustrating to say the least. If you don't own any edition the Blu Ray is the way to go, if you own the Platinum edition, then you'll have to decide if you want to upgrade or keep it for the bonus features.	5.0	STILL THE FAIREST ONE OF ALL!

My pics for the Timeless 5 of Disney's Classics, (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Dumbo and Pinnochio) a must. I loved these when I was growing up in the 50's. We had LP's with the movies soundtrack. Owning something like this was just unheard of in those days, We knew the music and dialogue by heart. Then came VHS. Now we can buy or rent a copy, and build our own library My son has enjoyed them. And I know his kids will also. Digital Remastering has cleaned up the wonderful animation, making the colors vibrant again. Bringing them into the next millenium. These stories not only entertain and have a moral lesson to learn. But also teach the  importance of sharing and kindness. Good quality, hard to find in children's entertainment.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2MVPY9XVYST9H	"D_Strasse ""D_Strasse"""	"What can one say about Snow White and the Seven Dwarves? This movie is the definition of classic, and most people already know if they like the movie or not.  For that reason, I won't get too much into the actual movie other than to say that after having watched this disc again, my preconceptions of the movie have changed over the years.  What was once simple and unappealing has taken on a deeper and more nuanced meaning. For those that haven't seen this movie since their childhood, I would recommend revisiting it to see if your opinion has changed.  Mine certainly has.Now to this actual package and the burning question for most:  Should I upgrade?First, picture quality.  As per all of the recent Disney Blu-rays, picture and sound quality are absolutely top notch.  Comparing this disc to the previous 2-disc platinum DVD, it can be seen that picture quality has indeed been improved.  Colors are rich and vibrant and some scenes look as if they were painted on the screen.  Stunning.  This is somewhat suprising considering the previous set was no slouch.  Leaving no stone unturned, hi-def mono is included for purists along with hi-def 7.1 audio.As to the set as a whole.  Wow!  Disney sure knows how to put a package together and this set seems to have it all.  Included for a limited time is a DVD version of the movie, nice for families that have DVD players in other rooms or need one for a travel player.  (and another reason why this set might make your old platinum set obsolete.)  Note though that a Digital Copy is not included.Comparing the extras.  Again, wow.  the Hyperion Studios tour on the second disc is almost worth the price of admission alone.  It is separated into sections representing the various departments within the studio.  Each section is displayed as a high def capture of an old black and white photo taken of that department in the studio.  And as old as the photos are, they absolutely pop off the screen.  Info is presented as narrated bits of old footage and sound clips to explain what went on in this area of the studio.Also included in each section are old Disney cartoons, like the Silly Symphonies ""Music Land"" and Mickey Mouse ""Steamboat Willie"" and ""Playful Pluto"".  Classics all and a real treat.  Note that some of these are on the Platinum set but more are on offer here.My only real gripe with the Hyperion studios tour is that it is laid out in a very confusing manner and is easy to get lost in.  That is unless you know to press down on your remote to bring up the index, which handily shows you which clips you've already watched.So in summation, this disc is highly recommended.  For the movie, the image quality, and the extras.  It is worthy upgrade for Disney fans appreciative of the wealth of extras and for anyone looking for the best representation of an animation milestone."	5.0	Blu-ray review	2009-10-20	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AA5XZVANDXGJE	"""dvdcollector18"""	"""Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs"" was, like said tons of times before, a historic landmark in motion pictures. And now, in 2001, it's DVD release will be a landmark in the DVD industry.The first release of 10 ""Platinum Edition"" titles, ""Snow White"" has received a complete restoration. I was skeptical at how much could be done with a film that was nearly 65 years old. The picture is incredible, makes other DVDs that were ""restored"" seem like embarassments. It seems like the movie was made a few months ago. The 5.1 mix only added some depth to the music, not much change to anything else. The film's original mono mix is also included.What struck me most about the film, was that it wasn't dated at all, despite what others may say. You do get a little nostolgic, but that's good. In fact, of all the other films from Disney, none come close to Snow White in any way. Even the recent ones, with all of their advancements in animation, no, they just can not compare.The DVD showcases tons of extras, listed above. The best ones are ""The Making Of Snow White"", and ""Disney Through The Decades"" (even though Disney's history is rushed a little). Things that caught my eye in ""The Queens Castle"" on Disc 2 were the excerpts from ""Tricks Of Our Trade"", where Walt Disney shares secrets on how Disney 'toons are done and improved upon using new technologies (many that he invented, i.e The Multi-Plane Camera). A brief documentary on the restoration of the film is fun to watch, in ""The Wishing Well"". And the vast Galleries of drawings for the film are great to look at.There is just way too much to review. I've had the DVD for two days, and I still have ""The Dwarfs Mine"" and ""Cottage"" to go through. If next year's ""Beauty & The Beast: Platinum Edition"" is anything like this DVD (and it will be), it will be another essential. Get ""Snow White"" as soon as you can!P.S I'm glad to see that Walt Disney Studios are acknowledging in these ""Platinum"" titles, that these films are not just ""kid cartoons"" and are including these in-depth extras for movie fans of an older generation"	5.0	Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs - Walt Disney's First & Best!	2001-10-13	4	4	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2BMZRO0H7TFCS	Ed	Given the significance of the 1937 release of Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs to film and to Disney, it makes sense that it is the first of the Diamond Edition releases from Disney.  The Blu-ray version is easily the clearest and most vibrant video presentation of the film ever released.  The audio has been cleaned up too but you won't notice it as much due to how amazing the video is presented.  As a bonus, this edition also includes the DVD version for a total of 3 discs.Should you choose, you can view the film in the original 4:3 aspect ratio or select Disney View, which allows 16:9 but instead of just plain black bars on each side of the screen, Disney filled the entire screen with painted panels.  I prefer watching the 4:3 myself but it is neat that they at least offered the choice.  The audio has been upgraded to high definition 7.1.The most interesting of the exclusive extras for me was a tour of Walt's original Hyperion Studios and the newly discovered storyboards, which begs the question of whether a sequel was being planned.  Other extras include interactive games and a music video.The included DVD version of the film is a terrific bonus for added viewing flexibility.  The last time I checked, Blu-ray players were not yet prevelent in cars, portables, or laptops.  The value of this offering is outstanding.  If you're a fan of Disney or of just the film, you won't regret owning this Diamond Edition combo.  It is definitely the fairest digital version of them all.	5.0	The fairest digital version of them all	2009-10-08	5	5	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1TOH8S8I1VT9R	"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real"""	"I just bought this film.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to find (check out my review date).  For anyone collecting Disney animated features; GRAB IT NOW!!What can I say about the film that hasn't been said.  Despite its' age (The first successful animated feature)it has some of my favorite Disney animated moments.  This film carries with it a sense of real innocence and purity of story that has not been acheived since.  Here is a list of what I liked about this DVD and Film;THE FILM-Again, purity and innocence of story.-Dance sequence in dwarfs cottage, one of the most joyful in film history.-Dwarfs mourning over the Princess, one of the most heart-wrenching in film history.-As benign as the Princess is, she has moments of incredible charm and like-ability; ""YOU must be GRUMPY"" hits the nail on the head!!-Wicked Queen starts the Disney tradition of villains with a bang.  She's so mean and crazy she taunts skeletons in her dungeon; ""..WANT A DRINK!?"".-Artwork is dated... ...and icredibly charming. The colors used are breathtaking.-Songs are timeless.THE DVD-Quality of picture and sound as good as can be expected for the time of original production.  You really must nit-pick to find a flaw.-Extras are overwhelming!!-Dopey's mine ride is a cute little game.-Deleted scenes a real treat.  One of them actually fully colored with backgrounds.  ""Musical Soup"" is hillarious!-""The Goddess of Spring"" short film is very interesting.  It's use as a ""test"" for the Snow White concept is obvious.  Some good chuckles for it's crude execution.-The worst thing with this DVD is how difficult it is removing the disks from their hubs.-I wish Wide Screen existed when Disney made this film, just imagine....Why the first Successful animated feature?  There were other(s?) made before Snow White, including Max Fliechers ""Gullivers Travels"" which rushed production to get to theaters ahead of Disney.  However, no previous attempt captivated audiences minds, hearts and money like ""Snow White"".  ""Snow White"" validated the financial side of making an animated feature.Regrettably, I've owned this DVD for 24 hours so I have not had the time to view all of it.  However, it's safe to say that I love it so far!  I'm not an ""easy"" critic for what that's worth. I know this is a pricey DVD even by Disney standards.  But consider that my collection of 200 DVDs has an average price of $11 and I do not regret this purchase for one minute!!!

I was expecting a grainy picture, but the picture quality is fantastic for such an old movie.Then there's all the extras!  Wow!!  You could spend a full day just checking out disk 2!  Disk 1 also has its fair share of extras.  One of the extras is Dopey's Wild Ride.  It's an interactive triva game, and the questions are quite hard (one requires you to match the dwarf to his musical instrument!).  This is definitely one of the better games I've seen on DVDs (much better than the games on Shrek).  Disk 2 is full of features such as deleted scenes and old trailers for the movie.  Also included on disk 2 is a comparison of the storyboard to the actual movie.  This is a pretty neat feature because you can use the angle button to toggle between the different scenes.I was surprised to see how dramatic this movie is.  If you have young children, be sure to watch it with them the first time they view the movie.  When I was 4, the Snow White ride was the only ride that scared me at Disney World, and I think the movie could do the same to young children!	4.0	An amazing DVD	2001-12-27	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AXFI7TAWD6H6X	Erica Anderson	Disney once again reaches into its vaults and dust off one of its classic films to give it a proper remastering treatment. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is Disney's latest film to have received a remastering treatment and is being released as a diamond edition. I could not imagine anything less for Disney's first feature length animated film. I have the 3 disc combo pack which includes the dvd of the film (for those who do not have a blu ray player  like me), disc 2 is the blu-ray version, and disc three is chock full of bonus footage which will really please the younger viewers.I admit I have forgotten when the last time I actually had watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I am more the positive that the last time I saw it was when I was still a little girl. The story of Snow White hiding from her wicked stepmother and living among seven dwarfs is timeless. Even at 35, I am still entertained by the story. The animation is beautiful and vibrant, especially the apple. The sound quality is just as good. I definitely recommend buying the diamond edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I don't think you are too old to watch this timeless classic.	5.0	A wonderful film for everyone in the family	2009-10-04	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A146D2LYLICNLS	eric_f	Disney's &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; is one of those classic films that truly deserve the title of &quot;classic.&quot; This is a true marvel of film-making, considering how long ago it was made, a time when animated technology was obviously still in its primitive stages. This is simply an astronomical accomplishment.This Platinum Edition 2-disc DVD is what each and every fan of this movie has been dreaming about. Presentation is superb, both in terms of quality as well as bonus content. Sound and image have both been remastered and restored for an excellent viewing experience. And of course, the bonus features...so much of them that it can get overwhelming (not that I'm complaining!). I share the sentiments of some reviewers here who are upset about Disney discontinuing this title, but what's one to do. eBay is still the best place to buy a copy, if you don't mind paying quite a bit for it. I didn't buy myself a copy before it got discontinued but I found a brand new copy at a CVS/Pharmacy store (I kid you not) of all places. Yes, it is true. And what's even more unbelievable, I saw a copy for sale at another CVS store as well. And no, these are not pirated copies. I highly doubt every CVS will have one, but next time you're in there pay attention to their DVD stock. You might find yourself quite happy.	5.0	Almost a century ahead of its time	2004-04-29	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3M06TE1J42O3T	"erugifog ""erugifog"""	Both the video and audio of this Disney classic have been well restored in this Diamond Edition release.  Contrary to what another reviewer here has written, the colors, IMO, have not been made overly vivid.  This restoration retains the look of classic cel animation yet has been refreshed to look how I imagine it must have appeared when this film debuted in 1937.  After all, Disney would know better than anyone what the original colors would have looked like and applied that knowledge in the restoration process.  In addition, the audio has also been well restored and sounds remarkably good for a film that is over 70 years old.  I did not watch the included DVD version of the feature in its entirety, but I forwarded through it enough to tell that it looks very good, too.  If you have yet to buy a Blu-ray player but want to future-proof your purchase, you can enjoy the DVD version now and the Blu-ray version later when you have a Blu-ray player.The bonus feature I enjoyed most was two scenes that had been cut from the original release for pacing reasons.  One is a soup-eating scene where the dwarves eat soup Snow White made for them while they sing a song.  The other is a bed-making scene where the dwarves make a bed for Snow White as a gift.  Fortunately, the dialogue, sound and music tracks were recorded at the time, so you can watch the scenes with the audio that would have been used had the scenes been included.  Unfortunately, the animation never got to the coloring phase, so the animation is just pen and ink (and in a few spots there are only static, non-animated sketches).  While I understand why these scenes were cut, they are still enjoyable to watch as extras and provide a fun look at what might have been.If you're a fan of this Disney film, you'll enjoy watching it in its restored state on this Diamond Edition release.	5.0	Beautiful restoration of a Disney classic	2010-01-26	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1ROYTFVKXZUY5	E. Smith	"I was very excited to receive this DVD, as Snow White is simply a Disney classic that is unparalleled.This two-disc DVD is a Blu-Ray/DVD combo ""Diamond"" edition, so in my opinion the value is fantastic. You get a two disc Blu-Ray, and 1-Disc DVD of the full length movie. The quality of the movie sure has improved from the days of VHS, which was the last medium in which I watched this movie. The colors are more rich and vibrant, it is much more clear, the sound is high definition (for the first time ever), and all in all it makes for a fantastic viewing experience. I also love the packaging on this set!I think what I love most about this DVD (as well as most any Disney DVD) is the amount of extras. Included in this set is ""Snow White Returns"" which includes storyboards, a piece where you explore the original studio, a bit about how Snow White changed movies forever, and you also get a sneak peak of Disney's new movie ""The Princess and The Frog."" Of course, you also have a number of games, a music video, a karaoke sing-along and lots of other fun things to play around with.I think for anyone who enjoys this movie, or for anyone who collects Disney movies this is a must. The quality of the movie is like none seen before, and the fact that you are getting both DVD and Blu-Ray in one set is a huge plus. Very impressive."	5.0	Wonderful!	2009-10-15	0	0	0

We got the DVD a few months back, but just saw it with a group of children that were visiting and chose this to be the entertainment of the night. The quality is superb, the sound magnificent. Soon we found ourselves immersed in the story of a queen who is vain and wicked, trying hard to forever be the fairest in the land.Snow White grows to be a very beautiful princess and soon, the enchanted mirror tells the Queen that she is no longer the most beautiful, the title now goes to Snow White.Jealousy and envy drive the queen to attempt to eliminate the fair princess. Snow White meets the seven dwarfs, who live in the forest, and we find ourselves singing right along with them... ""Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, It's home from work we go, Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho.""The creatures of the forest are marvelous as they help Snow White with daily chores. Some of the most endearing moments in movie history. In the end, love saves the day... and Snow White has her dream come true. Unforgettable song: ""some day my prince will come, some day we'll meet again, and away to his castle we'll go, to be happy forever I know.""""Some day when spring is here, we'll find our love anew, and the birds will sing, and wedding bells will ring, some day when my dreams come true!"""	5.0	Snow White's dream comes true!	2007-04-11	7	6	1

Short and sweet, uncomplicated.  Great for smaller children, although that nasty queen can be scary.  My granddaughter loves it - particulary the simple well-known songs.  She loves that the handsome prince saves Snow White.This movie may look lame up against the latest technology of Pixar (which I love), but an important childhood story.  I think we forget that children are still children anymore, and that sharing these simple stories is an important step in childhood.

I recently found out that Snow White was the very first Disney Princess and dates back to 1937!!! So I am excited that my daughter loves her so much, as I did when I was a little girl. I particularly like how Snow White takes care of the Dwarfs and they take care of her too. What a great lesson in good old fashioned friendship. I also like the message that vanity only leads to bad things, beauty will always fade, but friendship will last a lifetime! The evil queen is a bit menacing and orders her huntsman to KILL Snow White and bring her heard back in a wood box, so if your child gets scared easily I would recommend fast forwarding through her scenes until your child is a little older and can handle it. But the dwarfs are so hilarious and Snow White is just as lovely as ever! A classic I recommend to all little princesses!!	5.0	In love with Snow White	2013-08-29	1	0	1
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2NH0LIDP2I8RQ	"""fabriciojimenez"""	Love Disney movies, but personally can't stand Michael Eisner, his tyrannical rule of the Disney company, destroying the legacy that Walt built, and despise the &quot;Moratorium&quot; that is imposed on certain movies. It's not about keeping the movies &quot;fresh&quot;, it's about trying to create &quot;collectibles&quot; and driving up the product's price once they go out-of-print.That having said, Disney first said that the moratorium for the Platinum Edition movies would last 10 years. Then they announce that it would only last 5 years. Does that mean that &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; will be re-released in 2006 and 2007, respectively? Or does that only apply to the movies released after the announcement? Everything I have seen up to now seems to point out &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;BATB&quot; won't be seen for another 10 years.

It's more a question of TV system. I live in Japan, and since the U.S. and Japan TV systems are the same, I can theoretically watch American blu-ray discs in Japan.  I bought the U.S. version of Sleeping Beauty, and it played beautifully on my player here in Japan.  My only regret is that the Disney ""restoration"" team managed in screwing up the color scheme of the film for viewers in all countries!Snow White was released on Blu-ray a little bit prior to Japan. I couldn't wait to see it, so I got one from the U.S. and put it in my Japanese player.  But this time, a screen popped up telling me that certain portions would not be accessible in some territories.  The menu came on. I chose ""Watch the film"" with normal view. The screen went black and stayed that way. Then I tried ""special features"". Same thing.  I only attempted these two items. Both didn't work. Disc 2 played wonderfully.So I thought, ""Well--I guess I'll have to buy the Japanese version, since I'm living here.""  To my shock, the items I failed to open in the American disc are now not accessible in the Japanese disc either. It is as if the machine remembers what happened before, and is perpetuating the problem.  And so, my friends, in order to see Snow White in Blu-ray, the only avenue open is to buy another player, one that hasn't been tainted with this ""bug"".  What I didn't try to access before was the movie with ""Disney View"".  It works, but I find the ever-changing paintings on both sides of the screen very distracting! (Well-painted, but distracting.)Walt Disney's sole motivation was to make sure the paying public got the maximum of entertainment value from his great works.  It seems that the folks at Disney nowadays have an unnatural obsession with micro-managing things so that they control every little thing buyers of their discs get to see or don't get to see.  The changed colors in the Sleeping Beauty Blu-ray are an annoying example.I bought the 70th anniversay Blu-ray edition (U.S.) of The Wizard of Oz. Both discs play on my Japanese player like a dream!  THIS IS WHAT BLU-RAY WAS MEANT TO DO.For their wonderful Blu-ray presentation, I give MGM an A+.

But, the huntsman tells Snow White to run away and never return to the castle. Snow White runs through the enchanted forest the whole night, imagining things. After Snow White finds a giant group of animals, she asks them where she can stay. Luckily, they lead her to the seven dwarfs' house. The seven dwarfs are diamond miners. Snow White cleans the house while she is there, with the help of the animals. The seven dwarfs at first do not want it clean. They like cobwebs and spiders and dust. The wicked queen, when she finds out the huntsman tricked her, makes a potion to disguise herself as an old hag, as well as a poison apple which she offers to Snow White. The wicked queen tells Snow White that the apple is really a wishing apple, only she made the whole thing up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can the seven dwarfs save Snow White from the wicked queen? You'll really like this animated film. Buy it this minute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	5.0	A 7-year-old's review	2005-11-10	6	4	2

In addition to the full length feature remastered both audio and visually, we get interactive games, many documentaries, radio broadcasts, a Barbara Streisand music video of a remake of ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" and many ""hidden"" links that will provide your youngster with hours upon hours of entertainment.Disney has hit upon a great way to make the DVD more than just a passive medium and has fully exploited all the ways to bring out the full potential of this powerful new medium.  I just wonder how much better this would be once they get around to putting this on the Blu-ray platform!  For adults like me, I still found myself fully enjoying this DVD and especially for the well remastered visuals and the Dolby 5.1 surround sound option in addition to the old mono original.This Platinum Edition Series is a brilliant idea that is very well executed by Disney and it leaves me very interested in getting all the other movies in this series such as ""Beauty and the Beast"" as well.Full value for money and well worth getting for your kids.Highly recommended."	5.0	An Excellent Idea to Bring a True Classic Into the Current Century!	2008-02-10	2	2	0

This Diamond Edition Combo Pack includes 2 Blu-ray discs and a DVD. I am impressed with the exceptional picture quality and sound quality. If you did not know that Snow White was originally made in 1937 or did not already watch it when you were young, one probably would assume that it had just been made recently.  I am still amazed at what Disney accomplished with Snow White in term of technical and artistic excellence back in the 1930's. I'm personally not fond of the plot, the magic spell, the unrealistic portrayal of ""love"" and ""marriage"", and the voice of Snow White. However, my sons (10 and 8 years old) seemed to enjoy the DVD. We still laughed and had a good time. We do not have a Blu-ray player. They claim that Blu-ray discs are scratch resistant which sounds nice to me. If you are a fan of Snow White, you would love this combo pack.  For the first time ever, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is made in High Definition 7.1 Sound. From this combo pack, you will enjoy bonus features such as an all new music video, Dopey's Wild Mine Ride Game, ""Heigh-Ho""Karaoke Sing-Along, will be able to play games (What Do You See?, Mirror, Mirror On the Wall, Jewel Jumble), and will get to see behind the scenes stuff of ""The One that Started It All."""	3.0	The One that Started It All	2009-10-06	1	0	1
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2KSRJFZ2R9JK3	Fuwwyfootpaws	Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is one of the best animated films of all time. A terrific movie that has been known to be both enjoyable and frightening. It is a film with a whole range of emotions. It has beautiful songs and great writing.This movie also has one of the best and most evil Disney villains.The film is based on a German fairy tale by The Brothers Grimm. It is about a Princess named Snow White who lives with her evil stepmother, The Queen. The Queen fears that one day Snow White's beauty might surpass her own. So she dresses Snow White in rags and makes her work as a servant in the castle. The Queen has a magic mirror which she speaks to and asks it who is the fairest in the land. The mirror however tells her that rags won't hide Snow White's beauty, and that Snow White is more fair than her.The Princess meets a Prince whom she falls in love with, but the Queen becomes jealous and demands her huntsman to kill Snow White and bring her heart back to her to prove it.When the huntsman is about to kill the Princess, he realizes he can't do it, and he begs for her to forgive him. He tells her to run away because the Queen wants her dead. In a panic, Snow White runs through the forest and she sees many scary creatures that grab at her. Most of it is because she is scared, and her imagination is taking over. She then falls to the ground and starts crying. The creatures she saw were simply forest animals. When she looks up, she apologizes to them saying she was just frightened. They then take her to a cottage in the woods where she can live, but the cottage is the home of seven dwarfs who work in a diamond mine.Snow White cleans the house with the animals, then she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return, we get a lot of cute and funny scenes between the Princess and the sweet dwarfs.The rest of the film is about the Queen creating a disguise using magic, and going after Snow White. The movie has a beautiful and happy ending that made me cry.The movie is extremely well written, has great voice acting, and the animation is spectacular. It is a great film for absolutely everyone.	5.0	One of the best animated films of all time	2013-05-24	0	0	0

Snow White's PQ and AQ are just awesome on this transfer. Perfect way to present to your little ones or older crowd who may have seen the film many of times. Watching this transfer of the film on a good HD set up with surround is just a totally new experience. Remember the aspect ratio is not the typical 16:9 so you'll have bars on each side of the screen, although Disney has put some thought into it and you can enable a feature that replaces the plain black bars with pictures that blend into the movie.

Even now, some seventy years after it was first seen, this simple version of the famous Grimm fairy-tale can still cast a spell through storytelling pure and simple.  And the DVD formatted film is astonishingly beautiful--brilliantly colored--incredibly clear--so beautiful that no matter how often you may have seen the film in the past you will feel that you now see it for the first time.The extras are enough to fill out a second disk and include everything from background art to timelines to trivia games.  Some of it is very interesting indeed; some of it I found rather tedious.  But... so what?  The important thing, the thing you're actually buying the DVD for, is SNOW WHITE, right?

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2CTLEOV2E3PLC	Glen Boisseau Becker	".... SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is the most charming movie I know, bar none, and richly rewards repeated viewings.  Nothing in recent years, or in the future, is likely to equal the artistry of the hand-drawn animation, or the beauty of the youthful yet classically trained singing voices.  Yes, Adriana Caselotti gave her coloratura tones and soubrette speaking voice a cartoonish tinge, as part of the characterization.  But anyone who cannot get used to her sound within five minutes and appreciate its humor is beyond hope.  .... One feature unfortunately still absent from the track listing is the full-length soundtrack recordings of songs like ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""The Dwarfs' Yodel Song,"" which were seriously shortened before being used in the finished film.  If I remember correctly, only the RCA 78s (and their BMG reissue on CD) included the longer versions of the songs.  ....And while the Disney studio keeps drawing our attention to a few of the Frank Churchill songs that were not used in this movie at all, it would be more interesting to see reproductions of the sheet music for the familiar songs, and to hear the sheet-music arrangements faithfully performed.  These, too, were usually longer versions, with distinctly different lyrics that various popular singers eventually recorded.  (For example, Richard Tauber's eloquent vintage single of the Prince's ""One Song""--truly a desert-island recording--begins with a long-forgotten stanza that builds sublimely to the first chorus.) In the movie, almost every song is shortened to a single chorus, and the words for ""Heigh-Ho"" consist of only two lines, endlessly repeated!  ...."	4.0	Let's get the facts straight.	2001-08-07	3	3	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A7Y6AVS576M03	gobirds2	SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is Walt Disney's cinematic treasure, a story undiminished by its age and now restored once again to the highest technical standards available. SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was the first of many Disney feature films noted for their great emotional power. Although enthusiasts of the Grimm version have criticized Disney's retelling as being too cute and maudlin, the film does contain some genuinely fear-inspiring moments and parents should be cautious about having smaller children view this film. My daughter is a teenager and she still can not watch it. The animation is powerful and consuming. In a true visual representation of the confrontation of good and evil, the climactic chase of the queen by the dwarfs brilliantly demonstrates the power of animation. The coloring of the heavens, the shadows, the falling boulders, and the two apocalyptic vultures that lurk above, swooping downward after the queen plunges to her doom are all well conceived indelible images of the forces of evil being vanquished. SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is a classic film. It is an outstanding example of the wonder and brilliance of Walt Disney's animation, and a technical milestone. It is an icon in the history of all cinema let alone animated cinema. Of all the DVD extras, and there are many, I really enjoyed the segment on the history of Disney chronicled by the release and numerous theatrical re-releases of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS. It was really good to see Fess Parker (Davy Crockett) and Dean Jones host some of these segments. Concerning the restoration of the film this time around I found the audio restoration incredible. For a film that old, the sound especially the score sounded brilliant. This is an essential DVD.	5.0	Haunting Animation and Brilliant Music	2001-10-04	2	2	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3QRW0UJPKIAX7	Grant Fritchey	What's not to love? Snow White, digitally remastered on blu ray. What else can be said. OK. More can be said. There's a bunch of extras too. And a copy of the movie on DVD.I sat down and watched this with the kids. There was the unfortunate interminable set of previews that all Disney disks seem to sport these days. But once you get through them, it was a great experience. My kids are slightly old for Snow White, but they loved it anyway. It's so beautiful, with the rotoscoping, and the colors are so rich with this new print on blu ray... it's almost impossible not to enjoy this.As for the extra's, the games were kind of like most games on blu ray & dvd... silly & weak. But the documentaries were simply amazing. All that information about the making of the film, the history of Disney, amazing, interesting and entertaining stuff.It's worth picking this up if you have young kids. They're going to love it. You'll probably enjoy it too and then you can watch the documentaries and get more out of the purchase.	5.0	Perfection	2010-04-21	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2UBSGFCP2QFNV	"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'"""	"It's getting more and more difficult for Blu-Ray resisters to resist getting Blu-Ray, now that The Wizard of Oz and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs are available in crystalline clarity. The new Snow White Diamond Edition has so much new material, that when you combine it with the previous Platinum Edition (which still has some features not included on the new release), it can almost be thought of as ""The Art of Snow White, Volumes 1 and 2.""In addition to the picture quality, the new Blu-Ray offers an interactive Magic Mirror feature, an immersive visit to Disney's Hyperion Studio, where Walt and his staff worked until Snow White's huge success made the Burbank location affordable.But my favorite, and if you've read my earlier reviews you know where I'm going with this, is the audio commentary. Animation historian John Canemaker, who wrote the excellent Making of the Animated Raggedy Ann & Andy book among other important works, provides a diamond mine of information -- with none other than Walt Disney himself providing his own comments through interviews.It's one thing to read about Walt and Roy Disney getting feature film negotiation advice from Charlie Chaplin, it's downright amazing to hear him explain it in his own words. You can even hear Walt admit that he actually hated Snow White for a while because he wearied of living in its shadow and having every subsequent project compared to it. That's the sort of frustration you may not have thought about in hindsight, since Walt did so much since, but it underscores the importance of this film -- perhaps the one project that made everything after it possible.There are two Blu-Ray discs included, loaded with the features, plus a standard DVD of the feature as well. The commentary appears on both formats. If you're on the fence about Blu-Ray, this is a chance to compare the two and decide. If you'd prefer the whole thing in DVD, it is apparently going to be released on November 24, but of course without the interactive technologies only possible on the new format."	5.0	The fairest reason of them all to switch to Blu-Ray	2009-10-19	2	2	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3RBVL167FXSOV	Gregory L Dyas	I know I'm probably speaking to alot of Disneyphiles by posting here and some of what I'll say might be heresy, but I figure an honest review beats mindless fawning.First, the DVD.  It's about as laden with extra stuff as DVDs can get, and if you're a cartoon lover or Disneyphile there are alot of treasures here.  Film clips, a song that got cut, storyboarding... you name it, it's there.  I personally completely hate the Streisand performance of &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot;.  She out-sugars Adriana Caselotti, and that takes some doing.  But in the end, if extras are what you look for in DVDs it's got that in spades.Now for the film.  Though I'm completely cognisant of Snow White's landmark status in animated film history I have to say the movie drags more than a little through the middle.  In retrospect it seems obvious that Disney was doing what alot of directors do today -- skating by on good visuals at the expense of story.  Of course it worked at that time, and Snow White remains an important and interesting film, but looking back at it from today's standards and comparing it to current work done by Disney, it dates badly.  The animation, revolutionary at the time, just doesn't do it for me and the story I doubt would be interesting to anyone other than very small children (5 &amp; under) of today.If you buy your DVDs for the movie &amp; not the extras, you might want to rent Snow White &amp; see if your memories match the actual film.  You might, like me, find yourself both surprised &amp; a bit bored.	4.0	Great DVD, but I've got some suggestions &amp; quibbles	2001-11-12	5	1	4
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	ACKDSX71VI5HY	"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader"""	"SPOILERS FOLLOWWalt Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is a phenomenal accomplishment.  With the voice talents of Adriana Caselotti and Lucille LaVerne, among many others, the 1937 film works on a visceral emotional level, and features wonderful songs.It combines stunning visuals with a first-rate story.  The extreme contrast between the unquestioned goodness of Snow White and the evil malevolence of the queen serves the story very well.  Certain scenes come to mind as exemplary for combining artistic values with emotional effectiveness.  Among them are(SPOILER)Snow White's scared run through the forest, and the psychological tricks her imagination plays on her.  The queen's famous transformation into the old crone is executed with fearless abandon.Arguably no other telling of this story places such emphasis on the dwarfs.  Happy, Dopey, Sleepy, Bashful, Doc, Sneezy, and Grumpy are all uniquely created personalities and very likable overall.  Their great song ""Heigh Ho"" is a marvelous introduction for them.This Blu-Ray edition of the film preserves the look of its original artwork while heightening some color and motion aspects.  For instance, Snow White's journey through the forest with the animals is subtly visually improved by the color pallette the Blu-Ray format affords.A minor complaint is that Snow White's prince is one of two of the most boring princes in Disney's fairytale movie catalogue(the prince from ""Cinderella"" is the other one).  However, Walt Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is a perfect classic in all other respects."	5.0	"Seventy-four years later, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is still Disney's best animated film"	2011-01-01	4	4	0

The package includes 2 Blu()-Ray() discs, and a standard DVD format copy of the filmWithout question one of the best additions to a DVD release to come along, DisneyView is a real treat. While perhaps not adding tremendously in general, though seeing the movie in the expanded aspect is rather nice, it is simply awe-inspiring to watch this view and wonder at the effort and talent that went into creating it.The Blu-ray treatment does in fact help animation contrary to the impressions of a few who think it's only for big budget blockbusters. Snow White's colors are enriched in the process and the audio has been cleared to perfection of any scratches or distortion - a common issue for older animated films.Also, with this combo pack, you can opt for the experience your home theatre allows. With both discs, you can experience the film with a restored original mono soundtrack...intriguing for purists, but for me, you have to go with one of the digital surround blu-ray, a brand new uncompressed DTS 7.1 offering.On the Blue-ray, the Magic Mirror is your host, taking you through all of the movie and even offering recommendations of what to do next. There are several games including, Jewel Jumble and Dopey's Wild Mine Ride.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AQ4JZJK850WH5	"Horror Bob ""Horrorreview.com"""	"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the film that put Disney on the map when it came to animated movies. In fact, many people consider it the film that changed the way animation was shown in theaters. It was the first film that Walt Disney produced; it was the first full-length cell-animated feature, as well as being the first animated film shown in American theaters, It was also the first produced in color and the first to be considered a Walt Disney classic.The story is based on a much darker tale written in Germany by the Brothers Grimm.  Walt Disney, however, turned the idea into the fairy tale story that it is today and added certain elements to detail that were not included in the Brothers Grimm story.  The story Disney tells is one of a princess named Snow White whose wicked stepmother, the Queen, has dressed her in servants' clothes and put her to work cleaning the castle. One day, when the Queen's Magic Mirror tells the Queen that she is no longer the fairest in the land, the Queen asks a hunter to take Snow White into the forest, kill her, and bring her heart back to the Queen. However, instead of doing as the queen requests, the hunter tells Snow White to run into the forest and to ""never come back."" He then brings the heart of a pig to the Queen to cover his tracks. However, the Magic Mirror tells the Queen that Snow White is still alive and living in the forest with the seven dwarfs. The Queen then descends into her dungeon where she practices black magic and turns herself into an old crone.  She also makes a poison apple, which she plans to give to Snow White. This apple will make Snow White sleep forever, and only the kiss of a price can reverse the curse.It has been decades since I last watched Snow White as a child. I vaguely remember catching pieces of the film here and there on VHS while my sisters stared at the television being sucked into the film's imaginary world. It is not until no, that I realize what a great animated film Snow White really is.  For a film that was produced in 1937, you would expect there to be an issue with the overall quality of the film on Blu-ray. While it still has the classical animated look to its characters, on Blu-ray, Snow White becomes a film like no other.With the Diamond edition Blu-ray combo pack Disney, does the fans right.  The film not only comes on a Blu-ray Disc, but a DVD as well.  I do not know how Disney did it, but the 1080p High Definition/1.33:1 transfer looks flawless. The restoration is unbelievable.  All the details of the film come to life, the picture quality is so crisp, and clear, you almost feel as if you are experiencing the film for the first time.The three-disc Diamond Edition has  a ton of special features. The DVD disc comes with the full-length version of the film with an all new digital restoration with enhanced picture and sound as well as the original and restored theatrical soundtrack. There is also audio commentary with animator John Canemaker. It also includes a music video and a sneak peak at the new Disney animated film The Princess and the Frog.The Blu-ray Disc features come on two separate discs. The first disc has the film in its newly transferred version in HD 7.1 Sound and all. There are also Music video and a Disneyview, which is an expanded experience where you can see things about the film that you never have before.  The features are divided into three categories on the disc. The first is the ""Disney Family Play"" which includes three games such as ""What did you see,"" a scrambled image in which you have to decipher and guess what you are seeing. ""Mirror, Mirror on the Wall,"" where the mirror will determine which Disney Princess you are most like. There is also a matching game called Jewel Jumble. The Backstage Disney features include a slew of things, which include three featurettes, and a sneak peak at the new Disney princess animated film, The Princess and the Frog. The first featurette, Snow White Returns, shows newly-discovered storyboards that suggest that Walt Disney planned a sequel for Snow White. There is also a featurette titled Hyperion Studios which gives a tour of Disney's original studio and the featurette The One that Started it All, where we learn how the film launched the Disney name in movies and how, as a film, Snow White changed the movie-going experience and paved the way for feature-length animated films. There are also the classic bonus features that include the game Dopey's Wild Mine Ride, ""Heigh-Ho"" a karaoke sing along and a Disney though the Decades feature and more.While this disc is sure to become a big-seller for the Christmas season, I do want to warn parents that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs does have a few things that might scare some younger viewers. This includes such scenes as when the hunter is about to stab Snow White, but instead tells her to run into the forest. When she runs into the forest, all the trees and plants around her turn into monsters and seem to be are after her. There is also the wicked Queen who is into black magic and turns herself into the hideous witch with the poison apples.  I think Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is best suited for children over the age of five or six. As a parent, you must judge if you think some of these scenes are too scary for your young ones. My two-year-old daughter laughed at the scenes, but for some more sensitive kids, this might be an issue.When you think Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, you think Disney. On Blu-ray disc this film looks phenomenal. It is probably the best-produced Blu-ray disc I have had the pleasure of reviewing. No one does it like Disney, and that is the truth.  The disc is truly a must-have for all fans of not only Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but for fans of the entire Disney brand."	5.0	Review from Bob at Parental Site for Diamond Edition Blu-ray DVD Combo pack.	2009-10-03	4	4	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2J6TSVD93XBS1	hunter's mom	We received an advance copy of the Diamond Edition set on October 2nd (this is the one that is released on Oct 6, 2009). The set includes a blue ray copy of the movie, a dvd copy of the movie, and bonus material of the movie on a blue ray. So far we have only watched the 2 movie copies. The case is very cute and has beautiful artwork. From what i understand there are two different covers. I have the Snow White cover. Inside the case you will find a blue ray guide that tells about the restoration of the movie, a scene selection guide, and what's on the bonus disc including minidocumentaries from 1937 of the making of this wonderful movie.When you put in the disc and get to the play menu its very cute. The magic mirror appears and seems to know that its the first time you are playing the disc and welcomes you to your first time to the show. When you play it again he mentions that you came back for more. And if you stop playing the movie in the middle and come back later he seems to know that as well. My 6 year old thought that was just the coolest thing ever! The movie was restored beautifully and didn't look at all like the vhs version that i remember from when i was a child. Also there is an option to watch the movie in Disney View. Which shows custom artwork of movie curtains in the sidebars. Its very cute.These days kids seem to want movies to start into the action right away and this movie does start off kinda slow so it was a bit hard for my kids in the start to sit there to watch it. But once the Dwarfs came in they were ready to watch with open eyes and ears. Its quite convenient that it comes with both the blue ray and dvd copies. I put the dvd copy upstairs for the kids to watch and left the blue ray copy downs stairs. This set is a must for anyone parent of anyone who loves Snow White. The kids are already asking to watch it again--for the 3rd day in a row!	5.0	Fantastic Restoration of Snow White	2009-10-04	1	1	0

The movie is a milestone in animation and it was the first full length animated movie ever made in the US. If you don't want to know the plot of the story skip some of the following sentences. The story is basically this: Once upon a time there lived a girl named Snow White who lived in the castle of her stepmother, The Wicked Queen. The Queen was extremely vain and would always consult her mirror about whether she was the most beautiful woman in the land and as usual the mirror says she is the most beautiful. But then one day he claims that Snow White is the most beautiful and this infuriates the Queen. She hires a huntsman to cut out Snow White's heart and when it comes time to do the job the huntsman cannot do it so he lets Snow White run away into the dark forest. Eventually she finds a cottage in the woods which belongs to seven dwarfs who decide to take her in. But when the Queen discovers Snow White is still alive she decides to go to the cottage in disguise to kill her with a poison apple and that's as far as i go with the synopsis. Even thought it might not be as sophisticated as today's animation, the animation in this movie is very beautiful. The characters are very well animated. The movie also has some fun songs as well like &quot;Heigh Ho&quot;, &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot;, etc. While this may be targeted towards kids it is in essence a scary story on their terms. The part of the movie about the poison apple is basically telling kids don't accept things from or talk to strangers. The voices are well done and the music score is very beautiful. One thing though: this movie may turn off some feminists. It is somewhat anti-feminist but the movie is so good that no one might care. As an added note this movie made the AFI's top 100 movies list. So sit back and enjoy Walt Disney's masterpiece.	5.0	SNOW WHITE is the best of all the disney movies!	2001-08-14	3	2	1
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A319SKSB556033	"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews"""	"Walt Disney's first full length feature, animated, and in color, is now regarded as a classic above criticism. Well, while it is a huge achievement, especially for 1937, it IS a little thin on story.Set in a European-esque fairytale world, Snow White is the pretty young Princess living under the shadow of her evil stepmother the Queen. Envious of her beauty she orders her huntsman to lead her out into the woods and cut her heart out. He gets the first bit right, but chickens out on the actual heart-cutting. Instead he banishes her to the woods where she promptly invades a private home, claiming it for herself, and enslaves the forest animals to do her bidding.When the rightful owners return they are first alarmed but then happy to have a woman living in the house to seize their passions and cook their dinners. I assume that all dishes served in Casa De Dwarf are all vegetarian since we never actually see Snowy kill, skin, and butcher the animals that she has enslaved.Eventually the Queen learns that Snowy is still alive and aims to kill her with a poisoned apple (that can be reversed by a kiss from her true love). Why she doesn't just slit her throat or burn the house down is beyond me.There are not really enough developments in the story to maintain the 83-minute running time, with a lot of space devoted to singing and rhythm-timed animation in the style of Silly Symphonies. But the animation, and especially the backgrounds, are wonderful to look at and really do create an atmospheric, beautiful world. It's a shame Disney didn't indulge in them more.Still a classic, but perhaps a little too quaint from a modern point-of-view.The Blu-ray presents the movie in a 1.34:1 1080p aspect ratio that is almost completely flawless and makes it look like it was drawn yesterday. There is an optional ""Disney-View"" feature that fills in the empty space left by the window-boxing with appropriate animated framing. It is not intrusive. There is not a single pop or hiss in the restored DTS HD-MA 7.1 sound either. A MASSIVE amount of extra features are included."	4.0	I prefer 'em tanned	2001-10-10	12	11	1

It's obvious that Disney spent a lot of time and money turning this classic into a high-def film. But they did not re-do any artwork. It has the look and feel of the original, just sharper than I've ever seen it.This package is an excellent value as it comes with 3 DVDs: Two BluRay (one with the video and the other with extras) and one standard DVD. I really appreciate it when they add the standard DVD so I'm not tied to a high-def player. I can throw the original in an old DVD player or a computer, and even the standard DVD looks better than ever.Disney would have been justified (and probably would have sold plenty) at a standard BluRay DVD price, but as of the time of this posting, pricing was much lower than most new release BluRay discs, plus they threw in the bonus disc and the standard DVD.If this is any indication of how Disney will roll out all of their classic cartoons into High Def, I'm excited.	5.0	I'm Excited For Disney To Do This for All Their Classic Cartoons	2009-11-09	0	0	0

Disney is releasing Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition, a fun combo pack of a DVD and Blue-ray with special features.Originally released in 1937, as the very first animated feature film, it helped spur every little girl's fantasy of being a princess and finding her prince.  Of course, that included my little princess, who had never seen Snow White until One2One Network sent us the Diamond Edition to review (Yes, I should be labeled an evil Queen for not making sure she'd watched it before now.  I mean she is already four...lol).There is a reason that it's a classic, and won an Academy Award (including an extra 7 ""dwarf"" Oscars!) in 1939.  It still has the power to enthrall and makes us shiver at the witch, even after all these years.In my opinion, this is one where the extras make all the difference.  On the Blue-ray, the Magic Mirror is your host, taking you through all of the movie and even offering recommendations of what to do next.  There are several games including, Jewel Jumble and Dopey's Wild Mine Ride.  We didn't get a chance yet, to try Scene Stealer, which uploads a picture and inserts it on the face of a dwarf in the movie.  Finally, my son's favorite extra was Tiffany Thornton's music video of ""Some Day My Prince Will Come.""  Most tweener parents will recognize her from Disney's Sonny with a Chance.  We also didn't have time to watch the featurette, Snow White Returns, that would have been similar to a sequel, if it had been released.This was a lot of fun, brought back a lot of memories, and definitely made some new ones!  Hubby had never seen this before and loved getting to watch his little princess enjoy it.

The movie itself has never looked nor sounded better, but it is the extras that are worth the price.  The interactive Magic Mirror is fantastic - taking even the novice to numerous things to explore.  The game really tests the viewers ability to recall even minute details of the film - who actually knows which instrument each Dwarf plays  The background materials provided fascinating tidbits about everything from abandoned concepts to info about the voice talents.  I never knew that the voice of the prince was the father of Dean Stockwell who played &quot;Al&quot; on Quantum Leap.  I really enjoyed the walk through time provided by some of Disney's best actors, but where was Dame Julie?  But the creme de la creme was Barbra's beautiful rendition of &quot;Some Day My Prince will Come.&quot;  I can't wait until the next DVD in the series (Beauty and the Beast) is introduced next year since the nearest IMAX screen is in Chicago.	5.0	A BRILLIANT START TO THE PLATINUM SERIES	2002-02-04	0	0	0

And I will say this:  The film itself is oviously an incredible accomplishment for the time.  There are certain scenes where you can tell the animators and Disney himself overlooked no detail.  (The scenes in which the Dwarfs and Snow White look through the cottage with candle light...they did an exceptional job on cast shadows and such.)However, the &quot;extras&quot; featured on this dvd, while there are TONS AND TONS of them...I think are just...well...not great.  It's basically an earfull of &quot;Why we at Disney are splendid&quot; hubbub with &quot;celebrity hosts.&quot;  (Most of whom I'd never even heard of nor seen before.)The &quot;Disney through the ages&quot; aspect was the part that I found most offensive.  They just went on and on about how great Disney is decade by decades conveniently skipping the flops. (The Black Cauldron anyone?) I think it would have been MUCH more interesting had they not sugar coated their history and just stuck to the facts.So, overall...a pretty cool DVD.  I just gotta say I don't think it's as perfect as everyone is saying it is.Just my 2 cents.  I could be wrong.	3.0	Force Fed a Classic	2001-10-14	19	8	11
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K	"Jared Castle ""Oregon writer"""	"My review answers a simple question: is the Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo worth $20? Are you getting enough for your entertainment dollar? The answer is...yes.I say this with caution for two reasons. The first is that, while Snow White is inarguably a classic, the story's pacing is very, very slow. Children raised on Pixar films likeThe Incredibles,Finding Nemo,CarsandRatatouillemight not share their parents' fondness for Snow White. To be fair, most entertainment from 1937 cannot help but show its age more than 70 years later.The second reason for my cautious endorsement is that most of the extra features included in this package are of greater interest to parents instead of their children. So, do not be surprised if your child asks to leave the room after the movie ends while you stay behind, watching the ""Disney Through The Decades"" featurette or Don Hahn's nearly seven-minute discussion about the film's exposure sheet.In summary, for your entertainment dollar, this is a good investment. Just do not be surprised if it takes repeat viewings (and a little more maturity) before your children call it one of their favorites. Rating: Five stars."	5.0	Still a classic, but the slower pace may surprise your kids	2009-11-12	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3TTSOJM3X1U8S	Jasmine T. Baer	"I won't bother to summarize the story of Snow White.  It is the classic fairy tale with a beautiful maiden, gallant prince, and evil queen.This 2-disc set contains a depth of additional information that I found fascinating.  First, the restoration of the movie is incredible.  Disc 2 has a feature called the ""Restoration,"" and it details how new technology enabled Disney to clean up and refresh Snow White from the original film.  The piece contains a side-by-side comparison of the cleaned up version versus the original.  Absolutely stunning!Other interesting supplemental materials from the 2nd Disc include ""Abandoned Concepts,"" ""Disney Through the Decades,"" ""Storyboard to Film Comparisons,"" and other well-done pieces of information.This DVD truly is the total package.  The movie itself is timeless, and the supplemental material teaches you everything you've ever wanted to know about Disney animation and the creation of, and restoration of Snow White.  What truly struck me as something that sets it apart from other good ""special editions"" is the DVD's documentation.  The DVD's guide details each feature on both discs.  This saves time trying to navigate via the DVD.  Just find out what you want to watch, and cut to it via your DVD player.  Terrific!This ""total package"" is a wonderful way to begin a Disney DVD collection."	5.0	Awesome 2-Disc Set!	2002-04-20	6	6	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AOVJYIUATQKR5	JediMack	After much discussion our family ranked this Disney classic as their 6th favorite out of the 41 cartoon based movies we own.  Of all the old classic cartoons, SWAT7D probably contributed for to the Walt Disney World theme park than any other movie.  Snow White herself, the most evil bad guy, the step mother witch, the 7 dwarfs, the diamond mine, the poison apple and the mirror on the wall are all familiar pictures in the culture even today.Some had said this is their favorite family movie and I can't blame them.  We only gave 7 of the 41 a 5 star rating, what we called the magnificent 7.  But, Mirror mirror on the wall, which is the best Disney movie of all?  The debate was fun.We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work. All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad. Peter Pan is no Codfish, we rank it #2. Lion King was selected number 1 of the 41 as the family favorite, but narrowly. Peter Pan was 2. Pete's Dragon 3, Beauty &amp; the beast 4 and Sleeping Beauty 5.	5.0	Mirror mirror on the wall, which is the best Disney movie?	2003-08-10	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A96BZ4IPSAWB5	jenmb	It is easy to get used to the vibrant colors of BD, but I didn't think they would be able to make such an old movie look so good.  We had been watching this movie on an old VHS, and then I decided to purchase the blu-ray edition.  I was shocked at how washed out and old the colors really were on the VHS we had been watching.  It was like watching a whole new movie.  The detail and eye catching colors were wonderful. It just reinforced that Walt Disney was a genius. There is even an option to watch it with curtains to each side of the screen.  That's kind of gimmicky, but is kinda cool (I can appreciate good gimmick sometimes). I do want to mention that for those of you who haven't watched this movie in a long time.....beware the scary scenes when the hunter and Snow White are in the woods.  Snow Whites run through the woods is really quite scary.  If your child is very little or scares easily you might want to skip this part of the movie (just watch it yourself first to decide).  My 2 1/2 year old little girl got a scared by it the first time we watched it on VHS and it's even more vivid on the BD edition (it had been years since I had seen it and I didn't think about it scaring her).  I felt so guilty!	5.0	Amazing colors.....	2011-01-27	2	2	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1XSXUBCNFIM3W	Jim Jr	This DVD package is the reason DVDs are in existance. It is an absolutely amazing 2 disk set. I took my VHS copy of &quot;Snow White&quot; and compared scenes with those on the DVD and there is no comparison. The picture, the sound, everything is so much better, clearer and sharper than the VHS - which was itself, wonderful. If someone does not have a DVD, viewing Snow White would casuse them to run, not walk to the nearest store to buy one.SNOW WHITE is a cinimatic masterpiece. There will never be another animated film to compare to it, even my other Disney favorite &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. If it had been made today, there would be computer generated features like shadows and contours of features, but they would not make that much difference in what is basically wonderful.Compare &quot;Snow White&quot; to the animated &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; that was releasted two years later in answer to the Disney film and it is clear how far superior Disney's work is to other animators and story tellers.There is so much in the 2 disk set beyond the actual film that it would be impossible to comment on all of it. Each segment amplifies and explains the film. Even in some of the games, you learn more about the story and the viewer can appreciate it even more from these features. The cut scenes, the unfinished segments, the character developments, the voice auditions are fascinating. As an adult, after watching these extras, you will have a deeper appreciation of what the film is and how extraordinary the accomplishments are. For a film buff or student it is required viewing.I grew up with &quot;Snow White&quot;. I was a small child when it was first released and one of my first memories of seeing a movie is of &quot;Snow White&quot;. I had Snow White toys - would you believe a Dopey ventriloquist doll (I have never been able to figure out why a vent figure was made of a character who never talks) that I still have. When I became a professional puppeteer, &quot;Snow White&quot; became my favorite show to do. Naturally, I had to change parts because of Disney copyrights, so I have a rather complete knowledge of the story from research for my show and from years of seeing the Disney film. Without question, Disney is the BEST and now the DVD is the best of the best.	5.0	MAGNIFICENT DVD deserves 10 stars	2001-10-14	0	0	0

What a perfect time for this edition to come out. It is so great, the colors and details are so clear and rich, while maintaining the integrity of this classic film. I can't say enough good things about it and consider myself very lucky to have been chosen to receive a sneek peek for this movie. This is a perfect movie for the young and the young at heart.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ	J. Michael Click	Think you've seen this film before?  Well, so did I ... once in a movie theatre in the 1960's, then again on VHS and LaserDisc in the 1990's.  But after viewing this Platinum Edition on DVD, I now realize that in truth, I have only seen pale imitations of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; in the past!  That's how incredible this newly restored animated classic looks on DVD. Never before has the picture looked so crisp, clean, and gorgeous in vivid three-strip Technicolor; never before has the soundtrack offered such an amazing range of clarity.  All the critical superlatives that have become cliches through overuse genuinely apply here: the video and sound transfers are dazzling! amazing! breathtaking! exquisite!  If you, like I, have in the past respected the film mainly for its historical importance as Walt Disney's first full-length animated feature, prepare to reappreciate it as a phenomenal visual experience.As if the feature were not more than enough, the Disney Company has gone all-out in packaging the DVD with a plethora of bonus features that will appeal to a broad range of viewers.  There are a &quot;sing-along&quot; for the tykes; a video game for the kids; deleted concepts and original storyboard drawing for the film buffs; and much, much, much more.  Literally, I have spent over two hours exploring all the extra features, and still haven't experienced them all!  The two discs are delightfully  overwhelming, and represent an incredible value for your money.  This is one DVD package that is instantly a classic in - and of - itself, and a must-have for your home video collection!	5.0	Snow White and the Ten-Star DVD	2001-10-04	13	12	1

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2TTB3PRZ3K5NS	John J. Healey	"I probably saw this film as a child, but don't remember much about it.  Last night, as a middle aged adult, I watched it on Blu-ray.  It is now obvious to me why this film is held in such reverence.  The famous Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein said ""Snow White"" was the greatest film ever made.  He may be right.  This movie is a testament to the genius of Walt Disney.  Seeing it on Blu-ray is an incredible experience.  The color, video, and sound quality are nothing less then phenomenal for a film made in 1937.  It is obvious the Disney company lovingly remastered the video and audio, and did a spectacular job at it.  ""Snow White"" is much more than a movie, it is art at the highest level.  It was a groundbreaking acheivement when it was created, being the first feature length animated film, and its magic is timeless, like all great art.You may have seen this movie as a child but you haven't really seen it until you're an adult.  Needless to say, I plan on purchasing many more Disney classics on Blu-ray.  Highly recommended!"	5.0	Timeless Masterpiece	2011-01-31	4	4	0

You know the plot; you know the characters; but now you'll know the entire history behind the film, the characters, the original layouts for the Dwarfs, Snow White, the wicked queen, the witch, the dwarfs' cottage, (actually seeing the original, completely different drawings for Snow White and the Dwarfs is WAY cool) and much, MUCH more.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AVR3F6VQYIMZW	Joseph Tidline	Snow White is a film that has been released numerous times on various formats. So after awhile you have to stop and wonder, is it possible for them to come up with anything new. Well it's Disney, and the answer is yes. Yet again Disney has put another top notch release. This set is packed with great bonus features. One that stands out is Snow White Returns where Disney found old storyboards for what could have been a possible sequel. We may never know. But the real star of this release is the picture quality. Making it's first appearance on Blu-ray, Snow White looks absolutely amazing. I purchased Snow White back when it first hit VHS and again when it first came out on DVD and dare I say that it looks even better now, than when it was first released in theaters over 70 years ago. They say you can't improve upon perfection, well someone forgot to tell that to Walt Disney.

Blame DISNEY itself for that, since in the past 20 years, the studio has released equally timeless tales that far exceed this film's technical qualities.  Nowhere here will you find the depth and 3-dimensional elements of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; or the sheer grandeur of &quot;The Lion King.&quot;  And, SNow White's operatic vocal inflections can be grating at times, I admit.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3VI2VETB90ZG5	J. Sullivan	I didn't think animated features would benefit from a high definition transfer, but it turns out they do.This Blu-ray Diamond Edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves adds enough resolution to the film to make it seem as though we're leering just over the actual sequence of cels, allowing us to see the quality of the hand drawn images as if we're looking right at them. Small details aren't muttled into an averaged pixel representation - you see all the small details in their original glory.The audio quality is truly superb. Disney must have kept their original audio masters in outstanding condition. The clarity and fidelity of the sound completely masks the age of the film. It sounds like a recent release (unlike another clean, but distant-sounding 70th anniversary product that just released with a watch) - they've done a fantastic job with the multi-track audio.Are the visual and audio improvements astonishing? Let me say it's enough to add a certain charm to the film that had not been apparent in previous home-viewing formats. It's very captivating to watch this presentation in its storybook form, from start to finish, it's just magic. There is no jaw-dropping difference to where you might be majorly missing out on anything, but this is the best presentation available and it is worth its price for this historically significant gem of a film.	5.0	Snow White on Blu-ray - Excellent	2009-10-11	3	2	1

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2R164STV36F6C	Julian Pope	Disney has undoubtedly produced some of the most successful and memorable classic animated films of all time. Ever since it's first feature, the immortalized Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, made its debut in 1937 the company became unstoppable releasing classic after classic. But it all started with Snow White. Beautifully animated, well composed songs, an innocent heroine and a terrifying villainess. This movie first made kids, and adults, fall in love with Disney's animation and the film itself, both wanting to see the movie again and again. To say that over the past 75+ years the film has just survived would be a serious understatement. Through all this time there is still an audience for it, whether it's children of the 2000's seeing it for the first time, their parents who grew up with the film on VHS or even their grandparents who saw the films first run in theaters. There's just something about the feel of the film that makes you at home, which is exactly the way the late great Mr. Walt Disney would want us to feel watching the film. Having said all this the new wave (since the mid 90's) of Disney Pixar films are great, but sometimes people just forget how good traditional Disney animation is.	5.0	The First and The Best	2012-12-26	1	1	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A28OB1QLXN5BM6	"Karen Joan ""Siren"""	"A few evenings ago, I had the great pleasure of introducing my four year old daughter to Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE.  Let me tell you, SNOW WHITE is still a true classic - beautiful, charming, and quite amazing even all these years later.  And the joy of sharing it with my wee one made it even more special.I don't think that I have seen SNOW WHITE in probably close to 40 years.  While I remember the basic story - who doesn't? - there are many snippets and scenes that I had forgotten.  Watching this latest, lovely version with my daughter snuggled in my lap, the forgotten scenes and songs came flooding back, and my daughter and I found ourselves singing along together.  The music of SNOW WHITE clearly crosses the generations with ease.  Old favorites, such ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" and ""Heigh Ho,"" sail across the years and are as fun and memorable as ever.  My little princess was entranced by this film, and, I have to admit, so was I.It is astonishing to realize that SNOW WHITE was released in 1937, and that it was Disney's first full length animated feature film.  The story, the art, the animation, and the music have all stood the test of time, and still rank near the top with the best of the Disney films.  This latest version is bright and sharp; quite simply, it is exquisite.Everyone born after 1937 was basically raised on SNOW WHITE.  I am so glad that Disney has rereleased it for yet another generation.  I can just picture great-grandmothers, grandmothers, mothers, aunts, daughters, and sisters all sitting down together to watch this movie, introducing it to the latest little princess in the family.  And that, most certainly, is the true definition of a classic family film."	5.0	Even More Breathtaking Than Remembered	2009-10-16	1	1	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A24TCT2CY6KY68	"Katherine Petersdorf ""Author, Film Producer &..."	Honestly, I'm not a fan of Snow White. I like the story of Snow White just fine, however, I wasn't fond of the re-telling done by Disney. I have a few things about it that I couldn't stand that made me not like it.1.) Focus of the DwarfsI felt like the focus on the Dwarfs for so much of the story wasn't pleasant. I much preferred other versions in which there was more romance  or a back story of love. I also like stories in which the Dwarfs are more character driven and less a fixation of a single trait2.) The Lack of Reasonable RomanceThere wasn't a back story or a reasoning valid other than beauty for the prince falling in love with her, and that bothered me. I must prefer it when the retelling of Snow White has them engaged already, that the Prince is the son of the Queen and he loves her and shouldn't or the queen fears the loss of her crown instead of he finds her and kisses her.3.) Her VoiceWhen she sings I want to claw my ears off because her voice is so high, so very high pitched. I wish she was cured like Ariel and couldn't speak, then I might enjoy the movie.I've only seen this movie twice in my life, once to see it, and the second time because I was a family member's house and had no vote in the matter.	2.0	I'm Not a Snow White Fan	2013-12-17	2	1	1

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2CEJG5IJ5V2UN	"Kayla Lynn Gehringer ""Jane Doe"""	A wonderful film full of charm and wit. Disney's first ever princess that started the entire Princess line stars in Snow White. The story veers off from the darker counterparts and doesn't include Snow's mother like the traditional stories do, rather it plunges you into the depths of the stepmother's rivalry with Snow White for the title of most beautiful. Each attempt on the Queen's part to kill Snow White fails until the apple, whose poisoned cheek sends the poor girl through a ringer.Snow White is a naive child, being bred in the palace, and she doesn't quite comprehend all the dangers around her. This is both a weakness of hers, as well as a strength that makes her lovable. As a feminist, I think that she teaches girls a valuable lesson: looks aren't everything and be careful who you take candy from. Snow White has a happy ending, but that's all I'm saying because you really have to watch it yourself to experience it.	5.0	Fantastic Disney's First Princess!	2010-02-28	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AYPS4RCXEFSJP	K. Boullosa	"Along with ""Bambi"" and ""Pinocchio"", ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" represents the cream of the first crop of full-length animated stories (as opposed to ""Fantasia"", which was not a story) that the Disney studio brought out between 1939 and 1962.  The other efforts from that era included ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Peter Pan"", ""Dumbo"", ""Cinderella"", and ""Sleeping Beauty"".  Although each of these last five films have considerable charms to recommend them, as entire works they do not quite reach the levels of beauty, artistry, and memorability of Snow White, Bambi, and Pinocchio.  Snow White was the first of those story films, and its enchantment has not faded with age and modernity.  From the first frame, the viewer is carried away to a created world filled with a wide range of characters, all of whom are fully developed, from the smallest bird to the Wicked Queen, not to mention each of the seven dwarves, all with their own distinct personalities, voices, expressions, and traits.  The film is exquisitely beautiful to look at, with a softness and delicacy of tint lacking in later computer efforts.  The musical score, as was also the case with Bambi, is nearly symphonic in reach if not depth, the voices are closer to operatic quality than Broadway belting, and, of course, the score contains the legendary ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"", tenderly sung by Andrea Caselotti.  Some of the darker moments are truly frightening, such as when Snow White flees terrified into the forest after the Huntsman tells her of the Queen's hatred, and the transformation of the Wicked Queen into the old woman with her basket of apples.  Others moments remain amazingly moving, as when the forest creatures weep outside the cottage windows in the rain as they look in on the seemingly dead Snow White after she swallows the poisoned apple.  The tears slide down their faces as the rain slides down the windowpanes, merging into nature's expression of muted sorrow.It's not easy to identify the reasons why some of these animated Disney story films succeeded better than others - later efforts also paid careful attention to character development, had catchy tunes, and were pretty to look at.  Yet some of the films have an indefinable magic that others do not, and for some reason, these tend to be among the stuido's earliest efforts. For example, the later ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a nice film and also utilizes Tchaikovsky's gorgeous ballet music, yet it simply lacks the charm that characterizes Snow White.  ""Peter Pan"" is also fun to watch, but Disney himself viewed it as a failure, as lacking ""heart"" and failing to capture the wistfulness of J.M. Barrie's original story.Only ""Bambi"", from the 1950s, equals Snow White in the power to move deeply, and even surpasses it in sheer beauty - some of the original cels from Bambi look like Monet paintings.  Pinocchio approaches and nearly catches these two in beauty and certainly is their equal in hand-created animation artistry.  In the early part of Pinocchio, the downward spiralling views of the little town, all the different clocks in Gepetto's shop going off at once, and Gepetto's legs showing through his nightgown when he dances in front of the fireplace, represent the pinnacle of hand-drawn animation achievement, before computers took over.Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" remains enchanted and enchanting, one of the greatest hand-animated stories ever to come to the screen.  Disney ran out of funds before it was quite completed and had to talk his bankers into giving him more money to finish the work.  Fortunately, ""Snow White"" was an instant success, justifying Disney's faith in his creation, saving the Disney studio from banktruptcy, and paving the way for its later works.  Along with Bambi and Pinocchio, Snow White is a must for the serious collector."	5.0	Simply Magical	2008-01-02	2	2	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3U41ZL33SS92P	"Kevin Nicholls ""jaded, aging hipster"""	"Disney decided to throw almost everything in to this collection, which makes this a must-have for the Snow White fan. However, for the casual viewer, the Blu-Ray treatment might not be the best value around.As the description says, you get a total of three discs here. I have to applaud Disney for including a DVD version for taking along in the car, or putting in your child's room. The extras disc is jam-packed with bonuses, if you're a devout fan of Snow White or early Disney films, or if you're looking to show off BD Live features.The feature disc is quite good. The image quality is probably the best it can be, given Snow White's age. The movie is presented in 4:3 format, with the option of having art displayed where you'd normally see black bars. If you turn the feature on, the artwork is unintrusive for the most part, however, there are some scenes where it blends so well with the picture, it can be distracting. (One notable scene is when Snow White is running through a forest, and appears to run in to a tree.)While the feature has been restored and remastered, I personally would have liked some more attention paid to the soundtrack. The sound quality is excellent, but I would have liked a more prominent surround mix -- possibly as an alternate audio track, and the original track retained for purists.All things considered, though, if you just want to watch Snow White, the Blu-Ray version doesn't really offer huge advances over the DVD version. For many, it's a ""might as well"" decision if you already have a Blu-Ray library started. But if you're new to Blu-Ray, you may want to skip over this one and opt for the DVD version."	4.0	Mostly For Collectors	2009-10-13	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AO461REE0KA4J	keviny01	Disney's first &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; DVD is a terrific 2-disc set that every DVD fan should keep for all eternity.  (I received an early, free copy from Amazon which allowed me to review it before the Oct 9th release date.  This is a promotion by both Amazon and Buena Vista.)  The THX-certified video transfer of the movie is blemish-free, almost always sharp, and has only an occasional softness perhaps due to age.  Colors look splendid.  The sound is clean and without a scratch, although some dialogs lack detail.  The 5.1 audio remix provides mildly effective separation and bass for the background music.  Otherwise, it is neither better nor worse than the included original mono soundtrack.The supplements on the first disc includes a 40-minute retrospective documentary that actually serves as a nice introduction of the supplements on the second disc.  For nearly every aspect mentioned in the documentary, the extras on the second disc cover at length.  There is an audio commentary track by historian John Canemaker that includes contemporary recordings of Walt reminiscing about the difficulties and fortunes during the making of the film.  The commentary reveals that Deanna Durbin was once considered for the voice of Snow White, but she was deemed &quot;too old&quot;.  Canemaker, besides introducing each of Walt's recordings, also provides excellent scene-by-scene analyses.  After the movie is over, Michael Eisner introduces Barbara Streisand's decidedly more mature rendition of &quot;Somewhere My Prince Will Come&quot;.  The first disc also includes four games -- two for set-top players, two as DVD-ROM content.The second disc contains a large amount of archival material of the movie.  There are over 400 stills (all high-quality scans) of pencil tests, backgrounds, layouts, character designs, photos of the voice talents, photos of the production, the premiere, the 1937 pressbook, merchandise, and posters.  There are quite a bit of video content as well.  Notable is a new, nicely conceived, 40-minute segment called &quot;Disney Through the Years&quot;; it chronicles SNOW WHITE's theatrical releases in every decade (all trailers are shown) as well as Disney's accomplishments through the years.  There are the original credit sequences with the RKO logo.  There are deleted scenes that were fully animated and dubbed, one of which is a spectacular soup-eating scene.  There are scenes that were conceptualized but were abandoned before animation, such as a dream sequence for one of Snow White's songs.  There is a segment about the film's restorations in 1987, '93, and 2001.  There are also vintage video of voice actors, models for live action references, techniques used in animation (two excerpts of Disney's &quot;Tricks of our Trade&quot; TV show are included).And there is more!  There is a half-hour live radio broadcast of the film's premiere in which many celebrities are interviewed.  There is another half-hour radio program in 1938 in which several songs from the movie are performed.  There are two 4-minute radio interviews of Walt Disney by Cecil B. DeMille, one of which was recorded on the eve of the premiere.  There are eight radio commercials from the 50s and 60s.  There are recordings of two deleted songs, one of which, we are told, were only recently discovered in Disney's archives.  There are also text screens about the film's production and Walt's life and career.  A nice inclusion is the English translation of the Grimms Brothers' &quot;Snow White.&quot;Future Platinum Edition DVDs will include BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, ALADDIN, THE LION KING, BAMBI, THE JUNGLE BOOK, CINDERELLA, THE LITTLE MERMAID, LADY AND THE TRAMP and 101 DALMATIANS.  It disappoints me that DUMBO will not be a Platinum Edition (it will come out Oct 21st as a &quot;Gold Edition&quot; DVD).  It irks me even more that only one Platinum Edition DVD will be sold each year for only a limited time; thereafter it will be put on a TEN-YEAR moratorium.  This will no doubt lead to buying frenzies, so run, don't walk, to your nearest personal computer and order this SNOW WHITE DVD right away.  I do not oppose releasing one Platinum DVD per year, since I understand it takes time and care to produce these great discs.  But I do oppose Disney's long-standing policy of putting their video releases on moratorium for long, long periods.  Their rationale has been that if people own the movie on video, they may not want to see it in theaters.  Not true.  Seeing this spectacular SNOW WHITE DVD has actually increased my desire to see the film in a theater.	5.0	Timeless film; handsome DVD package	2001-10-09	37	33	4

Today we can't imagine the newness of SW&TSD; at its release seventy years ago: examples such as its length as an animated feature, its use of colors (1500 tints and shades were used), its use of song to advance the story (The Wizard of Oz went forward at least in part because of SW's success), its lifelike motion of characters (Snow White's dancing with Dopey was modeled on live-action dance footage), its technological firsts such as 3-D effects in the scenery, its subtilty in depiction of the human form.More deeply, SW&TSD; does what only a great film can: it captures your imagination and emotions. You forget it's a cartoon and really believe in the story. Grumpy is won over by Snow White and so are you. Moreso, the timeless qualities of the promise of hope, the triumph of good over evil, and the transcendence of the human spirit, to paraphrase historian J. Canemaker all flow out of this treasure.The scariest scenes might be a little much for the youngest kids, but for everyone else it's a must-see.The 2-disc Platinum edition gives a wealth of extras, including an audio commentary almost half-full of Walt Disney's spoken comments, deleted song and scenes, a sing-a-long, a game, and much more.Don't miss it!"	5.0	Masterpiece of Cinema and Animation--a Joy to Watch	2007-10-26	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A36AR6Z33M01AC	"K. Krach ""mom of type 1 son"""	"This Snow White is Loaded.....Now keep in mind that I viewed this DVD on a standard definition tv...I know, I know, what was I thinking.  The improvements in this film were remarkable to say the least.  The kids and I (ages 11 and 4) had watched the original version just prior to viewing the Diamond Edition so that we'd be able to note the differences.  Let me tell ya, no prior viewing was necessary.Right away you notice how much clearer the images are.  In the original you had a lot of blah colors and not a lot of line definition.  In the diamond edition the colors are crystal clear (even in standard def) and the images stand out a lot more.  At one point I recall telling the kids to pay close attention to the water....it actually looks like it is moving.  The images stand out in 3D.  Something I never though possible from a film of yesterday.  They really put a lot of time into recreating this masterpiece.  All while not ruining the classic image.  It was very tastefully done.Now I did notice things from time to time.  Mainly that the pixels are pretty visible where there is a lot of color concentrated in one place.  A good example is the seven dwarves outfits when they are crossing the bridge coming home from the mine and another incident when Snow White is in the woods with the huntsman.  But those are minor concerns when you see the awesome clearness in the scene where she is running through the woods afraid of all the eyes and creepy creatures.  They made major improvements in that part.The one thing great about the Diamond Edition is that not only do you get the regular full length feature film but also a 2 disk blue ray of it and bonus features.  And let me tell you....this thing is loaded to the max with bonuses.  You get a first look of the opening sequence of ""The Princess and the Frog"", a lot of behind the scenes footage (including a possible sequel that Walt was working on), music video of Tiffany Thornton, audio commentary, and they even throw in some games for the kiddos....or you : )Games are ""What do you see?"", ""Mirror, Mirror on the Wall"",  and ""Dopey's Wild Mine Ride"".Another great feature is the fact that it will remember where you stopped the movie at and make sure you can restart it from there next time you go to view it.  This feature comes in super handy when you have little ones with short attention spans....you know, like a typical four year old.In summary this movie is an excellent value for the entire family.  So what if you already own Snow White on VHS, it's time to update your collection.  And this is the perfect way to do so."	5.0	Snow White.......Loaded Edition!!!!	2009-10-06	4	3	1

However, it was NOT ""new"". There were no security sealings on the case which leads me to assume that it was opened. The wrapping on the case was not the original wrapping that comes on DVDs. It was a shrink wrap just like the kind we use at our college bookstore to wrap bundled textbooks. THEN, when we watched the movie, it constantly had a black box in the corner with a video camera picture in it. The box that usually comes on when you've copied from a DVD incorrectly.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR	"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl"""	"There are few if any words that I could possibly add to the veritable encyclopedias that have been written over the years about Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. Suffice it to say that it is the very first full length animated feature film ever made, that the gamble taken by Walt Disney paid off handsomely and the film in most respects was the catalyst for the expansion of his company into one of the biggest entertainment conglomerates in the world. The film spawned a whole new genre that has to a very large extent been the exclusive domain of the Walt Disney Company since 1937, and you only have to wander through the names of the memorable animated features that they have created to understand the impact they have had on family entertainment for the last sixty four years. Pinocchio, Bambi, Cinderella, Peter Pan, The Jungle Book, The Little Mermaid, Beauty And The Beast and The Lion King just to name a few of the many gems in their catalogue. And it all begin with Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. Somewhat pretentiously, the Walt Disney Company have always afforded the film the appellation of ""masterpiece"" for its infrequent theatrical and video releases, but if there is one film in their catalogue that does live up to that pretentious appellation then it is Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs.Like just about every reviewer in the world, I am not going to provide a plot synopsis, for the story is so well-known that there seems little point in rehashing it again. Suffice it to say that anyone of any age, other than those born since its last theatrical incarnation in 1993 and video release in 1994, is unlikely not to have seen the film or at the very least heard of the story. In our modern world, the story is incredibly simple and to some extent quite quaintly naive, but simplicity is often a wondrous thing, for it is that simplicity that keeps the crowds flocking back to see the film on its occasional theatrical releases and to add the video to the collection on its infrequent video releases.Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is a landmark film in every respect and is one of the true classics. Nothing more needs to be said other than to ask the question: has the DVD release done justice to the film? After eighteen hours of watching, listening and typing over six days, let me assure you that you are going to be buying one of the very best DVD packages we have ever seen, period."	5.0	A timeless film	2005-01-11	6	5	1
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2W9I628I6SE1U	"Kort ""Art, Music, Book & Movie Enthusiast"""	Okay, that may be dramatic, but drama is what Snow White is all about. The Diamond Edition of this Disney classic is simply wonderful. Say what you want about Disney adaptations of fairy tales from around the world, but this one was done right. You should all know the story by now, but seeing in it's fully restored and hi-def brilliance is like seeing it for the first time. Colors are saturated beautifully, animation is smooth and detailed (as it could be for the time) and the soundtrack is a joy to listen to. It is great that they include a DVD edition with the Blu-Ray, and there are some features on it, but most of the action is on the Blu-ray.  Extras abound and give you hours of viewing pleasure long after the movie has ended. The magic mirror feature is favorite, so eerie! So I can only assume the DVD is intended to be used in portable players where a Blu-ray may not work.If you are a fan of classic Disney animated movies, then this is a must have for your collection. Lovers of a good movie and it's historical perspective will find a lot to capture their interest as well. Every time my kids watch Snow White, I find myself getting swept up in it too.

Ross ""Kristy"""	Disney's first foray into full-length feature animation was unsurprisingly measured a risky move for the studio that were best known for short Mickey Mouse and Sillie Symphony cartoons. But thankfully, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was acknowledged with critical eulogize and box office achievement, prompting the studio to continue making feature-length caricatures. This is an essential chapter in movie-making history, with so many amazing features; it really does define the word `classic'. One of my much treasured Disney movies, Snow White has all the staple ingredients for archetypal animation: a great story, fantastic animation, catchy songs and amazing imagery that still impresses after nearly 70 years. A perennial favorite, it paved the way for other grand movies (Pinocchio, Bambi, Fantasia, Dumbo et all) The DVD has great 'making of' material, including never before seen archive footage.  A must-have for Disney and film fans alike.	5.0	An essential chapter in movie-making history	2005-06-23	1	0	1

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A30IP5D5DLHRPA	Kyle Slayzar	"At first I was really skeptical at the idea of a 1080p version of a film made more than a half-century ago.  Blu-Ray renditions of classic films such as Top Gun and Ghostbusters leave considerably more to be desired since most movie watchers could care less about the plethora of special features per disc.  This begs the question of ""why should we watch classics on Blu-Ray beyond two dozen different commentaries that couldn't be fit on a single DVD disc?  As such, I was curious to see how Sony would remaster the classic with Blue-Ray capabilities.After watching Snow White on Blu-Ray, my skepticism still remains albeit the film did, to a certain extent, exceed expectation.The film is, indeed, completely remastered in a fashion akin to how George Lucas re-rendered/restored numerous scenes in the original Star Wars trilogy (albeit w/o additional scenes).  The animation is considerably improved upon as the flow seems to be more fluid if not seamless.  It bears a certain resemblance to cell shading although that would be a reasonable stretch.Pertaining to the special features, I'll be bluntly honest here.  I could care less about the silly flash-esque games, the documentaries, storyboards, family game night features, sing-a-long, crap.  I'm sure some kids and film afficianados will appreciate said features, but to the majority of us movie watchers forking over the capitol to invest in a Blu-Ray player we typically have one thing on our mind; high definition viewing.  As such, I really cannot speculate on the alleged awesomeness that is the special features on the disc since I would rather throw in Uncharted 2 into my PS3 and play that instead.However, the digital re-rending/restoring of Snow White was impressive enough to justify obtaining the Blu-Ray copy over a regular DVD disc of the film.  Well done Disney!  Now bring out Beauty and the Beast and Lion King in Blu-Ray before I go buy Mass Effect 2 on my 360!  :P"	5.0	The Imortalization of a Classic	2010-01-28	1	0	1

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2OW01WJTEBPG3	"""lanman_themovie"""	Snow White and the Seven Dwarves is a classic movie, no doubt about it, but this will soon be known as a classic DVD in its own right.From one of the best re-mastering jobs ever known, the masters at Disney have made this 1937 movie look like it was just made.  Besides crystal clear and bright colors, it also features the addition of 5.1 digital audio, something obviously not even available when the film was first created.  After all the hard work in restoring it, the movie shines and allows the great story to have its full emotional impact.The features, in addition, are done with a phenomenal menu system that's easy enough for anyone to approach. The menus themselves are narrated by a newly computer animated magic mirror that just adds a magic touch. The features are smartly organized and even feature guided tours through them by some celebrity hosts.Overall, this is one of the best DVD's ever and a classic gem for any collection.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1GUX6R8DV3ZLY	Lauren A.	"This product includes a Blu-ray disk and a DVD.  We do not yet have a Blu-ray player, so I can just comment on the DVD.  I have 2 kids who were born after Snow White went into the ""vault"" last time.  Thus, the only copy we had was a VHS.  The sound on that VHS was awful.  The color and picture on the video are more intense and the sound is significantly crisper compared to the old VHS version.As for the movie, created in 1939, Snow White is amazing.  Every time I see it, I am blown away by Walt Disney's genius.  Snow White is different from other princesses in that her hair is styled in a short 1930s style and her singing voice is definitely more high pitched compared to the later princesses.  She also seems to be younger - no age is given for her, but it seems like she is 13 or so.The movie is rather violent - a young child could potentially be scared by the Queen's desire for the hunter to ""cut out Snow White's heart"" and the images of Snow White fleeing into the dark forest.  The Queen's convesion into a witch may be frightening too, as might the morbid concept of Snow White laying in a glass coffin, presumably dead.  Parents should be aware that the movie is rather morbid.  My daughter was frightened the first time she saw it a few years ago but she is mesmerized by the movie.  The scariness is balanced by the delightful dwarves and Snow White's sweet naivete.  The movie provides a great lesson on talking to strangers.Snow White is generally faithful to the original fairy tale, except Snow White is offered only the poison apple.  In the fairy tale, Snow White is offered a poison comb and one other poison object before the apple.  And, like the other Disney Princess movies to follow, Snow White can communicate with animals.Fantastic movie, a bit dated.  The DVD is a great improvement, at least over my prior VHS version."	5.0	Snow White DVD/Blue Ray combo is great!	2009-11-01	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	It is clear from the DVD edition that Disney has put together for &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; the beloved film enshrined in cinema history as the first full-length animated film, that this is the standard by which all future Disney releases will be judged.  Your kids or grandchildren might find the animation to be somewhat quaint, but they will certainly be impressed by this &quot;Immersive 2-Disc DVD Experience.&quot;  There is so much to do with the extras that they might even forget to actually watch the movie, which has been digitally restored.  However, this would be a big mistake as you are not going to be able to solve the puzzles and win &quot;Dopey's Wild Mine Ride&quot; game if you have not seen the film.Everything is hosted by either Roy Disney or the Magic Mirror on the Wall (you have to love that that dry sense of humor), and what they have on the first disc along with the movie is enough to thrill any fan of Snow White.  You can listen to Barbra Streisand sing &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot; or you can all sing the Karaoke version of &quot;Heigh-Ho.&quot;  Then there is &quot;The Making of 'Snow White'&quot; documentary, the aduio commentary and even the Silly Symphony cartoon &quot;Goddess of Spring.&quot;  And all of this is before you even get to the second disc where you are simply going to find what must be EVERYTHING Disney has relating to this film as we explore &quot;The Legacy of 'Snow White.'&quot;  There are not just deleted scenes and a deleted song (&quot;You're Never Too Old To Be Young&quot;), there are abandoned concepts for several scenes, such as a &quot;fantasy version&quot; of &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come.&quot;  Just look at the Edition Details for this DVD: have you ever seen a list that long?  It took me the entire weekend just to get through MOST of what is on this DVD.Yes, you bought the Disney animated films on videotape and then you went out and got them on DVD.  But the extras alone are worth the price of this first &quot;Platinum Edition.&quot;  Most importantly, Disney has clearly made a covenant with its audience that this is indeed the level of excellence they will do with their entire collection of classic films and I only hope they do this not just for &quot;Pinocchio&quot; but also for &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; as well.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A19RAJY6R7USN0	"Lee Neville ""emotionboy"""	There really is nothing like the first time. And the first time we ever saw a full length animated feature on the big screen was Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the classic story of a princess who goes to live with seven men (she's not easy by the way) who have serious problems with growth.The animation is brilliant, as are the songs which are equally fairy tale like. Having seen this film many many times I have found it to be lots of fun, but also now a little dated. I know I could be committing blasphemy by saying this about the amazing achievement of Snow White, but after seeing it so many times it seems tired...- That was until this 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD came out. The animation and sound is perfectly remastered, giving it a whole new lease of life. The DVD has the ultimate selection of special features for Snow White fans- too many for me to be bothered to list right now, but trust me you won't be disappointed. This is the best effort to date from Disney DVD and is extraordinarily highly recommended.	5.0	A New Lease Of Life	2005-08-10	1	1	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AC7J8ZLWJIKNS	Lincoln J. Mennuti	"Disney has really shown foresight in offering a Blu-ray/DVD package here. Even with the prices dropping for Blu-ray everyday, there's still some of us folks that aren't convinced (yet) that converting to Blu-ray from DVD is worth the cost.This package offers the DVD for us ""old-timers"" to enjoy, and also an incentive to go Blu-ray to enjoy the full glory that 6x more capacity can give.Either way, this classic looks and sounds great. If you look up the history (Wikipedia) of Walt Disney's Snow White, this 1937 film was the first in a lot of categories; It was the first full-length cel-animated feature in motion picture history, as well as the first animated feature film produced in America, the first produced in full color, the first to be produced by Walt Disney, and the first to be considered a Walt Disney Animated Classic.Usually, anything that's a first has to go through several updates/changes before it gets better, but Snow White is that rarity that hit all the right marks the first time around. Then, in June of 2008, The American Film Institute declared it the greatest animated film of all time.The hand-animated life-like smoothness, the classic Disney Epic storytelling and the depth of the characters...At the current price of 20bucks, it's a no-brainer to have this timeless masterpiece and in a format that will likely last decades if not a lifetime."	5.0	Timeless classic, brought to current innovation	2009-10-14	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2RHV42BTJSVON	"Liolania ""In2Jesus"""	"Although ""Snow white"" has never been a personal favorite of mine, I cannot deny its charm or its influence on animated films in general.  The last time I watched ""Snow White"" it was when I was about 15yrs on my mom's old VHS copy, that was 9yrs ago, and I fell asleep half-way through it. However, considering ""Snow White's"" universal praise, I figured there must be something wrong with me, so I decided to watching it once again and see if it held my interest or not.For me, this movie still remains an oddity, for me it is dated in its feel a lot more than any other major Disney Film, and yet it still holds great treasures and beauty in it.  The animation at first look seems to be extremely dates and grainy, but when taking a closer look, I realized the grainy aged look of the backgrounds were intentional.  Much like the artwork in ""Sleeping Beauty"" is fashioned after renaissance paintings, so ""Snow White"" is fashioned after paintings, in this case water color paintings.  The back drops have the distinct grainy look of water colors on water colors paper.  When I realized this, I began to appreciate this movie a great deal more because I now could see how much work really went in to the animation.  The rest of the animation for the most part looks like standard 1930's animation in its style, and especially in the movement of the animals resembles many cartoons of the times, but it rises far above those cartoons to become a cultural icon.As for the story, it is very simple and follows for the most part, the traditional folk tale of Snow White (with some obvious changes).  Instead of trying to expand too much on the story and create a heavy drama, rather a sweet story of first love reminiscent of many other movies of the era is penned.  The pacing is quite slow even though the movie itself is only 78minutes and I am sure this is what made me fall asleep before and why it still at times fails to hold my attention; it is due to the slower pacing on of the 1930's and is not s fault of the writers I feel, if anything its a testament to the short attention spans of today.  The characters are little more than stock characters, but they are created in such a fun way that it almost feels like they originated from this movie.The music and singing in the movie is very much a product of its time, but this adds to the charm of the film.  Every time I hear Snow White sing I am reminded of many other 1930's films and shows I've watched, and how the art of true singing has died away and given way to the popular belting/yelling technique.  The singing here is georgeous and the music is catchy and delightful!  Making things that could be mundane such as cleaning, washing faces, and working in to fun and memorable musical sequences!The story, animation, and music work together to create a movie that will no doubt be loved until the end of the world, and this transfer does it great justice.  I did not have the opportunity to purchase the previous Platinum edition on DVD, and had only seen it ever on VHS, so this transfer on Blu-ray really allowed me to see its true quality as an animated movie.  The more I watch it the better and richer it gets, its astonishing and the clarity of the transfer and touch-ups is perfect!I am not really one for extras on DVD and Blu-Ray, I generally just watch the movie, but there are some fun extras on here such as a fun gem game, deleted scenes that include the cut ""Soup"" scene, what was the possible sequel to ""Snow White"" and a lot more I haven't even gotten to yet.If you're wondering if this is worth the money, I give it a resounding YES!

The  special features and restoration really made this come to life. I watched it with a three year old who tried catching the animals on the screen. It was a trip down memory lane; except this trip was way better.The witch was so scary that the little one grabbed me and said she was scared. A little reassurrance, and some very cheery dwarfs later, and she was singing and smiling!For me, this was just such a great experience, including the Walt DIsney discussion and games.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3C6007PJOPGRA	livsmom04 Charlotte	I have to say that I was very lucky to receive an advance copy of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition Combo Pack in the mail the other day. I couldn't believe how quickly I received it and before it even comes out to the public. Well I received the pack and the Diamond Edition Combo Pack is the Blu-Ray Disc and a DVD. We love this movie not only because it's a classic movie but because it just happens to be Olivia's favorite Princess. Not only will you get just the classic tale of Snow White but you'll also get plenty of extras too like:* First time ever in High Def. 7.1 Sound* All New Music Video* Disneyview~Expanded viewing experience* Disney Family Plan~games for everyone in the family!* Backstage Disney~going behind the scenes to this awesome tale* Classic Bonus features which includes Karaoke Sing A Longs, and much more!This soon to be Newly Released Disney Classic looks amazing!!! I remember the original one that we had on VHS and that one looks very fuzzy and dull compared to this new copy! The colors are magnificent and we love the movie even more! The sound on this copy also is awesome and so much clearer as well. And did you know that if you upgrade to a Blu-Ray Player not only will you be able to play the more kid-proof discs but you'll also be able to play your favorite DVD's as well. That's so cool in my opinion and it's something that I just learned! I was going to purchase this movie around Christmas time for Olivia but now that we have the advance copy I don't have to and it's something that we can both enjoy now instead of later!!! You can purchase this Combo Pack that includes the Blu-Ray Disc and DVD on October 6th from any major retailer for only $39.99. What a great deal in my opinion!!! What more could a little girl want than her very own copy of the classic tale that started everything: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

I got Sleeping Beauty and the outer cover for Snow White but not the movie.  Of course I had paid for it.  So upon notifying the seller I did get an immediate response and they said they would get one out to me the next day and would have it two days later.  Which meant I was going to have to Fed Ex the Christmas box at a great expense.  Well I never got the movie in time for Christmas!!!! It arrived several days AFTER Christmas which means it didn't get to my granddaughter in time.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2HUSA9E26OJRB	L. Markowitz	"I have a Panasonic DMP-BD80 Blu-ray Disc Player with the latest firmware installed. These are actual load times because I used a stop watch after the first attempt. The load time for the previews was just over 1.5 minutes (acceptable), but that's not the bad part. After the previews you get a screen that basically say it will take about 2 to 3 minutes to load. The screen was displayed for just over 11 minutes and then went blank, but I could hear the disk spinning so I waited till just over 15 minutes to stop it, after the disk slowed down. I hit the [Stop] button and got a message that said ""This disc does not allow this operation"". So I turned the machine off and ejected the disk. I then tried again. The same results, but this time after 15 minutes I just let it go, and wouldn't you know it after 21 minutes and 17 seconds the move menu came up. I have the Disney UP movie also, though not as bad it took close to around 9 minutes to load. Let's compare this to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix [Blu-ray] 4 second to start playing, 4 second to top menu (yes that is 4 seconds). For fairness Harry Potter's menus isn't as advanced as the next movie I comparing it too.  Next comparison Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen [Blu-ray] 1 minute and 13 second to load its menu. I have other but the results are similar. What the heck is wrong with Disney? I will not buy another Disney movie if this is how bad there load times will be. And how do they calculate the 2-3 minute estimated load time. I just wish I had a PS3 to test it on. I guess Disney's magic doesn't work on Blu-ray.I got this movie free with the Blu-Ray player purchase. But I think I deserve another movie to select form from Amazon.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3BXKLDAHKI74U	L. Merrill	"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a must-have movie for every collection.  The Diamond Edition includes both a regular DVD as well as the blu-ray edition of the film.  This is something I greatly appreciate with four young children--the regular DVD can be used by them to watch over and over while the Blu-ray film remains pristine in our collection.Snow White is one of my favorites of all Disney's films.  It is not only a classic movie, but one that has ingrained itself in American culture.  This particular release includes bonus features such as Disney's Family Play and Backstage Disney.  Children will enjoy the mini games while film or history buffs will love the behind-the-scenes information.In classic fairy-tale tradition, Snow White must escape her evil step-mother--and--queen.  She runs away and encounters the seven dwarfs.  For a while, all is well--Snow White endears herself to the dwarfs and takes care of them in return for a place to stay.  The Queen discovers her hiding place and entices her to bite an apple that has been infused with an evil spell.  Snow White succumbs to the apple's poison.  All is not lost, however--the spell may be broken by true love's kiss!  When Snow White's soul mate arrives and kisses her, she awakens to live ""happily ever after.""  While some may object to the helpless female character passively waiting to be rescued by her prince, the movie is still an enjoyable story and this could provide an excellent opportunity to discuss such issues in a wider context.This is one movie that needs to be in everyone's movie collection.  The entire family will enjoy watching this--it is a timeless classic that has been visually enhanced for modern viewing."	5.0	A Must for Every Collection!	2009-11-06	0	0	0

A child born later than 2002 will not see Snow White on DVD in a store for atleast a decade. So much for experiencing Snow White in the magical years.

It is all-new digital restored with enhanced picture and sound, so with the Blu-Ray, the picture is amazing.The add-ons are terrific.  Snow White Returns - Newly discovered storyborads.

That wouldn't have bothered me, but, it was twice as big as it needed to be, therefore, since there was also NO padding inside, the 3 dvds flopped around inside the box breaking the little cogs that hold the dvds in place in the Sleeping Beauty case. Since there were two dvds in the Sleeping Beauty box, they mixed with the broken pieces and became scratched. When I ordred them, I was thrilled the Sleeping Beauty and the Snow White movies were new...that's why I paid a bit more for them, but now the Sleeping Beauty dvds are scratched with damaged cogs. To top it off, the box they were shipped in smells EXTREMELY musty making the DVD boxes also stink. I will not be purchasing anymore dvds from THIS seller in the future. Very disappointed. Am also unhappy about paying $11.97 for shipping for 3 dvds coming from the same place in a stinky, unpadded, thin box.	3.0	Like that it is new & shrink wrapped...don't like the shipping cartoon or the smell	2013-07-01	1	1	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	"The Disney Company has over used the term Masterpiece when referring to its own movies. But this one truly deserves that title. While its animation betray its age, the story and characters are still fun, and its place in history also makes it a must.The story is simple and familiar. Snow White's wicket stepmother wants her killed because Snow White is ""the fairest of them all."" She is saved from this fate, and hides out with seven dwarfs. But will the queen find her and try to kill her?Walt's genius here was in creating the characters. The dwarfs have very distinctive personalities, and some of the best scenes in the movie revolve around them. (The scene where they first come home is a classic.) The animals add some humor as well, especially when cleaning the cottage.The plot moves along well, and when I first saw it in college, I was drawn into the story even though I knew the ending. I actually felt tears when the dwarfs were mourning Snow White.By today's standards, the animation is flawed, especially for the prince. However, there are some truly beautiful scenes as well, particularly the sun set when the dwarfs are coming home. Fans of Disney in the 30's will recognize the feel of some of the silly symphony cartoons. The important thing to remember when watching this movie is its place in history. This is the first animated movie ever, produced when everyone thought no one would ever see it. The fact that we're still watching it is a testimony to Walt as a filmmaker and pioneer.This DVD set is the perfect way to enjoy this movie.  The picture and soundtrack have been lovingly restored, and look and sound incredible.  The sound is presented in Dolby 5.1 and its original mono.  I didn't notice that much difference between the two modes, but it's nice to have the option.  The first disc also contains a wonderful audio commentary.  Recorded interviews with Walt Disney are interspersed with comments from John Canemaker.  I learned quite a bit about the film from this commentary.  The second disc contains all you would ever want to know about the history of the film.  They've got character design changes, completely abandoned concepts, deleted scenes, and information on the releases over the years to name a few things.  I spent hours soaking up the information and enjoying every moment of it.This is truly a classic movie that belongs in any film fan's library.  Hurry and get this wonderful set before it disappears."	5.0	A Masterpiece gets the Treatment it Deserves	2003-02-05	56	46	10

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A16SS8HYJW7IEJ	"Mark Pollock ""educator"""	Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent dvd set, but...There are moments that make me wonder, is this all really necessary?For instance, the film looks good. Very good. Too good. There is not a flaw to be seen, no specks, no dirt, no dust. Nothing. It's simply too clean. I get this horrible feeling sometimes that I'm not watching the original film, but a remake!Yet the restoration is well done, and the colors are simply phenominal. This is how the film must have looked the first time it was shown.There are many bonus materials here, almost all of which are excellent. The lost scenes are fascinating, the additional music and film materials are interesting, and the development ideas are well presented.Then comes the scariest moment of all - a history of the Disney company.It starts off well enough, and we get to see all the artistic acheivements that happened in the 30's, 40's, 50's, and 60's, but when we get to the 80's, it gets scary. We basically have a laundry list of everything the Disney comapny owns, parks, baseball teams, hockey teams, boats, and on and on. I was waiting for Angela Lansbury to pull out the deed to the country. What was sad was how blunt the presentation was of what is basically corporate propaganda. It ruined the spirit of the whole set for me, as I realized that these dvds weren't made to celebrate art, they were made to celebrate the beginning of a corporate monolith.Ah well, the rest of this set is great, and by buying it, I've increased stock values.Enjoy!	4.0	Perhaps a bit over the top...	2002-03-14	4	2	2
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AX910DV74BN8Z	Mark R. Vincent	We chose this rating because after growing up with the better innocent tales which Disney created, we were so pleased to share this with our 4 year old daughter.  Think that some of Disney's newer material/films have lost their innocence of appealing to the minds and hearts of children, and yet this film stands alone with some of the better original films produced by Disney.  These appeal much more to the imagination and fantasies of childhood years and feel it's so important to let our youth have just that - their youth!Since the Disney vault only releases some of the older movies from time to time, we felt fortunate to be able to obtain a copy from Micah at Eastcoasthollywood to share with our family.  She made sure that we were satisfied with the movie and that it was delivered ontime.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A33HMSDUN0WR7J	Matthew A Hervey	"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves was the first animated feature film ever.  It was made in a time when animater's didn't have any reference point to follow, and before Walt Disney Studios became a money printing factory.  If your sick of Disney commercialism please remember this film came out in the thirties when animation was still quite good, and may I say they did a beutiful job.But you allready know about the movie.  You want to hear about the DVD extras.  I've been watching this thing for three days and I still haven't seen everything.  And listen to this.  The audio commentery is by Walt Disney.  You read that correctly.  Pieces of interveiws and comments he made about the film between it's release and his death have been placed in the apropriate spots and edited together to make a commentery track from beyond the grave, one I never would have thought possible.  There is a documentary, hosted by Angela ""Lovet's Meat Pies"" Landsbury (who also star's in a special feature that teaches us how to use the special features), about the making and history (and prehistory) of the film.  The DVD also contain's a classic Disney ""Silly Symphony"" short, The Goddess Of Spring, and tons of pencil tests, story boards, concept art, deleted songs and ....Oh yeah, it also has Striesand, If you can tolerate it."	5.0	Extra Extra (read all about it)	2002-01-13	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A17TPT3FWAE5T1	"Matthew Spady ""800rsd"""	"Does anyone need to be convinced that Walt Disney's Snow White is a masterpiece animation that has a place in every home library?  I doubt it.  The real question is which version to purchase.This DVD version is certainly a top contender.  Whereas many ""special"" editions contain the feature, the trailers, and an interview or two, this one - actually there are two DVD's - is packed full of  production information, historical information, children's activities, features that help explain how an animated film is created, and a short clip featuring Adriana Caselotti, the lady who gave the speaking and singing voice to Snow White. The commentary on the special features is informative (often educational), but short enough to fit young attention spans.Among my favorite features are Barbra Streisand singing ""Some day my Prince will come"" as a series of frames from the movie pass across the screen; the abandoned concepts section that includes sketches of scenes that were considered, but never developed for the movie; audio containing the rehearsal and taping of a song that was cut from the film; and an English translation of the Grimm's Fairy Tale that a parent can read aloud to a child or an adult can use to compare with the final Disney version.My absolute favorite feature is the ""Princess Fashion Boutique"" a computerized paper-doll with a closet full of possible outfits.  OK, I admit it, I'm not a little girl, but I can imagine if I were, this would really be fun.At first, navigation may seem a little confusing, but after a few wrong turns, it becomes easy."	5.0	A fantastic edition of a classic animated feature	2001-11-28	4	4	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2F8R40Z2OMIJM	"Matt Howe ""outloud98"""	I was extremely excited to receive this DVD....  Upon opening it, one gets the feeling that it is truly a special edition.  The packaging is very nice: the DVD box is sturdy with two openings for each disk.  The pamphlet inside the DVD is gorgeously produced and very helpful.My first impression is that Disney has spent much time making this DVD user-friendly.  There is an abundance of directions and drawings showing you what is on the disk and how to get there.  Since there are two disks and a KINGDOM of information to pour through, these directions are very welcome (even to this seasoned DVD-viewer!)Disney pulls out some familiar faces to make the experience as warm as possible:  Disney himself appears in various footage; Angela Lansbury narrates the documentary and provides a &quot;tour&quot; of the disks; Michael Eisner shows up; and Barbra Streisand sings a specially recorded version of &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot;.SNOW WHITE, the movie, looks gorgeous and, although old fashioned, is quite wonderful.  SNOW WHITE, the double-disk, is a lot of information to wade through.  I am amazed at the amount of behind-the-scenes film that exists!  Disney must have suspected that he was creating a classic - he filmed every aspect of it!  I especially enjoy the HALL OF ART section.  There are 3 halls of various story art (i.e. &quot;The cottage&quot;; &quot;The castle&quot;; &quot;the Forest&quot;; etc.)  Although initially I found it hard to move from hall to hall, I eventually figured it out.  The animated HALLS are extraordinary and the art that &quot;hangs&quot; there is incredible -- various renderings and attempts at bringing the story and locales of SNOW WHITE alive.  It's even more incredible that Disney Co. held on to these papers for all these years.Well, in case you can't tell, I highly recommend the special SNOW WHITE disks.  You will spend days looking at everything that is included -- or you can opt to spend an hour and a half viewing the original,gorgeous film that started the Disney empire....	5.0	Disney Magic Makes SNOW WHITE Classic DVD	2001-10-02	245	217	28

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A370Z6I5GBWU44	"M ""Delicious Strawberry"""	Mind you, this is by no means the first animated project Disney did - there were all the black-and-white shorts as well as some color shorts, but Snow White was the first full-length animated movie that Disney produced.Like other fairy tales, Disney took liberties with Snow White. We see NOTHING of her father, so we assume that he is already dead. It's unclear what Snow White is Princess of, so the background could use more work. Still, the evil Queen was nicely done, and this movie features stuff that would become typical Disney fare - animal buddies, musical numbers, a happy ending, what have you. I do wish that the movie had been more faithful to the tale in the part where the Queen disguises herself. In the movie, she only presents a poisoned apple, but in the story, she first offered a comb (poisoned, of course) and a girdle/corset/belt (depends on what version of the story you're reading) that made Snow White unable to breathe. I'd have liked to see the comb and belt in the movie.The dwarves are very likeable, and it's great to see the relationship between Snow White and them develop.I'm not really crazy about Snow White's costume design, the dress could have been done better, but her face is just darling.	4.0	The movie that started it all...	2011-02-01	0	0	0

The pictures are a bit grainy at times but that is to be expected for such and old original.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A10CJINP7KBR4W	M. Herzog	I'm going to saw something about Snow White you don't hear very often, it's very raw.  I don't mean its dark or raunchy, or any of the more often used understanding of raw.  I mean, it was something that was done before Disney perfected its formula for movies and animation.  The animals act as if they are sentient thinkers and such, but they do not yet talk.  The story is very basic, and in some cases don't make sense (so the queen decides to make herself the fairest of all by making herself an ugly old witch?), and thanks to the blu ray, you can see all the edges and marks of the original artwork.  The thing about something that was at one point so new and innovative as Snow White is to look at it like that.  Now, Snow White is cannon, arguably the most recognized and famous of Disney movies, but at one time it was the work of a group of film makers who were trying to do something raw and unique, and were at the threshold of inventing a new genre.I can't fathom at how unique Snow White was when it first came out, but I can marvel at watching its majestic beauty on Blu Ray.  The print is gorgeous, as Disney Movies tend to be.  I see the clarity of the animations and music as well as the edges and markings that show the time of the animation.  It's a great presentation.  If I had a complaint, it would be the lack of all of the features of the Platinum Edition DVD.  There were a few features on the Platinum edition that are not on the Diamond Edition, most notably a pretty lengthy documentary narrated by angela langsbury.  While this isn't a killer, its worth noting.  But you don't buy Snow White for its special features, you buy it for the movie and its presentation, and this is an amazing presentation.  Recommended to anyone who has ever loved an animated film.	5.0	An Absolutely Revolutionary Movie	2009-10-14	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A35Q0RBM3YNQNF	M. Hill	"Side-by-side, I watched the Blu-ray disc of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs along with the regular DVD included in the Diamond Edition released in October 2009.  Was the contrast between the Blu-ray and the original movie obvious? Yes. But, is the enhancement an improvement?I am all for progress but as I watched the two versions together, although my eyes were drawn to the Blu-ray version for the vivid colors and clarity, there were definite problems with the changes. The colors are so bright that the misty original now looks like a current cartoon/animated feature instead of an old classic -- cheapened by the process rather than enriched. The original is filmed with a diffused gauzy sensibility in muted colors in both the background and foreground - a perfect balance and an expected setting for a fairy tale with a lovely princess, dwarfs, a wicked queen and a handsome prince.In places on the disc, the Blu-ray contains inconsistent color enhancement.  One scene - Snow White and the woodland creatures cleaning the dwarfs' home is a good example of the uneven application of the color saturation. The characters are harshly colorized in comparison to the subtle background - to the degree that it reminded me of a colorized classic black and white film where the backgrounds often remain in black and white and only the foregrounds are tinted. The dwarfs' mine scene is another example of the problem. So, parts of the movie are noticeably out-of-balance. The original looks like a work of art and the new version looks, although vividly colored, of lesser over-all quality and depth.It is great to have both versions, and the extras are terrific, but sometimes ""improvements"" this drastic have the opposite affect and end-up detracting."	3.0	Do the enhancements actually enhance the original?	2009-10-21	260	228	32
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A31BD4RXCON7QO	Michael A. Duvernois	Seeing the plans for the sequel, from the old animation studio storyboards, was rather fun. But the biggest thing going on here is the high definition recording of Snow White. It looks good. Really good. With animation, upgrading to high def seems to be pretty smooth. You fill in the data and there's not a lot of artistry needed. The colors are saturated, movement is smooth, and the audio is clear and noise-free. Until the next technology, this is the definitive Snow White.	5.0	Beautiful look to the Blue-ray, DVD for the car trip, and decent extras	2009-10-19	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A38ZTUNQJVGP6S	Michael Patrick Boyd	"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is one hour and twenty-three minutes and premiere in theaters on December 21, 1937. This would be the first full length animated film and the one that started it all for Walt Disney. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs tell the story of Snow White who is the beautiful step-daughter to the evil and vain Queen; full name is never given in the movie. The Queen dresses Snow White in rags and makes her work as a scullery maid. Everyday the Queen asked the Magic Mirror who was the fairest of them all and as long as the Magic Mirror told the Queen she was one sexy babe then Snow White got to live another. One day the Magic Mirror told the Queen she was no longer the fairest and the land and that Snow White was the new beauty babe in town. This upset the Queen to no end so she devised a plot to kill Snow White. The Queen tells the Huntsman to take Snow White to the hillside to pick some flowers and to kill her and to bring Snow White's heart back as proof of the jobs. The Huntsman could not bring himself to do the job and to tell Snow White to flee and never come back. Snow White finds shelter in the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs. The Seven Dwarfs discover Snow White in their cottage and decides that she can live with them, mainly because she can make gooseberry pie. Grumpy is the only who want her to scram because in his opinion women are nothing but trouble. To some husbands and boyfriends that statement may be true.Well the Queen finds out from the Magic Mirror that the Huntsman did not do his job and as the old saying goes: ""if you want something done right then do it yourself"". The Queen turns herself into an old Peddler and creates a poison apple that will make Snow White take one long nap. The Queen, now an old hag, finds Snow White and tricks her into taking a bite out of the apple and Snow White is now in snooze land. The animals of the forest rush to warn the Seven Dwarfs and it is Grumpy that leads the charge to save Snow White. The Dwarfs chase and traps the Queen to a mountain cliff. The Queen tries to loosen a boulder to kill the Dwarfs, but a bolt of lightning strikes the cliff and she fall to her death; and you the folks out there already knows the ending to the story.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	ABMWAM9O42S2J	Michael W. Jacobson	"Disney has been most generous of late in guiding their customers toward the future by releaseing titles such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as reasonably priced combo packs that include both the DVD and Blu-ray discs.  Since there are many who long to make the switch to high definition but haven't quite committed, these sets allow them to enjoy the experience on standard DVD for the time being, and then when they finally do go Blu-ray, they won't have to re-purchase the disc...they'll already be set, and finally see what they've been missing.It's the Blu-ray I want to pay more attention to, because if you think this movie has looked glorious on past digital issues (and it certainly has), you are in for a revelation that will leave you smiling and speechless.  If you didn't know, you'd never EVER believe this was a seven-decades plus old movie.  It is absolutely pristine and spotless in a new 1080p transfer.  The colors are more vibrant and beautiful than ever before, and all the incredible detail of Walt Disney's imaginative direction renders through with a clarity I would dare say not seen since 1937 movie screens.After a quick comparison, I cannot tell you that the effort Disney put into the DVD presentation is worth any less than four stars in its own right, but such a comparison is inherently unfair.  Or, at least it WOULD be, except that Disney gives us both in one package.  The DVD is clean, clear, and colorful, and will certainly make fans without Blu-ray exceedingly happy...but again, Disney uses Blu-ray technology to the absolute apex of its capabilities here.  There's nothing like seeing a true cinematic classic looking more stunning than ever before, and Disney and Blu-ray teamed together offer fans nothing less than that kind of experience.Also, with this combo pack, you can opt for the experience your home theatre allows.  With both discs, you can experience the film with a restored original mono soundtrack...intriguing for purists, but for me, you have to go with one of the digital surround remixes.  On the DVD, you get the terrific Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, and on the Blu-ray, a brand new uncompressed DTS 7.1 offering.Disney's use of technology for these new mixes is respectful; they don't try and create an experience that Walt never intended, but by opening up the dynamic range, giving the bigger scenes a little more space on the front and middle stages, and using the subwoofer to add a little more menace to the scarier scenes, the original experience is not lost, but simply enhanced.  And the musical orchestrations sound more vivid and lush than ever before...a wonderful audio presentation!Going from Platinum to Diamond in status makes me wonder if there are enough precious and rare materials in the world for future Disney editions...but no matter.  This Diamond Edition Blu-ray/DVD combo pack offers hours and hours of fun, informative and interactive features.  I'm sure to miss a few, so forgive me, but I will try to be as complete and organized as I can.With either disc one (DVD) or disc two (Blu-ray), you can enjoy a commentary with animation historian John Canemaker, featuring archival clips of the late great Walt Disney offering his thoughts on his breakthrough achievement.  There is also a new music video for ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" from Disney Channel star Tiffany Thornton, plus a sneak peak at the studio's next big offering The Princess and the Frog.The second Blu-ray disc offers some Family Play games through BD LIVE...you can play alone, or you can challenge others to beat your scores.  ""Jewel Jumble"" is a neat twist on stacking games like Tetris, while ""Mirror Mirror"" will show you which princess you're most like...I opted not to play that one.  ""What Do You See?"" challenges you as to how fast you can recognize a blurry image coming into focus.A very cool and very new extra is the archival look at a film that was never made: ""Snow White Returns"".  Using recently discovered artwork and notes, we can get a feel of what a planned but ultimately scrapped sequel might have been like.  Some classic extras are here as well...two animated scenes that were never completed and cut from the film, including the famous soup bowl song and the dwarfs building a bed together.  Enhanced View mode fills the black bars at the left and right (this film is in its original 1.33:1 mode) with some lovely and comparable artwork from Toby Bluth.The third disc, also for Blu-ray, contains more bonus features from the previous Platinum Edition DVD, including one of my favorite interactive games, ""Dopey's Wild Mine Ride"".  Can you race through the mines and gather your friends in time to save Snow White?  There is also a look back at Walt Disney's original Hyperion Studios, the retrospective Snow White featurette ""The One That Started it All"", a look at the voice talents, the ""Disney Through the Decades"" featurette, and the ""Heigh-Ho"" karaoke sing-along.A genuine classic has gotten the kind of treatment high definition fans would hope for, but thanks to this Diamond Edition combo pack, all fans of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs can enjoy a beautiful and feature-packed presentation.  Then, for those who don't have Blu-ray and eventually get one, they will have the chance to see what they've been missing, and wonder why they waited so long!"	5.0	A classic looking more beautiful than ever!	2009-10-02	21	19	2

I did search around and found an English audio version on the DVD, but I had to go through the &#34;Korean&#34; DVD commands to do so.  And even then it was trial and error finding the English audio version.  I've always had good luck with the items I bought through Amazon.  But this is one I had to return.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3H9X9EQCKXQTX	MonsterJam	"Well, it took me three times to make my way through Disney's Blu-Ray version of Snow White; let's just say there was more than one person named ""Sleepy"". It's not the most gripping of movies. But it is a masterpiece and a break-though film for the Walt Disney company.As with most movie reviews I do, I will speak to the quality of the transfer, and not the film itself. Plenty of others will have covered that ground, and besides, I think its box office track record speaks for itself.Video: B: The majority of the film is clean and pristine. However, some scenes appear blurred or out of focus. Also, I was surprised when I noticed that Snow White's face and arm in a frame had blue pixilation's, as if the computer processing had not really been complete. I had not seen this same effect in Pinocchio or Sleeping Beauty. Do I have a defective disc?Audio: C: Frankly, the audio was extremely flat. Mixed in 7.1? You could get away with using only a center channel 95 percent of the time. And the sub was lightly used. Let down.Assuming my disc is not defective (and I don't think it is), it is apparent to me that this Disney classic was on cruise control with the computer restoration, and very little effort has gone into ensuring the computer restoration was utterly complete. I'll be guarded in my hoped for future releases (like Dumbo). Still, I have these films only on VHS (I skipped DVD), so Blu-Ray is an obvious step up in quality.Extras: A+: Usually I am not concerned in extras. I'll watch it, but its not part of the grading criteria. In this case, however, I am inclined to comment and include it in the overall grade. The second disc, one that is primarily dominated by the History of Hyperion Studios, is AMAZING. More work went into producing this masterpiece than with the actual accompanying movie feature. For any serious Disney fan, this is a MUST OWN.

It's the classic Grimm Brothers fairytale of a beautiful young princess who escapes a murder plot by her jealous stepmother, the queen, and is taken in by seven kindly dwarfs who live in a forest cottage and spend their days mining for precious jewels. One fateful day, after the wicked queen has discovered through her magic mirror that Snow White is still alive, she uses her talent for witchcraft to create a cursed, poison apple, disguises herself as an old hag, and journeys out to finish Snow White once and for all. The only flaw in her plan is that true love's kiss can break the apple's spell.Simply put, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is a masterpiece. This is in no way an exaggeration. It may take a look at this Blu-Ray release's vast bonus features for much of the modern audience to truly appreciate how and why this film is such a masterpiece, but it is nonetheless. Even though this was Disney's first animated feature and the style reflects it, the amount of love, sweat, and tears poured into its making give it a unique and  enchanting richness only Pinocchio and Bambi even come close to. Snow White transports you to another world as only a few films can do. It is an old European storybook come to life. All the character designs and hand painted settings are glorious and an amazing advancement for the time. The Queen is one of the greatest screen villains ever, ruthless in a frighteningly believable way. All the songs are unforgettable classics, and while some have mocked Snow White's high-pitched voice over the years, Adriana Caselotti was the perfect choice for the sweet and innocent lead role and always sounds much better when viewing the film than we remember between distant viewings. And to guys like me who LOVE animated girls, while it is hard to compete with the modern Disney girls like Ariel, Belle, and Kim Possible, Snow White is truly a classic beauty and still very gorgeous. I always remember her as my first cartoon crush, alongside my first non-cartoon crush, Dorothy in MGM's Wizard of Oz. Funnily enough, it was the success of this film that allowed Oz to get the green light. Snow White not only has influenced films and filmmakers to this day, it also paved the way for a variety of types of films we have all loved so much, especially by earning respect for the fantasy genre.This new Diamond Edition Blu-Ray/DVD release of Snow White comes to us just in time for the Halloween season, and it's one of those Disney features that is just perfect for it! Old witches and poison apples just scream Halloween! We get 3 discs in the set: A Blu-Ray which holds the feature and a few bonus features, second Blu-Ray disc that holds the bulk of the bonus features, and a third disc that is a standard DVD of the feature film. It's a wonderful package that Disney is doing with all their Blu releases now, it seems, and I wish other studios would follow suit. Those of us who love buying Blu greatly appreciate getting standard DVD copies too for our other TVs in the house that maybe aren't upgraded yet, or for travel or computer use. For some reason, most of us DVD collectors just continue to be resistant when it comes to those pesky (and wasteful) digital download discs; nothing there to collect, really. I'm glad we aren't plagued with one of those things here.The feature film just looks and sounds incredible here, like never before! Truly gorgeous on Blu-Ray. Even if you own the previous DVD release, it's worth upgrading just for that. The Bonus Features are wonderful too, and there are tons. The previous (Platinum Edition) release of Snow White did hold much of what we have here, but there's lots of new stuff too, especially the Hyperion Studios Tour feature that showcases most of the Bonuses on Disc 2. There's a wonderful audio commentary by film historian John Canemaker and Walt Disney himself via archival audio clips on Disc 1 and several art galleries on Disc 2(I love the character design ones and the live-action reference stuff; also love promotional galleries). Disc 1 also holds a new music video for ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" as sung by the Disney Channel's Tiffany Thornton (not one of my favorite, current Disney Channel stars, but she does a good job with the song), a delightful look at the opening sequence of the upcoming ""The Princess and the Frog"", and an amazing look at two deleted scenes that were once planned to be used for a Snow White sequel short cartoon! I really found that last thing intriguing, and it's too bad they don't go ahead with that project today making use of the existing animation! After all, it's been long enough I think that it wouldn't hurt the integrity of the original (I mean, it's not like writing some new sequel that is totally focused on modern sensibilities and pandering to a toddler audience). It'd be wonderful to go to a new Disney feature and see that lost Snow White short playing before it. Also on Disc One are some games that are surprisingly fun, and a special feature that allows you to insert yourself into clips from the film using BD Live. There's also a how-to for using Disneyphile copies (the digital copies, ugh), even though Snow White didn't come with one. Oh, and before I forget, Disc One is also equipped with the ""Disney View"" option, so if you have a widescreen TV, which Blu-Rays are basically made for, you can activate to have the black bars on the side of this properly fullscreen film replaced with artwork meant to blend in with the film's backgrounds. Frankly, I tried this and found it distracting. Beautiful artwork, but in some scenes it didn't look right to me, like the forest stuff.As for more of what Disc Two holds in the Hyperion Tour section and beyond, as I said, there are galleries, but there are also tons of audio clips and featurettes that really do an amazing job of taking you back to the days Snow White was being made. You really get a feeling you're exploring the old Hyperion Studios with Walt and the animation legends; or more often, sitting in a room with them and listening to them reminisce. The stories are fascinating. An important thing to note here is that the story of the making of Disney's Snow White is very much the story of the early development of Disney animation and animation as a film medium in general, and the Bonus Features on Disc 2 do an amazing job reflecting and focusing on that. This is all about the beginnings of Disney animation. It's in depth, touching (if you're a Disney fanatic like me and your childhood dream was to be one of these great animators), and so much fun to explore, though there is thankfully an Index for when you don't feel like getting to things the long way.There are many classic Disney shorts on Disc 2 as well, emphasizing the importance of Disney's previous works in leading up to the masterpiece at hand. The Old Mill, Playful Pluto, The Goddess of Spring, Flowers and Trees, Babes in the Woods, Musicland, Steamboat Willie, and The Skeleton Dance can all be found on Disc 2. And a final couple of bonus features ported over from the previous DVD release are the delightful retrospective ""Disney Through the Ages"" and the ""Dopey's Wild Mine Ride"" game. The game is pretty fun, and the retrospective is very fun. It also includes many Snow White theatrical trailers to break up each of the decades talked about, each hosted by a different ""Disney"" personality. I must admit that I was a little miffed that my disc kept skipping during the Fess Parker/1950's section though. One always hopes the newest technology will leap the hurdles of flaws like skipping. It seems Blu-Ray isn't the technology to leap that hurdle, and I was watching it on a PS3, which are darn good players. Unfortunately, it's not as simple as saying I can watch this featurette on my old DVD if I really want to, as this Blu-Ray features an updated version with new segments hosted by John Ratzenberger, including a new decade! Well, it's a good feature anyway and I envy those who get to watch it unflawed. Oh, and there is one more bonus feature: a Heigh Ho sing-along. I don't get much use out of those as bonus features though. Can't we just turn on the subtitles during the film?All in all, this new Blu-Ray release of Snow White is outstanding and definitely a must own, even if it's a double-dip for you. I won't say it's without flaws though (and I'm not just talking about my skipping Fess Parker segment). There was a nice chunk of wonderful bonus features that were not ported over from the previous release, and there is just no excuse for that. Every new, grandiose release of a film on home video should include all the bonus features of its predecessors. That should be understood. Okay, games and things of that nature I can understand leaving off, but not deleted scenes, alternate songs, live action reference footage, and so on... This just means the true fan must hang on to his or her older release too, and that doesn't do much to encourage double dipping. But, again I say, this release is well worth it. It's a must have. But DON'T toss out your old Platinum Edition if you care about bonus features. The Diamond Edition has great ones, but it lacks some too. Most importantly though, the film itself has never looked better and belongs on the shelf of every film aficionado and Disney fanatic.Also recommended for fans of Snow White: Pinocchio, Bambi, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Black Cauldron, and all other Disney animated films! And go see The Princess and the Frog in theaters! More recommendations: Fantasia, Enchanted, Disney's Silly Symphonies (and the Walt Disney Treasures Collections in general), Snow White: A Tale of Terror, and all the Cannon Movie Tales, but especially Snow White in this case. There's also a Hallmark Snow White TV movie, but I only recommend it if you are entertained enough just enjoying the beauty of Kristen Kreuk (as I am known to be at times). Also often recommended to me is the mini-series ""The 10th Kingdom"", though I've yet to see it, and I know Filmation made a Snow White Christmas Special and their own Snow White feature sequel. I can't comment on those. I recently acquired them (they are available in one DVD set with Journey Back to Oz) but haven't gotten around to viewing them."	5.0	Ever and More Than Ever an Amazing Viewing Experience	2009-10-21	2	2	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A357V5F3KAMYK3	"M. Palmer ""Michelle P."""	"The classic Snow White story still lives to be an all-time favorite for children young and old.  This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter.  This story is told through classic characters.  For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters.  Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman.Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people:  Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse).Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well.  Famous songs from this movie are ""I'm Wishing,"" ""Whistle While You Work,"" ""Hi Ho,"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come.""A couple negatives in this movie:  I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince.  Snow White's voice was a bit annoying.Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene.  She mixes a potion and casts a spell.  There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.This particular disk gives lots of special features.  Audio commentary and a game; but my favorite was ""The Making of Snow White.""  You will get a lot of background information on the beginning of Walt Disney!  They also show you some scenes that didn't make the cut into the movie."	5.0	Excellent DVD set!	2012-10-06	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ	Mr. A. Pomeroy	Well, you know the film. I'm going to review the DVD, and it's quite a special DVD as well. For a start, the animation has been polished to within an inch of its life - the colours and so forth are extremely vivid, and although released in 1937 you can't tell from the film quality alone (the music and the 'look' of Snow White and the Evil Queen are very 1930s, however).As the above list indicates, there are rather a lot of extras. As with Lucasfilm, Disney often get a lot of bad press for being stingy -  this is Disney's equivalent of 'Star Wars: Behind the Magic', in that they've gone to the other extreme and including almost anything possible.Disc two has a couple of afternoon's worth of stuff, highlights of which include the various trailers dating back to 1937 ('See what the genius of WALT DISNEY has created!') and some galleries of concept art. It's odd looking at galleries of concept art from the 1930s - the animation and storyboarding 'work in progress' frames don't seem dated, and some of the throwaway pre-production illustrations are as gorgeous as anything in the film.The menus are very nice, but as with a lot of flashy menus (the ones for MGM's 'James Bond' films) they get a bit tiring the second time.There are deleted sequences, some audio clips, shots of live action test shots, short films on animation presented by Walt himself (looking surprisingly dapper), the works. There's even a short history of the Disney company itself, a piece of fluff which skims over the studio's dimishing artistic fortunes after the death of Walt, and has a blankly-smiling actress sum up the 80s as 'a decade of agressive investment and expansion!' and not, say, 'a decade of 'The Black Cauldron' and 'Tron''.Disc one has the film, Barbra Streisand (for two minutes), some games, and an intriguing audio commentary by Walt himself, assembled from bits of interviews. It's a bit muddy and hard to hear, but that's definitely his voice talking. I haven't actually listened to it all the way though, but it deserves a nod for the effort involved (unless, of course, it's all faked and Walt isn't really dead at all).To top it all, it's reasonably-priced. As a landmark in cinema, and as a classic Disney film, I can't think of a reason not to own it.	5.0	Dwarves, surely?	2001-10-23	7	6	1
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3J029KBNG5MNP	Mr. Bey	So far I've been amazed by what Blu-ray could do but when I heard that Disney was coming out with Snow White on Blu-ray I was a little skeptic. How much can Blu-ray really do to make a 72 year old movie look better than it did on DVD. The answer is a lot. Snow White looks amazing on Blu-ray and it really is shocking to see how up to date the animation looks. I won't bore you with a synopsis of the movie since you probably have seen it.For parents who have kids who haven't seen the movie this is a great buy as your kids will want to watch it again and again. Adults who haven't seen this classic in ages will get a lot out of this release as well. This is a great buy even if you don't have a blu-ray player since it comes with the DVD version as well. Blu-ray is the future so you'll probably end up getting one. It's nice to see Snow White look so new again.	5.0	Disney Classic Comes to Blu Ray	2009-10-15	4	2	2
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	This, the first full length animated feature, is undeniably a classic in its own right.  It's still one of the few Disney films that truly manages to capture the horror of its original source.  Grimm fairytales are notorious for their morose tone, and several of the more menacing scenes from the book are brought to life here.In the movie Snow White is draped in rough garments to hide her beauty from the jealous Queen, but when her magical mirror informs her that she is no longer the 'fairest one of all', she sends a huntsman to kill Snow White.  When our heroine manages to escape, her trip through the horrifying woods, with branches and hollows looming out at her from the shadows is stunningly realised.  When she is rescued by the seven dwarves, that movie becomes a little more comic.  Thankfully the dwarves are never overbearingly cute, but remain ultimately winning, especially the mute Dopey and stuck-in-his-ways Grumpy.The most important thing about this movie is though that it never veers too far in one direction.  It mixes light humour with inobtrusive songs and colourful scares.  In particular the Queen's transformation into a hag is just so well done that it would rival even some of Disney's later and more polished films.  There's even a little play with the subtext of the sexual feelings that Snow White evokes in her hosts.  This is a Disney movie to treasure.	4.0	Classic animated fairytale	2002-01-19	1	0	1

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A184EFWP7D688K	"Nancy Beiman ""Northernexpress"""	SNOW WHITE is an animation textbook as well as a history of one of the most famous films ever made.It is beautifully produced and gorgeously restored. The colors have never looked better.The Disney studio cleaned out their refrence library for the superb Gallery section, to the immense benefit of animation fans, animators, and animation students alike. It is also instructive to see footage which was cut at the last minute: this truly shows Walt Disney's particular genius, that of the expert storyteller. Which is all that matters when making a film--not just a feature length cartoon.My one complaint (as with all the new Disney discs) is that the artists who made the drawings are never identified except in one or two instances. There are discussions about background painter Sam Armstrong, and one character design of the Prince and Snow White was signed by Fred Moore and Hamilton Luske, but in some cases the artwork has appeared in books with the artist properly credited; and in two instances the artists are actually still alive and working for the Disney company. (Working in animation keeps you young.)Don't miss this one if you love animation, and love the movies.	5.0	A Gorgeous Achievement	2001-10-27	0	0	0

I love how you can get both the DVD and Blu-ray in the same package.  It is very convient to be able to watch it on Blu-ray but still be able to let others watch it who just have a DVD player.  The movie looked great.  It also came with extras to watch like:*First time ever in High Definition 7.1 sound, all new music video,Disneyview - Expanded viewing experience, Disney Family Plan - games for everyone to enjoy,backstage Disney - go behind the scenes of this legendary tale and classic Bonus features include Dopey's Wild Mine Ride Game, Karoke Sing A Long.  My family really like the games and karoke sing a long.  It is great to be able to watch a wonderful classic movie and they play fun games or karoke afterward.  I would definetly recommend this version of the movie.	5.0	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Diamond Edition	2009-10-15	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3DDPQ9342UNMY	"N. Doyle ""film buff"""	"My mother kept an old clipping for years describing SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS when it opened at the huge and prestigious Radio City Music Hall in New York City and received a rave review from newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler.He usually wrote about politics but on this occasion he took time to devote an entire review to Disney's new film. He called it a ""masterpiece"" and said that when the projectionist slipped those reels of film on the projector, the audience at the Music Hall witnessed one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.Coming from him, that was high praise indeed. And seeing the film now, restored for its video bow, we can appreciate his words. There are faults, to be sure, but basically it has to be admired for the innovative techniques it used in the art of animation. There are memorable sequences thanks to daring use of the multiplane camera: Snow White's flight through the woods, the Queen and her Magic Mirror, the Queen in the thunderous transformation scene as the camera seems to whirl around her, the Dwarfs in the mine and their march over the bridge as they sing ""Heigh-Ho"", the dwarfs chasing the witch in the thunderstorm. Even the rippling effects of the water in the wishing well scene.And, of course, there are the genuinely comic moments that made even the great Charlie Chaplin applaud in admiration. Dopey's antics are always a delight, as are Doc's and Grumpy's. All of the dwarfs are given inventive and funny things to do. The animation for the heroine herself is so gracefully done, particularly in the ""Yodel Song"" sequence where she dances with the dwarfs, that it's almost like watching a real ""Snow White"" go through the paces. That scene remains one of the most charming moments from the entire film with the dwarfs all displaying their own distinctive traits.The music is a standout: Someday My Prince Will Come, Heigh-Ho, I'm Wishing, The Yodel Song, etc. The young in heart will always love this classic. The art work is so rich in detail that the cottage scenes take on a life of their own, as do the images of the Wicked Queen at her castle.It belongs in the top tier of Disney's crown jewels, along with Pinocchio, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.Summing up: an inspired work of art on every level that will remain a timeless classic.Note: This review is based on the VHS and theatrical version of the film."	5.0	Still a Disney masterpiece...	2007-10-18	0	0	0

I admit I sometimes catch myself sitting down and enjoying it with him. I have a VHS version that I've had since a kid, but that is nothing compared to the true color and EXCELLENT restoration they did on the DVD version. Disney has really outdone themselves. As for it not being compatible, I play it on my Playstation2 and it works just fine (haven't tried a pc or xbox) I must encourage everyone to add this to your disney collection. One thing I didn't like though was some of that extra stuff they put in was pretty lame. The movie though was top of the line.	5.0	GREAT FOR ALL AGES	2001-12-27	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AZIFVX289JTS	Nick	Just like the release of thePinocchio Blu-ray, this is another amazing Blu-ray transfer by Disney. The image is perfect on every frame and true to the original, 70 year old, film (see below). The watercolor background images, throughout the movie, are simply amazing and crystal clear; you can actually see the texture of the watercolor paper.It makes me sad that the same kind of artistry used to make this film doesn't show up in films any longer. The time and talent spent making a film like this is truly becoming a lost art.The first time I watched the movie all the way through, I thought that I was seeing flaws in the picture quality (strange discoloration, odd looking artifacts, etc) but upon closer inspection, I realized that I was actually seeing the limitations of the painting technique originally used to make the movie. You can actually see the paint vary just slightly on some of the character's, especially in skin tones; I guess I've grown too accustomed to watching CGI with it's constant and perfect colors.Get this classic, it's worth it.	5.0	One Word: Incredible	2009-10-12	3	3	0

So Even the people who did not like the movie will get a kick out of some of the features.  I mean there are deleted scenes for god sakes.  I was not a big fan of Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs when I first saw it,  but watching everything on the dvd I have a big appreciation for what Disney did.  I actuall watched the dvd and it is absoultely fantastic.  Plus the Remastering of The Film and Audio tracks are first rate and it looks like it just came out yesterday.  That's how good it looks.  But before you run to the store to buy it rent it first and just watch the movie then buy it and watch the special features.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1NC8VDFNR8G4D	"Nicole Brady ""Nicole (SAHM Reviews)"""	"We don't own a Blu-ray player or a Sony PlayStation 3 (that plays Blu-ray), so why do we need a Blu-ray Snow White?  Well, for the first time in seven years, Disney released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I have it because I'm participating in the campaign to get the word out about it.  The complimentary copy that I received from One2One Network is the Diamond Edition which includes both the DVD and the Blu-ray in the same box.  While we don't have the ability to play a Blu-ray, we have a few DVD players, a DVD player built into a small TV, the XBox 360 that plays DVDs and a DVD player in the van.  We could totally make immediate use of the DVD that is included in the Diamond Edition and still be prepared for the technology upgrade should we ever decide to get a Blu-ray player or game console that plays them.In case you had never realized it, Disney has a Halley's comet method of releasing classic movies - every once in a long while.  I'm not saying that it's a bad thing.  Actually, from manufacturing and marketing standpoints, it's genius.  Classic movies probably aren't a perpetual high-sale item so short-run, high quantity, occasional releases limit dead-stock on shelves while also giving the marketing crew the ability to work the ""limited"" angle.  Essentially, what it does is make you decide if you really want the movie or not because like the commercials say ""Once it's gone..."" you don't know when it will be available again.I remember several years ago (well before I had kids) laughing at my aunt for her collection of Disney movies.  As each new one came out, she would purchase it.  She explained, ""I don't have grandkids now, but I will"" and that she wanted to make sure she had the movies when they were ready to watch them.  Until that time, I had never noticed that you couldn't just walk into a store and purchase any Disney movie of your choice.  I had always thought that ""get it before it's gone"" thing was just a marketing pitch.  But sure enough, ever since then, I've paid attention and watched movies come and go - usually re-introduced to accommodate the changing technology.  In this case, Blu-Ray.  Seven years ago, it was probably to introduce the movie in DVD format.  So seriously, when a Disney movie comes out that we might want, we consider if we want to buy it because we don't know when it will be available again!We sat down and watched the movie last weekend and my girls loved it.  They are familiar with Cinderella and several of the other Disney princesses, but despite having various Snow White toys and books, they just didn't relate to her.  For one of their birthdays, we got a Snow White figure set (Polly Pocket size) that contained a few outfits, four pair of shoes and two dwarfs.  The girls cast the dwarfs aside and welcomed Snow White into their Polly Pocket environment.  Never did I hear them refer to her as Snow White.  They just really didn't understand because they had not seen the movie and even though I've read the book to them, they just didn't gravitate to the characters.  We also own a Disney princess joystick video game that hooks up to the television.  I was always surprised that they didn't like playing the Snow White ""Hide and Seek"" game.  The day after we watched the movie that we received from One2One Network, the girls began to unearth all the various Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs paraphernalia that they had.  The sad part is that it has made me realize that just reading the stories in a children's book isn't enough to really bring the characters to life.  I'm wondering what other stories I read and movies I saw as a child my daughters haven't had the opportunity to fall in love with yet!Now about the movie itself... it's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs for Pete's sake.  I'm certain that you don't really need me to review it.  But the Diamond Edition DVD/Blu-ray combo pack does contain an exclusive look at the opening sequence of Walt Disney Pictures ""The Princess and the Frog.""  It also contains some family games as well as various backstage and bonus footage.  It's Snow White... it's a classic... it's worth introducing your kids to.... and all along, my aunt was right to purchase those videos before she needed them."	5.0	So THAT'S Who Snow White is?!	2009-10-27	2	1	1

We previously had Snow White on VHS and the difference between the two is astounding.In case you haven't seen Snow White, I have to tell you to beware as it is quite violent.  I watched it with my daughter and I was shocked at how much more violent it was than I remembered it.  The Wicked Witch orders the hunter to kill Snow White and cut out her heart.  There is also a seen in which the hunter is standing behind Snow White with a knife, in position to stab her.  So, this may not be the best movie to watch with your little one.  You might want to watch it first and fast forward through the scary parts when watching with a child.	5.0	Superb picture and sound quality	2009-11-19	0	0	0

The story is typical early Disney (what with it being Disney's first feature) with plenty of physical comedy and a handsome prince who wakes the dear maiden with a kiss.Definitely something for the kids, but not as accessible to adults as the early Disney shorts were. It's innocent and light and really rather harmless.Still, the special features are to die for and it's great to see the vault open (""for a limited time only~"") like they do every decade or so... a typical consumer would probably be safe with the only the DVD edition, the Blu-Ray being only necessary for collectors."	3.0	A Disney Classic come to Blu-Ray...	2011-06-21	3	2	1

It is average when Snow White remains silent, but when she talks I must admit to cringing. I give it two stars for the animal characters (I always liked the turtle) and Grumpy (the rest of the Dwarfs kind of freak me out). Also another thing that annoys me is that Snow White falls in love with the Prince after meeting him for two seconds (and kissing a bird) at a well, I don't think they even exchanged one real word, Cinderella had more contact than that with her Prince and that was pretty minimal. It really is the worst of the Princess movies, which I feel is too bad because it was the first and I really wish that I could like it, but I really can't.	2.0	The most annoying voice in Disney history.	2002-10-09	16	5	11

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1D663YD036KNH	paperbackriter	With the release of &quot;Snow White&quot; Disney has effectively raised the bar from which all DVDs should be judged. Personally, I spent four evenings sifting through all the extra features included in this hefty two-disc set. In a nutshell, &quot;Snow White&quot;, is loaded. Of course the film itself, Hollywood's first full-length animated feature, was truly groundbreaking when released in 1937. Created in a cloud of doubt, very few believed that Walt Disney could entertain an audience with an 84-minute &quot;cartoon&quot;.(See &quot;The Making of Snow White&quot; on Disc One) However, all naysayers grossly underestimated Mr. Disney's astute ability to weave a great story, memorable characters and classic songs into a visually stunning package. Disney practically begged for financial assistance to keep the project afloat and when it finally premiered in December 1937, &quot;Snow White&quot; defied all doubters to become the highest grossing film of its time. &quot;Snow White&quot; set the standard for all animation which followed and, remarkably, through the process of digital restoration, the film looks as though it could have been released just yesterday. The colors are intensely vivid and the clarity is unsurpassed. According to technicians who participated in the restoration, (see &quot;Restoration&quot; on Disc Two), the visual quality of &quot;Snow White&quot; on DVD is equal to that of the original animation cells. In other words, we are finally seeing this classic in its purest form.Merely owning a pristine copy of this all-time classic would be good enough for most. However &quot;Snow White&quot;, like the &quot;Matrix&quot;, The James Bond films and a handful of other loaded DVDs, raises the standards of home video. In a perfect world, all DVDs would feature the endless array of bonus features contained within &quot;Snow White&quot;. For those who are interested, below is a list of just a FEW of the extras:1)A compelling full-length audio commentary provided by Walt Disney himself (compiled from various interviews). For film buffs, Mr. Disney's insightful commentary may well be the most invaluable feature of the entire DVD.2)A 39-minute &quot;Making of..&quot; documentary.3) 40+ minutes of &quot;Disney through the Decades&quot; and short features such as &quot;How Disney Cartoons are Made&quot;, &quot;A Trip Through Disney Studios&quot; and &quot;The Restoration&quot;.4)Six deleted scenes.5)Trailers for each of &quot;Snow White's&quot; eight re-releases6)Various stills and storyboard sketches.If all this is too exhausting, and believe me there's a lot more, host Angela Lansbury will take you on a 20-minute &quot;Guided Tour&quot; which neatly highlights the best of the bonus features. Overall, a classic DVD treatment for a classic movie. &quot;Snow White&quot; has withstood the test of time and will, undoubtedly, continue to entertain audiences for generations on end.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3I4EX7TBWUT1U	"""patrick_mcknight"""	"Since I just recently purchased the DVD of this animated classic, this seemed like an appropriate time to write a review on this wonderful film.  Walt Disney's animated fairy tale is the movie by which all Disney films, and indeed all animated films must be compared to.I remember when I first saw this film in the theater as a kid (possibly on its 1987 release), I was completely blown away.  This film can stand up to the best animated films made today.  The wonderfully detailed animation is quite remarkable, especially when you realize that this was during the days when everything was hand drawn.  Even in this era of computer animation, animated films rarely reach this level of expertise.  The rich colours seem to jump at you out of the screen.  As for the songs, they are so well known that many people can hum them by heart.  ""Whistle While You Work"", ""I'm Wishing"", ""Heigh-Ho"", and ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" have all entered into public conscienceness.  I'll never forget the queen's terrifying transformation into an old hag.  Has anyone noticed the irony in the queen's needing to turn into an ugly hag in order to stay the fairest in the land?Disney doesn't forget to add some humour.  For a kids film with such grim subject matter (an evil queen trying to kill her step-daughter), humour is a vital necessity.  I love the way Disney gave each dwarf a distinct personality.  There's Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Bashful, and Dopey, all named for obvious reasons.  I loved the scenes where Sneezy's chronic hayfever causes the dwarves to be blown across the room like in a hurricane.  It's terribly amusing to hear Grumpy expressing disdain over Snow White's cooking (""Careful, it might be witch's brew!""), and Snow White's policy of cleanliness.  Then there's poor Dopey getting selected to investigate what it is that is laying upstairs.  The forest animals are not without moments of their own, the scene where the animals help Snow White to clean the dwarfs' cottage is one of the film's most delightful moments.All that being said, I have a couple of minor quibbles.  It occured to me that Snow White herself is rather poorly drawn.  Her features are all vague and without great detail.  It's odd that a film with such otherwise great animation could do such a poor job on its main character.  Also, the person who voices Snow White speaks in too high a voice.  But it's to this film's credit that such problems can only be noticed by nitpickers.""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'"" release in 1937 was unexpectedly timely.  In Europe, Hitler was viciously persecuting the Jews, while Stalin was conducting his brutal purges of suspected enemies.  The way the dwarves take in Snow White and shield her from the evil queen can be compared to the way brave and kindly people hid the Jews from Hitler's Gestapo.  But these comparisons are probably accidental.""Snow White and the Seven Dwars"" is not just a great family film, but one of the greatest of all films."	5.0	Disney's great animated classic	2002-09-27	0	0	0

My grandchildren that I babysit with watch it often. They are always wanting to take it home. I am ordering them one now. It is such a delightful movie and the young ones are so intrigued by it. They love the dwarfts and of course Snow White. This world would be so much nicer if only there were more movies like this instead of the blood and guts they see in other movies. Keep releasing more of these giants of Disney. They are wonderful. I have almost the entire collection. My grandchildren can hardly wait for Cinderella to be released.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2XPK6XCL0UH1S	"Paul Christensen ""gadget geek"""	"Disney is one studio that takes its time and carefully manages its releases. Partly, this is to create demand for titles with the expectation that they'll only be available for a limited time before ""going back to the vault"". And part of that wait is to do things right, and that clearly is the case with the Blu-ray release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.One thing that Disney did NOT do is over-restore this classic animated film. The Blu-ray restoration is as close as you'll get to the original presentation (in fact, maybe better given projector limitations in 1937 when it was released). What you see is every detail of the beautiful hand-drawn, hand-colored animation cels, and the watercolor backgrounds. And, Disney was equally accurate in its audio restoration - the 7.1 channel track does not over-process or attempt to create surround sound where it didn't exist originally. Rather, you get a clean room-filling presentation mostly from the front 3 channels.In a nice touch that more studios should do, Disney is also including the DVD version of the movie in the packaging. Alas, there is no Digital Copy for your computer (eg. iTunes) or portable media device (eg. iPod).And, many of the extras are Blu-ray restored as well. (Silly Symphonies in HD!)What could be improved?- well, sadly, this release is missing a few extras from the 2001 DVD, most notably a 40-minute interview with Angela Lansbury- navigation of the extras buried in the Hyperion Studio Tour requires you to navigate in and out of rooms- BD-Live content (once again) is lacking - who wants to wait 5 minutes to see more theatrical trailers you could see online on your computer?But none of these areas of improvement could take away from a stellar, true-to-the-original restoration of a timeless classic."	5.0	one word - WOW, would be perfect if not for missing extras	2009-11-14	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AX7317G153T8W	"P. Colin McGraw ""AV, Computer & EnviroTech Nut"""	"This is a great movie, the one that started Disney's long tradition of feature length cartoons! Chances are you're familiar with the movie itself, so I want to jump into the actual discs and their features.First, Blu Ray doesn't really enhance the experience much. This movie is hand-drawn using simple colors, so ""HD"" doesn't have as much to add to the visuals as it does with some other films. You have access to watch other Disney trailers online through BD Live, which I don't find all that compelling, though there is an interesting interactive documentary on the special features disc that is new for this edition.The movie itself has a cool ""Disney View"" feature that lets you fill the black bars on the side corners of the video with a Disney artist's paintings. For example, a forest scene shows trees on the side, while a building scene might switch to cartoon columns. I liked watching the movie that way and liked the overall package, but ultimately I came away feeling like I would have been just as happy with the DVD.I'm also a little disappointed that this movie didn't include a digital copy of the movie like many Blu Ray discs do nowadays. It would have been nice to be able to take the video with me on my iPhone for my kids.Overall, however, I recommend the movie. You may as well save a few bucks and go with the DVD-only version of the movie if you can find it, but it's worth the purchase."	4.0	Great Film, Unimpressive Blu Ray Quality/Special Features.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3NWF77HY3LTSI	"P. Dorr ""TiggerFan73"""	"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is THE classic Disney film. It was dubbed ""Disney's Folly"" because Walt Disney had sunk so much of his own personal money into a (the unheard of) feature length animated film. No one but Walt and his close band of animators thought the film would do well. Everyone was enormously surprised by the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The classic movie includes the classic songs, ""whistle While You Work"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come."" I am an avid Disney fan and this was the perfect addition to my movie collection. My purchase was made even better by the fact that it was a Blu-ray disc and a DVD combo pack. We will be taking a trip to Walt Disney World in the near future and this will be a perfect way to get into the Disney spirit as we drive.My only complaint is that the delivery was extremely slow. When I checked at the post office a couple of days after it was supposed to arrive, I was told that according to the postal records, it had just left the origin point that morning. I did have the movie two days later, but I was miffed because Amazon had sent me an email saying it had left their warehouse well over a week prior to when it actually did."	5.0	Great movie, slow delivery	2009-11-09	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1N4QU3ZIZZKRY	"Peace Village ""Hal Jordan"""	This movie is pretty deep.  I saw some of the symbolism discussed inThe Wisdom of Florence Scovel Shinn, which lead me to see it again.  This was a major risk for Disney, their first full length cartoon, and it was state of the art, for its time.  They had adults waiting for blocks, to see this.  You see elements of the 1930's in this, yes, but it is also timeless.  It is a classic, as much as the Howard Hughes films that set the standard.  It also put Disney solidly in the black, and on the path to produce more.  This is a classic.	5.0	classic	2012-07-01	1	1	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3VC95RF31K9LO	Pedro Rivera Farina	I have been buyin DVDs since last year, but no DVD left me as astonished as this one.First of all, I must say (a must say) that this is a spectacular film, one of the must beautiful disney's masterpieces, evey single person should see it. Kids will simply love it, as it is clean an lovable, I assume that every body has seen it, so, I will not bother you repeating it.The new audio tracks along with te restorated collor are great, as they are new and beautiful, but not making the restoration grotesque, it's a very soft restoration.The second DVD is another work of art, the scenaries are basically the queens castle beatufully rendered. inside of which you will find the art galleries and stuff. The galleries include the evolution of te characters from the begining up to those that were drawed, I mean,up to those that were brought to life by that genie that was walter disney. This disc includesthe original script of the tale (no animation :-( ), from the brothers greem.The only negative points the DVD has, are that the proof of purchase are on the back cover of the pack, so, if you want tho use them, you'll have to cut it, the othe is that the box is a tiny bit wider than any two disk set found elsewhere, but I think no one will care about it, I don't....This is a must buy for every body, this along with Dumbo will make your DVD collection a great one, Kid will love them as thy are the two best movies ever created by disney.	5.0	I can't believe the excellent work	2001-10-23	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2PWV7Y7AGT69S	"peter arteman ""john q private"""	"""Snow White"" was the first movie I ever purchased on DVD. It is more a work of art than a film. Watching SW on Blu-ray is an exercise in sensory overload, it is hard to know where to look for all the exquisite detail running throughout the movie. The scenes with the Queen/Witch brewing up her potion are a feast for the eyes, the dwarfs are fantastically well done (frankly, Miss White is the poorest rendering in the movie), and the scene of the 7 crying over SW's ""death"" is heartbreakingly beautiful. I do not know how Disney manages to produce Blu-rays of such astonishing quality, whether they work from carefully preserved prints or use magic Pixie dust in the transfer process but WHATEVER they do they do it better than anyone else: EVERY Disney Blu-Ray I have is impeccable. Snow White has no jarring edits, no quality changes from scene to scene, no jumping from one print to another with obvious sharpness or coloration variations, it really is like watching a first-run movie. Yes, $50 is a bit steep for 1 Blu-ray but if you think about it, what does that amount to over the years? If you watch it twice a year for the next 25 years it works out to $1 per view. I am so happy to have Miss White and all her friends in my Blu-ray collection and you will be too once you see this American Classic on your HDTV."	5.0	The greatest animated movie of all time on Blu-Ray!

Snow White has never looked as good as it does on this DVD edition - the film has been digitally enhanced from it's 1993 restoration.  Much like the Fantasia DVD - Walt Disney's own comments and interviews about the film have been edited into a feature length running commentary as an optional soundtrack to the film.  Additional features include sequences which were edited from the film, and documentaries.  The DVD is &quot;hosted&quot; by the magic mirror, and can walk even the most inexperienced DVD user through the features included.  This edition gives me high hopes for the additional Platinum titles which will come once a year.  Snow White goes on Moratorium in January 2002, after that it will not be available for ten years.	5.0	Platinum Snow White	2001-10-17	2	2	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2R1HAXRNU0QX7	RMurray847	Sometimes movies are labeled classic, and yet they date poorly. It isn't always the fault of the movie, but can be blamed on modern sensibilities.  Take a movie like THE LOST WEEKEND (about alcoholism).  It was a classic in its day due to its harrowing treatment of a subject that hadn't really been tackled by film up to that point.  But today, after dozens of TV movies on the subject, our ability to be moved by THE LOST WEEKEND is disappaited.  We have to tell ourselves as we watch it, &quot;Yeah, this is a classic.  Remember, this is the 1940s.  It must have been quite something.&quot;SNOW WHITE is the opposite.  It is a classic, a charming classic, all on its own.  A delight from start to finish. And telling yourself, &quot;This was made 80 years ago,&quot; only enhances the experience.  All children MUST see this movie.  As a 39 year old man,  I'm hardly the audience for it, but WOW, it still holds up.  There is minimal dialogue on the movie, yet the antics with the dwarves are so charming and funny, you just can't help but smile.  And the creepy scenes really are creepy.And you MUST own the DVD.  It is SO full of extras that you just won't see anywhere else.  Although perhaps not as mind-boggling as the extras of, say, LORD OF THE RINGS, the completeness is still pretty amazing.  This was the first movie to offer its extras in an organized manner, a &quot;tree&quot; of extras, if you will, and the DVD will be considered a classic too.	5.0	A CLASSIC THAT REMAINS A CLASSIC!	2003-01-20	2	2	0

She sits through every viewing with the happy involvement and enthusiasm of a first-timer. &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; doesn't have the visual sharpness and depth of color we see in contemporary cartoons and the heroine's singing voice is not likely to be emulated by very many youngsters, but the film stands up beautifully as a source of innocent entertainment and probably will continue to do so far into the future.	5.0	Disney at its classic best	2002-03-09	1	0	1
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"I was absolutely ecstatic to receive a preview copy of the Blu-ray edition of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES.  This is one of those films whose importance in the history of the movies is simply impossible to over emphasize.  While Disney had been one of the most important animators of the thirties, but by no means the only one.  The Fleischers were doing a string of utterly delightful short films as good or better than what was happening at Disney, not merely with Betty Boop and Popeye but a number of superb cartoon fantasies.  What separated Walt Disney from his fellow animators was producing a feature length animated film.  As has been recounted in a number of works on SNOW WHITE, many thought this was an incredibly Quixote film to make.  Most felt that it was going to be a failure, that most people would not be willing to sit through a long color.  Some of the reasons strike us as silly, e.g. that the bright colors would hurt the viewers eyes after a while and they would leave to rest their eyes.  (This may sound silly, but remember that in the years that this was being made, from around 1933 through 1937, most studios had only one or two color cameras - e.g., when Orson Welles was making CITIZEN KANE, RKO offered him one of their few color cameras, but he turned it down, preferring to do the film, but the offer showed how important the film was to RKO.)Luckily, SNOW WHITE was a huge hit (unlike the next few Disney feature length films, which turned a profit, but only a minor one).  And it is easy to see shy.  The film is a technical marvel.  Although it has been superseded by all of the films that have come after it.  What is astonishing is how close to perfect the film is in every aspect.The film looks absolutely spectacular on Blu-ray.  The colors have never looked better, but the real improvement is in the sound, which is crisper and fuller than ever before.  It has been reedited for compatibility with surround sound.  I've always loved SNOW WHITE, but I don't know that I've ever been as delighted watching it.  I'd seen it a couple of times in theaters as well as on VHS, but those prints were usually somewhat worn.  (Several fellow students and I went and saw this at a college film society; one of the students was the daughter of a major member of the Disney studios, a man who wrote screenplays for several of the major studios, designed some of Disney's major characters, and directed several films.)  The print here is not only perfect, a high def TV with a Blu-player and surround sound makes possible a viewing experience never before possible.SNOW WHITE features one of my favorite sequences in any Disney film.  The Huntsman has been ordered to kill Snow White and to that end he approaches her in the woods.  At the last second he is unable to carry his task out.  Instead, he warns her that her life is in danger and that she must flee to save her life.  So she runs immediately into the forest, where her terror turns everything she sees into a threat.  Logs in a pond appear to her as alligators.  Tree limbs are the arms of monsters who are trying to snag her.  Tree trunks appear to be ghouls.  Finally, in exhaustion she collapses in a small clearing, where menacing eyes look out upon her.  As she calms down the eyes are revealed to belong to bunnies.  And deer.  And chipmunks.  Quail.  Sparrows.  Bluebirds.  It is a wonderful sequence, as Snow White's imagination transforms the world into a savage and menacing place.One interesting feature of the disc is the so-called Disney View option in watching the movie.  You can either watch it in the original 4:3 ratio with black on each side or you can use the Disney View option, in which animator Toby Bluth (brother of Don Bluth) provides frames on each side of the image.  I was a bit dubious about this before trying it, but I have to confess that I like it a great deal.  I like that this is entirely optional.  I liked the results quite a bit, but I could understand if someone else did not.  The effect is very much like in older theaters where large curtains were opened just far enough to reveal the screen.  If you don't like it (my daughter and I both loved it), just opt for the 4:3 version.This Diamond edition does contain three discs.  The first is a DVD copy of the film.  The second is a Blu-ray copy.  The third is a Blu-ray bonus disc with both extras produced exclusively for this Diamond Edition and features that were produced for the previous DVD version of the film.  There are so many extras that it is difficult to list them all.  There are a great number that are intended for small kids and I'm going to pass on these.  I have close to no interest in those so I'll focus on the ones that I find especially interesting.  One especially interesting feature deals with what was intended as a sequel to the feature film, a short that was worked on but not completed, a project entitled SNOW WHITE RETURNS, in which the Seven Dwarves make a new large bed for Snow White.  I loved the feature on Hyperion Studios, where you got to go on something of a virtual tour of the site where SNOW WHITE was produced.  You see period photos of the various parts of the studio with interview clips from some of the people who worked there.Given the excellence of the film, the double versions, the large number of special features, and the historical importance of the film, this Blu-ray/DVD set is very nearly a perfect release.  Some Disney films (like the recently released PETE'S DRAGON) I can only recommend for small children.  But this is a film just about everyone should own.  If you have small children, you need it for them.  If you are a student of the history of film, you need it for the important role it played in the development of the medium.  And if you are a fan of great animation, you need it because this is the film that gave birth to the animated feature film.  And on top of this it comes at a really decent price.  This disc definitely falls into the ""Must Own"" category.By the way, not only did the film through its huge success make possible all future feature length animated films (though it is fascinating that other studios didn't immediately attempt to emulate Disney - both MGM and Warner Brothers had great animated departments that combined with the resources of the main studio might have been capable of making a feature length film), it inspired one live action film.  Howard Hawks directed BALL OF FIRE, based on a Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett screenplay.  In that film seven stuffy scholars engaged in writing an encyclopedia and living together in a Manhattan mansion provide temporary sanctuary to a gangster's moll on the run (played wonderfully by Barbara Stanwyck).  The film has also entered our consciousness in ways that make possible other narratives.  For instance, Snow White's singing to birds has been parodied in a variety of films, most memorably in SHREK (where Princess Fiona's warbling causes a bird to explode) and in Disney's own brilliant live action film ENCHANTED.  And it has become customary to refer to various people by the names of one or another of the Seven Dwarves."	5.0	A review of the new Blu-ray version of one of the truly great animated films	2009-10-01	14	13	1
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"Note: The review that follows is of the Diamond Edition of Snow White that includes DVD and Blu-Ray in a ""Combo Pack,"" accompanied by a wealth of special features that really are special. For reasons known only to Amazon, reviews of earlier versions - those that are of significantly inferior quality in terms of production values - are recycled for inclusion with reviews of the latest version. Note that two of the first three reviews now featured were posted in 2001.*  *  *I first saw this film in the Shore Theater in the Windsor Park area of South Chicago and have since seen it several dozen times in the VHS and subsequent DVD format. Snow White and Pinocchio are my favorite Disney feature animated films. I was delighted that Disney released the Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition of Pinocchio earlier this year and now we have the Diamond Edition of Snow White that includes DVD and Blue-Ray in a ""Combo Pack,"" accompanied by a wealth of special features that really are special. As a result of all-new state-of-the-art digital restoration and Disney Enhanced High Definition sound, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs once again possesses all of the magic that previous versions of Disney's first animated feature film do not.In an article about the Walt Disney Family Museum that appeared in The New York Times (October 1, 2009), Edward Rothstein observes: ""By the time [Disney] created his first feature-length work, `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' he had transformed the very notion of animation. Disney insisted that cartoons literally animate their world, bring it so thoroughly to life that even inanimate objects would react to events. He pushed his staff to strain for realism (and sponsored drawing classes in his studios). But he was interested in something more than reality; even tables and trees would display character."" I include Rothstein's insightful comments because the animation of otherwise inanimate objects is brilliantly enhanced by all-new state-of-the-art digital restoration. In the Blu-Ray format, the images in Snow White seem even more vivid than I what I recall seeing in a theater and the songs are much more enjoyable because of their presentation in Disney Enhanced High Definition sound.The plot is based on one of the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm, Wilhelm and Jacob, and the songs were composed by Frank Churchill (who also wrote the music for ""Dumbo"" and ""Bambi"") and Larry Morey (who also wrote the lyrics for ""Bambi."") Together they wrote over 25 songs for Snow White but (ironically) only seven were used. After the success of that film, Churchill was promoted to Supervisor of Music at the Disney Studios. There are several of Disney's core themes developed, notably the constant threat of evil and efforts to flee from it as well as the importance of trust and the power of faith. Moreover, whereas a castle or cottage is merely a residence, wherever one is able to be with loved ones is ""home."" Even the forest animals who live nearby become involved with household chores, soon after Snow White arrives at the dusty, disorganized sylvan ""pad"" shared by seven bachelors.  Given the fact that they haul diamonds from the mine each day, you'd think they could afford a cook and maid. Apparently not.Disney will offer this ""Combo Pack"" for a limited time only and it really does offer significant value-added benefits that include an all new music video performed by Sonny with a Chance's Tiffany Thornton, an exclusive sneak preview of The Princess and the Frog, ""What Do You See?"" and ""Jewel Jumble"" game exercises, newly discovered storyboards for ""Snow White Returns,"" a tour of Walt Disney's original Hyperion studios, and ""Dopey's Wild Mine Ride"" game. Even without any supplementary features such as these, however, this version (in either the DVD or Blu-Ray format) is, in my opinion, the most complete masterpiece of all the great feature-length animated films. None other combines as effectively his one does both drama and delight in terms of plot, character development, and music.In a review of Snow White for The New York Times in 1938, Frank Nugent wrote, ""Wars are being fought as the picture unreels; crimes are being committed; hatreds are being whetted; riots are being brewed. But the world fades away when M. Disney begins weaving his spell and enchantment takes hold."" In his biography of Disney, published in 2006, Neal Gabler observes that other critics ""cited the awesome power of the sheer technical achievement: the collaboration of the nearly six hundred employees who drew, inked, and painted the quarter-million drawings in what totaled two hundred years' worth of man-hours. While no animated cartoon had ever looked like Snow White, and certainly none had packed its emotional wallop, it was also true that in none would the investment of time, energy, and devotion be so palpable. In some respects it was the cinematic equivalent of a Gothic cathedral - only in this case all the man-hours were expended in service to one man's vision rather than God's glory.""Most of those who see this film could not care less about its cultural significance, nor about its seamless integration of theme with technology, of inspiration with execution. They will almost immediately be delighted by the lead characters and enchanted by the life they share. Now restored and enhanced, Snow White once again has the technical brilliance and emotional power that were premiered at the Cathay Circle Theater on the evening of December 21, 1937. According to one observer, Bill Peet, ""everyone in that first Snow White audience could have predicted the enormous success of the film. They were carried away by the picture from the very beginning, and as it went along everyone was bubbling over with enthusiasm and frequently bursting into spontaneous applause."" To the best of my knowledge, no other film made more than 70 years ago continues to have the same impact that it did when first released. If that isn't ""magic,"" I really don't know what is."	5.0	All of its original magic has been fully restored	2009-10-03	4	4	0

True, I have quite a few dvd sets, but I am a diehard vhs fan with many still in current library and thanks to JVC for great dual systems to play alternate formats on one unit.What I like about the discs are the compactability for on the go units such as laptop video units which I also have two of, and play very well, both Sylvannia & Go Video, so the convenience of watching my favorite movies or tv shows on discs is great. I also like the internet movies, but the discs I can view anytime and anywhere, and being my laptop videos are also battary operated is an added plus.The features to these disc sets are also great, although I do find I dont have much time to look at everything, but I get them just in case the day comes I need extras to watch instead of the same film fare.The recent Pinocchio platinum release just goes to show Disney movies just seem to get better with the revolution of video formats because the studios do extra enhancements to the film footage which make the color and sound vibrant with clarity.The only complaint I have ever had with vhs format was the lack of freedom to skip randomly, and the need to ""rewind"" after each viewing whether the film has been entirely viewed or not.So I look forward to another disney classic in my firm grasp such as this Snow White feature. It was a techno animated pioneer of its day when it introduced the first long length cartoon film which recieved many awards from the Academy. The animation still looks splendid with the effect of water color in landscapes. The songs are historical with Hi-Ho, and I cant count how many references Ive seen from many other non disney movies in regard to Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs lingo.The intro scene of the queen consulting her magic mirror is the staple to disney villains. Snow White's eerie tree sequence as she escapes from henchman is still compelling and transfers well to the honored ride in Disneyland itself.There are many historical facts to the making of Snow White as the frame by frame coloring of Snow White's rosey cheeks which was painstakingly done by disney artists. It's also a hoot to watch the live footage of men dressed as dwarfs which helped animators with the dance sequence. The queen transformation to the evil witch hag is one of the best fright night bits in movie history as her witch makes the biggest impression alongside the Wicked Witch of the Witch in Wizard Of Oz.The final scenes of the dwarfs dealing with the poisoning of their princess is very well done and incredibly animated with reverence.Snow White's prince, however, makes a very slight appearance throughout the movie and barely becomes much of a standout character because he is not given much to do other than become the apple of Snow White's eye (couldn't resist).Needless to say, the seven dwarfs are the real stars because they are personality plus, and the cute animals all around are the charming backdrop to the whole feature."	4.0	Still the fairest of Disney	2009-09-16	4	2	2

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1TTFG1PVGXWIP	Rocky Boat	"As a kid growing up in the late 80's-early 90's, I had a pretty respectable collection of Disney videos and was eager to put my hands on the ""first and fairest of them all"" - the film that Disney has been keeping so tight in the vault, more than once stating that they might never release it on home video. Have times changed or what? Unfortunately, kids today can watch the whole film online by a mouse click! Anyways, it was late 1994 and my parents finally bought me the tape. Like its 4 immediate successors, Snow White has a dark tone to it. I applaud the animators for their hard work. There would be an improvement in human movement in Pinocchio, but its still top-quality animation. The queen steals the show and her scenes are the highlight of the movie, as is the case in many Disney films. In contrast, the heart of the movie which is the dwarfs getting to know Snow White, feels somewhat slow-paced and had me a little bored. Whereas ""Snow White"" received a fantastic restoration in 2001, this one takes it a bit too far. Like with the Blu-Ray release of Pinocchio (those two greatly resemble in their artwork and color shades), the backgrounds look like they were brightened too much to reveal spotty walls that were not as visible before (In Pinocchio it's very apparent in Geppetto's workshop). Still, Snow White remains a visual feast. It should be a part of any Blu-Ray collection."	5.0	The Very First Disney Classic	2011-05-07	2	1	1

Beautifully done, and very true to the Grimm tale. However, it has one of the most disturbing subjects in a Children's story  I have ever heard. The stepmother sending out a Huntsman to cut out her heart?!?! Then trying to poison her. And the forest scene is outright terrible. Not recommended for kids under 12, in my opinion. I was scared for a long to time to watch that after the first time. It took me 5 years to see it again after I was 8 yrs old.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	APBNLLYCJM8YE	"Roy Anderson ""War Buff - and civilian combatt..."	Who hasn't heard of Snow White? A Classic ever since Grimm included it in his legendary Fairy Tales. The simple tale of a wicked Queen who, because of being jealous of the beauty of Snow White, forces her to flee her palace home and find refuge in a cottage deep in the forest. The cottage is home for a group of disparate little people who work in a mine in the forest. The cottage is in a shambolic shape - which Snow White puts right. The little people and Snow White live idyllically - until the Queen tracks her down and poisons her with an apple. Much sadness ensues, until a handsome Prince arrives and, with a kiss, revives the drugged Snow White.The scenes, in and of the forest, are simply magnificent. No wonder that Walt Disney became a household word and his new form of cinematography became so world famous that it survives long after his death.  Snow White started a cinematographic genre. Long may children be absolutely delighted and thrilled by it.This DVD is as close to perfection as I have ever come across.	5.0	The perfect template for the magical world of superior animation.	2010-01-07	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A37DZX4F5RU2PQ	Sarita Dutta	"""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"" this has perhaps become the most famous question ever asked in a fairy tale. And in 1937, this was the question with which started this exalted masterpiece; a magical motion picture that bewitched millions of spectators worldwide and started a new trend of entertainment.When Walt first began his ambitious project with a loan of 1.5 million dollars from the Bank of America, critics termed it as 'professional suicide'. Disney studios were well renowned for giving to the world the first cartoon in full color and also the first cartoon with sound (Steamboat Willy). Most critics predicted that Snow White would be a box-office failure. They argued that cartoons were only meant to last ten minutes, filling the gaps in the programme rather than becoming the main attraction. They branded Disney's ambition ludicrous and foolish. But their predictions were proved wrong. At its premiere on 21st December 1937 at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, the celebrity-packed audience applauded all the finest sequences. Snow White instantly became a worldwide hit of magnetic proportions, starting a saga of magic which soon grasped the whole world; launching a series of Snow White dolls, figurines, books and vinyl records.Walt's achievement was recognized by Hollywood in 1939, when Shirley Temple presented him with a special Oscar. It was unique, consisting of eight figures - one large Oscar and seven miniature ones. Since then, Snow White has become a cherished classic loved by people of all ages.The animation, though traditional, is matchless in its grandeur. And considering that in those ages, every single cel had to be hand-painted; one can say that Snow White is nothing short of visually spectacular. Entailing the tiring labor of some 750 artists who painted over a million cels; (only 2,50,000 were used in the finished film) this classic came to life. The music composed by Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline and Paul Smith is richly melodious and vibrant; the score and the songs really beautiful. From the dwarfs' 'Heigh-Ho' to Snow White's 'Whistle While You Work' and 'With A Smile And A Song' to the prince's 'One Song'; each tune has its own splendor. 'Someday My Prince Will Come' is soothingly melodious, and has indeed become a timeless classic (though I don't quite like the Barbra Streisand rendition of it).The characters are astoundingly brought to life by brilliant vocal performances. Walt had himself chosen Adriana Caselotti as the voice of Snow White, and her classical numbers are exceptional. Lucille Laverne is the perfect choice for the voice of the queen and witch. Broadway star Harry Stockwell provides a wonderful voice for Prince Charming; and Pinto Colvig and Roy Atwell portray Grumpy and Doc very well.An eternal masterpiece, Snow white has something for everyone. It transports us to a realm of innocence and wonder; and we lose ourselves in this enchanted world. It is a conglomeration of fun, beauty, warmth and romance that really touches the very bottom of your heart.The 2-Disc platinum edition DVD is one of a kind, offering a breath-taking anamorphic full-screen transfer of this magical fairy tale, accompanied by an equally awesome Dolby 5.1 surround sound (the DVD also provides Dolby 5.1 French and Spanish language tracks). The bonus features are numerous (Disc Two having a total running time of 190 minutes); offering and in-depth look at the movie itself and how it was made. There are vast virtual galleries, early presentation reels, vintage audio publicity, a very nice set-top game and guided tours by Roy Disney and Angela Lansbury. The abandoned concepts and deleted scenes are a special joy to watch and the celebrity-hosted feature 'Snow White Through The Decades' is very informative and entertaining. I had to import the DVD from US and must say that it was worth every bit of my money. However, Disney studios have discontinued the title from the 31st of January, 2003, and the ones on Amazon.com have also gone out-of-stock. So if you don't yet have a copy of this classic, go get it now. I love this timeless masterpiece and will prize it always."	5.0	THE FIRST OF THEM IS STILL THE FAIREST OF THEM ALL	2003-08-04	1	1	0

While yes - the extras were great, and I discovered the soup song for the first time, what thrilled me most was the film itself. I was pretty surprised to see some complaints over the animation - for to me, this is the most perfect of all Disney animations. I find the more modern films like &quot;Beauty &amp; the beast&quot; to render the feature corners a little too sharp. The dwarfs are perhaps the most enjoyable part of the whole film with Dopey an obvious favorite. And Snowwhite is my favorite princess too !! And like the icing on the cake, we have the superb music - perhaps the best of all Disney soundtracks. While every song is a delight, my greatest favorite is &quot;With a smile and a song&quot;.

Inside there is a six page foldout navigation chart which lists all the features on the Blu-Ray disks. I would list everything on the navigation chart but it would take too long.My favorites include Backstage Disney Hyperion Studios which takes the viewer back to 1937 and the creation of  this movie. This includes rare footage and mini-documentaries, which is as much fun for adults as for children. Snow White Returns is a fascinating feature where uncovered storyboards outline a possible sequel to Snow White.There are plenty of fun things on the disks like four Disney Family Play features to play with after the movie.  There are a couple of nice music videos that are classic Disney.The only extra on the dvd is an audio commentary by Walt Disney. This was enjoyable. Considering all you get with the Blu-Ray disks I figured there would be few extras on the dvd.Best of all the picture quality on the all the disks are amazing both on my Blu-Ray players and dvd player. It is hard to believe that the original film goes back to 1937.The price is great. This collection will give both adults and children many hours of enjoyable viewing.	5.0	Disney at its Best.	2009-10-14	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A27NTH2Y9DAR31	Schuyler V. Johnson	Disney animators worked for years on the Silly Symphonies honing their skills, and Snow White is the result. The artwork, animation and background, are simply exquisite, and the colors are breathtaking. Every skill available at the time was lavished, lovingly, on every frame of the movie, and the first time a &quot;cartoon&quot; was evocative and actually affected people to the point where tears were shed over a character drawn by hand. The premiere was &quot;star-studded&quot; as they say, and Charlie Chaplin, John Barryomre and every celebrity of the day were in attendance, which says something about the respect and admiration inspired by the Disney name even then. It is said, in a Disney book, that when the Evil Queen was seen punting down the river, in the mist, Barrymore leaped in his seat from excitement; never had anything of this calibre been seen, and it was greatly appreciated and revered, as well it should be. There is a shot of a bar of soap (when Snow White states no dinner until they wash) that was painted in such rich detail it is astonishing, and there is a picture of this in one of the Disney animation books...extraordinary. Looks like you could pick it up, and it looks wet and worn. There was a problem with Snow White lookling too pale and washed out, and the ink and paint girls tried every shade of paint they had; but they were all too noticeable; a faint blush was what was wanted and the ink and paint girls rubbed real rouge onto the face of SW... the effect was perfect, but then Walt was concerned that they would not be able to place the blush where it should be frame to frame; they said &quot;That's what we do!&quot; and so, that is how Snow White got such a lovely, natural blush. The transformation of the Wicked Queen into the Wicked Witch is one of the most amazing effects ever put on screen and truly extraordinary for 1937. The Cottage of the Seven Dwarfs is just beautiful, placed in a glen in the forest, and the detail throughout the interior is astonishing; the stairs are carved, the organ is carved, and there are faces carved into almost everything in the cottage. The wood looks like wood; this &quot;cartoon&quot; has TEXTURE. At the end, after Snow White bites the poisoned apple and &quot;dies&quot;, there isn't a &quot;dry eye on the house&quot;, and when the Prince comes and wakes her and they ride off to his Castle in the sky, it is one of the most satisfying, moving moments in film. This one was, and is, the cornerstone of all Disney animation to come, and an absolute must for your DVD library.SIDENOTE:When Snow White premiered in New York, for publicity, Disney hired seven dwarves to tromp around on top of the theater marquee...all went well until the afternoon when it got hot, the dwarves got bored and thirsty and had booze sent up; well, they all got staggering drunk, took all their clothes off (and relieved themselves over the side, much to the discomfort of hapless passersby) and started fighting...the police were called and hauled them all away in pillow cases...true story.	5.0	THE ONE THAT STARTED IT ALL...	2004-01-27	2	2	0

It took 750 artists to work and perfect an amazing 250,000 drawings to bring this fairy tale classic(by the Brothers Grimm)amazingly and astonishingly to life.Producers and other cynical Hollywood scoffers(and there were many)stood awestruck at the finished result. The film made a mint financially and won Disney a special Oscar in 1938 (it was presented to him by Shirley Temple) The voice of Snow White was eloquently provided by Adriana Caselotti ;the Evil Queen was vocalised by the great Lucille LaVerne.

The previous restoration was commendable but artificial-looking; the image was cleaned but the result was too bright and antiseptic, robbing the film of its vintage, warm patina. (Imagine antique woodwork stripped and bleached and you'll get the idea.) This new DVD uses more recent technology to balance the contrast, brightness, color values, and soundtrack elements, and the video and audio technicians have done themselves proud.  There is a wealth of additional material, including rare reference footage, out-takes, session recordings, radio broadcasts, coming-attractions trailers, promotional films (including one assembled by Disney in two days for the RKO sales force, whose own short is also included), and recollections by those involved in the original production. There are also closed-captions and an alternate version in French (fascinating in itself, with superb dubbing). The &quot;magic mirror&quot; serves as the user guide, directing the viewer to the various menu features. (And if you don't follow his instructions, the mirror scolds you with a few pointed remarks!)

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2JAGHR2MLUX96	"See Em Gee ""Mr Gee"""	"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is beautiful and wonderfully restored/updated, it alone deserves 5 stars. HOWEVER, I'll take off two stars as the packaging is a RIP OFF; Disney should be ashamed of their marketing technique. I am not a Blu-Ray owner nor will I ever become one, but I had to buy 3 discs in this Platinum edition, instead of only the one I needed. The film plays great and is a joy to watch, but there are no extra DVD features for me - there is a commentary (I don't consider that an extra), a sneak preview (is advertising really an extra?) and a music video by someone I never heard of and which I'll never watch. Apparently there are many more extras on the Blu-Ray discs but I can't see them.In this time when we all should be ecologically minded, Disney has produced two extra discs for many buyers who will never use them. What a waste, not to mention I PAID EXTRA FOR THEM. I'm glad Blu-Ray users will enjoy the extra spectacular picture and sound but what about other people?DISNEY IS DISHONEST on it's package by not describing the movie format correctly -  the graphic depiction of a movie frame is shown widescreen - but the movie is in STANDARD FRAME (1:1.33). A fact I knew but I found it only stated in very small print towards the bottom of the box. It is also MISLEADING in listing the extras as they don't say that the extras are for Blu-Ray ONLY. I would have loved to see Backstage Disney and the old extras contained on the earlier DVD version, nope, just for Blu-Ray.Disney has this ""feature"" called Fast Play - if you don't press the right button to proceed directly to the main menu, the DVD will play its collection of coming attractions - a device aimed at children to see more things they can get their parents to buy.I'm very upset by this waste of materials and the extra amount I paid for things I won't use. I was forced to do it if I wanted a copy of this movie I've waited years for, a digitally restored film which in itself is a beautiful work of art, but we should have a choice of what version we want to buy and Disney should be more responsible to the environment, after all they will sell many millions of this things.A big company like Disney should be more responsible but obviously they are thinking MONEY and how to make the most they can, rather than think of how best to serve its customer base (and the world)."	3.0	Platinum Packaging is a ripoff for NON Blu-Ray User	2009-10-07	20	7	13
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3UI9IRG5SLUI7	Sera Elisabeth	This is the very first Animated Feature Film ever created from pure fantasy with help from the Brothers Grimm and the talented Walt Disney.  When it came to childish fantasy and whimsy, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was born unto the  mind of a very gifted man .  Children and adults alike toyed with the idea, year after year, out of every masterpiece Walt ever made which feature would be better than the next.  In 1937 his first achievement grew beyond the distant horizon and started a phenomenon to this day that is irresistable !Voiced my Adriana Caselotti, 14 year old Snow White was the the heroine of this fantasic tale.  The seven little men were drawn and voiced excellently by 1937's finest animators, comedians and actors including Pinto Colvig also known as the voice of Goofy.  Now known  as the 9 Old Men, these animators were put into school and taught on a regular basis at night, and working the on feature film Snow White, during the day all around the clock for the finest quality Walt Disney could ever ask for.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs jump started the Feature Animation department for what is widely known now as the Walt Disney Studios. It also gave a basis for 1939's inspired Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum.  Contributing now to all these factors and  many, many insightful more I give this movie.5 STARS !	5.0	Still The Fairest of Them All : Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs	2002-06-12	2	2	0

Viewing now the bluray on a large LED in the comfort of a home environment the cartoon movie is more beautiful than ever before. How the audio people took a mono sound track and made it into 7 channel sound is beyond belief. Individual orchestral instruments have a definite presence with the vocals also enhanced. There is rumbling bass when called for (but not too much). We decided it best to view Snow White and her little helpers on normal 4:3 format and not the so called Disney View where the black edges are filled by varying coloured art-work....this sort of takes away the attention from the movie itself.Loved those ""extras"" so many infact that some had to be included on the feature disc.Those at Disney should consider actually making the proposed ""Snow White"" II, sketchy details of which were shown on the extras disc.Stephen J FleayBandung Java Indonesia"	5.0	"after all these years ""simply brilliant""!"	2010-06-05	2	2	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	"It's so wonderful to live in a time when Disney's strange behavior of taking their classics off the market can be circumvented by great Internet marketers like Amazon. I was able to buy this 5 Star Disney Princess classic recently for my young princess through one of Amazon's third-party sellers. And without that opportunity, my little princess may have outgrown Snow White by the time Disney released it again.Let me just say that my little one was absolutely captivated by Snow White, and to think that she would be deprived by Disney itself from seeing it at her perfect age is criminal.The story is familiar enough to any parent, so I won't go on about that other than to say that of all the Disney Princess classics, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty have some scenes that might scare a young princess under the age of 5.But you should take advantage of purchasing Snow White or any of the other ""off-the-market"" Disney princess classics like Beauty and the Beast now via one of this site's resellers if you have a little princess of your own that might not appreciate it as much when Disney decides that it's time.And indeed, you will enjoy Snow White or any of the other Princess classics as thoroughly as your young one.Side Note on Resellers: Beware of exorbitant reseller prices; renting may be a better option if available.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3R8PXSFGY9MC2	Spider Monkey	When you talk about classic animation it doesn't get much more revered or classic than `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. The animation here is simply beautiful, even by today's standards, and this is all the more impressive when you take into account the year this was made, 1937. Even better, it is now digitally restored for it's latest release. This is a wonderful fairytale that is full of charm, none of which has diminished over time. This has the delightful dwarf characters and each one adds something unique to the film, of course Dopey is the most hilarious and the one that had me laughing out loud regularly. These dwarfs have now become representative of Disney's early art and are still seen around the parks and on advertising even today. This film has a dark edge to the story that is lacking from the saccharine modern Disney films and this darkness compliments and highlights the light in the rest of the film and in my opinion it is all the better for it. There are nice animated touches throughout, like the detailed carvings in the dwarf house and the forest animals expressions and actions and show the attention to detail Disney brought to his films. This package includes various extras and games, most of which are aimed at kids, but there is a commentary by Walt Disney that is fascinating and of interest to an adult audience. All in all this is classic and beautiful film and well worth adding to your Disney collection.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.	5.0	Disney Classic	2011-01-17	1	1	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A1C9GCHR99WX3F	Stephen Verhaeren	If you are confused by the title, it is supposed to be The one that started it all and still the fairest in the land. This was the first animated movie ever, and who knows if animation would ever be around if Mr. Walt Disney hadn't. And the has been a lot of animated movies that came out since, (too many to count) and Mr. Disney was around for most of them until his death in 1966. As the movie opens, a book opens and tells what happens to Snow White before the book is not seen. Every day Snow White's (Adriana Caselotti) stepmother the queen (Lucille La Verne) askes her magic mirror (Moroni Olsen) who the fairest in the land and the answer is the same every day, it is the queen, until one day when the Queen asks the same question again. But this time the mirror gives clues to Snow White. The Queen is so mad that she sents her huntsman to kill Snow White. But the Huntsman can't do it, so he tells Snow White to run away and never come back. (That part so like 1994's The Lion King). There was only one animated movie that was nomianted for best pitcure and that was Beauty and the Beast.	5.0	The one that started it all and still the fairest in the lan	2002-11-21	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3U56M0Y8LYO6J	"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict"""	"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" already owns a cherished place in cinematic history.  As the first feature length animated film made, it will forever be credited with expanding the possibilities of the medium.  Understandably, as a first effort, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" comes across as simple, underdeveloped, and devoid of self-awareness compared to modern animated fare.  Yet this is precisely why it has maintained its charm throughout the years.  This film harks back to a simpler era when motion pictures were more concerned with creating magic on screen and less concerned with being relevant.  It is a work filled with passion and assembled with tender, loving care.  It is a work that has stood the test of time and which continues to endure.Surely everyone is familiar with the Snow White story by now.  Snow White (Adriana Caselotti) is a young and beautiful princess who must escape to the woods to avoid being harmed by her wicked stepmother, the Queen (Lucille La Verne).  She takes refuge with seven dwarfs who each possess an apt unique name but a poison apple puts her under a harmful spell.  Thankfully Prince Charming (Harry Stockwell) arrives and, with a single kiss, thwarts the Queen's evil scheme and provides the requisite fairy tale ending.Even though this film was released in 1937, the animation still looks magnificent today.  All of the character move fluidly and the attention to detail in the backgrounds are amazing.  The voice talent all distinguish themselves even though Snow White's voice sometimes gets on your nerves.  Yet, that aspect of the film is more than balanced out by the wonderful singing scenes with the dwarfs and the strong characterization of the evil Queen.  While later Disney films have surpassed ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" in technical and narrative terms, their first animated venture still remains a jewel in the Disney crown."	3.0	"""Magic Mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"""	2003-07-20	2	1	1

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A29RZ88ME47XEK	Straight Shaun	Finally, finally, FINALLY, Disney is releasing one of their films with a format, media and extras that do it justice. I'm an adult (most of the time), with no kids, but I still can't buy and receive this DVD soon enough; I think it has to be the best value of the year. I don't personally really care for Disney's more recent efforts, but there's no denying the magic of its early works, and Snow White is the perfect title to kick off this incredible-sounding Platinum Collection.One thing that I have never been a fan of, though, has been Disney's marketing and sales schemes (VHS and DVD alike), and these Platinum titles, while finally doing justice to both the movies and the fans, will likely just add to the overall confusion for most buyers. The Limited Edition and Gold Collection DVD's already released are somewhat substandard; they are generally devoid of any extra DVD features and often are shortchanged technically (lack of widescreen or surround audio when available, etc.). They certainly don't hold a candle to the upcoming Platinums, which features tons of extras, innovative and wonderful-sounding DVD navigation schemes, incredible color and sound enhancement, and pretty much everything a fan could hope for in a Disney DVD. However, this being Disney, not everything could be good news of course, and with the Platinum Editions, the bad news comes with the ridiculous marketing plan for them; 1 per year for the next 10 years (Snow White being the first of 10). Until Disney to come to its senses and shortens that moronic release timeframe, however, we at least can have a taste of the incredible potential in this line with this first release.Whether you were lucky enough to have a childhood touched by the magic of the early Disney classics, or if, like me, you weren't that lucky but have the alternate fortune of experiencing these titles for the first time with these mind-boggling Platinum Editions, this should be the easiest, most no-brainer DVD purchase you make all year. And for those able to pre-order and get another DVD for free (Limited/Gold Edition, but still), the deal becomes almost criminal to pass up.Thank you, Disney, for what you're giving fans with this wonderful new line of Platinum titles.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AJKAZ50Y34PW0	"SuperOdie34 ""Dacey"""	Okay, before I begin, I should tell you that this isn't a review of the movie &quot;Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs&quot;. I'm gonna be talking about the bonus stuff included on the DVD!&quot;Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs&quot; is the most advanced DVD I have ever seen. Even though that alone might not say much, (Our family curently owns only 5 DVDs) I can tell it's great judging by what the other people are saying. The movie itself has been fully restored, and it looks better than it ever did before!Disc One of the DVD contains the film, as well as audio commentary by Walt Disney himself (I know he would be proud of just how great this DVD is). The forty minute &quot;Making Of Snow White&quot; is also great. And the new version of &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot; is so good, it might put Snow White herself to shame.My favorite part of the DVD just might be the great trivia game, &quot;Dopey's Wild Mine Ride&quot;. Players have to help Dopey gather the other dwarfs from the mine to help him save Snow White. It's a thriling experience!Disc Two of the DVD is also great. The deleted scenes just might be the best part, and there are surprisingly alot of them. Some are fully animated! Another treat is the &quot;Disney Through The Decades&quot; film: It not only let's us see what's been hapenning with Disney through the years, but it also let's us see &quot;Snow White's&quot; original trailers. The first one doesn't even show any actual scenes from the film.There's much, much more on this DVD, but I don't want to spoil it all for you. But I will tell you that after watching some of this DVD, I have a new respect for &quot;Snow White&quot; that I never thought I'd have!	5.0	not a &quot;Dopey&quot; DVD...	2001-11-15	7	7	0

Yet when I watch a wonderful classic film like this all is forgiven. One caution the movie could be frightening to very young or fearful children. The Queen and her mirror are really scary as are her various plots to kill Snow White. I don't think the typical kid over seven would be afraid of it especially since there is so much comic relief from the dwarfs and the cuddly animals though the film is somewhat of a curious mix. I do find Snow White's singing and speaking voice annoying as well as her role of little homemaker but you have to remember she is a product of the late 1930's and appreciate the film as a hallmark of that time."	4.0	Even a jaded Disney viewer should like Snow White	2006-09-23	2	2	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2QR035HCPBSLC	"The B ""ahnonamis"""	"Seventy two years ago, Walt Disney released his vision: an animated feature length film that would go on to create an entire industry, and become arguably the most influential film of all time. That movie? The iconic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.Snow White's story is timeless, and although it may be taken from fairytales, Disney's adaptation and interwoven music gave it new life, ensuring it would entertain generation after generation. It started out as ""Disney's Folley,"" but it became something more important than even Disney himself could imagine: a timeless piece of human culture, and a testament to the power of human creativity.It's almost impossible to critique the actual movie itself, without taking all of that into account. It's not the most complex film; it doesn't have the greatest character development or plot. For those who haven't seen it - hopefully you're just all young and have a legit excuse - Snow White is about... Well, Snow White.She's a beautiful princess, living with her evil stepmother, the Queen. The Queen has a magic mirror, and asks it constantly who the fairest in the land is. The mirror, fearful of the Queen, would always say she was - but one day it answers that Snow White is fairest of all! True to her self-centered nature, the Queen orders her huntsman to take Snow White into the woods and kill her. Not wanting to harm her, the huntsman lets Snow White go, urging her to stay in the woods. It's there that she meets a group of seven dwarf miners, moves in with them, and the rest is history.Like I said, it's not the most complex story - or even truly original. But the way it's presented, with fantastic music and animation that remains breathtaking three quarters of a century later, it's impossible to not love the movie. It may not seem as influential today as it did back then, but there's no denying the mark Snow White has had on children throughout the world; on the animation industry; on Disney itself; and on the world.With the new Diamond Edition release, Disney is taking a new approach, including both Blu-ray and DVD formats in the same packaging. It may seem like a waste, but it's ingenious, really; people who buy the DVD because they have no Blu player suddenly find themselves with a Blu version, and people who buy Blu will have a DVD version to give to friends, use on trips, or watch in other rooms.Whether you buy the DVD or Blu-ray packaging, you're going to get the same contents: one DVD, and two Blu-ray discs, with one being the film and commentary, and the other hosting most of the features.With that all out of the way, let's get to what people really want to know: how the new remastering looks. In one word: brilliant. Side by side, the DVD and Blu-ray screenshots look mostly the same, with the Blu version having a much more natural and crisp color tone. But play it on a big screen, and the differences in quality become readily apparent. Whereas the DVD version loses clarity as your screen gets bigger, the Blu-ray version remains crystal clear.It really looks as if you're watching the actual animation cels themselves move, it's so clear looking. I've been amazed by plenty of older films' transfers before, but this is up there with Wizard of Oz in terms of wowing me with what a studio can do with movies from the early 20th century given a little time to revisit them.The new 7.1 audio track also sounds great. For most of the movie it isn't really too obvious, but at a few key times - mainly during the memorable songs - you can really hear the work that went into this version. And, for you old-school folk out there, the mono version is also included if you want to hear the original soundtrack to the film.In terms of extras, a few things are missing from the 2001 edition, but ultimately this is a release that will keep fans busy watching for a long time. There's hours of supplemental features in this release, and amazingly a vast majority of them are at least worth one watch. (Some, like Disney's required ""a modern Disney 'star' sings a 'hit' song addition you can skip.)There are backstage looks at how the film was made, commentary from multiple people and historians, The Backstage Disney portion and the details given about Walt and the creation of Snow White is something that all fans of Disney, movies, and history should really enjoy. The little factoids about how jokes came about, and about how Walt dug through trash to find scenes they threw away are really fun to find out.Really, I can't recommend this release enough. Not only is it a fantastic video transfer of a film that's 72 years old (which you'll forget when you see it), but it's a piece of American history. Snow White has never looked, sounded, or been presented better. With both DVD and Blu-ray included, there's no reason not to get this set. And, if you don't have a Blu-ray player, Disney is once again providing more than enough reason to look at upgrading to the high-def format."	5.0	One of the most groundbreaking films of all time gets one of the most groundbreaking Blu releases	2009-10-07	3	2	1

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A2J00K3J9KPQD3	The Dread Pirate Pastor Muppets	"Top quality animation is a painstaking process, but in the 1930s, it was a newfound discovery and an exciting adventure for Walt Disney and his team of animators. Yes, there had been other animated features and short cartoons even in color before it; but there was never a full-blown exciting mix of drama, comedy, terror, imagination, and music before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Roger Ebert has said that every animated feature since owes something to the first Disney animated feature. And he was absolutely right, for the vast majority of animated features use much of the same ""revolutionary style and invention"" as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The attention to detail in this film is a topic I could talk about for hours (what other film do you know that has a turtle painfully climbing up each stair one at a time?)The tale of Snow White has been told for generations and perhaps centuries, the most famous of which is the version by the Brothers Grimm, and it was from this version that Disney decided to make his first feature length film. The story is quite simplistic, no doubt. I won't go into it because it's hard to imagine anyone over the age of 4 who doesn't know the essentials of the story. But that's not what the attention is laid on in the film; what matters once again is the attention to detail. Another film about Snow White can be made these days that has the merely the characters, recycled dialogue from children's storybooks, and the story in its simplest form; the film would be forgotten almost instantly upon its release.I would argue that Walt Disney thought the exact same thing: you can take a fantasy and turn it into a timeless classic with the right amount of attention to detail. Take, for example, the scene just before Snow White's scary adventure in the forest: she tells a baby blue bird who has lost its parents to not be afraid. As the book ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: the Art and Creation of Walt Disney's Classic Animated Film"" tells, one early idea was for the bird to have a broken wing or to be pursued by a larger bird. But this was discarded in favor of the version seen in the film, a subtler approach to illustrate Snow White's situation.The book also shows how scenes from an animated film are made. Before this, I had a sense of how they were made, but reading the book was extraordinarily useful in figuring out the process: a layout design is prepared on pencil and paper as a set for a scene, similar to the construction of a set in live action films. After that, the backgrounds are colored over in painting (unlike a good majority of the subsequent Disney animated features, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs used watercolors instead of gouache and oil paintings as seen in its successor, Pinocchio.).When the setting is established, animators then make drawings of their respective characters. Once the action of the character is approved, the drawings are then enhanced by cleanup drawings before they are taken over to be painted and placed into the cels. And if that weren't enough, twenty-four frames have to cover one second of action. That's part of the reason why animation is so difficult. Even when a scene like Snow White instructing the animals to put the dwarves' dishes in the tube instead of stacking them lasts a few seconds, that's an amount of hard work that is often unmatched by today's computers.I have thus far been talking about the process of the animation, so I might answer the question: why does it matter? In the case of a fairy-tale like Snow White, it is often wiser to present the story in animation form, as opposed to live action. Again, I must place emphasis on attention to detail and the importance of discovery: the amount of supporting characters that surround Snow White, the Queen, and the Prince are larger than you could think; not only are the Seven Dwarfs given so much care, but also the animals, the trees, the backgrounds, and even the rain that supports the climax of the film. (Disney however, wouldn't get the movement of animals completely right until Bambi, where the attention to detail in animal movement is scary, not to mention The Lion King.)The music in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs also makes for both feel-good and frightening experiences: the songs by Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline, and Larry Morey, while somewhat simplistic, are absolutely stunning in their memorable melodies and charming lyrics (""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work"" merit the most attention). Paul Smith, on the other hand, is able to create a score that has the sense of discovery and terror at the same time.The attention given to the Dwarfs illustrate arguably the most memorable and (in Dopey's case) comedic aspects of the film. Each one is a brilliant little masterpiece, exhibiting a distinct range of personalities and facial expressions. The hero of these creations is unquestionably Grumpy, with the great animator Vladimir Tytla giving his character an arc more entertaining and more exciting than most seen in animated features today. Consider the scene where the Dwarfs leave the cottage for a day's worth of digging in the mine: Grumpy calls Snow White's kissing disgusting, and yet he cleans his forehead in a mirror and even clears his throat loudly for her attention. Before the end, she ends up kissing him on the forehead and he storms off. But he slows down, sighs with relief, and gives his first genuine smile of the whole film. He turns back to wink at the princess, who blows him a kiss and waves. Realizing she got the best of him, he tries to act tough, but ends up making a fool of himself. His arc is complete at the end of the film when he leads the Dwarfs in rescuing Snow White from the Queen.Good gracious, have I even spoken of the Queen yet? Well, let's bring it to here: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released in 1937, only two years before The Wizard of Oz. I have stated in the past that the Wicked Witch of the West may be the stereotype for witches in years to come, but look to the Wicked Queen or her terrifying alter-ego, the Old Hag, of the animated film: how many similarities can you draw between the two characters? My guess is that MGM took influence from Disney's film to create their own villain. But the Wicked Witch of the West still hasn't got a patch on a woman who demands a young girl's heart in a box.Norm Ferguson, a young animator at the time, was in charge of the design of the Old Hag, and I must thank him for it: for I was terrified of the film for many years, and his design of the monstrous woman is why. But I also must give credit to Lucille LaVerne, the voice actress of both characters: she simply changed voices by removing her false teeth. I would guess that she had the teeth in for the elegant tones of the Queen, and out for the cackling rasps of the Witch.If Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs had not been a fantasy, there wouldn't be a need for attention to detail, and the events at the end of the story wouldn't make sense. But since it is a fantasy, the Disney story men and artists totally engulfed themselves in it. Ward Kimball, one of the Nine Old Men, said in 2000 ""I still think it's the best thing we ever did."" It's ironic that he would say that, because some of his sequences were removed from the final product. (He stayed at Disney because of the offer to supervise Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio.) While I disagree with his opinion, I cannot deny that it is one of the most beautiful animated movies in history, and there is also no denying its influence. Along with Pinocchio and Fantasia, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs had a sense of discovery and a burst of imagination that has almost virtually been unequaled by anything in the realm of animation."	5.0	Breathtaking, even over 75 years later	2012-07-02	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A31ACI0E88ORDE	The Great White Father	"I wanted to do a good review now, and the only reason I knock off any stars for this is because it was Disney's first attempt at a full-length animated feature, and especially when looking at what came before and what came after, it does show in some cases.  But that is the only real criticism I can give to this masterpiece, and I won't dwell on those instances in this review: just the good parts, of which there are many.First of all, as a Christian I believe that there are certain pillars of civilization: the Church first and foremost, followed by natural hierarchy (which in our case is a patriarchal monarchy, such as we see here, if only implicitly: the Queen is Snow White's stepmother, indicating that the Queen married Snow White's father the King, by whose paternity Snow White is a princess by rights).  But after this are various fundamental art forms by which cultural traditions are passed down from one generation to another (by fundamental I mean you don't need props for any of them, just yourself and other people): rather than list those in detail, though, I will only say that all of them relate to one another by nature and so naturally combine to form a particular type of art: musical comedy.  This, of course, is a movie, and what's more it is an animated movie, but it rests entirely in the musical comedy tradition, and better still it is an old familiar story, a fairy tale--a story that naturally reflects the Gospel story.  This is the Disney formula, and it is a formula, but it's a good one because it's tried and true, and I hope Disney will return to its roots someday--even Beauty and the Beast was just over 21 years ago, so it's not like those who made good quality material have all died by now.********SPOILER ALERT********One thing I think aids in the ""plausible impossible"" of accepting fairy tale conventions where you wouldn't find them in real life is the fact that this movie is told very much in rhyme.  Even when the characters aren't singing, song is never too far away: the first conversation, between the Queen and her slave in the Magic Mirror is almost entirely in rhyme.  Likewise, Snow White speaks rather than sings the first lyrics of ""I'm Wishing"".And one thing I fear is underappreciated these days is Snow White's attitude: she's a princess by rights, and she's reduced to wearing rags and doing servant work.  But does she let it get her down?  HA!  She keeps a song in her heart and a smile on her face, and kindness to all living things.  How many of us can honestly say we would react to injustice to ourselves that way?  I can't.  But I admire her for this, as I would like to react this way.  The fact is, all life has some suffering in it, and it's beyond our control.  So what do we do when that happens?  Do we expend wasted effort trying?  Do we complain and make ourselves and other people miserable?  Or do we take the Snow White approach?Indeed, the only thing she longs for is someone to share her life with, someone to love her--she could wish that she didn't have to do servant work but could dress and act like the princess she is, but no.  And as for the love at first sight with the prince: yes, it's unrealistic, but that's the point: it's a FAIRY TALE.  As a Christian I can definitely appreciate the parallel with Jesus's love for us: we may think we don't know him, and might even initially be frightened by him when we realize He knows and sees what we're doing--but He doesn't want us to be afraid of Him, He only wants to love us, and to have us love Him back.  (Indeed, just look at the ending: the prince's palace is in the clouds, not on Earth: is this really some earthly man such as you might get a restraining order on these days?  I think not!)Another great segment is the scene where Snow White flees into the forest: what makes it great, though, is that it reflects Snow White's inner turmoil a lot better than words about how she felt could possibly convey.  Think of it this way: she just saw her stepmother's huntsman raising a knife to kill her--this is the first inkling she's gotten that someone wants her DEAD.  That someone doesn't want her, except to be DEAD.  That knowledge easily translates into the nightmarish encounters she has in the forest, which along with the music builds up and up and up until: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!  *sobbing*False alarm: it was all in her imagination.  The eyes staring at her were harmless, friendly (but shy) woodland creatures.  There was nothing to be afraid of at all.  But at this point we need to relieve our own tension, and ""With a Smile and a Song"" helps us as it helps Snow White.  By the time that song is over, and we see her singing happily with her newfound animal friends, the fear is behind us (and her) and so she can focus on more practical matters: finding a place to stay.I find it appropriate that Snow White initially thinks the cottage is the home of children, because Snow White (who by rights is a princess anyway, above the dwarfs in rank and not just in stature) takes on a motherly role in their house, not unlike Wendy with Peter Pan and the Lost Boys.  This is her opportunity to playact the role she will have for real when she gets married and has her own little ones.  Again, perfect for a fairy tale, which is about growing up out of childhood and into adulthood.Next comes something that might seem a bit tedious, but there is a point to it: with seven dwarfs, you need to keep track of them all.  So we're introduced to them by sight in their mine, and by name when Snow White sees them on the beds--and then we're given a lengthy amount of time to hear the voices and see the personalities of each individual dwarf during the time they fear a monster has invaded their home (and of course, there is some humor here to relieve the tension, especially since we the audience know there's no monster and so this is delaying the dwarfs' finding that out).  This is a good strategy because by the time Snow White puts the names to each dwarf, we are as confident as she is that the names are all correct.  (Each dwarf is lovable, too, in his own special way--yes, even Grumpy, who isn't a bad sort, he just fears things getting worse and wants not to invite trouble in their house.)So then, as I said, Snow White acts as a mother to the dwarfs, making them wash up before supper (and the washing song is one of my two favorites!).  By now, of course, since it's been so long since the threat on Snow White's life, here is the perfect opportunity to show that the Queen has discovered that Snow White is still alive.  And here, then, is the nightmarish ""Jekyll and Hyde"" scene of the Queen becoming the Witch, so that her inner ugliness reaches the surface.  Starting at this point, the movie uses the common convention (introduced by D. W. Griffith) of going back and forth, with each scene becoming progressively shorter, to build up tension to a climax.First, one last scene of revelry with Snow White and the Dwarfs, the Yodel Song (another of my favorites), and then Snow White singing ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"", which serves as a good lullaby.  And then of course the dwarfs, being gentlemen, let Snow White sleep in their beds while they stay downstairs: one last repose together.  But then the Witch produces a poisoned apple to inflict a sleeping death upon Snow White, which can only be broken by love's first kiss.  A more obvious allegory to the Gospel I cannot think of: forbidden fruit, and the sleeping death signifying actual death, with love's first kiss signifying Jesus resurrecting us on the last day.Anyway, Snow White begins to charm even Grumpy, desiring it that he come to like her, and so trying to be as nice as possible, even making a gooseberry pie with his name on it: try not to cry as you see the name being spelled out in dough.  But of course, Snow White does make one mistake, as did Eve: but it's out of kindness to an elderly stranger, can we really blame her?  Anyway, that in and of itself wasn't the danger, it was eating the apple--believing that it was a ""magic wishing apple"".  That too adds to its allegory as a temptation of the Devil's, as the serpent promised Eve that the forbidden fruit would grant her godlike knowledge.Of course it is Grumpy who first says that they must save Snow White--but of course they're too late.  And while they do drive the Witch out of their house, it is telling that they do not defeat her.  She does run away (evil cannot overcome good) but it is lightning striking the cliff on which she is trapped that causes her to fall to her death--made clear in no uncertain terms by the vultures that swirl down....  Again, the common Disney trope of villains falling to their death recall Satan falling out of Heaven and into hell.There have been a lot of ""Disney deaths"" where the good guy seems dead, or else is under a spell as Snow White is here, but revives in the end.  We've come to expect it.  But this was the first time, and it is appropriately tragic: the rain actually fogs things up, and the music sounds like a funeral dirge, and the dimly lit candles add to this.  Just try not to cry, especially when Grumpy cries.  The only way this could be sadder is if Grumpy looked at the gooseberry pie with his name on it.  Perhaps the saddest moment in all of Disney (yes, including Bambi's mother).At this point, they had text explaining that the dwarfs put Snow White in a glass coffin, and the changing of the seasons are clearly indicated by the trees in the background--they didn't do this since the beginning with the book, and they usually don't do it in later Disney movies, but what else could they have done without being anti-climactic or stepping on the mood of the previous scene?  But of course, here comes the prince to save the day: he kisses Snow White awake, and our sadness turns to joy.  Yes, now the dwarfs must say goodbye to Snow White, as she is leaving them: but at least now it is a proper goodbye, as she is leaving of her own free will to follow her dream.  And there is a reprise of ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" at the end as we see the palace in the clouds.  A perfect happily ever after ending to a nearly perfect movie.********END SPOILER ALERT********I can definitely see why this won a special Academy Award.  This was Walt Disney's favorite story, and it really shows here, that this was a labor of love.  Yes, it is a little rough in some places but that can be excused because they had never actually done a full-length animated feature before.  What they did right was SO right (and so much of an advance in so few years!) that I don't feel right complaining about it.  Indeed, it pains me to knock off a star at all, but I do have to be honest.  In short, I very much agree with the sentiment that this is ""the one that started it all, and still the fairest of them all""."	4.0	Still the fairest of them all!	2013-05-18	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	The Groove	"Before ""The Wizard of Oz,"" 1937's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was THE definitive children's motion picture.  Walt Disney's debut feature works splendidly on so many levels: as an animated film, as a compelling story, and as a musical.  True, some parts are very dated, and the movie does indeed drag in some places, but you'll have to suspend criticism and acknowledge ""Snow White""'s technical achievements.  The idea of doing a full-length cartoon was apparently unheard of in 1937, and few believed that this picture would be a hit.  Not only have the box office receipts proved the naysayers wrong, but it's been re-released over the years to generation after generation.  The DVD picture is as good as it gets, with no print flaws or grain.  The surround sound mix, however, is a bit flawed and sounds slightly artificial.  I don't think Walt intended to do this film for a high-tech home theater network.  Regardless, if you have to own ONE animated DVD, ""Snow White"" is a must-have.  It's a beautifully done feature and is an undisputed classic."	5.0	"""Someday My Prince Will Come"""	2002-01-07	0	0	0

I was a little dissapointed at first because it started out as one of those ""old"" cartoons that you cannot get kids interested in these days. However, as the movie played, my children, especially the youngest 3 (ages 2, 3 and 8) actually sat down and watched the movie in its entirety. In the words of my 2yr old ""The turtle is funny."" They absolutely loved it. They even watched the extras at the end. We didn't have a chance to play with any of the other features yet but I bet they are just as awesome.As a parent, I loved that it came with both dvd and blue ray. I gave the kids the dvd to take upstairs. Now they can watch it any time they want. It has quickly become a bedtime favorite. The price is well worth it especially when I can get the kids tucked in and calmed down by 9:00 pm. They are excited to get into their beds so we can turn on Snow White.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A14NA0W8ESGDSI	Timothy Lovett	There is little I can really say about this movie besides the differences between it and the older classic we all know and love.1. The movie has the option of showing paintings on the sides of the film to expand it to widescreen size. I used these and while they looked kind of cool didn't really feel like the biggest improvement to me.2. The sound and picture quality is good but it's a really old film so you can't really push the level of detail up too much. It performs well given the medium, however.In general, you likely can makedo with just the DVD. The fact this combo comes with both a DVD and a Bluray disk obviously is hinting that while bluray is likely the wave of the future not much has changed given it can't really.I'd suggest buying this if you have a bluray player otherwise just considering buying the DVD alone if you can find it.	5.0	A Classic Strikes Again	2009-11-19	0	0	0

However, that being said, I do feel like I was stiffed in the fact that the Platinum edition had FAR more bonus features. Gone is the Silly Symphony ""Goddess of Spring"" and all the radio broadcasts, and basically anything that was on the bonus disc of the Platunum version. Notice also that Barbara Streisand's version of 'Some Day My Prince Will Come' has been replaced with the generic teen Disney star of the moment. Typical.I also feel that the prior release was better in the fact that the movie was made to fit the screen (Original Theatrical Aspect ratio) rather than the (1.33:1) ratio that it is now. I think this is done simply for the pointless DisneyView art of Tony Bluth.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A6H5ITFLZHOY0	"Troy L. Anderson ""www.andersonvision.com"""	"As Disney's first feature length film Snow White stands out as a timeless classic. The story is about how jealousy and vanity can consume and destroy a person to the point where they would kill those who stand in their way. The moral however is about how outer beauty cannot hide inner ugliness and that the most beautiful person is one who is beauty on the inside as well as outside. Here you go world, Disney's first princess movie.As I suggested earlier this movie is about beauty and jealousy. Snow White is a princess and she has a hatred-filled stepmother. Her stepmother has run out of tolerance for Snow White because she has surpassed her as the fairest of them all and must be killed. The huntsman she hires to do the job can't bring himself to do it and tells Snow White to run away, which she does. She runs away and finds the house that belongs to the Seven Dwarfs, Sleepy, Sneezy, Happy, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, and Dopey. Snow White, along with her furry animal friends, cleans their tiny house in the hopes that they will let her stay, which of course they do. Now seven men living in one house and who work in a mine don't have much time to cook and clean, what else can you expect from seven bachelors? So, Snow White doing all the house work helps out immensely. So Snow White hides out there for a while. The Queen in the meantime finds out that Snow White is still alive and plans to kill her herself, but first she has to disguise herself and make a poison apple that contains the Sleeping Death poison. The Queen disguised shows up at the cottage (yet another example of why you shouldn't take anything from strangers) and Snow White takes a bite of the apple and isn't really dead, but looks dead. The only way to get her to wake is love's first kiss. She already has a love so all that was needed was for Prince Charming to find her. He finds her and kisses her and she miraculously wakes up.....and they all lived happily ever after.This was the original ""happily ever after"" story. This movie set the bar for all fairytales and princess movies to come. This should be the first Disney movie any child watches because it is the first. Now while this movie doesn't cut it much for me anymore it was greatest thing on earth when I was five. I still love the dwarfs especially Grumpy and Dopey. I liked Grumpy because I could relate to him and I love Dopey because he's goofy and made me laugh. I love the early animation style they used. There's just something about it, maybe it's just comforting because I grew up with it. I like how there's a main point and there's no deviation, it's very to the point, but I find that's actually very little to the story itself; it's just very short. In the end all you can say is that it is the epitome of the Disney classic fairytale.The Blu-Ray comes couple with a DVD version of the film in this Diamond Edition release. The audio is a crystal clear 7.1 surround channel mix that almost feels like you're hearing the picture as it was during the recording phase. There's also Disney View that integrates with BD Live to provide a full-impact look at Disney's first animated feature. You get music videos, featurettes and dedicated looks back at what went into making the film. Plus, you get a sneak peek at The Princess and the Frog.What matters most of all is the picture quality. This transfer looks like someone opened the Disney vaults and gave you a copy of the original print. There is no digital noise, artifacts, compression issues or dirt on the print. Hell, I can't think of a recent release that offers you a film that perfect. The DVD copy included with the film packs most of the EPK and Disney Channel friendly content that's to be expected. What's going to keep this Blu-Ray disc spinning in your home theater is the Wow factor. That first Wow you get from the opening credits through the final frame of the film.

If I were rating the movie alone, it would be 5 stars.My daughter enjoyed watching it a couple of times (she is 3), however now she wants to turn it off when the Queen is changing herself into the old woman - she says it scares her (surprisingly the forest scene does not seem to bother her).  So we'll probably put this one away for a while.  Just wanted to throw that out there for those of you with younger kids.My main issue with this is the whole ""Diamond Edition"" thing.  We don't have a Blu-Ray player, but my daughter was really wanting this movie, so I (stupidly) broke down and bought the DVD/Blu-Ray edition.  All of the ""bonus features"" are on Blu-Ray - it is 1 DVD disc and 2 Blu-Ray discs.  What is up with Disney not releasing the DVD version at the same time?  Trying to push Blu-Ray technology?  In any case, it was disappointing.Frankly, I am disgusted with the way Disney markets their stuff.  It is almost unavoidable if you have a young child - and I am partially to blame because I wanted to share these movies from my childhood with my daughter, so I fell for it hook, line and sinker - for them to be inundated by Disney stuff.  Especially Princesses.  One problem we have run into is this ""Vault"" business - my daughter sees these princesses and knows that there is a movie that goes along with them, yet some of them are still in the vault, and won't be available for a few years.  It's a stupid idea, and I find many of Disney's business practices unconscionable, but then again, I blame myself for allowing my child to be exposed to any of it at such a young age."	4.0	"""Diamond Edition"""	2009-11-11	1	0	1

Using the Brothers Grimm tale about the princess with the skin as fair as snow who is taken in by a group of seven dwarfs, Walt Disney fleshed out the characterization of most of the main players while also watering down some of the more graphic and disturbing elements of the story. The movie had been in production for years and Disney gambled his entire future on the project. However, the development took so long and the picture cost so much money that before its release it was known around Hollywood as ""Disney's Folly"". But, Disney put the critics to rest and the film would become not only one of the most beloved animated films, but one of the most popular films of all time. The success of the picture paved the way for Disney to expand his company from a small in-house production company that created mostly shorts to a major Hollywood studio.The plot of the movie is rather straight-forward. Princess Snow White's stepmother is a wicked and evil queen and the most beautiful woman in her kingdom. She knows because she asks her Magic Mirror every day. Then one day the Mirror reveals that her stepdaughter, Snow White is more beautiful than she. The Queen is furious and orders a woodsman to take the girl into the woods to kill her. He takes her into the woods, but cannot deliver the blow and tells Snow White to run. Snow White runs away and stumbles upon the cottage of seven dwarfs. She becomes a kind of adopted mother for the little men and they shower their affection upon her. However, the Queen learns what has happened and sets out to put Snow White into a deathly sleep that only can be broken by true love's first kiss.Even though the movie is over 70 years-old, it's still gorgeous. Audiences nowadays have become accustomed to the slick, chic, and sleek animation of CGI. Those style of films are enjoyable to watch, but there is an eloquence and a personality of the old hand-style of animation that is lost when a film is done through CGI. Since it was the first of its kind, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is one of the best examples of classic animation to watch. For example, watch the scene where Snow White is getting water from a well and the camera shows us what it looks like from viewing up the well, through the water, ripples and all. It's a difficult scene that looks gorgeous and it was all drawn by hand. Simply magnificent.The Diamond Edition of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is basically the Blu-Ray edition of the movie with a DVD thrown in to try to lure people who don't really want Blu-Ray into getting Blu-Ray. The DVD only features an audio commentary, a music video with Tiffany Thornton, a sneak peak at the upcoming THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, and a series of trailers for Disney DVDs. Meanwhile the Blu-Ray discs are loaded with all kinds of features, but since I'm still not going to jump on the Blu-Ray wagon, I can't watch any of those.Overall, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is a must own movie for any Disney fan, film student, or person who enjoys animated movies. If you don't already own the movie on DVD, the Diamond Edition of the movie is worth getting because Disney will be putting the movie back into the vault and it won't be available again for years."	5.0	Treasuring the Classic	2009-11-12	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3O9LMY2DTV2B2	T. W. Fuller	The story of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; is an enchanting, experimental romp with animation.  At the time of its release, in December of 1937, Walt Disney was taking a heavy, financial risk with this movie.  Film goers were used to watching short animated films, like &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, starring Disney creation, Mickey Mouse.  However, what was yet to be known was ... would audiences sit through an hour and a half cartoon?The story itself is simple enough.  A wicked queen, vane in every respect, has but one sinister ambition.  That being to be &quot;the most beautiful of all&quot;.  Every day she asks her mirror, &quot;Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the most fairest of them all?&quot;.  One day, however, the mirror answers, &quot;Snow White&quot; as the most fairest.  Outraged that there is another person more beautiful than her, she orders a huntsman to find Snow White, and kill her.  He obeys this command up until a point.  After taking her deep into the forest, he has seconds thoughts, tells Snow White what the queen wanted him to do, and pleads with her to escape, which she does.Snow White meets up with seven dwarfs, who initially have no interest in her, nor her imposing ways.  The dwarfs are bachelors, of sorts; at least, living in the manner of a bachelor.  They are dirty and unkemp, as is their home.  Snow White gets them to clean up and live more respectfully; a rough task in the beginning, and much despised by the dwarfs.  However, she grown on them, and soon they come to respect her.Meanwhile, the queen discovers Snow White is still alive.  Finding out where she is, the queen disguises herself as an old hag, and goes in search of her.  In her possession she carries an apple ... a poisonous apple with which she intends to give to Snow White to eat.  While the dwarfs are out working, Snow White encounters the queen, and is given the apple.  After taking one bite, she falls to the ground, dead, unable to be revived and brought back to life but by &quot;love's first kiss&quot;.  Eventually a prince comes along, as is the custom in fairy tales, and kisses Snow White, bringing her back to life.  What happens to the queen is an entirely different matter indeed.So is a short synopsis of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;.  However, problems evolved in the making of &quot;Snow White&quot;.  Based on a Grimms Bros. fairy tale, there was not enough material to make it into a film version, and Dinsey wondered how he could make an animated feature length film, and still keep the audiences attention.  He also wondered what he could do to offset the horror in the film.  &quot;Snow White&quot;, after-all, dealt with, and ultimately contained, much terror that even today still frightens some younger viewers.The answer came in several factors.  One was in fast paced crosscutting scenes, so that the action was not concentrated on one particular character for too long.  Another answer came with using sweet, mellow songs to help move the story along.  &quot;I'm Wishing&quot;, &quot;With A Smile In My Song&quot;, &quot;Whistle While You Work&quot;, and &quot;Heigh Ho&quot; were just some of the songs that helped carry &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;.  A third factor, and perhaps the most important of them all, came in the comedics of the dwarfs themselves.  Doc, Sleepy, Grumpy, Happy, Sneezy, Bashful, and Dopey were all meticulously created, each with their own identities; and but for them and their silliness throughout &quot;Snow White&quot;, the film may not have moved with the speed it did, and older members in the audience may have become bored, while younger ones may have become more frightened.All of the elements were now in place, including a wonderful castthat starred Adriana Casoletti as Snow White, Harry Stockwell, as the prince, and Lucille Laverne as the Queen.  In its initial release, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; pulled in over four million dollars, thereby securing both Disney's future, and the future of animated films.  Without the success of Snow White, it is easy to conclude Disney would not have attempted it again, and we never would have known of &quot;Bambi&quot; &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, or &quot;Dumbo&quot;.  Thanks to Walt Disney's heavy gamble with &quot;Snow White&quot;, his exhausting persistence in seeing it through, a flood gate of highly successful animated films have graced the silver screen, amusing and entertaining audiences for decades hence.	5.0	Oh, For More Movies Like Snow White	2001-11-17	13	10	3
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AYQF4Z1EQDACU	Tyler Reece	"It was almost 10 years after Walt Disney and the mouse he created became worldwide household names, that he gave Hollywood the first ever full length animated feature ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". One of the greatest American films of all time, one of most renowed and the animated film to have the most releases from 1937-1993. An important masterpiece that is was once called ""Walt Disney's Folly"" but, who said that was very wrong, the film was immediate phemonenon and the highest grossing film of all time till it was knocked by ""Gone with the Wind"" I've been a fan of Disney for a long time and I know of all the animated films this is the one to see first. Snow White was only the begining, cartoons still stayed with Disney, but Snow White was Walt's turn to the movies. If you love Disney  as much as I do then see the most celebrated animated film of all time, the merriest and scariest of them all. See the one that started it all and still the fairest one of all.

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A7GSGC0G8R6PW	Tyler Tanner	WOW! I got this for my AFI 100 Best Films collection and this by far is one of my favorites. Kids will love this for the same reasons we and previous generations did. And adults and film buffs will love it for the sheer volume of extras that this DVD comes with. It's almost as if the movie is secondary! There is so much here it even comes with a guided tour which I highly recommend taking. Before you do that though, leave the disc on the main menu screen for awhile. The Magic Mirror will let you know what he thinks about you taking your time!This is also a great way to introduce your kids to Walt Disney as he is clearly throughout the entire DVD. Hopefully they will be as entranced as we were. The &quot;Disney Through the Ages&quot; is my favorite featurette. It takes you decade by decade from the year Snow White was released until the year 2000. You have the option to play each separately or all together. This even has deleted scenes and songs from over 60 years ago!Kudos to the Mouse for the time and effort on a format for much a beloved film! Get this while it lasts.	5.0	Great for kid and adults	2003-01-16	0	0	0
0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	AY6A8KPYCE6B0	Tyson	"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a classic for so many reasons.  Other than being the first feature-length animation ever, it's also one of the most humorous, charming, memorable movies ever made.But of course, you've already seen the movie (probably a 100 or more times) and really you want to know if this Blu Ray transfer is worth replacing your other copy.  The simple answer:  YES.The standards set by this Diamond release has really got me excited about future releases from the series, because I assure you it is jam packed with goodies, and even more importantly, the digital restoration is absolutely stunning.  For a 73 year old movie, it looks so good it might has well been made last year.  It's presented in its original ratio of 1:33:1 which is essentially a square. While if you have a wide screen TV there will be those kind of unpleasant looking black bars on the side.  No fear, however, as Disney has ever so creatively found a way to make even those look beautiful.  If you select to watch the ""DisneyView"" experience, they insert beautiful artwork in the sections where the black bars would be.  The art is usually a red velvet curtain, or marble  lining, or something to give the picture a look of stunning presentation.  The color palette of the artwork always matches the scene of the movie so you almost don't even realize it's not part of the film.  An amazing feature!Other special goodies included are deleted scenes, which are quite cute, information on ""Snow White Returns"" which was a recently discovered storyline for a animation short where Snow White comes to visit the dwarfs and they decide to make her a bed as a present.  There's also some segments on the theatrical debut of Snow White which is of course very exciting.  Walt was such a showman! I had no idea that he presented the film in a DisneyLand like setting.Even as animation takes a drastic 3D turnaround, early Disney 2D movies will be forever remembered and no collection of them would be complete without the gracious (and a little air heady) Snow White, her animal entourage, and her seven short friends.  With this new Blu Ray release you can be sure that you are getting the absolute best copy of the film to date, and it will make the movie only that much more magical for you."	5.0	73 Never Looked So Good!	2010-01-24	0	0	0

I always thought the term ""Imagineers"" (what Walt Disney called them) was perfect, as that is what these wonderful people who think up the stories and the artists who bring them to life, certainly are.  It is a wonderful gift -- imagination -- and if used to lift thought to a brighter and more innocent sense of life, and to give joy, then that's a real accomplishment!  Snow White being one of the very early ones, if not the first one (don't remember) is certainly one of my favourites, and I am slowly collecting them as they become available.  You can be sure my Grandchildren are enjoying them, for which I am grateful considering the type of ""entertainment"" being produced for children today!!Virginia Houston"	5.0	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs	2010-02-01	0	0	0

It is so unbelievably sincere (and honestly, sincerely sincere) that it probably has more effect on depraved cynics like myself than on normal folk. When the dwarfs started singing ""Heigh-Ho"", I broke into tears. (And you don't want to know how I feel about ""One Song"". I was in love with someone I felt that way about.) It's no coincidence ""Snow White"" is the film the mogwai watch when they invade the theater. As Billy Peltzer says... ""They're watching 'Snow White' -- and they love it!"" Who wouldn't?My only complaint is that the sequence of Snow White meeting the dwarfs, making them wash their hands, etc, (note the similarity to ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"") runs on too long. But this was all very novel 70 years ago. Grim Natwick's animation of Snow White, especially her dance with the dwarfs, is still a marvel. (He animated Betty Boop, and Disney hired him specifically for Snow White.)Disney and his artists had no idea what they were doing... But they managed to ""nail it"" on the first try. There have been more-sophisticated animated films, but there has never been a ""better"" one. And when you get the audience to break into tears over the ""death"" of an animated character -- how much farther can you go?Now... as to the Blu-ray transfer (which I viewed on a 60"" Pro Kuro fed from a Sony BDP-S550)... This is ""Snow White""'s second ""digital restoration"". It is not the same as the digital restoration for the Platinum DVD. For one thing, every last bit of dust -- especially in the Multiplane shots -- has been expunged.The overall ""look"" strongly resembles the recent ""Pinocchio"" restoration that caused some controversy. (You might want to look at the ""Pinocchio"" reviews to get an idea of it.) ""Pinocchio"" had three promblems:1. The overall reduction in contrast caused many of the darker scenes to be too light. Given that ""Pinocchio"" is a dark film (both visually and thematically), this significantly altered the film's ""visual tone"".2. Cel imperfections -- uneven painting, in particular -- were agressively removed, to the point where the film sometimes looked downright ""sterile"".3. The saturation was goosed to the point where it seemed unnatural for a film that was supposed to emulate ""European masters"".""Snow White"" appears to have been processed in a similar fashion. It's not a persistently ""dark"" film, so the (perhaps unwanted) increase in shadow detail is not as bothersome. Similarly, the ""cleaning up"" seems less aggressive, and there's rarely any sense of visual sterility.As for saturation... I was pleased to see that it was restrained, and not in your face. But... when viewing the supplemental materials on disk 2, the inserts from this transfer showed noticeably higher saturation. Which is thoroughly confusing, because both are presumably derived from the same digital source. Regardless, you can adjust saturation on your monitor to your taste.There is also the issue of color rendition. As wonderful as Technicolor was, it did not render all hues perfectly. So tests were made and paints adjusted to bring the final color closer to what the artists had in mind. Unfortunately, when you make a direct transfer from the original three-strip B&W; negative, you lose Technicolor's errors, and the colors are rendered more closely to the way they appeared on the background or cel. This was not generally noticeable in ""Pinocchio"", but it is (or appears to be) in ""Snow White"". Some lighter colors -- particularly on animals, and some clothing -- just don't look right. Two of the birds have vivid lemon-yellow splotches on their chests, which I don't remember from any preceding version, and almost certainly could not have been Disney's intention.There are also some surprising glitches. In the title credits, there are green splotches over some of the text. Worse, in the sequence where Dopey gets caught in the furniture and kitchenware and runs out of the cottage, there is moment of the dwarfs in and among the trees with a nasty green color shift, that disappears when Dopey enters the frame. It's hard to understand how this was not caught.The soundtrack is supposed to be 7.1, but tracks 6 and 7 remained silent, and there wasn't much on 4 and 5. In compensation, the sound itself is just plain beautiful -- very clean and rich. (Contrast it with the new ""Wizard of Oz"", which has the worst sound I've yet heard from any edition of this film.)So... should you trade in the Platinum DVD for the Blu-ray? If you have no intention of ever switching to Blu-ray, I'd say ""no"". The earlier edition is excellent, and the changes wrought by this new transfer probably won't be important. But, if nothing else, the 1080p transfer is intended to be seen on a large, high-resolution display. You're not going to get that quality from an up-converted DVD.The high resolution has the expected benefits (note the incredible detail on the pages of the storybook at the beginning) as well as an unexpected drawback -- the poor animation of Prince C. is all-too visible, especially his mouth when singing.We'll have to get used to seeing the classic Disney films in ways that represent both improvements, and changes from the artists' original intent. I guess that's the way it is.PS: Since writing this, I've viewed the DVD version on a 36"" 400-series Sony WEGA IDTV. Much of the quality is retained, though the picture is (not surprisingly) not so spectacular as it is on Blu-ray. However, the change in the picture's ""visual tone"" actually seems to help on a smaller, lower-definition display. The ""errors"" (which I've forwarded to Disney) were on the DVD as well."	5.0	But what about the sound and image quality?	2009-10-07	7	6	1

It came just in time, as I had only recently finally purchased both a big screen HDTV as well as a Blue Ray player to accompany it.Growing up, Snow White was one of my all time Disney favorites.  I hadn't seen or heard of it for quite a while, as Disney had locked it up in it's vault for years, I suppose awaiting a future opportunity to rerelease it in some yet unknown magnificent form.

You should have seen the expression of joy when she opened this gift on Christmas.  She's watched the movie several times already and has played with some of the special features.  If you have a ""little princess"" this is a MUST ADD for her collection."	5.0	Great gift for your little princess....	2009-12-27	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A56NOY9M5ROVU	Zenbob	I purchased this both for my young kids and for my wife, who had never seen the whole movie.  Well, that was a win from the get-go, but the real icing is how well the DVD is stocked with extra features.  Disney did an excellent job transferring this classic to the DVD format, but they didn't stop there; filled with witty and charming bonus features, just having this film on DVD is an experience in itself.  This is a DVD that could make believers of those who have considered moving from videotape to digital video but needed something to convince them.  If only you could edit Michael Eisner out of the small introduction to Barbra Streisand's version of &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot; it would be perfect.	5.0	A timeless classic for a reason	2002-01-04	0	0	0

0788828126	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - Platinum Edition	A3V7V3TTWTNXAM	Zoelly	As a mother's perspective I must say that my children were very entertained as they saw this movie. Not only once but they played it 3 times the day that it arrived. The musicals were very entertaining. The quality of the movie was really nice and crisp. Only downside for me is that I don't like my children to see witchcraft even if it is a fairy tale(when the queen is making the potion and puts it in the apple). Just my thoughts...	4.0	Perfect for a family with small children	2009-10-26	1	1	0
