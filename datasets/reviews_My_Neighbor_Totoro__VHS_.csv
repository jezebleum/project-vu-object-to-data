6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AT1IO0M00QU95	A. Atwood	"My Neighbor Totoro is a favorite in my family, and my daughter wanted her own copy for her birthday. I had no idea that Disney had redubbed the original English version with new actors - why? The original version was so charming - it DIDN'T NEED ""IMPROVING"" with famous actors! This new version is stupid and unwatchable. I feel seriously misled and tricked into purchasing the wrong version of a favorite movie. Thanks for nothing!"	1.0	Wrong version!!!!

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A38Y2TS5E5TL21	"A. Benson ""book nerd"""	My family loves My Neighbor Totoro. There are some cultural differences in it--it can come off as a little strange to people in the US. But I like that about it. I've heard it said that Totoro is as popular a character in Japan as Winnie the Pooh is here. If you've seen and liked other Studio Ghibli movies, you've got to see this one.	5.0	My Neighbor Totoro	2012-12-16	0	0	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	ARSR4TV170715	Abigail Rosenberg	My Neighbor Totoro is great fun for adults and children alike. It also gives one a glimpse of 1940's era Japan, replete with scenic rice paddies, fashion, culture and tradition. Satsuki packs an oishii (delicious) lunch box for her family as she helps her father, a professor at a local University cope with the illness and absence of his wife.Meanwhile a mystical Neko-bas (cat buss) gives the eldest daughter and her little sister (Mei) a ride to see their mother in the hospital. This tale is filled with delightful Totoros ranging from the smallest (kototoro) to the largest (ototoro) who greets the children with a mighty roar, however let's them fall asleep on his belly...Simply charming. The film maker, Hayao Miyazaki, contributes a valuable new addition to the world of animation comparable, yet distinct from Disney's finest classics. Jyodeki (very good).	5.0	Simply Charming	2005-02-03	10	9	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A389ENB676SW5M	A Customer	This animation is about two young girls who meet up some &quot;spirits&quot; from the local forest. It deals with the beliefs (and realities?) of children, especially with a loving father who is happy to  share their young outlook on life.I have shown this movie to a group of  13 adults  (including one &quot;critic&quot; who likes to analyze every  film that comes along) who end up with tears in their eyes and who came up  to me later and told me what a great film they thought it was.The  characters were very &quot;real&quot; to me. The nanny is old and ugly, but  has an incredibly kind heart. The children act like the real children I've  known - mostly responsible, but sometimes messing up. It was so easy to  forget this was a &quot;cartoon&quot; and to identify with these  people!I love the style of animation. It reminded me of  some of the  early Disney animations. When people laugh their mouths are too big, or  steps are too long, or those things that exagerate and communicate  something that &quot;realistic detail&quot; can't do.It is a full length  feature film with plot,  character development and it runs you up and down  the emotional tone scale (from very sad to very happy) several times.	5.0	Great, spiritually uplifting movie!	1999-04-05	5	5	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1ZURNVW6CQGPL	Adam C. Rhea	"The beautiful thing about Hiyao Miyazaki is how sort of ""foreign"" his story elements feel, but how readily identifiable his human characters are.  The two sisters in this movie are cute to watch and interact believably with their world, not in an exaggerated manner like in many kids movies.  The movie moves at a relaxing quiet pace too, not racing along and full of explosions, again, like many kids movies."	5.0	This is a beautiful quiet fun kids movie adults will like too	2007-09-21	0	0	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2PRL1JJ3O19E3	Adam Herbst	Don't tell anyone, but there is animist Japanese religion all over this perfect animated movie.  Does that make it animated animism or animist animation?  I don't know and does it matter - NO!  This movie is sweet and beautiful with a marvelous soundtrack.  It is gentle without putting you to sleep.  How come the only good Disney movies come from other studios these days?  Because there were never any good Disney movies.  (Oops, tipped my cards).  Bottom line:  buy this for your kids and it won't be long before Porco Rosso makes a crash landing at your sty.	5.0	Shinto for the Kindergarten Set	2008-07-31	3	3	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A18BD98SU49UB7	"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H."""	"My neighbor Totoro is not only one of the finest animated films I have ever seen, it is one of the best movies period. It has enough heart to spead across a hundred film's, and still have some to spare. I hate to call it ""too cute for words"" but it is. Hayao Miyazaki, the director, (also doing this years Spirited Away, released in America by Disney) has really outdone himself. My neighbor Totoro has many terrific qualities, such as the emaculate detail. There are dozens of instances in which object such as tadpoles in puddles, a bottle at the bottom of a stream, butterflies swirling around, acorns spilling out of little Mel's pocket, and her hat falling off when she runs...the list could go on. (Also watch how the children walk, run, and play around, its awesomely realistic.)The way the story is handled is so unique. An example of this happens when the children claim that they have seen Totoro, the large, furry protector of the woods. When their father hears this, he nods and says, ""You were lucky to see him. Maybe one day we will all see him.""  Rather than the expected ""Your crazy"" attitude we are so use to seeing. Also when the children suspect that the house may be haunted, the dad chimes in ""That would be great, every since I was little I wanted to live in a haunted house!""Any movie that has such family love is very special. These sisters, Mel, and Satzuki, genuinly love one another, and the father loves them back. There is a scene in which the youngest sister Mel, goes to Satzuki's school just to be with her. When Satzuki attempts to tell her that she belongs back at home, Mel latches hold in a tight hug and won't let go. This type of affection is rampant in this movie, and its great to see.My neighbor Totoro has won many deserving awards in the children and family realm (with other awards as well), and though it was made for younger audiences, it is something that adults willalso appreciate.  ~s.a.o.s.~"	5.0	Mel and Satzuki	2002-09-27	4	3	1

I anticipated and assumned (possiblyand likely wrongly) that they would adhere to and evenmake strongly better in quality these standards,but for which in the past 15 years I have been sadlydissappointed and upsetted by actually, when the exactopposite started to become to be being allowed to occur.But getting back to sharing with youWHAT I KNOW ABOUT ""My Neighbor Totoros""!,I will never get enough of this film.I have been privileged to view & LISTEN to it,both... in itsoriginal versionwith English-word translation Subscripted,and also luckily in the superbly doneproper-British/English dubbed-in Voices version,which to my surprise, brought the quality of the movieappropriately upward towards a full perfection,so that it could thenCOMPLEMENT !JUSTLY! the animationthat was already so beautifully well donein itsintricate, warmly-specialized detail;(possibly enlightenedthrough my wondering mind)...I was surprised to find that THE FIRST FILM,the version using the language of originDID NOT PUT even half AS MUCH EFFORT/TIME/or ENTHUSIASMINTO THEIR VOCAL ENHANSMENTS, as what the later version did,and for which it truly deserved that attention as itdespite correct original language lacked greatly in feelingand authenticity of ages or emotions required.I expect that that will not happen again though after peoplecome to realize the quality offered in his animations.This is a decent film with deep substance that any personcan feel good about taking the time to en-corporate and allow itto become an integral part of themselves in their own lives and furthermoreto even share with othersand be delighted as well to watch over and over with close friends and familyduring the years to come.It shares realities of the world's good qualities and horrors,and also how the spirits within us and the world around us do help healand grow together in harmony.It was a great justice, to the film, to re-due it with the voice-overs made intoits animated-English-Voice version.Grateful to those who had the ability andtook the time/money/and trouble to the tweaking ofsuch an irresistible masterpiece...I will be happy and proud to share with any child or adult,now and in the future, this film...and I am myself looking forward as well, to seeing itover and over again;*giggles*~ with a sense of fondnessand pride, for the film, while doing so*."	5.0	wonderfully spirit rooted animation puts one in awe.	2006-02-16	12	1	11

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	ASSFMO78A64R9	Ahisha Liggett	This movie is one of the greatest movies of my childhood. I loved this movie dearly. I lost my tape several years ago, and recently rented the DVD version that Disney took over. I was so excited! But after watching several mins I noticed that this was not the same. Disney did voice-overs for the characters and the movie to me was horrible like that! So I stopped it and refused to watch anymore! I know that sounds over the top but when you have something incredible like this, you don't change it! So yes I then wanted to get the original DVD but that was so expensive!

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2A9ODK3G1HBKB	"Alayne Peterson ""katydidmama"""	"We began renting Miyzaki films from Netflix after we saw Spirited Away in 2006. My Neighbor Totoro is the film that makes me wish I was a small child again. We watched it with our 3 1/2 year old daughter, who burst into tears when it ended because she wanted to see it again immediately! Two weeks later, she walks around the house singing ""To-to-ro To-toro!"" Bringing the works of Miyazaki (and other Studio Ghibli films) to an American audience is the best thing Disney has done in the last 10 years, bar none (yes, that includes the deal with Pixar, whose films, while charming in their own way, are often too slick by half for me).My Neighbor Totoro appeals to the kid in all of us, and takes us back to a time before deadlines and the pressures of the world came calling."	5.0	Best Miyazaki film for small children (+ adults too)!	2008-03-13	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1MSY51J95SUGO	"Alec Spangler ""Tsu4444"""	I loved the Fox version of this film; it was absolutely amazing. I always watched it as a kid, and I still do. When I bought the Disney version, I didn't know there was a difference. As I watched it, I noticed something was wrong; the voice actors were completely different. Disney completely ruined the movie by doing this. The sisters sound exactly the same (the idiots chose twins to revoice-over the movie) and the father sounds plain. In fact, most of the voices sound as though they threw together a bunch of random people with no experience, handed them scripts, and told them to voice their parts without any practice. The Disney version was very poorly done; I highly recommend the Fox version of this movie for the full experience.	1.0	Original version is amazing, but Disney is crap.	2010-03-17	14	8	6
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A143YXWNDFZYCY	"Alexander Kogan ""lover of the arts"""	ok let me get this outta the way I love this film, but the thing that worries me is who is publishing it. A few years back Fox released Totoro on DVD with a crappy transfer, I mean it looks like they just scanned it into the machine and let it go without even doing mandatory touch-ups to it... perhaps that could be a good thing in retrospect compared to who has the rights now. A poor transfer does not blemish a masterpiece, even though the colors are bland and sometimes off, the heart is not lost. Anywho let me get to my point. Disney currently holds the right to release special edition and while many people have been anticipating the release, you do realize this is the company who in the 80's rejected publishing back to the future because of the kiss between marty and loriene (if you don't know what i'm talking go watch back to the future). This is the company who cut out a smoking texan in the Olypus movie segment from it's own fantasia DVD! Don't even get me started on the Disney Radio stuff, I remember I rented some disney video (I think it was either Little mermaid II or fun and fancy free. ((make fun of me and i'll sick a legion of girl scouts on you and by the time there through with you you'll be out about a dozen or so thousand dollars and be stuck with a life-time supply of moderatly over-priced cookies.))) and I was skimming over the extras when I saw this Mambo no.5 remake that made me wince very cruelly, it replaced all the girls names with Disney characters, and believe me it is as stupid as it sounds. The point is is disneys drastic standards scare me a bit because if you recall the part where mei and satsuki are bathing with there father... well this may not be appropriate in the eyes of a certain little mouse... come on this is Disney! I have a bit of a worry that they might cut that scene and that would really suck, I mean come on they turned down the publishing rights to a great movie just because of a little kiss, well anywho you can connect the dots yourself and wait for the DVD, i just hope our furry little friend comes in with a big roar and not full of bullet holes... (wow what a crappy analogy i can't believe i could not think of anything better! I mean on a scale of 1-10 on the crap factor that analogy is 11, geez I mean it really sucks... sucks like a vacume... my god I don't even know how to spell vacume... i'll stop now)Note: Holy merciful ****!!! The release date is 2010, WTF are they smokin I want this now!!! now damn it... Disney I like your movies, but I don't like you, my day will come and you will burn, burn like the setting sun on a midsummersday!Update: Now amazon has the date listed as TBA under avaliabity instead of 2010 as before, I guess they didn't want to scare off Pre-orders, but strangley enough if you look lower at the specifics of the DVD the release date is listed as January 1, 2010... the plot thickens.	5.0	scared	2005-05-03	12	4	8

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A9998RE3AEA95	Alex	This is an excellent childhood story unrivaled by any since &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. The plot involves Satsuke, a girl on the cusp of womanhood, moving into the country with her father and younger sister Mei, where she discovers a child's realm of wonder and make-believe running in parallel to the adults' mundane everyday existence. The family's rickety cottage is filled with easily frightened dust bunnies, and deep within the tangle of roots and branches, in a safe hiding place only a child can access, Totoro, a benign forest creature, makes its lair.The story is a real jewel, simply, elegantly told. The art is of extremely high quality, excellently detailed, bright and clean. The characters are especially well-depicted, complete with expressive body language and realistically animated. In part because of the excellent dub, they are all sympathetic and deeply human, instantly recognizable as real people around us.Especially evocative is the portrayal of the children's make-believe world, full of things and places that are there only if you believe in them, like the giant Totoro and his entourage of two tiny, roly-poly furballs, and the magnificent &quot;cat-bus&quot; with great shining eyes and two mice announcing the next stop - the exact place you want to go.A fantastic, enchanting examination of a child's mentality, that is also a mainstay family film.	5.0	Totororrific!	2001-06-29	75	72	3

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	ABRAQ8GMVUU95	Amazon Customer	And to think I almost missed this treasure. It is an absolutely beautiful tale for children of all ages and those of us who still have the ability to lose ourselves in fantasy worlds. What I really appreciate is the story's ability to let me forget our times, to some extent.  When the little girl was playing in the backyard by herself while her father worked inside, I found myself worrying whether it was safe. When she crawled into the brush following one of the creatures, I fretted that someone might be waiting to do her harm.  The more I watched, the more I relaxed. In this world, nothing bad was going to happen. It actually makes you shift your everyday gears and enjoy the moment. It is as sweet and gentle as it appears to be.  If for no other reason than to be able to relax and forget your cares, you should purchase My Neighbor Totoro, for yourself as well as your children.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1IR8RMMF9VRXM	Amazon Customer	Even in this badly presented tape (mono,fullsreen and new recorded opnening and ending song), the true quality of Tonari no Totoro shines bright, surpasing easily everything made by Disney.Totoro needs no big epic story, it has characters you will care for, with well developed backgrounds and the best dubbing i've ever heared.  He needs no violence, there is none in it. Totoro tells you funny, charming and a few sad situations in the japanese countryside of the 50's. There so many loving details of the life and living in that period. So many scenes of the children simply experiencing natur and the wonders of Totoro. The music (including the original songs) is a masterpiece. Jo Hisaishi composed for most of Miyazaki works and as usual did a magnificent work of art. For Hayao Miyazaki himself, its my favorit Film of the best Director in the Animation business. This is a major treat for children and grownups of all ages.Buy this one. See it. Experience it.	5.0	The Masters Masterpiece	2000-12-23	1	1	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1IPKOVAFRVMP6	Amazon Customer	"It is the oddest thing how big a fan of Hayao Miyazaki's animated films I have become this year.  I remember catching a few of them as a child and loving them, ""Valley of the Wind"" being one, but the timelessness of the stories and the mature, relatable themes woven throughout what might seem like only a child's cartoon were obviously lost on me at the time.Next to Sprirted Away and Princess Mononoke, I think My Neighbor Totoro has to be one of my favorite's.  Kids will gobble up the frantic, fantastical feel of the film and the fact that they deal with a parental figure having cancer (although it's never spoken of by name, I read that Miyazaki wrote this while dealing with his own mother's bout) is truly inspiring and brave.What's even more amazing is it's basically plot-free and lacking any actual true villan or conflict, yet due to the remarkable voice performances, the attention to detail in the family dynamics and the animation (not to mention the ""What the #$F! was he smoking?"" creatures) the movie moves quickly along and manages to keep you involved and leave you smiling.At least it did for me.  I was in a lousy mood and this cured it pretty fast.Anyway, if you have kids or are still a kid at heart I'd check it out if I were you.Miyazaki is a true artist in every sense of the word."	5.0	Everyone needs a Totoro!	2006-05-02	2	1	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AK0CENM3LUM28	Amazon Customer	"My Neighbor Totoro / B0001XAQ0A*Spoilers*This movie is very different from what I'm used to, especially for a movie marketed for children. Rather than having some over-all story arch, the movie follows several days in the life of two normal little girls, to whom magical things happen, but with ""mundane"" results. In other words, where one might expect flashy, exciting changes to the protagonists' lives (like so many Disney movies), instead we see quiet improvements in a happy, normal family.While this is very nice, and certainly very different, I confess that my initial reaction was to give it 3 stars, because the movie can be rather slow and tedious is some parts if you are not in the right ""frame of mind"" to appreciate such a slow-paced movie. However, my overall impression of the movie is that of 4 stars, simply because I felt compelled to keep watching to the end.The animation for this very different movie is beautiful and it is certainly quite relaxing to watch this lazy-paced, fantastical movie. The two children are realistically children, though sometimes realistic to the point of annoyance - I can't decide if the youngest sister repeats everything her older sister says verbatim out of a realistic desire to imitate her big sister, or if it was an attempt to save on translating costs, but I cheekily concede that it was likely the former, not the latter.If you decide to watch this movie, be prepared for the cinematic equivalent of spending a sunny afternoon in a hammock - you're not doing anything much, but it feels kind of good to slow down for once.This movie provides closed captions for the hearing impaired.~ Ana Mardoll"	4.0	Strangely Compelling	2009-03-13	2	2	0

I prefer the original dub and I like the widescreen.  I wish they could have combined the best of both.  Then it'd be perfect.  If I had to choose between the two, I'd probably opt for the original because I really prefer the opening theme singer and the dubs of the two girls.  But if you must have widescreen, original japanese, and extra features, then by all means go for the 2-disc set.

I was never a fan of animation, that is until I saw My Neighbor Tororo. This movie was wonderful! It's a touching tale of the friendship between two sister and a bunch of wonderful and friendly totoros. The soundtrack is fabulous and the animation/artwork is indescribable. I went out the next day and bought my own copy of this movie and became a collector of Totoro stuffed toys, posters, etc..., and also a great admirer of Hiyao Miyazaki. He is truly a master storyteller and Disney really needs to get it together and release his movies (I believe they bought the right for American distribution) and release his other masterpieces to the public.

It is absolutely disgusting that with all of the versatility of the DVD format Fox films would not include a Japanese track on this film.  The movie was already in Japanese!  There is no good reason whatsoever that they would remove the Japanese track.  I am amazed and shocked.  I advance ordered it because the whole point of DVD's is that the problem of not being able to find a copy of a foreign movie in the original language was supposed to have been solved years ago.  I never would have possibly guessed that they would go to all of the trouble to remaster the movie for DVD and then step back into the stone age like this.  This movie absolutely should have included both an English and a Japanese track.  This is one of my favorite movies.  I have been looking forward to this release for a long time.  I am astonished.  I am near to tears.  Do not order this edition of this movie, please.  Send Fox Films a message.  Just order something else please.	1.0	I returned it unopened	2002-12-25	97	75	22

The problem with this blu-ray set is the Fanning sisters. All of the charm of the sisters in the movie is lost on the voices that just don't match. I mean Mae is like two or three years old. Having a mature kid's voice come out of her mouth is like, &#34;What the what??&#34; Even my six-year-old who also loves the original and has it on vhs asked me if this was a different movie. We both lost interest while watching.So the one star is ONLY because Disney ruined this movie.

Unfortunate they sold their rights to ABC family and thus there are no more remakes of this.There is a law that forbids movies to be released again until 4 years have passed with the same titles. So Disney thought it be cute to have Dakota fanning and her sister dub this movie again....boy where they wrong..it sounds horrible compared to Fox Family's version (I own two of the fox family copies because one is unopen and the other is for enjoyment)Another thing that pisses me off is the movie cover is a mesh of satsuki and mei instead of satsuki carrying mei on her back.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	1988 gave us one of the greatest animated films of all time, `The Grave of the Fireflies', a film that still haunts me and continues to develop strongly in my mind.  That very same year, another animated film that has garnered incredible praise was released; `My Neighbor Totoro'.  Personally, I wasn't as keen to see this one as I was the former, and in my ignorance I assumed that this film was going to be mere child's play.  To my astonishment, the two films work as beautiful companion pieces and I was taken aback by how honest and pure this film was.For me, this film broaches a lot of the same themes that `The Grave of the Fireflies' does, but in a more accessible and hopeful way.  Instead of relying on the grim realities of life to buy into our appreciation, `My Neighbor Totoro' takes a more liberal approach and manages to capture an honest look at a child's reaction to the tragedies that life tosses our way.Here we are introduced to young Satsuki and Mei, two sisters who move into the country with their father.  Their mother is sick and in the hospital, and the two girls await her release so that they can be a family again.  In the meantime, the girls bond with a neighbor who offers her assistance in their mother's absence and the two girls also catch the eye of a spirit named Totoro.  Totoro gives the children a distraction during the turmoil at home and offers them an outlet for their bent up frustrations.  Despite being saddled with some heavy baggage, the girls are able to find solace in Totoro's giant arms.Director Hayao Miyazaki does a fantastic job of allowing the audience to understand what is going on in the minds of these young protagonists.  What I loved so much about `My Neighbor Totoro' is that it understood what it was like to be a child in this grave circumstance and it captured that avenue of adolescence without every once being overly saccharine or trying too hard to beat us over the head with the realities of it all.  In fact, the relevance of Totoro himself doesn't become fully fleshed out until the film's end, which is a wonderful way to keep mystery and a slight suspense to the whole thing.Like I said, this is a great companion piece to `The Grave of the Fireflies'.  It adds an avenue of hope, lacing the final frames, a hope that `The Grave of the Fireflies' doesn't possess.  It is that hope that possibly (the ruling is still out) makes this the better film.  I said possibly, and quite frankly they are BOTH masterpieces.	5.0	A glimmer of hope saves the day...	2013-08-13	1	1	0

They help him around the house, and soon discover that they can see what other's can't. They see Totoro. What is a Totoro? I hope you watch for yourself to find out. Like most of Miyazaki's work, this movie is rooted in Shintoism; a religion consisting of over 8 million gods. These spirits are characterized and appear childish, but the films depth shines through the shoddy marketing if you give it a chance.It's a great movie, for kids & adults and I'm very glad it's getting a DVD. However, I'm pretty disappointed in the DVD. It's got a sticker proudly saying that it's a two disc edition, but that second disc, like ""Nausicaa"", is the storyboard. Only the storyboard. I'm not sure even the director would watch the ENTIRE storyboard of this film. Basically, the second disc is worthless. The ""Behind the Microphone"" is nice, but runs less than 10 minutes and tells nothing that we don't know about Miyazaki from other halfassed ""documentaries"" on various Miyazaki DVD's.The film is great, and highly recommended. I just can't get behind this DVD. It's nice to see it released, but with nothing to look forward to besides the Japanese language track, it's pretty embarrassing.

Thank goodness I rented this version before I went to buy it today. I have to agree with the April 8 review. My kids sat down to watch it with me and said, ""What have they done to the voices?"". We couldn't believe it. Disney has gotten hold of it, and for some reason, felt they had to change it to re-package it, and put well-known Hollywood actors' voices to it. What a mistake. Thanks to the reviews here, I went and bought the original Fox version, although it costs about 1/3 more.

When I first saw it with the children I was afraid they would get  bored after the fast-paced and horror-infested children's movies that are  so typical today, even when they come from Disney.  But although Totoro's  well-rendered scenes are long and can stay unmoving except for a passing  butterfly for 10 seconds or more, somehow this seems to add to the  suspense. Also the story is mostly about simple pleasures in the Japanese  countryside and the scare doesn't go beyond a lost 5-year-old. Still, the  sweet story and the enchanting creatures hold the interest of my 4-7 year  olds time and time again. Totoro is a perfect example that children don't  need the hero to save the planet and fight and kill dozens of monsters in  the process to have a good time.	5.0	Sweet and beautiful	2000-08-22	2	2	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1WB5NZYY5XR8A	"Ash1138 ""Just a middle aged guy living in Col..."	Hayao Miyazaki isn't just a master director of animation. He's one of the greatest film makers since the invention of the motion picture. No amount of writing in this review can convince you one way or the other until you've seen a Miyazaki film. I don't even have to pick a group of films to select from as they are all that good.I recently found a japanese version...that had an english audio track (in addition to japanese with english subtitles), and I got to rediscover this film masterpiece once again. It's every bit, if not better, than I remember it. Miyazaki's made three films since I last saw this; two of which (Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away) I got to see on the big screen so it's easy to forget how good the film really is.Please, do not let the hideous cover art on this poor DVD version fool you. Unfortunately, the American mindset is that animation is for kids alone so every animated film needs to be doctored up to look extraordinarily childish. Totoro is no exception; the cover looks like it's meant for pre-schoolers. Blech!! Certainly most of Miyazaki's films (with the exception of Mononoke) are suitable for all ages, they are not targeted for that audience and are in fact more appealing to adults than to children.The storyline of Totoro involves two children: Satsuki who is around 11 years old and her little sister Mei who is about 4-5 years old. They have just moved into a new home with their father in the rural countryside that is rumored to be haunted. Their mother is ailing of an unknown condition and resides at a hospital several hours away. The story is one of utmost simplicity, really being more of an excerpt in the lives of these two girls than anything resembling a complicated plot. Right next to the house they've moved into exists an enormous camphor tree where the sisters eventually discover resides the king of the forest, Totoro. The film besides being animated and dealing with spirits of the forest, is incredibly realistic. The portrayal of the two sisters is better performed and more realistic than any hollywood film animated or not.You simply must see this film to understand as should other film makers who could learn many things from this master. Understand though, that this version of the DVD is as cheap as they come with the presentation leaving lots to be desired. True film fans may wish to find an import version with the english sub as well as dub with widescreen.	5.0	Learn the name: Hayao Miyazaki	2003-01-27	2	1	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AGNR3IYCPUNLQ	"Athey Moravetz ""Athey"""	I have loved this movie for years.  It's probably my all-time favorite film, and is perfect for anyone, of any age.There are two releases of this film to American audiences.  The first company to have the license was Fox and the DVD they released only has an English dub track.  Generally this is a huge turn-off for me, HOWEVER it is a very good dub, especially considering how often Fox butchers anime.  They didn't mess it up at all, and the voice actors on that version are actually very very good.The second US release is from Disney.  They obtained the rights to the original film and re-released it with a new dub track and two discs, the original Japanese, etc. etc. Lots of fancy extras.  This DVD listed for sale here is the Disney Release.  Once again, good voice actors were chosen, so even the dub track is done well.  (Dakota Fanning and her younger sister play the two sisters in the film so they have good chemistry together).My daughter is almost two years old.  I first popped in Totoro (the fox dub) in her in-car DVD player when she was about 16 months old, during a very long road trip to visit her grandparents.  SHE LOVES THIS MOVIE.  OMG I cannot emphasize how much she loves this film.  She brings the DVD case to me all the time at home now asking for me to put it on the TV for her.She loves the early sequence when Mai and Satsuki first explore their new house; running around wildly and laughing.  She loves Totoro, she loves the Catbus.  She loves it all.  She'll watch the whole thing too! Which is incredible considering that no other movie or TV show tends to hold her attention for more then a 10 minutes.For young children, either version of the US release is good because both have very good dub tracks.  For any anime enthusiast the new release from Disney is a must.  It includes a very accurate subtitle translation, original music, lots of special features including the entire movie in storyboards on disc 2, and even the dub track is still done very well.	5.0	A MUST Buy, especially if you have young children	2008-02-05	3	3	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A10EH95EUDO9W3	"Banshee ""Beeyotch"""	This can be classified as a true children's story without the whole gaudy  mess of overproductive toy tie-in, fad-spreading, or such snotty adolescent  attitude and behavior in the characters. Instead, it is simply about a  loving old daddy who takes his carefree little daughters out to live in the  country while their mother lies ill in a nearby hospital. Oh, how the two  young girls squealed and went racing right out of the old moving truck to  dance and do cartwheels on the open meadowland! And how they explored  wide-eyed through the empty cardboards and corners of the slightly run-down  old hut about to become their home. In fact, not even the very young  toddler in pigtails got spooked by the sudden swarm of those odd  spider-like house spirits flying right into her chubby face! And what's  more, the two little girls suddenly discovered something truly magical deep  into the very midst of the forest undergrowth: a monstrous forest sprite  that looks just like a gigantic, overstuffed bunny doll. Thus the two tiny  girls are suddenly whisked off on such wild, breezy fantasy adventures  typical of Alice in Wonderland. So beautifully made and so driven with real  emotion as well as some gentle little humor and a real eye for fine art. A  very amusing family film indeed! However, there's just one little thing  that really disappointed me: even the nicest grown-ups couldn't see any of  those fabulous creatures that the small kids had encountered and thus  befriended. But hey, it's a private little world meant for young children -  so no hard feelings at all.	5.0	What a sweet, innocent fairy tale by Hayao Miyazaki!	2000-06-24	1	1	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2ISLYXRJMET3L	B. Churchill	"Wow, there sure are a lot of people complaining about the new Disney dub on ""My Neighbor Totoro""!  Having seen both English dubbed versions, my feeling is the complete opposite.  I much prefer Disney's dub to the old Fox dub.  The reason for this is that it seemed that Fox (or whoever dubbed it for them) wasn't as concerned with authenticity.  The most glaring thing was the voice of Mei in the Fox dub.  It was done by the woman who voices Angelica Pickles in the Rugrats cartoon.  Now, I really don't like adults doing ""kid"" voices, and every time I heard Mei speak, I couldn't get the image of Angelica out of my head!  At least with the Disney dub, they got two real girls to voice the characters, and I thought Elle Fanning did a great job on Mei.  Ok, maybe a bit too ""screechy"", but still fairly believable as a four year old.  The only things about the Disney dub that I didn't like were the song changes, and the fact that they dubbed over Totoro and Catbus (why bother with non-talking creatures?).  However, I am still going to say that I prefer the Disney dub to the Fox dub.So, for those of you out there who are trying to get an idea on whether to buy the new DVD or not, just use your own judgment, and don't pay so much attention to the complaints about the dub.

This movie takes place in Japan pre-WWII and revolves around 2 young girls moving into a mysterious new house on the edge of a forest. Together they become friends with the King of the Forest: Totoro. Kids and adults of all ages fell in love with Totoro when the movie was 1st released in Japan and he continues to be a merchandising powerhouse (and logo) for Studio Ghibli--the Japanese Disney--even today.Totoro, however, is better than your average Disney flick. No singing candlesticks, no violence, no death. The drama comes from family situations from a childs point of view. And not everything in this film is pre-packaged and shrink-wrapped. The story allows a childs imagination to work into the story, too.If you're just a parent looking for a great DVD for your kids, then get this DVD now! It's a bargain at $10. However, if you're a fan of anime and the DVD format in general, I suggest you wait until Aug. 2004 when a special 2 disc DVD set is released in the USA by Disney of all people.	5.0	A Kid Classic	2004-04-02	1	1	0

I have been waiting a long time for a US DVD release which I finally received last week.I was surprised to find that the movie has been re-dubbed, featuring the voices of Dakota and Elle Fanning as the sisters Satsuki and Mei.  The original English dub on the VHS release is far superior.  Unfortunately the English dub in this version has been completely Americanized, losing much of the charm of the original.  You can see the difference if you turn on the English soundtrack along with the English subtitles.  The subtitles are a much better reflection of the original Japanese language script.  At least you can watch the dvd in Japanese with English subtitles, bypassing the poor dub.It's a shame Disney apparently felt that Americans would not appreciate a real ""Japanese"" flavored film, which to me is a big part of this movie's charm.That said, My Neighbor Totoro is still a wonderful film, for children and adults and it's great to finally own a widescreen copy on dvd."	4.0	THE NEW 2 DISC DVD VERSION - DUB NOT AS GOOD AS ORIGINAL	2006-03-14	8	8	0

Pinkerton ""teddy cuddles"""	Having watched only a few of Hayao Miyazaki's films, I wasn't sure what to expect with the film 'My Neighbor Totoro' as I hadn't heard much about it.  I bought the film on a chance, then I sat down to watch it.  It's such a lovely film, well worth watching with the family or even on your own.  The scenes are beautiful, the story is lovely and the characters are an absolute delight. I love the relationship between the two sisters - Satsuki & Mei.  They bounced off each other, perfectly.  Satsuki being protective of her little sister Mei, who takes delight in everything around her.  I loved it when Satsuki met Totoro for the first time, in the rain, while waiting for the bus.  Then, of course the surprise of the Cat Bus! I would highly recommend this movie - even if you haven't seen a Hayao Miyazaki film.  Once you see it, I guarantee you'll want to see more!	5.0	A Beautiful Story, a Beautiful Film!	2010-04-10	3	3	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3MQQS40FK2QAQ	"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle"""	"There is a moment in ""My Neighbor Totoro"" that demonstrates what sets it apart from so many so-called family films. Four year old Mei has wandered into the giant tree chasing two little creatures called Totoros. She falls into a pit and lands near a giant sleeping totoro. Eventually she falls asleep. When her big sister Satsuki returns home she and their father discover her. Mei tells them about the totoro.A lesser children's film would have the father believe she was making it up, and the two children would soon not trust their father and go to great lengths to keep the creature a secret. But the father in ""My Neighbor Totoro"" believes his children are telling the truth. He believes it so much that he thanks the spirits for watching after Mei. The father can be a little absent minded, but he has such a good heart and is a kind person who loves his two daughters. When was the last time a family entertainment was about two sisters instead of two brothers, or a brother and sister?That is one of the magics of ""My Neighbor Totoro"". It demonstrates that family films don't have to be about children whose parents die in the first scene, or have evil villains, comical sidekicks, or even songs. (Only two songs occur at the beginning and end. One of them has nothing to do with the story.) It also has a character (a boy next door) that made me laugh not because he was acting funny, but because he behaved in the exact way that boys his age acted around girls.When I wasn't laughing at some of this film, I had a very big grin on my face. I was caught up in this family, as well as the neighbors. The totoro's completely won me over. The giant one was like a big fat cat when it sleeps.I would like to mention another scene. The father and his two girls enjoy a bath together. This was a scene I feared would cause some concern with parents I recommended the movie to at Hollywood Video. I had a response to them: In Japan it is traditional for families to enjoy evening baths together, although they take a quick shower before entering the bathtub together. It is considered impolite otherwise. The scene is interesting and something that would be very unlikely to be shown in any American film, let alone a family entertainment. Disney certainly wouldn't include such a scene. I believe it is a scene that parents could discuss with their children involving the differences between American and Japanese cultures. But in all my years at Hollywood Video not one parent ever came back showing such concern.I would like to finish by indicating that the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurowsawa called ""My Neighbor Totoro"" one of the best films he had ever scene. To have such an honor given by someone who was considered at that time to be the greatest living director says a lot for any film. But for an animated film, it's truly an astonishing achievement. Seeing ""My Neighbor Totoro"", I can understand why Kurowsawa would say that. It is one of the best family films ever made.FOOTNOTES: Some of the review is information from Helen McCarthy's fantastic book: ""Hayao Miyazaki, Master of Japanese Animation"". It is available at Amazon.com(Special Update): Since I originally wrote this review, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO has been re-released twice on DVD by Disney, with an updated English dub. The other release is a re-packaged one that was put out at the same time Miyazaki's PONYO was released. This new dub features Dakota Fanning and her real-life sister Elle as Satsuki and Mei. The movie is not only flawlessly dubbed but is completely uncut with the original music and effects soundtrack. My opinion has not been changed. It is still an absolute delight all the way through."	5.0	One of the 10 best family films, ever!	2002-02-01	11	11	0

For those of you who don't know him, CatBus is a Bus that's a Cat...or a Cat that's a Bus...phew...that alone is worth five stars.Ok, now that you know about the CatBus let me say a thing or two about the rest of the movie.  This is great animation with an excellent story for kids, immature adults, or anyone who is in a really bad mood.  If you are over the age of 30 and you want to regress quickly into childhood just watch this.  Or, better yet, if you have children and want to give them something good to watch instead of &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven 4: Rex and the Right Hand of God&quot; then I would say buy this movie.

She's always loved it, so i got it for her for christmas. The only thing I didn't realize is that they changed the characters voices. Also, they redid some of the parts in the movie, which I thought was completely unnessary. I hate the people they picked to re-do the voices, Dakota Fanning for example. They didn't need to do this, I wish that they still sold the original on amazon.

It became one of our all time favorite movies. It was so amazing, so different from anything we had ever seen. My little sister fell completely in love with it, and watched it whenever she had a chance.When we saw this new special two-disk, digitally remastered set was relesed we didn't wait for a second to buy it. We popped it into the DVD player completely enthralled.  We got about ten minutes into the movie before turning it off in complete disbelief and anger.I can't understand why they would do something like this. Why would they take an amazing, wonderful piece of art and smash it into pieces? I have nothing against Dakota Fanning or her little sister, but their voice performances were NOTHING compared to the original. You get a COMPLETLY different experience watching this new version. I just couldn't understand why they would do something like this.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3ERV1420MTP1Q	Bryan Jensen	"""My Neighbor Totoro"" is certainly one of Hayao Miyazaki's most magical, and it is nice to see the Special Edition version released. But one would expect the Most Special Thing of such a release should be the best quality picture possible for a DVD.The Disney-fied English dub -- that is, their propensity to re-record audio using actors whose names the public will better recognize in order to sell these more broadly -- is pretty good. (It's an understandable compromise considering Miyazaki's films deserve wider recognition.) And not too surprising the audio mastering effort given to English was not duplicated for the Japanese language track. (Although it's a bummer!) But it's the same English audio that was released in the widescreen version from 2006. Nothing new here.The MOST IMPORTANT of a release is the quality of the movie picture itself -- And Disney sold out and short-changed us. They did not have the film restored nor remastered. Yes, it is better than the Full Screen DVD edition that was released in the early 2000s. But it is not improved on the widescreen DVD version released in 2006. Still, to my eye, it looks too grainy and soft, and with a lot of artifact flicker. It's really a shame, given the advantages of releasing together with ""Ponyo"" that they wouldn't take the opportunity to have Lowry Digital restore this film's image quality like they've had them do for so many Disney animated classics. And for that matter, had Lowry done the work on this we could have seen a Blu-ray edition as well.The other Miyazaki films released in this latest Special Edition wave -- ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Castle In The Sky"" -- have video quality that is not improved over earlier DVD releases, either. These releases are a scar on the legacy of John Lasseter's creative Disney leadership to supposedly champion more 2D animation, and especially because of his affection for Hayao Miyazaki's work. My low rating is a reflection on what Disney has done here, and not on the filmmaking itself."	2.0	Disney short-changes this Special Edition	2010-03-08	10	8	2

In fact, they watched it over and over again with almost as much enthusiasm as the kids!That night, we all went to a store, and each family  bought copies for themselves.It's not Miyazaki's masterpiece - that title has to go to ""Spirited Away"", but it's still one of my all time favorite films."	5.0	The King of the Forest, reighs.	2007-10-30	2	2	0

Scanlon	When I saw the US premiere of Spirited Away I was thrilled to hear the Gibli studio representative tell us that all of Miyazaki's movies would be released in the US within the next two years.Disney studios (since they apparently feel the need to control all feature length animation in the US) was to handle the distribution.  Apparently, like the fable goes, once they had it they didn't want it anymore and sold it to Fox to do with what they would.What they have done, and this won't be news if you've read some of the other reviews here, is to release a very inexpensive product, but you get what you pay for.Specifically, pan and scan instead of widescreen and English dub only.If you are looking for a nice movie for children, and you are not familiar with Miyazaki's work, this version should be OK.To most adults my advice is to get yourself to your nearest search engine and find yourself a widescreen version with a Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles.	2.0	good movie, bad DVD	2002-12-29	17	15	2

I feel bad for the children that don't ever see the real version wherethe story is told as if to someone who is intelligent.The first sign that something was terribly wrong is the horrible thing that they did to the simple and fun opening song, and it just goes downhill from there.I am sorry if there was some dispute or something that forced them to make this change. I wish it had been done more respectfully for the wonderful artwork that it was intended to be. If you are looking to buy this, most certainly get a used DVD of the original.

If you never seen this before well I would suggest getting the Fox version.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2YXMN40D7WTGP	casualsuede	While not as good, or complex as Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind or Princess Mononoke, this gentle fairy tale is still a beautiful.  It is  actually two story's in one.  The first is the fairy tale.  Two young girls  arrive in their new home, in the Japanese countryside and immediately find  that their home is &quot;haunted&quot; by Dust Bunnies and Totoro (a rabbit  like spirit that come in different sizes).  The second story involves the  children's mother, who is in the hospital with a mysterious disease  (Miyazaki later revealed in interviews that the children's mother had TB),  and how the children and their father deal with the sad situation.The  two sisters are very real, Sasuke is the more responsible elder sister and  May is the younger 5 year old who seems wiser beyond her years.  The  dubbing is done with professional care and one of the best out there.  We  go with them, share their quirks (like yelling to scare away ghosts), find  exciting discoveries and meeting &quot;interesting&quot; characters (like  the 10 foot Chelshire Cat/Bus borrowed from Alice in Wonderland).  I loved  the ending and don't turn the tape off while the credits roll.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1B4E6LYWTQYM2	"Cat lover ""Cat lover"""	This was my all time favorite movie when I was a child. I was thrilled when it came out on DVD and I bought it right away. But I was so very disappointed when I watched it. The voices were different, they had recorded over the original dialogue and even changed some of the words. In one scene in the beginning the youngest girl found a little pond with tadpoles in it and she called them tadpoles, but in the original movie the little girl called them golleywolleypogs. Inwardly I couldn't help but reject this movie because the voices were just wrong and so was the dialogue. It made me very sad I couldn't enjoy it  like I did before. I know that may seem petty but I can't help it, I've watched the DVD several times hoping I could get used to it but I can't. But I'll give it a 3 because I absolutely love the story and I always will.	3.0	It's a good movie if you never saw it on VHS	2014-05-01	3	2	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A15Z7E8XPOUYZZ	"C. Chen ""Kickin' it"""	This was originally released by Fox in 1993 on VHS.  That's quite a while before Japanese animation boom really began here in the US.  It's also quite a long while before Disney snatched up the rights to many of Myazaki's other films.When Fox brought this over, they were taking a chance.They weren't sure that it would make money.  Of course they marketed it to kids.  The adult animation market wasn't anything like what it is today.  Of course they pan-n-scanned it.  Pan-n-scan versus widescreen isn't an issue for most kids, even today.  Of course they dubbed it.  For the time especially, the dubbed cast is amazing.From the year when such mundane titles as The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (the horribly bright version, not the dramatic one) was capturing kids on television and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (not one, not two, but three!) was doing just fine in the box offices, bringing Totoro to the states was a gamble for Fox.  They pulled it off splendidly.The cast is great.  The animation isn't nearly as bright as the box-art, but it isn't supposed to be.  In this movie, Myazaki is trying to show the real world more than the one that exists in his imagination.  Even if the magical creatures had been removed, this would have been an excellent movie.  It's a movie about values and responsibility, but with giant cat-busses and dust fairies thrown in for some fun.It's the element of realism that makes this movie outstanding.  When the girls meet Totoro, we're apprehensive with them.  When they visit their mother in the hospital, we feel sympathy for them.  And when Mai gets lost, we are scared and cry along with Satsuki.  The fact that we never really know what could happen is what makes this movie great.  There's so many surprises around every corner that we're even ready for the shock of Mai dying when it becomes a possibility.This is a kid's movie.  I never got the chance to see it in Japanese or in widescreen, but even if I did, I don't think I could dislike Fox's version.  This is the movie that made me fall in love with Japanese Animation and with Myazaki's work in particular.  I don't care about Japanese language tracks or pan-n-scan.  What really sold me on this movie was the fact that it made me feel like a kid at a time when I wanted to be anything but.  It made me feel good inside.  It still does.	5.0	Please take into account	2003-01-28	4	3	1
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2I6YR7RFUIY2B	"cdrikari ""cdrikari"""	My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful story about what happens 2 young girls and their father move into a country house to be closer to their mother, who is in a nearby hospital.  The animation is stunningly done, with both people and fantasic creatures coming alive to make the story hum.  Voice acting in the original Japanese is great and the english dub is not far behind.  This is one of the best dubs I have heard, with the English voice actors obviously 'getting' their characters and the writers did a good job of not changing the lines except where required.My wife and I both enjoyed this a great deal and was well recieved when given to a family with two daughters, age 6 and 2.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2AEB3FRIOTTY2	"C. Fowlkes ""Diamond Muse"""	I first saw this movie with my little sisters, thinking it was going to be another boring kids movie. A note to anyone who might think the same about My Neighbor Totoro- get over it and see the movie. You'll be so glad you did.What an absolutely enchanting film. The artistry is breathtaking and the story is so touching. How could you describe a film with a big, furry forest god who makes trees grow and a catbus as anything but charming?Satsuki and Mei are very believable characters as young girls who squabble with each other and worry about their sick mother. The childlike innocence these girls possess (which allow them to see the totoros) is something that any adult can envy.And the totoros! They are very sweet, charming creatures. Especially the big guy, the Totoro, who can seem frightening at first with his big claws and even bigger teeth, but as it turns out, the only thing he uses those teeth for is grinning. He sort of adopts the girls, which is just another touching aspect of the story, especially when he enchants them by helping their little garden grow into an enormous, beautiful tree.All in all, Totoro is a wonderful movie that is definitely worth seeing.	5.0	A touching and lovely film	2001-06-13	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A13MM94OD9HMEO	"C. Frederick ""bigswell"""	I have seen this movie many times and I adore it. My five year old adores it.Two little girls form a relationship with a tree spirit in the pre-war Japanese countryside, and they help each other. It's funny, moving, and meditatively paced. The characters are not deeply drawn, as there isn't a ton of dialogue in the movie. But oddly enough, it isn't important to the success of the somewhat mysterious story.The extras DVD has an amazing feature where you can hear the movie's full audio track and watch the original storyboard drawings instead of the finished animation.

This version though left me really cold.Totoro was my favorite movie growing up. I have seen it literally more than any other movie, and I know it almost line for line. So it was really disconcerting to watch this version. It's just... wrong. I suppose that they didn't do a BAD job dubbing it, but its just not the same.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT	Charlie Brooks	"Hayao Miyazaki is a master in the field of anime. My Neighbor Totoro was his pet project for quite a while, and it is quite possibly still his best work.I'm not a fan of calling a film ""magical,"" but it fits here. Everything about this movie makes you feel like a kid again. The animation is gorgeous, and imagination oozes from every frame. There isn't a whole lot of conflict here, but that's perfectly okay. This film is just fun and fantastic from beginning to end. It's like Miyazaki opened up his imagination and invited us all inside.Watching My Neighbor Totoro, you are in for something weird and wonderful.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AW2JK3A7L5IFN	Chouster	"Miyazaki is simply brilliant and it shows in his works.  This movie exudes charm and can be enjoyed but anyone.If you're not familiar with Studio Ghibli, or Hayao Miyazaki, collectively, they are responsible for a large number of blockbuster Japanese animation films.  Studio Ghibli's movies are only beginning to gain a presence in the North American market, in spite of the fact that they have been released years ago.  Many have been influenced by these movies including John Lasseter, director of Pixar's A Bug's Life and the Toy Story series.  He calls Miyazaki's works as being ""the most inspirational films"".This movie is about a father and his two daughters who have moved into a new house located in a rural village.  While the mother is in the hospital, the two girls begin to explore the surroundings of their new dwelling.  In one unexpected chance, Mei discovers a Totoro.  Without spoiling too much, the film explores the encounter and their subsequent meetings.Although the plot does not seem overly complex, it needn't be.  It takes a simple plot and still manages to capture your interest.Intertwined with a great soundtrack, this movie is for anyone.  I would greatly encourage anyone to delve into the Studio Ghibli world of animation."	5.0	Wonderful movie	2004-10-09	5	4	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AWOTAUJ4478CT	Chris	First off I want to say I do not hate Totoro, I hate what disney has done wit it. Now if you are looking for a wonderful story about a loving family who are separated by unfortunate circumstances and then reunited in the end, then this is not the DVD for you. Yes it is still the same basic story line, and yes it is still the same basic animation. However disney has ruined it with their new voice actors and remastering. If you truly love the work of Miyazaki then find yourself the original VHS version of this film and buy that. Dakota Fanning and her little sister need to stay away from anime and the classic works of a great artist and writer. As for that disney needs to stay away from anime, they already destroy every day animation leave a beautiful work of art alone, I mean have you seen the recent releases from disney? My six month old nephew can draw better than that and come up with a more compelling story line. Totoro is a wonderful story about a family separated by their mothers sickness and the wonder of childhood, it is a beautiful, timeless story. I grew up with the works of Miyazaki, I came to love anime because of Totoro, Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service and Miyazakis other works. My little sister bought this from costco and when she brought it home we were expecting it to be the story we had come to love so much when we were children. But that's not what we received, this is an atrocity an absolute atrocity that disney is aloud to do this. If you truly love anime and love Miyazaki and his works then please do not buy this, make sure you check the actors check the case get as much information as you can before you buy. You do not want to have your heart broken like me and my little sister did. we are desperately searching for the original we have on VHS and I urge anyone who has the original to hold onto it and cherish it like it deserves to be cherished.	1.0	Please read before you buy	2011-09-22	15	9	6

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1Q08H4B9QGT2N	"Christy ""MommyOfRedHeads"""	I am studying Japanese for work so we got this movie and several of the other Ghibli movies as well.  Totoro is one of my favorites.  Just to give you an understanding of my perspective, I generally don't like Anime but I like Ghibli.In Totoro, I don't like the English voice overs very much but I think that is probably largely because I got used to hearing the Japanese version.  It seems like they have a lot of uneccesary dialogue in the English version.  Our small kids (1.5 and 3 yrs old) watch this movie all the time.  Compared to a normal movie there actually isn't all that much going on in terms of storyline but it is so pleasant that I don't mind at all.I think that another big selling point is how effectively they conveyed the feelings of the kids.  I can see my own 2 girls in them.  Another high point for me is that the music fits the movie perfectly.  Our daughter is in a Japanese preschool right now and they play the theme song all the time (the kids march around the room while they are playing it since the song is about going for a walk).  As a parent who finds many other children's movies agonizing I give this movie 3 thumbs up!As for the other Ghibli movies, Totoro is definitely the #1 instant classic of them all but I also really like Porco Rosso (kids like it), Pom Poko (warning - very weird movie - but fun, our kids aren't interested in it at all), Howl's moving Castle (kids neutral on it), Cat's Return (kids like it), Kiki (kids LOVE it, maybe even more than Totoro), and Spirited Away (kids neutral on it).  Laputa and Nausica were decent.  I didn't like Grave of the Fireflies - it is just too much of a downer sad story for me, I like the happier stuff better.	5.0	I love this movie!	2009-05-06	2	2	0

In particular the little girl, Mei. Also the title song vocals have been redone. (I guess Disney felt they could get a better singer)It looses a lot of the ""feel"" of the original DVD and VHS tapes. I have to rate this very low as I was very disappointed and expected to find the original version intact when I bought it. I have not used this DVD at all and have not even bothered selling it.

Miyazaki's animation skill and his attention to detail is amazing.  The behaviors of the children are so classic of Japanese children - I love to watch this movie and be transported back to rural Japan and re-live the the visits I have had with my Japanese friends and families.  This movie expresses the innocence and imagination of all children in a veritable and gentle manner.  It has universal appeal and is enjoyed by my adult friends as well as my children.  Miyazaki's ability to tell his story through visual means transcends most movies dependence on language, pyrotechnics and computer enhancements.  I think the movie is best viewed using the Japanese language selection - the viewer is transported through images and language inflections and tones to a world of innocence, magic and reverance of nature.  I give this movie 2 thumbs and 8 fingers up!  Thank you Siskel and Ebert for introducing me to Miyazaki and his magic.	4.0	Tonari no Totoro an animation classic	2011-09-21	1	1	0

The Japanese (Region 2) contains two disks.  The first disk contains the movie, with Japanese in 2 channel stereo (the sound is excellent) and English in Mono.  There are also subtitles in Japanese and English available.  The picture is also excellent, and in 16:9 letterbox format.  On the second disk is the movie again, but you can switch between the movie and Miyazawa's beautiful conte storyboards:  you can play the storyboards like a movie with the original soundtrack underneath like a narrated picturebook.  It also contains previews of other Ghibli movies, a featurette on Miyazaki design (Japanese only) and original artwork.  I hope that this release of Tonari no Totoro is released in the US.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A28S1IDP6E1MHD	Clarice Mosier	My Neighbor Totoro is a Studio Ghibli film not as widely know in the United States as others like Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and the most recent Ponyo. Miyazaki is on of the most creative story tellers of modern time. Totoro was one of his first movies coming out in 1988 with animation well beyond its time. It was so well received and loved in in Japan that it spurred a movement to protect Japans forests. (Which is where Totoro lives) The story is about two little girls and their father who move to a new house in order to be closer to their sick mother. By and by the little five year old meets Totoro while exploring her new surroundings. Both of the children make friends with him and he ends up coming to their rescue when they are in need. The story is heart warming and will leave you feeling happy after you watch it. The music through out the movie is also wonderful even to listen to by itself. It is also a good movie if you want to learn a bit about Japanese culture. Now there is one thing and this is very important. When Studio Ghibli started to gain more recognition it was noticed by Disney. Disney made a deal with Ghibli and it has the rights to Ghibli films once they reach the US. This movie was well voiced by the people who first did it, but since Disney likes to have big names do the voices they had it redone. It is my opinion that the movie lost a lot of its personality when this happened so that is why I payed more for the original one. I highly recommend that if you are thinking of buying Totoro you opt for the original and hurry because they are in very limited supply.	5.0	Very sweet movie.	2010-10-17	2	1	1
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"A lot of times whenever I see the words ""family film"", it usually means that the film is perfect for kids but adults would merely find it tolerable, as if it's not that entertaining but it's not a bore either. Recently my sister had a kid's show on TV that she loves yet I felt kind of ""meh"" about it. Well Miyazaki films are perfect since they're colorful and imaginative for the kids but they're quite entertaining for the adults too.Satsuki and Mei are 2 girls who have just moved into a new house with their dad. Mei takes a trip to the nearby forest and runs into a Totoro, a forest spirit who resembles a giant rabbit. Soon Satsuki also finds it and the 2 have fun with it. Only thing is is that their mom is in the hospital and Mei does something drastic to go see her.Watching Totoro, you get the sense of you're watching something that fits perfectly with whatever situation you're in. If you're a parent with kids it's perfect but if you're just buying it to watch it that'll work too. Unlike Nausicaa or Mononoke which were maybe a bit too ""adult"", Totoro fits for everyone who just wants to be entertained for an hour and a half.It's certainly an imaginative film but it doesn't have that out-there craziness like other films had. There's no guy with a pig head or giant....bug things or a giant talking wolf. It does have one very odd addition: a bus shaped like a multi-legged cat. But the imagination in a way seems a bit more tamer. In fact, Totoro doesn't show up right away, neither does the Cat Bus and they're not in the movie that much anyway. One thing is that kids might be slightly turned off by the fact that it's not one of those ""everything's perfect"" kid films where the only badness comes from the bad guy. There's no song singing and when Totoro isn't smiling(kind of creepily I might add), he's roaring like crazy.Do yourself a favor and watch the japanese version. It reeks of stunt-casting syndrome that animated films have been doing lately which is to just cast a big star for whatever role you feel like instead of matching the character to the voice(the only 3 I ever liked were Patrick Stewart and Alison Lohman in Nausicaa and Christian Bale). The extras are kind of disappointing since being a 2-disc set you're expecting some huge ensemble of documentaries but there's not a whole lot here.Is it watchable? Definately. Whether or not your kids will love it though depends on what they like. If they prefer big rousing songs and endless comic relief...they might not like it. Imagination and colorful animation? Then they will."	5.0	A family film that's not just for the kids	2006-08-11	6	6	0

This movie takes you back to a time when life was simple, when childhood was full of play, when trees were tall, and fairies lived in your backyard. It is full of whimsy, and the setting is so peaceful and serene. And the art, oh... it is amazing how you can see the wind blowing without seeing the wind, and the water so clear you want to reach in and touch it. The characters were so lovable, especially Mei (the little sister) who is at once innocent, curious and fearless, as we all were, not too long ago... And not forgetting the Totoros, guardians of the forest, who make plants grow and winds blow, and Catbus, with the soft, warm fur. And on quiet moonlit nights, you just might see them sitting on a tree, softly playing their ocarinas....	5.0	Whimsical	2001-12-12	0	0	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1BPLB568L0J54	Crash and Burn	I must rate this DVD in two parts. I'll star with the film. A solid 5 stars. This is a film with something for everyone. The entire family can watch it together and enjoy it. There's no villian, no violence, not crude humor, and no objectional material (the family bath scene is completely innocent) Though very young children will probably not notice, older kids might find some of the movie rather upsetting. Scenes like the mother in the hospital and Mei being lost might bother more sensetive children a bit. That being said, This is still a great film for people of all ages. The english dub may sound a bit goofy at first, but once you're use to it (it only takes a few minutes) the voice acting is good and the dialog is solidPart two of my review will focus on the DVD. I give it a single, lonely star. The only reason it recieves one star is becuse the film does have the video and audio clarity you expect from a DVD. Now for the bad: 1) The cover. I dunno who drew this thing, but it's ugly. 2) No special features. This is especially annoying since the menu sheet says &quot;Acsess 'My Neighbor Totoro' special features by pressing te MENU key on your remote control&quot; well you can press it all day long and it'll only take you to the simple menu. 3) No japanese option. If you're a purist then this is a major fault. 4) the biggest problem with this DVD is that is has no subtitle feature for the hard of hearing. It's closed captioned, but what about people that have old TVs? While the DVD is very basic, it is also very affordable and the movie alone is worth the purchase price	5.0	Miyazaki's most charming film	2003-04-25	6	5	1

The landscapes of the video is like 1960's Japanese countryside altough I  have never seen Totoro and other cute monsters. Hayao Miyazaki made almost  10 movies, but &quot;Totoro&quot; is one of best one. What is other best  one?

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	I normally go out of my way to avoid any anime that's been dubbed, but there are times when I have no choice, and after seeing Princess Mononoke by Hayao Miyazaki, Japan's anime wizard, I decided to check out a title I remember coming out when I worked at a video rental store--My Neighbour Totoro.During the summer, Satsuki and Mei, move with their father to a house in the countryside while their mother convalesces in a hospital.  They have some nice neighbours, particularly the old lady who tends her fields and comes up with bountiful harvests.  However, living nearby in the depths of a humongous camphor tree, are the neighbours who will really transform the young girls' stay into something magical.  Those neighbours are the Totoros.Totoros are funny looking creatures living in a secret world inside a giant camphor tree.  Some come in small sizes, such as the waddling white one seen in the opening credits, shaped like an inverted tooth with webbed feet.  Others are more developed, gray and white that resemble rabbits.  Then there are the giant ones, with gaping toothy grins, claws, and loud roars.  The girls befriend the Totoros and spend some purely magical moments together.  Oh, and apparently, only children can see them, as they are the most prone to imagination, wonder, and fantasy.This charming film depicts Japanese society that is a stark contrast to American society.  The girls' father may work at the university during the day, but Satsuki's role as her younger sister's minder is heavily emphasized, as is that of the kindly Nanny, who looks after the girls when they are alone.  And I can't think of many children today who will wait for their father's return from work at a raining bus stop.The girls themselves are exceptionally unique.  Mei in particular is more courageous and headstrong.  The scene where she chases the two smaller sized Totoros into the camphor tree has shades of Alice In Wonderland.  And when she comes across the giant Totoro, is she scared?  Hardly--in fact she ends up taking a nap on the creatures furry stomach.One interesting concept is that of laughter chasing away soot sprites, or dust bunnies, who inhabit dark, lonely houses.  Definitely a symbol of happy houses having no dark corners.My Neighbour Totoro is the film that first got Hayao Miyazaki notice in America, especially when it was released in the U.S. five years after its release in Japan.  The original Japanese title, Tonari No Totoro, literally means &quot;Totoro From Next Door&quot;, which is close enough to what is translated here, I suppose.  The animation is typical anime, but the warm characterizations of the people are what make this a cut above the rest.  And if you thought the Totoros were creative, check out the cat bus--it has to be seen to be believed.	5.0	One cat-bus ticket to Totoroland, please!	2003-03-09	5	4	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	Hayao Miyazaki has made so many wonderful films that it's difficult to pick one out as his best.  However, this film certainly belongs on a very short list of the best animated films of all time.  Sisters Satsuki and Mei move to an old country home with their father, unaware that they have moved into close proximity with an array of magical creatures who are connected to nature.  This is the perfect family film.  There are no villains , no fights, no scary monsters, yet there is great drama in the sense of discovery that the sisters experience as they learn more about this secret world that exists just next door.  Miyazaki's portrait of a world full of benevolent mystery is very moving.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.	5.0	Gentle, wonderful film	2006-04-14	2	2	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A210AEPP1NTSCJ	David G. Marsee	"CAVEAT:As a first-time watcher, I can't compare the 2 English dubs. The 2006 release with Dakota Fanning seemed perfectly natural to me. I have no complaints, which I know is unpopular these days. Now with that out of the way...REVIEW:This is a wonderful, magical movie. My Neighbor Totoro (MNT) shows life in Japan in the 1950's from the perspective of 2 likable sisters, ages 10 and 4. Their Mother is in the hospital, and the whole family harbor silent fears that they'll lose her, so they show those fears in different ways. The portrayal of this family is believable, and multi-dimentional.The magical element to this film is added when forest spirits (soot sprites, Totoro and his family) are discovered by the girls. What amazed me the most about this movie is it's portrayal of magic: How 'un-Disney"" it is. There's no Pixie Dust, no chimes playing on the soundtrack, only a display of wonder or awe in the faces of Satsuki (the older sister) and Mei (the younger one) when they see something that's fantastical.In addidtion, the timing of the magic is: Few and Far Between. While that may seem like the scenes without magic would be boring, it only serves to heighten the girls' (and the audience's) wonder and excitment when magic does occur. It is similar in pace to Kiki's Delivery Service.I give this film my highest recommendation.NOTE:This movie is rated G, but American audiences will be surprised to see the family bathing (yes, nude) together. It's a completely innocuous scene, done with an eye to authenticity in Japanese family life in the 1950's."	5.0	A wonderful, magical, movie	2006-03-09	8	7	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AYJCBL4XU6TLW	David Grunwell	"I was at a store and saw My Neighbor Totoro on DVD and I flipped!  I have it on VHS and it is one of the most enjoyable, beautifully painted and almost meditative films I have ever seen.  Then, I was quite angry when I got Totoro home to find it is stupid full frame rather than letterboxed!  Trust me, you do not want to miss any of the backgrounds in any of Hayao Miyazaki's films.  This is why just 4 stars and not 5! This film is slow in pace, not for sugar-enhanced kids (or parents who need angry robots fighting in space.  This is like looking up at the trees and clouds from a hammock on a warm summer's day.  Tired of there being a lack of positive strong young girl characters in film?  Hayao Miyazaki seems to have a father's love of them.  When a film comes from Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki, it has nearly a 98% chance of being spectacular and wholly unique.  Each of his films has a warmth, passion and innocence that seems to be completely lost in films found in the US mainstream cinema.  Spirited Away or any other of Hayao Miyazaki's films, could never have been made in the US.  I can hear the Hollywood execs saying this about My Neighbor Totoro, ""Let me get this straight, two young girls meet a enormous friendly fuzzy ghost thingy with fangs and claws?  Then they get magic acorns and there is a bus that really is a cat with lots of legs?  Sounds like your client needs a twelve-step plan.  Here's where I went.""

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1BFTKKBHIR1BY	David G. Smith	I was raised on Disney, and I love Disney.  I also love Wizard of Oz.  These are the films that I began to show my two year old.  A little later  on he began to get very nasty all the time, it is what we called being a  wicked witch. Graciously into our life came the answer to bad guy role  models, this wonderful little film called My Neighbor Totoro.  I will defer  to other reviews that write profoundly about the history of the film, the  lovely plot and such...but I think I shall stick to how Totoro saved our  lives as parents.  My son now still refers to the film as the one with no  bad guys.  This is a film about nature, and the joys of being  children(for instance the children are always honored for their ideas and  their vision), the joys of discovery and moving.  The conflicts come from  real issues but are always sensitively done.  And it is fun, with a great  sense of fantasy.  AND OH MY GOODNESS, THAT CAT BUS! (just check out the  tail lights).  Totoro is a film that has achieved cult status for all the  right reasons, a stunningly sensitive and fun story that you can watch with  your kids without fear of them negatively acting out.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3URDROHMK4C7E	"David Kelts ""Sub Dude"""	I've got a dozen or so movie and educational videos for children in my collection.  My twin three year olds ask for this video most often.  They quote the characters and pretend to fly around the room clutching onto the Totoro's chest as Tsatsuki and Mei do.The plot does develop slowly, and they can get a little restless a half hour into it, but it is made up for by the charming, furry Totoro creature.  They are engrossed in the story once the Totoro enters the plot.I had read the plot review, which described two young girls moving to the country with their father, and thought thematically it would apply to me, a single father sharing equally and separately in raising my children.  The mother, however, is not absent but sick in the hospital waiting to return home.  I'm afraid I may have prolonged the hope of my children that their mother will return to my home.  This is probably not a concern for most people however.The animation is simply beautiful.  I don't mind watching this video with the kids because of the gorgeous scenery.  This is not another kids movie cranked out bya money-making studio.  You can tell that the work behind the movie was a labor of love and skill - all the more reason to buy the video.	5.0	&quot;Daddy, can we watch the Totoro video again?&quot;	2001-02-07	13	11	2
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3F7GX7BUTX3KG	David Michaelson	A favorite video of both adults and children I know. There is little action, but the story is charming and the animation extremely beautiful. All of Miyazaki's works are very high quality, putting American animation  to shame. Totoro is his most child-oriented story. It has a very different  pace and feeling than most children's animation these days, but still seems  to please children. I have given this video as a gift to three different  children and all of them loved it.	5.0	Charming and Beautiful	2000-01-22	5	5	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3SX8OM67HLGUM	David M. Mungenast	"Miyazaki's lyric film is a beautiful evocation of time gone by. Not so much in its depiction of a shimmering and placid Japanese countryside but in that it is a film that takes its time with its setting and its characters. Before you have finished you will feel that you know this place and the family that is at the center of this story. The film's feeling for nature and of the nature of human relationships is so sure that you will truly feel that you are a part of this scene whether or not you are Japanese.There is no great drama here, Just a family with a sick mother and two little girls. The slow unwinding of the story of their joys and sorrows is a beautiful evocation of the Japanese film makers who went before Miyazaki. When the delightuflly over the top Totoro and his cast of forest spirits arrive on the scene we do not hesitate for a minute to see them the manifestation of the transcendant nature that surrounds them. When the father and his daughters go to the giant camphor tree where Totoro lives and father asks the tree for its protection for his family we know that we have entered a different realm. But this realm is seperated from our own only by the thinest of tissues. The film is constantly, gently reminding of us of that transcendent world that exists just over the crest of our everday lives.That ""Totoro"" does all of this and has a good time in the process makes a real joy to watch. As the story winds down to its subtle and satisfying end, you will wish that it would go on forever and that you would never leave this place."	5.0	A lyric expression of a simpler time	2006-01-20	0	0	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3PI1EG10U6UZD	Davis M. Engel	The voices and sound effects are better than the modern Disney dub (those Fanning kids just make my ears bleed with their accents, it doesn't make sense!), and thus I recommend the 20th Century Fox english dub over the Disney one.  A side note, Totoro's voice was changed from the original Miyazaki film, but in my opinion it's better as it sounds more like a creature than just a guy moaning into a mic.Because the DVD lacks the extras, Japanese audio track and crisp film quality one would expect from an imported foreign film DVD, it loses a star and a half. ***1/2 of 5Of course, the film itself gets a 5 out of 5 ^_^	4.0	Better than the Disney dub, but missing some important stuff	2009-06-03	3	2	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3MAZM138KFVOW	D. Blackdeer	"Japanese animated feature about two young girls who meet a supernatural creature, or spirit, named ""Totoro.""  Director Miyazaki's talents shine in this movie with beautiful animation and simple pleasures.  The  story is set in the late 1950's when a college professor moves to the  country with his two daughters who are approximately five and eight years  of age.  The family is happy for the most part, but their mother is  confined to a hospital for an illness not identified in the story.  The  girls are enchanted with their new home, an old spacious house situated in  the country, surrounded by farms and forests.  Unusual events begin to take  place with mysterious little creatures running around the house and strange  winds and noises outside the house at night.  Eventually the girls discover  Totoro, a large mythical creature who looks like a cross between a bear and  rabbit; he's big!  Mei, the youngest of the two girls, meets him first and  she's the one who names him ""Totoro."" Satsuki, the older sister,  meets Totoro later in the film while waiting for her father at a lonely  bus-stop during an evening rainstorm, which is probably the most enjoyable  scene in the movie.  With Totoro are his two little brothers, miniature  versions of himself, and a giant cat who looks like a bus.  Totoro and the  giant Catbus come to the rescue when Mei is lost in the country after  running off in anguish to look for her mother at the hospital, and Satsuki  is in dispair trying to find her sister.  The story is simple and it's enchanting."	5.0	Very Nice Story and Beautiful Animation	2000-01-22	25	23	2

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1RM549OCJA2FT	D. Dunlosky	Every good thing you've read in these reviews is correct. This is an absolute feast for the eyes and imagination.... however.... this edition is not widescreen, it's pan &amp; scan (full screen), so you'll miss some of this animator's breathtaking scenery and composition.Miyazaki's artistry is such that he uses every single inch of space on a screen, and for me, to watch it in pan &amp; scan is to insult his work. Unfortunately there is no &quot;complete&quot; version of the film available here yet, although Disney is supposed to be releasing one when FOX's rights to the film have expired. All the other available works by Miyazaki are done beautifully in the United States. It's a travesty that this &quot;signature&quot; film of his is still only available in this &quot;somewhat less than whole&quot; version.So buy this and watch it, but only if you promise yourself to re-buy it when the whole film becomes available. I've seen this picture many, many times (I'm 45 years old - so it really is for kids of all ages) and it has something new for me every time I see it.  Plus, I've seen it both wide-screen AND pan &amp; scan (full screen) and I can tell you that the difference is worth seeking out (it's available wide from Japan and China if you own an all-region DVD player) or waiting until it comes out properly here.WIDESCREEN - 5 starsFull Screen  - 4 (maybe 3.5) stars	4.0	Incredible movie - but something's missing (the fifth star!)	2004-06-15	8	8	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	"Hayao Miyazaki, the most prominent Japanese filmmaker who has created animated films that not only broke Japanese box office records but has created animated films that reflect upon nature, technology, family and more.  Compared to the accomplishments of Walt Disney, Miyazaki is a filmmaker who has amassed a respect from his fans worldwide and his animations studio, Studio Ghibli, continues to be one of the most appreciated and respected animation and production studios in the world.In 1988, wrote and directed the animated classic ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (Tonari no Totoro) which won the Animage Grand Prix Award in 1988 and was brought over to the United States from Fox Video/Streamline on VHS in the '90s and on DVD in 2002.  When their rights expired, Disney picked up the rights to the many of the Studio Ghibli films and redubbed the film featuring major Hollywood talent and re-released the film on DVD in 2006 but this time with both an English and Japanese audio track.Here we are in 2010 and with Miyazaki's latest film ""Ponyo"" being released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 2nd, Disney will also re-release Studio Ghibli classics such as ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Castle in the Sky"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro"" special editions on DVD.VIDEO & AUDIO:""My Neighbor Totoro"" is just an amazing animated film which I first watched back in 1993 (in Japanese, no subtitles) and at the time, although I didn't know what was going on, I was simply in awe with the animation.  Of how beautiful the artistic backgrounds were.  The village and its lush green, to the painted detail on the trunk of the trees to even the ground during rainy weather, I was impressed. Now, the film is 22-years-old and watching it again, the film still holds up remarkably well today.The film is presented in widescreen (1:85:1) - enhanced for 169 televisions.  Colors are vibrant and one can only hope that Disney releases the film via HD on Blu-ray.As for the audio, audio is clear and understandable.  The film is presented in English Dolby Digital Sound and also includes the Japanese and French language tracks.  It's important to note that fans of the film have heard two different English dubs of ""My Neighbor Totoro"", the FOX Streamline dub and the current Disney dub.  Both are well-done but the difference is that in the Fox dub, the characters of Mei and even Kanta sound much older.  While in the Disney dub, Kanta sounds a bit more younger.  It's a matter of preference as both English dubs are done very well but its important to note that the Fox/Streamline version is out of print long ago and the DVD never came with the Japanese track or special features.  Nevertheless, for those new to ""My Neighbor Totoro"", I'm sure they will enjoy the voice acting by the Fanning sisters.Subtitles are in English and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""My Neighbor Totoro"" comes with the following special features on a second DVD disc.  Included are:* Original Japanese Storyboards - (1:26:16) - Watch the entire film but this time with the video showcasing the original storyboards.* Creating My Neighbor Totoro - (2:59) Hayao Miyazaki talks about how he came up with the concept of ""My Neighbor Totoro"".* Creating the Characters - (4:22) Producer Toshio Suzuki talks about the characters of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and how ""E.T. was an influence.* The Totoro Experiencing - (2:00) Producer Toshio Suzuki talks about how the film didn't do well in the box office but when it aired on television, it did remarkably well.* Producer's Perspective: Creating Ghibli - (1:22) Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki talks about how the named ""Ghibli"" came about.* The Locations of Totoro - (28:34) An excerpt from a Japanese documentary on ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and visiting the areas that inspired Miyazaki to create the village of Totoro.* Scoring Miyazaki - (7:17) A featurette about Joe Hisaishi's scoring Miyazaki films and more.* Original Japanese Trailer - (1:50) The original Japanese theatrical trailer.* Behind the Microphone - (5:41) Featuring the English dub voice talents talking about their role, their appreciation for Miyazaki and his films.  Also, behind-the-scenes of the talent recording their voices.* Ponyo - Creating Ponyo - (3:56) Hayao Miyazaki talks about the creation of ""Ponyo"" and wanting to create a film for young children.* Kiki's Delivery Service - Creating Kiki's Delivery Service -  (2:27) Hayao Miyazaki discussing the creation of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and what inspired Miyazaki for the creation of the city in the film.* Castle in the Sky: Character Sketches - (2:37) Miyazaki talks about the characters of ""Castle in the Sky"" and discussing how his audiences are loyal to his films over time.* Enter the Lands - Visit the land featuring various small animated Studio Ghibli characters (from all films).  Click on a character from that film (note: only ""Ponyo"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Castle in the Sky"" are available) to get a Q&A; or a small video info. of that film and its characters.EXTRAS:Also, included is a postcard featuring Satsuki and Totoro at the bus stop.JUDGMENT CALL:I absolutely love ""My Neighbor Totoro"".  From when I first saw it in Japanese (which I didn't understand at the time) at a Japanese animation club screening back in 1993 and now watching it over 15-years-later and watching it alongside with my son.  There is this captivating quality with Miyazaki's characters, his enjoyable to sometimes serious screenplays and Studio Ghibli always delivering when it comes to quality.And when you consider how a lot of animated films today are 100% CG animated, when you see a Miyazaki film, you know that he doesn't follow the mainstream.  He makes the kind of films that he wants and for the most part, every film that I have seen from Studio Ghibli, I've been more than satisfied.I remember watching ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and enjoying the lively moments from the beginning but having seen his animated films ""Nausicaa"", ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" and even ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", as his films are happy and humorous, by the final half of the film, the story definitely shifts to a serious tone and in this film, it does get a bit serious when both Satsuki and Mei facing the probability of their mother dying in the hospital.  These are genuine emotions that these two young girls feel but at the same time, what transpires afterward was captivating and how the film ends, Miyazaki definitely knows how to wrap up a film and make you feel content and satisfied with overall story.""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a wonderful family film and by no means is it scary.  For the parents, this film is among the more lighter-toned Miyazaki films out there.  Miyazaki has mentioned in interviews that he created ""My Neighbor Totoro"" for the children while his latest film ""Ponyo"" was more of him wanting to create a film for even younger children.  But for the most part, if you want to introduce a Miyazaki film to your children, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a great place to start.But the big question for many people is if ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is worth the investment, especially if you own the 2002 and 2006 DVD releases.  If you own the 2006 Disney DVD, there are a large number of special features on this 2010 release that are not included in the 2006 DVD but if you are not into special features, then its probably not worth buying it again.  But for those who have never owned the DVD, let alone only have that old Fox/Streamline VHS or DVD, then yes its definitely worth it!  I know there are some fans who prefer the original dub from the old Fox/Streamline years but that release was pretty much barebones.  Yes, I still have my old copy of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and I did enjoy the original dub a lot but personally, with this newer release, you get the Japanese audio track and plenty of special features that were not included in the 2006 DVD release as well.Overall, this 2010 ""My Neighbor Totoro"" DVD release is fantastic.  A great film with a lot of new bonus content.  Highly recommended!"	5.0	2010 DVD Release:  A magnificent Hayao Miyazaki film with gorgeous animation and painted backgrounds and an enjoyable film for t	2010-03-10	20	19	1

The first time I put it in I almost cried. It just wasn't as funny or entertaining. After doing some research I found the Fox version here on Amazon, purchased it, and gifted the Disney version.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2FEJIORC1MBG3	D. Hartley	"The rather tardy ""deluxe"" DVD release of Japanese animation master Miyazaki's first big hit proves to be a mixed blessing of sorts. On the one hand, it's great to finally have a version with the original Japanese soundtrack, and in widescreen (I think that is the main thing that cinephiles/serious anime collectors have been salivating for). However, Disney decided to record an entirely new voice-over session for the English dub track, which is, as other reviewers have astutely observed, a somewhat pointless excercise. Perhaps the company thought they could move even more units if they had the name of a current child actor du jour (Dakota Fanning) on the jacket? It is also annoying that in order to obtain the widescreen Japanese version, you're forced to pay a steep price because this little 90 minute gem has now been bloated into a ""deluxe"" 2-disc set. Personally, I find the ""making of"" documentaries on all the Disney Miyazaki releases to be fairly interchangable (With an artist like Miyazaki, I don't necessarily NEED to know how the man behind the mirror makes the magic-I just want to experience it.) As for the film itself-as you can glean from all the glowing reviews on this site, it's a winner. I've always felt ""My Neighbor Totoro"" to be Miyazaki's most simplistic piece (I'm talking storyline, not animation quality, which is stunning as always) but perhaps that explains why it remains his most  universally popular ""family"" film. Most of the patented Miyazaki themes are present (young female protagonist, respecting nature, white magic, the ability to fly), but it plays now like a ""Cliff's Notes"" blueprint for the more mature and complex work that was to follow. Still, this one is not to be missed!"	4.0	Love the cat bus, but I'd hate to be the mechanic	2006-03-08	9	8	1

Example-- original  ""Don't forget to say good-bye!"" as tatsuki rushes off to school.

If I'm at the cinema I'd prefer subtitles, but when I'm at home and have other things fighting for my attention, watching the dubbed one doesn't seem like that bad an idea.The Japanese DVD has the 1980s Streamline dub on it, which I thought was very good. So when I bought the American DVD (which has far better picture quality), I was expecting the worst of the new dub. After wincing at the newly dubbed song at the start, I actually said, ""Wow, this is ten times better"". And it stayed that way throughout the film.I honestly don't know what some people hate so much about this dub, I think it's great. Little details of the story seem to make more sense now than they did before. So go in with an open mind, I personally think Disney did a great job on this one."	5.0	What's wrong with the new dub?	2006-03-19	9	7	2

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1XX5797TIZT5Q	D. Mok	Though Miyazaki Hayao is known as one of the classiest animation creators in Japan, Totoro isn't a very good representation of his work.Perhaps he is too fond of this story, which is a blend of his childhood memories and  Japanese folklore.  The resultant movie is long, cutesy, not very  accessible to grown-ups (if charming) -- too much time devoted to too  little material.The story is human and heartwarming:  Writer retires to  the country with two little daughters, with his wife in the hospital.  The  problem is, Miyazaki hasn't given his characters enough to do, so all we're  left with is the cuteness, which wears off after about 15 minutes and isn't  salvaged until the late entrance of the titular character.Characters,  actually.  The two &quot;Mini-Totoros&quot; are hilarious, and when the  gigantic patriarch spirit appears, in a half-asleep state, no less, it  makes for great comedy.  Unfortunately, not enough actions have been built  into the rising action after this key encounter.  The crisis -- the  possible deterioration of Mom's health -- is worthy enough.  But with  scenes such as the discovery of the shoe, the sense of dread that should  have prevailed is set aside to prefer sentimental touches like the old  woman and the villagers' melodramatic response.Good concept; weak  plotting and shaky technique.  Still much better than the formulaic Disney  musicals that reign over American animation.  Wonderful score, as well, by  one of film music's unheralded masters, Joe Hisaishi.  I highly recommend  that music and film lovers alike explore his other work for Miyazaki --  most notably Laputa:  Castle in the Sky and Nausica&auml;:  Warriors of the  Wind.	3.0	Too much sentimentality; snail-like pace.	1999-01-24	9	3	6
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A30AGM4ARFLGFH	"Doc Doom ""Vic"""	This movie can make me feel better no matter what the status of my life. In fact, most times it not only makes me feel better, it usually brings tears of joy to my eyes. It's a remarkable film and my favorite of Miyazaki's works and that is saying more than anything else I might.The plot is relatively simple. Two young girls, Mei (4) and Satsuki (10) movie into a new house with their father. The house seems to be swarming with spirits of the &quot;Dustbunnies&quot; and the like. However, Mei finds herself a new friend in the cuddliest spirit of them all, the King of the Forest, Totoro. Totoro is an endearing creature, resembling a largish bear-bunny hybrid, and he befriends the girls and helps them with various things.That being said, some people complain about the DVD's lack of features. Indeed, it is a tragedy that we're not privy to the savory Japanese release, something I was fervently awaiting myself, but it's not as if we're being robbed. It's a ten-dollar DVD! The same price as the VHS and it lasts longer and I've yet to hear of a problem with this edition of the DVD (as with the Neon Genesis movie).Disney really takes the films for granted (almost refusing to release the amazing &quot;Spirited Away&quot; for a time), but the fans with wear them down I believe and we'll see a special edition soon. Need proof? Disney was forced to push back the release of &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; to DVD because there was an outcry against them for not including the Japanese language track. Take THAT Disney!In closing, the only other thing I can offer is this: more often than not, I'm watching this without the audience of my younger siblings. Actually, they've only seen it once. I keep the treasure mostly to myself. Although I might enlist them to help me with a tree-grow dance this spring...	5.0	The Most Beautiful Film in Existence	2002-12-07	14	11	3

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A21JSZ93WD1KPR	donmusic	This film is one of my personal favorites. It is far above being an average kids movie. It is wonderful as a children's movie; it is a charming and clever work of art enjoyed by adults as well. It is also a favorite among the many fans of its creator, Academy Award winner Hayao Miyazaki.Such a shame, then, to see the DVD presented so poorly, in TV aspect ratio and in English only. The Region 2 version of this DVD is much nicer, offering widescreen format, multiple language selections, subtitles, and extras including a map to the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo. Why, then, must we in Region 1 settle for such a lazy, lousy package? Why bother with the DVD? This is like having a videocassette.If you just want something to pop in to keep the young kids out of trouble, you can't go wrong with this fascinating, magical yarn. If you are a film lover, DVD collector, or if you are looking to pad your experiences with the art of Hayao Miyazaki, I reccomend considering the fact that there are alternatives to this poor treatment, such as the Region 2 version.	2.0	Poor packaging of a wonderful film	2003-11-24	7	7	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A11C43I615R52G	"Don Vito Corleone ""The Joker"""	As being usual with the master animator, My Neighbor Totoro is another masterpiece from Miyazaki. The film set in Japan is beautifully animated by traditional methods (hand-drawn) with glorious detail in every frame. The story is a simple one but will captivate the hearts of children and adults everywhere. Is refreshing to see an animated film that does not rely on action sequences, explosions and a constant feeling of peril. Instead, this film fluently make you discover other things calmly without making you jump in every scene. Joe Hisaishi's score is an excellent companion to the visuals. Is a film for all ages.This new edition DVD does not dissapoint. Video is clear and strong, only fine grain appears in some scenes. The 2.0 dolby sound is nothing spectacular but it is clear and crisp. Supplements are really good. Aside from the storyboard version of the film, you got other featurettes about the movie. They are short but entertaining nontheless. The movie is in anamorphic widescreen (really nice). You can watch the film in english, french or the original Japanese. Personally I prefer the Japanese track because it feels more natural and fluent. English and french subtitles are also provided.My Neighbor Totoro is one of the best animated films ever. You should buy it whether you have family or not. Every animation or DVd collection should have it. Totally recommended.	5.0	Excellent Miyazaki Film!!!	2010-05-26	1	1	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1W5GH4UFHGL4I	Dr Mummy	The original English dub of this wonderful film is so far superior to the Disney dub.  Dakota Fanning and her sister may be cute in other films but here, their voices are not suited to the characters. The singer gets the songs wrong (who let that happen?), the Japanese-ness of the film is missing--it's lost the charm, the warmth, the love of the original dub.  Disney should not have touched this. We bought it, we started to watch it and then we turned it off.  I don't expect to watch it again and will probably sell it.I would have given this film 1 star for what Disney did to it--the film as Miyzaki wrote it is a 5+.

It gets high marks from people who haven't seen the Fox dub.  It is lambasted by those who have.  So if you haven't seen the Fox version, you will probably be fine with the Disney dub.  Unfortunately I have the Fox version and think that it is a masterpiece. I only wish there was a widescreen version of that dub.Now, down to business: Why create a two disc version of a DVD when the movie and extras can fit on one disc? Di$ney a cra$$ corporation looking to make some buck$? No! Never. Say it ain't so!I give this 2 stars simply because it is Miyazaki, and his films in the Western world should be preserved on DVD, even with poor dubbing and pitiful extras.  The one good thing about it is that it's widescreen and in the extras; the storyboards. But the really laughable feature is a behind the scenes of American actors who can't dub to the animation which is awful to say the least.Though it is not widescreen, I suggest that if you are looking for a nice DVD version with a DELIGHTFUL English dub, hunt down the out of print FOX DVD. A good English dub of Japanese anime is absolutely RARE and this is one of the few shining examples of a perfect dub.As for interpritations of ""Susuwatari"" within the story, I can't bear the idea of the girls yelling ""soot gremlins"".  ""Dust bunnies"" is waaaay cuter and fits much better within the confines of the story.  THAT is one of the elements that makes the Fox dub so enduring, they understood what CUTE was in relation to a very cute and sweet movie."	2.0	Ham handed Disney dub and sparse extras	2006-03-06	3	0	3
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1TJIJKKN15KR9	drqshadow	A gorgeous, pitch-perfect example of Studio Ghibli's wonderful trademarked style. Bubbling over with awe, wonder, curiosity and optimism, it's downright impossible not to get sucked into viewing and enjoying this through the eyes of its two young protagonists, recognizing forgotten flashes of our own youth at several steps along the way. The plot isn't particularly deep or elaborate, but in many ways I can see that as a positive - why force drama into a scenario that's working perfectly well as a quiet, leisurely stroll down imagination lane? I was actually relieved when it became clear they weren't even thinking of moving in that direction. Even the more reflective moments don't miss a beat, as Miyazaki and company lovingly flush the screen with life in dozens of cheery, unexpected ways. Magnificent animation pairs with a breathtaking setting, a playful spirit, a lovable cast of characters, great timing and a moderate dash of real-life tangibility. Authentic and vivid and pleasant, with at least one foot planted firmly in our world... despite the constant presence of an eight-foot Furby.	5.0	Passionate and Playful, it's Pure Miyazaki Goodness	2013-07-29	2	2	0

Although my fearless 2yr-old will watch 'Spirited Away' with no qualms, 'My Neighbour Totoro' provides a similar magical adventure without the scary creatures.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"Nobody captures the magic of childhood and bottles it into movie form quite like Hayao Miyazaki -- and one steller example of this is ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" an enchanting little film about two little girls who encounter strange, wondrous things in the woods. There's not much actual plot, but the journey is the truly lovely part, and the lush animation and weird creatures (catbus! CATBUS!) finish off the perfection.Satsuki and her toddler sister Mei move to the countryside with their father, so they can be close to the hospital where their mother is being treated (apparently for tuberculosis). The girls are immediately taken under the wing of an old lady, and discover that the countryside is filled with strange and magical creatures -- especially little balls of soot that dance through uncleaned rooms in their house.What's more, while waiting for a bus Satsuki ends up standing next to a giant grinning bunny-creature -- whom Mei learns is called Totoro -- who boards a giant leaping cat-bus. The girls soon befriend the trio of Totoro, who take them on magical adventures involving giant fast-growing trees, flying with umbrellas, and riding in the cat-bus. But after the girls learn that their mother has become ill and can't visit, Mei vanishes without a trace -- and Satsuki may need Totoro's help to find her.""My Neighbor Totoro"" is sort of a fantasy slice-of-life story -- it's basically a few days in the life of two chipper little girls, who happen to be living in a Japanese countryside filled with genial spirits and magical happenings. There's no real plot at the center of it, but such is Miyazaki's skill that you never really care. You just want to see if things will turn out all right in the short term, and revel in the innocence of being little kids in the countryside.To that end, Miyazaki spins up a magical little world -- houses are filled with bug-eyed sootballs, a tunnel in the bushes may lead to a Totoro's lair, and a vegetable garden can sprout into a vast towering tree. It's all painted in lush, vibrant colors and great detail, and Miyazaki does a good job emphasizing the little moments of everyday life (Mei showing up at Satsuki's school) and interweaving them with the more fantastical stuff (Totoro flying across windswept fields with an umbrella).But he never forgets that real life has its bumps in the road -- there's a genuinely touching subplot in which the girls hear that their mother is ill again, and there's a genuine sense of fear. It's not too harsh (it's a kid's movie, after all), but it taps into a very primal fear that every little kid has.The characters are all rather simple, but they're still quite likable, with upbeat personalities and loud laughter. Satsuki is particular is a realistic kid, staying positive most of the time but occasionally blowing up at Mei or crying out of fear that her mother will die. The only character I didn't understand was the boy in the cap, who seems troubled and shy, but who is never fully explored.This movie has always gotten skimped somewhat on the extras, so it's nice to see that it's finally getting some attention -- it has the Disney dub (which is quite good) and original Japanese dub, storyboards, behind-the-scenes featurette, and a pair of interactive features called ""World of Ghibli"" and ""Enter the Lands"".While it's more obviously aimed at kids than many of Miyazaki's movies, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is an enchanting little story with a warm heart, and Hayao Miyazaki perfectly captures the innocence of childhood. Plus, it has a big, furry, grinning bus."	5.0	Spirits of the forest	2010-01-10	4	4	0

It's widescreen presentations was flawless and full of color. It also had a number of extras on this dvd.Next debate, the new dub. Ok, I completely understand why people dont like this dub...i dont like it as well as the Fox Totoro dub either. Before this was out all anyone could do is complain about the acting on the Fox Totoro, now everyone prefers it.I watched My neighbor Totoro when i was young. It was my favorite movie. We only rented it though. Then years later (about a year or two ago). I found the Fox version in a walmart bargain bin of dvds. I couldnt believe my eyes, memories rushed back as i grabbed it and bought it. I really loved watching it.Then a few years later this one comes out. Disney does a great job at these Ghibli movies. So i did not hesitate to buy the movie again. Not only is it widescreen, but it has the original japanese version. I am not big on Japanese versions, but its always nice to run through once.First thing i thought...They redid the song. Same words new vocals. It was nice. then Wow they sound older than they look...I know Dakota Fanning is a great young actress, but she sounded older than the previous one who played her. I also noticed a lot of dialouge changes. I dont know anything about japanese so i dont know which was more accurate. But it kinda made me feel bad...They arent soot gremlins they  are dust bunnies. I have known them as dust bunnies all my life, then they change it to soot gremlins.........that makes me sick......Even when i first saw spirited away i said ""Look its the dust bunnies"". Course they called them soot sprites...which still sounds better than soot gremlins. That is the only real thing i hated about this movie.I picked up my fox dvd for only $5.50 at wal mart. This one for $20 at wal mart. Both i love, disney for the quality, and Fox for the original dialogue and voices i have grown to love.I still give this 5 stars despite the soot gremlin horror.If the dub bugs you that much. I would buy the fox version. What i do, is since i have a ps2 and a dvd player. I put one in each, wire the disney video, and the fox sound together with the cables and then start them at the same time. That way i get my favorite dialogue and good video."	5.0	Great animated movie	2006-07-26	10	9	1
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AYFINB2KY3Z67	Eduardo C. Dayao	Hayao Miyazaki's &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; may be a bit of anthropomorphic whimsy but never be leery of its G rating. Far from &quot;Ferngully&quot;-style fluff, it stokes that delicate chemistry that  happens when the fantastic rubs up against the mundane and can get as rich,  as haunting, as folklore.  Isolated from their hospitalised mother and  billeted in a house in the country, two sisters, Satsuki and Mei, stumble  upon the treetrunk dwellings of three Totoros, or forest spirits, who take  them on a breath-snatching night flight and leaves them with a sense of  enchantment to offset their melancholy. Low-key, intimate, open-ended even,  more  like a European movie than a Disney cartoon, &quot;Totoro&quot; never  lets the supernatural overwhelm the natural, illuminating even the most  humdrum trifles with a quiet magic. Its glimpses of the real are as  entrancing as its detours into the fantastic. Miyazaki understands that  childhood is a lithe, fanciful terrain haunted by wisps of mystery and  foreboding . Like in his other work (&quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot;,  &quot;Nausicaa&quot;) , &quot;Totoro&quot; refers to this prepubescent  sense of wonder for surplus. Restoring spark and vigor to a tired medium,  &quot;My neighbor Totoro&quot; is an arcane delight: an ageless movie for  all ages.	4.0	Natural Wonder	1999-05-01	3	3	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2FIWUMDNSBSWL	"E. Hillman ""part of a balanced breakfast"""	As you've probably already figured out from other reviews, there's a serious problem here...  Fox has taken what is probably not just a great animated film, but one of the best films ever to come out of Japan, and has given it a US DVD release that is nothing short of a kick in the teeth to fans of the movie.A quick glance at the back of the box will tell you pretty much everything that's wrong here.  &quot;Interactive Menus&quot; are NOT a special feature.  Neither is &quot;Full-Screen Presentation&quot;.  Certainly the complete absence of language options isn't a feature, although I'm almost surprised they didn't try to pass it off as one.That having been said, everything about the movie itself is very, very right.  The animation is beautiful, rich and detailed, and the story is simple enough for kids to understand, yet deep enough to reward multiple viewings.  Although I'm sure some would disagree, I think the English dubbing is actually very well done, and as far as I know, the movie is, frame-for-frame, identical to the Japanese version -- although that's probably not so much a testament to Fox's wisdom as to their sheer apathy.If you're a true &quot;otaku&quot;, it might be worth your time and money to hunt down a region-free subtitled edition (I'm given to understand Buena Vista actually distributes one in Japan).  But if you're just looking for a movie you can share with your kids that won't insult your own intelligence, look no further.

I always liked the movie, and reading the reviews here made me curious enough to buy the full-screen DVD. The first thing I noticed was how much of the original film was cut from the VHS tape- I had always thought of the story as being a little vague and with a very sketchy plot- for instance, the father was nearly nonexistent in my old version, and appeared distant and uninvolved when he was in the movie, which turned out not to be the case at all. The true beauty of the film unfolded and for the first time I saw why My Neighbor Totoro is such a well-loved classic! The original Japanese soundtrack, with the inflections and cute little voices of the children (especially Mei's) really add to the film, even though I don't speak Japanese- the inflections are so much more genuine, and the subtitles are very easy to follow. I plan to get my hands on more Studio Ghibli films right away. If you've only seen the full-screen, dubbed version of this movie, you owe it to yourself to watch the original, subtitled version.	5.0	An enormous difference between version!	2006-08-17	10	10	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A29TKSIWA3JKF3	Einsatz	"This is an oddly personal film, at times it feels like we're invading the privacy of this family through their home movies.  They've just moved into a new house and we're allowed to watch the exuberance of two sisters as they explore the place with giddy anticipation of what they might find.  It's a simple story, merry and infectious, where even the discovery of tadpoles is wondrous.  The artwork is fabulous.  The characters are a marvel; I especially liked the little boy of few words who loans the sisters an umbrella that's full of holes...............during a rainstorm.  I believe that's called a mixed blessing.My mistake was watching the English version with the English subtitles.  As always, the spoken and written words didn't match.  It may have given me a little more insight into the story but hearing Tim Daly's voice coming from the father of the girls was more than a little distracting.  I've always believed that voice work should go to actors willing to create a voice suited to a character.  A ""famous"" voice is always jarring because it calls to mind that actor and not the character you're watching.  Next time I view this movie it will be with the Japanese tracks and English subtitles.  Other than that small quibble, my only other complaint is the lack of information concerning the mother's health.  It's only through the bonus features that we learn this film takes place during the 1950s when tuberculosis outbreaks were still prevalent.  Knowing this might have helped ease the worry that, like most Disney films, they were about to kill off a parent!  I hate that.  Otherwise, this is a thoroughly charming film.  Totoro is a delight, a little scary when he smiles and roars, but still a delight.  I'm happy to include this movie in my collection."	5.0	"""I caught one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""	2013-01-27	0	0	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1Q253FVZZ1FH5	E. J.	My Neighbor Totoro is one of the films that if you haven't been exposed to quality animation will quickly become your favorite and stay in your mind forever. First, the story. A Japanese family is moving to a rural area and dealing with their mother's illness. Little Mei and Satsuke have a lot of fun at the new location as they chase susuwatari (dust bunnies), make friends with an elderly lady, a young boy, and as they encounter mysterious fantastical creatures - a large bear-like animal and his little friends, Totoro. Little Mei misses her mom and embarks on a solo journey into the city, scaring to death her family and friends. They enroll Totoro, the kitty bus, and the friendly villagers to try to find her.There is a scene particular to the Japanese culture that may be surprising to the Western eye when dad bathes with his two little daughters. It is done tastefully and is a natural part of the story.The animation is breath-taking even though movie is decades old. The music is beautiful. This is a gem in the field of animation and of movies in general. The movie feels very authentic and some might say anti-Disney in that the characters are deep and the motives are pure. The anti-Disney tag is not entirely fair to some Disney movies but might convey the basic approach.Highly recommended.	5.0	A beautiful film	2012-02-07	2	2	0

No emotion whatsoever. At least the girl in this actually has emotion when she does the voices. Disney also changed some of the words. Plus, I can't stand the way they changed Kanta's voice. He sounds like a little girl. This is the original one I grew up with and I like this dub the best. Disney did a great job of cleaning up the art and making the music more clear, but I enjoy this version the best.	5.0	Better than Disney...	2011-01-01	4	3	1

But the best part of the movie is the relationship between the two sisters.  It is a real sister relationship, without the contrived fights or the saccharine relationships that seem to be a part of so many other portrayals of sisters in movies.  The sisters love each other, care for each other, and take care of each other.  My two daughters very much love seeing this aspect of the movie.	5.0	Wonderful sister story	2011-11-12	0	0	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AA7W0CFRXF46L	elfdart	the first maybe 15/ 20 minutes of this movie are really annoying and just seem like these two girls are running around trying to be cute and carefree. those few minutes made me acutely aware that i was an adult watching a child's movie, in the most unpleasant way possible. thankfully it improves. in fact, if you play the movie again right after you've seen it once, you'll most likely still have the happy/ magical feeling and will still feel a connection to the characters, so can pass of the annoying as...... endearing.the girls take us on a journey, seeing the world through their eyes. the story begins when the girls and their father move to a new house in the country. when they get there they start bumping into spirits, and continue to do so throughout the movie. the story itself is a very plain story about two girls living their regular lives, waiting for their mother to come home from the hospital, but this magical world that only the girls can interact with and see takes the story to a whole other level. the magical beings the girls interact with can easily be rationalized as the imaginations of these two girls as they make more of their surroundings than is actually there (for example the soot gremlins could be just dust balls), but even if that is the case, it makes the story that much more fantastic. a child, who is already prone to accepting the fact that magic can exist, will accept this story as it is presented, two girls who meet forest spirits. an adult however, much more skeptical than a child, may not do so and will look for instances to rationalize away the magic (soot gremlins = dust balls), and to that adult this story has the wonderful lesson of seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary. that's also why it helps to watch the movie twice as an adult to enjoy it, you get over your inhibitions and desire to make it fit into your own life after seeing it the first time, for those who don't need the first time i salute you.it's a wonderful movie, and as it's a myazaki film, definitely worth the watch.	5.0	magical tale of discovery	2008-04-30	0	0	0

We loved it, and even though we've seen it about a million times I have yet to feel like I have watched it too much. I love just about everything Studio Ghibli has put out. I am very happy that I have the old Fox version. It will continue to be the version watched in my home since it has the dignity that I believe the original My Neighbor Totoro has. Put more bluntly, you'll get the Fox version from my cold dead hands.This Disney dub is very disappointing.The first thing that I've noticed is how much of the reverence for nature has been stripped out. It's lost most of the magical beauty that was in it. The Fox version may not be as visually stunning, but the translation is so much better, as is the voice acting. This dub took me back to the bad old days of dubs when the lip movement did not even come close to the voice over. It's also been very Americanized. One example would be when Mei finds the bottomless bucket and calls it ""stupid"", as if it were now useless. In the Fox version she simply says ""It has no bottom!"" in wonder. Children can find so many different uses for things most adults can not. It's part of the wonder of childhood, and that wonder is normally very well expressed in Studio Ghibli films. In hearing the translation differences between the Fox version and the Disney version I wonder how badly mangled other Disney dubbed versions of Ghibli movies are.My daughter pointed out each and every time when something was different. In our family we have used the illustration of when Satsuki calls Mei ""stupid"" for why we never should call people stupid. In the Disney version, that lesson is totally gone. The Disney version also dumbs down the English vocabulary. In the Fox version the word ""pollywogs"" is used rather than ""tadpoles"" in the water. It's an old term for tadpoles and I was just plain ecstatic about the ""big words"". I love in Kiki's Delivery Service that the word ""dirigible"" was used rather than ""blimp"". Neither of these words are too hard for children to learn or say. My daughter was two when we first viewed each of those films and saying both words and knew what they meant! If you asked her if she wanted to see a tadpole she'd look at you blankly, but ask her if she wanted to see a pollywog she would light up!The ""special features"" on the Disney DVD don't make up the cost of this film. The features amount to one whole DVD with the original story boards set to the *new* dubbing, a ""behind the scenes"" of the recording of the Disney dubbing, and an un-restored trailer for the movie.

Since it has been a favorite animated movie of mine and we spent a long time finding it on VHS at the time and then rented it recently on DVD.  I purchased this Special Edition DVD when I bought Ponyo (another great movie).I watched this DVD the other day and something felt off right away.  I finally grabbed the case and saw that the voice actors are not the same as the ones I was used to in the prior versions of the film.  They also changed certain words and things that made it feel odd.  It felt like the entire movie had been turned down in volume and the voices just didn't fit the movie.  I was very disappointed and will now have to buy a used version with the classic voices.

That said, I do have a few things to say concerning the Disney version (and watching it in Japanese with English subtitles).Pros:1. I commend Disney for NOT adding extra dialog during the many quiet moments.  As someone said, Miyazaki films (and many Japanese animations in general) make good use of quiet moments, and they should not be ruined with dialog that's not supposed to be there.  (I hope the dub doesn't add dialog either.)  And I like that the sound effects (like laughing) aren't needlessly translated.Cons:1. This first is the greatest ""Con.""  During the opening and closing songs, there's no English subtitles for the song lyrics.  Instead, there's only a translation of the credits.  Why???  We're missing two very nice songs that help introduce the movie and gives a nice summary of Totoro.  In comparison, who cares about the credits?  Does the special feature ""Opening and closing animation without credits"" include English subtitles for the song lyrics?  You'd hope so, but they don't!  Even when you turn the subtitles on, it doesn't display anything... even though there are no credits to translate.  Of my 3 complaints, this is the worst one, because it takes away from the intro and denoument.  Some of the ""magic"" is lost.2. The ""anamorphic widescreen"" is cropped on the sides and a little on the bottom.  I have a Chinese (or Japanese?) version that has a fuller picture.  Even though I haven't watched that version in over a year, when I watched the new Disney version for the first time, I could already tell it was missing some of the picture.  The image seemed claustrophobic.3. This one's more a matter of personal preference, but the subtitles cover up the beautiful animation.  In some scenes, the subtitles cover up the main characters, obscuring the ""action.""  Granted, this may be intended for those with widescreen TV's, but I prefer them in the bottom black bar.  I can move the subtitles lower using my DVD player, but I can't on my laptop.I really love this movie.  It's a great film with great imagery and characteres.  I'd give the film 5 stars, but the DVD I can only give a 3.  So the average is a 4.Why can't Disney or someone put out a version that doesn't mess with the content?

I will never understand why Disney has to take any film from Studio Chiba and give it horrible english dubbing. Are people that too lazy to read subtitles? I am by no means a diehard anime fan but I know that dubbing a Japanese film sounds atrocious. Case in point all of Hiyao Miyazaki's films.""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a delightful film that even this adult loves. Satsuki and her younger sister Mei temporarily moves to the countryside with their father to be closer to the hospital where their mother is. The film doesn't say what befell their mother. I just know that she is seriously ill enough to be staying in the hospital for more than a few days. At their new home, Satsuki and Mei discover a world and its inhabitants that only children can see. One of the inhabitants is Totoro, what looks like an enormously fat cat. Totoro only appears to children when he wants to appear.I loved ""My Neighbor Totoro"". The young characters were never cloyingly, unrealistically sweet nor did they see each other as adversaries. Satsuki was mature yet very sensititve, Mei was precocious yet overly rambunctious. The sisters did truly care for each other and looked out for each other as any siblings would in real life. I watched the Japanese version because when Disney massacres Miyazaki's films with english actors, the magic of the film is lost. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a fun, light hearted film. It may not have that serious, epic feel of Miyazaki's films like ""Spirited Away"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" but it is just as engaging to watch."	5.0	Cute film	2006-04-01	1	1	0

The voice actors seemed a little too earnest. Let's just say I thought it lacked subtlety, but in what is basically a children's movie, this is quite forgivable.The new Disney English cast changes the way we perceive the characters, and not for the better. It makes Totoro somehow darker. There are dialogue changes (compared to the Fox edition) which simply do not work for me, apart from issues with the voice acting itself.The Disney version is still a charming movie, but the Fox version is more charming.

Why, well because I can't see anything topping the original Japanese voices.First of all, we have Shigesato Itoi.  If you know that name, then you are my best friend, because you probably recognize him as the genius behind Mother, Mother 2 (EarthBound), and Mother 3, the absolutely legendary RPG's.  He was the voice of the girls' father, and quite honestly I can't see anyone doing a better job.  He alone makes the original version superior in my opinion.While I realize that Miyazaki wishes that people might watch his movies in their own language so that they might spend their time looking at the art work rather than the subtitles, but honestly, I  still prefer the Japanese.Now wile I do prefer subs, I'm not entirely biased, for example, I think that Spirited Away and Monoke Hime have very very well done dubs, but I still believe that subs are generally the way to go.So in the end, it's a fantastic movie, with a fantastic Japanese language track.  If you really want a good English dub, then I would recommend you trust the other reviews, but if you want to see the movie the way it was written, the way it was intended, the better way, I would have to recommend sticking with this one.	5.0	Dub What?	2006-08-02	6	6	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2F5PAC9I5SCG6	Ernest Jagger	"First of all, I am a purist when it comes to Japanese films. I have three versions of ""My Neighbor Totoro."" The original in Japanese, without subtitles, the Fox version, and the Disney version. I would recommend viewers to just get the film, it's well worth the watch. I bought the first DVD in Japanese some years back when my daughters were very young. Both of them have been enrolled in a Japanese Immersion Program at their language school since they were 5-years-old. They speak, read and write Japanese.I bought the second for my wife and I, [Fox version] and thought it was great. Also, I bought the Disney version when my young nieces and nephews visited their cousins; since they cannot understand Japanese, they are able to listen to this version. I too am a purist; and believe that the inflections of Japanese; or any language in a foreign film should be the primary language listened to with subtitles. However, I also think that one can capture young children's attention--who would otherwise stray, if they were reading subtitles. I know this from experience as a father of two young Japanese-speaking American children.Therefore, while the spotlight reviewer skewers this DVD, I would recommend the film to those who are not sure if they would like to purchase the film. All one has to do is check my film listings, and you will see that I love Japanese cinema, and have since I was a child in the early to mid 1960s. I went to many Japanese films as a kid [Zatoichi] and saw Mizoguchi's, Kurosawa's and Ozu's films, to name just a few film directors that I grew up watching. The film is worth the purchase: Disney or not. There are plenty of reviews of this film describing this magical cinematic treat, and you and your children will definitely enjoy the film.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3NVO6YLZAM1EV	F. Altman	This is an incredible piece of art that should be seen by people of all ages.  While this movie is aimed towards children, anyone can enjoy it; I am an 18 year old male and watched it with a few of my friends, who all loved it as much as I did.  Hayao Miyazaki has a gift for making films seem real, for making the impossible a reality, and for making imaginative pieces that more than top the garbage that comes out of Disney these days.  This movie is guarenteed to bring a smile to the most depressed person's face, and it will delight all audiences.  And the catbus is awesome!  (Watch to see what I am talking about).

They love ""helping the garden/trees"" grow, they dance and sing to the opening credits, are thrilled to see the ""cat bus"" and adore Totoro (the cat-owl-raccoon inspired forest spirit).If your kids liked Ponyo, they'll more than likely like this as well (be warned though, the mother does have a vague illness [spoiler: she doesn't die])...and vice versa."	5.0	Great movie for young kids!	2012-07-16	0	0	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1IQV6AI7L9NOK	Feelah the tigress	"I just love this movie - and I'm an adult. It really is a very cute touching film, even if it is a bit slow. I personally found it to be very entertaining, and I'd recommend it as a family film.Miyazaki has done a great job of making the sisters seem believable as real children and also likeable - they're not too sweet/cute, but not too bratty. I also loved how elements of reality and fantasy were nicely interwoven - such that the appearance of the Totoro(s) felt believable, yet still cute(and who doesn't want to give the big Totoro a good squeeze?). The film also suceeds in presenting everything from the perspective of the children. Why don't we know exactly what's wrong with their mom? Because they don't exactly know. The information given is what the children perceive, thus we see the world through their eyes.I also enjoyed their portrayal of the father. He seems to be a very patient, loving father who actually spends some time with his children despite having to work a lot. It's very refreshing to see a film portrayal of the loving sensitive father (we could use more of that). For this reason I think the film has a very positive portrayal of family, thus making it a good family film (there's also a nice lack of violence and swearing, for those with small children). My only complaint is that there should have been more bonus features, like a making-of and maybe some interviews with people who actually made the film. However, this is a fault of the dvd release, not the film itself.Overall, My Neighbor Totoro is an excellent whimsical fantasy tale as well as a good coming of age tale. I highly recommend it both for children and adults.P.S. This review was originally for the 2006 release of Totoro, which didn't contain any worthwhile special features outside of the interviews with the voice actors. I recently bought the 2010 release with added bonus features, and I'm happy to say that more interesting features have been added. There's some interviews with Miyazaki, the producer, and the composer (which includes info. on other Ghibli films as well). My favorite segment (and by far the longest) is a section called ""the locations of totoro"", which basically shows you the real life locations upon which various scenes in Totoro are based. It's almost as charming as the film itself. In addition, the voice actor interviews and storyboards make a return. The last thing included is a sort of point and click game. Basically, you just click on various characters and objects and it gives you a brief description and scenes from the different Ghibli movies. It's rather dull, and I can't see even children being entertained by it. So, not much going on there... For all the people out there who wish to know, the movie includes the original Japanese audio track as well as English subtitles. It even has separate English subtitles for the hearing impaired. Hooray!This movie might be my favorite Studio Ghibli film of all time, although it's tied with Howl's Moving Castle and The Cat Returns. I'd definitely recommend you check out Miyazaki's other movies if you liked this one. Just be warned that not all of them are intended for children.P.P.S. - After seeing all the whining reviews from people who glorify the Fox dub as some kind of godsend, I felt the need to include this statement: Methinks nostalgia is clawing at some people's innards! Seriously, the only reason people who first watched the Fox dub then the Disney dub can't stand the Disney dub is because they've become accustomed to the Fox dub, and now anything different sounds strange to their ears. Since I'd never heard the Fox dub, I decided to go back and watch it on youtube to get an idea of what this amazing, better-than-Disney dub sounds like. Well, I couldn't stand it. All this makes me believe that people just form attachments to whichever they hear first, regardless of quality. Overall, the Disney release has the better quality though. The picture is brighter and clearer and the dub (believe it or not!) is actually closer the the original Japanese translation. Also, the Fanning sisters do a decent job of voicing Satsuki and Mei. It's just really irritating seeing all these one-star reviews from people who are like ""OMG this is the best movie of all time! BUT THE DUB SUCKS!"" when this fine film doesn't deserve one star (although I could see lowering it to three/four stars for disliking the dub, but not one star). So there you go; I'm going to get off my soap box now, I just felt the need to get that off my chest."	5.0	Totoro TO-toro, la la la la...	2008-08-29	1	1	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	ALR1CN6DL50DA	Felixpath	"If I have children, I will make sure that ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is among the first films they ever see. This is one of the purest, most untainted children's movies in existence, bursting with the kind of wonder and curiosity that few adults are able to hold onto. I'm guessing that Hayao Miyazaki is one of those adults; he has yet to produce a bad animated film, but ""Totoro"" may prove to be the most timeless. It speaks to the child in us all.If I told you that the movie is about two small girls who wander off on their own and hang out with strange, mysterious creatures -- with the approval of their parents -- would you be appalled? The biggest obstacle for ""Totoro"" is that it is very Japanese and reflects their society rather than ours, including the ""radical"" viewpoint that parents should trust their children, take them at face value, and let them explore rather than chaperoning them through life. But any parent who feels that this movie will be unhealthy for their children has forgotten what childhood is like. Childhood is scary, wondrous, frustrating, joyful, exhilarating, baffling, colorful, eccentric....and the list goes on. ""Totoro"" speaks plainly and directly to children with its words and images, and I cannot easily imagine a parent passing it over in favor of Disney Channel dreck.The plot is more of a situation: sisters Satsuki and Mei (ages 10 and 5, respectively) move into a wonderfully ramshackle new house in a rural district that seems locked in a simpler, gentler time. Their mother is ill and has been moved to a local hospital; their father, a professor of anthropology, is kind and caring and open-minded. The house is one every child should aspire to live in: quirky, unpredictable, and just unsafe enough to be fun. (Watch American mothers gasp in  horror as the girls casually play with a rotting, wobbly porch beam.) It is also, they soon learn, haunted. But these are not Western ghosts, which always seem to be terrifying and/or sad. These spirits are not the souls of the dead, but rather a part of the local environment itself. There are the Soot Sprites, scampering little balls of dust that flee from laughter. The Cat Bus, which is....well....both a cat and a bus. Most prominent are the Totoros, which resemble a furry, avocado-shaped cross between a cat, a rabbit, and an owl. Little Mei ventures into the forest and encounters a Totoro the size of a VW van, and although its toothy grin and guttural roar seem fearsome at first, it clearly means her no harm. It seems almost childlike itself, sleepy and curious and delighted by raindrops falling on an umbrella, though it eventually reveals itself to have great elemental power.There are no monsters or dangers in this world. It is not about a perilous adventure or quest, though the third act contains a straightforward crisis that must be overcome. It is about these sisters, who love each other and who love to explore. It is about their parents, who look them in the eye, tell them the truth, and believe what they say in turn. It is about something marvelous that they find, something they are still young enough to hold onto. (Significantly, the adults cannot see the Totoros.) It is about growing up and dealing with grownup things (such as sickness and the threat of loss), but still being able to scream and holler and be a kid. The situation is fantastical, but the characters, ironically enough, are some of the most real people that you will see in an animated film. At the end, we see enough to let us know that things will be all right, and then they are allowed to go on with their lives, and we are left to think about them, and dream. Few films have that simple power. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is easy to overlook, which is a pity, because it's one of the greatest films ever made. I mean that."	5.0	Childhood, Captured	2008-04-14	4	3	1

I come from a family of 6 siblings and this movie reminded me a lot of my times as a child. I lost my brother in a tragic car accident when I was 12 and he was only 15 at that time, seeing certain scenes of this movie like the two girls exploring the new house reminded me of a lot of good yet sad things about life. The two girls reminded me of looking up to my older brother and following him around imitating the things he said and did, which annoyed him :).

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3LQDYVAAHHV2T	FYI	"One of our favorite movies, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is magic for children of all ages, even those of us with whitening hair. You haven't truly lived until you've seen the catbus, with mouse headlights, flying over fields of rice, or perching in a tree. Trees are very important in this tale, similar in rich spiritual significance as J.R.R. Tolkien's love of trees and art (read ""Leaf by Niggle"" inThe Tolkien Reader). And the voice-work of Dakota and Elle Fanning is spectacular. Immediately, we are drawn into the story, as the kindly professor father of two little girls moves his family to be closer to the hospital where his wife is recovering from a long illness. The girls explore their new home, a haunted old house filled with small-smudge spirits. Wonderful, Japanese windows open wide to beautiful gardens, and a bathhouse with deep tubs for soaking. Tiny creatures, that only the girls can see, collect glowing acorns scattered around the half-wild property; the cuteness of these mini-Totoros is beyond description. Eventually, the young, squeaky-voiced Mei discovers a secret tunnel through the forest to an enormous tree with a hidden entrance to the lair of the Totoro, where she falls into a magic mushroom-lined tunnel to a gentle, beautiful realm. Later, the girls' father shows them a traditional shine next to the massive tree, and explains that the spirit of the forest lives there. Totoro even visits the girls one rainy evening with a leaf on his fizzy head as he enjoys the sounds of raindrops, and then calls the catbus for the first time. Friendship develops between the older sister, Satsuki, and a schoolmate, and his wise grandmother, who watches over the girls. All ends well with their mother recovering, indicated in the closing credits with the addition of a baby brother. One of the most exquisite animated scenes is when the Totoro and his tiny companions help the girls' seeds sprout, and then they all fly in the wind with up into their enormous new tree, under a starry sky; pure magic."	5.0	The Sun, Moon, and Stars	2012-07-10	5	5	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2BPDFR58H9575	Galina	"I absolutely agree with Roger Ebert who called ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""One of the most beloved of all family films"". Its colorfully bright and sparkling animation is enchanting. It is incredibly realistic and at the same time makes us along with two main characters, the young sisters ready for a miracle to happen any minute. The gentle story is touching, uplifting, funny, and tender without being overly sentimental or didactic. The film takes place in the early 50s, when 10-year-old Satsuki and her baby sister, curious and energetic 4-year-old Mei spend one summer in an old house in the country side with their University professor father while their mother recovers from a serious illness in the nearby hospital. The great master Hayao Miyazaki remembers well what it is like to be a child, to see magic in the everyday life and be always ready to encounter it. This ability usually disappears as the child becomes adult but it stays forever in a few chosen, and they become the visionary Artists - just like Miyazaki himself.  The film is partially autobiographical for the writer/director/storyboard artist. ""When Miyazaki and his brothers were children, his mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis for nine years, and spent much of her time hospitalized. It is implied, yet never revealed in the film, that Satsuki and Mei's mother also suffers from tuberculosis. He once said the film would have been too painful for him to make if the two protagonists were boys instead of girls."" (From the IMDB film trivia)Totoro of the title is an adorable funny blue forest spirit who lives in the nest beneath a huge tree and makes the trees grow and the winds blow. Totoro becomes the friend and protector of the sisters and one day he sends them on the bus journey that is like nothing they and the viewers could ever imagine. I wish I could ride that cat bus. What a wild and kind imagination an artist should have to create it. How much happier we all are knowing that Hayao Miyazaki exists and makes his amazing films at the Studio Ghibli for which King Totoro is the mascot."	5.0	Another miracle from Hayao Miyazaki	2007-10-15	2	2	0

Denick	"Feel good, furry, and funny- those are the adjectives I would use to describe the lovable ""Totoro"", the magical creature who inhabits the woodlands in this finely drawn animated film. Not by coincidence, those adjectives also do an accurate job of describing the movie itself. I had never even heard of this movie, which somehow escaped my notice, but a friend brought it to my attention the other day, and I'm glad she did. There is some cultural gap here (as I feel exists in all of the Ghibli movies), which will lead to some ""?"" moments, as western spectators try to digest this product of eastern imaginations. But this is to be expected of a Japanese animation, and it doesn't really hurt the story, which I thought was heartwarming, simple, and well told (my favorite character is the eternally optimistic father).And the cat bus... well, that's just plain weird. It is one of most imaginative things I've ever seen, while simultaneously doing a fine job of paying homage to the literary classic ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"".

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A24UHJRQZ9CSJE	George Su	"I'm actually disappointed with new blu ray release. I all honesty I couldn't watch more than 5 minutes before I had to turn it off. All of the original cast members from the 2005 English version are gone. I'm very disappointed that they replaced the voices with Tim Daly, Dakota Fanning, Elle Fanning, and Pat Carroll in this new Disney version from 2006+. The dialogue changed too. I'm quite disappointed with the change. The voices in the blu ray version lacks emotions and meaning. It's so bad that I am looking to buy the old DVD.So here's the deal for those of you who have not noticed or are unaware of the change. The original version that came out produced by Troma Films and 20th Century Fox (I believe) was much more entertaining translation. To put it lightly, there were quite a few elements that was ""lost in translation"" when the Disney version came out. For example, those black soot things with the eyes were referred in the Fox version as ""dust bunnies,"" while in the Disney version they are referred to as ""dust gremlins.""As much as I love Tim Daly as an actor, I could not stand him in this movie. It's pronounced TOE TOE ROW not TOE ROW ROW, for god sake pronounce it correctly. The original Fox version starred Greg Snegoff, Alexandra Kenworthy, Lisa Michelson, Cheryl Chase, Natalie Core, and Kenneth Hartman. If you're looking for the film, be sure to find the version prior to 2006 that was produced by Fox otherwise you'll be gravely disappointed as I was."	1.0	What happened to the original cast from the 2005 release?!?	2013-06-18	12	9	3
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A11X1W2VW6WHPK	Georgia C.	"It looks like fullscreen/widescreen (disney) versions of this movie are on the same page. Neither has Japanese subtitles - both are dubbed. I caught the older, non-Disney one which is pan and scan, and found the dubbing adequate. (Some users here seem pretty unhappy about the Disney one, which I cannot comment on.) My boyfriend threatened to walk away if he was forced to watch a pan-and-scan version (if you are going to rent it, since it doesn't seem to be for sale anymore), but he did watch it and seemed to enjoy the movie anyway with no significant or obvious disadvantages.The movie itself is great for people of all ages, but if you are thinking of showing it to a child, it helps to know if your child likes watching slightly more introspective, atmospheric movies that _don't_ crack a joke-a-minute with famous names and product tie-ins. Some kids might find this boring, but I'm sure loners and kids with bright imaginations will take to it and see the possibilities for their own creativity and wonder.basic, basic plot: two sisters (one is about 11, the other 5) move with their father to the Japanese countryside in the 1950s to be nearer their hospitalized mother. The nearby forest contains ""totoros,"" who are super adorable fluffy cat-owl creatures that protect the forest.I found the animation beautiful and the pacing very refreshing from what North American animation has offered in the past decade. The totoros are winsome and an antidote to the you-know-who aggressively ""cute"" (but actually just irritating) sidekicks and characters that are created to sell more toys. Totoro is silent, mysterious, charming and can sell me plenty of toys just by being himself. It's a very relaxing and highly recommended experience."	4.0	this is a review for the FULLSCREEN version	2008-10-22	2	2	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AQSQLWD3NLMAS	Glenn A. Buttkus	"Hayao Miyazaki, the writer/director of this lovely little film-was just hitting his stride when he released this fetching bit of Anime. This 1988 film led the way to PRINCESS MONONOKE (1997), SPIRITED AWAY (2001), and his latest triumph, HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (2005). Though he supervises a team of animators-he still prefers the old fashioned hand drawn-one cell at a time process-meaning that it takes him literally years to prepare each of this features. His movies have been labeled as ""visually enchanting"". He is a great artist and master-and is treated that way in Japan. He resents being referred to as the ""Japanese Walt Disney"".Roger Ebert has written that this film has ""become the most beloved of all family films-and it has done so without promotion-or a worldwide campaign."" I enjoyed Timothy Daly and Dakota Fanning's voice overs in the dubbed version. Of course it is always preferable to find the version in widescreen, and in the original Japanese with sub-titles. I was surprised to find out that the Totoros were not traditional Japanese mythological creatures. They are created directly from the mind and heart of Miyazaki.The film sets up a realistic scenario. A college professor Dad rents a cottage with his two young daughters in order to be near his wife-who is ill and has to stay in a hospital nearby. The plot included a charming family bathing scene that seemed to upset some Western viewers. It shouldn't have. Mei-the youngest daughter-is playing outside one day-and she chases what she believes to be a rabbit--but it is a small totoro-and it leads her to the King of the Forest-the great looming Totoro. The creatures are very loving and protective-just what little girls need in their lives.I adored the scene where the Totoro plant seeds at night-and a great tree sprung to life immediately-and the one where great Totoro produces a spinning top that allows him to fly-with the girls clinging to him. Totoro looks scary-but is benevolent. What a lovely lesson for children. My favorite creature was the Cat Bus-with eight quick paws-eyes for headlights-and the ability to fly. Adults can not see the Bus-only children can."	4.0	Totoro--Mon Ami	2005-07-22	5	3	2

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AI3V75Q28FZ7A	Gordon R Cameron	Having just watched Totoro for the first time, I'm an instant fan.  Between this and &quot;Princess Mononoke,&quot; I am coming to the understanding that Hayao Miyazaki is a major talent in animation -- a fact  others have known for years.I think no film, with the possible exception  of &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; and parts of &quot;ET&quot;, so effectively  captures the breathless excitement of childhood.  Watching  &quot;Totoro,&quot; I felt as though 10 years had been taken off my own  age.  One scene in particular -- the scene in the bus stop, in the rain --  is absolutely classic, and has quickly become one of my all-time  favorites.An obvious theme in Miyazaki's work is a reverence for nature  bordering on worship.  But Miyazaki's nature is not a cuddly, huggable  world of wisecracking animal sidekicks -- it is big, and intimidating, and  sometimes frightening.  Totoro himself, though unquestionably cute, does  not mug for the camera.  He has his own life and his own preoccupations,  and one senses that one must approach him with respect.  The little girls'  reactions to him and the Alice-in-Wonderland-esque Catbus often border on  fearfulness, which is exactly the right note to hit -- fear and wonder are  very closely linked, and Miyazaki understands this.And then there is the  craftmanship of the animation.  The attention to the smallest human  gestures, the careful observation of facial expressions and posture and  other silent behavioral cues -- mixed with the stunning vistas of the  natural world, rendered in beautiful watercolors.  This film is a pure  delight.	5.0	Pure joy	2000-06-25	6	6	0

We really enjoyed it. While I enjoyed Ponyo a little more, Totoro was still fun to watch.I really enjoyed the family ties in the film, the sense of adventure, and just the oddness of the film's plot. It was definitely a fresh film.I loved Ponyo, I enjoyed Totoro, and I'll continue discovering Miyazaki. If you want a cute, family-centered, enjoyable, but quirky film, get this. You'll like it.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AFL04X8D4TDG8	"Grady P. ""The Mock Turtle"""	"First off, I just want to say that I love Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's work tremendously. And for the most part, Disney's done a good job bringing their films to America. But, they were bound to screw up somewhere. This is where they did.My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful film with a great story and lovable characters. It's one of my favorite Studio Ghibli movies. So, if you're reading this, you're probably asking yourselves ""Why only two stars?"". Well, I saw this version of the movie on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) with their celebration of Mr. Miyazaki. I was appalled.Most of you probably know that this film was released in the US once before by Fox. Except for the fact that they didn't release it in wide-screen format, they had it down. Disney went and trashed a wonderful film.For starters, the lead character, Satsuki, is voiced by Dakota Fanning. Her performance was by far the worst. Sometimes Satsuki would be moving her mouth, but no words were coming out, if only for a second. At other times, she had too little emotion in her voice to do justice to Satsuki's current actions. And Dakota's sister, Elle, voices Satsuki's sister, Mei. Mei is supposed to be four years old, but the way Elle portrays Mei doesn't make her sound that way. Both girls voices sound too American and not believable. This is probably my biggest argument with Disney's release of Totoro.Next up, we have everybody else's voiceovers. For starters, Pat Carroll as Granny. I'd say that she was okay, but definitely could've been done much better. Then Tim Daly as the Father. Again, it was okay, but still could have been better. And yes, Frank Welker as Totoro and the Catbus. One is the title character, and the other is probably the most imaginative character in the story. For Totoro, Frank made him sound too ferocious. He is the king of the forest, but he's still cuddly! And he takes good care of Mei and Satsuki. I think he should have made Totoro sound a tad more friendly. As for Catbus, when I heard it my jaw dropped and I screamed for mercy. It sounded a lot like Stitch, from the movie Lilo and Stitch, (and in Lilo and Stitch 2 we hear Dakota again and sounds nothing like Daveigh Chase, the original Lilo, but that's another matter), and it made Catbus sound way too creepy and weird. I think the only voiceover I can agree with is the Mother, voiced by Lea Salonga.Lastly, I just can't see why Disney couldn't have kept Fox's voiceovers. They were great quality and believable, and if you watch both versions you'll probably agree with me. Whoever decided to do this movie again with these horrible voiceovers was probably one of the following. 1) He/She was deaf. 2) He/She is a Dakota Fanning fan. 3) He/She was high, drunk, or both. I just pray that John Lassetter or Hayao Miyazaki will see this and file a lawsuit.The only logical reason you should buy this DVD is either because you're getting it for a three year old who can't talk and won't care, or because you want the Japanese version of the film, also on this set. I'm buying this DVD for the second reason alone. If you don't care about watching this in Japanese, then I suggest scouring the internet for the discontinued Fox edition of the film, which is my plan."	2.0	"Listen to what I have to say before you vote ""NO"""	2006-01-20	377	264	113

Especially since Spirited is a bit dark and strange, and Totoro, while literally dark, is very warm and friendly for young children. My granddaughter at 2 is a huge anime fan and this is a fabulous movie, beautifully and movingly done, that her sister at 8 also enjoys immensely.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2UBSGFCP2QFNV	"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'"""	"As writer/director Hayao Miyazaki explains on the the new subtitled documentary material on this new Special Edition DVD, he was growing dissatisfied with the creative limits of working in television animation, he wanted to create a gentle, enchanting family feature regardless of the potential for commercial success.My Neighbor Totoro apparently did not smash box office records on the big screen in 1988, but subsequent TV airings made it one of the most popular and beloved films in Japan (not unlike what happened with the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory).Totoro is on the Studio Ghibli movies, an icon status comparable to Mickey Mouse with Disney and Luxo, Jr. with Pixar. But it all started in this film, which in a its second DVD release in the revised Disney English version, which was preceded by an earlier English version released by Fox.Each Miyazaki feature boasts a voice cast of marquee names as well as top Hollywood voice artists. The ""name"" talent is seen in brief ""behind the microphone"" bonus features -- in which you can sometimes also glimpse the strong supporting casts.Dakota and Elle Fanning turn in superb performances as the young sisters in Totoro, a very crucial element in making the English version work. Also in the cast are Tim Daly as the dad, Lea Salonga as the mom and the wondrous Pat Carroll as the warmhearted Nanny, a sharp constrast to her Ursula character in Disney's The Little Mermaid.The extraordinary Frank Welker growls as the Totoro himself. Welker, a gifted impressionist who entered voice work as the one and only Fred on Scooby Doo, is perhaps the most heard voice in film and TV today.The film itself is, to borrow from the Sherman Brothers, lovely and lyrical, filled with breaktaking landscapes and rich characters in a simple, pleasant tale that is a welcome break from the frenetic pace of most current entertainment."	5.0	A wonderful companion to Disney -- you're allowed to love both	2010-03-28	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3HO25V6X9MPVB	Greg H.	What has always amazed me about this film is its lack of standard film conventions.  For example,  the film lacks the usual diabolical villains that stand in the way of the heroes quest.  In fact, &quot;Totoro&quot;  even lacks a heroes quest, not to mention any sort of obvious conflict that  you would find in any other children's animated film or dumb teen  comedy.And that is because &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; is not just any  other animated film or story, it is a revolutionary work that explores the  essence and wonder of what it's like to be a child again. From getting  lost in an enchanted forest to creeping up a stairway that leads into a  dark and dusty attic, Hayoa Miyazaki creates an unbelievably magical feel  that will make you take a second look at the everyday environments that you  might usually take for granted and perhaps even give you a new found  respect for them. There is one scene in here which has received some  concerned criticism mostly from parents in the United States.  In it, a  father and his two daughters share a hot bath together, which was common in  Japan during the time period [circa 1950's].  Many viewers who considered  this scene overtly sexual and perverse have tried and lobbied to edit this  scene out, without success. Miyazaki, who was stunned that anyone could  mistake a completely innocent moment between a father and his children to  be sexual, had this to say [and I'm paraphrasing] &quot;It is sad that a  culture has come to a point where any interaction between a man and a child  can only be viewed as a sexual one.&quot;  Which is true, and which is why  only a non-American director could make a film without a shred of moral  corruption or cynicism and still make it enjoyable.	5.0	A Celebration of Innocence	2000-06-17	6	6	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A34RCR8322HIEF	Gregory A. Newkirk	I was surprised that Disney would produce another English translation since one had been done earlier by 20th Century. However, Disney's translation is a little better versed and the sound has a better quality.For those who have not seen Totoro, this is a must-have video for anyone interested in animated stories. After The Castle of Cagliostro, this is Hayao Miyazaki's greatest work. It is pitched for the delight of smaller children, but it easily captures the imagination of an adult. All of Disney's Studio Ghibli translations are worth owning. However, if I had to make a choice, I would chose Totoro over all the others.	5.0	Delightful	2007-11-21	3	3	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2E7KC0EI7QT8	"Greg Pauletti ""gdpetti"""	The first children's anime film classic from Ghibli that was paired with Grave of the Fireflies in its initial release. The latter being in a separate category all by itself as a heartrending telling of the aftermaths for a couple of kids after the firebombing of Kobe, Japan near the end of WW2. Weird to think of them paired together, but that's how things sometimes have to be done to get things done.This film is lovely. The story is so simple and beautifully executed on film. The fantastic with the normal like the dreamworld fusing into the reality of your life. Ghibli is known for this great artistic ability and why their films are always on the top lists for classics. Even as an adult this film works wonderfully like a kiss of sunlight on morning flowers. What a way to start a business, with this film and Grave of the Fireflies, both touching the heart of the child in most everyone.	5.0	My Neighbor Totoro anime film	2012-07-31	1	1	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A11AZG938XL5UU	Greg Polansky	Set against the backdrop of rural postwar Japan, Hayao Miyazaki's 'My Neighbor Totoro' is the story of two sisters' discovery of friendly wood spirits. Upon moving into a house, the girls discover a fantastical world both in their new home and in the environment around them - dust spirits, cat buses, and Totoros (3 of them!) While they learn the secrets of the world around them, the Totoros help the girls navigate the sadness of their mother's separation from them. With the Totoros' help, the girls manage to find a new emotional balance that helps them to come to terms with their mother's absence.If you're familiar with Studio Ghibli's films, then you know each film begins with the depiction of Totoro. And Totoro is so famous and well-loved that he even makes cameos in other films - in Toy Story 3 as a plushie for instance. This story is really heart warming and now that I've watched the film twice, I have to say that it ranks in the top ten animated films of all time for me. There are just certain moments that will leave you smiling - waiting at the bus stop, for instance, when Totoro discovers the pleasures of droplets falling on an umbrella. Also, now continuing in my Studio Ghibli watching, I have noticed some patterns. It seems Disney was not the only one obsessed with a mother's separation from her children. The first four Studio Ghibli films (Nausicaa*, Castle in the Sky, Grave of the Fireflies, and Totoro) all have an absent or separated mother. Just something to note and see if the pattern holds down the road.Additionally, if you have some knowledge of Japanese cultures and religions, then this story will make perfect sense given that the Japanese have traditionally believed in Animism, a belief system where animals and plants are imbued with spirits. Seriously, if you haven't watched this film, watch it. If you've already watched it, watch it again.*Technically not a Studio Ghibli film, but whatever.	5.0	Tooooo Toooooo Rooooo.	2012-04-21	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1	greg taylor	There are so many reviews of this masterful film that it is hard to justify another. But it is almost impossible not to want to tell people about this film. It is a delightful kid's film, an absorbing adult film and is therefore a member of that very small collection of art works that are truely family oriented.First, Miyazaki consistently creates the greatest girl characters that I know of. They are heartfelt, kind, independent, loving, brave and very determined. There is one scene where five year old Mei out of the corner of her eye sees a few tiny creepy crawling house spirits. Instead of running to someone for protection, she settles into this very determined look and posture and then goes off to investigate. It is a simple beautiful moment where a young child practices courage. This film is full of such moments.The animation is also full of moments of great natural beauty as well as surrealistic imagery. Miyazaki takes the time to show us beautiful forest scences or a rain puddle in a storm with a frog hopping across the screen. These moments are little haikus of animation.The totoros themselves, the CatBus and the other spirits are the work of a Japanese Lewis Carroll. This man's imagination and humanity are as timeless as Carroll's. This comes thru in all his films.Yes, I agree with the reviewer that said that the aspect ratio is bothersome (not to mention just plain stupid-how hard would it have been to give us the full ration version?). Art like this needs to be seen in all its glory. But art like this needs to be seen period. This is an easily available version at a great price. Do yourself and your kids a favor and buy this for them RIGHT NOW! Just so you know that I follow my own advice- I have a sixteen week old daughter and this is the first work of art I have bought her. I am looking forward to watching this movie many times with her.	5.0	A timeless masterpiece.	2002-12-04	2	1	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2HVL790PBWYTU	"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read"""	"My opinion only, but fans of animation must bow down to Hayao Miyazaki. In fact, fans of movies, in general, and of art must give Mr. Miyazaki his due propers. I've seen his recent stuff (Princess Mononoke,Spirited Away,Howl's Moving Castle) and am left awestruck. The man is a genius in his purview, and he works hard. Simply remarkable, the craftsmanship and soul and depth fused into these pictures. Having fanned myself into an addiction for more of Mr. Miyazaki's works, I've started to backtrack and catch up on his older films. MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, released in 1988, was my intro to his more classic stuff. Not too surprisingly, I really enjoyed it.Most folks consider MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO (or TONARI NO TOTORO) to be a masterpiece, and who am I to argue? Set on a more intimate scale than Mr. Miyazaki's other, more grandiose efforts, it's one of the best family films around, particularly in terms of portraying the family interrelationships. The way in which the two young girls connect to each other is disarming and a sheer pleasure to watch. Too, I like that their father isn't an absent parent by default, or one who's too busy or prone to misunderstanding and distrusting his kids (like in most American family films). When the youngest girl, Mei, tells her father (and her older sister) that she'd just encountered a ""totoro"" he doesn't dismiss her out of hand. He listens and even ventures an explanation. And it doesn't come off as condescending. In fact, the same thing happens earlier in the film, when the family was just moving into their new home and the girls glimpse the soot sprites. Dude's a cool dad.The plot, real quick: Two young girls (with their dad) move to rural Japan to be closer to their ailing mother, who temporarily resides in a nearby hospital. Along the way, the girls - the pre-teen Satsuki and her four-year-old sister Mei - meet Totoro, a large but benign forest spirit, whom only children can see. Totoro would become their friend and guardian.This is a rare film in that it contains neither villains nor violence. Mr. Miyazaki renders his supernatural world so benevolent and wondrous that it elicits delighted smiles, and not shudders. The scary moments instead stem from the girls' overriding fear that their sickly mother might not get better, that she might even die, a truly frightening prospect for children. And, because of Mr. Miyazaki's attention to detail and development of his characters, this concern becomes valid to us. You ache for the girls. Real people, real concerns.Visually, technically, emotionally, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is a beautiful film. No surprise then that Hayao Miyazaki writes, directs, and draws this thing. There's an enchanting simplicity here, with a leisurely pace and a narrative which isn't rushed. Again, respect to Mr. Miyazaki's attention to detail. We learn much of the Japanese culture; specifically, we gain an insight into Japan's agricultural way of life and the farmers' affinity with their environment. As usual, Mr. Miyazaki injects his cast with an appreciation and respect for nature. And nature reciprocates in the form of the forest spirit Totoro, whose simple pleasures are sights to behold, from his lazy enjoyment of an afternoon nap to his infectious glee at the raindrops pelting his umbrella.There's a joy in the sisters' interactions with Totoro.  There's something quite moving about this mysterious creature guiding the girls in a mystical rite to make their slow-growing acorns shoot up into mature oak trees. And there's something so right about Satsuki and Mei waking up later to realize that their planted seeds hadn't grown to full bloom after all, but that they did, however, finally begin to sprout. And, when, earlier, Totoro soared the night skies on his magical top, with the children and the little totoros crazily clinging to him, what a truly glorious and uplifting moment.A bit now on the dvd special features (from the Disney presentation). Disc 1 not only has the movie but also the following: ""Behind the Microphone"" - a segment featuring the English voiceover actors (Dakota and Elle Fanning are a delight); the Opening & Ending Title Sequence Art; and the original trailer. Meanwhile, Disc 2, if you have it, offers the original Japanese storyboards for the entire film.If there's one truly melancholy note here, it's in the thought that there'll come a day when Satsuki and Mei won't be able to see Totoro anymore. But, at least, in 2002, Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli came out with MEI AND THE KITTENBUS, a 13-minute-long follow up to MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO which demonstrates that at least Mei hasn't been deprived of hanging out with otherworldy company. Now if only Studio Ghibli will let us see the damn thing.As ever, Mr. Miyazaki's humanity and perceptiveness shine thru. And this I can't emphasize enough: The film has appealing magical creatures, yes. And the film presents several stunning magical sequences, sure. But the true magic lies in the sisters and how they relate to each other, and sometimes get annoyed with each other, yet continually care for each other. Satsuki and Mei are simply irresistible, wonderfully realized characters. The self-sufficiency and warmth of Satsuki. The cute stubbornness of Mei (maybe an ear of corn CAN cure maladies).

I was wrong.  My children(3 and 6) didn't even sit through half of it. I was bored early on and while the story seems cute and holds possibilities, I was very disappointed.  I got really disturbed by the characters' huge mouths.  My kids even commented on the funny faces and big open mouths.  And one thing I have noticed about these anime cartoons (even family ones) is the little girls keep showing their underpants.  I think it's a little creepy.  On a lighter note, fans of the Rugrats will notice that the little girl is voiced by the same person who does Angelica.	3.0	Didn't hold my attention	2004-01-18	8	0	8

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3RH47C0UJN373	Hillary	"Like several other people, I grew up watching Fox's version of Totoro. I've also lived and went to high school in Osaka for a spell, and have watched the original version on several occasions.This has been one of the most magical movies in my life since I was younger, and I'm thrilled that Disney decided to release several Miyazaki/Ghibli movies.So far, Disney has done wonderfully in my opinion, with other voice-overs of these films and with preserving the overall feel that the movie was originally supposed to have.They had quite a challenge, however, following the magnificent job that Fox had done years earlier.  A lot of ""diehard fans"" may or may not argue that Fox did a good job- I loved it because while some things may not have been directly translated (the opening theme), the overall feeling of the movie stayed the same and the voices fit wonderfully with the characters. Totoro is a kid's movie- it always has been and always will be, so I believe that it should be presented as such... it just happens to be a kid's movie that has a little magic in it for people of other ages, as well.The voice acting in this version is well done, as is the translation job of course (this -is- Disney), but to people who are used to either hearing the original movie or the Fox version, a little something new might come as a shock to the ears.  It is still a perfectly wonderful version, but I have to wonder if the voice actors they chose were the best choices they could have made.  I don't say this often, as people like Kirsten Dunst who did an -awsome- job with Kiki are certainly suited for the job, but I wondered if Disney didn't just pick people for their star names, instead of how well they did in their roles.I'm not saying that anyone performed badly, but I think that there are several other people out there with more (or maybe none) experience in voice acting that would be able to handle the voice-over job in a way that would fit in more with the movie.The girls, of course, sounded good acting wise, but left a bit to be desired.. too often did I feel like they were too disconnected from the movie and what exactly was going on, and just ended up reading the lines well and not trying to fit what they were saying into the big picture.If you pick up this movie, I recommend also trying out Fox's version as well- it's worth it to watch.I appreciate Disney for translating these wonderful movies, and they do an excellent job- I just hope that they are a little more careful in choosing stars as voice actors- sometimes it pays to pick a cast with a little more experience or skill, but less fame."	3.0	A little bias may play into how one might view this movie.	2006-04-15	9	7	2

I finally got my hands on a copy and honestly I was a tad disappointed. While I love the sense of wonderment and childhood innocence that this film bestows, I feel that it was too short and ended just as soon as it was really starting to get going. I love the character of totoro, he's such a giant cute ball of fur, I felt sad after watching this that such a creature doesn't exist in real life. However, his screentime is very limited and makes his first appearance somewhere between (I'm totally guessing here) the first 45 to 60 minutes. But if there's one thing Miyazaki does well is convey a sense of stellar imagination and MNT has that in spades. Personally I love his other works more but this is a classic too in its own right.	3.0	Not Miyazaki's best	2013-05-15	8	0	8

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2C89HB8VN96JV	Idontusemynameontheinternet	I'd like to start by saying I have nothing but the utmost respect for Studio Ghibli, and for My Neighbor Totoro as a children's film. That said, I absolutely loathe Disney's English dub of this film.Disney's blu-ray release of this film was highly anticipated, and rightly so, it's a beautful charming film, that doesn't seem to rely on the adult supposition of what a life is like for a child, and, unlike Disney, doesn't create a perilous environment of evil-doers as a way to ratchet up tension. In many ways it's a slyly lazy little film of childhood innocence and exploration as a means of coping with the more adult problems of change and fear. The usual Ghibli subtext of the magic of nature is present too.Where Disney's release falls flat though is the tragic dubbing. Most of the voice work on this release is done by regular actors not actors devoted to the craft of voicework, and it shows. The film is poorly synced with the dialogue, and the acting, especially by the child actors is awful and disrupts the flow of the film entirely. It would be one thing if there wasn't already a better English version on the market (though currently out-of-print) from Fox/Streamline. The Fox version features exceptional voicework by industry voice actors who are familiar with the intricacies of Japanese anime, whereas Disney opted for redubbing the entire film with the likes of Dakota and Elle Fanning, and Frank Welker (who voices animals for Disney and others for a living but just ruins Totoro with excess in my opinion). It's a tragic mistake that would almost be forgivable if Disney would just pony up the cash and buy the recording from Fox and allow it as an option for those of us that prefer it, as was rumored with the Blu-ray release. The problem is that the Fox version was released prior to Disney's contract with Ghibli, and perhaps Disney would rather pay their own actors rather than entertain the idea that someone else's version might be superior, or perhaps it was just cheaper to do so. It's sad because the Disney version just feels empty and the audio mix sounds too clean and airy, whereas if you switch to the Japanese language mix you can see how it was meant to be done. The kids voices, for example, blend neatly with the ambient sounds of insect, weather, and traffic, whereas Disney relegates humans to the extreme forefront, and everything else is left behind.The good news is, you can't go wrong with this film. It's beautifully animated, intelligent and well-crafted, and you won't find a story more suitable for children in any of Disney's oeuvre, but you could spend your money on one of the few remaining copies of the out-of-print Fox version, instead of supporting Disney's lousy choice. Or, you could buy the Disney version and listen to the Japanese audio with subtitles for a truly authentic experience.PS Disney pulled the same stunt with their release of Ghibli's Kiki's Delivery Service. What a tragic horrible misdeed. Using Phil Hartman as a cat -- ugh. Unfortunately, Streamline didn't release this film on DVD, only VHS, so we're stuck with it until Disney comes to their senses. Maybe someone with clout will start a letter-writing campaign?	3.0	Totoro, great film, lousy audio options on this release, even on Blu-Ray.	2013-05-21	12	10	2

It is a pure, sweet, innocent joy to watch, and seeing it always made me feel a little happier.What was even better was introducing it to my 3 year old and discovering that we could enjoy watching it together.  There are no guns, no violence, no bad words, no loud obnoxious songs or characters;  but lots of quiet spaces, beautiful and inspiring animation (if you've read a little about Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki you know that Disney animators revere him, and even use his films to draw inspiration), realistic and 3 dimensional characterization (Mei and Satsuki act age appropriate - !!), and a story that really draws you into caring for this imaginary family.  Responsibility and respect for others, for family, for the world around you is embedded so deeply in this movie that I feel a little less bad about letting my son watch it so much.Fox has done a wonderful, respectful dub of this movie, but their DVD release is nothing but a simple transfer from the VHS.  If you are looking for any extras or the original japanese, you'll just have to wait for the Disney take on it.  If it is going to be anything like the other releases, it will have the original japanese audio on it.  When they do, don't forget to check out the original japanese theme songs.  Too cute!Speaking of Disney, it truly boggles my mind that now that it has the distribution rights for this movie, it has not gotten its act together and done a proper release.  I was all set to buy the DVD back in June 2004 (when I first noticed it scheduled for release), then in August, then in February.  But then Totoro was abrubtly, and inexplicably taken off of the release schedule, and _The Cat Returns_ put in its place, which is a semi-sequel to *another*  as yet to be released Ghibli movie (huh?!) by Disney to the US. (Incidentally, _Whisper of the Heart_, the predecessor of _The Cat Returns_ ,is my favorite Ghibli movie, and I am curious to see how they deal with the particular difficulty of translating it since it is soooo Japanese)If Disney were smart (but they're not, they're mercenary, and don't like Miyazaki's old classic material eclipsing and eating into the profits of their latest and worst sequels to mediocre movies - what's next, Hercules 2? Ack!), they would have set the release date for these movies closer to the holidays.  In delaying the release of Totoro, yet again, they are just giving more money to Fox, as irritated fans buy the DVD because their VHS copy is wearing a little thin from the repeated viewing.If Disney were *really* smart, they'd actually release this movie in theatres.  It would make me so happy to have this movie be the very first movie I could take my son to see.  And then a week later, and then a week later, and then a week later  ... etc....Please, someone at Disney, hear my plea...  wide release Totoro ... wide release Totoro...	5.0	A sweet re-watchable movie for kids of all ages	2005-03-15	9	8	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A735M4VH087H8	"Jadepearl ""geezer geek"""	This film is satisfying on several levels:1) animation is done with extreme care; 2) plot is leisurely and well scoped; 3) the relationships - human and non-human are done very well. 4) original and a very nice break  from DisneyI recommend this film to anyone with a child or even a  child's sense of wonder.  For those who prefer a gritty plot, explosions,  and relationships fraught with trauma this is not your film.Many films  both animated and regular place children as horrible stereotypes which this  film does not.  Not too sweet nor too jaded - a good balance is struck here  for all the characters involved.I recommend this film in particular to  people who have daughters.  Studio Ghibli has always done wonderful work  with females as lead characters.  Female characterization by Ghibli is the  most solid of all the anime studios and alas, many regular film studios.  The female characters are done with depth and a certain understanding that  is rare.  You see this further in such films as _Kiki's Delivery Service_,  _Castle LaPuta_, and _Porco Rosso_.  I have yet to come away from a Ghibli  film that the word, &quot;wow&quot;, was not attached.  If you are  fortunate and get a chance to truly see the animation say this to yourself,  &quot;this was all drawn by Miyazake&quot; and not a stable of artists or  computer generated (except for parts of Princess Mononoke).If you are  fearful of the accusations and stereotypes of Japanese animation being too  stylized, stiff, or lacking in plot that is sensible then see _Totoro_ or  any Ghibli Studio product and see if they say the same thing afterwards.  Further, take a look at the reviews from non-anime fans.  It says something  that they are moved as well.For parents I would say that this work will  cause a sense of wonder and enjoyment for their young children.  Get used  to your children drawing the catbus and questions (children will ask where  is Totoro and the dust bunnies).  Not a bad tradeoff in consideration the  alternative is Pokemon (blech!)As anecdote -- my co-worker thought my  Totoro doll was hellaciously weird and ugly.  Time passes and now a gray  Totoro graces her desk.Watch and enjoy.  This quality of stuff rarely  passes through our media soaked world so unscathed.	5.0	worth every dime	2000-03-15	9	9	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A26O0T192IBKY1	J. Alford	"Probably the most memorable of all of Miyazaki's movies, this one has become a true legend in the field of animation. This one was done mostly for young children, and it pulls it off wonderfully without being too cheesy or sappy. My Neighbor Totoro is one of thoes anime movies that every otaku must see, like Akira or Ghost In The Shell, not as some kind of oblitagion to proove your ""otakuship"", but because its one of the living examples of what makes anime great!Set in the 1950s, a father and his two daughters move into an old house in the Japanese countryside. Their mother is currently sick in the hospital with an unspecified condition. The girls are Satsuki and her younger sister Mei. They discover that their house is haunted(in a friendly way)by some soot-like spirits(who also make an appearance in Spirited Away). Mei also finds two strange bunnylike creatures, and follows them to a much-larger forest spirit who calls himself Totoro. Satsuki doesn't believe her at first, but one night when she and Mei wait for their father at a bus stop during a rainstorm, she's suprised to see Totoro standing next to her. After offering him a spare umbrella, he gives them some seeds, and then gets a ride on a giant cat bus! The girls plant the seeds in their backyard, and Totoro visits them the next night by making them into a huge tree, which is gone by the next morning. Later on, its reported that their mother has taken a turn for the worst, and Mei goes missing trying to get to the hospital. Satsuki searches for Totoro in his lair, who summons the Catbus, and takes her to Mei. They then take the Catbus to go see that their mother has recovered, and then return home.This movie has seen two releases in English, one through the now totally out of the scene Streamline Pictures, which was picked up by Troma Films(the guys who did Toxic Avenger), and later released on DVD through Fox. But later on, Disney bought most of all the other Studio Ghibli titles, and redubbed it with some celebrity voice-overs, with Dakota Fanning and her sister Elle doing Satsuki and Mai. Weirdly enough, when this movie was released in Japan, it was shown with Grave Of The Fireflies, which is one of most depressing(but still brilliant)anime titles ever, so its more than a little odd to be showing it with this upbeat family movie. Admittedly, the story itself does kinda pace along slowly, and there isn't much of a deep plot to speak of. This is all minor though considering how whimsical and entertaining it is, and for all ages. The impact the movie made has lead to several enviromental campaigns to be carried out in Totoro's name, and there's even a brief cameo of a Totoro doll in the recent Toy Story 3 movie. There's also a short spinoff movie that you can only catch at the Ghibli Museum in Japan.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A34QUWXZKPVJD4	James Ferer	"Disney continues its lack of respect for Studio Ghibli's wonderful material. As a company that only sees ""product,"" My Neighbor Totoro doesn't get the attention it deserves. (It deserves a theatrical re-release, actually, but I digress). Dakota Fanning and Elle Fanning do their jobs, but they are not better than the actors in the Fox version. Professor Kusakabe, the father, is given a lesser performance, as is the grandmother.I was also vaguely disturbed by the music, which sounds different to me in small ways compared to the Fox release. Jo Hisaishi's terrific score deserves loving care.The positive here is that the visuals are better.  I was glad for the wider format, and the colors were more vibrant, closer to the amazing color of Spirited Away, the best colored animation in many years.I wish I could show this version with the Fox soundtrack."	3.0	A step backward in the performances	2006-03-26	10	7	3
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2UONLYIFN6ZS3	"James G ""J.M.G."""	Fun to watch, entertaining, and completely creative. These are only three of the many reasons I adore Studio Ghibli productions. I am waiting for the 2-disc special editon because this DVD does not include the Japanese language track. With Anime, I watch it first in English to get the basic plot and then I watch it in Japanese with the subtitles because it adds much more clarity to the story line. The DVD is in full screen (yuck) and the bonus features are bogus. But the movie is warm hearted and very clever. Who could ever think of a catbus other than Miyazaki? Honestly, I think this guy's more creative than Walt Disney himself. But I still respect Disney because they have done an excellent job (so far) with Spirited Away and Castle in the Sky.	5.0	Tonari no Totoro!	2005-04-25	2	1	1
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A24UA3WUB5IAF1	JAMES J JOSLIN	This movie is beloved by my family, and is great for kids. Unfortunately, the newer Disney release was re-recorded (the English dub). Luckily, this is the original 20th Century Fox release of the movie with original English dub (and believe me, it matters)! It may not have the extras of the newer DVD version, but who cares when the original DVD release had the best English dub of the film? I want the best English version of the movie more than I want extras. This movie is HIGHLY recommended for all Miyazaki fans, and Anime fans in general.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3T8APPB2LGHF0	"James L. Webster III ""webslog"""	"Six stars for Totoro, zero stars for Disney's hachet job on a beutiful movie averages to three stars in my book.If you're a Miyazaki vet reconnecting with Setsuki, Mei, the dust bunnies and Catbus, this is *not* the version you're looking for.  Search elsewhere on Amazon for the version distributed by Fox.  Disney has re-voiced this instant classic with Dakota Fanning and Pat Carroll.  No offense to their acting abilities, but Disney's tried to crank out a Mona Lisa using paint-by-numbers and have largely succeeded.If you're new to Totoro, my advice holds.  To call this an instant classic sell it short on so many levels.  The webslog family is four in number, with our kids largely corresponding in age to Setsuki and Mei. This movie has become a part of our family's unspoken list of ""Media that we want our kids and their kids and so on to experience"" right up there with Richard Scarrey, Bugs Bunny and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.The Fox version (even with voiceovers) put me in rural Japan so firmly and completely that I wish I lived there.  The illustration, landscapes, etc. are lush to a fault, and the VO actors selected in the Fox version fit the age and innocence of the children to a T.FWIW, the lit crit geek in me guesses that we're in post-Nagasaki Marshall-plan Japan; Mom's in the hospital for radiation poisoning, and I'm not altogether sure she'll make it out of the hospital, making the entire story that much more poignant."	3.0	Caveat emptor - Disney's made a mess of this classic.	2006-05-04	14	12	2
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1TGXBJ96E9B8B	James M. Stafford III	In a recent course I taught on Japanese animation, I used My Neighbor Totoro during the section of the course on auteur theory and Hayao Miyazaki.  Students ranged from 17 to 30-something, from anime newcomers to diehard otaku, and they ALL seemed to really love this film.  My Neighbor Totoro speaks to the child within us all, the child that wants to play and interact with the imagination and with creatures that adults cannot see.Mei and Satsuki both embody that child within us all.  Through these two young girls, we discover Totoro, Nekobus/Catbus, and plenty of other imaginary/magical/fantasy creatures which are often comedic and always kind and caring towards the children.  The girls learn from these creatures, and teach the creatures as well; Totoro's first experience with an umbrella is one of the more touching (and comedic) moments in the film.Best of all, My Neighbor Totoro differs from much of the anime available currently in the States in one important area: dubbing.  The voice-acting is absolutely SUPERB - compared to the third and fourth seasons of Sailor Moon, which had such horrible voice-acting that they can only be watched with the sound turned off.  The voice-acting is excellent in providing an aural portrayal of the characters of the film.This is one of the best films ever for children... and their parents.  My Neighbor Totoro shows a lot of imagination on the part of Hayao Miyazaki and his animation team; I would truly LOVE to see the original or subtitled versions to experience the film as originally intended.	5.0	Perhaps the BEST Film for Children AND Adults	2002-07-03	1	1	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A13DZQ0NPX855S	jancola	Please ignore the review above that says this DVD is bad - this review refers to an earlier editon of the DVD, not the grand-spanking new Disney version.Disney has started to do unbelievably good dubs of Miyazaki's DVDs, and this one is one of the best.  The two little girls on this disc are voiced by Dakota Fanning and her little sister Elle Fanning, and both of them do a bang-up job.  When Elle cries, you will cry.  Their father is also well cast, as Tim Daly, voice of Superman on Justice League.  Usually with anime, I listen to the Japanese tracks, but with these new dubs, even Miyazaki agrees that the voices are sometimes better.The quality of the video is also outstanding.  Disney has given the same treatment to Miyazaki's movies that it gave to its own classics like Aladdin and Lion King.  Bold colors, perfect compression, and crystal sound.And it goes without saying that this movie has a great story.  It is touted as one of the most beloved family movies of all time, and I have to agree.	5.0	Perfect movie, great disc	2006-03-16	9	6	3

I always see something new in its gorgeous animation. The story is of two sisters experiencing a magical connection with the king of the forest (Totoro) who teaches them and helps them in a time of need.  The girl characters are strong, curious, brave and know what they want.  Their loving father, a bit distracted by work and a wife in the hospital, is willing to beleive that the girls have indeed had a brush with the fantastic. Hitoshi Takagi, who recently released the amazing animated film Spirited Away, is considered, in Japan, to be a national treasure.  If I could only have one childrens video( for kids aged 2to 8), this  classic would be my choice.	5.0	our family's favorite	2002-12-18	1	0	1

Fox's version was better eventhough they butchered the aspect ratio.  I thought EDL's Mom's(another reviewer) comment was funny.  Clearly she does not understand traditional Japanese family life.

This is the actual 1988 film by Miyazaki, and features both the original japanese audio as well as the english dub with Dakota and Elle Fanning as the two sisters. I've never heard the prior English dub so I will not comment on it, but if you don't like the english dub, then switch over to the Japanese with the subtitles. It's pretty simple.I think the movie is amazing in its own right and has more than enough charm and character to make up for a simple plot.	5.0	Note on negative reviews	2010-08-08	13	12	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1YLB6X6ONPGR5	jbsquid	This movie is about a family in 1955 Japan with two girls, Satsuki and her four year old sister Mei.  I estimate that Satsuki is about ten years old.  I love the exuberance of the two girls.  I love seeing the Japanese countryside and their way of life.  In Blu-Ray, some images of the countryside are like paintings that should be framed and put on the wall.  In the past four months, I've watched this movie twenty-seven times, four times in English, and twenty-three times in Japanese with English subtitles.

Anyway, my point is i LOVE good movies, and this is good -- one of the best. Animation or not, it is good because it is a good story. Watch it. Suspend disbelief. Go with it.

The sisters meet the magical characters that inhabit the area as they worry about their mom. The literary term &quot;magic realism&quot; come to mind as magic occurs as if such impossible things actually do happen every day.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	ABBHUMPGEDMF3	Jeff Rogers	This is my first review. I was first introduced to My Neighbor Totoro about 4 years ago by a friend. It was instantly a favorite of mine and my kids. Mayazakis' attention to detail (Notice the bottle under the house with the marble stopper in it for instance) as well as the way he conveys the feeling of a hot, summer day, a late afternoon thunderstorm or a sultry full moon night, is artfully and effectively accomplished. And there's no extraneous fillers or wasted moments. This movie remains not only of my daughters favorites but their dads' as well. I'm guessing that it's resurgence in popularity indicates a re-release perhaps? or perhaps a marketing ploy...(I'd heard somewhere that Disney bought the rights. Don't know  if that's true or not)... I've seen both the Japanese voiced version and the English version and I feel the English voices were well cast. Perhaps, when I finally do get a DVD player, there'll be a letterbox version of this movie available and will be able to see the whole darned thing	5.0	All animation should be this rich!	2001-01-29	9	8	1

I'm nostalgic like that!So finding this DVD on here for such a great price really got my excited! I watched it the minute I got it.  Its funny that my mom introduced me to this movie because I am now in love with all of Hayao Miyazaki's movies and own almost all of them on DVD now!Though this version may not come with extras and fun bonus material, its worth it for the great quality of English dubbing! Though I love the Fanning girls, I don't think they have a future in animation voices. :DTo this day when ever I pop one into the DVD player and watch one, she rolls her eyes at me and laughs, she says I'll never grow up, but I just like reliving one of my favorite past-times!	5.0	Great memories for an awesome price!	2011-01-13	3	2	1

The night that ""My Neighbor Totorro"" was coming on, I just happened to have the t.v. on.  First, I heard the introduction by TCM host Ben Mankowitz (nephew of director Joseph L. Mankowitz).  I became intrigued and left the t.v. on.  My 11 year old son wandered into the room and sat down.  I sat down, followed by my 15 year old son and my ex-husband who happened to be visiting rounded out the group.  We were enchanted!!  After that we watched all the Miyazaki films for the rest of the month.  Since then, we have seen the previous English dubbed version and I didn't like it as much.  The Disney ""Americanized"" versions of Miyazaki's films may disgust anime purists but they open up the whole world of Miyazaki to people that otherwise might never give these films a second glance simply because they are ""foreign and strange"".

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AT8T86L27VXA9	"Jennifer A. Ciaccio ""Mom Extraordinaire"""	My Neighbor Totoro is a movie of pure joy.  Although the plot is simple enough for young children to follow, it is still equally enjoyable to adults of all ages.  Set in Japan, it allows an accurate and intimate look inside its culture and beautiful country, without distracting from the story or straying from universal themes that touch us all.  Two young girls, and their Professor father, move to the countryside, near to the hospital where their mother is a patient.  Their beautiful old farmhouse is haunted, and all three of them are delighted!  It does not take the youngest girl long to meet Totoro, the nearby spirit of the forest, who takes the two children under his wing as they struggle with their fears for their mother's health.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A17UXOGNEMH8YX	Jerry Goodnough	I must concur with the other reviewers of this DVD... I love this movies, and indeed bought a DVD player that could play the Original Japanese DVD release. This 'Fox' release is a poor substitute for the original film. In specific this production is Pan &amp; Scan, and while you might be able to follow the plot, the beauty of the Miyazaki film is lost. Indeed the trimming of the picture often makes the color composition off. Also the DVD seems to be a bit over saturated, and a little off to the red side. Other basic things lacking: captions (of any form - even English!), other languages (Spanish, French would have been nice - this is a region 1 DVD after all, likewise it would have been nice to have the Japanese - some kids out there are learning this language), and indeed any extras. Given all of this the DVD is quite poor, but the story is wonderful... So get the best copy you can afford and enjoy.	2.0	Wonderful Movie, poor DVD	2002-12-03	62	52	10

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2FZZUTBVXN8Q7	"Jewels ""bookgrrl"""	My Neighbor Totoro has become one of my animated favorites.  It is a simple and delightful tale of all ages.  I believe it to be a masterpiece.  The characters are believable...the story is simplistic, yet heartwarming.  I found myself in both laughter and tears with this film.The story takes place in Japan.  Two young girls and their father find a new home.  Their mother is in the hospital for an unknown illness.  As they spend more time in the home, the youngest girl Mei, finds a forest den in which little totoros and the King Totoro lives.My first impression of the film was that it seemed outdated.  The animations were well done and charming, but didn't seem as crisp and colorful as today's films.  Still I understand that it is an older movie.The movie ended way too quickly because I wanted to keep watching more, but it took a sudden end.  It was a complete and fullfilling ending nevertheless, it just felt like there should've been more in the middle.  I thought I would be seeing more of the Catbus and Totoro, (since the movie is named, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;).  The presence of the cute furry animals seemed short lived.  Still, the adventures two sisters go on is unforgettable.I do not thing very young kids or anyone with a short attention span would enjoy this film, because the film focuses a lot on a simple adventures and many times slow story progression.  The scenes are memorable, artistic, and imaginative, but it still takes a tentive viewer to enjoy it without getting anxious for some action.Overall, I give the feature of this film 5 Stars.  Everything about it from beginning to end had great qualities to it.  The DVD version of this isn't very impressive because it lacks features.  So if you buy DVDs for their features, this one lacks them.Delightful, cute, and heartwarming...it's a film that everyone needs to watch now and then, to relax and enjoy the pleasurable things in life.	5.0	Delightful, Cute, and Heartwarming.	2004-04-23	1	1	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	ATV6TIDGPSGX2	J Gabriel	"I would give this film a 4.5 out of 5 it that was possible. Miazaki's world of adventure and strange creatures is unparalleled in film.  Few directors (writers, etc.) have the ability to create such works of truly catholic appeal. The movie will grab you from the beginning and draw you into a place that may (or may not) exist in the mind of any child.  Not only is this a great movie for the youngest children, it also attracts us jaded grown-ups.  It's a chance to remember what is was like to dream innocent dreams.  In that respect, Miazaki does what few since Disney could do. He creates an escape pod for all ages to a wonderful fantasy world. ""Cute"" need not always be a bad word. If you have children, or if you just need a break from the drama of the real world, I recommend you meet Totoro.

Personally, I especially enjoyed the depiction of the Japanese countryside and lifestyle of the 50s. It was beautifully captured. I have almost the entire collection of Studio Ghibli and each DVD is an absolute delight.My Neighbor Totoro is the story of two little girls who move to an old house in the country. Their father works at the University in the city and their mother is in hospital so the girls are looked after by an elderly neighbour during the day. Of course they discover Totoro, the Spirit of the Forest, and when they need his help he comes to their aid. Their is an innocence and joy in the Ghibli DVDs that is missing in most modern children's entertainment. And this one is no exception!	5.0	My Neighbor Totoro	2010-05-04	2	2	0

We have watched the VHS version of it for over ten years, and have become familiar with the voices of those actors and can nearly recite the script.  The DVD is a new translation with different actors.  It is not the same as the VHS.  The differences are small, but there are differences.  Of course, my children say they prefer the old one, but it may be familiarity rather than critical preference.

Don't let this fool you.The 2-disk WIDESCREEN edition is a Disney--not a Fox--release, so chances are (and previous releases in this series are a good indicator) this will have both dubbed and Japanese language tracks.Disney has done wonderful job with other Miyazaki films, and I have no doubt this will be the same.This will be the definitive Totoro release, and WELL worth purchasing.* * * * *Old Review (single disk, Fox)Why does everyone keep knocking Disney for the poor quality of this DVD when Fox (not Disney) has the U.S. rights to the Totoro?  You should be *grateful* to Disney for bringing so many wonderful Studio Ghibli films to the U.S. -- and they've done an absolutely wonderful job with Kiki and Spirited Away, etc. (and will, I imagine, continue to do so with future releases of this sort).Totoro is a terrific movie, but a terrible DVD.  If you don't like that, write to the people at Fox.  And stop beating up on Disney.I'd love to see a special edition of Totoro with Japanese language track, letterbox, etc., but it's not going to happen if fans keep grumbling at Disney -- who has nothing to do with this current version.	1.0	Blame Fox, Not Disney	2003-09-19	26	18	8

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3BC8YL69NOCUP	jmpg	My Neighbor Totoro (Tonari no Totoro as I'm familiar with) was such a satisfying, delightful movie that I recommended it to my parents and other friends. Thought anime was going in a wrong direction? Watch a Miyazaki film. When I rented it, my parents told me I'm not for kid movies anymore, but a Hayao Miyazaki film is for everyone. I recommend it to anyone who just wants to watch an excellent film, more or less a little masterpiece in its own way.At first, watching the opening few scenes got me thinking that it was going to be a movie strictly aimed towards children, but as the movie progressed, I found it to be touching and full of delight. Unlike Disney movies, there are no lyrical songs needed to give light to the story or to lengthen the plot. Also, the movie is just a simple plot about two young girls who befriend a spirit of the forest, Totoro, after moving into a new house. The story won't stumble or lose the viewer because My Neighbor Totoro is a tangible dance all the way. The characters are colorful, charming, and most of all, imaginative. You'll be entranced when you see Totoro and his buddies, especially that awesome 12-legged cat bus. Everything in this movie brings out the wonder of enchantment and belief.You can't enjoy an animated picture without the eye-candy. Miyazaki's trademark use of beautiful vibrant colors are all here. It's just nice to look at. The music adds much, too. The film was scored by Joe Hisiashi, who pretty much scored all of Miyazaki's works. This is one admirable soundtrack. The Totoro theme song will surely get you boppin.From beginning to end, Totoro is a well-made animated picture that will make you thank yourself you saw a Miyazaki film. This is visual imagination that is Disney-caliber and more. If you're a parent try to pick this one up because your kids could fall in love with it; everyone in-between will enjoy it as well. Savor every moment... it's such a satisfying film to watch. Kid movies rock.	5.0	Rare animation you won't find from Disney	2000-10-10	4	4	0

Sweeping Japanese landscapes and gorgeous hand-drawn imagery by the director outfit this gentle story, in which two girls find solace in their friendship with a menagerie of affectionate mystical beings.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3A48XEYWLWH7T	John IV	Wednesday, June 15, 2005 / 5 of 5 / Wonderful even with the dubbing.I try to watch my anime with the Japanese soundtrack as I took it in high-school and college and it's a reminder of how quickly you can lose it if you don't use it.  The cadence and flow of the language is superior in its original format vs dubbing the vast majority of the time and subtitles are not an issue once you get used to using them.  That said, Totoro only had an English dub, but wasn't too bad.  Coming to Totoro from Castle in the Sky I continued by chronological trek of the Miyazaki cannon.  It's a testament to the director and storywriter that 30 somethings can enjoy his films as much as the children that are ostensibly his target.  Totoro centers around a couple of young siblings who move with their parents to a remote rural location in Japan, their house in the shadow of a mountainous forest overseen by the giant, shaggy, rabbit like Totoro and his helpers.  It boggles my mind that something so child-like in this story can be so compelling for adults.  As an avid fan of anime I've rarely been moved like I have with Miyazaki's movies and this story was one of his lightest and sweetest.  The only conflict in the story is the younger sister Mei running off.  The rest is a languid exploration of the area around the house and meeting with Totoro and his companions.  I love the artwork on the forest and rural settings and the attention to detail these films bring.  The children are never talked down to and are treated with respect and love at the same time.  The adults are not dumbed down or stereotyped either. Once again, highly recommended for all ages.	5.0	Wonderful even with the dubbing.	2005-06-15	5	4	1

It's one of those animated movies that have the power to appeal to both children and adults alike, this movie was originally brought here to the U.S. by Troma in a dubbed version but now Disney has bought the rights into a brand new dub featuring the voices of Elle and Dakota Fanning, Tim Daley and Pat Carrol.This 2-Disc set has sharp picture and sound quality with both the new English dub and the original Japanese language version with subtitles for the first time in America! there's some decent extras like a ""Behind The Microphone Featurette"", Trailers, a full length storyboard presentation of the film and TV Spots.A must have for the animation lover!"	5.0	A Miyazaki classic!	2006-08-17	8	8	0

The animation is not as good as the newest Miyazaki movies, it's definitely a notch below, but my kids loved it. Absolutely loved it, even went out and bought Totoro dolls.I hate it when people praise Miyazaki movies saying they are so great, so artistic, such great plots. The fact is, his best movies have no plots, they are full of nothing, much like Seinfeld was about nothing. My kids love it because the movie is about some undefined furry creature who jumps and a lot of rainwater falls from tree leaves - that is the highlight of the movie. It's about nothing, except little girls (that look the same in each movie) and some weirdness, and that's vintage Miyazaki.	5.0	A typical Miyazaki plot......	2006-06-07	6	1	5

"Miyazaki has proven time and time again that he is, and probably always will be, the greatest animator ever to live. No animator, not even the ""great"" Walt Disney, can boast such a massive amount of utterly amazing work. FromNausicaa of the Valley of the WindtoSpirited Away, Miyazaki's movies have transcended time to become some of the best works of art ever conceived. No one knows how to tell a story quite like Miyazaki, and he proves it with every movie he makes.My Neighbor Totoro is just further proof of this mans guineas. Take the characters fromGrave of the Fireflies (Collector's Edition), make them both girls, and place them in a fun, fantasy movie and this is what you get. Totoro is pretty much a lighthearted, fun, and magical Grave of the Fireflies (both movies were made at the same time). The characters are so much alike it's stunning.This is just one of those movies that almost anyone and everyone can enjoy, from a four year old kid to a ninety year old grandma. There's nothing not to like about this movie, it's just too cute to hate. This movie could melt any heart of stone, and send even the most cynical of us into fits of laughter.

Tiny, fuzzy black balls of soot (""Soot Gremlins"") scatter every nook and cranny of the walls, frightened away only by laughter.  A tall, luscious camphor tree towers above the other trees in the back yard.  And, lastly, the Totoros themselves, absolutely adorable little creatures who look like a cross between a raccoon, rabbit, owl, and guinea pig (a personal bias here, since I used to own one who reminds me so much of the Totoros here), live in this very forest, carrying acorns, making huge trees grow at night, and playing ocarinas on the branches of the trees.  There is even one really BIG Totoro who sleeps under the tree, so cuddlesome and gentle that you'll swear that he's the equivalent of your pet.  Of course, he doesn't just allow Mei to snuggle on his chest.  He lets out thunderous roars, shake the ground by jumping with full force, grins as wide as a Cheshire cat (albeit with warmth and generosity), helps others when they're in trouble, and gives acorns wrapped in bamboo leaves in return for gifts.The story isn't all hearts and flowers, however.  An emotionally charged subplot involving the sisters' ailing mother (shades of Miyazaki's personal life here) gives TOTORO a dramatic edge. This is particularly evident in the third act, when the girls receive a distressing telegram about their mother. Both Satsuki and Mei are extremely traumatized by this as any real child would be if such a situation occurred in their lifetime.  What follows is a tearjerking sequence that builds to a truly happy ending.  This mixture of real-life situations, emotions, and magical discoveries found in your nearest back yard make TOTORO feel authentic (even with its fantasy elements).  One cannot help but find this quality in any of Miyazaki's films, this one included.MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO was not a box office success in either Japan or America, but the film has won over millions of children around the world as well as animation buffs for its gorgeous animation style; the backgrounds are lavishly detailed and imagination is galore in much of the sequences.  (It was KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE that would catapult Miyazaki's animation company, Studio Ghibli, into box office success status.)The movie was originally dubbed into English by Carl Macek and his infamous company, Streamline Pictures in 1993.  Believe it or not, this was one of the ""best"" dubs they've ever produced.  As Disney has acquired the rights for Ghibli's movies, though, it was inevitable that they would produce their own version.  This has infuriated many, but as someone who fell in love with TOTORO with the Mecak version, I have to say that this new Disney production is entertaining in its own right.  The script is a fresh new translation from the original Japanese (clarifying the origin of Totoro's name), and remains faithful to the meaning of Miyazaki's screenplay, despite a few line changes here and there (nothing major, though).At first, I was a little worried about hearing Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, but both ended up captivating me from the start; personally, I think it was great for Disney to cast two actual sisters to play the young girls--it helps their chemistry come alive.  The other actors, including a warm, understated Tim Daly, and delightful Lea Salonga provide similarly top quality work.  My favorite performances?  Pat Carroll, displaying maternal charm and whimsy as Granny (not sounding anything like her most-famous role, Ursula from THE LITTLE MERMAID), and Frank Welker, who does outstanding vocal foley for both Totoro and the Cat Bus.The OP and ED songs retain the same lyrics, but are sung by someone else (Sonya Isaacs), which may please some and annoy others.  (The new OP is a little bit off-color at times; the ED is fairly well handled.)  I'm sure that there will be many who will draw comparisons between the two dubs to the very bitter end, but I think it's great to have more than one adaptation of a beloved story, especially when done by folks who obviously love Miyazaki's works.As far as the long awaited 2-DVD set from Disney goes, the widescreen visual transfer is absolutely gorgeous--Miyazaki's visuals really shine with pristine clarity on the screen, and the Japanese language track features literal subtitles, too.  The extras are the same-old voice talent featurette, storyboards, and trailer we saw on most of the other Disney-Ghibli DVDs; sparse, to say the least, but better than nothing.Folks who want the old dub will obviously flock to the FOX pan & scan DVD, but personally, I'd suggest getting both the FOX and Disney releases--the former for nostalgia, the latter for a more professional sounding upgrade.  Either way, however, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is far from just another kid's story. With a little bit of luck, grown-ups (and those who consider themselves too ""sophisticated"" for cartoons) will enjoy it too."	5.0	Marvelous Miyazaki masterpiece (regardless of whatever language it's watched in).	2003-09-16	2	2	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3SAZBKZ1L4PSX	jon	One of the first Ghibli movies and the first big break for the studio. Defiantly a classic for fans of Miyazaki's work. This movie is shorter than the usual full length movie clocking in at around 85 minutes. But it fills the time well with lovely characters and a memorable soundtrack.Some might find the pace slow. And compared to the later movies like Spirited Away and Howel's Movie Castle, the plot might seem a tad underwhelming. I can understand this but keep in mind that sometimes smaller stories can can convey meaning in a way that bigger and flashier ones can not. There's a message to be interpreted here. Not so much a story. And that's okay.Now this is the Fox dub, which I saw when I was about 9. So I admit I do have nostalgia bias regarding the particular dub. Somehow I recalled the Fox dub as being better than I view it now. Although it is still a fantastic dub (especially for 1988), objectively speaking the Disney dub is just as good.I am partial to what I saw first but it really is a matter of preference.	5.0	My Neighbor Totoro	2013-08-20	1	1	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3UHLJGZ2E84A5	"Jordan Lund ""Jordan"""	I've seen a number of people complain about the English soundtrack and I guess I'm not all that bothered since they thought to include the original Japanese language track and English subtitles. If Dakota Fanning is truly that annoying simply switch over to the sound-track the movie came with.I do deduct a star for less than stellar extra features. Disc 1 contains a very short documentary on the recording of the English sound-track, the original movie trailer, and the opening and closing animation without credits. All that is on disc 2 is the complete storyboards for the movie and a repeat of the English and Japanese soundtracks. While it is interesting watching an entire film in storyboard fashion I can't see it meriting a disc all it's own.In terms of family friendly-ness, some younger kids may be disturbed by the fact that the mother is in a hospital for most of the film, or that the youngest daughter goes missing and it's made to seem as though she has drowned. There's also a fair amount of yelling and screaming which might freak out the more sensitive kids.Parents also might have to explain why it's normal for Japanese families to sit naked in a bathtub together. I'd love to see that conversation in, say, Pat Robertson's house...	4.0	Wonderful children's movie...i	2006-03-08	0	0	0

Now I am excited to see Disney is releasing an improved version of Miyazaki's classic with restored visuals, letterbox and the original japanese soundtrack (as well as new dubs even though the old ones weren't bad).It's sad that Disney took so long to start releasing Miyazaki's movies here in North America but now that they have finally started to fulfill their contract the results have been amazing.  I can't recommend this movie enough to anyone who wants to be entertained in a peaceful and magical way.As you can tell from reading the other reviews here, this movie captivates viewers of all ages.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3L9EHMEM1UW9M	"Joshua Eyre ""LinePlaneVolume"""	A classic film from a classic director, Hayao Miyazaki deserves all of the accolades he receives and more. My Neighbor Totoro is a film that can be enjoyed by all ages for its pure vision of childhood. The characterizations of the 2 female protagonists are sweet and genuine and it's a pleasure to watch their interactions with Totoro and the other wood spirits. The story is not very robust, but it's more about the characters that inhabit this world  and the representation of them. The animation shows great attention to detail and holds up well for its age.I, as with most Japanese animation, encourage it to be viewed with the original Japanese language soundtrack. Although many people seem to dislike reading subtitles, the voice actors in Japan have much less trouble sounding like real people in real situations than most of the poorly chosen big name (or just poorly chosen) American actors who can't seem to do a voice that doesn't sound forced. They can truly make a good movie bad.This will definitely be a movie that I can watch with my (future) kids without having to turn my brain off.	5.0	Great animated film for everyone	2007-01-03	2	1	1

Her mother is in a hospital for an extended stay so May, her older sister and father must make do in the new environment.Right from the start they know things will be different.  First there are the fish in the stream.  Then the acorns in the house.  Then the fuzzy black things that dart into hiding.  But most of all there is the giant camphor tree that seems to be the home of a giant furry spirit known as Totoro.May meets Totoro and becomes friends with the powerful creature.  Eventually her sister also meets Totoro and some of the other strange things in the area.  But things really heat up when May becomes worried about her mother and tries to run off to the hospital.  The whole community unites to search for her and eventually her sister appeals to Totoro for help.This is a wonderful and magical tale filled with spectacular animation.  Its only real weakness is that some of the translations from the Japanese are a little clumsy.

The storyline is not too frightening for very little ones, with no villains. They are a little scared when Totoro roars, but he is ultimately discovered to be a benevolent, helpful and friendly character. My boys learn not to be scared along with the characters of Satsuki and Mei. To me this movie hits the balance of dark and light just perfectly; and also explores sibling relationships and tensions, which my boys can relate to. The movie is beautiful and imaginative.

Then the guy came down to check the printouts with me and he noticed what was on the tv...I remarked how cute it was--and even though it was in Japanese, I could understand what was going on! This guy couldn't stop smiling and then he said, &quot;Guess what I'm printing out?&quot; I went to look, and it was an article on Totoro, written by him! I couldn't believe it! We stood and watched the movie for a few moments and he told me what was going on, and then he asked me out on a date! That was 8.5 years ago and I love him more than ever!

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3PT6PKQUNCA7A	J. T. Entzminger	"A father and his two daughters move into an old house in a large wood to be nearer the hospital where the mother is convalescing from an unspecified illness.  It is quickly apparent the house is haunted, but the teensy spirits don't like noise and commotion (ie, children) and they soon move out.  And that's just the beginning...This show is very japanese, but in a comprehensible way; the house doors slide open and closed, the family bathes together and all sleep on the floor in the same room, the neighbors work in the rice paddies.  It works well as it adds to the alien atmosphere of the show yet grounds it strongly in the real world.  The story is simple, human and relatable for small children, yet deals with serious issues like illness and fear in a mature yet non-graphic manner.  Disney knew kids could handle real life problems and so does Miyazaki.I have shown this to many people of almost all ages.  From the most happy-go-lucky to the most curmudgeonly personalities, I have found no one - not one person - who has not agreed it is a wonderful movie for any age audience.Note on the title:  In the closing credits, one can see the girls' mother reading them The Three Billy Goats Gruff.  The japanese pronunciation of ""troll"" is ""toRoro.""  The title of the movie comes from the youngest girl mispronouncing the word as ""toToro.""

The girls plant a garden for their mother and want it to grow. One night Totoro comes with his two little friends to help the garden. He is carrying an umbrella that he was given by the girls. The simple dance that they perform over the garden brings tears to both my wife and I each time we see this part. This one, like all of Miyazaki's movies should be watched with your children.

It's nice to have something to watch with him that isn't computer animated with song after song ( Totoro is not a musical).

They love how the children interact, and love to see Totoro in all of his glory.My husband and I liked it from the first viewing; however as we watched it again and again, we found ourselves stopping whatever we were doing, sitting down and watching it with our kids. And each time we found something intriguing, endearing or something that we had not noticed yet.I have found that with two loud children, I use subtitles a lot in order to get the gist of the movie. In doing so, I have come across 3 different English subtitles on this movie, and each will give you a different meaning. My husband and I have enjoyed the English subtitles that belong to the Japanese audio immensely, as you get a better idea of what the original intentions were of the film maker (So we use the English Audio with subtitle track 3).As for the voice overs, we have not had an issue with it, as we have not heard the previous English version. I have listened to the Japanese audio, and it's enough.Most important about this movie is the story. Don't let the nay-sayers sway you. This is a wonderful family movie. There is one scene that freaked us out a bit the first time, which is the bath scene. It has a bit of nudity, but it's harmless.

But what was sorely missing from this re-release was a surprising lack of vocal talent. While the supporting cast was great, poor Satsuki and Mei were grossly miscast as Dakota Fanning and Elle Fanning. I wonder if Disney even auditioned children for these roles or just thought to themselves, ""Hey, who is a popular child actor that might bring in money?"" Satsuki (voiced by Dakota Fanning) sounds about 3 or 4 years too young for her age, and half the time she sounds dead. The other half of the time she delivers several of her lines very oddly and inappropriate for the scene that they are in. A good example would be when Satsuki offers an umbrella to Totoro, telling him to hurry and take it because her sister (whom she is carrying) is slipping. Ms. Fanning delivers this line in an excited, almost giddy manner, despite the fact that her character is currently shifting around the weight of a small child on her back. It just sounds odd. And Mei is just plain annoying. Half on Elle Fanning's lines are screeched out in such a high pitch voice it practically makes your ears bleed, and the other half of her lines are, literally, high pitched screams. These two young ladies ruined what would have been a decent dub (with the exception of the newly dubbed Catbus which is also disappointing).My advice to you is to either buy a copy of the original dub of Totoro, or watch it in Japanese if you buy this version."	2.0	Long Awaited, But Highly Disappointing	2006-03-08	10	8	2

I havent seen the movie in years, but immedately i knew there was something wrong. My neighbor totoro IS a great movie, in the original english voice over and if you want to watch it in japanese. This version was redubbed by Disney and much of the dialog has been changed and all the magic is Gone. The original voices actually sound like voice acting with real emotion. The characters all sound like their literally reading everything off of a prompter with zero emotion or feeling which ruins it I think anyone could have done better voice acting, Honestly its like watching a totally different movie, its a night and day difference. Even totoros voice is different. The last time i saw this movie it aired on cartoon network and was heart moving. I'm sad Disney ruined such a great film.Moral of the story is they NEED to add another voice option of the original voice acting. Words cannot describe how watching this new version has totally destroyed such a great childhood memory. It makes me sick.	1.0	Great movie, HORRIBLE VERSION, DO NOT BUY!!!	2013-12-21	10	6	4
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2ERQV6GQ9ZSOC	Katrina Maree	I bought this movie, super excited to share it with my son. Growing up, I LOVED this movie, and I couldn't wait to see it again. I put it in my PS3 and got excited to sing the intro song...when I realized it was different. I assumed it was just a newer change and didn't let it bother me too much...until the dialogue for the movie began. &#34;Hello there! Looks like we're going to be neighbors!&#34; translates into something like &#34;Hi, we are the whatever family. We are moving in next door. You have beautiful property. You should come over for dinner sometime so we can get to know each other. It was nice getting to meet you. Farewell.&#34; This is not verbatim and might be slightly over-exaggerated, but still, it is RIDICULOUS! Why did Disney take a wonderful classic and ruin it with their garbage translations, new music, and sound effects?!?! They even changed the sound of Totoro's yawn? WHY??!?!?!?!?!!! I was so upset I traded this in and purchased the original copy. Don't buy this, unless you enjoy watching garbage. Shame on you Disney!	1.0	This is NOT Totoro!	2013-12-18	9	4	5

She loved this movie and even asked to see it again when it was done!  My 3-year old also loves the movie.  She finds many of the Disney movies too frightening.  This movie has a slower pace than the newer Disney movies and a calmer feel.  The kids just loved it and burst out laughing many times.  As an adult, I don't think I would watch it too often but it was enjoyable.  I have not seen the Fox version and I found the voice acting fine.  The ""celebrity"" voices did not distract from the movie.  Tim Daly's voice was the only one that I recognized.  I thought that the kids voices were well done, especially the younger girl (Elle Fanning).  It was very true to what a 3 or 4-year old would sound like."	5.0	Entertaining movie, great for young kids	2010-11-08	3	3	0

I was hoping for an older version of the movie before the wording was fixed. Personally I find the mess ups in the script translation makes the children sound more like children. Overall I did not like the adjusted script nor the actors they chose for the voices. However, I saw the old version first so my opinion may be biased.	2.0	My Neighbor Totoro	2010-06-29	4	3	1

I can't stand the redone version because they changed the dialogue a lot and I didn't find it quite as cute and entertaining. If you haven't seen the original, it won't really matter to you, but trying to go from it to the newer one is a major disappointment.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1LKYHAK5VGWTQ	K_Duffer	First, let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of &quot;My Neighbor Totoro and the works of Miyazaki.  I will let the other reviews speak to the merits of the film.Having said that, I could not have been more disappointed with this DVD.  Here are some of my complaints:1.  No letterbox!  I want to see the whole movie in its full glory, not cut up to fit our television screen space.  On the cut version is presented on the DVD.  Maybe some people would prefer non-letterbox--if so, why not offer both?2.  No Japanese!  Another major flaw in the presentation is that there is no language option where you can listen to the original Japanese voices with subtitles.  Considering this is a DVD, both options should have been offered.3.  No extra materials!  How about some extra content, including some pre-production drawings?  Or some information regarding the original production.I am glad that this movie has been released in the U.S., but shame on Fox for producing such a shoddy product.  I think consumers have come to expect certain features to be available on a DVD that is not available on VHS.  The three things mentioned above are very simple things that would have tremendously improved the quality of the movie.I would recommend the movie highly to anyone who have not seen it.  However, I have to rate the DVD only 3 stars because of the lack of content.	3.0	Great Movie, But Disappointing DVD	2003-01-31	107	88	19
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A32NNNII7ZW160	"K. Durance ""biblioholic"""	Yes, I agree with my fellow reviewers in saying that I think the movie itself is practically perfect, filled with beauty, joy, wonder and hope.  However, the DVD was indeed put together very poorly.  The extras were only previews of old children's movies (one of them from when I was a kid 20 years ago).  I would have liked a widescreen option and also the option to view it in the original Japanese with English subtitles, not to mention any possible extras, about the movie, in English.  I think it was still worth buying and I would buy a better DVD again if it existed.  Also, my nearly three year old daughter loves this movie as much as I do and watches it over and over with great enthusiasm.	3.0	Wonderful Movie, Crummy DVD	2003-05-09	6	6	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2CS1K8JTWZH04	Kelly From Seattle	"The film is simply great. The 'behind the scenes' special features in this edition were really great to watch. Since the film came out back in the 1980's, it is really nice to get a fresh perspective from the creator and his team.It is a simple, innocent story of a family during (allegedly) the 1950's in Japan. Mom is sick, and in essentially a quarantine/isolated hospital unit.Her husband and two daughters move out to the country to live near her while she recovers. The father is a professor at the local University, and very preoccupied with his studies and, quite obviously, his ill wife.The film is a fantastic story of the sisters discovery of their neighbor 'Totoro', a big furry awesome character that lives 'next door'.They have some great moments and some tremendous adventures. The true story is really about the daughters dealing with the uncertainty of their mothers condition, moving to a new town and dealing with a new school all the while discovering new friendships and dealing with hardship simultaneously. It does a great job of showing just how creative kids are, and also makes you think twice about your own inability to believe in the fantastic as an adult. It perfectly captures the transitional period between being an innocent child and the wonderful discovery of a world that is much more than you ever imagined.The english Voice Overs by the Fanning sisters is superb. The rest of the english cast does a bang-up job as well. Some of the very non-western ideas sound a bit funny coming out of two kids speaking english, but it's not a distraction. It's great front to back, and the extra features were a treat to watch. I'm a fan of Hayao Miyazaki without question, but even a casual viewer will love this film. Do the kids a favor and pick this up. Do yourself a favor and watch it after the kids go to bed and be transported back in time to when you were in that same impressionable time.Now, while the box may LOOK like a Blu-ray movie, it is not. I take issue with folks dressing up ""special edition"" boxes to look like the familiar Blu-ray boxes. This has no bearing on the film, but the packaging sure looks like it is trying to pass itself off as a Blu-ray."	5.0	Great Film!

I came across this by sheer accident and my was introduced to a world of animation that I never knew existed.I feel kinda stupid gushing so, but this movie has such a great story, with weird, fascinating Japanese spirits and characters, gorgeous and lush animation and if all that wasn't enough, it gives great insight into Japanese rural lifestyle and culture, from a intimate look at country house, to food, to the Japanese family bath, this movie has got it all.The story is about two young girls whose mother is in the hospital with a serious illness that prevents her from being home with her daughters. The father and the girls move to the country at the start of the picture. At their new (older) house, they discover spirits or dust sprites (cute,small, black and round) living upstairs and with the help of an elderly neighbor (who is kind of scary looking at first, but after seeing a few of these Japanese animated movies, we've gotten used to and even appreciate the accurate depiction of the wrinkly old faces complete with a large mole or two) they learn a bit about spirits. These spirits come in all shapes and sizes and eventually befriend the girls and assist them when a small family crisis occurs.A wonderful, refreshing look at family life, a great movie for everyone.	5.0	You'll Forget It's Animation . . .	2003-03-14	0	0	0

I thanked her, apprehensively at first, not really knowing much about the flick, and tossed it in the DVD player. My daughter was instantly smiling as the opening credits rolled...yes, even the beginning theme song is fun!I found myself being sucked into this movie, much like the first time I saw ET. The characters, Mei especially, were just so incredibly sincere and likable. I love the fact that the two sisters were so brave and had so much heart. My favorite scene, the bus stop, is just so magical. It's great to finally see a family movie that's truly a FAMILY movie.Now don't get me wrong, I love Tarantino flicks too, but Totoro is just about as perfect as it gets when it comes to a perfect family movie...it just blows away all of the American animated G-rated movies of late. In fact, I'd even say it's one of the better G-rated movies of all-time.	5.0	Totally suprised by how much I liked this movie!!!	2007-03-30	3	3	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3SCM4PYAI80S4	K. Herriott	I remember being under ten years old, and going to the grocery store with my mother. And there, they had a small movie section of VHS you could rent. My mother always fought tooth and nail with me because I would always rent My Neighbor Totoro, the FOX version all the time. I grew up with the FOX version, back then, being so young I did not care about extra's etc because back then DVD's were not around yet. I loved this movie, and it is my #1 favorite. I can always put it in and never tire of it. Totoro is nothing short of Amazing, colorful, magical and displays a sense of visual simplicity that engulfs you and mesmerizes any viewer. I more then love this movie. About 2 years ago, we had an anime store near us, that rented out dvds. When I heard Disney was going to be releasing Totoro I was excited! Because I even remember thinking back on all the other Miyazaki films Disney had done, and wondered if they would ever do Totoro. When the anime store got it in, I rented it and came home, popped the disk in, and I could not make it past the scene where Mei and Satsuki are hopping on the rocks around a small pond when they are exploring their new home. I could not finish watching it. I hated it. It almost seems like the Fanning sisters are trying to hard to me, from what I heard of the DVD though it was very little. The voices of Mei and Satsuki in the FOX version did the voices with such fluent simplicity. It sounded more natural, and I think its because I'd grown up on the FOX version that I will never be able to watch any other version, including the Disney version. I'm now nearing 23, and this movie with always captivate me every time I watch it. I'm going to get the Japanese version DVD, because I have yet to watch this in its original dialogue, something I've wanted to do every since I came into Japanese animation.My advice, if you have the FOX version, even though it may be bad quality and no extras, which I totally agree with, if anything appreciate it for the dubbing voices. Overall better then Disney's portrayal in every way shape and form. If I ever bought this DVD it would only be for the Japanese dialogue.One of my favorite movies of all time.

I babysit for the 2 year old daughter of my best friend, and when it's raining outside, or the world has us a little blue, ""Totoro"" is a movie we both enjoy. Great in its own right, there's NOTHING like watching the face of a young child light up when the cat bus appears.The DVD - unfortunately - is of inferior quality. There is apparently no widescreen version, no choice of Japanese with sub-titles (which is how I prefer to watch Japanese films, as with all releases in other languages). There are no extras, but extras aren't usually my selling point.I highly recommend this movie - as well as ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" - to parents who are looking for something beyond ""Bob the Builder"" to share with their children.

We're lucky enough to live next to a 100-acre wood and our walks in it are enhanced by his hopes of seeing a ""Totoro"" under every tree. Miyazaki-san is unarguably the greatest genius working in children's animation today, and his visions are both sweet and richly detailed about the complicated relationships between humans and nature, light and dark, love and fear. Don't hesitate to enjoy this film in whatever format you can find. There are some loud noises, but otherwise it's totally suitable for small children. Kids over 4 or 5 might feel some concern for Satsuki's fears about her mother, but those are put into a warm and reassuring context.

Disney, as wonderful as they are, could learn much from this film.  The character development is far  superior to most Disney flicks, but what really distinguishes this film is  how imaginative it is.  The bus stop scene is five of the most enchanting  and beautiful mintutes of film I have ever seen.  It is hard to tell who  loved it more, me or my four and six year old children, or my wife.	5.0	Disney could learn much from this film...	1999-04-18	1	1	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1FR9IISI2M6EP	Kyle R. Schlichter	I'm of two minds about FOX's Totoro release.  On the one hand, this is truly one of the great animated classics of our time, a fun, beautiful, and imaginative story, sure to be enjoyed by children from pre-school to post-grad. ;)  I highly recommend it to any parents with young children, as it is very easily enjoyed by both parents and kids watching together.On the other hand, as a serious collector of Miyazaki's work, I find the release to be slightly substandard.  Full-screen-only, dub-only, and lacking in the neat special features that highlight Disney's releases, this film might disappoint the serious viewer.In short: if you have kids, buy it, and buy it soon.  But if you want the best, most collectable and complete version of this film, import the Region 2 DVD.	4.0	A modern classic	2003-12-04	9	9	0

This version of Totoro really stinks!!!! Almost to the point of ruining the entire film for me. I couldn't suffer through it when the movie premiered on TCM. Let me explain there was a previoulsy released edition that was put out by Fox which is the best. The english dubbing on the Disney version is horrific. The characters are so off from the original release. Please if you are considering adding this dvd to your collection go with the original fox edition. You are missing out on so much of the movie if you only see this Lame version put out by Disney.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2MVOYPF6I2TZR	Lauren Countess	"Back last year (2006) I found the 'Fox' release of this AMAZING movie in the $7.99 bin at a walmart. I grew up watching Totoro with my Grandma and watching it in all its original glory was special because she has since passed and it brought back the memories of spending time with her at her house -- then I loaned it to a friend who won't give it back. Of course the 'Fox' dvd went out of print but ""Oh joy!"" it was re-released by Disney. Needless to say, I bought the Disney ""remastered"" version 2 disc thing for a whopping $25 and I have to say... IM SO DISSAPOINTED! Why oh WHY did they think re-dubbing the voices was needed? I really dislike the new dub. Its an abomination and insults the original. If you've seen the original, DO NOT BUY THIS. You will be pretty sad w/ Dakota & Elle Fannings voice acting. At times I even muted it because it was just so far from the original and way annoying. If you can get your hands on the 'Fox' release of the movie... DO. However, if you have never seen this movie or have young kids who have not, don't pass this up. It is an amazing piece of film with a great story and having not seen it you won't have anything to judge it against. For long time fans of the original, don't bother.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AH4BFQT131MEN	Lawrence J. Keel	My Neighbor Totoro is one of the greatest animated films ever produced (for children or otherwise). It is a film that devoted fans such as myself love sharing with children and friends (I even teach it in my Children's Literature class.)----The delicacy of Hayao Miyazaki's tale of two young girls who must cope with the stresses of moving to a new house, neighborhood and school--while their mother is kept in a hospital for a problem they do not understand!--is extraordinarily well-told through delightful and surprising events and beautiful animation. That the girls need the friendship and support of their father, the neighbors and the Totoros (friendly nature spirits) is subtly presented and then heroically answered through Miyazaki's unforgettable imagery.---But you'll have to trust me on that because a good portion of that imagery has been butchered away through the pan-and-scan process. Not only have the producers of this DVD version cut away much of the visuals but they have also left off the Japanese language track and given us a rather pale transfer.----English speaking kids deserve to see this better-than-Disney film. They deserve to view the widescreen version and they deserve the option of hearing the dubbed version (if they cannot yet read) OR hearing it in it's original language while reading subtitles. A quality production would offer these things and more.----This DVD offers a Masterpiece, but a badly Mistreated one----	2.0	Fantastic Animation -- Unforgivable Treatment	2003-02-21	16	14	2

Of course it doesn't come set up to automatically play that version, because we ARE in the U.S. after all, and most folks want their animation in English... it's just a set up on the DVD.

I want him to live in the tree in my neighbor's yard. This film almost doesn't need the subtitles, the animation and emotion of the characters is so strong, it translates.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1JTOBODFHVJPG	"Legacyman77 ""uuuhhh7"""	"O that I could have had a heart attack just before I had seen this version, so that I could leave this world ignorant of the horrors of Disney's re-release. I have so many complaints about this version that I can't count them all, but for now I'll stick with the biggest ones: Voice-Acting, Music, Sound Effects, and Translations.First off voice-acting was just plain horrible. Not only that, but I kept wanting to turn the sound down, because every syllable seemed to be screamed at me. The voices don't even seem to fit the way the characters look. I remember watching the original American release as a kid of about 5 or 6, and even then thinking that the voices fit, but now...Now the music is just as bad, if not worse than the voices. I found that you kept hearing the same four measures, over and over throughout the entire movie. In my opinion there was also way too much emphasis on the strings. A good score needs contrast, especially if it's a score to a Japanese movie, which already has a different feel than an American one.Along the same lines are the sound effects, which are very (though thankfully not completely) different, from the original. A great example is when Satsuke is waiting with Totoro for the bus. In the original you could hear how hard the rain was coming down, but now there are just a few highlighted drops here and there.Lastly the translation is much worse than the original release. Many words are either added, changed, or dropped for no apparent reason. I guess that's what you get for buying a Disney movie. Yet another thing that bothered me about the translating, was that they kept calling Satsuke as ""Satsuki."" (Just one of my pet peeves. I hate when foreigners change pronunciations of words in other languages, when the original is just fine.)In conclusion I will say to all of you who are looking to buy this DVD to, recapture the magic you found when watching the original as a kid, buy the FOX DVD, and skip this one. The only redeeming quality of this version is that it has the original Japanese, but that hardly compensates for the rest."	1.0	How can a movie be this bad?	2006-04-13	14	7	7
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1EEG7YJIYN60B	Lesley Aeschliman	My Neighbor Totoro is a film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and it was released in Japan in 1988.  There was a American release of this film in 1993 by Fox Video, but they lost the rights to the film in 2004.  Disney acquired the rights and produced a new English dub with new voice actors.  Disney released this DVD in 2006.The film tells the story of two girls and their father, and their move into a new house in order to be closer to the girls' mother (who is sick and in this hospital).  Over the course of the movie, the girls encounter such magical creatures as the soot sprites, Totoro, and the Catbus.While the film clocks in at under 90 minutes, it's stil la very enjoyable film.  To be honest, I think if Miyazaki had tried to make the film any longer, it would have weakened the story.  This is a very family-friendly anime film, and I would highly recommend it.  While I'm a little disappointed in the special features, I still enjoy the story and the film itself.	4.0	A short, but sweet film by Hayao Miyazaki	2008-06-04	3	3	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2MJNQBZLAG9PC	Library Kat	I love this anime and am waiting for the Disney/Buena Vista release for the Japanese language version.  I lived in Japan during the early 1960s, so much in the film reflects the country I knew as a child.  As for those reviewers worrying about the bath scene - get over it.  It's completely innocent.  I used to bathe like that with my grandfather and my grandmother, and sometimes with my parents.  They didn't bother with any false modesty based on prudish ideas.  When I first saw that scene, I felt no worry or upset, but warm nostalgia.  I talked with my sons about it, and how things were back then, and they haven't become twisted.The Japanese countryside really did used to look like Miyazaki's backgrounds; my grandmother used to wear the same kind of over-all apron when she cooked.  I will often watch the anime just to remember back to my childhood and the Japan I remember.  I don't know of any other film that so truly captures the joys (and heartaches) of being a child as well as My Neighbor Totoro does.	5.0	True Japanese culture of the mid-20th century	2006-02-03	12	11	1

The Disney version has the same visuals but a different translation and voice actors. I now prefer the Disney version, but this was a great substitute for years until Disney negotiated to produce the English-language versions for Studio Ghibli.)This film has been a favorite in our family since my children were very young. They even loved it in Japanese (even though they couldn't understand it) before this English version was released! There is no scary or disturbing violence. Instead, it offers delightful characters and imaginative creatures in an original story that also introduces children to aspects of the Japanese culture. And of course there's the beautiful animation. Hayao Miyazaki is a favorite of mine, and this is his best film for children. It's our favorite gift because we know if we loan out our copy, we won't see it again for a long time!	5.0	Delightful, original, non-violent film for children & adults	1998-12-12	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A106ZCP7RSXMRU	"Lil MamaKitty ""lilbit565"""	I don't understand the glowing reviews. We loved Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service was sweetly enjoyable, and because this is another highly-rated Miyazaki film, we bought My Neighbor Totoro. Based on the reviews, we expected to be amazed and enthralled. Instead we found ourselves watching a strange, convoluted story with a Pokemon-type charactor who is never explained. (Nothing against Pokemon, we enjoyed that series.) Unlike Spirited Away, where the strange creatures 'belonged' in that world and had a purpose, the ones in this movie never really make sense. In Spirited Away, we believe that this world could exist, the story slowly unfolds with questions answered as we go, the characters are developed so we want to know them, and actually care about them. By contrast, in My Neighbor Totoro, there are both magical and human characters that float through but never really get developed. Very little is explained, ever, and the result feels empty. There are inconsistencies that make no sense: on the one hand, only the children can see the magical cat-bus, but when the father glances out the window and sees his children perched high in the top of a magic tree with the creature Totoro, Dad just chuckles with amusement and continues to work. It feels like an episode of an anime series that you really needed to watch from the beginning to get into it, and it ends with a 'to be continued' type of plot. While visually beautiful, what is offered here is not, in itself, enough to be a self-contained story, there is not enough to develop an emotional connection with anyone -- not really even the main characters! -- and we are left with the feeling that it is pointless. No doubt this DVD will only collect dust in our collection. I give this 2 stars only for the lovely animation, which is truly beautiful. If you want a masterpiece of a story along with exquisite animation, buy the genius Spirited Away instead of this dud.	2.0	Unimpressive	2009-08-20	15	3	12

I was pretty excited to see that I could buy it online, because you can't find this movie in stores anywhere, but I was INCREDIBLY disappointed when I recieved it and put it in my DVD player. This movie is a remake of the orignal, and God knows why they would ruin it. The only difference is different voice actors, but like I said, I fell in love with the original and hearing the ""celebrity's"" voices instead of the originals was just wrong. I guess it would be alright if you had never seen this movie before, because you wouldn't notice a thing, but right from the start I knew something was wrong. The voices are all wrong, and I wouldn't be so upset about it, except that it isn't written anywhere that says its a remake. I don't understand why they felt the need to remake a perfectly fine movie anyway. I was looking for the original, and it's not what I got. I just wish it would have been said somewhere on the site or the box that it ISN'T THE ORIGINAL FILM. True, it does say the names on the front of the box, but I had never known the original names so I didn't notice a thing when I bought it. So seriously, if you're looking to rekindle childhood memories, don't buy this version!"	1.0	Misleading Title	2010-07-12	14	5	9
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2T7TZBOTP68C7	"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart"""	Japanese animated filmaker Hayao Miyazaki has a deep and abiding love of nature, and of the Japanese Shinto spirits who live deep in the forest.  Miyazaki shares this love in this wonderful film about two young girls who go to live with their father in a country house in rural Japan, far removed from the city lights of Tokyo.One of Miyazaki's gifts is how he captures the mannerisms of children, especially little girls.  The boisterous innocence of how the sisters laugh and play, however, does not mean they are not capable of deep sensitivity.  Indeed, the serious part of this story is that their mother is sick in a hospital.The new house and new neighbors provide many adventures for the girls, who soon discover the friendly and magical Shinto spirits who dwell in the nearby woods.  Like an old-fashioned European fairy-tale, the spirits, who would normally be hidden, respond to the girl's kindness.  One especially memorable scene happens when the girls are waiting at the rural bus stop for their father to come home from visiting his wife.From a summer sky suddenly dark and about to burst with rain, to a slow setting of the sun, the animation in Totoro is amazing in it's simplicity.  The quiet nature scenes are extremely relaxing for adults, who will become nostalgic for their childhood while viewing this classic.One scene is deeply moving and speaks of the bonds that can form between people who aren't even related.  It is of an old woman praying fervently for the little sister, who has become lost while trying to find her way to her mother.  This scene, and the climactic ending, will touch your heart.	4.0	Totoro : A Delightul Neighbor	2004-06-09	0	0	0

Even though the ""baby"" of our family is turning ten, all of us still watch the movie together. Anybody with small children between the ages of 3 and 8 should get this one. My daughter and son watched this one almost daily for months on end. My daughter made drawings of the cat bus with all of us inside. It is one of the few movies I can sit down with them and watch and not be annoyed (I have a hard time sitting through many so-called children's movies because something or other will irritate me- like the sterotypes used, rudeness factor, too adult preoccupations with what villians should look like and behave.) The other movies we love are Spirited Away and Kiki's Devilery Service. Let you children watch this before they get too used to the hyper-active, sub-standard and crude fare they will be watching later one. This film lets them be little children rather than brainwashed consumers of animated ""comercials"" and kiddie sitcoms."	5.0	love it!	2009-10-13	2	2	0

I was only interested in this movie because of Hayao Miyazaki, having seen Spirited Away and falling in love with it. Once you understand that the originating language was not English, you can see how difficult it is to make English dialogue fit in properly.  English does tend to sound American quite often, heh, and, English speaking children relate to it, I believe.It's too bad that in the first page on Amazon, the negative reviews pull up toward the top. I know there's a programming reason for that, but, isn't it sad that there's always a focus on criticism.Try this and form your own opinion and I think 99% of viewers will just LOVE it.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2XVQJF0GC14PN	Maddimom	"very nice to have little girls as the primary characters.  Well written dynamic between the sisters, showing how a big sister tends to look out for her younger siblings, and how very young children feel about being told what to do.  The magical world and characters that the girls discover at their summer home is a great connection to the imaginary play that I see in the younger children.  Its a little long for the little ones(3- 4.5 yrs) but my 5 year old enjoys the whole movie on an indoor day or long trip.  We watched Sprirted Away first, another great movie, but its not really for little ones (some ""scary"" characters and a separation from parents).In this movie, the girls' are concerned about their mother who is recuperating, but that is not the focus of the story, and I think its good to present the idea that little kids could sometimes have an ill or recuperating parent.

Even my 20-month old daughter could immediately tell the difference, and she insists on the Fox version! If you hear the original dubbing, you will NOT want to buy the Disney version. True, the new release is visually stunning (digitally enhanced animation) but after a while what sticks with you is the audio quality and it's definitely NOT worth it. The songs and the script were completed re-done and are so bland and lifeless! Disney took the heart and soul out of this script, even with the start-studded cast. Having watched this movie over 100 times (it's my daughter's favorite film), the new script dialogue is so dull and the actors sounded like they were just reading aloud. Dakota and Elle Fanning may be little girls in real life but they were awful at animation voiceovers. The grown-up cast wasn't any better... totally dull as dishwater... Are critics just afraid of panning Disney and it's big-named cast?!  I can't believe I paid money for this one... and it was even more expensive than the Fox version.  In fact, I will buy an extra Fox version (before it is discontinued!) because my daughter watches it so much, it's sure to wear out.	2.0	This Disney version has NO magic -- check out the original Fox  version instead coz it's 10x bettter!	2006-05-01	12	10	2

It began to play, and I was ready to revisit an old childhood favorite, when I heard different voices coming out of the familiar characters mouthes! I now know that Disney got their grubby hands on a beloved classic, and disgustingly re-dubbed it. I am desperate to find a DVD copy with the ORIGINAL English dubbing, and would like to know if this is it.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q	"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;"""	It is depressing to have thoroughly enjoyed a film or book, and find that it is has become fashionable to pan the work because of the packaging and skip over its contents.  That Fox chose to treat 'My Neighbor Totoro' as a children's film, fitting it into the television aspect ratio and providing dubbing that was aimed at that audience, will displease some purists.  However, it isn't going to displease many children who suddenly have access to a beautiful work with strong positive values and a marvelous insight into Japanese culture.  Speaking as overweight, over aged child, it didn't displease me either.  If you are a purist, however, be warned.  This is a production intended to be viable at the price of a children's video.  If you are expecting the benefits of a general audience DVD, you will be disappointed.Satsuki (10), Mei (5), and their father have moved into a rural setting so that they can be close to their mother, who is ill (tuberculosis?), and is resting at a nearby hospital.  The film talks about the girls experiences, mundane and magical as they wait for the time when their mother can return.  Part of writer/director Hayao Miyazaki's brilliance is in not turning this into a tragic story or morbid story.  Instead, we see the children's excitement in their new home, and the close affection that interpenetrates their family life.  Only then does Miyazaki introduce the theme of the mother's illness.  This helps us to keep focused on the children's strength, rather than any sense of impending doom.When Mei chases a strange animal that looks like a cross between a rabbit and a teddy bear into the woods, she falls down a hole (just like Alice) and find a giant fluffy creature called a Totoro, who may or may not be 'the lord or the forest,' but in short order is the lord of our hearts.  The Totoro is magic at its best, soft enough to sleep on, able to fly about the forest, grow giant trees and summon a cat bus that will always take you where you need to go.  As a child's imaginary playmate should be, the Totoro is playmate, friend, and protection.  For the two children, the Totoro and its other spirit friends are the creatures that shout love, the powers that keep things from falling apart.The film is quite honest about the feelings of these children as they cope with their own fears for their mother.  It is rare that a film speaks genuinely for children in this predicament, and attempts to set an effective coping model.  This is special.  It lifts the story to the level where it has something important to say to such children without making it the least bit preachy.  In thinking over the film, I find that what is really magic isn't the Totoro's amazing powers, but the relations between the human characters.  They are many and all think nothing of helping each other and sharing.  Perhaps the real message isn't about Totoro's that live in trees, but the Totoro's that live in our hearts and the hearts of our friends.  Highly recommended.	5.0	&quot;He plays a magic flute in the sky&quot;	2003-01-10	126	102	24

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2DZLDYIOCQQFH	Mattx28025	"Let me start off by saying I am huge supporter of Studio Ghibli and Mr. Miyazaki. I was incredibly pleased to hear that Totoro was finally getting a widescreen 2-disc edition and the recognition it deserves...but sadly I was appalled by this release. Dakota Fanning is by-far the worst kid actor in Hollywood and has the worst possible voice to grace an english dub for a Miyazaki film. She can't even pronounce ""Satsuki"" properly. I recently got a hold of a Studio Ghibli Collection which I'm sad to say I found out was bootlegged, but nontheless It has the Fox version of Totoro in widescreen and is 178% better than the Disney release. Like I said before I love all the other Disney dubs of Miyazaki's films...Nausicaa is amazing, Whisper of the Heart..incredible, and Howl's Moving Castle is the one of the best english dubs I've ever heard as Christian Bale was incredible as Howl. As for little Ms. Fanning her lines felt so forced and fake in the 30 mins I watched this and came to grips with knowing I just wasted $25 on this set, but I still have the Fox version...one I will cherish forever as I watch it every couple of weeks and I'm 22.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	ATP9LYGM6D3RO	"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan"""	"""My Neighbor Totoro"" is one of those rare films that defies easy catagorization. While clearly aimed at pre-teens, Miyazaki manages to bring the rest of us along for this pure, fantasy adventure. While I believe ""Spirited Away"" is his best work, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is certainly his most iconic and perhaps most loved.I'll leave the joys of the film itself for you to discover as I will focus my review on the presentation and contents of this two-disc DVD release.The film is presented in it's proper widescreen aspect ratio, but I am somewhat puzzled as to why Disney chose not to release a ""Blu-Ray"" version as well like Miyazaki's latest movie ""Ponyo"". Considering the sumptuos visions of bright, blue skies above lush trees, I would think a Blu-Ray version would be a must, but perhaps there were challenges beyond Disney and Studio Ghibli's control that prevents a top-notch Blu-Ray edition.You can choose to listen to the original Japanese language, but the ""English"" version featuring the Fanning sisters (Dakota and Elle) with Tim Daly (""Wings"") works well.Disc Two contains the special feature. Several videos documenting the creation of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" through the ""Behind the Microphone"" section featuring the aforementioned American actors are well produced and informative. However, they are all presented separately and cannot be played all at once. This is somewhat disappointing since some of the videos last only a few minutes.The ""Original Japanese Storyboards"" presents the film's audio track while showing the original storyboards. A wonderful touch for those especially interested in the process of animation.""Enter the Lands"" allows you to access the ""worlds"" of four Miyazaki films, ""Totoro"", ""Ponyo"", Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Castle in the Sky"". They are designed for children as the ""Totoro"" one asks questions to decide what character you are most like. While the others feature all their main characters in a ""promotional"" kind of way.Interestingly enough, on the main page of ""Enter the Lands"" we also see characters from other Miyazaki's films like ""Princess Mononoke"", but they cannot be accessed.Also included are the standard Disney printed ads and a lithograph on a roughly 4 x 8 postcard that duplicates the DVD cover. At first glance it appears to be lifted from the famous ""bus stop"" scene but the ""girl"" is not either one of the sisters. Perhaps this was from a special poster created to promote the movie?All in all this is a fine DVD set for all ages that I heartily recommened."	5.0	One of Miyazaki's best...	2010-03-08	3	3	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2ZT24V9CVIQ21	MCM	I agree with the reviewer below. I was holding out on purchasing this film on VHS, wanting it on DVD instead. I was excited when Amazon.com alerted me to this release. I expected it to be the same as the marvelous 2DVD, Region 2 release with full-screen presentation, bi-lingual audio and subtitles and an extra DVD full of special features. I was extremely disappointed in receiving this full-screen, pan-and-scan version with only an English audio voice track! No special features! The folks who released this should be ashamed. Miyazaki deserves better...	1.0	Also Very Disappointed	2002-12-26	28	24	4
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	ACZYPXGXGJ2K2	M. C. Myers	Princess Mononoke was the first Miyazaki movie I'd seen, and is perhaps my favorite (close call between it at Spirited Away). But having come to the director by way of a film rivaling the best of Kurasawa in its epic scale, its always refreshing to see how Miyazaki is able to excel in telling more intimate (yet still magical and fantastical) stories of children learning to accept the adult responsibilities that come with growing up.In films like Kiki's Delivery Service and the recent Spirited Away, children start their journey through adulthood by dealing with problems allegorical to those the children watching the film face or will face themselves. My Neighbor Totoro, which is partly autobiographical (Miyazaki's mother battled TB), presents a real problem, an ailing parent, more directly, but demonstrates the same sensitivity he does when using witchcraft and spirits to metaphorically approach children's anxieties. The plot is straightforward enough: Two young girls explore their new home, discovering the enchanted creatures that share the house and the encircling forests, while waiting for their mother to recover from her illness and be discharged from the hospital. The mother's absence from their new house is not ignored, nor is it a dark cloud constantly hovering over the proceedings. The children live their life in their enchanted new land, but they also think of their mother and anxiously await her return.Miyazaki of course includes the magical creatures and fantasy one expects from him, but ultimately his goal is just to tell a simple story, capturing emotions all children can relate to on some level. Unfortunately, Miyazaki seems to pull the reigns too tightly on the fantastical elements of this film. Of course, My Neighbor Totoro has spirits and magical catbuses and all, but they don't rate much screen time; the girls are the ones that must carry the film. And Satsuki and Mei aren't really interesting enough for that burden. The totoros are cute, and the catbus is amusing, though a little creepy. But somehow the balance between these magical creatures and the human children they are there to delight seems off here, compared to Miyazaki's other films.Ultimately, I'm not sure that this film is inferior to Miyazaki's other work. I just think this is one case where the film is aimed at children, and they primarily will enjoy it. Adults will, too (I did), but if you're expecting something as delightful as Kiki's Delivery Service, or on the scale of Princess Mononoke, you might be disappointed.	3.0	A more youth-aimed effort by Miyazaki	2004-03-09	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A370Z6I5GBWU44	"M ""Delicious Strawberry"""	Like any Hayao Miyazaki movie, you just can't go wrong with this. Rather than big guns and good guys vs bad guys, this is a sweet and poignant movie with just the right amount of sentimentality and magic, and overall is a wonderful, fuzzy movie (literally and figuratively)The cat-bus was one of the weirdest things I've ever seen, but I certainly wouldn't mind riding on these soft, fuzzy seats. The movie has a bit of sadness to balance all the fuzziness (Mom and her chronic illness) but there's nothing overly graphic or depressing, so in the end, the movie is delivered successfully. If you're a fan of Miyazaki and his work, then this movie is a definite must-see. The one scene I remember most is the little sister exploring the house her family moved into, and looking into a hole in the wall when BAM! all of these black, fuzzy things explode out. Goodness, if that happened to me, I'd probably have a heart attack. It was pretty funny.	5.0	Sweet and awesome	2010-10-20	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1FJCJJ6YLIU2K	"M. Derby ""drone45"""	"Yes, the ""extras"" are poor.  The dubbing is substandard.Nevertheless, this long-awaited release is well worth owning.  Even if only for the opportunity to view this classic film as it should always be presented:  in true widescreen.The only time I switched to the English-language audio was during the opening and ending sequences, so I could hear the singing in English.  Odd that some of the credits are subtitled, but the most entertaining aspect--the lyrics--were not.After that, I had no interest in hearing anything but the Japanese soundtrack.  From the subtitles, I can understand the dialogue.  But to hear only the dubbed soundtrack is to ignore the original performances.  Even the most sympathetically created dubbing inevitably obscures the intonation and emotional nuances created by the actors, guided by the director:  these are (at least) as important to the rendering of character as the visuals.Only those fluent in Japanese are capable of fully comprehending every aspect of the work.  With subtitles, some meaning is altered, but less so than if one is hearing Hollywood actors pretending to be Japanese characters.Even with my limited understanding, I could detect a few moments when the subtitles seemed not to be faithful to the script.  But unless the translation is extremely poor, I prefer subtitles.If another version's soundtrack dubbed in English is superior,  many parents of small children will seek it.  I've stated my opinion.  But I don't intend to impose it as the one and only way, nor to spoil anyone else's enjoyment of the movie.  The more choices, the better.It rankles, a bit, to read the back-cover copy:  ""...one of the most delightful and charming family films ever...""  I would not qualify my praise.  This is one of the best films ever.  Of any kind.My Neighbor Totoro is a small gem--reflecting the wondrous ""everything is new"" experience of childhood--grounded in reality, with elements of magic applied sparingly; a tone neither grim nor overly cute.  Evocative of Japanese rural life and simple everyday pleasures.  The world of the film is suffused with a Shinto-inspired sense of the consciousness of all things, of joyful respect for 'kami'.  Everything is alive:  in both the material and spiritual realms.It is unfortunate Disney chose not to include those extras available on the Japanese DVD.  This, I suspect, was intended to save a few dollars:  to avoid having to provide additional translation and subtitles.(This immense media conglomerate must watch every penny, lest it fall behind the competition?  What competition?  Disney waits impatiently--for the day they are certain will come, inevitably--when they own every character, every story.)The popular preconception is that films for children should not be subtitled.  Are there no children hard of hearing?  Are all children incapable of reading subtitles?  We underestimate both their needs and their abilities.Why the interminable delay between the time Disney licensed the work of Studio Ghibli, and the date the DVDs were released?  Immersed in a corporate culture which insists Disney is synonymous with feature-length animation--or promotes the delusion that Disney is the only player in the field--some executives might have been attempting to prevent Miyazaki's works from being released at all."	4.0	Not as good as it should have been, but still worth the wait	2006-03-11	13	11	2

""My Neighbor Totoro"" demonstrates that respect can be entertaining - something you'd never discover in American movies.I used to recommend ""Totoro"" pretty routinely to just about every customer at the video store I worked at in the early 90s and the movie enchanted each of them - many of whom didn't have kids. But they loved this ""kids"" movie.

As long as you have subtitles the original Japanese is much better and fits in with Gibli's characters better than the English. Of course it is good to have the dubbed version for kids.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1GUK0J0OQHS0W	Michael Love	&quot;My neighbor Totoro&quot; is an animated feature for all ages. The animation in this film is of such a high quality it puts most other animation to shame (including Disney and Pixar). The high level of detail in the animation extends to both the characters and their surroundings. Each frame of the animation is like a piece of artwork. You see shadows on the walls and floors and in the water you see ripples and reflections. The backgrounds are full of everyday items and objects like desk clutter and kitchen items, the sort of items that everyone takes for granted and yet is so often left out of animated features. The artwork and attention to detail all add to the realism of the story.The story line is simple enough for younger children to follow and yet has elements to keep grownups interested. The story follows the lives of a Japanese family over the span of about a month. It's a nice family story with a few fantastical characters like the Soot sprites and the forest spirits. It's a fresh wholesome and upbeat story with no villains or protagonists, family fun at its best. It is a true classic.Buy this movie because no matter what your age you will love it.

The mother is sick, I assume with cancer, and the rest of the family decides to move closer to the hospital.  They move into an old house, very rural in nature, surrounded by wooded hills, rice paddies and nature.The two sisters, voiced by Dakota Fanning and Elle Fanning, really bring warmth and heart to the story.  The spirits who live near the house are friendly and kind to the girls.  But there is also, besides joy and wonder, great sadness in many parts of the film.  I would not suggest the film for young kids who know the pain of a loved one who is suffering from cancer or any other life threatening illness.  It might add to their feeling of helplessness.	5.0	Not for the whole family...	2006-04-23	11	2	9

This version has different voices, some different music and even different spoken lines in some places. We were very disappointed with these changes.  After doing some research, we realized our mistake.  This DVD version is different because it was put out by Disney whereas the original was put out by Fox.  Apparently, there are two versions of this movie and we prefer the Fox version much better.  Even though the Disney version has the celebrity voices of Tim Daly and Dakota Fanning, it lacks the quirky joy of Hayao Miyazaki's original version.

Although we were concerned about it, it doesn't bother them one bit that Satsuki and Mei's mom is in the hospital for the entire movie. Another neat part about the show from a parent's point of view: older sister Satsuki takes care of little Mei and her Daddy during the movie- she makes lunches for the family and holds Mei at the bus stop.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1WX42M589VAMQ	Mir	"I had heard good things--great things--about MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO for years. I still avoided it. (I tend to avoid anime. My husband puts some on: I leave the room.) Plus, it looked as if it were for kiddies.I am an idiot. I could not have been more wrong.To summarize it--well, look around. The reviews are full of that: Father and two daughters  of the Kutsakabe family move to countryside in Japan (circa 1950's) while their mother is recovering in a hospital (from some unspecified ailment, maybe TB?) and the girls discover they are neighbors to magical ""trolls""--totoros--three of them, small and medium and very large! They learn the wonders of their new environs with the Totoros and they get a happy ending regarding their family situation, but in a way that will make you both smile and get moist in the eyes.Nothing complex. It's what the writer/director/artists do with this simple premise that adds up to soooooooooo much more.This film taps into the warmest, most human, most loving, gentlest, dreamiest bits of my young self that still hides inside my middle-aged self. It reminded me of what it was like to~have a dad I adored and who cared selflessly for me~ be young and see enchantments in the world~explore and be carefree physically~have fun with the simplest, new things, like a fresh bit of produce from a a plant in a pot or from someone's garden--which seemed like magic to me when I was young), or from a bath or from climbing a tree~be young and lost and afraid without family nearby~worry a beloved parent might die (as I feared when I was very, very young, like Mei, and my Papi was hospitalized.)I understand some of the critique about the vocals, but, geesh, get past it. It's hardly an issue in light of the amazing animation (just watch the girls, the little things, the details, that so absolutely prove that the artist(s) have observed young kids very, very carefully), the playfulness, the delights of the Totoros (I can't watch Chibi Totoro and not giggle. Physically unable to stop myself from just letting loose with a cascade of heeheehees!).It's a movie which opens with slow, establishing scenes of this new place for the family, but which soon utterly enraptures you with these darling girls and the weird but lovable Totoros and the kind, distracted Papa. The scene with Mei on Big Totoro's furry tummy is pure perfection. Watch her legs, the way she lays there and plays with Totoro's face. The way she scoots. The gorgeous bonding the ensues. The restfulness.And the scene at the bus stop/catbus stop: Wow. Look at the way the shadows and light are done. The hilarity of O Totoro and his leaf hat. The joy of raindrops on an umbrella. The sweetness of sleepy Mei and the unselfishness and kindness of Satsuki.The scene with the night ride: Oh. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Who wouldn't want to be five or six again and ride on a Totoro's tummy through a moonlit night, over rice fields and camphor trees?If you have high BP, this movie will settle it down, it's such a bit of grace pouring on you. If you want something beautiful that fills you with a sense of nostalgia: This is it.Feel young again. Feel magic. Feel joy.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A19SU9WODMO0KP	mixacase	I've been a fan of Miyazaki's work for life time. I just happened to rewatched this movie recently. My impression on it barely changed for the past 20 years.Almost every 5 minute it hits you with some of the most charming background music I've ever heard, for some reason it does really enhance the mood to a bizzare level. There are not much of new materials in this movie, yet I tend to just watch it without thinking much anything else. The atmosphere is so decent there isn't a single moment that while watching it that you would question about what the movie is showing. You just want it keep going and going, and smile while watching.The voice acting is really something, they somehow capture 'it' I never seen american anime with voice acting at this quality. I would believe if someone tell me these voice actors been trained to do this movie for years before actual performing it. It was unbelivably natural, consider this is a totally Japanese based production, sure many would agree there are cultural difference between the 2. I was intended to watch it with subtitle, it is actually after hearing the voice i changed my mind. They are truly amazing.The voice the songs,too. This took me by surprise, I smiled when I heard it, but from the bottom of my heart, they did it good, good enough I would actually think it's the japanese singer singing in English language. Highway sweet, can only call the songs that.The movie is really just what children's material should be, nothing more, it is very obvious it's the direction it's taking put an ennormous effect into it, you can't express how a movie being so 'smooth' when that timeless smooth thing you have to experience in the movie to find out. I've watched all the Miyazaki's work, this title pretty much still stands at the top 4 in my book even to compare to all of them.I think whether you like animation or not you can still have many fun in this quiet 1 1/2 short animation, and you would experience something good you don't find from any others.This is a true treasure.-[...]	5.0	This is a true gift from the 90s	2013-06-27	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1GBIFA2E7XWY6	MiyaTanka	The differences between the Fox and Disney versions may not be important to little kids.  The characters are compelling enough to hold the kids attention.  For older kids and adults, they may be bothered by the inconsenticies of the voice overs.  I thought Fanning's performance was fine in some places, but too flat in others.  In order to get full enjoyment out of the story, watch it in the original Japanese w/ subtitles.  Sometimes the subtitles are not perfect either, but you can get a sense of the emotional range of the characters, even if you don't understand the language.  Even with the flaws this is an entertaining movie for all ages.	4.0	2 different dubbed versions confusing	2006-03-21	4	3	1
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1OB5SKFDZVKUD	M. Kaplan	I couldn't wait for My Neighbor Totoro to be released on DVD. When I finally received the DVD, what a disappointment. Its full screen (pan&amp;scan) and the audio is sub par. Fox rushed this out only to capitalize off of Spirited Away's success. Its basically the Videotape edition transfered to disc. Anyone who appreciates the advantages of viewing DVDs and the artistic genius of Miyazaki will be greatly let down. Disney has done a beautiful job on Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service and Castle in the Sky. I only hope Fox will rerelease a better edition of this masterpiece.	2.0	Animee masterpiece...Terrible DVD, buy the video.	2003-04-24	27	24	3
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A8GRLH1ZGOPDJ	M. Lilliquist	"In case you do not already know, this is one of the great animated family movies of all time, another gem by the Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli (maker of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"").  Any description of the story in mere words comes up short, especially since some of the most important parts of the story do not involve dialog per se.  The story follows two young girls as they move into an old country house with their father while their mother is away in the hospital.  There's no conflict driven plot, no good versus evil struggle, just a tale of discovery and wonder, and genuine emotion.  Unlike most movies -- but like real life -- events seem to unfold naturally at their own pace.  Rather than the audience being told what to think, and how to feel, Miyazaki lets us follow along while the two children discover and then befriend an amazing magical creature (Totoro) living in the enormous tree next door, a symbolic representation of both nature and the power of childhood imagination.  Highly recommended for ages 6 through 60.Originally in Japanese, Totoro has been dubbed into English twice, the second time by media giant Disney using Hollywood talents such as Dakota Fanning and Tim Daly.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, the Disney product is a bit ""flatter."" Disney also messed around with the dialog -- dumbing things down in an attempt to make things more easily understood.  The result is that characters seem less intelligent and less is left to the imagination - which is exactly the opposite of Miyazaki's purpose in making movies all about imagination and a respect for children.  The Disney version is available in DVD, but if you can find the older version on VHS videotape, I'd recommend it.  It is not so much that the older version is perfect (it has its own drawbacks), but that the older version seems truer to the original spirit of Miyazaki."	4.0	Great movie, but look for the non-Disney version	2006-07-13	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1VCG7N8BV7XWC	MLPlayfair	This absolutely lovely video combines a fairy tale and a heartwarming family saga. &quot;Whimsical&quot; is an excellent word for it. This is my first experience with anime, and I needed some time to get used to the wide mouths. But the detail -- in the landscapes, etc. -- is remarkable and visually captivating. The colors are brilliant. The characters are lovely and endearing. The creatures are gentle, fun, and comforting. NOT SCARY AT ALL! Rated G -- there's even a bathtub scene in which the entire Japanese family participates, but there's nothing embarrassing to see. An outstanding animated film.	5.0	A whimsical fairy tale with beautiful animation.	2000-12-08	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3K8DFDJOB412W	M. Mendez	We've been buying this over and over for every friend whose kid is approaching toddler-hood because it's a movie that any little kid would love. It's about a little girl, ~3, and her adventures with her older sister (~10) exploring the wooded area near their new home. The portrayal of the children is magical; I've never seen an animated toddler come so close to evoking the real thing! It's hysterical to watch May (in the movie) with my daughter and laugh together about how similar they are.It's also a wonderful story; there are no bad guys or evil stepmothers or fighting. It's a positive, happy story, and the premise is so creatively inventive that its the stuff of daydreams for parents and kids.These Disney-released versions are great, but if you've new to Miyazaki (the Director) and want to see more (when the kids are older or on your own - they're not all appropriate for littles), look for the Japanese versions and watch with the subtitles. The Fanning sisters did an awesome job here (and it's cool that the mouths match the words), but many of the other stories are darker, and the English dubs never seem to capture the range of expressivity.	5.0	Best movie for threes/fours ...ever.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1XN4GCNV16DF0	M. Neal	This was my second delving into Miyazaki after Spirited Away, and while Spirited Away was the superior film, this was still a very enjoyable movie. This film excels most as a story for small children, one of the best children's movies I have ever seen, in fact. As a parent, one element I love about this movie is that are no typical American clich&eacute;s to be found. There are no villains, fight scenes, and no disbelieving parent or malicious siblings. While the plot may be to simple for adults, it's still charming, and absolutely perfect for children. My only complaint about this DVD has nothing whatsoever to do with the film. FOX has really treated this badly as it's only in pan and scan, there are absolutely no extras, and the sound could use some work. Don't be put off by the cover art either, that's another FOX blunder. The actual film is very visually apealling and doesn't have the garish, cartoony look of the cover art.	4.0	One of the Great Children's Movies	2003-05-08	5	5	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3R6TYGEVJ1DIN	"Mokadi Jook ""Geonni"""	For me the main reason to get this release is to get the original Japanese language.  The dubbing on the Fox release was good, but like most dubbing, not entirely accurate in translation.  Plus, it just feels better having spoken Japanese.  My other reason was that the Fox release cover art was dreadful.  I almost didn't buy it.  I would have missed out on my all-time favorite animated film.  Back when I worked at a video store I would recommend this film to parents with young kids, and fans of Anime.  It was usually rented somewhat grudgingly, but nearly all the folks I recommended it to ended up buying it.  And the book.  And some stuffed Totoros, and all kinds of other Totoro things.

I didn't notice that they had re-done the voiceover, and I am disappointed at the result. The dvd itself is good, animation like I remember it, and has a few notable extras. But they changed a memorable point for me, instead of ""dust bunnies"" they call those cute little black dust balls ""goblins"" which seems like a very poor attempt to insert some American culture in a clearly Japanese film. I say ""VERY poor"" since the image of little ugly green goblins is a staggering contrast to the adorable dust bunnies.Overall, a movie that I thoroughly enjoyed as a child feels stripped of it's original charm in this ""Special Edition"".

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1QVFHPY8418HC	monkuboy	Hayao Miyazaki's movies all have a magical feel to them and My Neighbor Totoro is no exception. This animated feature follows ten year old Satsuki and her four year old sister Mei on their adventure in the Japanese countryside and encounter with the Lord of the Forest, the giant but very cute Totoro.You can read the other reviews to find out more about the plot; in this review I want to focus on what I really liked about this movie (I also liked the plot as well, but no use retelling it here).The animation, like all of Miyazaki's movies, is first rate. I must point out that I've seen both the original version of the DVD released in America, done by Fox Video, and the Disney version. Do yourself a favor and buy the Disney version - it is way better than the sorry Fox version. I would highly recommend watching it in the original Japanese language with subtitles (assuming you don't understand Japanese).  The movie flows so much better that way and you get nuances that are bludgeoned by the English dubbing job.  Even the music and the background sound effects are different, with the English version being way too heavy handed.The Disney version also has the movie in the original widescreen aspect ratio whereas the Fox version has the pan and scan altered ratio.As for the movie itself, Satsuki and Mei act very natural (as natural as cartoon characters can be, that is). They don't act precocious, they don't act bratty, they aren't made to be overly cute or lovable, they are simply made to be real and believable. All in all, this is a charming story with excellent production values, and I am thankful that someone released it in its original aspect ratio with the original language and soundtrack. Only this version does this great movie justice.By the way, a bit of trivia - Ken Jennings, the Jeopardy wonder-guy, has a Totoro on his keychain for good luck.	5.0	A Magical Movie	2008-10-18	3	3	0

She believes thoroughly that Totoros truly exist. Totoros are magical kami/sprite beings that perhaps only children (and adults who believe) can see. My daughter has &quot;seen&quot; Totoros (especially the big gray one, the &quot;Totoro&quot;) and they live for her moreso than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny. We have searched high and low in Japanese grocery stores and comic book stores that sell &quot;anime&quot; (japanese animation)in the United States for Totoro dolls and &quot;Cat bus&quot; toys. As for her parents, no movie since Star Wars has transformed us in our hearts and minds, and we have enticed adults who would never even look at animation as an adult oeuvre to &quot;experience&quot; Totoro. The producer of the this movie, Miyazaki Hayao, has provided us a world where magic exists, children can be believed, and, whenever, you need help, Totoro, is there beside you.

In some of the scenes she, to me, sounds more like a boy than a girl.Mei (played by Elle Fanning) sounds much too old some times then sounds like someone talking in a bad baby voice.Even the songs in the Disney release they over do the bad pronunciation of Totoro and make it ToeToeRRRow.  I really do not understand why they would want to Americanize the pronunciation of the name in the first place.  It sounds like what a really young child would do should they sound out the word if they were just learning to read.The picture quality is better than the Fox release however the voice acting is just bad.	2.0	Disney used diffrent voice actors than Fox.	2013-03-16	6	2	4

Mai's voice especially, done by an adult instead of a child actor, is grating. The dialogue gets a little stilted and formal, but this is 1950's Japan, so it actually works fine.I always find it fascinating to watch the English dub while the literal translation track runs on subtitles... you can see what hoops the translators went through (or simply avoided) to get around Japanese cultural references. Watch the scenes involving the dad and kid going to visit the camphor tree and you'll see what I mean: no Japanese kid needs to have it explained what a tree spirit is...I recommend an excellent direct translation of the Japanese dialogue at www2.gol.com/users/billp/totoro/ as a way of getting a direct feel for the way the film was written... and maybe the US distributors should think about ""kids dubs"" and ""adult dubs"" as alternatives..."	4.0	Good but shoulda been great: dub vs translation	2005-12-26	4	2	2

As the old saying goes: if you have a child, are a child, or ever were a child, you need to see this.I can, unfortunatly, say a few less than positive things about the DVD that Fox/FHE has put together here, and I have to dock a star here, and considered docking more.  It's excusable that this is a no-extras release: it's bargain-priced, and I'm sure that the age of the film and the language barrier would make assembling a supplements package difficult.  It is NOT excusable that the film is presented ONLY in pan-and-scan format, with ONLY the (admittedly good) English-language soundtrack.  This film is a work of art, and the only (legal) way to see it right now in the US is in a form that's been vandalized, and that's a pity.That said...buy it anyway.  Your kids won't notice the difference, and hopefully if this disc sells well someone at Fox will notice and put together a proper edition for the enthusiasts.	4.0	Brilliant movie, sub-par DVD.	2003-03-26	15	14	1

I don't like subtitles, I don't want to be reading the bottom of the screen whilst watching a movie and my 3 year old certainly benefits from English spoken rather than Japanese.This movie is incredibly charming and so different from Pixar/Disney movies. This is true magic, a world made from Children's imaginations. I can't speak for the changes made to the movie during translation as I haven't seen the original but as it stands this movie is one of my most favourite movies for my Daughter. The scene on the dvd with the Umberella is beautiful, I don't know how Miyazaki can come up with these things in his head I hope we see these Disney releases in more places and gain popularity, people need to see this style of movie!.	4.0	Charming	2013-09-10	2	1	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1MTWKERWTEZEO	nglbrkr	This is such a good film that my 4 year old daughter has seen it about a hundred times, and so have I! The quality of animation is outstanding - you see new details each time you watch. The story is absolutely wonderful - no violence, no aggression, but plenty of plot to keep your attention. Its the story of two little girls who go to live in a new (haunted)house in the country with their Dad (Mum is in hospital). The girls soon meet the spirit king of the forest (Totoro) and fantastic adventures follow. This film is a window into rural Japanese culture, disguised as a children's cartoon.	5.0	This is the best children's video ever	2001-06-01	0	0	0

One of those 2 DISC special editions that has both a DVD and a BLU-RAY disk in it, right?  WRONG!!!  What a cheap trick!  And Amazon contributes to this, do a search for 'Miyazaki Blu-ray' and guess what shows up?  GRR.If my kid wasn't such a huge Totoro fan I would have sent this one back.  I thought I was replacing our old dvd with this... after a little research I did anyway.  Turns out there are 2 English dubs of 'My Neighbor Totoro' and the pre-Disney one is worth bank!  Plus it was fun watching both versions.  Each has different voice actors, and just a few significant differences in translation and/or 'Disney-fications' of some of the turns of phrase.  ""Soot spirits"" became ""Soot sprites"", nothing major, just slightly more cutesy here and there.All that aside, this is a sweet story.  Great for the whole family, even wee ones who get scared at anything.  Miyazaki is a genius and even tho' I enjoy others of his like Princess Mononoke and Nausica, it's nice to watch one that's not trying to pummel me over the head about the dangers of war or the perils of industrialization."	3.0	Misleading 'Blu' box top...	2011-08-26	8	3	5

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A20MT8K2SEDNR8	Panek	This was one of my most favorite movies growing up... I purchased this Disney release based on several reviews because they stated that this bluray/DVD has the FOX version on it as well... It does not have the FOX version on it at all.  I cannot stand the cast they chose to voice these characters... The cast they had in the FOX version brought the heart and soul to the movie for those of us that grew up with this movie.  Dakota Fanning and her sister? That alone should have been a clue that Disney was not that invested in this movie.  They should at least keep the original American version on the DVD/bluray... I had to turn off the movie 15 minutes into it because it was just not as good.  I might even have to return the movie and find a FOX version DVD, I would rather have an old DVD that is an amazing movie... Over a rerelease on bluray that just sucks.  I gave this DVD/bluray a 3/5 because it is still a great story and movie but what Disney did to it was a bad move...  Looks like I will have to watch it in Japanese because there is no way I can watch the whole movie listening to Dakota Fanning and her sister doing a horrible job.	3.0	Fox version is better	2014-04-30	1	0	1

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1ZGK095OUOOT1	Paul Ahn	Totoro, in classic Miyazaki tradition, brings the fantastic into the realm of everyday occurrences. The underlying story is rather pedestrian: a Japanese father moves into the countryside with his two daughters, and they adjust to their new pastoral environment while waiting for the mother to be released from the hospital. We are not explained exactly why the mother is bedridden, but the ambiguity plays an effective role in keeping the dramatic tension taut throughout the film. However, the plot is driven mainly by the imagination of the two children whose experiences with the magical create the driving mechanism behind the film.Without giving anything away, MY NEIGHBOR, TOTORO is a heartwarming film that inspires both the young and the old alike. Watching the film again several years after seeing it in the theaters, I realize that the story works NOT because it is about fantastic and magical characters but rather it involves everyday struggles. In TOTORO, we see Miyaki revisiting the same themes (i.e. familial harmony, nature, environmental awareness, courage, etc.) that he further develops in his later works. Nevertheless, the mastery and the imagination behind his craft keeps the story fresh.Despite what the Box Office report card may indicate for MY NEIGHBOR, TOTORO, this is a film sure to be a hit with the family.	4.0	A Hit for All Generations	2006-08-05	5	5	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A42GFMF12V7XR	Paul J. Mular	"Forget the old FOX VIDEO DVD release (cropped & dubbed) look for this new Disney DVD release in 1.85:1 (16:9 enhanced widescreen.Original Japanese audio & new English dub, storyboards, behind-the-scenes.This is the original edit as dictated by Ghibli Studios, not a re-edit. It has the original Japanese language tracks. Some mistake the 1980's english version as the original, it is not.The old version is actually the RE-EDIT created by 20th Century Fox for U.S. theatrical release. At the time Studio Ghibli was eager to get their films shown in the U.S. and did not retain creative control. They really regretted this and wish to believe these U.S. edits never existed (the U.S. edit of Nausicaa was the worst).Now that their films are popular in the U.S. they are exercising their creative control and forbid Disney from altering the films. Disney was in charge of re-dubbing the English translations with Studio Ghibli's approval of the translation. The pronunciation of the names is closer to the original Japanese pronunciation.It is doubtful that you will ever hear the old 20th Century FOX translation again on DVD/Blu-ray. 20th Century FOX no longer holds the U.S. rights to Totoro.The cover doesn't mention any edits because it is NOT edited, the old 20th Century FOX version is the edited version that should have been labeled as such.BLU-RAY update 5/30/13:If you are going to upgrade to the new Blu-ray consider how big your TV is.  If your HD-TV is not over 40"" you will not see much of an upgrade.  Studio Ghibli dictated that Disney not tamper with the film to 'enhance' it for Blu-ray.  You will get the original image on the Blu-ray, but Disney's 2006 DVD was so good there will not be much of an improvement."	5.0	Blu-ray not much of an upgrade from the DVD.

Ok, let's continue.The background to my login page on all of my computers is a watercolor of the bus stop screen depicted on the cover of the Blu-Ray, that is how much I am a fan of this movie. The story is priceless. A young girl and her toddler sister deal with moving into a new house out in the country with their father while their mother is in the hospital suffering from an unknown illness, but the country will do her good. The toddler encounters a totoro and befriends it, even the young girl eventually meets the totoro.This Blu_ray package does not disappoint. The HD transfer is wonderful. There is a DVD copy (handy for soccer Moms and Dads who need to keep the rugrats occupied for long trips in the family van), multiple commentaries, subtitles and languages. There is even even the English subtitle of the Japanese audio, as well as the English subtitle of the English audio.Unfortunately I can award this only 5 stars, it really deserves more.	5.0	Best.

This is because the film contains many subtle points that  will be readily grasped by the adult viewer. The story centres on the  friendship that develops between two children and a forest spirit. While  their mother is critically ill the children are made to feel happy due to  their exploits. If you have seen any other examples of Miyazaki's work such  as Laputa, Warriors of the wind, Grave of the fireflies, then you will  understand the attraction in these animes. Fans of violent Mangas should  look elsewhere, however if you enjoy a good story with competent dubbing,  suitable music and memorable characters then Totoro is the answer.	5.0	One of the most highly rated Animes	2000-03-15	4	4	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A30II9RK39OXCR	Pilar Rowe	Let me start by saying my family loves this movie and our original VHS is very worn out. I was hoping to replace the tape with the Disney DVD release.  I was so disappointed.  They changed Satsuki's name - and pronounce it Satski - yuck!!  They added unnecessary dialogue - one of the things I love about the original is that it doesn't try to explain everything, it makes you think.  If you are trying to replace your old VHS - this is not the one to buy.  It's probably fine, for anyone who hasn't seen the original...My Neighbor Totoro	2.0	Don't replace your old VHS with this Disney version...	2007-12-28	7	4	3
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A13DQTXG02HZC1	Ping Lim	Its enchanting to jog down the memory lane yet again.  I was captivated by Totoro and its friends when I was a child.  As we grew up, becoming adults & preoccupied with our works to sustain our livelihood, we forget about the magical time being a child & the innocence that comes with it.  In darkness, there lurks the ghosts & monsters & when we hear the wind blow, we would think of imaginary friends keeping us company with their haunting tunes & even of fantastical trips that those friends would take us along.  Typical of Miyazaki's high standard, the characters, the settings are given doses of life which are realistic and not cheesy in any way.  In fact, Miyazaki's offerings are always appealing to people of all ages and the stories are something that we can relate to as they talk of family, memory, friendship, coexistence with nature and other transient beings.  It's all about live and let live, humanity at its utmost best.  This movie allows us to see the postwar Japanese society when adults have to work hard in the city whilst their children are left in the countryside where standard of living is much lower.  Community spirit is strong where elderly would look after their children.  Ultimately, there's Totoro in all of us.  Perhaps, it's difficult for some adults to admit to that!  The other highlight of this DVD offering is the documentary describing of the beginning of Studio Ghibli, how that name comes about, quirky traits of Hayao Miyazaki, his strong relationship with the producer, Suzuki, Hayao's beginning et cetera.  Highly recommended.	4.0	Truly Enchanting Moment	2007-07-15	3	1	2

Miyazaki is a master at capturing children's personalities.  Some people complained that this movie doesn't have a real &#34;conflict&#34; stage, but that's the art of Miyazaki films - he breaks the traditional film structure and takes you on a unique journey.  The whimsical feel of this movie and the plot line made me feel curious and excited, just like a child (before they realize how crappy the real world actually is, hahhaha).	5.0	Great movie!	2013-12-09	0	0	0

All three of us were nothing less then devastated by Disney's new sound track - for all intents and purposes it is not the same film at all.  The opening song is different and worse.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	APS5FKXJW3VXS	Poseur	@_@ *To-To-Ro* *To-To-Ro*I have been hypnotized. The opening and closing songs are so addictive.My Neighbour Totoro is my favourite Miyazaki movie. It is too short. The plot is too simple. Ok. That's it. Now onto the good stuff.THE GOOD STUFF (in less than 1000 words ...... much less)There is one factor in this movie which makes it all right. And that is its magical quality. I am amazed when I think about how such a simple and short story can become one of my favourite movies in the world. Not only me, but for many others as well, both children and adults. Thus, it can only be magic.Two sisters moved to the countryside with their father. Their mother is laying in a nearby hospital thanks to an unexplained illness. The sisters explored the countryside and stumbled upon these magical creatures dubbed as Totoros. As their concerns grew more and more for their ill mother, the Totoros helped the girls to deal with their fears by interacting with them. They do boring stuff together like flying across the countryside and growing gigantic trees in their backyard and riding a terrain-unaffected Cat-Bus. As I said, boring stuff. O_O..........This is a movie too good to pass up, especially if you have kids. Leave Barney alone for a minute and get this NOW.	5.0	To To Ro, To To Ro	2001-11-26	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A37K1ED5P8DYGA	Preston McClear, Author  The Boy Under the Bed	Two sisters, 10-year-old Satsuki and 4-year-old Mei, go to live in the country side with their father while their mother recovers in the hospital from an illness. One day, while in the forest, Satsuki and Mei discover a magical spirit named the Totoro who becomes the gentle protector of the two children. The Totoro is a surrogate parent for the children during a time of family crisis. There is a depth of emotion between the two sisters which is unheard of in American animated films. As always director Hayao Miyazaki leads us on a rich emotional journey in which character takes precedent over narrative. There are no cheap jokes or cloying attempts at gaining the audience's sympathy. Miyazaki is confident enough in his own craft to let his stories tell themselves. My Neighbor Totoro is another great work from a modern master.Preston McClear, author The Boy Under the Bed	5.0	A Treat For Both Parents And Children	2003-03-04	0	0	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AXUUE5ACWNKRV	"""pss-enterprises"""	it is still worth having. As someone else mentionned, better this DVD than none. This is my three year old son's favorite movie. We wore out the first VHS copy we had, so we were thrilled to get a DVD. What I love about it is that the girls find the spirit world, and even though their father can't see it, he believes them, unlike typical Disney fare where the parents never believe the children until the end. I have seen this movie several times, but I never get tired of it. There is always so much to see in a Miyazaki film.	4.0	This DVD edition may not do it justice, but	2003-01-20	0	0	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AGPD9DMD8TYE4	quynh tran (qatran@emial.msn.com)	As parents, we've been buying lot of Disney animated movies for our kids (9 and 2 year old). Then one day we saw this cute litle creature on the  cover of this Japanese video cover, I decided to buy it and what an  investment that was. From that momemnt on we fell in love with every single  charecter of the movie, yes, there is no need for a villain in this movie,  no bad guys, and the movie still great, Disney should take note of this.  Totoro came into our family life such as a fresh breeze and gave us a total  new look on kid's movie, more magical than any Disneyesque stuffs we saw in  the past. The story was so original, the rural Japan backgound and the  school scene reminded me Viet Nam of my youth ( yes , Viet Nam, when there  was no fighting nearby). I wept when the kids cried and laughed throghuout  the movie, specially my 2 year old. She must watch it every night before  she can sleep.	5.0	not enough stars for this movie	1999-10-25	45	42	3
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1PO0PHM9UN82E	Rabbit	This is a review for the Disney dubbed version of My Neighbor Totoro (Two-Disc Special Edition),  with Dakota and Elle Fanning providing the voices for Satsuki and Mei.It was great, the whole family loved it adults and kids alike. Nobody dies in this movie so you won't have kids bawling over a dead deer like in Bambi or such.  The Special Features and Editorial Reviews sections from Amazon tell you probably all you need to know about the story and what you'll find on the bonus disc,  but I will add that you can watch/listen to the movie with the original Japanese sound track/voices, which may be important to some people. I enjoyed the English dub and then I watched it again with the original Japanese soundtrack, with English subtitles.  There is also a French dub option.I don't have the other versions, so I can't compare them- but I can say that this is a great version and all the actors did a great job with the voice acting.  Totally worth the $19.99.	5.0	Disney Dubbed Version is Great	2011-01-25	4	4	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A10FK0DJQLSHH7	Ralph Broom	"As one of my favorite films of all time, I was crushed to have to give this release four stars.  I had high hopes for a Disney release, and the one bonus is the anamorphic (widescreen) presentation.  The trouble is with the re-recorded dialogue.  A cast of stars (Dakota Fanning, etc.) lend their voices, but the charm and spark is lessened.  In particular Mei's voice and vocabulary (the youngest girl) is no longer that of a toddler.  For example, earlier releases translated her discovery of tadpoles in a stream as a verbal struggle, saying ""golly-pollywogs!"".  In this release she just says ""Tadpoles!"".  Endearing touches like that make the Troma translation clearly a work of love.  Disney's translation is perhaps more literally correct, but colder and more corporate for it.Update: Now that my 2.5 year old daughter has seen it several times (and become addicted) I feel I should temper my review.  If SHE finds the spark in it, perhaps it simply is different from my expectations.  I still believe a younger voice for Mai would be ideal, but now I'm just being picky."	4.0	New dialogue damages charm	2010-03-06	7	6	1
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A90HR3HTX862Y	Ralph Saunders	For all of its well-documented shortcomings, this version of the movie is far SUPERIOR to the more recent re-release for one compelling reason: the English dub version actors are flat out better than the big names hired by Disney to re-do it. They have an innocence and charm that the newer release tries (and fails) to mimic. I waited a long time for a widescreen release and was sorely disappointed when I discovered the new audio track. My advice is to accept the shortcomings of this otherwise simply delightful and still superior dvd.	5.0	Superior to Disney Re-Release in Spite of Shortcomings	2008-07-19	1	1	0

Not only is the animation beautiful, the background artwork breath-taking, but the story line and the characters all conspire to take the audience on a trip to the heart of Japan where different values and life rhythm take over. On the one hand, you are brought back to a child-like innocence and faith, on the other you realize there is nothing childish about innocence. There is no Disney-esque feel good platitude here; you are made to see life through children's eyes and then suddenly realize it's the only way to view life.	5.0	One of Miyazaki's classics	2013-07-30	4	3	1

They meet and befriend the creature and other related creatures, and have adventures with them. Great animation and music add to the story, as well as a rescue mission that has a happy ending.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2JB1M0QWBQ4FL	Roast Pork	This is the definitive English-dubbed version.  You've got to have it.Steer clear of the Disney product.  They butchered Totoro.I concur that a full-blown multi-disc DVD would be nice, but then you might be settling for Disney dubbing.  And all the good Fox version DVD's will be bought up and no longer available.  Or they will be $200 collector's items.I truly hate what Disney does to Japanese film.  All the film's messages are reduced to a slow 1st grade reading level.  Americanisms are substituted for Japanisms.  Famous AMerican actors are used for the voices.  Very distracting.Get a clue, Disney.  I'm trying to watch a Japanese film so I can see a Japanese film.  I don't need it dumbed down and Americanized.Note that the above criticism is directed agaist the Disney product.This Fox product is great.  Whatever anime you can get your hands on that Disney hasn't touched, congratulations.I hate what Disney does to anime ever more than I hate Ted Turner for colorizing everything, but it's the same kind of hate.	5.0	This is the one you want	2007-07-30	6	4	2

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1YSI93GVIVPPT	Robert Fernandez	I remember seeing this back in '95, and after picking up the video just recently, this small wave of nostalgia ran over me.My Neighbor Totoro, directed by one of THE greatest animators of all time, has touched the hearts of millions. Hayao Miyazaki did a superb job when he adapted this movie from the children's book of the same name. Though the book only had one girl, Hayao decided to metaphorically 'split her in two' and created an older sister, Setsuki, and a younger sister, Mei, for the anime.And it worked pretty well. Totoro is quite the strange looking creature; he's large, has a big goofy grin on his face(which can only be matched by Gengar's) throughout most of the movie, he can fly, AND he's friends with a freakish looking bus called the Cat Bus. While it all sounds very childish, anyone who ever was a child can enjoy this movie. My Neighbor Totoro NEVER makes the adults look like the 'bad parents' that we see far too often in most american children's films. In fact, the father even tells his two daughters that he believes that what they say about Totoro is true. Even the slightly-scary looking Nanny turned out to be the one of the friendliest persons in the movie. Plus, the animation is AWESOME, especially for a film that came out in the late 80's. Even today Totoro's animation rivals the best animes'.Highly recommended for those with an open mind.	5.0	One of the first, and best, anime I've ever seen!	2003-05-04	7	7	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	I have been a huge Miyazaki fan for nearly twenty years now, but I am ashamed to admit that I have only now seen MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO for the first time.  The reason is a good one, as reasons go:  it was the last important film by Miyazaki that I had not yet seen, and I was saving it for a special occasion.  I love seeing again films that I have loved the first time through, but there is always a special magic to seeing a film for the first time.  Unfortunately, I now no longer have any Miyazaki films to see that I haven't already seen (at least until he finishes his work-in-progress, which has been given the tentative English title HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE).  Fortunately, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO was worth the weight.How does this film compare with Miyazaki's finest films?  This is a hard question, because he has a large number clustered at the top, all of them excellent.  I would be hard pressed to say this was better or worse than any of a number of others.  However, each film is distinguished from the others by the mood and tone of the film.  MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO may be the gentlest and most peaceful of all his films.  True, the girls have moved to the countryside with their father because their mother is in a nearby hospital recovering from a rather vague illness, and the forest is haunted, but the illness is never perceived as especially worrisome (except near the end, when a slight cold prevents her making a brief visit home, provoking a crisis with her daughters), and the spirits in the forest are remarkably benign and benevolent.  There is nothing like the ecological apocalypse in THE PRINCESS MONONOKE and NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, or the parents who have been transformed into swine or threatening spirits of SPIRITED AWAY, or the armed conflict in CASTLE IN THE SKY.  The world in this film is a loving world, all the way down to a remarkable creature that is a cross between Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat and a school bus (literally).Miyazaki's animation is truly in a league of its own, and I mean that as strongly as possible.  It has been decades since the Disney studios were capable of a fraction of the more challenging sequences that Miyazaki seemingly animates with ease.  For instance, the wind and storm the first night the children spend in their new home display effects that Disney hasn't attempted since the more marvelous scenes in BAMBI.  The way the wind is portrayed as moving through the tops of the trees, the hint of spraying mist, the manner in which the wind moves like a wave over the grass, the shuttering of the house under the assault of the air, are all things of remarkable artistry.  Even more remarkable is that after this brief display of mastery, Miyazaki doesn't feel the need to build a huge storm with rain and lightening, but has the wind subside and give way to brilliant white clouds sailing across a moonlit and starry black sky.Of all Miyazaki's extraordinary gifts as an animator and a storyteller, his greatest virtue might be his patience, and this is something he holds in common with many of the Japanese animators.  American animated films are almost always frenetic affairs, in a great rush to fill the screen with activity, and in a hurry to get to the next part of the story.  American animated films seem to be more interested in where they are going than in how they are getting there, while for Miyazaki the journey is the far more important part of the film.  Certainly one reason for this is the distrust of the American film industry of the patience of the viewers, as if they are in abject terror of small children squirming in their seats if the story doesn't get a move on.  Miyazaki, on the other hand, respects his viewers, and is confident that they won't give up on a film simply because the story moves at a steady pace.  In MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, one of the sisters will begin to enter a room, look from one side to the other, take a step, look around again, and gradually and slowly discover what is inside.  In many American films, a child would simply explode into the room and that would be it.  As a result, every moment of the film becomes a discovery of marvelous and wonderful things.I would say that this is a very special film by a very special filmmaker, except for the fact that for Hayao Miyazaki special seems to be the norm.	5.0	Another masterpiece by the world's greatest animator	2003-12-26	121	117	4

Sticky sweet.  Before it was a lovely, innocent, charming movie.  Now it has been made... what?  I was horrified, and very disappointed.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2EQFZTTRBA48K	Robz	"My Neighbor Totoro is a cute little movie. But I think it's cute in the way that a child likes the cartoon series ""Caillou,"" or ""Blues Clues,"" - it has cute characters, but no real plot or hurdles the characters have to overcome. The biggest event in the film is when the youngest sister, Mei, gets lost on the way to visit the sick mother in the hospital. Older sister, Satsuke, must find Mei, so she asks Totoro for help, and he summons a bus for her to hop on and find her.  Which she does.  The end. Nothing happens on the way there on the bus ride, nothing happens at the hospital, nothing happens afterwards.  That's it. Like I said, the characters are cute and the animation is good, but I think this is definitely a YOUNG child film.The thing I found so fascinating about other Miyazaki films is that you're never bored - they're full of fantasy surprises around every corner.  Compared to his other films, this one is slow and un-eventful, and at times, boring.If you're a teenager or adult, and a fan of Miyazaki and loved Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Howl's Castle, then you will probably be dissappointed in this film. There just wasn't enough there to fascinate me or keep me interested.However, if you're looking for a movie to pop in during a family reunion to keep the young children occupied while you're off socializing, then this one would be a good choice.I give it 3 stars - I would give it 2 stars, but the movie is definitely well animated, so I gave it 3."	3.0	Cute, but probably mostly to the average 4 year old...	2006-08-24	15	1	14

That being said, the Disney version, believe it or not, butchers the original English translation. The new voice actors say different things, have a tone of voice that just does not match in certain situations, the catbus has a pitiful ""meow"" instead of the ""MEOOOOW!!"" that it had in the original English version, and Totoro also has a weaker roar in the Disney version than he did in the original English version. I love Disney, I love Totoro but somehow the combination of the two turned out horrific to say the least.

The characters, especially Totoro himself, are beautifully drawn and charming. The story is endearing and joyful. This is my second favorite animated film. (All dogs go to Heaven is my first). If only more children would watch these kind of films instead of raunchy trash like Scooby-Doo One, The Cat in the Hat, and Rugrats Go Wild. Unlike Totoro, these kind of movies completely resort to potty humor and have no gentle tone or magic. While films like those be long forgotten, Totoro will go on into the hearts and minds of all film-lovers forever.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A312PJYZAT564V	Ronska	Ok, I'm a Miyazaki fan, we all know this movie is a masterpiece so there's no reason to bring that up. The movie easily gets 5 stars. The main concern here is the DVD. 20th Century Fox had very little to work with when they did this DVD. For those who don't already know, Disney has owned all of Studio Ghibli's movies since 1996. This includes My Neighbor Totoro in widescreen, Japanese, and anything they could hope to call an extra. That's why Disney is redubbing the movie and that's why this DVD has almost nothing on it and why they couldn't even remaster it. They worked with what they had and did the best they could. Of course, when Disney releases their version, it will have many more features(thought I don't think they will ever top this flawless dub unless they work their magic like they did with Spirited Away.)	2.0	The Reason for the Poor Packaging	2003-12-23	7	7	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3CLU7UOTGFLAW	Roxanne M	"What I did NOT know before getting this was that there are two different English dubbed versions: one by Fox, and one by Disney released in 2006. (Why people are posting reviews for the Fox version here baffles me--this listing is for the DISNEY version, right??)Long story short, the Disney version stinks. It's pretty well-known among the anime community that dubs usually do stink, and over 15 years after first watching Totoro I always thought Fox had done an exceptional job avoiding this stereotype...but Disney ruined it. Let me count the ways!- This might be trivial to most consumers, but the woman who sings the opening and closing themes cannot hold a note. Also, for some reason the ending theme has a pop-country flair to it. These songs are nostalgic and meaningful to me, and it was hard to hear them re-recorded this way. The woman who sang in the Fox version had a very pleasant voice and there were no pop-music additions.- Part of what brings the characters to life are the non-verbal vocal noises they make, like ""hmm""s and grunts and the like. The Disney actors left out so much of those, and left awkward silence between lines instead. This was especially noticeable with Totoro's character, who doesn't have any speaking lines. How can you take away those little grunts he makes when he smiles and opens his eyes wide and really expect him to be the same? The Cat-bus received similar treatment.- Going off the last point, the acting, particularly for Satsuki and Mei, was sub-par, ESPECIALLY when pitted against their previous English voices, which were so lively and well-executed. I really didn't think the snooty tone of voice that Satsuki addressed Mei with when she found her sleeping in the forest fit her character well.- The casting! UGH! I'll give Disney a few brownie points for casting the Dad, Mom, and Granny with actors whose voices were very similar to the previous actors', but Satsuki and Mei sounded like they were barely a year apart. Mei's previous voice was babyish and cute, and gave the impression that she was much younger than her older sister. Except for a few energetic moments from Satsuki, I felt the delivery of both her and Mei's lines was poor and emotionless in the newer Disney version.- **SPOILER ALERT**The script was different--in some places significantly different, although not enough to alter the main plot. Some of the changes would have been better left out; others helped the story make a little more sense. I have mixed feelings about these changes; however, I had a huge problem with the scene that comes after Satsuki and Mei find out that their hospitalized mother has a cold and won't be able to return home yet. In the old version, Satsuki appears very worried and distressed over her mother, and finally bursts into tears when she wonders aloud, ""What are we going to do if Mommy dies? What are we going to do, Nanny??"" As both a child and an adult, I always found this scene to be very moving.**SPOILER ALERT CONT.**In the Disney version, she's pitching an uncharming fit about how the hospital is So Unfair for not letting Mom come back home, and inserts an unnecessary hyperbole of ""She's probably DEAD already!"" multiple times. I felt that this was very inappropriate behavior for a cartoon character to display to children, especially considering the gravity of the situation! Then all of a sudden, Satsuki bursts into tears! Not only was it inappropriate, but poorly executed as far as the acting goes. Forget the fact that I felt absolutely no sympathy toward her for being a whiny brat.With all that said and done, here is my recommendation:If you are an anime fan, buy this version ONLY for the Japanese audio and the extras. That may be all you care about, and if so that's great, but if you're like me and want to share your childhood memories with your children, make sure to get the DVD of the 1994 version as well.If you are a parent of young children, either version (Fox or Disney) is probably ok, but I recommend the Fox (1994) version if only because of the last scene I described.  In and of itself, My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful movie with no scary antagonists to defeat and a strong sense of familial bonds. I think it's a great addition to any child's movie collection."	3.0	Disney broke my childhood	2010-12-14	10	7	3

I own the Fox version, I wish it were widescreen like this version which is a plus. Miyazaki has made some of the best animated films I know of, Spirited Away is my favorite of his works thus far. If this had much better voice acting I would be more than thrilled to get this edition, however simply to have it for the wide screen and japanese original doesn't seem too worth it. I know that some of you will disagree with me, but the voices of the Fox version of this were much better, Mei sounded young, and Sasuke sounded a proper age, the characters here seem to lack emotion and even the catbus was strange to me in the yowling. The voice of the mother and father were fine, but Granny, Mei, Sasuke and the boy don't seem to properly fit the characters. I give this a three because of the advantages of a great story and the extras you get with this, however the voice acting takes this down.	3.0	Amazing Miyazaki Film: Taken Down by Voice Actors	2006-04-13	6	4	2

I have a 4year old who loves this film, having seen the fox version many, many times; however, after only several minutes into this version of the film she objected to the new voices. In her opinion the 2 girls now sound like boys. I think ""boys"" is a strech, but they defineately sound bratty, too old and not like innocent little kids who can see Totoro. From both an adult opinion and that of a child---Try to find the Fox version. All the voices are better and much less ""americanized"" in the fox version. I'm tired having to have famous names tied to animated films. I really don't think kids are going request a film purely because of Dakota's voice and most adults probably aren't either. The fanning sister's voices are no match for the wonderful Japanese animation. I wonder what the executives in TOKYO Disney really think!!"	3.0	An awful version of a wonderful film	2006-03-24	5	2	3

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A4SVSFIPZNE59	Scott Livingston	This is one of the most heartwarming films of director Hayao Miyazaki's collection.  I have seen practically all of Miyazaki's movies, and I love every one of them. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone.  However, if you want to experience this movie as it was intended to be seen, please wait for a better DVD release.  This DVD, by Fox, is missing the Japanese language track (in order to watch it subtitled), and it is full-screen only, meaning the image has been cropped.  Disney is set to re-release this movie, perhaps in 2005, so do yourself a favor and wait until then.  In the meantime, there's nothing wrong with renting this version of Totoro!	2.0	Great movie; but don't buy it (yet)!	2004-02-26	32	28	4

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2U286F55AAA5	S. Greene	"The English language soundtrack for this movie is dull and uninspired.  Even though I don't understand much Japanese, the movie is much more fun in the original with subtitles, because of the energy of the voices.  It begins with the title: in Japanese it's ""Tonari no Totoro,"" which is alliterative and poetic, where the English ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is literally faithful but utterly boring.This seems to have been released in the US mainly for anime lovers and fans of the original.  If the US distributor (Disney it appears) were to commission a ""remake"" of the dub, with a better translation, music, and voice talent, they could have a real ""Finding Nemo"" like hit on their hands."	3.0	Great movie, terrible dub	2008-12-27	4	1	3
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A6MUHRWBP4XMN	ShadowXain	When the dvd arrived, I opened it to find that the studs that hold the discs had broken off, and both discs had been rolling around inside the case for who knows how long. This may or may not have been known to the vendor when the video was sold, bundled and sent - it's hard to say. It did make for a grim realization when I noticed the over-excessive scratch marks on the back of both dvds. Having said that, it is worth noting that both discs worked flawlessly in my computer's dvd player, despite the unattractiveness of the backsides.As for the movie itself, it is a very cute, older Hayao Miyazaki piece that is worth adding to any Miyazaki fan's collection.

They changed the dialog for Mei and Satsuki and some of it just doesn't really fit in well with the movie; also they changed the way Satsuki's name is pronounced. If you listen carefully they changed the way the cat bus meows. If I would have known that this wasn't going to be the same movie as the old VHS one I wouldn't have bought it. It's still good, but not as good as the 20th Century Fox version. Most of the dialog for the father and granny is the same and also most of the background sounds but you can tell they added some more music that to me just doesn't really fit with the original music. But now I know to make sure that when I buy movies I need to make sure they are what I really want. (i just noticed that on the cover on the Disney version they have mixed Satsuki and Mei together!

She now has a 2 year old that just loves the movie too. She got her old VHS out and let her watch before she was old enough to really know ""scared"".Anyway, it was 16 years ago when I first got it for my daughter and she has guarded that movie more than jewelry and other special things.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	ABMN74TBW5UWE	Sidehop	There's something about Japanese anime and especially Miyazaki's work that touches everyone from different cultures.The movie is very innocent and touching movie in so many ways.  It's a make you feel good movie with what one could see it as fantasy or obscured idea; like many movies Miyazaki has created in the past.  While you'll see no violence or any sort of passive aggressive behavior within like other children's shows today.  Just your normal life as a child and living with siblings.  Add Totoro who can only be seen by children and one that believe in him (or could be her) the story takes many twists until a little mishap occurs with the youngest girl.Totoro's been around since the late 80's but it's one of those classic anime's that just stays around for decades.  The music of the movie is also touching and it'll ring in your head often.  A must see movie if you have children 3+ age.  They'll be mesmerized...to the point of perhaps getting Totoro plush that I had to hunt down for our daughter one year.	5.0	Kids and adults will love this movie!	2012-01-21	0	0	0

In fact, this movie was prehaps my most random find ever, and what a find it was.Mei, age 4, and Satsuki, age 8, are two (very) energetic girls. They just moved out to the country to live in a rickity old house, without a telephone, under a camphor tree. Some people said that the house was haunted, but really, a lot of black soot just hang around there (very similar to the soot in Spirited Away). The girls' mother is in a hospital (presumably with spinal tuberculosis) and their loving father, a professor (I presume), lives with them.Mei meets a troll. Now, this ain't your big ugly Lord of the Rings troll or the mean, sly under-the-bridge troll: this is Totoro- the single coolest creature to ever be painted onto the silver screen. He is adorable, yes freaking adorable, but tough looking, and his tail, oh man, what a tail. It is difficult to transcribe into words how much I love Totoro and want him to be my neigbor.The animation is amazing. Nothing short of it. Just like in Spirited Away, some of the paintings look like very beautiful nature photographs. Totoro looks awesome. The girls' emotions are captured perfectly with the pen and easel.Now, typically, I hate kids in movies. They whine complain and say stupid things or act more mature than the adults. These children do neither. They act like real kids. They have real emotions and real problems. They have vibrant imaginations, but realistic problems. In other words, no movie I have ever seen before, better portrayed children.Get this movie.	5.0	One of the Best Animated Flicks I have Seen...	2005-05-13	12	10	2

My students have loved it for its ""cuteness"" and I've loved it for its numerous references to Japanese culture, especially having lived in Japan for a number of years. While some of the voices may be annoying, I like the fact that John Lassiter or Disney chose a more accurate translation of the dialogue. I love that its 'Satsuki"" (two syllables), not ""Sat soo ki"", which is an Americanized version of the correct pronunciation in the earlier Fox version. Even little things like explaining that the children were able to visit their mother on ""Rice Planting Day"" rather than just saying that they had a day off, is refreshing. While typical Americans have no clue what this means, I like that some viewers might learn a little bit about Japanese culture.

Every child I have shown this movie to has just fallen in love with it, not to mention many adults love it too. The movie is about two sisters (ages five and eight). Their family moves out to the country into a rickety old house. The girls mother is in the hospital a few towns over (not sure from what), so the girls are left in the care of their father. Shortly after they move into the house, the girls discover amazing things, most importantly, Totoro. Totoro is a forest spirit that only children can see. The plot is relatively simple, but it just brings you back to a time of innocence... a time when you could run around in the summer time all day long without shoes...a time when your imagination just ran wild. The character development is superbly done. You feel such a connection to the girls and their adventures in this movie. The animation is marvelous. I can't say enough about Miyazaki's artwork. He just has the best talent for capturing emotion and scenery so perfectly.  The dubbing from Japanese to English was very well done too.

They end up moving to a gorgeous countryside with their father and embark on very powerful adventures with a being named Totoro. The movie starts off ok, but the plot gets better as time goes by. Luckily for the Satsuki and Mei they happen to have a caring and open-minded father. Their professor father takes care of the girls with an abundance of love and patience while their mother is recuperating in the hospital. They end up experiencing some very spiritual adventures created from their very powerful and creative adventures. The beings that they meet are very loving and benevolent. I believe that the strong message of this story is that things are not always as they seem and one's imagination can open one up to the blessings and miracles of life. This movie will leave you with a smile on your face. My husband was unsure of watching the movie with me, but he too happened to enjoy the movie once he gave it a chance.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS	Stephen M. Lerch	This film has been completely redubbed in English (or WAS redubbed when it was released by Disney on DVD). Gone is the Fox dub, inserted is the Disney created dub that was on the Disney released DVD. This will be a never ending source of frustration for many fans given their love of the previous Fox dub over the Disney dub. If you want the original Fox dub, this is NOT the release for you.I don't listen or watch in English, instead choosing to watch in the original Japanese language which, thankfully, is the same as it has always been since the film was released back in 1988. Others wish to share this with their children, and having an English dub present they find pleasing is important. If you need this in English, I recommend you spot check the English track and decide during your return window if it is acceptable or not.My Neighbor Totoro is a movie about a university professor who moves himself and his two daughters to a remote village to be closer to their mother who is in the hospital. The film is non-confrontational. The only harrowing part of the plot is when the youngest daughter goes missing and the village go out to locate her. You can also say that the mother, whose illness is never really described, being in the hospital could be considered part of the angst, but the reality is that we are never given the feeling that the mother's illness is terminal.Totoro is a spirit living in the forest near their new home, and he winds up being a friend and ally of the two girls.Video:Outstanding. 1080p AVC encoded. This was digitally remastered, so the scratches and dirt were removed. You won't really notice any video related issues and this is a very good thing.Audio:You can listen to DTS-MA tracks of the Japanese, English and French versions of the film. The English language track is, as stated above, the re-created dub, not the original Fox/Troma dub many still wish to own. There are no audible issues with any of the tracks. It should be noted that these are STEREO tracks only. There is no surround mix included.Extras:Storyboards - you can watch the entire film in storyboards (w/ Japanese audio only, with optional English subtitles)Creating Totoro - this was an interview style piece with Miyazaki that was created for the original Japanese release. It is subtitled, though any of the bits with the film shown are shown with English languageCreating the Characters- Miyazaki discusses the process of creating the charactersThe Totoro Experience - retrospective on the release and it's troubled startProducer's Perspective: Creating Ghibli - very brief history of Studio Ghibli and how the name came aboutScoring Miyazaki - Joe Hisaishi discusses the Totoro, and other Ghibli, soundtracks that he scored.The Locations of Totoro - (SD) looks at Miyazaki's process for creating the world of TotoroBehind the Microphone - (SD) English dub actors are shown in the process of creating the English dub (and again, this is the Disney created dub only)Original Japanese Trailers - HD and SDOverall:I love Totoro. It's one of my all time favorite animated films. Ever.That being said, if you are looking for ground shattering extras, or the Fox/Troma dub, you will be disappointed with this Blu Ray release. The extras are good, but nothing amazing.If you are a Totoro fan, don't mind the Disney dub (or don't listen to it) and want audio and video quality that brings the film to life, and is presented in as close to perfection as it has ever been seen, then the Blu Ray is a worthwhile purchase.I'm happy I picked this up.	5.0	Blu Ray isn't perfect, but the film is amazing and the video is too	2013-05-28	6	6	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AL6U52M47C5YV	Stephen M. Vakil	This movie is teeming with creativity and magic, but ultimately does not transcend enough beyond a kid's movie at times.  I greatly enjoyed this film, moreso than any other film that I would classify as strictly for children.  There are scenes that remind us of what childhood is like, and other scenes which take us on a fascinating journey.  Yet it all ends to soon, with the usual song and dance we expect from a children's film.This is a great kid's movie, and one which most adults will enjoy.  However, if you are looking for more serious fare, try Princess Mononoke, a little more serious work with a lot more to offer the thinking movie-goer.	4.0	Outstanding children's tale;  good adult's tale.	2001-08-04	0	0	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2S0FCE1GYVKBT	"Steve ""metsfansince1962"""	My Neighbor Totoro is one of the most charming animated films ever made.  This DVD has no extras, no wide-screen option, and the image could be a bit sharper, but it is still pretty good.The artwork is superb--with beautiful countryside scenes, rippling water, rainy busstops, and trees blowing in the wind wonderfully done.  The fantastic spirit creatures (especially the totoros of varying sizes and the Catbus) are charming and clever.The human characters are warm and real--in their concern for each other and in their hopes and fears.  I liked the suspense that built up when the 4-year-old Mei tries to visit her mother in the hospital, gets lost, and the whole neighborhood searches for her.  Of course, her older sister, Satsuki, turns to King Totoro for help.  I also liked the magical, dream sequence when Totoro's acorns grow into a giant camphor tree and the children fly with Totoro to the treetops.Hayao Miyazaki produced a great film for children and their parents to enjoy together.  If the DVD was a bit better, I would give it 5 stars.	4.0	Great film--worth buying at this price.	2003-06-07	5	5	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	My Neighbor Totoro (animation, adventure, family)Directed by Hayao MiyazakiStarring the voices of Dakota Fanning, Elle Fanning, Tim Daly and Pat CarrollDisney / Buena Vista | 1988 | 86 min | Rated G | Released Mar 02, 2010The Film 5/5Unlike most of my previous reviews, My Neighbor Totoro hasn't yet been released on Blu-ray. Disney is working its way through the Studio Ghibli titles and has released most of them on DVD, but a Blu-ray release for this particular film is likely one or two years away. While I intend to own them all on the best possible format, I just had to buy Totoro on DVD until it sees a high definition release.This is going to be a difficult review because my love for Studio Ghibli and its worlds is hard to put into words. I'll do my best.Hayao Miyazaki's films aren't for everyone. They should be, but it just isn't the case. The reason is that we in North America have come to expect a certain style when it comes to animation.Animated movies are typically fast-paced and filled with action. They have heroes, villains, chase scenes and conflict. What's more, they are noisy. It seems that without constant action, there's a fear that the audience might become bored. This is not a criticism, merely an observation. I'm quite happy watching such things as Kung Fu Panda, Megamind, Tangled or How to Train Your Dragon.Miyazaki's films don't follow the typical Hollywood style. Until very recently, everything was hand-drawn. Each frame is like a watercolor painting and has a certain beauty. Those who only watch modern CGI animation may not appreciate the classic two-dimensional style.Another huge difference is the pacing. Instead of constant action, you'll see occasional shots of the countryside, a stream, an animal or clouds. It's a cultural difference and reflects a society in which people are more in tune with nature and the simple joy of being alive. Miyazaki's stories unfold gradually in their own time.Like most Studio Ghibli releases, Totoro doesn't contain any villains. We are shown situations that its characters encounter and have to figure out. It works because the characters are well-defined and we care about them. We want to see how they will proceed and whether they will succeed.The story is set in the 1950s in a Japanese village and begins with Professor Kusakabe (Daly) arriving at his new house, along with daughters Satsuki and Mei (Dakota and Elle Fanning). Satsuki is about 10 years old and Mei around 4. The sisters are delighted with their new home. Mei mimics her sister's actions and sometimes repeats what she says. I have never seen a more realistic depiction of how children think and behave.The children are full of life and explore their new house with excitement. It's rumored to be haunted, but they only encounter soot sprites which leave at the sound of laughter. The sprites are only visible to children. Another cultural difference is highlighted when the professor shares a bath with his daughters. His girls happily help with the chores before they run off to play. This is a world in which TV doesn't exist. The children spend their free time playing outside.Professor Kusakabe puts the girls on his bicycle and takes them to a hospital where their mother is being treated. Miyazaki's own mother suffered from tuberculosis and, although it's never stated, this is probably what Mrs. Kusakabe was recovering from. It's not typical for animated films to deal with such themes as illness, but this is a realistic world and the situation fits. They learn that she's almost ready to return home and see their new house.Satsuki cooks for the family and her father works at home when he's not lecturing at the university. It's a benign world where children walk to school without any fear of abduction or similar dangers.Mei isn't yet old enough for school and plays outside while her father works at his desk. She views the world with the charming fascination of a child, exploring her surroundings and watching tadpoles swim in the stream. Then she sees a pair of white ears in the long grass, belonging to a creature resembling a rabbit. The creature scurries away from her alternating between visible and invisible. She tracks it into a tunnel formed by overhanging trees. After entering a hole in the trunk of a vast tree she emerges in a clearing occupied by a giant sleeping creature.We are more than 30 minutes into the film before she encounters the sleeping totoro. The film takes its time and doesn't feel the need to introduce the creature from the start. It looks like a cross between a cat, a teddy bear and an owl. She prods it inquisitively and it seems unconcerned by her presence. There's no sense of danger and she simply curls up on top of it and falls asleep. Her father and sister notice she is missing and set out to find her. When they arrive, she's sleeping on the ground in the forest with no sign of the totoro.When she tells her unlikely story, her father and sister believe her. They accept that she wouldn't lie. It's very refreshing to see that kind of trust between adult and child. Professor Kusakabe speculates that the totoro can only be seen when he wants to be seen and that Mei was very lucky to have the chance. These simple words make her happy.The film defies our expectations at every turn. When her father has to go to the university, Mei starts to miss Satsuki, so the old woman looking after her takes her to the school. Satsuki explains to the teacher that their father will be home in a couple of hours and Mei is allowed to stay with the older children. She feels important and quietly sits at her desk drawing a picture of the totoro.I don't want to give away the whole story, but the totoro has an important part to play in the lives of the girls. The most worrying part of the film lasts about ten minutes, but it's a realistic situation and doesn't contain any villains. Their friend the totoro is a reassuring presence and knows how to solve the problem.The girls are very sweet, but it isn't overdone. Little Mei is probably my favorite character in any animated film. She's thoroughly adorable. Miyazaki's drawings are quite simple, but he can convey emotion with just a few expressions. He varies the size of the children's mouths and eyes according to the mood of the scene.My Neighbor Totoro is set in a world that no longer exists. The parents care deeply for their children and the two sisters love and depend on each other. Villagers pull together in times of crisis and care about their neighbors. Children respect older people and there's no sense of danger. It's a warm and happy place to visit and I wish the real world were more like Miyazaki's imaginary ones. This is what human beings are supposed to be like.Miyazaki has a wonderful imagination and it's even more prominent in fantasy worlds such as those encountered in Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Castle in the Sky and the Oscar-winning Spirited Away. All of his stories have warmth and heart. If you see him interviewed, it's apparent that he loves what he does. His enthusiasm is infectious and he smiles when he talks about his worlds. He sees things that most of us take for granted and miss altogether.I consider My Neighbor Totoro to be the perfect family film. It may also be the happiest film I've ever seen and the relationship between the sisters is wonderful to watch. They aren't constantly bickering. If Mei gets tired, Satsuki carries her. Adults treat children seriously and genuinely want to know what's important to them. In today's world, with the pressures adults place on themselves, that isn't always the case.Miyazaki has crafted a film filled with wonder and a sense of discovery. It's like returning to your childhood and seeing the world from that perspective. The expressions of concentration, determination and pure wonder on Mei's face are depicted perfectly. The film is full of beauty. I don't just mean the animation - although it is beautiful - I'm also referring to the actions performed by the people and creatures in the film.The feelings created by the story are considerably enhanced by Joe Hisaishi's haunting score. He's responsible for the music in all of Miyazaki's films and the two have established a good understanding. The melodies seem so simple, but it's hard to imagine the film without their presence.While I'm delighted that Disney is releasing the Studio Ghibli titles on Blu-ray, it can't happen fast enough. Some will argue that the English dub of the film ruins the experience. The good thing about the recent releases is that the original Japanese version is included as an option. If you want to experience the film in its native language, you can now do so, with or without subtitles.There's also a short film set in the same world; Mei and the Kittenbus. It hasn't been released commercially, but is sometimes shown at the Studio Ghibli museum in Mitaka, Japan. You'll have to reserve a ticket in advance if you want to pay a visit. It's a long trip to see a 14-minute short film, but it's currently the only way to see it. My forlorn hope is to see the short included among the special features when the film is released on Blu-ray.I would recommend Miyazaki's films to everyone, although I realize that some people won't connect with them. The potential reward is worth the time investment. If you have children, there's even more reason to give one a try. Try to go in with an open mind. My Neighbor Totoro isn't about constant action or conflict, but it's an experience that shouldn't be missed. It's closer to a film like Bambi than Megamind or Despicable Me.Just because a film is about young children, it doesn't mean that the viewer has to be a young child in order to appreciate the story. Pixar has elevated North American films to new levels over the past two decades, but I can honestly say that Studio Ghibli, and Miyazaki in particular, has produced films with more heart. They are beautiful, magical and full of imagination. These stories matter to me and I can't wait to see the next one.	5.0	He's come to deliver what you've lost	2011-06-02	5	5	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1LV42RTC8AHO6	Steven P. Thomason	"In recent years, many ""family films"" have not been enjoyable for the whole family. Instead of making them so that both the kids and the parents can enjoy them, they are often made so only the kiddies will enjoy them (I'm lookin' at YOU Nickelodeon). These films are loud, obnoxious, rude and simply unbearable. However, there are also a few family films that have been enjoyable for all ages. The most prominent examples being the films of Pixar and Studio Ghibli. Out of all of these films, this little gem, ""My Neighbor Totoro"", may just be the finest family film of all. The premise is simple: Two little girls with a sick mother move out to the country with their father, exploring the surrounding forest and interacting with the spirits that inhabit it, such as the big furry Totoro. That's pretty much it. While it doesn't sound like engaging cinema, it has a warm, touching atmosphere with an emphasis on the importance of family togetherness. While it is a fine family film, it is also a wonderfully experimental art film. Instead of relying on a conventional plot, it explores it's world with a childlike sense of wonder, taking life one step at a time. The human characters have surprisingly real personalities, and are somehow able to get along with each other for the most part. The spirits also fit surprisingly well into the realistic world, as if they really did exist. This film also has the most detailed and beautiful backgrounds you'll ever see in a film. The beautifully crafted plants make you want to go outside and explore nature (after you're done watching the movie, of course). One thing that really irks me however, is that many fans give this wonderful film one measly star, simply because they didn't like Disney's dub. Many people seem to prefer Fox's dub from the early nineties, but I don't see why. I haven't seen the whole film with the Fox dub, but all I know is this: The girls are voiced by adults (adults never sound like authentic children), the father has a deep, scratchy voice (COMPLETELY out of character), and Totoro and Catbus don't even have voices (SERIOUSLY?!? They had voices in the Japanese version, why don't they have them in the Fox dub?!?). Also, the cover art makes it look like one of those Disney musical rip-offs that were so common in the nineties. These are my opinions, anyway. One reason why I would say that Disney's dub is a better buy, is that it includes the original Japanese audio track, while the Fox dub does not. That way, if you really do dislike Disney's dub, or just hate dubbing in general, you can watch the film in it's original language without having to buy an overpriced import from Japan. Also, I don't think Disney's dub is as bad as anime snobs let on. This really is one of Hayao Miyazaki's best works."	5.0	A truly sublime film from the master of animation.	2009-06-11	6	6	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1AQDZS7SRP3YN	StudyingGirl	A friend recommended this movie for my daughter who was 3 at the time. It is beautiful. I love the artistic style of the Japanese anime. The storyline is not at all like the anime cartoons you see on tv like pokemon. It is more like a beautiful, nature-y aesthetic experience that creates memories in a child's mind and enriches a love for nature and family throughout their lives.In this movie the two sisters find acorns that were dropped by possibly imaginary gentle forest creatures (some giant, some not). They wait and wait for them to grow. At one point the smaller sister takes corn to their mother who is sick in the hospital.A few times during the movie I thought it might be too scary for such young children, but my daughter has never seemed scared by it. I feel that overall this movie has way more positive life-enriching moments to offer than those small complaints! Beautiful music the entire time with raindrop noises during the rain.If you like this one, check outNausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. It is rated G, but was created in the 1980's and is a little violent for my taste. However, the aspects of environmentalism and non-violence it teaches is quite possibly indispensable.Both movies are good for ages 4-10, as long as you review Nausicaa for violence ahead of time!	5.0	Beautiful way to grow up	2011-11-20	1	1	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A23Q1T4MXZHFM7	susumu-5	Hayao Miyazaki's 1988 film surely broadened the fans of his animation style from avid anime fans to wide range of ordinary audience. Also it is well-made marriage of his adventure-oriented animation and real-life oriented vivid one probably influenced by his long-time friend Isao Takahata.The drama setting seems to be during 50s when the landscape like Totoro's home was pretty unhurt. Satsuki and Mei(both meaning the fifth month of the year) moved from the city to suburban Kanto Area somewhere near Tokorozawa where Seibu Stadium(home to Seibu Lions a newbie Major league player Daisuke Matsuzaka formerly belonged) is located. Until the mid stage the drama turns bitter twist. Their mother's illness seems really bad. Little Mei tries to meet her mother in the hospital mountains away but gets lost. Then Totoro finds amazing way to search for Satsuki's stranded sister. Totoro must have come from legendary ghost but don't bother. Totoro is too cute to be a goblin.Miyazaki's work has well-made balance to avoid the drama turning so unreal. And the place used for the drama is almost intact and totoro fans now try hard in their National Trust Movement to preserve the home of Tororo.Verdict: Probably the nice introduction to Miyazaki/Ghibli works.Rating: 98 out of 100Recommended for: Wide range of movie goers.	5.0	Round Trip From Fantasy To Reality	2007-01-03	4	4	0

Even among anime and Miyazaki's other films, this one stands out.  It has a very, oh, how to phrase it?  Life charged, natural feel to it.  The setting is rural - deep in the country where no large cities exist.  Green hues and blue water dominate the color scheme.  The children romp and explore just like real children do.  It's downright uncanny how Miyazaki can do that.One warning though to parents : beware the bath scene.  That's all I will say about that one.  Just be on the lookout.Anyway, in watching this get ready for a rollercoater ride of pure imagination.  It's fresh, it's rural, it's about nature and it's very different.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A121WJCKYJ4T03	taka(Japanese	Tonarino Totoro is 3rd movie for Miyazaki. In Japan roadshow, the movie was showed with [Hotaruno Haka]. I like latter movie in the point that expressed the real story, the poverty of World War2. But the person's favorite movie will be different by individual tendency. I had the tendency that liked documental and truth story than fantasy story. Off course for young children or the person that like fantasy, Totoro will be the best movie. The two movie before Totoro was fantasy but war and agressive movies. Totoro was a first movie that there was not war scene. When we watch such a point, the movie will be safe movie that child can watch. And the character of Totoro is also very cute and unique, Totoro off course,[Neko bus=cat bass]etc.But Mr.Miyazaki did not forget to include his messages to this movie. Maybe foreigners would feel unique things in the movie atomospher, for instance, big forests or secret paassages etc. But there was such scenery in Japan in fact. And the sketch was done in Tokyo. Though I have lived in Tokyo more than 20 years, I have not cared about such scenery. Off course though what nature is losing will be truth, but in addition to that, I think that Miyazaki want to tell us that we should notice the nature, even if here is downtown city.The movie that Miyazaki make is included the important messages. Even if watcher is not Japanese, will be able to think about the messages. That is to say, nature is one of imoportant things for human.And I am surprised that many U.S,A people knew Miyazaki's movies. I can understand the reason that is said that Japan is anime country.I am sorry for my poor English.	4.0	Mr.Miyazaki's 3rd movie	2004-03-24	9	8	1
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A23UHUA27I0RPU	"Talya M. Bates ""Travel, food and anime"""	I am writing this review not only because I love the film but also in response to Paul F. Brown. The movie is not crystal HD clear but that does not detract from what is most important and that is the story. The actors that play the characters in the film are all perfectly cast and you find their emotions believable. I have rented the Disney version with its updated imaging. It looks wonderful but that version loses on its way of telling the story. Disney should have only opened it up for wide screen and improved the appearance. Instead they hired new actors to tell a story that did not need improvement. I think if you are going to purchase the DVD you should watch both versions before you commit to purchase. The voice of Satsuki in the Disney version sounds so mature it is not believable when she worries about her mother. Her voice is the voice of someone that is familiar with responsiblity and the innosence is missing. The same can be said of the actor that plays the younger sister Mei in the Disney film as well only not to the same degree. So in the end you will need to decide for yourself if the story is the most important to you or the graphics.	5.0	Story or Graphics	2009-02-28	2	1	1

They love each other, but don't let the love get in the way of fussing the way kids do.  The little, white, chicken-footed totoro is our family's favorite, poor thing being chased by May.  The story is very touching and the childhood magic of being able to see the soot-sprites and totoro captures the days before one grows up.My only complaint is that the DVD doesn't have and bonuses like so many do.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A39UXEYFJFFU37	TerriS	This version of My Neighbor Totoro is the Disney version. I didn't realize when I bought it that it wasn't the version I wanted. I wanted the original with the original voices. I e-mailed amazon and they were very helpful, especially because I couldn't tell based on the listing which voices were in this one. So, I returned the DVD and received a refund. The customer service was fantastic!I subsequently bought the FOX version which is the original, from an outside seller.	2.0	Not what I expected	2011-05-21	8	3	5
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A4NXA2IJNE10H	"Tetsu Uma ""The 'Iron Horse'"""	"Set in what I would estimate to be the late 50s or early 60s in rural Japan, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is the story of a family who relocates to the country and the wonderful mystical creatures they meet and the adventures they have.  The older daughter, Satsuki, is forced to be the woman of the house and watch her younger sister Mei (pronounced ""May"") while their mother is in a tuberculosis sanitarium.  Their adventures start with discovering ""Soot Sprites"" while moving in the house but the greatest discovery is their neighbor, Totoro, a giant furry forest spirit.  Totoro takes them on adventures with the magic seeds and helps Satsuki find Mei when she runs off and gets lost.  The girls are learning to face their fears and growing in the process.  This is a short description and I don't want to spoil the plot too much.  However, my favorite scene has to be when Satsuki meets Totoro standing in the rain at the Bus stop and gives him an umbrella.  Totoro discovers the loud sounds created when large drops fall off of tree branches.  In order to make more, he jumps up and down and brings down a deluge from the trees.  It makes me laugh just thinking about it.This is probably the cutest of the Studio Ghibli releases and was my (and I am sure many others) original introduction (in 1995) to the work of Hayao Miyazaki.  This early Studio Ghibli work helped set their high standard of excellence in animation.  The Disney release includes an English language version with the voice talents of Lea Salonga, Pat Carroll, Tim Daly, Dakota and Elle Fanning, and the Japanese language version with subtitles.  As is the case with most Studio Ghibli American releases, the translated Japanese dialogue is better than the English dialogue.Besides being a cute story, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" gives a good glimpse of rural Japan from that time period.  From the three wheeled truck and the house with the sliding wood doors to the family all riding on the bicycle and bathing together, this is what rural Japanese life was like and I have to say that my wife finds it a little nostalgic.Now, why did I give it only four stars.  There are two American releases for this DVD and the Amazon site posts reviews made for one version  version at both links.  The two releases are Disney and Fox.  I give 4 Stars for the Disney release.  Compared to the Fox release, the dialogue is only okay and I do not think the voice talent (the Fannings in particular) is as good as the voice talent in the Fox release.  Also, some of the music is literally straight out of Hanna Barbara.  (This background music may be from the original Japanese release.)  The additional features, particularly the Japanese language help make up for it in part but overall, I prefer the Fox version for sheer viewability.That having been said, I give the Fox release 4 stars as well.  I like the added features and the ability to watch the Japanese dialogue of the Disney release and these features are lacking from the Fox release.  Overall, the Fox release is easier to watch in my opinion.  Keep in mind, the Fox release is out of print but you may still be able to find a copy.This is a cute story and I consider it excellent for children as there is no violence and the creatures, while strange, are not particularly scary.  It usually draws rave reviews when I show it to children and adults enjoy it, too.  I highly recommend it."	4.0	A Charming Story for Children and Adults	2007-10-28	3	3	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AHV9Z1EDYO5WK	The Bruce	I saw this for the first time recently, what a warm and truly wonderful film. But when I went to find it on DVD I was appalled to find it only in pan-and-scan(!)I'm shaking my head that the studio feels they need to dumb down the format to appeal to preschoolers and their babysitters. I can hear the Totoro crying as I write...So what did I do? I went to Ebay and found the all-region Japanese pressing, in letterbox, with both English and Japanese audio. Don't encourage the studios by buying their full-screen monstrosities (sorry Amazon).	3.0	Stunning film but poor mastering............	2003-01-07	19	18	1
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A34RDZS6AKJRHR	Theodore Csernica	"I'm afraid I have to join the chorus about the Disney dub. It's simply awful.  It's impossible to blame the child actors for a job poorly done, especially when the same thing is wrong with all the other voices. There's no emotional range to speak of. There's either happy and silly or screaming and crying; what should be in a wide range in between for much of the film is instead flat and toneless. It's impossible to enjoy. If if were not for the original Japanese track, the Disney DVD would be completely worthless. (I haven't investigated the special features yet.) Did the voice director not understand what the lines meant? Or did he simply not care? This is too bad, because in some ways the translation is superior to that used for the Fox version. It could have been much better.  As it is, I regret not paying the premium for the Japanese edition, which would have played perfectly well in my multi-region DVD player.They were able to use substantially the same translation of the lyrics for the beginning and end sequences, but for some reason they were sung by a ""musical stylist"". It really messes things up for my 7-year-old, who loves sing along and belt the words out. (I still don't like ""badger"" for ""tanuki"". They're not the same animal, and both are equally unfamiliar to most modern American children. But the lyrics translation is well done overall, so I can't really complain.)Update: I've now looked at the second disc in the set. All it has to offer is storyboards. If you're expecting a full set of content just because this is a ""2-disc set"", you need to lower your expectations."	4.0	It's Totoro all right, but...	2006-03-20	4	2	2

We had no idea what we were in for, but not one of us was disappointed. If fact, the whole family has watched Totoro at least 10 times since we bought it only a 2 months ago. My daughter espcially cannot get enough of it. It is very fun, heart warming and humorous. We recommend every family get a copy of this movie. You won't regret it.

There is no better living Film director than Miyazaki and with every feature it grows truer and truer. Totoro is a wonderful film the whole family can enjoy and it has the incredible ability to lift spirits at all times.The Fox edition of this DVD is shabby and worthless. There are no special features, it's in Full Screen (which is not it's original theatrical aspect ratio), and the english dub A. Blows and B. Is the only available viewing option. This is a travesty and a diservice to this great film. Fear not however because Disney is releasing a new two-disc special edition in the same veign as Porco Rosso, The Cat Returns and Nausicaa.If you can't wait to get your Totoro fix then i reluctantly recommend this DVD, but it's not a fair representation of this beautiful film. I bought it for five dollars at borders (After I used a coupon that gave me 25% of the purchase.) Other than that sort of circumstance do not buy this DVD...especially not so close to the Disney release (They did a spectacular job with the afformentioned films and Spirited Away..hopefully they will be re-dubbing Totoro with better actors.)	3.0	Wonderful movie...horrid DVD	2005-06-22	5	5	0

There is no violence.  The only antagonists are situations that cause the family concern for eachother.  Very small children may be upset when a little girl is lost, though nothing bad happens to her as a result.  Parents should be aware that there is a scene in which a father is taking a bath with his daughters, a cultural difference that made preteens somewhat uncomfortable.  Christian parents may not appreciate the idea of honoring spirits and similar ideas typical of Ghibli movies.  Overall, however, the movie is very good -- an excellent choice for family viewing.	4.0	Great for children and preteens	2009-01-19	1	1	0

This version of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" features excellent video quality as well as a very well done English audio track for those who wish to avoid reading subtitles.As with all Studio Ghibli productions the animations and the artwork are a pure joy.  What is different are the story elements and lack of PG material commonly found in the other Studio Ghibli titles.

If you have two children close in age, you will see their relationship mirrored in this animated film.  The imagination, the mystery, the wonder, and the vulnerability of childhood is captured nicely, probably the adults appreciate this more.  But there is plenty for children to enjoy, especially when the humor escapes us adults but makes perfect sense to children.  My children, both girls, ages 8 and 6 laughed through out the film and could relate to the story and the characters.  Miyazaki is wonderful for making stories and characters complex and delves into the gray areas that other children's animated films dare not venture.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1ROZAS13XR7B6	tone	First let me say that I love the movie My Neighbor Totoro!  The problem I have is with this Disney version of the movie.  After watching the original version of this movie, in English, on VHS countless times, I wanted to get the DVD version due to the VHS picture deteriorating.  I did not know that not only did they change the voice actors on the Disney version, but they also changed the script.  The changes are subtle, but noticeable.  If you never watched the original VHS version of this movie then you probably will not mind these differences.  But for me, after watching less than a half hour into the movie, I could not watch it anymore.  I really don't know why companies have to do this, but I hate when they do.  I can mention some other anime series where the original was better that the revised editions.  I say leave the originals alone!!  I'll probably end up sending this one back or trading it in.  I will always love the Totoro movie, but will stick to watching the original VHS version instead.  Nice try Disney, but no.  I hope the other versions of the Miyazaki movies released by Disney are not like this.  I have the VHS copy of Kiki's Delivery Service and will compare it to the Disney DVD version that I purchased recently along with the My Neighbor Totoro movie.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed they are the same otherwise I will be very disappointed by Disney again.	1.0	Very Disappointed!!	2012-02-11	4	2	2

My Sony Blu-ray player upsamples well to my 1080p screen, though I wish this film and Spirited Away would have been released on Blu-ray.  The only downside to this film is, without spoilers, is the topic for the final climax-drama seems a little drawn-out and when it's resolved you don't feel like there has been some major character development, just that things are back to normal.  One trivial point that will interest a tiny minority is there is a scene with the two girls bathing with their father (open bathing is normal in Japan and the film clearly stays G or PG here); luckily my daughter didn't bring up the ""why can't we take baths together"" question, which could have led to an endless stream of difficult questions.I probably should give it 4 stars because lack of availability of Blu-ray - I don't buy anything on DVD anymore because I know it will become obsolete - and because charging twenty bucks for a DVD with animation done in 1988 is just abusive.  However, this film make my daughter happy again and again, so it's probably worth it."	5.0	great story	2012-09-20	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1GRMNWTFQFG66	trespasserswilliam	The original version is streamline.If you are looking for the original version to replace your videotape that's going bad from so much use do not buy this one!!  It will be a huge disappointment to you and your children.We bought this version for quite a bit of money in the new box set from Disney in order to replace our old video tape and felt totally betrayed.  I usually like Dakota Fanning and I feel bad saying it, but the magic is missing from this version.There are definitely issues with the translation in the old version, but the charm and similarity to how actual sisters act is gone.This is an amazing movie in both versions, but it does not change the fact that the version my kids grew up watching was what we were looking for.  We had a VHS tape that finally died and I was only looking to replace it.  If I had know about this problem I wold have looked for a used cd instead.I am sure any kid who grows up with the newer version will prefer it to the Streamline version, so if you do not have mine or my kids' prejudice you are probably going to love it, and I am sure you will love it as much as my kids and I love the version we are used to.  In fact, I have heard that the reason for the changes have something to do with the Streamline translation having been changed from what Miyazaki had originally approved of.  So maybe it is closer to his vision and better in that way.  And maybe that explains some of the problems with the old translation I mentioned previously.	1.0	Not the original English version!!!- and not nearly as good!	2010-01-05	54	25	29
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A6NUKPTR0LINC	Trina Enriquez	My roommate has Totoro posters plastered on our bedroom walls, and having no prior experience with anime, I just poked fun at how silly they looked. To me, Totoros resembled these big blobs with blank stares.Now that  I've watched the film, however, I've done a 180 and am fast becoming a  Totoro fan. I found myself giggling with Mei, and I love the scenes when  she chases Chu and Chibi around the yard, and pokes Oh's tail to elicit  that rubber ducky sound before dozing on his soft, furry belly. As my  roomie said, if only I could have a big, fluffy Totoro to sleep on--they  just look so soft!I marvel at the imagination it takes to think up a  many-legged Catbus and creatures like Oh who balance on tops and carry  passengers like Velcro as they whoosh through the night. I only wish there  were more scenes with Chu and Chibi.	5.0	A recent convert	2000-04-17	0	0	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	Since the first theatrical release in Japan, I have been a devoted fan of this film, and Totoro and two sisters' wonderful, magical, fascinating tale in rural Japan is my all-time best.And if you think this film is just for kids only, trust me, it is not.  Now I'm a grown-up, but still can enjoy watching it.  Two lovable sisters are always well-drawn and credible while three furry monsters &quot;Totoro&quot;s (lovely creatures, indeed) are nothing but charming.  And these things many fans have said rightly.  Now I could add some reasons for the enormous popularity, especially popularity in Japan.As you know after watching the opening scenes, this animation uses the countryside of Japan as its background.  Sadly, these beautiful country is now becoming a past memory even for Japanese people.  We no longer see conducters (guides) on local bus service; no good old three-wheeled trucks can be seen (on which sisters' father was seen), and school buildings are modernized so little chance for you to see Satsuki's school in reality.  These facts, beside its good story telling, make the film all the more charming for us, Japanese.On top of that, many adult viewers surely remember the way they acted like spies when they were kids; made their own story of adventure, fought against imaginary creatures, and so on.  Yes, we see even our autobiography in it sometimes.  Have you ever experienced a childlike. thrilling sensation of finding a hidden passage in a house where you newly moved?  Have you lost your way amid the places you had never been, and felt scared of the coming sunset as a child?  I have, and all those memories would spring back to my mind vividly while watching &quot;Totoro.&quot;Of course, kids enjoy this film, but it is something more as director Hayao Miyazaki's films always are.  Creatures are cute, 12-legged cat-bus is infallably the favorite and wonder for kids, and three &quot;Totoro&quot;s always steal your eyes.  Now remember, &quot;Totoro&quot; is much more than that.  Kids can enjoy it, and so can adults.  Definitely.By the way, something about sisters' names.  &quot;Satsuki&quot; is the old, elegant way of calling the fifth month of the year; hence, meanig &quot;May.&quot;  So, the sisters' names mean virtually the same thing, the best time of year of Japan.	5.0	Loved by Many Fans in Japan and the Whole World	2001-11-11	8	7	1
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AP8HCMDVAFPXP	TwoTooth	I made the mistake of removing the wrapping before looking at the details on this DVD, so I can't return it even though I haven't watched it and won't. I also made the mistake of buying this without checking out the reviews. This is not the original version of the film. It's dubbed (no original audio) and equally bad, it's been violated with the completely unnecessary pan and scan. Come on, America, even on my 9-inch TV, I'd rather see a film in its original aspect ratio. This goes into my white elephant heap.	1.0	Buyer beware	2003-01-16	14	10	4
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2OCJNB6B46OKP	"Underground Reborn ""gnome"""	In the history of animation all the way until today Disney has shined above the rest with the brining to life of classic stories. While there are other companies out there that try to succeed most of them seem to fade into the background. 'An American Tale', 'The Land Before Time' and 'The Iron Giant' are just a few.In 1988 in the peak of American animation Miyazaki created 'My Neighbor Totoro'. It is the story of two sisters that move into a new house that they feel is being watched by spirits. Being the adventurous girls they are, they find that there is a something there and it's big! Once they find it an incredible world of wonderous adventures begin and their lives will never be the same.' My Neighbor Totoro' was such a wonderful film. I was captivated by the complexity of the characters in such a simple story. It really stands up there along with some of the great Dinsey classics, which is no surprise that Disney got their hands on it. Still, in my opinion try and get your hands on the origional english dubbed film from Fox family animation. The voices are much better especially with Cheryl Chase (voice of Rugrats Angelica) as the voice of the adorable and spunky Mae. You will laugh until it hurts and just stare in amazment of all the fantastic moments that will captivate you in this adorable family film. It will probably end up on your top 10 list if you're not careful.	5.0	A delightful family film. (Volume 1: Part 3)	2008-06-08	2	2	0

So many movies lose thier magic once you get older but this one didn't. The animation is absolutely flawless and Totoro is as cool now as ever.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1Y8FBJLVK6LS9	Wayne A.	"I'll recheck this but (as Amazon states) I'm certain the two-disc set contains original Japanese language with an English subtitle option (along with English dub). The debates about this video seem to focus on this issue. Amazon tends to print the same reviews for differing versions of a same title and it can get really perplexing at times--in one case two entirely different movies that happened only to share the same title shared reviews. I wrote to Amazon about this but never received a response.With that out of the way (and I think with little need to stress the fact that this is a spectacular family film), let me be an advocate of one approach here. Even if you're showing this to children (and please, watch this with them, you'll be delighted), make every effort to watch it in the original Japanese, with subtitles, and read for them if needed. Reasons are:A) As much as I hate to admit it, I now never find much merit in American dubbings of any film. The reason is that once a foreign film gets into the hands of American producers, they feel a need--sometimes a subtle and well-intended one--to ""Americanize"" the film. There's nothing innately bad about this but almost always, if you go to the original and listen very carefully to the emotions and inflections of a language you may not even understand, you'll find that the original film makes much more ""emotional"" sense than the American version. Anything Disney does is particularly suspect since it tends to operate (to its financial detriment, we've noticed) in High-Power Marketing Mode nearly all of the time so it will try to go for ""names"" in dubbing rather than pay strict attention to artistic needs*. I've worked with Disney on some projects and frankly they need someone to talk to them and help them get back to another world of magic entirely.B) Kids, more than anyone, pick up on the emotional content of language and will, if you give them the chance, find more of value in the original language films, even if subtitles may be a minor barrier. This is also the best way to start them on a path of appreciating other cultures and non-American film product which (even I'm now realizing) is often of finer artistic merit.C) The Japanese, with an ancient theatrical traditional, field spectacular actors and the voice talent that turns up in these movies is often as good as can be hoped for. This particular film is beautifully acted. In what I've encountered, Japanese actors generally portray finer ranges and nuances of emotion and manage gentleness and innocence particularly well. Your kids will pick up on this.*The recent ""Howl's Moving Castle"" used Billy Crystal for the voice of the Fire Demon. Listen to the original and compare. Crystal was brilliant in Monsters Inc.--the part being pretty much written for him--but here he's sadly under-utilized and his wise-crack delivery is more than a little out-of-place. Disney really tried too hard to pack this one with ""names."""	5.0	Amazon makes things confusing!	2006-08-10	7	7	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A299CNER8FKTTR	"wdhyte ""Dave"""	"well if you've read all these reviews you've had quite a bit of eye strain and opinion (along with some notable facts I might add). For me, I couldn't wait to get this to share it with my 2 1/2 yr old daughter and she loves it. I first saw this when I lived in Tokyo in the early 90s and it captured my heart (and everyone elses) BIG time. There were Totoro stuffed animals everywhere (along with all the Hello Kitty's you see before we (America) bastardized the meaning of them too). Anyway, having first seen it in Nihon-go, I am partial to that version and the sound of their voices...some of the translation isn't exact either but it's close enough to work and not detract from the story. It seems though that a lot of people have missed that this is OLD RURAL Japan...not current day...I would guess this is around or just before the start of WWII. That aside, I too have to take exception to the sounds for both Totoro and Neko-basu...Totoro is not ferrocious nor is the bus a ""Stitch"" clone. I'm OK with the rest of the voices for the most part but if you've not see the original, then these comments may well be lost on you. No biggy anyway. Just enjoy it for what it is...the beauty and spirit of Japan and of children. This is Japan's ""mother nature"" or ""mother earth"" or whatever you want to think of it as.Now if we could just teach them to NOT eat whale...  ;-)...Dave"	4.0	Totoro is great and my toddler loves it	2006-06-11	4	2	2
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A13Y1WNMYX93EL	wearingclothesperson	I'd never seen this film before, but I bought it because I'm a Miyazaki fan. I loved this film, sure, but not as much as say Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away (all highly recommended). I attribute this to the age of the protagonists: Mei is four and Satsuki has to be like eleven or twelve. I had the same problem with Ponyo; the younger protagonists don't connect much with me because I'm older, but I still love the films; I guess I'm just old now (mid-twenties crisis).The story was nothing like I expected. The silly forest spirits are actually more of a side plot to what is happening in the story. Moments of depression, despair, and panic can be found alongside feelings of joy, laughter, and annoyance (I mean their dad is just, why are you, man I wanted to slap him several times just because of his dialogue). Again, feel-good dialogue can be found throughout which makes me, and probably Patton Oswalt, scrape at our flesh and squeal.Why bring Patton into this? Because he did the voice of Remy in Ratatouille, and he expressed in a stand up act that he struggled to tolerate little children and happiness. It made him die a little inside. Totoro's dialogue is just too much sometimes; it's too happy-go-lucky-punch-me-in-the-face-with-butterflies-and-cake. I love this film, I do, but that cheesy dialogue probably indicates I'm too old for this now (oh God why I can't believe this).	5.0	He looks like a rabbit, but they call him a troll	2014-05-26	0	0	0

The voices barely match the lips and the dialogue is so dumbed down it is hard to follow the story.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	AIJJB21124MW3	William of Florida	"Miyazaki's films always amaze me with the grasp on scenery, detail and the depiction of human nature. Everything is just so well orchestrated in this film, right down to the catchy music that plays white the Totoro is flying.I have to admit something however. For years I hated most anime and foreign animation in general. It was just in the last few years that I've opened up to more of it. This was mostly out of my desire to appriciate all forms of animation (myself an aspiring cartoonist). I discovered in this time that the reason I wouldn't give any of it a chance was not the fault of the cartoons or their animators, but rather of the fanboys. Not fanboys in general, but the ones that hate all other forms of animation other than anime simply because other animation isn't anime. I'm sure if you went to high school in a heavily populated area, you know exactly what I'm talking about.Please, don't let annoying people keep you from enjoying the animation of other cultures. Almost every area of the world has great animated features that get overlooked (Triplets of Belleville is good for example). You will be amazed at how much more enjoyable a great cartoon is once you have seen the different ways it is utilized for storytelling. It's very inspiring.And inspiring is the word that I think best suits how I feel about My Neighbor Totoro, This was the second full length anime movie I ever sat down and watched (Spirited Away was first). Immediately I was blown away at the attention to color, atmospheric sounds, just everything. The film really conveys the feeling of the world it depicts. What really impressed me was the depiction of people. They aren't vicious or melodramatic or stupid for the sake of comedy. The little girls are portrayed as two happy, laughing kids enjoying life. The kinds of kids you might yell ""settle down"" to. The problems they face in the film affect them in ways that they might affect normal kids.Then there's the Totoro's. I swear, the animators this an amazing job of making the main Totoro look lovable and warm and fluffy, yet intelligent somehow. You don't really get too much background on the Totoro or the wonderfully designed catbus, but the characters all fit very well in their respective scenes.The story itself is kind of different. It follows the standard hero arc in a sense, but in a much more subtle way. This movie follows a few days in the lives of two girls, in which they experience a kind of growth (as symbolized by the growing of plants, etc. in the movie). There is no physical villain or epic battle to speak of. Just a sweet and good hearted story. If you don't really get it while you're watching it, don't worry, it will grow on you in the days to come.All of this said, while this film is definately a really good one, it's not Miyazaki's best. But it's a great start if you're looking for an introduction to his style or even just a good movie you can watch with the kids or by yourself or whatever.Five out of five in any case.-Matt"	5.0	The Beauty of Simplicity	2008-02-19	2	2	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2VJCYKSTCKJNZ	"Willow Polson ""writer and whatnot."""	What can I say that others haven't? Not much... this film by the now famous Miyazaki is charming, endearing, touching, warm, cozy, magical...As a Pagan woman with a son who was 4 when I got it for him, the film got a lot of play in my home. But unlike so many insipid (or boring, or simplistic, or...) children's videos that haunt the living rooms of the world, My Neighbor Totoro goes so much deeper and enters a world of mystery and beauty, fright and pain, sacrifice and friendship. Parts of the film make my hair stand on end no matter how many times I see them, especially the night scene when the girls and totoros make seeds grow into a huge tree in a few seconds. The Japanese Shinto religion is alive in this film, with tree spirits still being honored and various shrines dotting the landscape. The simple details of a 1940s Japanese countryside are so immersive that I feel I've been there myself.The totoro spirits are an invention of Miyazaki, but it's impossible not to believe they exist out there somewhere, perhaps under the huge, moss-covered trees... Miyazaki said that he doesn't like hearing that kids are watching the film over and over... that he intended the film to be seen only once because the story is so ephemeral, a fleeting bit of magic only glimpsed for a moment in the realm of childhood. But I can't help myself... I must see Totoro over and over... I have a Totoro calendar on my desk right now...Absolutely one of the best anime films ever made, and one of the best children's films ever made.

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1C9OWE15I45F	Writer Mom	I first saw this film in 2004.  I'm a voice-actor and was going to be voicing an anime series.  I asked around to see what the best films and series were and, of course, Myiaskai's films were highly recommended.  I instantly fell in love with this film and it started me on the journey of seeing all of the films produced by Studio Gibli.  I now have a 2 year old son and bought it to share with him, although I fell in love with it as an adult.  It is my favorite film of any genre (not just children's).  Give it a watch, then start your own Myisaki collection!	5.0	My favorite film	2008-11-09	1	1	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1OXK7DED37ZR3	Wylie Cox	A marvelous, wonderful film.  Soundtrack, cinematography, everything.  Just so folks know, the setting is early 1950s Japan, before the old landscape was destroyed to make way for urbanity, which was the calculated solution for the political turmoil.  This was also a time in Japan when the incidence of tuberculosis was increasing dangerously.  Miyazaki's mom was in the hospital with TB, so this film is slightly autobiographical.  But the world it depicts is, sadly, mostly gone -- gone with Totoro's wind.	5.0	Gone with the wind	2007-02-07	6	6	0

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A315JRQQC4VBWD	YC	A heart warming tale about two girls who moved to the country with their father so that they can be closer to the hospital where their mother is being treated. Miyazaki is a master at creating a world through simple, beautiful animation that even in the mundane context of living in the country in an old house, magical creatures and wonderful discoveries can happen - that wonder that we all tend to lose as we get older. The movie connects with kids of all ages. We featured it for our New Year's eve family get together and literally, the kids who were 4, 6, 9, and 12 were all laughing and fully engaged. They are still talking about specific scenes. A must have for the family library.	5.0	A world of wonder, innocence, and love captured like no other!	2013-01-04	0	0	0

All of Miyazaki's films are wonderful and unique, particularly if you are sick of the ""same old"" in all other animation where ""good fights bad, good wins, and everything is wrapped up neatly in the end.""  Sometimes things just ""are."""	5.0	Sick of sappy Disney? Totoro is a great family movie!	2005-01-25	15	13	2

6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A2B8GXSCB1R05T	Zack Davisson	"There is hardly a ""Top 100 movies"" list that does not include ""My Neighbor Totoro.""  (The recent AMC list is an exception to this, as it only included American films.)  Roger Ebert has it on his ""100 Great Movies"" list.  Akira Kurosawa considered it one of the best films ever made.  It is really, really that good.Miyazaki's fantasy works on so many levels, it is almost impossible to classify ""My Neighbor Totoro.""  It is a straight kids flick that could be shown to any child.  I would happy invite my Grandmother over to watch it.  I would pop it in to watch with my wife.  It is funny, touching, cute, dramatic and pretty much everything else.I recommend that you give ""My Neighbor Totoro"" a try, even if you don't think that you will like it.  I was put off for years by the bad box-cover art and the simplified synopsis.  When I finally watched it, all I could say is ""Wow.""  Do yourself a favor.  Watch this movie."	5.0	One of the best films ever made	2002-04-10	4	3	1
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A18RJ91B28WFJ2	zebrastripes	My Neighbor Totoro is the most beautiful and wonderful animated movie I have ever seen in my life. I have a soft spot for rich animated movies but these days it is rare for me to discover one. No matter what animated movies will be released in the future, My Neighbor Totoro will be the one I come back to watch and treasure. I was introduced into anime at a young age with Pokemon and Sailor Moon. While my interest in it did continue throughout my childhood, I did not end up an anime nerd my entire life. But when I do see or hear about an excellent anime film ~ I want to watch it. I prefer Studio Ghibli films over Dreamworks and Disney. The animation is beautiful and sways to the air instead of being blocky and the stories do not follow the generic plot structure. But more about this later.When my sister was 5 and I was 10, my mother was diagnosed with a tumour in her brain. We were scared and confused for her and just wanted things to be back to normal. Our parents and family would talk in private whispers and the wait for her surgery felt like forever. Looking back, I feel so terrible for my mother and what she must have went through with her children being so young and not knowing exactly what to expect. When the time for her surgery came around it was delayed and I was absolutely devastated. What was supposed to be over, was prolonged. Finally, her surgery took place and everything was successful. Now, 8 years later, she is completely healthy and I am off to college and my sister is in middle school becoming an amazing girl's hockey player.Because of this, this movie has an extreme connection with me. It takes place in the country of Japan with two young girls and their father. Their mother is in the hospital and is too sick to live with them in their new brand new home at the moment. To help deal with the pain, Totoro, real or imaginary is not specified, comes to help the girls out and bring happiness and wonderment in their lives. Totoro is a cuddly half squirrel and half cat that you cannot help but be fond of. Later on in the film, the mother is supposed to arrive back home but becomes too sick and the arrival is delayed. The youngest girl is devastated and runs away. Her sister must find her with the help of Totoro and the Cat Bus, another adorable character. Watching this movie, I felt the pain that these girls went through. When the little girl cries over her sick mother not being able to come home, I cried too. And by the end of the movie I was in tears. A movie has never made me cry like this one. A movie that can affect your emotions this well is a powerful one.Unlike most animated movies, My Neighbor Totoro has no bad guys or clear plot. The two daughters are not like Disney Princesses. They are not striving after a boy, while a neighbor does have a little crush on the older sister one, and they use their imagination to create a wonderful world in the beautiful country of Japan. Actually, we do not know if the creatures in this film are their imagination. As far as we know, they could be real. And I think that helps bring even more magic and wonderment to the movie. The score and songs played in this film are absolutely adorable and should appeal to both children and older audiences.When I have children, I will be showing them this animated film. More movies directed to children should be created with this amount of intelligence, heart, and beauty. When an adult makes a movie for a younger audience they need to understand they are not dumb. If an intelligent adult is going to like it, a child is going to like it too. My Neighbor Totoro will forever have a place in my heart.	5.0	the most beautiful animated movie I have ever seen in my life	2013-08-21	3	3	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A37RD19G9W5ALV	Zelda Skye	What a disappointment this DVD was when I shoved itin my player. The facade of this movie was a favourite from my childhood, but what a rude awakening I received. They may have remastered the animation, but they also had the gall to redo the voices which was an absolutely horrific choice. Not only was it a major disappointment because it's not what I expected to hear, but I felt the voices failed to capture the intent of Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki or connect to the characters themselves in their American ways. Do not be fooled by the cover and think this is the original. It's not. That was my mistake. Don't let it be yours.	1.0	The unfortunate and unexpected	2008-06-18	11	7	4
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	Z Hayes	"I wanted to share my love of Miyazaki's animated features with my 5-year-old, but I wanted to make sure it would be appropriate for her. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" proved to be delightful and engaging, perfect for a young child.The story is simple and sweet without being overly cloying. A father and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei move to the countryside whilst their mother recovers from an illness in the hospital. There, the sisters discover that their home is haunted by benign spirits and the younger sister Mei discovers a creature named Totoro which is a forest spirit (he looks like an oversized bunny). Totoro is a sight to behold - his large appearance and loud growls belie a gentle nature, one which is in harmony with Mother Nature. One night, as the sisters wait for their father at the bus-stop, older sister Satsuki finds Totoro standing beside her in the rain. The sisters then witness an unusual sight - a cat which is also a bus, which looks like it was inspired by Lewis Carroll's Cheshire cat!There are no villains in this charming and engaging story, and I found that quite refreshing (why should there be villains in children's stories, they'll learn the harsh realities of life soon enough!).  Even the mother's illness is vague and not a real cause for concern except perhaps in the later part of the story when Mei goes missing trying to find the hospital her mother is in. My daughter could not get enough of Totoro and begged for repeated viewings. She loves the giant, endearing creature and would watch with rapt fascination each time Totoro appeared on screen.I loved the gentle ecological message of being in harmony with nature - Totoro bequests a gift of  seeds to the sisters which they plant in their garden. This is a sweet movie perfect for little ones and also older viewers - a show that can be enjoyed by the entire family."	5.0	Possibly the sweetest of Miyazaki's films	2010-07-08	5	5	0
6303118240	My Neighbor Totoro [VHS]	A3TLIP9GOPW5G9	Z. Jensen	Regardless of where in the world you are from, if you have seen My Neighbor Totoro you will hold it near to your heart. It's as iconic in Americas pop culture as it is in Japan. With references conspicuously placed in such shows and films as the Simpsons, Bob's Burger, Toy Story 3, and Comedy Central's  Drawn Together there is no denying it's effect on animation and story telling. The new Blu-ray version opens up this classic to a whole new generation. The audio/video remastering make this film on par with any current release today. If you do not own this film you need to.	5.0	A Classic Animated Film	2013-07-11	4	3	1
