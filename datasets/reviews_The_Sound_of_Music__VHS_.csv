Older people (I say that with the highest amount of respect)will probably enjoy along with young kids and Julie Andrews fans.	3.0	classic musical	2005-07-25	13	3	10
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1AOIRFI48Z2DZ	1970 Mach 1	I own the original tape when it first came out.  Then the DVD.  Both were kind of wash out in color.  When i learnt that the color was enhanced in this Blu-Ray version, I decided to buy it too.  Color is vibrant, whatever they did to enhance the video work well.  It is like a new experience once again watching this classic.	5.0	The Sound of Music	2014-05-09	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AVHN134ADVP4R	"A4Q96 ""Gadget Lover"""	The Sound of Music --My kids became addicted to this movie during a weekend with their grandparents, and have been asking to get it since.  We finaly caved and bought the remastered version.  The remastered version is beautiful - great colors, sound, extras, etc.  Nice not having to change it out at intermission as well :)What's not to like? Great film, kid friendly, wonderful music.The story is well told - predictable but still holds your attention all the way through.  Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are, as they usually are, a treat.  The Von Trapp kids, though, (most with no acting experience) are a revelation.  The fact that they went on to do comparatively little in the world of film and song makes it all the more amazing.The music is wonderful - how many movies have so many classic songs in them (These are a few of my favorite things, Edelweiss, Do Re Mi, etc.)?  Add the beautiful scenery, interesting plotline, and Julie Andrews/Christopher Plummer and it's is complete.I watched this many times growing up, and enjoy it more than ever with my kids.  The Sound Of Music is a must have/can't miss to add to your DVD collection.	5.0	Great movie, great version.  What's not to like?	2010-05-26	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3HDTCHYAXDKZX	Aaron Pacentine	I have not yet seen the DVD of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; but I know it has a ton of thing, when it will be coming out Aug 29, 2000. I have ordered a copy of the DVD from amazon.com  The movie is timeless because of  the music it brings into your life, just like the songs do. It's full of  happiness and joy and most of all it shows the love of a family and the  care that they show for one another. I have seen the VHS tape and watch it  at different times when it has aired yearly on NBC. It's a great musical  for the entire family. If you have not seen it yet, buy a copy before it's  too late. It's the greatest gift of all, if you are looking for a family  musical! Buy it for your friend or for yourself today!	5.0	WONDERFUL SOUND OF MUSIC	2000-07-30	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1TV21A2FPD2P2	a Believer	The Blu-ray is stunning!  I have other blu-ray discs that are basically mediocre, from what I have learned it all depends on how much money the studios want to spend when doing the transfer, they spent the money on this one.  Great movie, wonderfully acted with superb singing and timeless songs.I've read some reviews where the buyer says the discs won't play.  I've experience first-hand where one bluray player won't play a disc but another player will.  The technology is not perfect.  If a disc won't play there's a 99% chance it is NOT the disc but it IS the player.  At least in my experience.	5.0	Best Blu-ray I own!	2013-12-04	1	1	0

My family loves watching this movie, and we have listened to the cd several times. The reprint of 1965 Theatrical Souvenir Book and the post cards are beautiful, and the little music box adds a nice touch. Everything came packed in a beautiful collector's case.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A38YPNUFQJ69SN	"A. Bradford ""shopping expert"""	Seeing is believing, this Blu Ray is breathtaking in so many scenes. The scenes in the Abbey were so crisp I felt like I was 10 again seeing the film for the first time on the big screen in an early 70s revival. Salzburg has never looked this good. You can even see the delicate patterns in the tweed jackets.The audio is music to the ears (don't shoot me for the bad pun please). The 5:1 sounds studio quality again.Did anyone else have a crush on Christopher Plummer the first time you saw the movie?	5.0	Blu Ray Sound of Music stunning picture	2010-11-08	6	6	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AIGHHFJAXWXXZ	a_coke4u	Story : Based on a true story, a nun (Maria) filled with wonders is assigned to the Von Trapps family as a matron. Maria at first sees the coldness between the relation ship with the father and his children; for the wife Von Trapp loved, and the mother the children lived had passed away. At first, the children dislikes Maria. But later, with various events, Maria becomes the light in the Von Trapps family they once had lost. Von Trapp and Maria falls in love with eachother, but the war occuring in europe effects their country Austria. Von TRapp, once a captain of a ship, has been forced to serve in the Nazi's army. In the end, the Von Trapp's family escapes on foot through the mountains once Maria had loved and sang of. With the dramatic scene, the Beautifull movie ends with such happyness and love.Music : The most important part in this movie is the music! So, many famous songs were written for this movie like &quot;Do-re-me&quot; song, &quot;&quot;the sound of music&quot;, &quot;Eldewies&quot;, &quot;sixteen going on seventeen&quot;, &quot;My favorite things&quot;, etc. These classic songs makes the movie such a beautiful one. It starts with Maria singing in the mountains and end with the Von Trapps family walking on the same mountains with the music in the backgraound. I just love the music~! Not even a single song makes this movie boring. It makes it even lively~!Characters: Maria has a very jumping and tough image with such a soft heart inside which affects the once very loving Von Trapp. Von Trapp is very cold, but later becomes such a gentleman with a great voice to sing with. Each Child of the Von trapp's has their own character which makes little stories along with the movie. They are the connecter of the love of Maria's and Von trapp's.in a rating scale from 1 to 10, i say 11~! academy award winner. A lasting movie than &quot;Titanic&quot; for sure~!	5.0	such a Beautiful and Lasting movie~!	2000-12-05	3	0	3

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A25A0MJV5TXDR8	"A customer ""yourpalvince"""	Is this my favorite movie?  No.  Top ten?  No.  Top thousand?  Nope.  But I always enjoy watching it when I come across it.  Robert Wise was no slouch; this is expert family filmmaking, funny and uplifting and even suspenseful.  Sure, it's supposedly based on fact even while we know that no family with this many kids of this many ages could possibly get along this well.  And sure, you can't expect complex moral dilemmas in a movie that posits, &quot;Nuns, singing, and children are good; Nazis are bad.&quot;  But no one approaches this movie without knowing what he or she is in for, and therefore I'd be amazed to find anyone who was genuinely disappointed by it.  Let's just be thankful there were never any sequels or prequels.  One is enough.	5.0	If it works, don't knock it	2001-01-04	2	1	1
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	ADYNDO2PY0T3F	Adambadam	This movie is such an incredible work of art that I tend to compare it in importance to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony's -- with a big Ode to Joy.  Sorry to get political, though: the politics are important because it reminds us of where we are today.  At one point Christopher Plummer-- when he was informed that communications were no longer private under the Third Reich -- remarked that that wasn't his Austria. Yesterday, it was reported in the Washington Post and Fox that the NSA is developing encryption breaking tools that will likely result in zero privacy for all citizens and companies.  This isn't my United States.	5.0	Best film ever	2014-01-03	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2FI1YJ0OPSXDM	Adam	This wonderful movie, known by virtually all in America, is an inspirational movie.  Julie Andrews brilliantly acts as the star of this classic.  It shows that one's vocation is not always what they expect it to be.  Even though one may think they're called to the religious life, they may be trying to hide a problem or fear by living in the monastery or convent.  That's what the character in this movie did, but, after a conversation with Mother Superior, she went back to the Von Trapp house and fell in love with the head of the household.  They then got married, and she was grateful that Mother helped her to discern her real vocation.	5.0	Classic movie for people of all ages	2000-12-19	3	0	3

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AZXR5HB99P936	"A. Delaspozas ""Alicia"""	The Sound of Music is always going to be a classic. It is a very charming story and well done; it has some facts about the Trapp family, but of course some elements were made up for the movie, even so it is very nice to know how this young lady, Maria played very successfully by Julie Andrew gets involved with Captain Trapp&#8217; (played by Christopher Plumber) children and later fells in love with him.The music and choreography are outstanding, all the actors, even the smallest ones were very good singers.The quality of the DVD is perfect. I&#8217;ve got the bluray and the Alps scenes shown before s the movie starts look like they were filmed using 3D technique. Knowing that this movie was from 1965 and remastered to do this DVD is unbelievable for the results of this film.	5.0	A classic	2014-04-05	0	0	0

I thought it was about time to upgrade to the DVD since we now have a big screen digital TV.  We  were struck by the huge difference this DVD is from the poor quality of the video version...it's amazing!  The colors are vibrant and the sound has much improved as well.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3CSRP3P4U9HI	Alan R. Holyoak	Some people have described this movie as no more than melodramatic, sentimental sappiness.  Christopher Plummer is reported to have refered to this movie, in which he starred, as &quot;The Sound of Mucus.&quot;This movie is, in my opinion, the exact opposite.  The movie contains  inspiring music, a hopeful story line, and an engaging Julie Andrews as  Maria, the young governess to the Captain's seven children.  The chemistry  that develops during the film between the children and Maria and between  the Captain and Maria drives the story.Interesting supporting subplots  also abound.  Some include the Captain's impending marriage to a duchess,  teen romance of the oldest daughter with Rolph the delivery boy, the  scheming uncle Max who's always on the prowl for a way to come into fame  and easy money, the lives and times of the nuns in the convent, and the  pre-WWII Austrian setting with the threat of Nazi occupation.You will  find Maria to be creative, inventive, and made of sterner stuff than she  appears to have.  There is hesitancy, faith, fun, music, romance, drama and  suspence, and even comedy in this time honored Oscar-winning classic.If you have never watched this movie, watch it.  If you don't have it,  get it!  It's a great show for the entire family -- it does not have  offensive language, violence, etc., but it does have abundant positive  lessons about family and loyalty.5 stars all the way.Happy  viewing!Alan Holyoak	5.0	Excellent music and entertainment	2000-06-26	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AJWMVSLEVJ1UP	Alan W. Petrucelli	As much a merry musical as a riveting drama, The Sound of Music remains a classic that remains one of our favorite things. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are solidly terrific in Robert Wise's big-screen rerehasing of the (true) story of Austria's von Trapp family, who were forced to flee their Nazi-occupied country in 1938. Rodgers and Hammerstein's score (their last as a team) is magical and memorable, the way all great musical scores should be. Forty years after the flick was released, it's still a smart, strong film, and this anniversary edition is crammed with oodles of goodies, including an introduction by Andrews; a fireside reminiscence with Andrews and Plummer; sing-along lyrics; a reunion of all seven of the performers who played the von Trapp kiddies; behind-the-scenes featurettes and of favorites, the screen tests of Marni Nixon and Mia Farrow. Hope that under the tree, those brown paper packages tied up with string will hold this winner.	5.0	STILL A SOUND FILM!	2005-10-31	9	9	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AZ98OE0ECC1NF	Alexander P. Shafer	I got this as a gift for my mother on Mother's Day, and while the product itself was great. (She loved all of the various extras it came with - books, music box, music soundtrack, etc.) the actual blue velvet box it came in was badly damaged upon arrival. Since I had ordered this just over a month ago and didn't open it (since it was a gift for someone else), the return window had already closed, and Amazon will not let me exchange the item for an undamaged one. It's not amazon's fault that the box was damaged as their shipping box was in good condition, but the damaged interior product made for a lackluster presentation of a gift to my mom on Mother's Day. So just be careful when ordering this product. (Otherwise it's a great gift for anyone who is a fan of The Sound of Music.)	3.0	Good product, bad package	2012-05-13	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AABNRGHQUDQ85	"Allen Hall ""AllenH"""	We purchased this my wife's grandmother who loves Sound of Music.  She only recently got blu-ray and a large flat-screen, so I was dying to see how things looked all together (and force her to use it at least once while we were there). ;)  We put it in, and I was floored.  The image quality is fantastic.  In fact, it's almost too good at times- almost looks fake.  But- I think this was ultimately due to the settings she had on her flat-screen.  [Someone pumped it up to vivid settings with extra sharpness I believe.]  However, even with the settings not optimal (or rather as I'd prefer them), it was obvious that this release was the best in video quality out there.  Colors and textures were clean and clear- not muddy.  I remember watching it late-night on the old TV and it was horrible quality compared to this.  Almost like you're in the movie-theater watching it's release.  Fantastic!	5.0	Excellent quality image.	2012-01-16	2	1	1

That wasn't the case with this one.  Not only was the quality of the movie and sound fantastic, but I also loved the extras.  One of my favorites was the interview with the original actors who played the Von Trapp children - it was a lot of fun to see how they grew up.  It was also nice to see Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer together, although I think it would have been fantastic if they could have gotten them together with the children as well.  The documentary with Charmienne Carr was really adorable too.  This one is definitely worth the extra money for a second disc.	5.0	Great edition with great extras	2007-12-10	0	0	0

I remember seeing this when I was about twelve years old, easily pleased by the story then; I am even more impressed by the ability of this film to be meaningful when I am now nudjing retirement.  Julie is still winsome, the children are still able to come across as real.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1XLYHIZZJMOMN	American	Like most people in life - I became familiar with the songs from this movie first - without realizing where these songs came from -- !! This movie has been a favorite of mine since the early 90s -- based upon a true life account during the reign of the Third Reich in Nazi Germany -- this story will leave a lump in your throat -- you want to cry -- but cannot -- because of the sobering reality of what these folk and many others like them -- came through, during one of the darkest moments in world history !!!This movie alone blows a big hole -- in the holocaust-deniers theories -- no story like this could be made up from scratch -- when viewing this movie -- with the stunning Julie Andrews -- a slow realization of what people can do to (against) others in the name of patriotism to the flag -- is nothing beyond shocking !!! So tell me: just when does a nation's FLAG take precedence over the life of your fellow human-being ???? -- Loyalty to one's flag should ONLY remain intact -- to PROTECT your fellow citizen / countryman -- NEVER to use it to destroy them in the name of patriotism-- that's not only misguided thinking -- it's SICK --The music alone in this wonderful classic -- will keep you humming to yourself long after the movie ends -- it's a wonderful story of good winning over evil -- a story of redemption - buy the movie -- it'll do you good inside your soul.	5.0	So THIS is where all those great songs came from !!!	2013-11-25	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A14LAXM03WBX6E	"A. Munnik ""firewatcher"""	Some movie musicals have aged better than others. THE SOUND OF MUSIC is not one of these. The fault lies in the music; not so much the melodies composed by the great Richard Rodgers, but rather the unpoetic treacle served up by Oscar Hammerstein as lyrics. In fact, all the other film versions of Rodgers and Hammerstein productions (The King and I, South Pacific, Oklahoma!) have dated rather badly for the same reason. All huge blockbusters when they were released, they all seem to suffer from a surfeit of lyrical over sentimentality when viewed today.On the other hand, more modest musical productions have retained their freshness due in large part of their superior musical qualities. Before he teamed up with Hammerstein, Rodgers had forged a partnership with the infinitely more gifted Lorenz Hart. Their score of &quot;Showboat&quot;, or a potpourri of their compositions featured in &quot;Pal Joey&quot; illustrate how great music can elevate more modest productions. And let us not forget the contributions of such greats as Cole Porter and Irving Berlin, amongst others. Now those were fellows who could write witty and memorable lines as relevant today as when they were written.But those awful Hammerstein lyrics! Without a bottle of good Scotch I don't think I would have been able to see this thing through to the bitter end.This is not to say that THE SOUND OF MUSIC is without merit. The cinematography is breathtaking and Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer carry off their roles rather well. Robert Wise won the Oscar, but it is still quite a drop off in what he did for &quot;West Side Story&quot; four years earlier.In all great musicals it is the music that makes the film. In THE SOUND OF MUSIC it is the lack of musical quality that made me cringe every time the cast looked ready to break out in song.It is no accident that THE SOUND OF MUSIC marked the end of an era in movie making. The saccharine, artificial sentimentality of 1950ish pop music as exemplified by Hammerstein's phoney lyrics was falling rapidly out of favour, even before 1965, and for many avid movie go-ers, THE SOUND OF MUSIC winning Best Picture honours was a real embarrassment.	3.0	Needed several belts of Scotch to get through this one	2005-06-18	21	6	15

By now I have been to Salzburg and the surrounding countryside and so was able to recognize many of the locations.  I was also able to appreciate more some of the romantic subtleties lost on an 8-year-old (my age when the movie came out.)  To hear Julie Andrews singing at her peak is always divine.

It was one of our family traditions to watch it together, and we soon learned the songs by heart.  When storms would roll in, we would sing ""My Favorite Things"" together.  When we saw beautiful scenery while traveling, we would sing ""The Hills Are Alive..."", and when we said goodbye and felt silly, we would sing ""So Long, Farewell"" to one another.  Yes, the songs are great, and this musical as a whole is wonderful!  The Easter Bunny just delivered this DVD to our house last month, and I can't wait to sit down with my your family of three kids and share with them the joy that comes from watching this movie.

Later in life, I wrote to Maria von Trapp (while in the USN) and she sent me a most gracious reply.  Unfortunately, I was never able to shake her hand but I did see her at the premiere.

Still an exellent story - nostalgia from my secodary school years.Why can't all dvd's / blu-rays of this quality.  Quality DTS sound should be STANDARDIZED to ALL dvd's / blu-rays.

I saw it in the theatre, on VHS, and DVD, but cannot believe the beautiful details I'm now seeing at home!  I was actually reduced to tears of awe and joy during the &#34;Do Re Mi&#34; sequence - the picture, sound, editing, choreography, overall craftsmanship, and cast are so uniformly excellent!  The extras are all here in abundance.  This is what Blu-ray was meant for!	5.0	STUNNING BLU-RAY!	2013-12-28	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AIWGW684VBHKA	Andrew Griffiths	I was extremely young when I watched the screen version at our local cinema in Bristol, England all those years ago. Then it brought tears to my eyes just as it does now. What can I say that hasn't already been said in  these reviews. The acting, singing, tension, storyline, realness are  jawdropping. It just goes to prove how violence and money do not make the  best films. Why it is not on dvd is one of the biggest mysteries of my  life.	5.0	like red wine, it gets better and better	1999-12-29	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AAU8EDRZW5OIS	Andrew Schafer	This review is for the latest 40th Anniversary 2DVD edition, released on 15 Nov. 2005. While there are some improvements on the new DVD transfer, the film still doesn't look as it was meant to bee seen. First of all, the definition is lacking and the color overall is very pale, subdued and faded looking as well as quite inconsistant especially in an interior scenes. This film was shot in a 70MM process called TODD-AO, a larger format than a standard 35MM, that yields a very high fidelity image and rich color on screen. None of those qualities are found on this new anniversary DVD edition. The good thing is, the film is presented in a proper widescreen aspect ratio. No pan-and-scan crap that cut off almost 2/3 of the image, especially in a long shots (there are lots in this film) like those found in early, old VHS video editions. So you can see the full widescreen composition of this beautifully shot film. The bad thing is, too many miss & match materials were used for this transfer. Why don't 20th Century Fox Home Video uses the best source material for this anniversary transfer, I wonder. It seems they want to go for a cheap video production to gain as much profit as possible. The new Oklahoma! 50th anniversary looks extremely bad. I won't buy classics DVDs from Fox again, unless I rent them first and judge it from there.	2.0	Great film but very bad DVD transfer!	2005-11-16	17	11	6

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2I5MRK2HBO0JC	Angie	"I am now almost 60 years old, and I think my mom took my younger sisters and me to see this film at the theater perhaps a dozen times. Over the years, we have seen it on television and on VHS, so I jumped at the opportunity to get the 45th Anniversary Edition on Blu-Ray for such a low price when it was advertised on sale. When the package arrived, I was very surprised to find that the package was so heavy. Among other things, the package included a ceramic music box that I could add to my collection of music boxes. When my husband and I watched the Blu-Ray, I found I still knew the whole movie word for word, but that did not lessen my enjoyment. This time, I saw it on a big screen HDTV without commercials, and with closed captioning. I actually did get one or two words I had never understood before.The best thing for me, however, was that I was able to send another package to the home of my sister who is caring for my dying mom. We are trying to provide some of my mom's ""Favorite Things"" in her last days. I send flowers every few weeks, and last month I also sent her favorite gourmet ice cream topping. Now, as I wrote to my sister who has a doctorate in music and who is also caring for Mom, that I want her family to keep the package when Mom passes.Mom managed to pass on her love of music to all four of us girls - to some more than others, and that love of music has passed on down through the generations. Both of my kids now have pianos that have been passed on down from my parents, and all four of my grandchildren, ages 7 - 13, are continuing to fill their homes with ""The Sound of Music"" as they take lessons and practice. They connect with my mom, their ""Granny,"" on Skype or FaceTime and play their latest pieces for her when she is able to listen.If you have ever enjoyed this movie - and millions of you have - don't pass up this opportunity to have it at home and enjoy it whenever you wish along with the keepsake mementos that are included."	5.0	What a Great Price!	2013-09-08	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z	Annie Van Auken	"NOTE: This is NOT a DVD. It's a 12"" Laserdisc. These record album-sized predecessors of today's DVDs were visually superior. Until the advent of Blu-Ray technology, Laserdiscs were the best video format available..Rodgers & Hammerstein's THE SOUND OF MUSIC was performed on Broadway 1443 times between 11/16/59 and 6/15/1963. It garnered six Tonys including Best Musical, Actress (Mary Martin) and Featured Actress (Patricia Neway) and was nominated for four more. Robert Wise's 1965 film adaptation eliminates three songs but adds two. IMDb incorrectly reports that Portia Nelson appeared both on stage and in the movie. No original Broadway cast members are in the film.SYNOPSIS--Postulant Maria Rainer is having trouble adjusting to life in a nunnery so Mother Abbess sends her to the estate of Capt. Georg von Trapp where she is to be governess to his seven children. The captain has been embittered since his wife died. He runs his home like a ship and treats the children as its crew: giving them uniforms and whistle commands, strictly allowing no laughter, singing or gaiety.The youngsters fight back by annoying every governess Trapp hires into quitting. Their practical jokes don't work on Maria though. Her pleasant manner and a refusal to maintain unbending discipline soon wins them over. When the captain goes off to visit his baroness girlfriend, Maria uses the opportunity to encourage regular playtime and exploration of beautiful Salzburg. She also teaches her charges how to sing and harmonize.Their father comes home and sees his ""crew"" hanging joyously from trees and romping like the children they are. They all clumsily fall out of a rowboat, precipitating a loud fight between Trapp and Maria in which he orders her to leave. His anger quickly dissipates when the children sing for his guests, the Baroness and Max Detweiler. Their lovely harmonies melt Trapp's frozen heart and the visibly moved captain joins their song. He then asks Maria to stay. Max suggests entering the Trapp Family Singers in the prestigious Salzburg Festival and the captain refuses.At an elegant party hosted by Trapp, Maria realizes she's falling in love with him. She leaves for the convent but Mother Abbess sends her back to the children, who are brokenhearted and have come looking for her. Maria learns of Trapp's engagement to the baroness upon her arrival so she prepares to return to the convent for good....Songs in this classic musical are a delight, Austrian scenery more so, its story's always engaging, but best of all is the nuanced Oscar-nominated performance of Miss Andrews (she'd won the previous year forMARY POPPINS)..Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(7.9) The Sound of Music (1965) - Julie Andrews/Christopher Plummer/Eleanor Parker/Richard Haydn/Peggy Wood/Angela Cartwright (uncredited: Maria von Trapp)"	5.0	"""My heart wants to sing every song it hears"""	2012-11-06	1	1	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2ZZ048Y7WQFRF	Ann L.	It's a timeless classic for a reason. The oh so singable music by Rodgers & Hammerstein that has become part of my psyche. The irrepressible Maria and her effect over time on the severe but lonely Captain von Trapp. And the seven charming kids. I met Charmian Carr when she was about 50. She played Liesl. I'm sure she was a delightful girl just as she was in the movie. She certainly seemed a fine woman.	5.0	Who can't love The Sound of Music?	2013-04-12	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3LWC833HQIG7J	austin_Larry	First off. Think you have seen the Sound of Music? Well you haven't. I thought I had, many times. Of course it was always around Xmas with the commerical breaks. But that is a much edited version. There are small but significant cuts everywhere in that version. So this is a great thing to have. My 3 stars relates directly to the lack of extras on the one disc. The movie is 5+ stars, but the lack of extras warrants the 3 stars.So this is a must buy. Also the commentary is very good here. But given the price for this on Amazon, just buy the 2 set version. I got the one disc version at a very good price so it is not a bad buy. But for $6 more, why not enjoy the double DVD? This is a must get for any movie fan, and if you are not into the extras, by all means buy this one. This movie, like all of Rogers and Hammerstein's work is emotional without ever being fake or sentimental. It is full of sentiment and completely honest sentiment at that, but never sentimentality. It totally puts to SHAME almost every director and producer and writer working in Hollywood today. Complete and total shame and disgrace. Nothing coming out of Hollywood today can hold a candle to this. Entire director's careers with academy awards can't even begin to even compare to just this one movie. So get some version, especially if you have young ones. Sit them down, and let them experience what a real movie can be.	3.0	Incredible movie, must see, but don't buy the one disc	2004-07-07	22	17	5

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	ASDIF7S0U80CS	"BABU VARMA ""B.K. Varma"""	The Sound of Music (Two-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition)With nearly three hours of snow-capped Swiss mountains, a sprawling family of six children, extravagant parties, picnics and family concerts in Salzburg and buckets of encouragement from Rogers and Hammerstein, it's no wonder that this film is also called THE SOUND OF MONEY. It won FIVE ACADEMY AWARDS and has taken hundreds of millions dollars. It's the surprisingly simple story of Maria(JULIE ANDREWS), a nun who's Governess to the rigidly disciplined children of an Austrian Military Captain(CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER). She so enchants him that he breaks off his engagement to a socialite baroness. In the meantime, Maria, teaches the children to sing and the whole family is soon giving a concert in Salzburg, after which they flee the country to escape the Nazis.	5.0	THE SOUND OF MONEY	2008-11-15	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1CV9H42TDCFBF	Baby Blue	"I first saw The Sound of Music when I was a child, and I have been in love with it ever since! Maria, the sisters of the Convent and the Von Trapp family captured my heart with their melodious songs and their real life behaviour. This film is truly a classic and one that I still watch today and will probably continue watching with my grandchildren.The story appeals to people of all ages and the songs and the lyrics charm the children and parents alike, while the subtle messages to both parents and adolescents are present. Every teenage girl will feel like Liesl whose father doesnt want her to have a boyfriend at the age of sixteen. All the little children will feel like Gretel who wants to be noticed and treated as an adult even though she is only five. Fathers will relate to the Captain as they see how he struggles to show he cares to his children even though he is being eaten up by the loss of his wife and his fear of his children being spoilt. And which woman doesnt relate to Maria? We all know that at a point in our lives, we dont know what we are truly in this world to do, but the older ones always tell us that somehow, everything will work out fine.This is an educational, inspirational and entertaining movie that I believe will be around for many more years. The message here is that life is not as settled as people think. This story is based on the real life story of the Von Trapp family who ended up having to run away from Austria because of the Nazi's and Maria Von Trapp actually played a very big part in the directing of the movie. It is said that the director even found her to be too meddling at times as she wanted to movie to portray her family that she loved so much. The film was shot in Austria and a lot was done to recreate the time frame of the story and the reality of the characters. Julie Andrews and Chritopher Plummer are fabulous in their roles as Maria and Captain Von Trapp. The songs in the movie are popular to date. How many people have not heard someone singing ""The hills are alive, with the Sound of Music"" or ""My Favorite Things."" The latter was even redone by a British pop group and was a number 1 hit. I recommend it to all who have thought of seeing it! It is truly a joyful and memorable experience!"	5.0	The Best Movie Ever	2006-06-27	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2IAR5XDY0KT2F	Becky	Full of breathtaking scenery, catchy tunes, delightful romance, and set during the golden age of innocence prior to the darkest chapter in  humanity, &quot;The Sound Of Music&quot; has become one of the 20th  century's greatest cinematic treasures.A movie that becomes more  enjoyable with each repeated viewing, it centres around Maria, (a role  Julie Andrews was undoubtedly preordained for) a spirited apprentice nun  who is appointed governess to the 7 unruly Von Trapp children during one  summer vacation in late 1930's Austria.  After initial mishaps, Maria  succeeds in winning the affections of the children, the hearts of the  viewers, and ultimately the love of her employer, the autocratic Captain  Von Trapp, (played to dignified indefectibility by Christopher  Plummer).Released in 1965 to worldwide kudos, this movie was an instant  box office success and won multiple Oscars, including the coveted Best  Picture award.  Debuting during a decade of metamorphosis and turbulence,  it injected a dose of sweetness into a world which was losing its sparkle.  That it remains a bestseller nearly 4 decades later indicates that this  injection of sweetness was permanent.	5.0	It climbed every mountain!	2000-08-30	6	4	2

Something that I thought could never happen.Ever since we turned her onto &quot;Do-Re-Me&quot;, she had asked to watch this DVD every day. Now she knows all the words to &quot;Do-Re-Me&quot;, and she can sing it as well as other songs in the movie like &quot;So Long, Farewell&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;. Incredible.If you have young children who wants to watch and listen to the songs over and over again, make sure you get the DVD version, because you will be able to jump from song to song immediately, something you can't do with video tape.Highly recommended, especially over Elmo and Barney.	5.0	No age is too young for the Sound of Music	2002-09-06	5	5	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y	Ben Adam	"The Sound of Music is a movie that rightfully earned so many superlatives from the moment it premi&egrave;red in 1965 that almost as soon as it came out, people were also creating spoofs, making fun of the movie. Interestingly enough, Julie Andrews, together with Carol Burnett, created a spoof on The Sound of Music in a Carnegie Hall appearance long before she made the film, and she was as spectacular in that performance as she was in The Sound of Music. The film is now a classic, and it has been immortalized now on DVD.If I have one critique of the home version, it is that a film such as The Sound of Music was created for the wide screen and simply cannot be displayed in all its magnificence on a small screen. In the opening when the audience views the Austrian Alps and sees the spectacular scenery, those views are so breathtaking on the expanses of the big screen but look so miniscule on a television screen and jokingly small on a DVD screen or computer monitor, so my preference remains to see this film on a large screen with surround sound; it preserves the true magnificence of the film as I remember it originally. However, nothing can really ruin this film; even taken in microcosm, the film is still a masterpiece to behold.Julie Andrews is a natural in the character of the hapless postulate Maria who can never really fit in as a future nun and ends up becoming the governess at the von Trapp estate. Christopher Plummer assumes the role of Captain von Trapp very convincingly. It turns out that the two did not get along so well, and the love song ""Something Good"" had to be shot in silhouette to hide the fact that they were definitely not amorous with one another in the slightest, but the two play their parts with flair all the way to the end. Eleanor Parker as Baroness von Schrader is a perfect foil to Maria when she shows up for a visit and says, ""My dear, is there anything you can't do?"" Richard Hayden is charming as the amoral entrepreneur Max Detweiler who books the children into the festival and, ultimately, is responsible for enabling the family to escape from the Nazis. Peggy Wood as the Mother Abbess plays a very small part but gets to sing the immortal Climb Every Mountain that is, in many ways, the turning point for Maria in the film.The children, of course, get quite a bit of the attention as Maria came to care for them. The critics often commented that it was less than convincing that all the children seemed to get along so well without fighting, without having to go to the bathroom or having a runny nose -- well, somehow things like those DID seem to get left out, but in the span of the movie, just how much were they supposed to include and still get in the entire Rodgers and Hammerstein score? The score is such an impressive part of the movie, and the choreography with the children is so well staged -- don't forget that the children were growing during the film, so it was necessary to make adjustments for the changes in height -- that it's important to appreciate the film's many virtues. Note that in the song Do Re Mi, the song covers many different scenes and locations; a lot could have gone on in the interim!I always found the performance of Charmian Carr to be rather shallow, so it never surprised me that her career ended with this film; many people argued that an ingenue doesn't need to be able to act, but I always argued that she does if she wants to continue acting! Heather Menzies certainly did, as did Nicholas Hammond and Angela Cartwright; of course, Angela Cartwright was already well known to American audiences from television when she did the film.So much can be said about the film, but one thing I can say that says it all: you'll definitely enjoy it. It's probably the happiest film ever made, and you'll enjoy watching it throughout. If you are the sort of person who likes being happy and likes watching happy films, this is the film for you. Great music, beautiful scenery, and a happy story with a happy ending. How can you go wrong with that?"	5.0	Miraculous, Timeless Musical	2005-03-04	8	7	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1MR1VMK999I6O	"Beth DeRoos ""Beth DeRoos from the California ..."	I know this is a sappy movie to some people but I loved it the first time I saw it back in 1966, which is when I also met my husband who happened to be sitting next to me in the theatre. We chatted during intermission and I shared how we had friends who sang with the Von Trapp family and then after the movie we went for coffee and within forty eight hours we would be married.The movie appeals to me for a variety of reasons.  First the cinematography is stunning.  The musical elements by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein are wonderful and the core of the story is one that when I stop and think about the period (WW2) that it is set in, with a widower newly married with all those children and a pregnant wife, escaping on foot over rugged mountains out of Austria into Switzerland, boggles the mind.  How many 'average' Americans would handle such an undertaking with little complaint?  Most I fear would simply succumb to the tyrants rather than seek freedom as well as make the moral and ethical stance not to be a racist, anti-Semite, thug.Having attended a convent school, and having been adopted I also seemed to identify with Maria and her quandary. That I think is where those who love this movie often find themselves. Somewhere the movie connects with us, because we see ourselves in one of the characters.  And like it or not its nice to enjoy a movie where there isn't vulgar language and where a family is seen working together not against each other.  Yes, its sappy, but sappy isn't a negative to me, just as good manners, kindness and moral fortitude aren't negatives to me.	5.0	Serious lesson if you look beyond the sugar	2005-12-04	12	11	1

Not only is the transfer flawless and the sound and picture stunning, but the second disk  contains information about the Von Trapp family and the production itself  that help round out what is a wondrous motion picture experience. In short,  this might be the best DVD ever produced, and it is certainly the biggest  DVD bargain at the present time.I won't dwell on the movie, since most  everyone already knows how great it is. What sets this DVD apart is the  wealth of background information about the movie--the family, the  production, the crew, and the actors--contained on disk two. Even though I  have read about the Von Trapps, I had no idea what the whole story was  until watched disk two. It was astounding. And the background info from  many of the still-living actors was priceless.If you love &quot;The  Sound Of Music&quot; like I do, shame on you if you don't run to the  nearest retailer and get it.

Even though it's a long movie, almost 3 hours, I found it very entertaining. When Maria and Captain Von Trapp got married, I thought that was the end. But to my surprise the movie continued on with a darker note when the family escapes from the Nazis. So what started out as lighthearted and fantastical ended as scary and realistic.  Even though Christopher Plummer is a very handsome man and a fine actor, I found him to be a very dull singer, but other than that ""The Sound of Music"" is a great movie"	4.0	Wonderful To Watch And Listen  (4.5 Stars)	2007-03-20	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3J1FL0POBKS0F	Boots	I have watched this movie many times in various formats. However, none of them (VHS, DVD, online streaming company, etc.) can hold a candle to the quality of this Blue-ray/DVD combo. I'm only reviewing the quality of the Blue-ray, as that is what I bought the package for. It's a plus that it comes with a DVD for our systems that cannot play the Blue-ray.At first, I was very unsure. The opening scenes are a teensy bit fuzzy still, but then again, what can I really expect? They cannot make the clouds look as good as they can when they film today. However, the grass blades (during the opening scene with Maria on the hills) are amazing. The people are so crisp and clear. Trust me, I've gotten very close to my screen to be sure. I wanted to make sure that buying the Blue-ray was worth it (although it isn't much more expensive than simply buying a DVD). I had spent ages on here reading review after review. However, I still was not sure what to expect.I'm barely in the beginning of the movie, when Maria is sent off to the Von Trapp home, but it is still amazing quality. I do not expect this to change at all.I'm the type of person who will watch a movie over and over again. I recently purchased Frozen (in Blue-ray as well, which I will review later) and have watched it at least 3 times a day for the past few days. I know, I know, that's a lot. My husband hates it. But I loooooove watching my favorite movies over and over, and he loves me, so he deals with it.This movie is most certainly worth the $24+change that I paid for it. I am a bit bummed that the price went down about $5 and I only bought it on 16 March. Whatever. Julie Andrews is worth it.If you don't have a Blue-ray yet, I suggest you get one. I was a huge skeptic about the whole system. Why change when we already have a large library of DVDs? But, we have a PS3 and it plays Blue-rays, and lately, Blue-ray movies are not much more expensive than DVDS (and in some cases, less expensive). I'm so glad for that feature. It has opened us up to amazing quality movies.Now, neither my husband nor I want to buy anything but Blue-rays. DVDs are simply not up to snuff.I suspect I shall be watching this gem again and again. If they manage to make it better for the 50th anniversary next year, well, I'll have no problem buying that one (and perhaps gifting this one to some Sound-of-Music-deprived family member).	5.0	Worth the Money & Beautiful Quality (both picture & sound)	2014-04-01	0	0	0

I don't like my daughter watching TV (21 months old), but the music and the scenes in this movie are priceless, and she ends up singing along and dancing along with them...Where to start?!-The Blu-ray - If you love this movie, you must watch it in Blu-ray. I liked the movie as a child, but I watched it again when we bought this, and I was mesmerized and fell in love with it! My parents, my siblings, my daughter, and I were all in awe.-Awesome that it comes with a cd of the songs. I only wish it had the Eidelweiss song where the Captain and his oldest daughter sing it. But since my daughter loves the movie, playing the songs in the car lets her enjoy them - she's entertained instead of just having a -blah- time in the car.-I love the little music box that comes with it. Because we love the movie, having the music box makes it more nostalgic. It's not the best quality of a thing, but good enough. I don't know what the material is - not quite ceramic, not quite plastic. But it's pretty anyway.I got this Limited Edition for $20 !!!!!!! at an outside store, and I wish I bought 4 more to give as gifts because it's such a wonderful thing to have. But for $35 when I bought it as a present for someone else, it's still very much worth it!	5.0	One of MY FAVORITE THINGS!!!	2014-02-15	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A25UZ7MA72SMKM	Brent Butler	The Sound of Music may be the best pure musical ever put on film. The scenery is majestic, the acting is excellent, and the singing is magnificent. It is a film that cried out to be published on blu ray, and thankfully that has finally happened.If you don't know the story, I'm not sure how you've remained in the dark about it for this long. LOL The quality of the movie and all its elements are well known, so I'm going straight to the details of the blu ray:I am happy to report that this is a criterion blu ray release. We've never heard this music with the detail and strength produced by the sound track on this release. It is pure. Watch out for the whistles sequence, it might split your ears. LOLThe Sound of Music's picture at times shows a bit of grain from the original large format film print, but that does not detract from the film. You literally won't want to miss watching any scene. It reminds me of watching HD images for the first time all over again ... in other words, now that I'm used to HD, this seemed yet another step up in picture quality. It really is that much head and shoulders above most other blu ray presentations. The gold script credits at the beginning of the film look like they are in 3D. Individual blades of grass and the rough weave of Maria's jacket are displayed in full detail. Everything in the film looks like you could reach out and touch it ... run your fingers across the screen and feel the textures.In short, if you enjoy this film, have blu ray, but don't yet have this movie, get it now. You won't be disappointed.	5.0	Might be the best deal in blu ray	2011-03-07	3	2	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	"It's a little embarassing but I admit it. I absolutely loved this movie when it first came out in '65 when I was a lovestruck, impressionable thirteen year old. I had quite a crush on Julie Andrews back then. But as the old adage goes, ""The day eventually comes for childish things to be put away."" After watching this movie recently on DVD I think this might be one of ""those things.""Yes, the scenery is magnificent, the Bavarian/Austrian architecture superb, the music delightful (though overly sachrine) and seeing Julie Andrews so young and beautiful dancing across the Alps brings back wonderful memories and youthful fantasies. But that's good for about thirty minutes and then what? Maybe I've just become jaded as I've grown older, but I now find the blatant overacting and the excessive sentimentality difficult to watch. Whatever the case maybe 'The Sound Of Music' is best remembered as a pleasant memory of my youth and leave it at that.With that said, I still can't give it less than - 4 Stars - just for old-times sake and those lingering feelings for Julie Andrews. A great movie if you have young children, or if you're really nostalgic about this genre of film. Otherwise look for something more challenging."	4.0	"""So Long, Farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, Goodbye"""	2005-10-12	24	6	18

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1GB1Q193DNFGR	Bruce Lee Pullen	There's definitely not much that hasn't already been said about Robert Wise's haunting classic musical epic, &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot; With its unforgettable musical numbers, Julie Andrews (Mary Poppins) shining perfectly in the zenith of her virginal appeal, Christopher Plummer playing an engaging love interest, a fantastically optimistic and engaging Ernest Lehman (North By Northwest) screenplay that produced sympathetic character stereotypes (note the Von Trapp children roles), an inspirational rendition of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein songs, and knowledgeable direction by seasoned film maker Robert Wise (The Haunting, Sand Pebbles). The Sound of Music survives as one of the most beloved Hollywood musicals of the 20th century, but due to its many dated 60's characteristics, does the Sound of Music continue to deserve the immense attention and fanfare that it has received since its 1965 release?Looking previously at the film's long lasting legacy as the cinematic pinnacle of human decency and morality, the Sound of Music entertains countless new generations despite of it's lack of developed performances, adherence to predictable relationships, reliance on routine plot developments, spontaneous transitions into inane songs, and an overabundant sentimentality that oozes sometimes over excessively onto the screen.  However in spite of its obvious shortcomings, the Sound of Music is an overwhelmingly dazzling display of the musical at its most entertaining and inspirational. This film is a testament to the Hollywood's gift of providing magically poignant entertainment to masses.I for one detest the musical's trust in positive conclusions, silly choruses, and predictable romantic stories. Yet the Sound of Music remains an awesome remainder that greatness can still come out of the most unlikely of places.Sidenote: 20th Century Fox's Five Star Collector's edition of the Sound of Music is a bravura achievement in providing a magnificent anamorphic widescreen presentation, a fascinating Robert Wise commentary track coupled with the musical tracks of the classic songs without verbal dialogue, a commemorative documentary, the theatrical trailers, and much much more. A Must-Buy for any lover of musicals of sixties cinema.Interesting Facts: The Sound of Music won several Academy Awards in 1965 including: Best Picture, Best Director (Robert Wise), and Best Musical Score.	5.0	The Alps Are Alive With the Fervent Sounds of Musical Bliss	2000-10-03	3	3	0

Read the more detailed descriptions (below) because I want to point out how reading the product description COULD have avoided a handful of one-star reviews. One of those speed-reading morons presented a good example of NOT reading THE VERY LARGE PRINT before hitting the ""Add to Cart"" button. The Amazon description says: Disc 1 - Blu-ray. Disc 2 - Blu-ray. Disc 3 - DVD. How does a person infer, after reading the description, ""You would think (in) a 3-disk set in a DVD box labeled DVD + BluRay, (that) at least 2 of the disks would be DVD""? That same reviewer bought this edition even though the item's description was in a ""font was too small for me to read."" Then adjust your monitor so you can, fat head! Two keys: ""Ctrl"" and ""+"" and you're set. You're welcome. This same reviewer whimpered how DVD users ""lose"" when they buy this 3-Disc set. DVD users LOSE?

The detail is incredible-with no annoying edge enhancement. The DTS 7.1 soundtrack is also a major improvement over previous editions. Twentieth-Century Fox needs to be given much credit for the meticulous restoration of this film. It feels like I own a 70MM film print instead of a Blu-ray disc! Thank you, Fox, for a magnificent achievement in remastering a classic film.  This box set includes some great ""extras"".  The hardcover book is very informative, and has many pictures from the making of the film.  The copy of the original souviner program was a nice touch.  The set also includes some great picture postcards of the cast in Salzburg, Austria.  Finally, the music box was a welcome addition to this box set.  I am sure my wife will enjoy it.  It has a small storage area inside, and plays ""My Favorite Things"".  Again, Thanks much, Twentieth-Century Fox, for a job well done!  Keep it going on your other classic films."	5.0	SOUND OF MUSIC RESTORATION ON BLU-RAY DISC	2010-11-04	20	20	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3HTX1NOTTWERP	Busy Body	When you think of popular movies, &quot;The Sound Of Music&quot; is definitely going to be on many people's lists. Infact, it's probably the most famous movie of all time, with more than 1 billion people having seen it. The words of the movie title are so famous, and the whole story of the film is just part of cinema legend. When it was released in cinemas back in 1965 it captured the imaginations of all those who viewed it, and this fact still remains by people who view it for the first time today. The scenery of the film, along with the classics songs in it have made The Sound Of Music a legendary experience in cinematic history and an icon out of Julie Andrews.The plot of The Sound Of Music is simple and easy to follow. The film is set in Salzburg, Austria in the last Golden Years of the 1930's before World War II choked Europe. Maria (Julie Andrews) is training to be a nun, but her frequent faltering in obeying tasks causes Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) to re-think Maria's potential position in the Abbey. She sends Maria to Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) to act as a governess and govern his highly eccentric seven children. Since their mother passed away, the seven children have had a string of governesses look after them. All of which could not cope with the demanding task of managing the troublesome seven. Maria reluctantly agrees with Mother Abbess, and makes her way to the household. At first she finds it difficult identifying with the children and getting them to open up, but as time goes by they gradually succumb to Maria's charms and her adorable ways.Over time, Maria poses a problem for Georg's new love interest who plans to marry him for his money. She tries to drive Maria away by embarrassing her at a party, and she does, for a brief while. Maria returns to the Abbey with Mother Abbess, who inspires her to return, no matter what the consequences. The final outcome is one of courage, power, love and the restoration of faith. It's a heart-warming tale of family values that appeals to people of all ages. I loved this film the first time I saw it, and my Grandma loves it even more! Some people think it's corny, but they're the critics who don't like something that achieves success because it's good. It's also a rather camp film, which makes it so much more fun in my eyes.The most famous scene in the film is the opening sequence, where we are given a stunning view of the entire country. The rolling hills, the snow-covered mountain peaks, and the tranquil lakes. The camera moving in to Maria on the hill as she spreads her arms and sings &quot;The hills are alive, with the sound of music!&quot; is just superb. What an opening to a film. From here on, the scenery of the film just continues to expand and grow. The mansion is a beautiful place to live with its surrounding lake, and the city is a picturesque landscape that defines the time and culture.It is almost impossible to review The Sound Of Music without mentioning the music that makes it such a classic film. From the first song, &quot;The Hills Are Alive,&quot; you know this is going to be something spectacular. &quot;Maria,&quot; &quot;I Have Confidence,&quot; &quot;Sixteen Going On Seventeen,&quot; &quot;My Favourite Things,&quot; &quot;Do-Re-Mi,&quot; &quot;The Lonely Goatherd,&quot; &quot;So Long, Farewell,&quot; &quot;Climb Every Mountain,&quot; &quot;Something Good,&quot; and &quot;Edleweiss&quot; are all amazing compositions. It's musical music, and not really something I would usually like, but you just can't help but hum along. You know all the lyrics and have known them for years. They're forever etched into your memory, and you know they're never gonna leave!The Sound Of Music is an exceptional film that everyone should see. It's a film where nothing bad happens. You won't find any death or violence in this. It's a very stereotypical film, but one that everyone can relate to at the same time. I urge you to buy this DVD, because this is a film that you can watch again and again. It's a masterpiece and to buy it would be a very wise move indeed.	5.0	This Film Needs No Introduction!	2004-01-01	8	6	2
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	ABH4G7TVI6G2T	Byron Kolln	"This lovely new 40th Anniversary 2-disc edition of THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a real treat.  But, for those in a quandry about buying yet another DVD release of the film (following the ""Five Star"" 2-disc edition), I say, buy this version but keep the old one too, because it has some great extras that were not ported onto this new edition (more about that later).THE SOUND OF MUSIC is of course based on the long-running 1959 hit Broadway musical that originally starred Mary Martin.  The musical was inspired by a Geman film called ""Die Trapp Famile"", based on the book by Maria Augusta Trapp.  The story is as well-known as those hills that truly did come alive with the sound of music:  Maria (Julie Andrews) is a postulant nun at the Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg circa 1938.  The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) becomes well-aware that the spirited Maria is hardly suited to the cloistered life of a nun.  So Maria is assigned as governess to the seven children of an autocratic widower, Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer).  Like a breath of fresh mountain air, Maria transforms the children and eventually steals the Captain's heart away from a worldly Baroness (Eleanor Parker).  But the Nazi Anschluss is coming, and the family's safety is under threat...This new DVD contains a wealth of new bonus material including :""Audio Commentary"" - brand new commentary track with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, choreographer Dee Dee Wood and Charmian Carr amongst others.  The Robert Wise director commentary (from the ""5 Star"" release) is also included.""A Few of My Favourite Things"" - Julie Andrews hosts this generous-length documentary which features new interviews with key cast and production team members, some rare photos, footage from behind the scenes and more.""Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer: A Reminiscence"" - Julie and Chris sit down and share their memories from the film.""From Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion"" - This is something truly special.  This segment reunites all seven von Trapp children to share their own memories and talk about the film.  With Charmian Carr (Liesl), Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich), Heather Menzies (Louisa), Duane Chase (Kurt), Angela Cartwright (Brigitta), Debbie Turner (Marta) and Kym Karath (Gretl).""On Location with The Sound of Music"" - Charmian Carr takes us on a personally-guided tour of Salzburg, taking in the historical sites as well as the locations featured in the film.  This is a cute update on ""Salzburg Sights and Sounds"", which Carr made as a featurette during production of SOM in 1965 (and which can be found on the ""5 Star"" release).""When You Know the Notes to Sing: A Sing-Along Phenomenon"" - This takes a look behind the scenes during the 40th Anniversary ""Sing-Along a-Sound of Music"" screening held at the Hollywood Bowl with an audience of over 18,00 people.  The ""Sing Along"" version of the film has taken off all over the world, and this featurette gives you a definite flavour of one.""The von Trapp Family: Harmony and Discord"" - This is the fantastic `Biography' episode which takes an in-depth look at the real von Trapp clan.  We learn that the real Maria was a far more flawed and fallible human being than we ever saw in ""Sound of Music"", and also the shocking fact that infamous Himmler took over the von Trapp villa shortly after their exit from Salzburg.  Featuring interviews with several of the real von Trapp children.""Mia Farrow screen test"" - A fascinating look at the girl who might have played Liesl if Charmian Carr was never cast in the role.  Farrow sings a brief section of ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" in a blonde wig.  Lesley Ann Warren also auditioned for the role (she appeared in the title role of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella"" instead), but it might have been nice to have had Lesley's screen test also.  Oh well...""Restoration comparison"" - Compares a 1993 print of the film with the new 40th Anniversary restored print.There are also copious trailers and galleries to watch and explore.The ""Five Star"" double disc set also included the fabulous doco ""From Fact to Phenomenon"", and that is the main reason why I'll keep my old DVD alongside this new version.  I recommend that all fans purchase this new edition, if only for the reunion featurette.  For those who have yet to buy SOM in digital format, this release is a no-brainer."	5.0	fabulous new 40th Anniversary edition is one to treasure...	2005-12-01	20	19	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3N6GAJTEOF4MO	Caleb Williams	In the 1960's Julie Andrews played a part in two of the most definitive musicals of the 20th Century. Disney's Mary Poppins and Rodgers & Hammerstein's The Sound of Music, both gave someone a clean cut fun and heart warming experience that had many people humming the songs for decades. Out of the two I would say The Sound of Music is the better and has left me with a huge level of admiration for Dame Julie Andrews. She has an amazing singing voice, and a class and grace unmatched by any fellow actress.The film tells the story of a young clumsy nun named Maria who is considered a nuisance by most of her fellow sisters in the convent. One day she is sent out to the Von Trapp family as the house led by Captain Von Trapp is after a new governess to take care of his 7 children. The Von Trapp household is led like one of his old navy ships, where he commands his children with the blow of a whistle forcing them to march and work, but there is no play. Maria becomes determined to teach the captain and the children what it's like to have fun, and one time whilst he's away to Vienna she takes her chance to let the children have fun and teach them to sing. This leads to a heart warming story which allows the children to sing and represent their home country of Austria.In my personal view this film hasn't aged a bit, I haven't seen it for a few years and actually think the last time I watched this was when I was 10 years old (I'm 22 now). Watching it again today, unlike most films from my childhood, my opinion of this has not changed one bit, I still love it as much as I remember doing so all them years ago. The intro actually gave me chills as I began reminiscing of this film and how good it actually was.The music of course is the main focus of the film, it has some of possibly the most catchy and memorable songs that could have you embarrassingly singing along at the top of your voice. Health Warning: You could end up with a sore throat after trying to sing-a-long. The kids are amazing with their music pieces as the general harmony of them is shocking, even considering their age with the youngest being 5. Of course Dame Julie was on top form and served as the delightful support for the child choir.The setting of the film in 1930's Austria actually gives this film a beautiful look, which gives you the understanding just as to why the character of Maria is such a happy person. If I were certainly living in such a beautiful country I have no doubt I would be the same. The film was primarily shot on location with very little need for purpose built sets or cardboard backgrounds. Because of the beautiful environments if done right it will look even more spectacular on Blu-Ray.I don't think this classic is really for a new audience as most young viewers wouldn't really appreciate the light hearted attitude and general good feel of it all. It wouldn't fit in with todays standard of films, it doesn't have violence, it doesn't have crude language and it doesn't have a smidgen of nudity. It's a wholesome film for the entire family, it doesn't need parental guidance or anyone to explain the film. I would say that although it's unlikely to captivate any new or young audiences, it's a film that will certainly convey a good and hearty message of love and positivity.	5.0	The Most Inspiring Musical Of The 20th Century.	2008-08-31	2	2	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3SU4S7BLVO2VW	california_drmr@hotmail.com	Although this picture has had numerous home video releases over the years  from tape to laserdisc, this new DVD version is easily the best to date,  offering a crisp, clear, pristine wide screen transfer that looks like it  was filmed only hours ago, along with an excellent surround sound mix that  is far superior to any previous release, 70mm six track theatrical prints  included. The supplemental disc offers documentaries and enough extras to  satisfy any Sound of Music junkie.The feature disc offers an audio  commentary by director Robert Wise that is quite interesting and  informative, but repeats much of the same information included in the  documentary. Parts of it seem a bit rushed, perhaps because he doesn't  speak over any of the musical sequences, which are presented without vocals  to highlight the orchestral arrangements and allow one the opportunity to  sing along. Wise points out where songs that were deleted or moved would  have gone as compared to the original stage show, and one can see how such  changes made the film adaptation superior. He also explains the technical  aspects of shooting on location and how location shots were seamlessly  matched with footage shot back in L.A. on stages. There were also a couple  of scenes that were shot but later cut--it makes you wish they had included  these outtakes on the supplemental disc of extras. There are some gaps in  the commentary where only the movie plays--leaving you a bit hungry for  more interesting anecdotes from Mr. Wise, but after over 35 years I guess  his memory is as good as can be expected.The French audio track is  fun--How strange to hear the familiar songs in French--not an easy task to  translate a song like Do Re Mi which seems it wouldn't make sense in any  language other than English. They did an excellent dubbing job--the voices  are quite similar to the original actors' voices, and the woman dubbing for  Julie Andrews holds her own.The 35 minute audio spot by screenwriter  Ernest Lehman is extremely interesting, giving you a taste of what went on  behind the scenes in the development of the production, from William  Wyler's indifference to the film he agreed to direct despite hating the  Broadway show, and prospective director Gene Kelly kicking Mr. Lehman out  of his house and telling him to &quot;shove&quot; his screenplay.Actor  Dan Truhitte also provides an &quot;audio telegram&quot; detailing his  experience winning the part of Rolf and some personal anecdotes. But all we  hear is his voice--a still picture of his present-day self would have been  a nice touch.We also get some sound bytes of old radio interviews that  are typical PR fluff but still an interesting time capsule. The video of  theatrical trailers and TV spots is interesting but repetitive. They are  almost all the same, with only subtle changes. For those interested in the  location there is even a brief but detailed written history of Salzburg.All in all, this has to rate as one of the best and most complete DVDs  ever released (despite those missing outtakes!) Fox did a terrific job, and  should be commended for NOT offering the inferior pan and scan version of  the picture usually shown on TV. This is one of those wide screen  masterpieces that lose a lot when the original aspect ratio is altered. A  must for all film collectors and Sound of Music fanatics alike.	5.0	Sensational Sound of Music on DVD	2000-09-07	54	51	3
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2O6K23YDIP81M	"camden0022 ""Amazon Jungle King"""	"I have watched this movie fully at least 5 times so far in my short life (maybe up to 15 when I saw selected scenes). I can't think of any late 20th or early 21st century movies that even come close to beating the Sound of Music. Many of today's movies have too much crude humor, violence, and especially sex. Even some of today's PG movies are not very appropriate for children.I believe every child should be required to watch this movie and write an essay on it at least once before graduating from high school. There are so many life lessons that can be learned from this great musical such as the meaning of family and how music can bring people closer together. I would give the movie six stars if I could. The actors and actresses (and the whole crew) of the movie must have worked super hard back in 1965 to bring this brilliant masterpiece together! I was more than impressed by Julie Andrew's voice and I thought she was perfect for her role as 'Maria Von Trapp'. I still enjoy Julie Andrew's acting and watch movies that she stars in such as The Princess Diaries 1&2 and Mary Poppins. She has a great voice and is lucky to have played a central role in the most famous movie of all time. After all these years the movie is still a worldwide hit. I am guessing it will still be a classic in the year 2100 or at the dawn of the 22nd century.Anyway almost 45 years after the movie was made I definitely recommend everyone to see the movie at least once in their lifetime. It is the closest that you can come to experiencing ""Heaven on Earth"". I just wish that more stores would start carrying this movie on Blu-Ray, although the film is just as good watching it the prehistoric way which is on good old VCR! :)"	5.0	"""THE"" Best Movie Classic of all Time!"	2008-12-28	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2IKWMHSHKRLGG	Carlos A. Melendez	Who doesn't know the general plot of this movie? Well just in case: Maria is thinking of becoming a nun, yet Sister Superior isn't so sure about that and sends her off to become the governess to seven Von Trapp children. There she meets the very strict father and the not so angelic children. She quickly wins over the children and their father. While all this is going on the Nazis are slowly but surely taking over the country. By the second half of the movie they become a true family and decide to make a dareing escape from the Nazis.Now that pretty much wraps it up plot wise, yet there is so much more. The songs are very sugar coated but so what? They are there for a purpose: teaching children to not be afraid, coaching them on how to sing,etc. In most parts they are there for the pleasure of the young and the young at heart.I'll close with an example. I was driving with my wife and our girls in the car, and we were looking at about an hour trip to my mother's house so we popped The Sound of Music in the DVD and we were on our way. As I heard (I coudn't see the movie of course) the movie and we sang the songs on our journey, I looked back and every face was smiling. Now if you are looking for a movie like that you've come to the right place.	5.0	Pure Magic	2007-06-25	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1ZLMUDI7UG37Z	Cathy	If you love Sound of Music, you just love it. Although the movie deviates some from the real characters, it is a true story that happened to the Vonn Trapp family in Austria during WWII.  Love, family, music all brought together by a nun who is sent by the Convent to care for children of a widower. The nun Maria finds that God has more in store for her than being a nun.	5.0	Sound of Music	2013-10-08	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1EK4CA4QE2M36	"""cattykitt99"""	If I could give this 6 stars, I would.  Bear in mind, I'm an adult, pretty cynical, and a native New Yorker.  However, if there's one movie that can bring me to happy nostalgic tears, it's this one.  In minutes my cynicism is reduced to a grown adult bouncing around on the couch, singing along word for word.  It's the film that is most remniscent of my childhood, and I couldn't imagine growing up without it.  If you're a parent, or if you just want some happy, untainted idealism in your life, watch this movie.  It's still my favorite of all time.	5.0	My FAVORITE movie of ALL TIME!!	2002-01-24	2	2	0

Though I've seen the movie several times on TV, movies and DVD I was blown away when I saw the Blu-ray version.  There are things you just don't see unless you see the Blu-ray version of this musical.  For example, at the very beginning of the movie we can actually see and almost feel the mist moving through the mountains and valley, as well as, looking at blades of grass with a totally new experience. The beauty of the movie is even more vibrant in Blu-ray.  Do yourself a favor get yourself a copy of the 45th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD Combo.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1WH32ZDX6ZFBD	Chang-Hoon Shin	I always watch DVD movies through my laptop, enjoying better visual quality than on TV set. When this DVD was loaded and played on my laptop, I couldn't help suspecting that my eyes had something wrong. The video quality was so enhanced that the film looked so dfferent from what I've seen on TV.So much accustomed to the video qualities of the 1960's movies aired on TV, that I felt a little awkward and uncomfortable with its vivid full-fledged colours, but fortunately, my eyes adapted themselves quickly to its colours, as the film ran on.With a supplement disc, this DVD version is a &quot;must-have&quot;, if you are real fans of musical movies. To me, this DVD is the first one that is constantly inducing me to buy a DVD player and widescreen TV to enjoy the full benefits from DVD technologies.	5.0	A triumph of DVD technologies...	2001-06-24	0	0	0

Well everything was just as we saw it in the film, and the narrative section of the DVD explained some location changes that were necessary.

Adams"""	"After 183 Amazon.com reviews, these few thoughts well be repetitive and redundant, but here goes.For what seems like decades after this film was released in 1965, Des Moines Register columnist Donald Kaul had a great time making fun of it.  I wish I could recall his many quotable quotes.  But Kaul never had much impact on the popularilty and &quot;staying power&quot; of Robert Wise's magnificent production.I enjoyed every single feature of the DVD edition, especially the audio features, interviews, etc.  The two documentaries also are worthwhile.  A most appreciative feature of Disc One is the running commentary by producer Robert Wise.  His commentary follows the film, with the score filling blank spaces in his narration.  I have not had the time or patience to listen to his entire commentary, but it's fascinating to learn tidbits of &quot;how&quot; the film was produced.The packaged material indicates that Julie Andrews agreed to make this movie for ""a large amount"".  I trust she was compensated well above that figure.  Her screen presence/performance is critical to the film's success and &quot;staying power.&quot;While, according to Robert Wise and screenwriter Ernest Lehman, many changes were made to adapt the theatrical hit to film, it still remains a Rodgers and Hammerstein work-of-art.This release is another tribute to DVD technology.A &quot;must&quot; for those who appreciate the American musical theater, Julie Andrews and Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein."	5.0	Julie Andrews/Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein classic...	2001-03-17	0	0	0

I'm an Animist, and the songs of this play sing to my soul quite naturally and strongly. Ethically, this isn't just munch; it is a strong story about being a good person, and in fact about being good, mature, personally responsible, courageous instead of cowardly, decent people. This is one of the best stories I know of. I think it may be a bit of a stretch as far as describing the true lives of the people it adopts its story from, but I don't care. What matters totally is what this has to say, as far as the Sacredness of the Earth, and the ability to do the right thing, even if your life becomes in peril.

This is one.  The initial few scenes are a bit grainy, but I think it was due to the limitations of shooting from a portable camera from a helicopter in 1959.  I'll forgive the grain.  But once the scenes move to the amazing expanses of the Austrian countryside I was blown away.  The clarity is phenomenal.  Even sparkles on the water were vivid.  Plus, the sound is amazing as well.  Bravo on the Blu-Ray.Of note:  this set apparently did not generate as much interest initially so the price has dropped.  I picked it up in the gold box for $18.99.  I have noted the contents and whether they are worthy:4 disc collection: film on Blu-Ray with some features (including a sing along version!), another Blu-Ray of special features, the DVD film version, and a CD soundtrack.The music box plays ""My Favorite Things"" but it plays a bit fast.  It is small-ish, maybe 3"" x 2"" x 2"" or so.  But it has space for some rings or a locket or some other 'favorite thing'.  It says hand painted, but it looks like it was painted from a stencil.  It is a stoneware style, so that is nice.The two books are the great additions to the set.  They have a special feature book (soft cover) and then a production bio (hardcover).The last things are a certificate of authenticity and some post cards.The entire set comes in a stiff cardboard box with a cardboard sleeve around it.  You can remove the sleeve (which has a couple of small pictures showing the contents) and the inner box is clean and looks like the picture.All in all a great set for fans of the film.  For under $20 it is one of the best finds I stumbled across this holiday season.  Even at $30 it is worthy.  If you don't care for the extras, there is a Blu-Ray special edition that is basically the movie with the 3 discs (not including soundtrack):The Sound of Music (Three-Disc 45th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging).  I recommend the boxed set for fans or as a gift, but the other version is great for those who just want to enjoy the film.One of the truly remarkable films on Blu-Ray to this date.

There's nothing about my fairly new LG player that needs updating.  All my other Blu-Ray disks play perfectly with a beautiful picture on this unit.  But on the Sound of Music Blu-Ray, the menus and the movie itself were horrible, full of pixelation on a 1920x1080 screen with the picture looking over-exposed.  It was just like standard def resolution with extreme compression similar to a youtube video.

The casting, directing, choreography, editing, even the costumes and sets, are superb.  The scenery is breath-taking & the chemistry between the cast members is as captivating as the music.  The music - what can I say - It's Rodgers & Hammerstein.  Sure, not a film you would select for futuristic special effects but way ahead of its time when you consider how long ago it was made.  It was a big hit as a gift for my parents' 52nd anniversary.  I caught part of it one weekend on TV & was reminded of how much they liked it when the movie when first came out & how we always had the soundtrack on an a vinyl LP in the house growing up.  I invited them over for dinner & planted them on my double reclining love seat with the DVD as a surprise.  They enjoyed seeing the movie again & were totally sucked into the whole thing, even tho' the movie is almost 3 hrs long.  I had read the reviews beforehand but noticed no problem w/ the DVD quality, even on my 46"" flatscreen TV. The Bonus features are not as polished as contemporary ones, such as LOTR or Pirates that are filmed with that intent as the movie is being made, but still interesting enough to & add depth to the story & appreciation for the beautiful Austrian setting.  I have not seen or owned any of the other Sound of Music DVD sets, so I don't know how the bonus features compare.

First of, I love the film very much, and I have seen it both in the theatre and on video a million times. This DVD edition has wonderful special features on disc two which I enjoy watching immensely. But, I'm quite disappointed with the new video transfer on disc 1 of this edition. While it looks much better that the previous DVD edition released four years ago, it's not perfect. The color timing is quite wrong and they make everything looks so pastel and too blue. It looks like the whole film was shot at the exactly same time everyday, no sense of time or whatsoever. The original prints has a very atmospheric, warm and rich color balance. Where is that on this DVD. It's gone! The only good thing about it is a proper widescreen aspect ratio that allows you to enjoy the whole 70MM frame that the film originated, without panning and scanning that they did years back on VHS releases.	3.0	Great film but disappointing DVD transfer	2005-11-24	14	11	3
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1SUSQCOX16DAO	"Colin E. Schmit ""stagelaughter"""	I've often wondered what this show (both the stage and movie version) would have been like, had Oscar Hammerstein 2nd written the book, and not just the lyrics. Unfortunately, the movie gives us even less of what the Broadway version gave us - two of the best songs from the stage version, &quot;How Can Love Survive,&quot; and &quot;No Way To Stop It&quot; have been cut - albeit with a slightly less saccharine narrative (here penned by Ernest Lehman). The authors of the stage version, Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse, were attached to the project before R&amp;H, at the behest of the ultimate Broadway gamine, Mary Martin, and her (no pun intended) martinet/producer/manager/husband, Richard Halliday. Rodgers and Hammerstein came on board late in the game (after the lackluster debut of &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;) only to supply the score.This DVD provides us with a world of information - information that has Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews vehemently stating that the show, before Lehman's adaptation, had to lose a lot of the maudlin qualities [that people still complain about] the stage version had.It's nice to see most of the original cast, and director Robert Wise - and Lehman - chatting about the production. There is a lot of useful information here; not just about this particular movie, but about the [soon-to-be] end of the successful Hollywood musical. I give this DVD high marks for its extra-curricular content, but not for the movie. Call me what you will, but I still say that this show would have been better if Hammerstein (the author of &quot;Show Boat,&quot; &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; &quot;Carousel,&quot; &quot;The King and I,&quot; and the co-author (with Joshua Logan) of &quot;South Pacific&quot;) had written the show instead of Lindsay &amp; Crouse. Still, &quot;Edelweiss,&quot; not only the last lyric written by Hammerstein, is one of their best songs - a simple but wonderful waltz by Rodgers (his trademark), and a simple but poetic lyric by Hammerstein.	3.0	The Sound of Lindsay &amp; Crouse	2002-01-13	5	1	4

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1LFN5TXQ0B1HB	Constantin	A classic that promised a pretty amazing experience. The DVD was as expected - the same great musical performance I remembered with the typical softening that MPEG2 compression does to movies. Some folk here also noted a number of other issues, that I'll leave to them - I'm just going after the obvious issues.I had high hopes for the Bluray version and was disappointed. This movie was allegedly shot on 70mm film, the largest and most expensive format available back then, and with plenty of resolution. I sincerely doubt that the folk doing the filming would have allowed as many scenes as there are in this movie to appear out of focus and devoid of detail as they are on the bluray transfer. It could also be a function of excessive compression being applied... who knows. The bottom line is that this version of the movie does not offer the resolution to make bluray the big step up that I expected.Perhaps the originals weren't in that great a shape anymore but in many scenes the detail I was hoping for simply wasn't there. That said, the bluray movie still looked a lot more like an film-based movie (with pulsing grain and all the other typical artifacts of movies shot on film) than the DVD.But as 70mm to bluray transfers go, this one wasn't great for me.	3.0	DVD as expected, Blueray a disappointment	2013-02-17	3	2	1

There are people in the Nonburg Abbey in Salzburg that do not like her so the Reverend Mother sends her to take care of the seven children of a Widower Captain Georg Von Trapp.When Maria gets to the house of the Von Trapp she and Georg do not get along. However soon Georg can tell that she and the children really care for eachother and he starts falling in love with her, and eventually she falls in love with him. Only there is one problem Georg's fience Else. Else however knows that Georg is in love with Maria, and when confronted with this news Maria leaves for the abbey.The children miss Maria and after a short period of time Maria comes back and she and Georg are married. Unfortunitly once they get back from their honeymoon they are confronted by the Nazis and that night after singing in the Salzburg film festival they excape Austria climbing into the Alps to America.While not the factual story of the Von Trapps-it is a very good movie with great songs that stay with you for a long time!	5.0	The Hills are alive	2006-09-15	0	0	0

The kids are all nice, attractive and well-behaved, something else you don't see much anymore on film.The film is nicely photographed, too, and I don't mean just the Austrian Alps. Was it perfect? No. I did think there were too many songs in here, some of them done twice. That's too much.  There were a few other things, but it's nit-picking. Overall, a film which lives up to its lofty reputation.	4.0	A Beloved, Very Likable Film	2009-05-28	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	Presumably if you are thinking of purchasing this 5-Star editition of the Sound of Music, you have a pretty good idea of the plot.  It is based on the true lives (but in an accelerated time frame) of an Austrian family that sang together as a folk-musical group.  Julie Andrews plays the governess who wins the hearts of the children and their widower father, while teaching them how to sing together.  As such, the excuse for spontaneously bursting into song is reasonably logical, and the tunes themselves are catchy and well-performed.The performances, from the unknown (at the time) child actors to the veterans Christopher Plummer (as the patriarch) and Eleanor Parker, are consistently great.  Robert Wise lends a sure hand in his direction, filming in and around Salzburg and the Austrian Alps, but without allowing the scenery to overpower the actors and dialogue.  The quality of the video is very good, and the sound is certainly better than on my old VHS copy.The DVD has a good deal of useful extras.  Most interesting is the discussion from Lehman (the screenwriter) on the search for a director.  He also discusses the differences between the stage version and the film version (rearrangement of songs and scenes).  There is a fairly long making-of feature that is very interesting, but could have been improved with more information on the real von Trapps, as opposed to focussing mainly on the making of the film.  Interviews with a number of the principles, from Andrews, Wise, and Plummer, through the costume designer and a few of the actors portraying the children make it a well-rounded and informative set of extras.  In a very nice touch, the length of all the extras is displayed on the menu, so you can arrange your viewing schedule easily.All-in-all, this is a fantastic DVD, with lots of extras and good quality transfer.  The movie itself is one of my all-time favourites (certainly my favourite film version of a Broadway musical), so I was very pleased to get this DVD edition.	5.0	A DVD of the quality this fantastic film deserves	2002-03-11	4	3	1
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"""The Sound of Music"" was a monster hit when it came out in 1965.  It was a wildly loved by millions.  Children then and children now take to it and love watching it again and again.  The songs are wonderful, instantly memorable, and people love to sing them.  Even today, if you were to start singing almost any of these tunes many people could easily join in.  At the time of its release it became the biggest box office winner of all time and even passed ""Gone With the Wind"".The story is adapted from the stage show which came from an autobiographical book of the real life story of Maria von Trapp.  The Trapp family that is very much intact, large, and a keeper of the memory.  However, if you hear the comments about this film from self-anointed sophisticates, they drip with condescension and even contempt.  You would think the film to be unimportant commercial drivel.  Certainly, commercial success is no credential of artistic achievement, but neither is it a disqualifier.So, what is it about this delightful and beautifully done musical that upsets so many people (even as it brings joy to many many more)?  My own view is that there was a change in what a portion of the culture wanted in their art.  They wanted things more ironic, detached, and darker.  This movie is none of that.  While there were still musicals made after the huge success of ""The Sound of Music"", it was definitely a turning point that led to a decline to the present all but extinction of the form (unless you can relate ""Moulin Rouge"" to this film).However, this film continues to bring happiness to its millions of fans and this is a good DVD of it (although I wish the print could be digitally remastered and the color more even).  The commentary by Richard Wise, the director, is very interesting and informative.  He tells us about the actors, the shooting of the film, the way the actors got along, and he even presents the songs in the film as just orchestra.  It is very interesting to hear what is actually going on underneath the voices.There is a lot more subtlety in the film than I ever saw as a kid.  Sure, there is that abolished emotion we used to call tenderness, but it does not deserve the accusation of treacle or saccharine that are used to simply dismiss it.Well done.  Enjoy it and forget the pain junkies who need to be flogged by their entertainments."	5.0	A fine musical with millions and millions of fans	2005-06-23	10	9	1
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2XQRNLVCXV1D6	crazy about movies	Although Sound of Music is a popular movie that claims to be based on the Von Trapp family, it is not the real story of what happened to the family. As a girl, I saw this movie when it came out and again in the 1970s when it was shown on TV. I read Maria Von Trapp's biography (which was used very loosely as the plot of Rogers & Hammerstein's production) and her follow-up book, written in the early 1970s, which continues the story about the family up till around the time of the release of the movie (of which Maria was disappointed in the portrayal of George, family and events). For those who love this movie, you really need to read these two books, as they will find that the real story is far more interesting than this typical Hollywood unhealthy sugar coated awful fairy tale. The only redeeming thing about the movie was the photography.	2.0	Sound of mucus	2014-01-30	2	0	2

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A77184QJM3PM	"C. Tolley ""Chris Tolley"""	I've always loved this film. I remember watching it at Christmas time every year since I was a little kid. You would think I would get sick of it. Far from it. The scenery, the settings, the charaters, but most of all the MUSIC. Watch this and you'll be humming certain songs for days. The casting here is spot-on. Julie Andrews will forevermore be remembered as Maria, the troublesome nun who attempts to be a nanny to seven children. Christopher Plummer is great as Captain VonTrapp, the aristocratic ex-navy captain, who rediscovers the importance of music and love in life. The children are wonderful. Each of them does just the right job with their roles, and of course they sing beautifully. The cinematography is beautiful here, as the background setting of Austria is so vividly captured on film. This film transferred beautifully to DVD, with wonderful clarity and sharpness, and the film has never sounded better. I've reviewed many classic films, and I've enjoyed them all, but this one has a special place in my heart. Get this for your collection, it's truly worth it.	5.0	My Favorite Things	2006-09-02	6	5	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2UEYNUWKVOYPU	"Daniel D. Vander Haar ""movie history survivor"""	"One of the all time great movies that was ever made was the 1965 musical, ""The Sound of Music."" It certainly is one of my favorite films, but it is also one of the best examples of how history gets hacked to pieces to make it more commercial. As a result, I don't think I can ever watch that movie in the same way again. The basic saying in Hollywood is that when you have to make a choice between the facts and the legend, always choose the legend. So how much do you know about the movie's main character Maria Von Trapp as fact--and not legend? You think you know the story. An inept nun gets sent to become a governess for a man with many children, and she ends up falling in love with him, and marrying him much to the adoring approval by the children. Together, they flee the Nazis and live happily ever after. End of story, right? Not even close. This is legend, the kind of stuff Hollywood likes to show. Here are the facts--what Hollywood likes to stay away from.""The Sound of Music"" MOVIE takes place in the late 1930s, but Maria was born in 1905, and was raised by some relatives in an athiestic/socialistic home. Her ""father"" told her the Bible was just full of fictional stories, but when Maria entered a church thinking she would hear some classical music, she heard instead a sermon on the Bible that so moved her she joined a monistary. This was in 1924. If the time frame provided in ""The Sound of Music"" movie was accurate, Maria would have been a novice nun from 1924 to around 1939. Surely, no one can be an inept nun for that long of a time.There was a decision to send Maria to the home of retired WWI submarine captain Georg von Trapp, but her position was not as governess to all the children, as the movie portrayed, but specifically to the captain's daughter who was bedridden with rheumatic fever. Maria never returned to the convent,  and married the Captain on November 26, 1927. She entered the Abby in 1924--not that long after WWI.Captain Von Trapp was born in 1880, and Maria married him in 1927. Now let us do the math. The Captain was 47 years of age at the time; Maria was just 22 years of age. This sounds like something you would read about in Hollywood, where some 70 year old actor marries a giirl barely out of high school and becomes a father for the first time.When Maria married Captain Von Trap in 1927, the Captain had just twenty years to live. Such was their age difference. He died in 1947 at age 67. Maria at the time of his death was 35. According to the movie, the kids adored Maria, but in reality their first impression was one of resentment, and with the age difference its easy to see why. Here we have a 47 year old man producing three children with a 22 year old woman  --maybe better described as a ""young girl."" People today might accuse him of being a cradle robber, but perhaps times were different. The kids wanted to hang on to their memories of their real mother--not substitute them for this young thing.But think in terms of making a film about this. Is it as romantic for a 47 year old man to be married to a 22 year old? And how would you film a sequal? Their love was central to the story, and who wants to make a sequal where the man dies about 7-8 years after they were married--by Sound of Music time?And you know how wealthy Captain Von Trapp was? In reality, he lost most of his money when the banks crashed in 1932. The kids had to go to work to help support the family.Then consider how Captain Von Trapp was portrayed in the film. He was stern and cold, while Maria was warm and loving. In reality, one of the children descrbes the situation as just the opposite. The Captain was warm and loving, while Maria was dominating and pushy--hardly the Julie Andrews type.OK. Just enjoy the movie. They don't make songs like these anymore."	5.0	The Sound of Music as fact and legend	2004-04-28	5	2	3

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A39LRCAB9G8F21	Daniel H. Hawkins	This film accomplished a rare feat when it was released in 1965, one duplicated by only two other movies.  It garnered the biggest box office gross in the history of movies at its time, and it took home the Oscar for Best Picture.  The only other two movies to accomplish this were &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; in 1939 and &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1997.I watched it for the first time last night, and when it was over I tried to figure out why it became such a huge hit.  It certainly wasn't for the plot.  What was the conflict, and who was the antagonist?  At the beginning, the conflict was between Maria and Captain Von Trapp, with the captain coming across as a tyrannical father.  But he soon softened up with very little effort on the part of Maria and the children.  Then there was the competition between the Baronness and Maria for the Captain's affections.  Maria left and came back, but the Baronness left much too easily when the Captain told her it was over.  Both of these conflicts were pretty weak in my opinion, and their resoulutions were a big let-down.  The only real suspenseful part of the movie came in the last 30 minutes, and the Nazis were the only compelling villains.  So for a three hour film, the story is pretty weak.But the songs are absolutely wonderful.  The characters are colorful and well-played, especially the Captain by Christopher Plummer.  And the background of the Austrian mountains is breathtaking.  The film looks beautiful and sounds beautiful.  And you can watch it with your kids.  My 18-month-old even enjoyed watching the musical numbers.	4.0	Classic Musical	2001-02-16	0	0	0

The 1965 movie's incredible box office success inspired Fox and other studios to make big budget family themed musicals, most of which flopped miserably with audiences (just remember ""Doctor Dolittle"" with Rex Harrison, and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", to name a few).  ""The Sound of Music"" was Hollywood's last gasp at successful family themed musicals, before the genre was recreated with the grittier and more adult ""Cabaret"" in the 1970's.  After that, there was no going back to ""raindrops on roses"" and ""larks who learn to pray"", although attempts were made over the years.Even in its time, ""The Sound of Music"" was heavily criticized for its insipid musical numbers and dances as well as the sentimentality of the situations and dialogue.  After all, good and evil doesn't get any more clearly represented than by nuns and nazis!  Many critics at the time sadly longed for the heyday of creativity and craftmanship of the Astaire/Kelly/MGM partnership which had gone defunct in the 1950's.Nevertheless, ""Music"" was an enormous success, and is a marked improvement over it's Broadway source. Director Robert Wise opened up the operetta-like story with location photography, a reworked screenplay with rearrangement of key songs and the  elimination of others from the Broadway show.I saw this film as a 10 year-old at Radio City Music Hall on its 10 year anniversary.  Seeing and hearing Julie Andrews trill the opening song on the mountain and in widescreen was a moment I shall never forget."	4.0	1960's MUSICAL LITERALLY KILLED OFF THE FRANCHISE	2002-04-02	2	1	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A16FIL54R1RRM4	Darynthe	I think the sound of music is, if you excuse the term, a sign of contradiction. Just reading here a few pages of commentaries one can see how different people's reactions are to it, some people loathe it with a passion that is fascinating to me, I, who love it with delirium.Going over some reviews and comments from the sixties, you can find people who have seen the movie hundreds of times and their conclusion is that it's because it really helps their psyche in a similar way that a therapy would. Indeed, I'd say a 90% of the people who adore the Sound of Music don't find the words to express or understand the reason. But obviously, they keep on watching over and over because there is a positive essence that affects them in a nurturing way. The movie brings into spotlight purity and happiness as something totally possible and independent of personal circumstances. One can see in Maria, as Julie Andrews herself said, the person you'd like to be if things wouldn't be so rough in their own lives. Maybe that is why Julie's performance in the movie is timeless and fresh: so sincere and real, she really *wanted* to be Maria.As a big fan of the movie, I've found myself seriously reflecting upon one question. Does it deserve the place it has in my heart as the best movie ever? I am torn at the question, because I find myself comparing it to something so disparagingly as Citizen Kane, the movie that is heralded by most critics circles and serious polls as the greatest movie ever. Yes, Citizen Kane is perfect and genius from a technical point of view. Cinematography and photography are flawless. But it's a shallow classic even if it's perfect. As Ebert said in his comments to the movie, the appeal of the story is to the interest of people in gossiping and intruding in the lives of the famous. So the heart of the best movie of all times is this? This is what is represented by the Number one movie humankind has produced? Deep question indeed. Maybe I take it too seriously, but truth is I really love arts and I think they should be taken seriously cause they are some of the few things that will survive long after we all are gone.Now, although it's a completely different genre, the Sound of Music is Art. It's the movie that contains the most perfect balance of beauty I have ever found in any other film. The beauty of the soul of Maria, the positive ethics the story has, the joy that is underneath has nothing of sugary as many shallowly purport, but instead it's a soundless song by itself. The lovely and simple score with it's unforgettable songs is just natural because so much energy and youth as it is transmitted by the movie cannot be contained and bursts out naturally. The scenery of Austria gives the beauty a character and truthfulness. It's like a master painting that transmits and communicates directly even with the less sophisticated of the spectators and manage to make a direct bridge with their heart.The script is what keeps it all together, while it's not complex it is not superficial, it has humor, irony, and fast paced wit.It all put together seamlessly makes up for, what for me personally, is the greatest movie of all time. If indeed in one thousand years nothing is left of humankind, maybe The Sound of Music would by itself be a testimony of what is the best of the human spirit. That is love, beauty and art.This is something I am very thankful for.	5.0	A life changing movie	2006-05-05	6	4	2
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2NXLMNPSZ6P0	Dave	I don't have enough superlatives in my vocabulary to review this movie adequately (and the Blu-Ray version of it).  I'd rate it at six or seven stars if I could.The cinematography in this movie was incredible.I was overseas in the Army when the movie was released - I had only seen it in the 4:3 format later on.  So watching this version was the first time I had seen the widescreen presentation.  Combined with the amazing restoration, it was like a movie I had never seen before.This version has made me appreciate my Blu-Ray player even more.	5.0	Five stars aren't enough!	2011-07-31	1	1	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3OSR92LFD75EG	Dave Keiser	Of course this is one of the best movies of all time.  This is a musical that makes sense, 'cause music is so much a part of the story.The DVD version of the movie is great.  I especially like getting the featurette about making the movie and the short feature about Salzburg that came with it. (Plus there are other extras).  It was really interesting hearing about making the movie and about the actual Von Trappe family, which the movie is based on.	5.0	A Great DVD Package!	2000-12-06	3	2	1
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AHIK7BUXFRMT8	David Bower	"This musical is a total joy to watch; I would not even try to count the number of times I've seen it but it always remains beautiful and lovely to watch and hear. This particular version is well planned and presented and seems to nicely capture the special nature of the 45th Anniversary of this fine work.It will need a special place on your shelf as it is not intended to simply fit in with all of your other discs; it is, however, worthy of the honor as it is beautifully executed and includes all of the special extras that come with the Blu-ray disc that make it truly a collectors choice.First of all, the quality of the Blu-ray disc itself is excellent; the video and the audio both are as close to perfect as I could imagine. There is absolutely nothing there that gets in between the viewer and the performance; Salzburg has never looked lovelier nor has Julie Andrews. In addition to the feature film there is a second Blu-ray disc devoted to additional special features. The fact that they are presented in Blu-ray is somewhat unusual as this kind of disc is often in a DVD format. There is a full version including special features in the DVD format on the third disc and a fourth disc which is a stereo CD of the soundtrack.There is a protective sleeve which shows the box to be part of a Limited Edition and gives the number assigned to your particular set. The inside box slips out of the sleeve and has a hinged top which opens upward to reveal a ""Letter of Authenticity"" from Twentieth Century Fox. On top is a large hardback book in full color called ""A Few of our Favorite Things"" which first tells the real story of the Von Trapp family in a section called ""The Von Trapp Family: Separating Fact from Fiction."" It has many photographs of the real family and tells the actual story of their lives and adventures. One quickly discovers that considerable ""artistic license"" was taken as the script was written for the movie.The second section of the book is called ""The origins of The Sound of Music"" and describes the steps that eventually led to the movie version. It is the longest part of the book and covers the original book written in 1949 by Maria von Trapp, ""The Story of the Trapp Family Singers,"" it's progression to Broadway and its final progression to the screen. It is filled with interesting insights about the people and the process that made it all possible.Section 3 of the book is called ""Salzburg: The City of Music"" and along with some lovely pictures gives more information about the city, its history, and the locations where the movie was shot. The final short section of the book is called ""The Legacy of The Sound of Music"" and tells the story of the movie after its original release. All told, the book is a treasure and a worthy addition to the set; it will not be available for individual sale according to the inside back cover.Under the discs are two items, a reprint of the 1965 booklet which was available for sale at the 1965 rerelease of the movie, and a set of color photos of scenes from Salzburg. In addition there is a small hand painted music box which plays ""My Favorite Things;"" the box is curiously heavy and has a feel of quality.The bottom line on all of this is one has here a remarkable collector's item for any who appreciates this memorable musical; the excellent video and audio, the book, music box, photos and the booklet all combine to create a very special opportunity to enjoy again the wonders of this production."	5.0	A Timeless Treasure Beautifully Performed and Packaged	2012-02-17	10	10	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2YFQCTZEG2HQV	David C. Roller	"Mini Review of one of my top 10 favorite films of all time.My wife recently advised me that she had not been aware that ""The Sound of Music"" was a successful Broadway musical prior to it's film version.  What was especially startling about that admission was she had seen it performed on the London stage in the early 1990's. She just figured that the producers had adapted it for the stage rather than vice versa.I believe my wife's mistake is ultimately a tribute to one of the movie's enduring qualities: It takes a stage musical and doesn't make it look staged.  The pictorial majesty of the Austrian Alps that opens the film certainly lends itself to that effect.The Sound of music is excellent family entertainment.  It has romance, comedy, and International intrigue, lavish musical numbers, cute kids and excellent chemistry between the two leads. Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews give the finest performances of their careers and play off each other extremely well. The part the children play in the movie is well balanced.  The story does not get bogged down in their antics nor does it diminish their importance.Unlike many Broadway musicals adapted for the screen, the sound of music is not too long.  Weighing in at almost 3 hours it is long, but it does not feel long.  No scene seems redundant or any way unnecessary.  I think the fact that the film does not seem like a stage adaptation is one of the reasons why it does not drag.  The Do Re Mi sequence for instance, changes locations as the song continues showing Maria and the children gallivanting through Salzburg.  If the entire song took place in one setting it's length could grate on the viewer.The Sound of Music also has done an excellent job of hiding its age.  This is helped in part by the fact that the film takes place 25 years prior to it's filming, so in many senses it never felt modern or contemporary and as a result does not feel dated to the viewer.For these reasons and many more, The Sound of Music continues to be one of my favorite things to watch."	5.0	Film is 39 going on 40 and still one of my favorite things!	2005-01-16	4	4	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A19OORKBG1VUGU	"David ""DS"""	"Hollywoodized, of course.  This is a classic story.  I saw it on the big screen, and yes, when I was in Austria, I paid too much money for the ""Sound of Music"" tour, in Salzburg.  They used the back of one house, and the front of another house, for the Trapp house.  I saw the glass house where they sing ""I am 16"".  It was a pilgrimage, of a sort.  The tour guide mourned the loss of Jews, because they were really good businessmen, and he felt goods were overpriced.  I think it was genuine.  He also said that Maria was too happy to be in a nunnery of the time, and the nuns were trying to find a way to move this highborn woman off to where she wouldn't upset the nuns.  You can still see the nunnery, from a distance of course.  The first scene is shown 20 miles from the nunnery, so she must have had better hearing than a kit fox, to hear the bells there.  That part of Austria looks just like the movie, even the church where they got married is still there.  The story itself is well known.  This is of course telescoped, the real story is rather longer.  The Nazi sequence is a bit scary for young children, but the story touches hearts.  As long as movies are around, this one will be shown."	5.0	classic, best of breed	2012-06-27	1	1	0

By then, I hated it, and was glad to see it finally leave Cedar Rapids, and the Iowa Theater.Fast foreword to 2013:This has truly become one of my favorite things. I cannot get through the final scene without being reduced to a mass of quivering, sobbing jelly. It's a great way to clear clogged tear ducts as well.  However, if you don't tear up at the final scene of this movie, you must have a heart of stone.Yes, it's corny, and sugary sweet in spots enough to send you into a Diabetic Coma.But it's oh, so beautiful.Exactly what the doctor ordered for the 2013 Blues."	5.0	Guilty Pleasure	2013-08-08	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1BFTKKBHIR1BY	David G. Smith	I am afraid that describing the joys and disappointments of this film are a bit like solving a problem like Maria.Joyous, reverent and Broadway...Corny and saturated.  Definitely like holding a moonbeam in your hand.  First off,  I finally have figured out the appeal of Julie Andrews.  First off, she is a fabulous singer, and actor.  Her variety of performance between this and Mary Poppins in wonderfully broad in a subtle way.  But let me talk for a moment about her work in Do Re Mi.  If you read any of my reviews you will know that I tend to get swayed by small moments.  Well, Julie's commitment to the song and the performance of Do Re Mi is fabulous.  But especially amazing is the last section where she is running with the seven kids in a tunnel of vines.  Julie is running her hind end off.  This is no star performance.  This is a performer willing to give.  For this reason The Sound of Music works, and for the infectious first half, I would give five stars.The corn element works.  The kids have treacly, sappy choreography.  The boys are particularly musical theatrey.  But this stuff works...and is the musical.  The second half, the romantic, poltical half really seems to be devoid of charm.  Once the romance and politics is added it just gets fuzzy and focusless.  The wonderful score is almost devoid in the second half(except for Climb Every Mountain ) and relies on reprises, and an extremely weird reprise of Maria, sung in march time at her wedding.  But there is enough in the first section to really make this worthwhile.  Is this film a flibetty gibbit or a wave upon the sand?  Yes and more.  Check it out, and decided for yourself.  But see it just for watching Julie Run	4.0	a moonbeam in your hand	2000-09-23	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A11L5M4MJP00UW	"David L Hutchins ""Music Lover"""	"I am committing a sin here by reviewing a version that I haven't seen, but I wanted to make a comment or two about the movie itself for the one or two people who might never have seen it.  It's hard to find fault with this movie; it's wonderful family entertainment and the music is unforgettable.  That's part of the problem; the music has been played so much that you might be sick and tired of the songs.  The one I never tire of is ""Climb Every Mountain"".  The biggest problem with the movie is that it isn't very accurate.  We all know that Hollywood takes liberties with the truth, sometimes to make a movie more interesting than what the truth might be.  What I don't understand is why they do it when the truth itself is probably just as interesting or even more interesting.  A couple of notable examples; the names of all the children were changed in the movie.  Why not keep the original names?  Secondly, contrary to the movie where the father was so opposed to his children singing in public, he actually encouraged it because they needed to sing to help support the family that had gotten into dire financial circumstances.  The movie makes it seem like they were wealthy all the way through until leaving Austria.  It seems to me that the TRUE story would have been more interesting than this highly fictionalized account.  I hope they remake this one day with a little more attention to facts.  And following up with how they succeeded in America and what they did would be a wonderful sequel.  This movie has been shown so many times on television and I have seen so often that I am sick of it.  My wife loves the movie and can watch it anytime.  It is on at least once a year, so why buy a copy?  It's a movie that won't go away any time soon.  A classic love story based on true events.  Just be warned that it takes a lot of liberties with the facts.  I am surprised that the real Maria Von Trapp gave this movie such a favorable nod.  The then fresh-faced Julie Andrews was certainly more attractive than the somewhat homely real Maria."	4.0	Not Very Historically Accurate	2007-10-13	4	1	3

As other reviewers have mentioned, one can see every blade of grass; the details of the costumes; and scenery like never before. Also the extras such as photos of Saltzburg, Austria and the movie story book make this an even more attractive package. Viewing this movie is an uplifting experience and is highly recommended for the entire family.Note that I did have difficulty getting my older BD Player (Samsung BD-1590) to play the BD DVD movie. It would stop when trying to create the menu. I suspect that the problem was with loading the BD Live content portion of the menu, as there is an interactive mode that requires loading BD Live content. I found a workaround by removing the flash drive on which the BD Live content is stored before the movie is inserted; then re-inserting the flash drive after the move menu was displayed. Doing this I was able to access the interactive menu OK. I'm sure that the DVD is perfect and the source of this problem is with my BD player; however I mention it in case another purchaser may have an older BD DVD player that experiences this or a similar problem. I had previously ensured that I did have the latest firmware update loaded for my BD player (last updated in July 2012), however this update did not fix the problem.	5.0	Awesome Film Restoration!	2013-01-06	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"This beloved 1965 classic--one of the world's favorite things-- has all the elements of an Academy Award winner: Exquisite scenery, a compelling story, children, religion, romance, characters serving as comic relief,a memorable musical score, and one family's ultimate triumph over evil.Based on the true story of former Naval Captain Georg Von Trapp and his second wife, Maria Augusta Kutschera, the film greets us with a serene and panoramic view of the Austrian landscape on a lovely spring day.High on a green hilltop, momentarily escaping from her convent, is the bobbed haired, pinner-clad novice, Maria( the formidable Julie Andrews) initiating the Rodgers and Hammerstein score by singing the title song, which could not express the communion of music and escaping to nature to find  joy and solace more perfectly.As urgent as the call of the natural world feels to Maria, the urgent call of the  chapel bell soon  compels her return to the spiritual world of Nonnberg Abbey, where the are nuns gathering for Mass to which Maria will be quite characteristically late.Peggy Wood's Mother Abbess is a patient woman regarding Maria's shenanigans, but this is not the case with her assistant, Sister Berthe( Portia Nelson). Along with Sisters Margaretta, Sophia, and Bernice,( Anna Lee, Marni Nixon,and Evandne Baker),she ponders her dilemma regarding the renegade novice.For the Mother Abbess, the answer seems to be to send Maria out into the world as a governess to the seven children of a retired and widowered sea captain.Little does Maria realize she is being called to bring a somber household back to life.Reluctantly, she begins her journey, filled with trepidation. Slowly building herself up with her ""pep song"", ""I Have Confidence"", her feelings of assertiveness wane as she approaches the estate. Greeted rather coldly by the family's butler, Franz(Gil Stuart)upon her arrival, she wanders into the sealed-off ballroom, genuflecting and wondering how she should present herself to the nobleman who is her new boss.But the gruff captain( a cooly elegant Christopher Plummer) encounters her at the ballroom's entrance. Once they meet, their relationship is a bit antagonistic. But soon, the captain blows his whistle and six of Maria's new charges march downstairs clad in sailor suits to greet her. These include the eldest, 16-year-old Liesl(Charmain Carr), 14-year-old Frederich(Nicholas Hammond), 13-year-old Louisa(Heather Menzies),11-year-old Kurt(Duane Chase), 7-year-old Marta(Debbie Turner), and pug tressed,5-year-old Gretl(Kym Karath). Displaying the same penchant Maria has for tardiness, 10-year-old Brigitta(Angela Cartwright), distracted by another matter, arrives on the scene later.Maria withstands the pranks of the children to psyche them out at the dinnertable, from which Liesl excuses herself upon learning that her young swain Rolfe(Daniel Truhitte) is close at hand.The budding romance of the teenagers gives an enchanting moment as the two get caught in the rain.Housekeeper Frau Schmidt( Norma Varden) helps Maria settle in. Soon, despite Captain Von Trapp's rules about the strict observance of bedtime,  Maria finds herself consoling the youngsters by making them think of their favorite things during the thunderstorm,and proving her worth to the initially skeptical Liesl as well.The captain arrives to express his displeasure. But Maria has plans of her own.While enduring one of the Captain's many absences, Maria makes the children some play clothes from old bedroom drapes, takes them on outings, and teaches them to sing in multipart harmony as an alternative to playing pranks to get their father's attention.As the musical education of the Von Trapp children gets underway amid the fabulous urban and rural scenes of Salzburg, their father returns with a couple of very interesting and influential guests, namely, Baroness Ilsa Schroeder(Eleanor Parker), and a chaperoning concert promoter, Max Detweiler(Richard Haydn). As the three gather on the terrace, Rolfe, hoping to contact Liesl, and deliver another relevant message, proves to be a nuisance, hiding behind membership in the HitlerJugend when confronted by the captain.Soon the captain and his guests are greeted by the joyous band of Maria and the children as they fall from a boat and into the lake at the edge of the terrace.When reprimanded by the captain, Maria defends herself, and openly criticizes his inattentiveness to his children almost at the expense of her job.But the childrens' song for the Baroness and the Captain's joining them in song at the last moment breaks down a long-standing barrier between a grief-stricken man and his children. Maria is allowed to stay.The second half of the story finds the family in sunnier circumstances, expressing their love of music (as is typically Austrian) through a colorful puppet show, and by the childrens' urging their father to recite a song he hasn't sung in years, accompanied by Liesl.But Baroness Schroeder begins to see Maria as a rival for the Captain's affections, and her plotting to marry him begins in earnest. Convincing Georg to host a ball to introduce her to his friends, Ilsa acts as a gracious hostess, accompanied by Max and Georg.Georg's intercessions of Maria's teaching Kurt the Landler causes the Baroness to step up her scheming against Maria, and Max steps up his scheming to have the children in the Salzburg Music Festival after the children charm guests with their good-night song.A meeting between the two women results in Maria's sudden return to Nonnberg Abbey, leaving behind the heartbroken children, who may end up with an uncaring stepmother.There is evidence during Ilsa's unenthusiastic ball game with the children that Liesl suspects the truth.A visit to the Abbey, during which the children are turned away from seeing Maria sets the course of more favorable events in motion. The young novice soon has a glad reunion with her charges when ordered to return to the family. The Baroness concedes defeat, acknowledging her incompatability with Georg's family, clearing the way for a beautiful and stately wedding between the captain and Maria in what are truly the Last Golden Days of the Thirties.The couple return from their honeymoon amid the Anschluss, during which Herr Zeller(Ben Wright) once a guest in the Von Trapp Home, has been named the Gauleiter of Salzburg and shadowy events that were only peripheral during much of the story become central. Rolfe's relationship with Liesl changes.Georg is soon ordered to fill a postion in the German Navy, and in an act of true moral courage, this truly noble family leave their beloved Austria behind amid moments of poignancy and solidarity with fellow Austrians, the distress of pursuit by those who would compromise them, and the benediction of the Benedictine nuns(two of whom tip the balance in their favor). We leave them en route to a new life elsewhere in one of the most triumphant moments in cinematic history.The film takes liberties with some aspects of the story while remaining true to others. But in writing this tribute on the 45th anniversary of this film's release, it is considered opinion that the film's message of the triumph of virtue, and the soaring spirit of this enduring classic will continue through the ages."	5.0	The Triumph of Virtue	2010-03-02	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	"""The Sound of Music"", the 1965 20th Century Fox musical which would capture the world with its memorable music and it's touching storyline and continues to have thrived through various generations and will continue to thrive for many generations hereafter.The film is an adaptation of a popular Broadway play which is based on the memoir ""The Story of the Trapp Family Singers"" written by Maria von Trapp.  The von Trapp family are known for escaping from the Nazis in Austria after the Anschluss (the annexation and occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938).The original musical based on the book featured music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II (both Rodgers and Hammerstein were known for their music for ""Oklahoma!"", ""Carousel"", ""State Fair"", ""South Pacific"", ""The King and I"" to name a few) which led to the book by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse.  The Broadway production began in 1959 starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel and would later inspire a film adaptation in 1965 which was loosely based on the Broadway production and memoir.The film would become an ultimate success as director Robert Wise (known for ""West Side Story"" and ""The Haunting"") would win five Academy Awards for Best Director, William Reynolds for Best Film Editing, Irwin Kostal for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment, Best Picture and Best Sound.The film would be best known for its wonderful location of Salzburg, Austria (which has inspired an actual ""Sound of Music"" tour which has been functional for the last 30-years) but most of all, known for its music which include ""The Sound of Music"", ""Edelweiss"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"" and ""Do-Re-Mi"".The film which was budgeted at $8.2 million would go on to gross $163 million worldwide.  The film would break the record held by ""Gone with the Wind"" for box office revenue and would also be a film that would be in circulation in theaters for three straight years.""The Sound of Music"" would also continue to become a hit on video as it was released as a five star DVD release in 2000 to celebrate the film's 35th Anniversary, released in 2005 to celebrate the film's 40th Anniversary and now in 2010 on Blu-ray, a limited edition box set and a digital iTunes release to celebrate the film's 45th Anniversary.VIDEO:""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 2:20:1), AVC@22 MBPS.  This is where ""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"" literally looks amazing.  For those who have owned previous versions of the film on DVD, back in 2005, the film went through restoration using a backup negative of the original 70 mm print.  At the time, the original 70mm 6-Track print was so damaged, there was no way to even use the original negative at that time and most of us who watched the 40th Anniversary Edition felt that the film looked absolutely beautiful compared to it's earlier 2000 DVD release.With that being said, technology has changed within the last five years since the release of the 40th Anniversary.  The damaged original 70 mm print that couldn't be used in the restoration of the film in 2005 can now be used for the film with new hardware and software and is now receiving 8K digital scanning by 20th Century Fox for perfect restoration.No longer is the film hazy, no longer is the film more on the pinkish side.  ""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"" is vibrant.  The grass...you can see the various grains of grass, the strands in green, yellow and detail of the mountains over looking Salzburg.  I was amazed!  Another example, Maria splashing the water before she heads to the von Trapps, you can see the water droplets flying in the air, another one is the von Trapp's uncle and his coat, you can see the wool in his jacket.  There is so much detail in this latest version of ""The Sound of Music"", it's incredible!  I am literally speechless because I own previous versions of this film on video and never before have I seen this much clarity in the film ever!And I find it quite funny for each review I have done for the film, I mention of how the cinematography of William Reynolds was captured perfectly but watching it on Blu-ray, the cinematography... may it be the shots of Maria on the mountain, Maria with the kids on the mountain, the wedding ceremony, etc., I just feel that the cinematography as seen on the 45th Anniversary Edition via the new restoration really captures the beauty of ""The Sound of Music"" than ever before.  Absolutely breathtaking!Once again, the crew who restored this film...I give your crew a standing ovation...what you were able to accomplish with this film on Blu-ray is absolutely fantastic!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 4.0 Dolby Surround, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DTS.  Because the film was shot with a 6-track and because they were provided with the audio without the dialogue, for this 2010 edition, they were able to remove all noise but also making sure to utilize a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and as mentioned, I've owned several versions of this film and I even own the soundtrack to this film.The way this music was handled through the surround channels was amazing.  The music and the instruments playing on individual channels was well done.  The first thing that came to my mind during sequences of the sisters singing ""Maria"" to the wedding sequence, the sounds that were utilized through those channels were amazing.  Also, they were able to isolate the sound of Salzburg up the hills, the sound of wind, the birds... I was in awe with the lossless soundtrack.I absolutely love the soundtrack for this film and this is the best I have ever heard of it.  If you have a 7.1 setup (center speaker, two fronts, two surrounds, two rear surrounds and your subwoofer), you will definitely be impressed with how alive the music comes as it really sounds beautiful via the soundscape in the home.  Once again, I was in awe when I heard the music and I'm sure many people will be just as impressed by it.Similar to the video restoration, the audio restoration for this 45th anniversary is fantastic!  And the crew responsible for the audio restoration for this release should be proud because they did an outstanding job!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features from the 35th and 40th Anniversary DVD versions of the film but also newer special features that just literally packs this 45th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray release:DISC 1:* Your Favorite Things: An Interactive Celebration - A new way to watch ""The Sound of Music"".

Also, included is a slip-over cover case.JUDGMENT CALL:I literally grew up in a household where ""The Sound of Music"" played and to tell you the truth, when I was younger, I really couldn't stand the musical as my mother would sing the songs over and over again.  But as I got older and I began watching more classic films, I found myself watching ""The Sound of Music"" around 1990 or so and I ended up purchasing the soundtrack for the film on cassette.  When I visited my mother, I ended up playing the cassette and in a very long time, I heard her sing the songs once again.When I got married, I was amazed that my wife knew the lyrics also by heart and by the birth of our son, to help calm him, she would sing ""My Favorite Things"".  Needless to say, the music of ""The Sound of Music"" has been part of me during my childhood and I have no doubt that with my wife and son, it will continue on to the next generation.As for the film, I have watched and owned various incarnations of this film on video and I have purchased the five star edition of the movie on DVD in 2000 and I clearly felt that the 40th Anniversary 2005 release was just unprecedented.  I felt that it was the ultimate release and I figured, if it was on Blu-ray, it would be an HD version of the film and the same special features.  But I was wrong.  Twentieth Century Fox has given fans of the film the ultimate release with ""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"".Not only do we get another restoration of the film using the original 70 mm negative and now presented in 1080p High Definition, we get a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack which sounds incredible!  Just the fact that the film looks and sounds better is significant.  The colors just pop!  It's hard to describe of how awesome this film looks on Blu-ray compared to previous video releases.  In the past, there was always this dreamy, hazy look to the film.  Though it was colorful, I have always thought that was how the film was shot.  And the opening scene with Julie Andrews on top of the hill spinning around, I always thought that was a beautiful shot... that was until I saw this 45th Anniversary Edition and everything that I have thought about the look of the film has went out the window because this presentation is just amazing!  I felt the old colors always had a greenish/pinkish tinge but now, the colors look accurate.  Blue skies look vibrantly blue and no pinkish haze on the background.  Grass and hills are still green but now we can see the strands of grass quite clearly, more than ever before.The blues of Julie Andrews and Charmian Carr's eyes just captures your attention, the detail of Captain von Trapp's home or the clothing is detail that is much more cleaner and more evident than ever before.  Only one time in the film is where things do look a bit faux is when the Captain, the Baroness and Uncle Max are driving and of course, you see the usual fake background and that scene, you're not going to get much realism but for the most part, the film looks amazing.And as mentioned, the sound...I've listened to this soundtrack so many times but to hear it in 7.1 and hear of how the instruments were carefully selected for various channels, for those who have a 7.1 setup, you can't help but be happy of how nice this soundtrack comes in DTS-HD!  Again, awesome!And just when you think that was it, there are literally hours and hours of special features included in this release of ""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"".  It took me two days or so just to go through everything and watch everything and once again, I thought the 40th Anniversary Edition was significant, but this 45th Anniversary edition just blows it out of the water.  Various documentaries, commentary, various featuretttes, audio interviews and more!  And I can't even imagine what 20th Century Fox will do for the 50th Anniversary Edition but I do have one request and that would be to record the live sing-along for the film and give people a chance to select it as an optional soundtrack to watch the film and sing-along with those thousands of people (like the 18,000 or so that showed up to the Hollywood Bowl).  That would be awesome!And I need to go back to the restoration and to say that if Twentieth Century Fox now has the technology in 2010 to take damaged negatives and are able to repair it to the point where they can re-use the film for a master in a Blu-ray release, that literally makes me extremely giddy and happy because that means a lot of those wonderful classic films in their catalog can receive a wonderful Blu-ray release using this technology.  I'm very impressed with this release and I look forward to the potential of what this can mean for classic films on Blu-ray from Twentieth Century Fox.With that being said, for the very hardcore fans of ""The Sound of Music"", for this 45th Anniversary release, you also have the opportunity to get the Limited Collector's set packaged in a keepsake box and features a 100-page ""My Favorite Things"" scrapbook, a 45th Anniversary Soundtrack, a reproduction of the original 1965 souvenir program, an exclusive handpainted ""My Favorite Things"" music box and more.  And for those people who prefer all things digital, on November 2nd will also include a digital release on iTunes of ""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"" which includes a sing-along version of the movie and 180-minutes of behind-the-scenes material.Once again, I was shocked when I watched this release because I had no idea how much went into the restoration of the film for this 45th Anniversary edition because they just did one for the 40th Anniversary.  But the fact that they have the technology and that they were given a chance to do give this film a new restoration using the latest technology was impressive.  The addition of all this bonus material for the Blu-ray release is magnificent and the fact that this entire Blu-ray release of ""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"" just raises the bar of what a studio can accomplish for a classic film.Overall, this is a fantastic release of ""The Sound of Music"" and if you are a big fan, whether you get this version or the Limited Edition version, all I can say is that this is the definitive version to own that just stands out from its previous video releases in quality and quantity.  Great music, great story, musical performances, cinematography and just a wonderful family film.  Sure, it may be a bit too saccharine sweet for today's audience (or too long) but for those who have never watched this film ever, please give it a try.This is a perfect release in every category and easily deserving of five stars!  ""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"" is highly recommended!"	5.0	"Blu-ray: Magnificent!  The definitive release of ""Sound of Music"""	2010-11-05	598	568	30

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1HYGEDA3GUQX	Desiree Koh	Although the state of our culture these days has very little time and room for full-blown musicals, the fact that anyone's first introduction to this film genre is by way of 'The Sound Of Music' necessitates it as a fixture. And what's tehre not to like, as like holiday cheer, there's something for both adult and kids. As a kid, for example, you may enjoy the story as one of how the Von Trapp children learn to sing. As you grow up, you may begin to appreciate the romance and then finally, the Von Trapps' escape from the Nazis. The movie tackles and combines this multitude of plot angles so effectively that no stage version can hold a candle to its celluloid competitor.The songs stick in our minds because they're easily converted into ditties for kids, so we've all grown up singing them -- whether or not we've seen the movie. Very rarely is one familiar with all the songs from one show, and able to sing them with gusto!	5.0	Bloom and grow forever!	2003-01-25	1	0	1
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3PPSZB0W5DZH6	"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN"""	"40TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION** :  ""THE SOUND OF MUSIC""  DVD  goes all out and includes all new commentaries/documentaries. So if you previously purchased the 5 Star Edition and liked the Extra Stuff there that is not here; save Disc 2 from that edition, as I did, and also buy this edition, as I did.Late  AND GREAT director Robert Wise  (""WEST SIDE STORY"", ""I WANT TO LIVE!"") humorously and  admirably  admits he did not like the real Maria Von Trapp when she showed up  on the set during location shooting in Austria and Germany; describing her as bossy and wanting to direct the movie herself.Christopher Plummer and  Julie Andrews share a genuinely warm fire-side chat. The seven actors who portrayed the Trapp children are all reunited here as well.  Check out the featurette on the SING ALONG SOUND OF MUSIC sensation; and watch the documentary""HARMONY AND DISCORD""  which separates Trapp Family facts from the celluloid fairy tale. You may scream in horror if you watch Mia Farrow's screen test. As she massacres ""Sixteen Going On Seventeen"", you'll realize Mia couldn't even get cast as Liesl in a community theatre production. If Mia herself is watching or perhaps reading this (!)  , she is probably screaming, too.The discs also include two Audio Commentaries; one from soft-spoken Wise from the previous edition; and another  new one featuring commentaries from Maria's son Johannes (obviously the Trapp Family spokesperson);, Andrews, Plummer, etc.THE CLASSIC MOVIE** : Robert Wise and his Director of Photography Ted McCord transform Rodgers & Hammerstein final stage musical into a cinematic fairy tale that is often breathtaking. Wise, (who received the Academy Award as ""Best Director"" for ""WEST SIDE STORY"" in 1961 and  ""MUSIC"" in 1965)  for the most part, keeps the sticky-sweets elements in check. For decades, critics have unfairly dismissed ""Music"" as a naseauting surface blend of children, nuns, and Nazis. ""Music"",  actually , never pretends to be anything other than a musical fairy tale that is all about freedom and liberation on several levels.Ironically, pig-headed Warner Brothers Studio boss Jack Warner did not consider Julie Andrews ""movie material"" and refused to cast her in the film version of her stage triumph ""MY FAIR LADY.""  Andrews, making the most of the opportunities offered her,  quickly became a movie icon. The combined success of Walt Disney's ""MARY POPPINS"" and Wise's ""SOUND OF MUSIC""  left Andrews with a ""governess next door"" image she couldn't shake until 1982; when she starred in her husband Blake Edwards' warm and witty gender-bending gem ""VICTOR-VICTORIA""Julie Andrews holds ""MUSIC""  together with her enthusiastic, spirited performance as the  rebellious, out-spoken heroine Maria. By contrast, Christopher Plummer, as crabby, regimented Captain Von Trapp, tries to be as sarcastic as possible--  most likely, in a noble effort to ensure the film does not totally drown in sugar. Rodgers & Hammerstein's songs still sell the show; still retaining their sparkle and glow. And, critics be damned, ""THE SOUND OF MUSIC"" sits on the pop-culture landscape between Disney's ""SNOW WHITE & THE SEVEN DWARFS""and MGM'S ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"" as a collective, cultural experience that we hold in our hearts."	4.0	A BREATHTAKING CINEMATIC FAIRY TALE	2007-03-08	9	9	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1U00R7V760ULS	Diane Bosworth	SOUND OF MUSIC with a running time of 175 minutes in color, starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer.In 1965, the Sound of Music won Best Picture. For the star Julie Andrews and the cast, this film has solidified its place in history.The magnitude of this film to be undertaken back when cinematography was in its beginning phase and to overcome the obstacles of a foreign country. There were political issues that had to be addressed. The house that was depicted as Mr. von  Trapp's house was really an official building and had to be repainted the special yellow that is used to signify official buildings.On the issue of the family being brought back to life by Marie through the use of song and music is what I connected with immediately. For Maria to prove that things can change by going against the rules, takes her out of the role of an ordinary governess. Secondly, in my opinion, having the setting of the Austrian mountains as the set of the movie, just makes cry. Why is that so? Because, I participated in the tour of Sound of Music and seen the country side of Austria when I was stationed in Europe.I cannot be fair to this movie and not give it five stars for the depth of this film.	5.0	seeit	2002-10-16	3	3	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	As a child, when you watch movies, you tend to pay more attention to the wonderful colors, and more importantly, the things the actors do to make the audience laugh. As a child, most of a movie's dialogue goes unnoticed, but then you grow up and, watching those movies as an adult, they tend to lose a little of their luster.Which is what makes &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; such a glorious movie experience: the magnificent music and antics of the actors area delight for younger ages, while the moving and emotional true story of a woman who changes her life and the lives of those around her is one of the most empowering stories ever told. It makes smooth transitions from joyous to serious, boasts handsome performances from some very talented actors, and is helmed by a director who knows what the material requires and provides it amply.Based on a true story, Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical is given the big-screen treatment, beginning with the infamous opening sequence featuring the singing voice of actress Julie Andrews as she belts out the title song, set against beautiful Austrian vistas and scenic landscapes. While Maria (Andrews) sings of bluebirds and hills, the nuns residing at the convent are puzzled as to how to solve a problem like Maria. The solution seems simple: send her away to live in the von Trapp home, owned by Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), who is now a widower with seven children.At first, the children are up to their usual nanny-burdening antics, but one night, during a powerful thunderstorm, they warm to one another and quickly become friends. Even Captain von Trapp, who is put off by the unorthodox way in which Maria allows the children to frolic, begins to warm to her new way of handling them, as well as warming to her himself. Maria soon must come to terms with her mutual feelings for him, and that, coupled with the Nazi-Germany movement in Austria, may put the happy family in jeopardy.Let's face it: everyone knows every song from this movie, most of them by heart, all of them at least by name. The title song, &quot;The Hills Are Alive,&quot; fits the opener quite nicely, and, combined with such upbeat songs as &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; and &quot;Do Re Mi,&quot; the movie takes on a lighthearted and cheery feel that will no doubt keep children intrigued and maybe even singing along. Other songs, such as &quot;Climb Every Mountain,&quot; which closes the film, give the movie a serious feel for moments that require such a tone.The story is also very intriguing, even in its final third act. There is a nice progression throughout the movie of things going from good to bad, bad to worse, and then ending on a final note of majestic happiness. As with any musical, the songs match the tone, though none so beautifully as this movie.Julie Andrews will forever be remembered for her role as Maria, her lilting voice and caring nature carrying the movie along for many stretches of time. Her chemistry with actor Christopher Plummer, who plays Captain von Trapp, is magical. Plummer's character is well-rounded and stern, softened later by the newfound love in his life. The child actors are especially fun to watch, each of them portraying a different stage of life, from teenager to toddler.Director Robert Wise seemed an unlikely choice to direct &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; but after seeing it, I don't think anyone else could do a better job. The movie is as majestic as the mountains that surround the characters, and as moving and involving as any motion picture you'll ever see in your lifetime.	5.0	An all-time favorite!	2001-07-16	6	5	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2YQCWZ66PY16Q	"D. Mesirow ""Dolphin Songsmith"""	"This is one of the most popular films of the 1960's and one of the most beloved movie musicals of all time.  Originating on Broadway with a score and soundtrack by the famed songwriting partnership of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, the composer and lyricist created hit Broadway songs such as ""How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria,"" ""The Sound of Music,"" ""Sixteen Going On Seventeen,"" ""So Long, Farewell,"" ""Do-Re-Mi,"" ""Edelweiss,"" and ""My Favorite Things.""The accompanying story was one of the great musical plots, and therefore this well-balanced musical marks somewhat of a shift from musicals which focused less on plot and more on music to those which have a strong plot in addition to strong music.The musical received film treatment in 1965, with Julie Andrews tapped to play the part of Maria.  Mr. Georg Van Trapp is played by Christopher Plummer, who performs a delicate rendition of ""Edelweiss,"" a beautiful ballad about his Austrian homeland, which is in the process of being seized by the Nazis.  The onscreen chemistry between the Maria and Georg develops throughout the film, as political pressure builds around them, similar to the plot of the 1942 film ""Casablanca"".""The Sound Of Music"" takes place in WWII Austria while the country was on the verge of Nazi occupation.  The Van Trapp family, especially the strict father Georg Van Trapp, must wrestle with the upcoming political realities of living in a country at odds with the family's freedom-loving ideals.  The Nazi army wants Georg to join the Nazi occupation as a military officer, but Georg holds his ground and openly shows his contempt for the Nazis.As dramatic as it is playful, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of the essential musicals in Broadway and movie-musical history."	5.0	"One of My ""Favorite Things"""	2006-12-26	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A11C43I615R52G	"Don Vito Corleone ""The Joker"""	"Unlike most people, I don't have lovely memories from my childhood related to The Sound of Music. My childhood was not filled with live-action musicals (only Disney animated ones) and I just recently discovered true gems like Mary Poppins, Singin' in the Rain, My Fair Lady, The Wizard of Oz and of course this film. I saw The Sound of Music a couple of years ago and while I love the music it did not resonate as much as for example Poppins did. A friend lent his copy and after the first time, I like it but I was not overly impressed with it. Repeat viewing increased my love for the film and while its not perfect (which film is?)is so a joy to watch that now is one of my all-time favorite musicals. R&H; songs are one of the many highlights and after watching the film you can't help but sing the catchy wonderful songs from it. My personal favorites are ""The Sound of Music"", ""Maria"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""Do-Re-Mi"" and ""The Lonely Goatherd"". I just love the songs and the scenes in which they are played. Another highlight is the beautiful scenary of the entire film. From the beginning, your spirit is uplifted with wonderful shots of European mountains, the gorgeous city of Salzburg and more. It's pure joy!! Julie Andrews of course is the power that helps the film being as wonderful as it is. Just like in Mary Poppins, Andrews is perfect for the role and does it in a way that does not feel a stereotype. Maria is a full-fledged chararacter that we all can identify with.Add this an array of outstading supporting characters and you have a great film. Many have blamed the film of being too sugary but I think it perfectly balances all the elements and I think we have to thank that to the actors and director Robert Wise.As I said before, I had a borrowed copy of the film and just when I was about to buy the 40th anniversary edition DVD, I found out that Fox is releasing a new 45th edition and in Blu-Ray!! Of course that was the way to go.The Sound of Music comes to hi-def looking absolutely amazing. Fox must be and should be proud of the restoration efforts. The picture looks incredibly detailed and the colors are so vibrant that you can feel the rich European scenaries. All classic films should be restored this way because it looks absolutely fantastic. Likewise, the sound has a lavish new 7.1 DTS-HD sound that's completely gorgeous. You'll just experience the film like never before. Dialogue is cristal clear, the score is great and of course the songs are amazing. Impressive sound with impressive picture, What else can you ask?Well, if want more, Fox has designed a new ""interactive"" experience called ""Your favorite things"" where you can see the movie with PiP content, a karaoke track and a trivia quiz. Also you have the audio-commentaries form previous editions.In disc two, the bonus features are divided in ""Musical Stages"", ""A City of Song"", ""Vintage Programs"", ""Rare Treasures"" and ""Publicity"". The first two are completely new in HD and deal with the creation of the songs,R&H; partnership, the restoraton of the film, the real Von Trapp family, the Broadway Musical, The producton of the film and the locations that were used in it. The others are carried overs form previous editions but that is great becuase we have a lot of documentaries, trailers, reminiscences and much, much more. I tell you, you will need a lot of time to dive into all this material but everything is fun, informative and make you appreciate the importance of the film.Without a doubt, this can be easily called THE definitive edition of The Sound of Music.The Sound of Music is one of the best musicals in the world, and one of the most (if not the most) beloved one. It's certainly one of my favorite things. With impressive picture and sound, and a wealth of excellent bonus material, Fox has created a edition that does the film justice. If you like TSOM, there is no reason why you should not get this edition. Absolutely recommended!!"	5.0	How do you solve a Problem like Maria? Watching her in Glourious Hi Def!!	2010-11-22	4	4	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A29VKODW4R5U7W	dooby	"For some reason The Sound Of Music has never had any luck in home video release. It has never achieved the picture quality commensurate with its status. The 40th Anniversary Edition seemed like the opportunity for it to finally shine. Alas no. Yes it is a marked improvement over the previous DVD which image-wise was deplorable. But it is far below what we know is possible in film restoration today.What's good about the new SoM transfer? Well for starters they've removed the much criticised electronic edge enhancement which infuriated so many people in the previous DVD. This is artificial sharpening which looks good on small screens but produces halos around objects when seen on larger displays. The result is a slightly softer image but definitely an improvement over the old DVD. And they've made some effort at restoration. The picture looks visibly brighter. The color timing which was way off in the previous DVD has been partially corrected - but not totally. Skin tones which looked overly red previously, now appear closer to normal. However this color correction is haphazard. Some scenes have skin tones looking very natural, others still have that ruddy, sun-burnt look. The night scenes especially have skin tones taking on an ugly muddy-red appearance. In short, the color timing for the new DVD is inconsistent. Ironically, one drawback of the present color-correction is an overly-accurate representation of the original colors in some scenes - in the Edelweiss reprise at the Salzburg Folk Festival, Angela Cartwright's face (Brigitta) takes on a faint greenish-yellow hue under the stagelight. In the previous DVD this had been corrected to give everyone a uniform pink glow but not in the present DVD. It may be a truer reflection of stagelighting but it is not at all pretty to look at. So in terms of color-correction, in trying to please everyone, the technicians ended up pleasing no one. Black levels however are spot on. Level of detail is also fairly good, especially shadow detail in the darker scenes, definitely better than in the previous DVD but again below what we've come to expect of DVD transfers on the cusp of the Hi-Def era. This is especially so considering that SoM was shot, not on 35mm film like other movies, but on 70mm which should, if properly handled, enable us to see detail that would eclipse the very latest Hollywood productions, almost all of which are shot in 35mm today. Sadly it does not.Sound-wise, the THX Certified 4.1 Surround Sound of the previous DVD has been replaced by a 5.0 Surround. Note the loss of the .1 LFE (subwoofer). This won't make much difference as SoM does not make much use of the LFE channel but those using less expensive sound systems may end up losing the lower-most frequencies as the front speakers of these systems often cannot reproduce the lowest frequencies that will now be passed on to them. One also wonders why they did not use all 6 channels of the original Todd-AO soundtrack for this DVD. To find out in the Extras that they actually remixed the original 6 track audio into a new DTS soundtrack which we are not given here is only to add insult to injury. Apparently Fox is reserving the DTS soundtrack for its upcoming High-Definition version of SoM due out next year.The selling point of this 40th Anniversary Edition must be the Extras of which there are tonnes. What I appreciate most in the current set of Rodgers & Hammerstein Anniversary releases is the inclusion of a separate songs-only chapter list. I hope this becomes a feature for all future musicals. An interesting curiosity in this DVD is the ability to hear and sing along with the film in both French and Spanish with the appropriate lyrics appearing beneath much like in a karaoke-singalong. Although the French soundtrack was already present previously, this is the first time I've heard the songs sung in Spanish. There are hours of documentaries. I especially liked Charmian Carr's new documentary ""On Location with The Sound of Music,"" and the children's reunion, ""From Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion,"" where the now grown-up children reminisce about their time on the set and point out all the little bloopers they made onscreen. It's heartening to learn that they've all turned out very well indeed. Unfortunately with all the new Extras, some of the features from the previous DVD had to be dumped. By far the saddest loss was the exclusion of Charmian Carr's delightful 1967 documentary ""Salzburg Sight and Sound"".The Sound Of Music underwent a complete restoration in 2002 for its inclusion in the Academy Film Archive (A.M.P.A.S.). That 65mm restored print was first exhibited in early 2003. From the Film-to-Video restoration comparison included among the Extras, it would seem that this is the restoration used in the DVD. However it also shows how much more muted the colors on the film elements were even after restoration. It is only after the video transfer and color correction that the colors come to resemble what is seen here. The telecine color-timer was obviously over-enthusiastic with the color correction, pumping the colors up beyond what is natural.For those contemplating getting the 40th Anniversary Edition, do note that Fox has announced that The Sound Of Music will be re-released next year on its new Blu-Ray High-Definition DVD. That's where the new restoration will re-emerge, hopefully with a more accurate telecine transfer and the newly remixed DTS soundtrack. If you can, it may be wiser to wait for the next incarnation of this beloved classic and hope that Fox finally gets things right."	4.0	Fox slips up yet again...

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A37SFXAWN1CXO0	"Doug Danzeisen ""frankfan42"""	This is a genuine American classic movie regarding a musical Austrian family who eventually settled in America. Theirs is one of the glorious truly happy endings in moviedom. The DVD and Blu-ray were both included and knocked my socks off with the picture and sound quality. I have never seen the opening scene with the mountain lake water so clear, not even in the theater. Truly, the DVD is just slightly inferior to the Blu-ray, but the Blu-ray was just plain awesome and really showed off my monitor. Add in the glorious and visually dazzling story, with the classical outdoors beauty and romance, intrigue and yes, Nazis, closing in on the good guys.  This truly is a touchstone movie in so many ways and it is not an understatement to say that they not only don't make them like this anymore, but seldom did. Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and all the rest of the cast were really in top form. A must see for families- I have had this movie in Betamax ((what's a betamax), VHS, DVD and now in Blu Ray and the colors, shadings and cinematography are stunning and lifelike. Watch this movie and see if you don't find yourself humming some of the many hit songs from it in the next several days- Edelweiss, These are a few of my favorite things, I am sixteen, going on seventeen, and the glorious &#34;Sound of music.&#34; Uplifting and upbeat really resonate in a depressing and sad world. Yes, it was based on a true story, and the Von Trapps still own the ski lodge they opened in Vermont. The last big collaboration of Rogers and Hammerstein is a classic that will endure as long as we can watch movies. It is very difficult to imagine this movie being made today, the mid 1960s were a very different time. In all a glorious movie, that happens to be a truly happy true story.	5.0	Yes its wholesome, also uplifting and a joy to watch	2013-03-24	2	2	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	ADS5APY1NKTL4	"D. Pawl ""Dani"""	"For me, this film remains as one of the greatest musicals of all time.  It has warm, self deprecating humor, drama, and beautiful, beautiful music.It's hard to beat the opening scene with Maria (Julie Andrews), the young woman in training to become a nun. spinning with youthful exuberance, on a stunningly gorgeous green hill in Austria.  Then, the beautiful words, ""The hills are alive with the sound of music....""  For me, only Julie Andrews could capture the wit, the whimsy and the spirit of Maria.  Though, Mary Martin was wonderful in the staged production, Julie added her own touch of class, mischief and flamboyance to the role, along with that gorgeous, gorgeous soprano voice.This wonderful, delightful and poignant story of the young Maria, who has too much spirit to stay within the confines of the convent, is sent out into the world to be a governess for a widower and his seven children, remains timeless, irresistable and very entertaining.  Amazing to imagine that it is now forty years old!!! The young actors and actresses, cast as Baron Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) children, dance and act wonderfully.  Also, even though I have heard stories that Christopher Plummer refers to this musical as  THE SOUND OF MUCOUS, he managed to pull of his role as the gruff Baron, whose heart melts after coming to know the irresistable Maria, with class.  (Though, I swear , there are some scenes where I swear he is trying to keep from sneering, and doesn't always succeed!)This film is filled with some of the most well known tunes from musical theatre repertoire (""Edelweiss,"" ""Do Re Mi,"" ""Climb Every Mountain,"" and ""My Favorite Things,"" among others).  Also, the cinematography is gorgeous.  You feel like you are in the Alps with Maria and the children, and can almost smell the dew in the grass.  Perfect for the family, and essential for every film buff.  Even if you aren't a fan of musicals, I think almost everyone can find something to love about this movie."	5.0	in a class by itself.....	2005-02-05	7	7	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2TXR85WQLE32N	D. S. Thurlow	"""The Sound of Music"" is rightly a perpetual favorite among movie fans.  It took home five Academy Awards after its 1965 release, and continues to thrill audiences today with its superb musical performances, its touching story, and its fabulous location shooting in Austria.  This 40th anniversary two-disk edition offers a sharp, beautiful digitally remastered presentation, and loads of extras.The story is familiar to fans.  Once upon a time (in 1938), in the City of Salzberg deep in the Austrian Alps, a spirited young postulate named Maria is sent from her covent to be governess to the seven unruly children of a widowed and very strict Captain Von Trapp. Through pluck, compassion, and her ability to share her music, she captures the hearts of the children and enables them to re-capture the heart of their father.The movie has two climaxes.  The first comes when Maria and Captain Von Trapp must confront their unexpected feelings for each other.  The second comes when the Nazi take-over of Austria puts the Von Trapp family at risk.  In a thrilling conclusion, the family must dodge a Nazi dragnet and flee for their lives.The extras for this edition are quite remarkable, including the usual ""making of"" features that detail the lengthy backstory of the movie and the musical stage production that preceded it.  Co-stars Jule Andrews (Maria) and Christopher Plummer (Captain Von Trapp) provide delightful commentary.  Perhaps most interesting to this reviewer was the reunion of the actors who played the seven Von Trapp children.  They have some interesting stories about the long production of the movie in California and Austria.  Rehearsals and filming ran for months, during which the two boys grew several inches, two of the younger girls shed teeth, and all contributed to pranks and gaffs on and off set.""The Sound of Music"" is very highly recommended as superb family entertainment that has stood the test of time and is even better in this refurbished edition."	5.0	Climb Every Mountain...	2010-04-11	1	1	0

That despite the fact that it is sappy and a bit obvious, it's also witty, funny, touching, and endearing. You will want to BE Maria!Maria is a high-spirited young nun who is always late, always skipping and singing and sprinting around, and she's driving the solemner nuns up the wall. The Mother Superior knows that her place is not a convent, and so sends her for a time to be the governess to the Baron Von Trapp's seven kids.Baron Von Trapp (played to perfection by Christopher Plummer) is a widower, who has emotionally closed himself off, and treats his bouncy bunch of kids like military ship crew: They have to march, line up for inspection, and respond INSTANTLY, no matter where they are, to the blast of a whistle. Maria is shocked by this, and quickly tries to give the kids love and affection and FUN. The kids respond to this new treatment by becoming fiercely attached to Maria, despite their father's attachment to the beautiful, blond, completely uninteresting Baroness Schraeder.Naturally, that isn't all of the plot. There are love stories and stories about runaways, and the Nazis loom over all of it.The kids are amazing, from energetic teen Liesl to amazingly (but not cloyingly) cute Gretl. All of the kids are perfectly normal: Gretl announcing that she got her finger caught &quot;in Friedrich's teeth&quot;; Liesl's attraction to a young Nazi; Friedrich's musings on what grass tastes like. Liesl has been my favorite for a very long time.Plummer is excellent, he's alternately tender (with hardly a word said) and strict, loving and cold. But what shines through all the time is Von Trapp's moral sense, and determination not to help the Nazis. Julie Andrews is bright and effervescent, turning from a grown-up girl into a woman before our eyes.And the actress playing Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) is a very low-key note--you hate her whenever you see her, with her smooth manners and speech and appearance. Her talk with Maria made me gag. Then, in her last scene, she surprises everyone.This is a beautiful musical tale with roots in reality, a must-see for everyone.	5.0	A beautiful story that veers from fairy-tale to gritty	2000-08-30	1	1	0

Glad to have him on as his last bit of comments on such a great movie.When I hear Ms Andrews sing I feel terrible that her voice is not with us anymore. But she is still with us and hopefully she will continue to be given movie parts. The Sound of Music is one of her best performances in a musical and Duet for One is the best of her performances in a serious Drama.No family should be without the Sound of Music. It is great !!	5.0	Ms Andrews makes the movie	2005-09-24	4	4	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"It's downright sacrilegious to say anything critical of this 1965 musical classic, and I have to admit I still love the movie like almost everyone else I know. Between the postcard-perfect Austrian scenery captured by Ted D. McCord's vibrant cinematography and the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein score, it's an irresistible entertainment with Julie Andrews ideally realizing the role of Maria, the young Salzburg novitiate nun who may be too independent to become part of the order. She is assigned by the abbey's Mother Superior to become a governess for the seven mischievous children of retired Navy Captain Von Trapp. The rest of the plot focuses on the burgeoning love that develops not only between Maria and the Captain but also between the two principals and the children.A romantic triangle arises in the form of a Baroness who has her talons in the Captain until she realizes she cannot manipulate the inevitable, but the bigger conflict comes with the encroaching Nazi regime who attempts to strong-arm Von Trapp to serve in the Reich. A closer examination of the 174-minute movie really shows an odd imbalance to the narrative. The lighter first half is all told from Maria's perspective, and consequently, this is where most of the memorable songs are performed. After the intermission, Maria is pushed to the background when the Captain becomes engaged to the Baroness and then later when things heat up between him and the Nazi officials. Even though the story makes sense as presented, I've always thought this strange given the build-up of the story as Maria's personal odyssey.But no matter as the songs are beautifully staged and choreographed by Mark Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, in particular, the joyous Salzburg montage used for ""Do Re Mi"", the unintended slumber party for ""My Favorite Things"", the simplicity of the Captain's rendition of ""Edelweiss"", the gauzy gazebo duet ""Something Good"", the puppy love pas-de-deux in the same gazebo of ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" and of course, the how-can-it-be-topped opening title song. Besides the transcendent Andrews (is it a wonder why we all fell in love with her back then?), Christopher Plummer is far more dimensional as Von Trapp than I remember from my youth. Not only does he capture the sternness, but he brings a saucy sense of humor and fey quality to his performance. Looking regal the way Hollywood stars used to, Eleanor Parker plays the Baroness not so much as a vindictive man-handler but more as an insecure woman too comfortable with her exalted status in life.In stock roles, Richard Haydn provides comic relief as the cagey impresario Max, while as Rolfe, Daniel Truhitte transforms from smitten bike messenger to cold Nazi youth in record time. As the Mother Superior, Peggy Wood brings calming assurance, though her dubbed performance of ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"" is a tad too operatic for the movie's tone. The children are all well played, though I tend to think of Charmian Carr as a bit too Ann-Margret-kittenish as Liesl, especially as her singing voice does not sound remotely Tyrolean. Minor flaws aside, major credit should be given to director Robert Wise, who already performed similar chores on ""West Side Story"" and has somehow mastered the art of pacing such a marathon musical story. Wise's frequent collaborator, screenwriter Ernest Lehman, adapted the original stage book by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse with wit and heart and manages to tone down the innately saccharine tone of the story.The 2005 40th anniversary two-disc DVD package is obscenely full of extras which should satisfy the most persnickety aficionado. Still looking great at 70, Andrews provides brief introductions to both discs. First things first, the 2005 restoration effort and the transfer on the DVD have yielded a superb print, and it will not disappoint any fan of the movie. There are two commentary tracks, one done by Wise in a rather perfunctory fashion, the other a more anecdotal account by Andrews, Carr, Dee Dee Wood and the real Maria Von Trapp's youngest son Johannes. Then there is a very informative, 63-minute making-of documentary produced for the new DVD, ""My Favorite Things: Julie Andrews Remembers"" which thoroughly discusses the history of the Von Trapp family, the Broadway incarnation and the complicated transfer of the stage show to screen - even though a number of participants provide recollections, not just Andrews.There are also two charming looking-back interview sessions. The first is a 20-minute conversation between Andrews and an especially acerbic Plummer, who seems to be ridiculing the original Maria in the Broadway version, stage legend Mary Martin, for her reputed megalomania. The second is a 33-minute group discussion among the seven actors who portrayed the Von Trapp children, all looking decidedly middle-aged (their ages now ranging from 47 to 62) and showing a friendly compatibility with one another in their remembrances. There is also a 22-minute featurette showing Carr revisiting the Salzburg locations, providing a history of the city and even joining in on The Sound of Music bus tour (I've done that one, too).Another short focuses on the current phenomenon of the sing-along screenings of the movie, this one a massive event at the Hollywood Bowl complete with extravagantly costumed viewers. Also included are a fascinating A&E; Biography special of the real Von Trapps, a text-driven demonstration of the restoration process, and a real howler - scratchy screen test footage of an 18-year old Mia Farrow sounding particularly tone-deaf in her audition as Liesl (I only wish they had similar footage for others who auditioned like Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell and the Osmond Brothers). Lastly, there are a number of trailers and an exhaustive photo gallery. Whew. This really defines what a complete DVD package is all about, and in this case, it's perfectly justifiable."	5.0	An Exhaustive DVD Package and a Pristine Print Should Satisfy Fans of This Indisputable Musical Classic	2006-04-13	15	14	1

This film has the best of everything.  It is  irellevant what one thinks of the story.  This is a film that can be viewed  hundreds of times and be in awe of its masterful elements.  The attention  to detail is astounding.  For example, the minute the film starts with the  Twentieth Century Fox logo, there is no fanfare in order to create the  proper atmosphere.  All the actors including the children are perfectly  cast.  Every frame of the film is crafted brilliantly.  Considering the  location filming in Salzburg was plagued by rain, it certainly is not  evident in the finished product.  As far as Fox's DVD release is concerned,  it certainly surpasses the previous DVD releases of the other R&amp;H  musicals, but the sound still could have been mixed better.  The picture  quality is magnificent and thank God they gave us the ANAMORPHIC wide  screen format.	5.0	Filmmaking at its best	2000-09-07	0	0	0

I have again seen it hundreds of times with the whole family and everybody in the family enjoys it. It is really lovely to listen to Maria singing. We all enjoy the beautiful music and love the moving story. All the actors played their roles superbly.The movie is set in the period just before the Second World War in Salzburg, Austria. This DVD is about a lovely lady, Maria (Julie Andrews) who joined a convent to be a nun. She was full of life and she often got into trouble. The Matron of the Convent, in her infinite wisdom, decided to send her to a house of a retired captain from the Navy, Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) to be a governess for his seven unruly children. The Captain was a widower. Maria soon gets the adoration of the children whom she teaches to sing. She discovers that the unruly behaviour of the kids was due to their need for love. Maria brings love and happiness through song and caring to the von Trapp family. Maria and the Captain soon discover that they are deeply in love. The Captain had to break his engagement to Baroness Shraeder (Eleaner Parker). Unfortunately, the newly married couple are forced to flee their country that is occupied by the Nazi GermansOne cannot fail to be moved by the exceptional simplicity and kindness of Maria. She loves the outdoor. My most enduring picture of her is to see her singing ""Do re mi"" running at high speed, arms spread with children following her across a footbridge.This is a highly recommended movie for the whole family for its entertainment and educational value. If you run out of gift ideas, buy this DVD for someone and you make someone extremely happy at next to no cost. At the very least, you can buy one for your school library, if they do not have it."	5.0	Among the best musical of all time	2006-02-05	1	1	0

Melillo ""gloriana"""	With its having been well over thirty years since I saw this film, a recent, second viewing let me see just how dreadful it was. Fortunately, there is no diabetes in my family, or the very viewing would have sent me into insulin shock.I well remember the era when this was produced, when much excellent music, drama, and comedy was available without their being scenes to offend anyone. I imagine Sound of Music will be popular today because, in a quite different climate, it is &quot;for the whole family.&quot; I shall pause here for a long sigh, adding that, if one of any age is looking for any sort of plot, theme, realism, dramatic action, or characterisation, the well here is dry. All that rescues this farce (besides Eleanor Parker's lines, in which I heartily concur) is Julie Andrews' glorious voice and the stunning scenery of Salzburg.One progresses from the company of nuns who are cartoon characters, to the spunky governess who transforms kids and captain just with a few cheery songs, to a picturesque escape over a non-existent mountain. During the tense, climactic scene when the Von Trapps are hiding from the Nazis, little Gretl (in an unintentionally funny line) captures the story's theme, as she asks Maria, &quot;Do you think it would help if we sang 'Our Favourite Things?'&quot; One nearly expects Maria to say that it would!	2.0	Here goes my top 500 rating	2001-08-15	43	13	30

It wasn't exactly straight forward to navigate, but once you clicked on the item, it was fine. I thoroughly enjoyed the background story of the Von Trapps and the restoration of the film.I'm not sure what it is about this movie, but children always seem to love it.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1PSO6FUJ5XS7W	Eric Hwang	The review is for this Blu-ray Limited Edition version. The movie is a definite 5-star film.We own this on VHS and DVD already, but wanted to see if there was any improvement over the 40th anniversary DVD transfer. Unfortunately, it won't play in our Blu-ray player. I have the latest firmware and added the necessary additional memory this disc seems to require, but it never gets past the Fox animated loading logo. After waiting 15 minutes, I gave up. The special features Blu-ray disc plays fine as does the DVD, but something must be strange with the Blu-ray movie disc. I had this issue only one other time when my firmware needed upgrading, but every disc since has played until now.In addition, it was delivered without any additional packaging--no outer carton, bubble-wrap or anything. Just a shipping label stuck to the shrink-wrap! When I checked out the contents, I found that the music box was damaged, but otherwise, still worked...sort of. The tune sounds a little fast and off-key. Nonetheless, since the Blu-ray doesn't seem to work, I'm considering sending it back.	2.0	Blu-ray doesn't play	2012-03-26	2	2	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AKH6N84CBOBJ6	Eric Mars	Fraulein Maria was the only mother I've ever known, and I've seen this film a zillion times, including in theaters in the 60's. The visuals are so stunning, so perfect, it's as if you're there watching them - not the actors, the characters. And the music is beautifully rendered - no surround sound remix artifacts, just beautifully rendered in stereo, better than you've ever heard it. I'm so impressed with this rendition. It's amazing they made a film with so much to say in the context of a musical of all things (and with child actors in tow). There really are no good/bad evil characters like we've come to expect. They managed to convey so many shades of gray & subtleties. After a lifetime of hating the Baroness, this viewing brought me to the realization that, after putting up a really good fight, she bowed out honorably. So many lessons about what's worth fighting for in this film.	5.0	Insanely good	2010-11-14	4	4	0

The latter is a downright disaster, while SOUND OF MUSIC, remarketed and milked for the umpteenth time is not a disaster, but a definite disappointment.High quality extras from the previous DVD were not carried over.The new extras are ""nice"", but ultimately boringThe transfer itself seems somehow fuzzier and less sharp than my old disc. I returned the new disc to the store where I bought it as ""defective"".

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	APM06HT7JIPZ5	"Erik Morton ""Erik Morton"""	THE SOUND OF MUSIC is by far the greatest musical of all time, and is among the most beloved films ever made.  I have yet to meet one person who does not possess an intimate love for this film.  I mean, I'm sitting in class, and no matter how many people are reciting rap or pop, no matter how tough they may try to act, whenever someone mentions The Sound Of Music, the whole class gets into an uproarious chorus of &quot;THE HILLS ARE AAALIIIIIVE.........&quot;, or &quot;WHEN THE DOG BITES, WHEN THE BEE STINGS.........&quot;  This 1965 Best Picture winner is truly a miracle in this sense; the film is, quite literally, timeless.But the film is not only so remembered for its music; sure, that's what you watched it for when you were four or six.  Sure, you memorized every single little lyric without even knowing what the heck it all means.  That is certainly why I used to love THE SOUND OF MUSIC.  I recently purchased this deluxe DVD after not seeing the movie for years, and I must say that I never could've imagined all that the film possessed besides music.  The acting, the storyline, the gorgeous scenery.......everything about this movie is P-E-R-F-E-C-T.Whatever you do, don't cheat yourself into buying the single-disc edition that's in stores these days (and heaven forbid the full-screen version!)  Even though this two-disc Five Star Collection DVD is out of stock on this website, it's worth the extra money.  The audio is fine, but the video is strange; most of the time it is very clear, but some times it appears blurry and hard to focus on.  However, the real reason to buy this 2-disc set is for the extras.  The making-of documentary is one of the very best I've ever seen!  It may be 90 minutes, but like the actual movie itself, it's so entertaining that it just speeds right by!  The menus are beautiful, too (like all of Fox's Five Star Collection DVDs).CONCLUSION:  One of history's most timeless classics on one spectacular DVD release.  This is one item you cannot afford to miss out on!	5.0	One Of The True Masterpieces Of The Motion Picture!	2003-06-15	11	7	4

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AJ575EY4X9V53	Ernesto Ceballos M	No doubt this is an All Time classical picture that deserve a 5 star rating. Why I rated it 3 stars? You see, I live in Mexico City and bought the DVD version to show it to the family and friends thru a home theater system to enhance the music and enjoy the 4.1 surround system. Before ordering the DVD I checked that it included subtitles in spanish so that all people that saw the picture could understand it completely. Oh big dissapointing I had. The beautiful Hammerstein's lyrics did not came translated and no spanish subtitles appeared when the songs are performed. Only two or three songs appeared translated to spanish in the subtitles. I wonder what type of genius in Fox Pictures decided not to show the spanish subtitles in most of the songs. I have the video version in english language and of course all the songs are shown translated in the subtitles so we can appreciate the great lyrics that remain great in spanish. I also bought the South Pacific DVD version and it have all the songs translated to spanish thru the subtitles. Someone know if it exists a widescreen, single disc version that include spanish subtitles with all songs translated to spanish? I would appreciate any answer.Thank youeceballosm@yahoo.com.mx	3.0	A Big Defect for spanish people	2004-03-05	17	12	5

I remember all the beautiful scenes of the Austrian countryside and wondered what Blu-Ray could do.  Well, I got my wife this Blu-Ray set (the Collector's Set of course) and though our 32"" Sharp Aquos HDTV is rather modest in size compared to what many others have, we were still in awe and blown away by this blu-ray edition.  Trust me, I don't care how many times you've seen this movie on VHS, DVD, or those chopped up airings on TV--they absolutely do not do this movie justice like the Blu Ray does.The details were so crystal clear (the main highlights are the beautiful Austrian and Swiss countryside/mountains seen at the beginning and end of the movie plus the beautiful church with the wedding but that's only a few) we literally could make out the blades of grass.Bottom line, if you can only get one movie on Blu Ray, make it this one!

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A7OVPHEKNDG9R	EuroFan	Which isn't saying much, because as a rule I hate musicals.  This one is typically cheesy: the dialog is bad, the acting is terrible, and not all the characters sang their own songs - the Captain's and the Reverend Mother's songs were both dubbed by other singers.  However, for some reason I have an emotional attachment to this movie that I just can't shake.  I love the songs, and the Austrian scenery is breathtaking.  It used to be shown on TV every Christmastime during the '70s and I remember watching it faithfully as a teenager then.  I suppose part of the reason I love this movie so much is that it takes me back to a simpler time in my life.	4.0	My favorite musical	2013-10-20	1	0	1

But this is the absolute best - I can't imagine it could be any better than this! The box set really adds an element of fun to the experience, with the books and the postcards and the music box. My ONLY complaint is that the 45th anniversary soundtrack that comes in this box set is not the same one that you can buy at Amazon. So even after spending $60 on this boxed set, I still went ahead and spent the additional $10 for the entire 25-track soundtrack (which is completely remastered and AWESOME). If you're going to buy the additional soundtrack, just buy the downloadable one, which has one track more than the CD that you have to wait to be delivered.Make sure you watch all of the special features on disc 2. So much work was put into remastering this edition of the movie, and it was all well worth it. The final product is so absolutely breathtaking.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1XOZW9A8TL7JY	Four Star Film Fan	Starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, this musical follows a light-hearted nun who becomes the governess for the seven children of a widowed Austrian naval captain. When she first meets the children they are hostile towards her but they quickly become fond of Maria. However, when the captain gets wind of their adventures he is angry. Initially Maria is sent away but then the captain has a change of heart. After an evening full of fun, Maria is sent off this time by a jealous baroness. She returns later on the urging of a nun and Von Trapp then realizes his true love for Maria. However, everything is not well as the Von Trapps get ready for the Salzburg Music Festival since the Nazis are on the rise. With a little kindly help they are able to make their getaway in the end. I have to say that this is not one of my favorite films but the soundtrack is one of the most memorable of all time and Andrew's voice is truly beautiful.	4.0	The Sound of Music (1965)	2013-06-01	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	"When it comes to family-oriented entertainment and especially musicals, it's hard to do better than ""The Sound of Music"".  Not only is the plot very compelling and believable but the songs are simply inspired classics and standards that will continue to be sung many many years from now.  This represents Rodgers and Hammerstein at the top of their creative powers and this together with ""Oklahoma"" represent my favourite musicals of all time.This dvd version is the full-screen one and after viewing this a couple of times I can't help but feel that I should have gotten the widescreen version instead although as far as full-screen versions go, this is not bad.  The picture quality is well restored although not perfect as not every frame is without some form of minor defect but this is not enough to detract from your viewing enjoyment.  The sound quality is very good though coming in Dolby Digital 4.1 Surround format.  There are no Bonus features of note such as documentaries etc which is disappointing but here's hoping the upcoming Blu-ray version improves upon the picture, sound and bonus features aspects enough for us to shout about.As far as standard full-screen version dvds go though, this version suffices as a must have in any musical fan's dvd library although you may want to wait for the Blu-ray version if you are intending to upgrade any time soon."	4.0	The Best Family Musical Ever!

Well, something has. This transfer to Blu ray is so beautiful it makes me want to cry! I'm truly seeing it for the first time! I've discovered things i didn't even know were there. Every mark etched on the walls and floors of the abby, every thread on the costumes fabric, the leaves on the trees, I could go on. People responsible for this transfer: Thank you!

Not only is the acting superb behind a seasoned,  all - star cast, behind Julie Andrews and Christpher Plummer, but the singing, choreography,  direction, cinematography,  and writing are the best of any motion picture made that year, it has a poignant story and message the world should never forget--goodness, love, and faith will carry one through difficult times. The film is a classic that will thrill audiences for years to come, and enlighten them as well. I highly recommend this film.	5.0	Ten Star Review!	2014-04-24	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1XP1YMTGRWOQQ	Gabby's Mom	I just bought this version and haven't had time to play all of the special features, but there seems to be a lot of commentaries and less behind the scene videos. I would love to see the deleted scenes or video of the actors while filming this movie, but I think it's too much to ask since this movie was made in the mid 60's. They did a great job in restoring it though. The quality of the picture is very good, almost as if it was recently made, which led me to discovery of why all actresses back then looked so beautiful and their faces looked perfectly smooth and wrinkle-free... LOL.However, I think this is by far the cheesiest, corniest yet funny and romantic movie I have ever seen.The funniest scenes are when the Captain blew his whistle to summon his children and when Maria blew her whistle to ask for Captain's own signal. The look on his face was priceless.The most romantic scene is the Laendler scene, where their relationship started to bloom.The cheesiest and corniest scene is the gazebo scene between Maria and the Captain. Somehow, I don't see any chemistry between them. Maybe it's the way the Captain touched Maria or his exaggerated voice when asking for Maria's relative to ask permission, I'm not sure. To me the Laendler scene is more convincing in showing their blooming romance.The most unforgettable songs are Edelweiss and Do re mi (even my 2yo loves these songs and can sing to them).Overall, I love this movie, especially the handsome Captain, played effectively by Chris Plummer. I think he should be nominated for Academy Award instead of Peggy Wood who played Reverend Mother... But this is different story.I feel kind of sorry for the Baroness, since she's not a real villain, but someone who traveled all the way to Salzburg to get acquainted with her beau's children only to be intercepted by their governess/charmer. However I don't disapprove of Maria and Georg's romance, since that's the plot... LOL. Eleanor Parker was convincing in her role as Baroness.Julie Andrews was also effective in playing a cheerful, innocent and outspoken governess with a gifted voice. It was a little bit disappointing when after the wedding, she suddenly played a role of a doting but reserved and obedient wife.As for the dubbing issue and the apathy from Chris Plummer... I don't really care. They shouldn't have dubbed his singing since it was fine... Although it was a bit shaky, it sounded sincere and more realistic coming from someone who hadn't sung in years. Perhaps, this (and the fact that he was somewhat limited to similar roles as Captain von Trapp after this movie) is why he dislikes this movie so much up to this day.	5.0	The cheesiest, corniest yet funny and romantic movie of all time	2007-09-09	2	1	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1G9FX1KV45N41	Gary Selikow	The Sound of Music is a wonderful, romantic, family values, jam-packed musical set in Austria in the late 1930's. It tells of the nun, Maria, who comes to be the governess for seven cute kids, the children of Baron Von Trapp, a widower and former Admiral.Despite some initial opposition from disciplinarian Von Trapp, she injects life and fun into the household. Plenty of fabulous songs, which will survive forever. It is set when the Nazi forces extend their malignant web into Austria, showing how beauty and innocence can be threatened by malignant ideologies like Nazism, Communism, Bolshevism and Palestinianism.The Sound of Music is a classic, certainly a valuable reminder of innocence, beauty and family values to hold onto in the rather dark days of terrorism and loss of values we seem to have entered- perhaps the darkest since the days of Hitler.	5.0	Reminder of the age of innocence	2004-03-31	2	1	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AQRNI6QDWMWHL	Gehan Cooray	This is JUST the type of musical the entire family can enjoy. I was really really little when I first saw it, and I have loved it ever since. It has everything a movie/musical needs : an exciting plot, romance, suspense,  danger, humour, sad moments, happy moments, not to mention a splendid  Rodgers and Hammersteins score. It is probably the most memorable musical  ever. Julie Andrews was born to play Maria, and Christopher Plummer did a  superb job portraying the self-righteous Captain Von Trapp, so  good-looking,  so manly. My favourite character is the proud, heartless,  jealous baroness who was portrayed so 'exquisitely' by Eleanor Parker. And  last but by no means the least, the children who were splendid, not to  mention Liesel's lover : Rolfe. My fav. songs are MARIA, SIXTEEN GOING ON  SEVENTEEN &amp; CLIMB EV'RY MOUNTAIN. However, I like MY FAIR LADY &amp;  THE KING AND I more than this, yet I still feel that this was Rodgers and  Hammertsein's greatest triumph. The songs are much nicer in THE KING AND I,  and I prefer Marni Nixon's singing voice to Julie Andrews' for teh simple  reason that it's more 'sweet' and 'smoothe'. I think Marni Nixon plays the  role of Sister Sophia, which reminds me, the Nuns were my other set of fav.  characters, as they are 'typical' nuns. As THE KING AND I and THE SOUND OF  MUSIC are Rodgers and Hammerstein's greatest hits, there's a Julie Andrews  vs Deborah Kerr, Christopher Plummer vs Yul Brynner saga. In any case, THE  KING AND I is more touching than THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and I liked the subtle  Anna/The King romance better than the the Maria/Captain Von Trapp romance.  However, THE SOUND OF MUSIC is rather simmilar to THE KING AND I in many  ways. For instance, THE KING AND I itself is based on a British Governess  who travels to Siam in order to tutor the King of Siam's children, the same  way Maria leaves the Abbes in order to be governess to Captain Von Trapp's  children. Then the conversation between Maria/The House-keeper is rather  like the conversation between Anna/Lady Thiang. The secret love affair of  Liesel/Rolfe is simmilar to Tuptim and Lun Tha's love affair, and Captain  Von Trapp himself is much rather like the self-righetous, arrogant King of  Siam. In addition, the Lonely Goatherd is much rather like the famous  'Small House of Uncle Thomas - Ballet' from THE KING AND I. Plus, Mother  Abbess's advising song CLIMB EV'RY MOUNTAIN resembles Lady Thiang's  SOMETHING WONDERFUL in which she counsels Anna on the King. However, as  much as I like THE KING AND I more than THE SOUND OF MUSIC, it is better  developed than KING AND I, and it will always remain everybody's favourite  family musical, and I'd much rather see THIS than TITANIC any day. The most  important message you can learn from this is that God's Will always leads  one to joy, content and happiness, no matter how difficult and impossible  it may seem as first. The other reviewers are right. On a scale from one to  ten, this musical deserves ELEVEN stars...	5.0	ONE OF THE BEST FAMILY MUSICALS OF ALL-TIME	2000-03-06	5	2	3

The detail in the picture is just amazing, it's a whole new experience. The sound restoration is remarkable, it's deep and rich and full. Fox have really gone to town with the extras not only do we get all the extras from previous editions but a host of new and rare items to make an astonishing collection. This is one of the best Blu-ray editions yet.The Sound of Music has always been a superlative film. Every aspect of the film work.

What surprised me most was to discover how absolutely terrible this movie is.If you like the music I guess you can fast forward through the rest of it.. but why not just buy the soundtrack? Why suffer through this abomination? I cannot really fault the actors, they do a reasonable enough job. I think they should be congratulated for keeping a straight face while participating in this bare-faced theatrical fraud.From my point of view a film should attempt to be a believable portrayal of reality, or if not, there should be some point made by its disconnection with reality, whether that point be satirical or strictly humorous. This film wallows in the most unbelievable sentimental drivel from first scene to last. There isn't a single moment in the entire movie where you are under the impression that you are doing anything other than watching actors deliver mind-numbingly stupid lines.Oddly enough I was actually looking forward to watching this movie, I had fond memories of it as a child. Maybe that's all it ever was, propaganda for children. A 'how to behave' movie for kids before they are smart enough to know better.

I also think the film is  beautifully shameless in its manipulations:  all that gorgeous scenery, the  rousing soundtrack, great lyrics, Julie Andrews' voice, children climbing  trees, nuns with hearts of gold,  Nazi's that aren't quite on the ball, and  who are hated by all the Austrians (be sure to put away your history  books).And, oh, the delicious governess issue.  Maria (Julie Andrews)  takes a break from the convent (she hasn't taken final vows) to try the  world outside -- as a governess to seven children.  The Baron she serves  falls in love with her.  Natch!  The shades of Jane Eyre, and innumerable  other literary and filmic ghosts. hover over the video. The formula just  plain works -- and I screen my child-care providers carefully.  The Von  Trapp marriage (a nice one, but sex is kept tightly under wraps -- after  all, he's a control freak and she's practically a nun) makes for a great  Cathedral scene.  Then the plot, well, thickens.  The evil Nazis threaten  to ruin everything.  The Von Trapps head for the mountains to a new life  (with a brief heart-stopping stay at the convent before-hand). They look  absolutely great as they tromp through the mountains. Curtain!And silly  as some of it is, I always reach for the tissues. Go ahead.  Wallow in this  video.  Live the fantasy (but remember it's a fantasy).  Love the music.  Love those singing nuns and hate those Nazis. Love the voice of Julie  Andrews.But be careful if you're in the market for a governess.	5.0	What is it About Governesses?	2000-09-04	2	2	0

It is jubilant, heartbreaking and ultimately uplifting to the spirit, this film demonstrates and is a tribute to all the goodness there is in the world and what life has to offer and what we can strive for. I saw this film when I was a little boy and well it was good I suppose but it has grown to mean much more to me with each passing year. There is goodness and love and tragedy in the world as I have now come to realize but when your spirits are low you can return to this film and remember and savor the lessons you have learned and reflect back and see parallels in the images that you once never truly saw. For a film that is greatness I suppose. Someone recently reintroduced me to this film and it has taken on a whole new meaning for me. Happiness is where you find it and make it. The one character that left an indelible image with me was Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte). Captain Von Trappe (Christopher Plummer) implores him to ""Come with us."" Rolfe had his chance to live life as a human being but he chose otherwise and in doing so gave up his chance for happiness. As a viewer, choose happiness and indulge yourself in this film. You will truly take away something of value each time you view it.Such great talents are associated with this film. The prolific Robert Wise once again demonstrated his vast array of directorial talents (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, EXECUTIVE SUITE, THE HAUNTING, WEST SIDE STORY, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW, RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP) being able to produce yet another gem regardless of the genre. That is a rare thing and Wise certainly seemed like the man for that job on this film given his gentle demeanor and eye for good storytelling. Screenwriter Ernest Lehman is another prolific talent with screenplays for EXECUTIVE SUITE, SABRINA, NORTH BY NORTHWEST and THE KING AND I to his name. Production Designer Boris Leven also was another prolific fellow with production designs such as GIANT, JOHN PAUL JONES and WEST SIDE STORY to his name. The entire cast is excellent. Julie Andrew's nave yet intuitive qualities as Maria matched against the outwardly stern and overtly proud Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trappe, who's personalities must eventually come together in order for them to become life loved partners is brilliantly performed by these two. Particular note should be made to Richard Hayden's performance as Max Detweiler Von Trappe's friend otherwise talent agent who acts as the liaison with the audience with his wry visual expressions."	5.0	So Endearing to So Many	2013-09-17	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A5WMBIOGE8Q6N	"Golden Lion ""Reader"""	"""You have brought music back into my home"".  This is a story about a man, who lost his wife, suffered loneliness, realized the value of his family and embraces his family once again in music and drama, and falls in love with a woman of great culture and life.Tensions are high between Germany and Austria.  Nazi Germany threats to occuppy Austria, raping the country of his sovereignty and independance.  The Van Trap family represents the Austrian culture, naval might, and defiance of their conquerors.The Sound of Music withstands the test of time: scenery, key landmarks, picture quality alp mountains, and religous moral ideals. Julie Andrews represents the spirit of independant woman, the virtueous ideals of Mary, the zest for experience and excitement and life, and the moral courage to stand up against evil.

When I first saw this movie I could have been no more than 5 my grandfather took me to the theater to see two movies I don't remember what the first one was, but man when the Sound of Music came on I was taken away it was like I was part of the von Trapp family.  Oh the songs were the best my two  favorites are: These are a few of my favorite things and Do Ra Mi Fa So La Te.  I thought Julie Andrews was the most beautiful woman I have every seen on big screen and Christopher Plummer remarkeably handsome at the time I didn't understand why this movie had me in a spell as I got older and watch repeats of it on television it wasn't the same TV edited so much I figure well I was just a kid, but never the less I still watched it everytime it came on it was just something about that movie. I introducts my children to this movie.  Now that I have it on DVD I got the same feeling I got when I first saw it at the movies with my grandfather warm and joyiness I felt like that five year old kid again.

The book of information on the stage musical, movie, actors and the Van Trapp family was very interesting.  My husband and I took our mothers to see this movie just before we were married in 1965, so it brings back some sweet memories. The little music box included in the package was broken in our first delivery which had to be returned and another set sent to us.  The sets are numbered so the two were widely apart in numbers.

What a talent!! And what a story.  Based loosely on the Von Trapp family, it encompasses what a truly family film is all about.  The children, the father, the baroness, the nun who finds her calling from God with the family who needs a real mother, and the threat of a Europe gone mad and right on the heels of Austria.

We had the double VHS set for years, with video quality that left lots to be desired, and sound that was out of sync during the entire Do-Re-Mi sequence.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3TRWCKDLYECZ2	Gryphon	First, I wanted to address a 1 star review that complained because they couldn't get the BD version to play in their BD player and got an error message about needing an upgrade.Many of the BD movies require that your Blu Ray player have the latest firmware available from it's manufacturer.  They also frequently require that the BD player have at least 1GB of additional memory in order to play the BD disk.  This is especially common with BD disks that include the BD Live option.Most players can be connected to the Internet via a standard Ethernet cable if you have a connection to the Internet via DSL or cable services.  Check your manual for instructions on how to hook your BD player to the Internet and upgrade it's firmware. It's usually done through the menu options in the BD player itself.Also check your BD player manual on what type of flash memory card or stick it uses and how to install it.  There is usually a slot for it in the rear of the player. The slot is frequently labled EXT, at least on Sony BD players. You can get these memory cards at most stores that sell electronics and cameras or order them online at Amazon.  A 1GB card or stick is usually sufficient.As for the movie, this is a fantastic transfer with stunning detail and clarity on the video and exquisite sound. Don't wait!

I won't go over the plot, as it's classic. The acting in this movie is top-notch, especially from Mrs. Andrews and Mr. Plummer. The songs are also classic (""Eidelweiss"", ""I Have Confidence In Me"", the touching ""Climb Every Mountain"" and the heart-rendering ""So Long, Farewell"", among others penned by the dynamic duo of Rodgers and Hammerstein [""The King And I"", etc.]) This movie won 5 Oscars in 1965, including Best Picture and Best Director. Julie Andrews should have won another Oscar for her unique portrayal of Maria and Christopher Plummer for his excellent portrayal of Captain Von Trapp. No matter how many times I see this classic film, the end almost makes me cry. No matter how many films they keep doing, Julie Andrews will forever be remembered as Mary Poppins and Maria and Christopher Plummer for his role as the Captain. No other actor could've done it better than they did. This is a movie I would definitely recommend for the entire family. Rated G."	5.0	One Of The Greatest Musicals Of All Time.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2BVCT2MPS6LHI	Huge Viking	"I first saw ""The Sound of Music"" shortly after its release in 1965, directed by Robert Wise based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical. This was also based on a true story, which takes place in Salzburg, Austria in 1939 prior to World War II when Austria was about to fall into the hands of the Nazi-supported Anschluss. Probably considered by many to be her best role, Julie Andrews plays Maria whose biggest wish was to become a nun, but was constantly led to the beauty of the mountains and arrives late to the covenant. She then gets sent away by the Reverend Mother to care for seven children as a governess belonging to Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a retired naval officer and widower who maintains discipline in the home - that was until Maria arrives and wins the hearts of the children through music as well as winning the heart of Captain Von Trapp himself.The opening scene is breathtaking, showing the Austrian Alps and the beauty of the landscape until Julie Andrews comes into view where she does that turn and begins to sing the title song. This would have been perfect in 3D.In reality the Von Trapps, after their daring escape from the Nazis at the Salzburg Festival, fled to Switzerland, and it was after the war they settled in Stowe, Vermont. My parents had the opportunity to personally meet John Trapp, the son of Maria Von Trapp, who was attending Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and was a schoolmate of a personal friend of our family during the early sixties.Higly recommended, this film brings a lot of delight to those who watch it with its music and scenery all blended into one."	5.0	A Great Panoramic Musical	2005-06-08	3	3	0

It still holds the magic, and now I can say its a classic for all the family.Yes, now I see details I previously did no see. The plot is so idillic that you don't feel the nazi presence inspiring fear, the love scenes are a perfect example of puritanism and political correctness. Yet there is love and there Julie Andrews gives a performance larger than life to captivate all public.I do not know why in the review preface there is some critisims of the lyrics of the song ""Sound of music""- those were elaborated lyrics and none of that senseless rap or overly simplistic lyrics. Sugarcoated? You bet, but just like the pinl lemonade they were sipping on the terrace, ""its not too sweet, not too acid, its just too pink ""The movie has an ending that is rather sudden, just as it starts with that glorious song it should have ended with one as well, a triumph song.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3JV7KL1ECLZB8	I. Giles	This three disc 45th anniversary Blu-ray set, packed with extras, will be a dream ticket for all those who saw the original cinema production and have known the previous DVDs, including the 40th anniversary edition, to fall short of that memory.The songs are, of course, glorious peaks of the American Songbook and the emotional icing on the cake. They follow one after another with utterly memorably melodies combined with equally memorable lyrics - a tremendous example of sustained musical invention at the highest level in this genre. The plot and production of this very popular musical is too well-known to require further comment other than to add that on this new Blu-ray all is revealed with far greater clarity and fullness of colour than previously.The technical restoration of this film is a remarkable achievement with finely restored colour and a well restored soundtrack in DTS-HD master audio surround. This is an enormous improvement over all previous editions and is a remarkable example of the possibilities of modern restoration processes which have triumphantly overcome the considerable problems of film degradation.In my opinion this is a totally successful restoration of a perennial favourite and fully deserving of a 5 star rating. It should give much pleasure to all of those who are wondering if purchasing yet another 'upgrade' is justified. It is!	5.0	A remarkably successful Blu-ray restoration of a popular classic	2012-07-07	2	2	0

Let's list some of my favorite things about this movie: A breathtaking score by Richard Rodgers, a lush orchestration of the same, sun washed cinematography, wonderful scenery of Austria, vocals by the three octave  range Andrews and the children, a fun story line with just enough history to teach us something, an intriguing romance, and not one foul word, stabbing, overblown special effect, sex perversion or bloodstain to spoil it all. The editing is so good that it is unnoticeable - but effective.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1XUT212ZGISUC	James R Beverley Jr	The Sound of Music with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer is by far the best musical ever produced. I have only one complaint and that is the File System. I don't know if all the different copies of it are the same, but the 40th Anniversary edition with two discs has an UNKNOWN  File System.  File specs are ZERO. This is a mistake that causes some Optical Drives trouble. They cannot READ the disc. Why was this allowed? Most DVDs are File System UDF. My laptop Optical Drive cannot read my copy of &#34;Sound...&#34; . I believe my only option is to buy a BluRay player. The cost of replacing the laptop drive probably would be greater than the cost of a BluRay. If anyone has a better solution, please let me know..

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	APF9MW1YUQMKO	James V. Ruocco	No matter how many times you've seen this 1965 musicalization of the 1959 stage classic, it's still a joy to behold. For me, there are many reasons. On location filming in Saltzburg heightens the story's magnitude. The casting of Julie Andrews as Maria Von Trapp was a coup for both 20th Century Fox and director Robert Wise. She's magnificent and ever so professional. Back then, this was only her third Hollywood movie. But she's a pro from start to finish. Everything she does it fraught with such emotion and conviction, you'd swear she was Maria Von Trapp.  Opening up the stage play with several new scenes, sub plots, songs, characters and dialogue also benefits what could have been a very sticky situation. Finally, there's the DVD itself. This is the widescreen version that was shown back in theaters when the film first opened. It includes the intermission and the Act II opening music. With no formatting for television, you get to see everything in all it's technicolor glory. On video, half the Von Trapp children didn't fit on the televsion screen. Musical numbers lost there scope as did scenes where you had 13 characters in one room and only saw 7 on the screen.  I highly recommend this DVD. But wait, there's more. The 87-minute documentary is awesome. So are segments showing scenes that were cut and up dates on how the kids look today.	5.0	The Hills Are Alive...Now and Forever	2001-08-22	9	8	1

Past restorations have fallen quite short, slapping this classic in the face with everything from horrible skin tones to seemingly ""jumping"" color palettes mid-shot.It's truly breathtaking the images, clarity and vividness they were able to restore from not just the picture, but the audio as well. The small details that really come through now  let you get fully immersed in this film. Even the standard DVD included, while obviously not as sharp or stunning as the blu-ray, is a far better release then the last restoration.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2OU415LB9I5J6	Jason C. Wilkerson	Maria Rainer (Julie Andrews), a candidate to become a nun at the Nonnberg Abbey in Austria, is a bit of a problem for the nuns. So to help her determine if she's truly ready to become a nun she's sent to be the governess for the stern Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children, who've driven away all of their former governess's. Soon they warm up to Maria, though, as does the Captain, and together they change the way the von Trapp household is run.Based on the true story of the von Trapp Family Singers, The Sound of Music was the last musical written by Rodgers and Hammerstein as Oscar Hammerstein II died of cancer in 1960. Originally conceived as a Broadway musical that opened up in 1959, the rights changed hands several times before the film was eventually made. Since then The Sound of Music has become the third highest grossing movie of all time when it's grosses are adjusted for inflation (just behind Gone With the Wind and Star Wars respectively) and saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy after the flop of 1963's Cleopatra.Surprisingly, considering I'm not typically a big fan of musicals with a few exceptions, I actually have to say that I did enjoy The Sound of Music. Of course, this has less to do with the music than the fact that the characterizations are full and complete, allowing you to lose yourself in the characters and feel for their plights and passions. The plotting is also quite taut for a film that's almost three hours long, keeping you on the edge of your toes with the character's personal crises as well as with the outward crises that lands in Austria with the Nazis in the latter parts of the film.The acting is very well done, as that's what really gets you invested in the characters. At the time The Sound of Music went into production Julie Andrews was largely unknown as Mary Poppins hadn't been released, but she nails the part of the innocent and free spirited Maria. Christopher Plummer, who famously didn't enjoy working on the film (later referring to it as The Sound of Mucus) doesn't let on on screen his displeasure with the film, and still you feel the characters distaste for the Nazi regime and his love for Maria as well as his transformation from stern father figure to hands on patriarch.The biggest problem with The Sound of Music is that its a little too sweet, dripping with saccharine. This also means that some of the musical sequences can come off a bit to extremely cheesy, but even through that the film still feels genuine. And while I understand the need to make changes to a real life story in a film, every once in a while a filmmakers choices of change can be a little insulting to the subject of the film. The real Captain von Trapp, as stated by his children and his wife Maria, was not a stern man, and did not run his family like a military platoon as depicted in the film. Despite the pleadings of Maria and his children, the filmmakers decided to keep the characterization in the movie, which seems to me a little insulting to his memory.Overall, though, I do have to say that I enjoyed this movie. It gives an interesting depiction, especially towards the end of what Austrian citizens had to go through after the Nazi invasion. If you like musicals, or want to be transported to a more innocent time I highly recommend this movie. Just be careful after watching the movie or you could find yourself humming Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs for the next several weeks!4/5	4.0	The Sound of Music	2010-06-06	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A106016KSI0YQ	Jay Dickson	It's been fashionable to make fun of THE SOUND OF MUSIC even before it came out, when, during its filming, Christopher Plummer reportedly referred to it sneeringly as &quot;The Sound of Mucas.&quot; Pauline Kael's infamous vitriolic (and very funny) review of it sealed her reputation as one of America's grand culture mavens--and set the tone for the film's later criticisms by characterizing it as soulless and manipulative.But this reputation is largely unearned. Certainly the children are at times hard to take (especially Charmian Carr, who seems simultaneously vixenish--&quot;tooooooo wriiiiiiiite onnnnnnn&quot;--and wholesome, as if she were a mutant hybrid of Ann-Margret and Doris Day). But the film is extremely visually inventive, especially in its contrasts of the cramped spaces of the Captain's villa and the beautiful open exteriors of Salzburg and the surrounding Alps. And most critics have overlooked that the film's scenarists have worked in an audience surrogate to sneer at Maria's goody-goodyness in the person of the Countess. Memorably played by Eleanor Parker, the Countess is given to all kinds of snide comments when things get too sugary (&quot;My dear, is there anything you *don't* do?&quot;).Best of all, the film has at its center the amazing Julie Andrews, who makes the best Maria imaginable. She really does make you believe in Maria's kindness and simplicity, and her love of the outdoors. In her two most iconic moments--spinning on the moutaintop during the title number, and leading the children at top speed through a footbridge during &quot;Do Re Mi&quot;-- her arms are characteristically spread wide, accepting the entirety of the beautiful world around her. And has anybody who has seen her ever forgotten how she closes &quot;Do Re Mi,&quot; hitting that perfect &quot;fa&quot; as she leaps up the steps? This performance alone forever cements Andrews's status as an icon in world cinema.	4.0	Julie spinning on a mountaintop: it doesn't get any better	2001-04-11	0	0	0

The re-issue of this classic film on DVD makes  it a masterpiece.  The entire film has been digitally remastered for both  the audio quality and picture quality.

The second disc contains LOTS of information about the film,  including audio commentaries and documentaries about the making of the  film.  In addition there are sections that contain a large amount of  background information on Maria and Georg von Trapp - before and after what  is shown in the film.	5.0	Sound of Digital Music	2000-08-26	3	3	0

Julie Andrews is a very good actress and a singer but Maria von Trapp wasn't theRole for her. I think that with her rich English accent and sopranic voice would have made a perfect Baroness. At least I enjoyed the brilliant acting by all the actors. AllOf them fitted the role perfectly. If they worked on the original script by Howard LindsayAnd Russel Crouse.

It is a gem, a jewel, a diadem in the crown of musical cinema.This wonderful movie, beloved and familiar to so many, comes with a series of extra features that deepen one's appreciation for this excellent film. The making of TSOM is told through interviews with the film's stars, its director Robert Wise, and others intimate with the film's development. It was fun watching these Hollywood pros dance around the evident awfulness of the stage version of the movie; fascinating to see how Christopher Plummer brought humanity to the otherwise uni-dimensional role of Captain von Trapp; horrifying to imagine the misplacement of songs in the stage play (""Raindrops on Roses"" sung by Mother Superior?) and heavenly to realize their perfect placement in the film. The very 1960s filmlet, starring Charmian Carr (Liesl) as a young ing&eacute;nue in Strausburg, was eye-rollingly innocent and a neat behind-the-scenes view of the filming.TSOM is cloyingly sweet and schmaltzy to some, and a deliriously joyful extravaganza to others.

It certainly will not be 1080p Hi-Def with 7.1 DTS-HD Sound, but the difference is just not worth discarding your 'The Sound of Music' DVD to re-purchase this 45th Anniversary re-mastered blu-ray.My advice to you then? ... Just addThe Sound of Music (Three-Disc DVD/Blu-ray set)to your wish list and wait. ... There's always an occasion for gift giving and ... for receiving! :))	5.0	This classic movie on blu-ray is a great gift idea for any occasion	2010-12-27	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3Q8DVFUYF0R40	Jeff Stambovsky	How is Captain Von Trapp not the best father EVER? He's a former Commander in the Austrian Navy (????--lots of lake-based War Games, I suppose) who has of late become a widower raising seven kids in his beloved homeland, now post-Anschluss and overrun with brown-shirted thugs, including an 18-year-old Hitler Youth poster boy named Rolf who's been hitting on his super-hormonal 16-going-on-17-year-old daughter (redundant, I know).Obviously overwhelmed by circumstances and with no-one to confide in but Max, his cliche-spouting music producer friend with Liberace's flamboyance and Michael Jackson's judgment, he winds up making some questionable lifestyle decisions, like dumping his money-honey sexpot Baroness GF in favor of a completely bedroom-untested Salzburg nun with nothing but a guitar, an Ipana smile, and an eerie pre-hip-hop ability to rhyme on the fly. In English. The Nazis, whom he strongly opposes, are pressuring him with some not-so-veiled threats against his family to accept a high-level commission with the Reich he so despises. Escape from an occupied homeland surrounded by forbidding mountains with seven kids and a guitar-lugging wife in tow would seem an iffy long-shot at best, even if you just watched the hapless Jets beat the undefeated Colts a mere hour or so earlier. And yet in the face of all of this, he manages to keep his eye on the prize, pushing his kids to learn a half-dozen or so great R&H; tunes, even to the point of making sure that they get those tricky Rodgers harmonies right.You, sir, are a Great Father for the ages.	5.0	Greatest Father Ever!!!!	2010-01-04	3	1	2

The description says there is a music box, but when I asked her what song it plays, she said neither her or her husband could recognize the tune.  I assumed it would play &#34;My Favorite Things&#34;, but not so.  Does anyone know what tune the music box plays?  My 3 star rating is due to this one glitch.	3.0	Music Box song?	2013-09-20	0	0	0

There is actually more stuff in this set than I will ever be interested in--I am not big on watching interviews and documentaries about the making of movies.  Nonetheless, it is very nicely packaged (oh, and pretty big--about the size of a coffee table book and 4 inches thick) but will take up a lot of room on your video shelf...if it even fits!  It did come over-packed though, because it came in a very sturdy shipping box which Amazon in turn put into another shipping box to mail it to me.  Oh well.  Still a super nice addition to the collection and I have loved this movie since I was a kid.	5.0	Great for the Sound of Music Lover...and the future ones	2012-12-27	2	0	2

Good quality book with a bit of interesting history.  The certificate was slightly bent, but that didn't bother me.  However, the music box was very, very tin-like.  I was very disappointed in it.  I expected it to be have a cheap snow globe-like sound to it, but it really sounded bad.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1QXNP7RFQKTS9	Jessica Anya Blau, author, THE WONDER BREAD S...	. . .  is the fact that I can't get my young daughter to sit through this movie!  Perhaps I should think of some way to bribe her into watching it.  I suppose I could tell her that she can't watch television EVER AGAIN IN HER LIFE unless she sits though The Sound of Music!I first saw it at the movie theater.  My friends and I walked back to the theater and watched it three days in a row.  I don't know how many times I've seen it since, but I do know this: I can't look at thick curtains without thinking of pulling them down and having a dress sewn from them.  I can't look at a brown paper package tied up with string (and string-tied packages are, sadly, so rare these days) without hearing the Favorite Things song in my head.  I can barely hear the words SIXTEEN and SEVENTEEN in the same sentence without singing THAT song!So, yes, the movie is in my heart and in my head.  Now if only I could figure out some way to get it into my daughter's head!  I'm open to suggestions if anyone wants to send them to me.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	ATELSGYOHCL3E	Jessica	Whether you like or dislike this movie, that's up to you. Not everyone has the same taste. So, I'll just tell you what I like about this DVD version:-The sound is awesome. They have enhanced it with the THX digitally mastered format.-Disc1 has the movie, the DVD-ROM stuff and the audio commentary by Robert Wise. So as you play the movie, he tells you about certain scenes.-Disc2 has everything a true fan would want. It contains documentaries, audio supplements, interviews, production stills, trailers, radio and TV sports and DVD-ROM games.-The movie comes in widescreen format. On a big TV, this is no biggie. It's actually better because you are watching the movie as it was presented at the theater.-The quality of the picture is ... well DVD quality. With that I mean, the very nice and sharp quality VHS lacks.What I don't like?Well, nothing. If I were to find something I don't like, it would be the option of having the widescreen and tv-screen versions included. I wonder if that would take three discs though. But I like it as it is offered.Finally, I love the movie. I've watched it so many times, and I know I'll keep watching it forever. The only difference is that now I get to see it at such good quality and with all those behind-the-scenes extras I always wondered about.:)	5.0	A better sound of Sound of Music	2002-01-09	9	7	2

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3INWG0NDWP0YE	J. G. Bennett	"I loved this movie. Julie Andrews was great, she has a voice that was just amazing...I realize that many of the younger viewers wont understand what's coming out of her mouth since she is actually SINGING and not just 'rapping' or using some cheap electronic tricks to mimic talent. The other thing they are doing in the movie is dancing...I realize no one is 'grindin dey azz' against anyone else's groin; and sure you can't see any nipples bouncing out of clothes, but trust me they are dancing.I think the best part of the movie is that our kids can learn history. I realize that WWII is kind of covered in school now, but do they teach you that not only were the Nazis mean, but they were great dancers too? I didn't think so. Also, remember that Nazi was the name for the ""National Socialist"" party in Germany (sort of like Democrat is the name for socialist in this country), and since we are heading rapidly into socialism we need to learn that it will be much more tolerable if we learn to dance and sing about tiny flowers. It will make the next few years so much more tolerable.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1XSXUBCNFIM3W	Jim Jr	My copy of &quot;Sound of Music&quot; on DVD arrived today and what a wonderful package it is. The film is on one disk, the second contains  documentaries on Salzburg (where it was filmed) and the making of the film  with commentaries from most of the creative people. The DVD set is worth  the price for this second disk alone. There are also audio interviews with  cast members and lots of other features. Julie Andrews tells some  delightful things about problems in filming such as the wind from the  helicopter that filmed the famous opening segment on the hill top knocking  her down at the end of a number of takes for the scene.Everyone must  know about the film and what a wonderful family entertainment it is. A bit  corny and sentimental, yes, but there is good reason it was the Oscar  winner for best picture. Julie Andrews was born to play this part,  Christopher Plummer is just right as Baron Von Trapp. It could not be  better cast. (It is a bit of a shock to see two of the children during  their interviews as adults today.) The clarity of the picture, the sound,  everything is wonderful in this package.Even if you have a previous  video tape of Sound of Music, this is the one to have now. If you don't  have a DVD player, this film alone should convince you to get one.If I  could give it 10 stars, I would.	5.0	What a bargin - GREAT DVD package	2000-08-31	3	3	0

Shadow tones are as I would expect on film.  Details in the church are clear, but not artificially so.  Screen ratio is correct.  I was only using stereo TV speakers, but the sound is far clearer than the usual hifi VHS and the audio cassettes of my childhood.  In fact, because of the truer sound, I found myself enthralled by slower scenes which have zonked me out in the past.  For instance, when the Captain plays Edelweiss, and that guitar strum softly lulls you to sleep, or when Gretel sings, &#34;The sun...has gonnne...to bed and so must IIIII...&#34;-- these scenes used to put me to sleep with the soft background hiss.  Now I stay focused on the words of Edelweiss.  It's actually quite a moving tribute to a nation under seige and it brought a tear to my eye.  As Gretel is carried up the steps, I can hang in there for the grownup drama to follow.  Picture so close to the original it may bring a tear to your eye, sound so close to the original it may rekindle your childhood love for the music.  Plus, being a combo pack, you've got a loaner DVD for parents and kids who tend to borrow movies and not return them.	5.0	Unless you saw it in the theater, you've never seen it this clear	2013-10-18	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3DU192QOTZ06G	"JMF ""old school"""	What better example of the glories of Western civilization than the beautiful melodies of Rodgers and Hammerstein set amidst the Austrian Alps during the mid twentieth century. The title song is an example indicative of the unique contribution of the West in world history as the force behind the most melodic expression of music written in the major key. The Christian church's influence in its development cannot be underestimated. However, I would be remiss not to mention the ominous threat posed to its expression by the rise of the fascist regime portrayed in the film. There are obvious parallels that one can see today as we see the rise of fundamentalist Islam and the spread of its influence across the face of Europe. It is not all that unlikely to imagine a scenario where the crosses on top of the cathedrals in the film being replaced by minarets and the beautiful songs written in the major key being outlawed and being replaced by the wailing of calls to prayer with no time signature or melody to speak of. Perhaps the rarity of great musicals such as this one in our time is symptomatic of the decline of the West as we've known it. Could it be that we are in need of a spiritual awakening based upon biblical Christianity to counteract this decline? My wife's comment was she thought the movie was about a lady singing on a hillside!	5.0	A Celebration of Western Civilization	2010-12-01	6	2	4

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A38WJ3VS0H7L2M	Joanne Madison T.	I watched the movie last year and i thought it was pretty good.The story is about a free-spirited young novice nun who was sent to be governess for the seven unmanageable children of a widowed captain. There, she caught the hearts of the children, and unknowingly, the heart of their father too.Loosely adapted from Rodgers and Hammerstein's all-time classic, and inspired by a true story, the sound of music really does live up to its name. Like any archetypical music drama, it features some of the immortal songs ever written like &quot;I have Confidence&quot; and &quot;How to solve the problem of Maria.&quot;Entirely shot in Salzburg with an A-list cast, the movie bagged five Oscars, including Best Picture. It showcases the sweeping beauty of Austria. With Julie Andrews as lead Maria, who won Best Actress for her role as the magical nanny Mary Poppins, she returns with a wonderful performance singing and dancing and mingling with children here. Christopher Plummer, a veteran actor who looked like a forever grimacing idol, plays her beloved. Charmien Carr, as eldest daughter Liesl, shines too, with her versatile voice and graceful moves (ballet moves, if you call it).I'd think this is one brilliant film...as i've mentioned above,A-list actors,breathtaking view and wonderful as well as unforgettable songs.With singing and dancing and the strumming of the guitar, there is only one word to sum the movie: it's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!	4.0	Not supercalifragilisticexpialidocious but serenplidity!	2004-06-13	3	1	2

When she was going away to college she wanted to get the DVD version since the TV has a built in DVD player.  Couldn't find it anywhere in stores, so on a whim I checked Amazon.

Sold!This has been remastered and is in surround sound. The first time I watched it I was blown away. I caught details in the film that I didn't even know were there! It was amazing!The special features are almost more interesting than the movie itself! Interviews with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and the actors who played the 7 children, even a tour with one of the actors to visit all of the filming locations and showing the history behind it all.

The daisy-fresh Andrews is simply terrific, whether she's acting or singing, and the songs--""Do Re Mi,"" ""Climb Every Mountain,"" and ""My Favorite Things""--have become part of our cultural heritage. Adapted from the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway play, the film might be a bit schmaltzy at moments, but in all, it remains utterly irresistible.

Many would sneer at this film because it has been so overly made fun of since the Sixties, but perhaps such people should take a closer look at the true depth of the story, like I did. After having seen it in my childhood over and over again, I watched it recently after it sat on the shelf for many years. I went in with an open mind and was literally moved to tears by the story. The film's true beauty lies not in the cheesy musical numbers or in Julie Andrews dancing around the Alps, but in the courage and determination of the family to sing about life and freedom in the face of Nazi oppression. The &quot;sound of music&quot; is the sound of freedom and hope. To see the opposing forces at work in this movie is to grasp the essence of The Sound of Music. What a heartbreaking drama. Take away the score and the film still stands as a triumph of moviemaking.	5.0	great film	2001-12-31	7	3	4

This same story is told through the movies &quot;The Trapp Family&quot;, and &quot;The Trapp family Goes To America,&quot; etc. There are actually a series of three films which make up the story.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1U0KV7DDCKYR2	"Johnny G ""Ain't it the Truth"""	This is one of the best musicals ever to emmanate out of Hollywood.  Julie Andrews is excellent as the virginal young novice Maria, who meets and falls in love with Hot hunk Georg Von Trapp and decides to make a play for him, much to the chagrin of the beautiful Baroness Von Schraeder.  But Maria's pristine good looks and polite manner captivate the Captain and the Baroness gets the boot.  The highlight of the film is when Marni Nixon appears as Sister Sophia and sings &quot;How Do You solve a Problem like Maria&quot;?  The exciting climax of the film, is when Blonde Boy Ralph, who has been chosen as one of Hitler's Youth, cries out &quot;Lieutenant!&quot; and almost gives their whereabouts away.

The Sound of Music, the Blu-ray format, the superb sound, the two-disc combo, and it goes on and on.  For anyone who desires a 45-year trip back into movie history, this is the DVD for them.  I toured Salzburg in 1986, and at the time I only took still photographs of my journey through the streets and climbs on the mountains.  With the 45th Anniversary Edition of The Sound of Music, the hills were alive for me once again, and the special features included with the disc combo, provided a special video memory for me to keep as well.

Next time you see it, look for the small details and prepare to be amazed.  Robert Wise was a master filmmaker.  Watch how carefully and beautifully constructed and lit every shot is.  Look at the sets and location shots, who since Robert Wise in 1965 has done created this kind of aching, beautiful detail??  Drop any tendency to be hip while watching this film and allow yourself to be utterly carried away by one of the last opf the master-crafted films to come out of Hollywood, right on the threshold of Hollywood's decline into self-important, sneering mediocrity.  Julie Andrews is often castigated for her perennial goody-goody image, but watch carefully one the most stunningly lovely and frighteningly talented performers of the 20th century.  This is a historically fine performance caught on film that people in the 22nd century will still marvel at.  Eleanor Parker is no slouch either.Little known trivia - this movie literally saved 20th Century Fox Studiod from bankruptcy after the diastrous 21-million dollar flop Cleopatra(that's 1965 dollars).	5.0	Look for details you may have missed...	2004-03-29	7	7	0

I have to say that this is true.  The new version has a much cleaner picture with less noise and more vivid color than the previous one.  The language choices features an ""English 5.0 Surround"" track (no .1 subwoofer track, I guess, although this film doesn't need a lot of bass).  The previous version I own has 4.1 surround.  Add to that many more special features, and I think the 40th Anniversary Edition is one that you will want to add to your collection even if you already own another version of it.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A27UWBI2R985CM	Joseph M. Perorazio	"A beautiful restoration of a beautiful film.This latest incarnation of The Sound of Music offers the best-ever presentation of the best R&H; film adaptation, and one of the great film musicals of all time. The opening shots of the Austrian countryside have never looked more grand, and the outstanding lossless audio track presents the music in its full splendor, sounding every bit like a new movie and not a 40+ year old film.Robert Wise's choice of color palette for this film was rather muted, so there aren't really a lot of bright colors to show off, but the darks are superb (""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" is lovely) and the moonlit scenes on the Von Trapp veranda are just gorgeous now. This is without doubt the best this film has ever looked and sounded.Many of the special features from previous DVD releases have been incorporated into the blu-ray, but not all. Specifically, owners of the ""Five Star Collection"" should hang onto that edition (for the Charmain Carr documentary, among other features). I didn't bother with the deluxe box set (which features the ""My Favorite Things"" box; seemed a little too cliche), but no doubt true Sound of Music obsessives will want that edition as well.Very few musical films achieve both the artistic and cultural significance of The Sound of Music, and Fox has done themselves proud with this latest upgrade of one of the jewels in their crown."	5.0	Something good.	2011-01-06	2	1	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A240QB45BSMDAN	Josh P.	"Such golden moments in cinema history include the world-famous helicopter-shot zoom-in on Julie Andrews spinning joyfully around in the middle of an open green field, the orchestral music rising and Julie starting to sing those opening words in a closeup shot! Absolutely timeless! You know it's a classic already after the first 5 minutes with the long very played-out opening of wind-whistling, helicopter shots of mountains, valleys, lush towns below and the sweeping orchestral music. Same goes for the opening credits. Based on a true story, Julie Andrews is Maria, a young postulant that's just not cut out for convent life. She is sent to be the governess of seven children headed by their strict father Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). She re-introduces music to the Trapp household and brings forth the charm and merriment that they once knew, and works her charm on the Captain, too. As the children learn to sing, Uncle Max (Richard Haydn) finds that this is the great singing group he's been after to exploit to Salzburg, and the children, Maria and the Captain become the Von Trapp Family Singers. This wonderful, lavish story is set against the backdrop of the Nazi invasion of Austria and the Von Trapp's dodging the Nazis and escaping into Switzerland. I have first seen this film back when I was very small and loved every minute of it. Finally, I got this DVD recently and rediscovered all of its breathtaking beauty. It still hasn't grown old. I love the Spanish audio track, too, though no songs are dubbed in Spanish which isn't to speak of for the French audio track. The French female singer dubbing Julie Andrews' songs is actually kind of nice to listen to. There is also a commentary track by Robert Wise, the director with the isolated score; yes, you hear the score by itself with no talking or singing overtop of it. Good for music historians and appreciators. Everybody, no matter who they are, should see this film at least once in their lifetime for it is an all-time essential classic. Highly appealing to children as well as adults, ""The Sound of Music"" is one film that will always be treasured."	5.0	"""The hills are alive with the sound of music..."""	2005-04-30	4	4	0

The Sound of Music has a combination of wonderful cast (Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker, Charmian Carr etc., etc., etc.,) It also has stunning views of Austria and is one of the most romantic love stories.  I have seen many movies and musicals and not one of them inspired me like the Sound of Music.  The DVD is great with lots of extras just like the Five Star edition.  Its packaging is beautiful and the widescreen version of it is amazing.  The Sound of Music is a must for anyone that ever set foot on this planet.  This is not America's most loved and cherished film for no reason.  Everyone needs to see it at least once and I would strongly suggest buying this stunning classic.  R&H's last musical was their greatest.  The Sound of Music is packed with wonderful songs, everyone one of them classics, known around the world.  ""Edelweiss"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""So Long, Farewell"", ""Do-Re-Mi"", ""The Sound of Music""... these songs are all classics that will continue to bring a smile to chidren's and adult's faces for years to come.  There is something about it that just makes you smile and watch it over and over again.  The wonderful morals of love conquers all, and what trusting in God can do ring loud and clear. Whoever came up with the slogan ""The Happiest Sound in all the world,"" back in 1965 when the movie came out was definatly right.  This movie still is enormously popular even today and it proves that the Sound of Music clearly is still, and forever will be, ""The Happiest Sound in all the World!"""	5.0	The Happiest Sound in all the World...	2003-12-23	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2EIAFTUF35196	J. R. Stoddard	"This film was a big surprise for 20th Century Fox, which got a huge hit when something more modest was expected.  The people who made the film were amazed at it's popularity, but it is quite well made and well performed and isn't too sugary sweet.  I find it excellent family fare and they don't make that many good family films these days.  The filmmakers had to contend with a lot of rain when they were doing scenes around Salzburg, Austria.  In fact the opening of the film, when Julie Andrews is singing high in the mountains, was the only take when the sun came out!  Many of the other exterior shots were done under awnings with artificial light.I suppose its a matter of personal taste but Christopher Plummer can't stand talking about the film and refuses to be interviewed on the subject.  A few years back I was assigned to cover a press conference with Plummer when he was touring in a stage show and we received written notice that there were two things Plummer wouldn't discuss.  One was his daughter and the other was ""The Sound of Music"".  Any mention of either would signal the end of the interview, said the notice.  And that's such a shame because so many people love this movie and his performance in it.  He almost backed out of the film when he was told that Bill Lee would dub his singing voice.  Perhaps he is just tired of talking about it but I still enjoy his work as Captain von Trapp.  The children in the movie have all grown up and have children of their own but they will always be young in ""Sound of Music"".  Perhaps we all like being reminded of childhood...or the childhood we wish we had."	5.0	The Hills are alive with fans	2009-09-25	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A130UYD7PKHUGO	julieandrewsfan	This is a timeless tale of a novice nun named Maria (Julie Andrews) who is sent to be a governess for the seven von Trapp children. Their father, the autocratic widowed Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), is big on authority and discipline; he uses whistles to call them, has them line up by age, wear uniforms, etc. But the arrival of the freewheeling Maria changes all of that. She introduces spirit, fun, and best of all music back into the house. The true tearjerker is when the Captain joins his children in singing the title song to the Baroness (Eleanor Parker). She not only captures the hearts of his seven children, but ends up capturing the captain's heart as well. The attraction is immediate, but it's not until later in the movie that the attraction is realized with the breathtaking 'Laendler'. That does not, however, mean it's not present. Try the scene where Maria and the Captain are yelling at each other- can you say sexual tension? The impending Anschluss adds an element of danger to the story, and the acerbic Baroness keeps the story from being too sugary.I am a definite devotee of this film. Christopher Plummer makes a dashing Captain, Richard Haydn is an irreverent Max Dettweiler, and Eleanor Parker gives another splendid performance as the Baroness.But it's Julie Andrews who steals the show. She *is* Maria, wholly and completely. With her breathtaking voice and superb acting skills, she takes this glorious film to a whole new dimension. This film is without a doubt the best musical ever made.	5.0	Pure Magic	2005-07-25	5	5	0

And because we didn't have cable either, we watched this about 2.5 million times over.  I could probably write out the script of this movie while wearing a blindfold locked in a closet.... underwater.  Didn't this movie win some kinda award?  Well all I know is the music drives me insane.  2.5 million times is a lot to hear/see anything.  It IS a good movie and if you've never seen it before you really should, as it has some roots in true events.

The music, written by Rogers and Hammerstein is wonderful and people can be heard singing or humming along. Julie Andrews was incredible as Maria, a young woman torn between her feelings for the family where she served as governess and the convent she was determined to join. It's a movie the whole family can enjoy together. My family sings the songs when we are together, they lighten our hearts. I will never forget my first time seeing this movie in the theatre. I bet it would still draw a crowd if re-released. Five stars are not enough to rank this movie!

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1RHJDKOLDLWCY	"K. Bingham ""kirstieb"""	A cheerful, family classic starring Julie Andrews, there is a reason that this is one of the most beloved movies of all time.  With a wonderful, familiar score and breathtaking scenery, it lasts through many repeats.  Some of the costumes and hairstyles are out of date, as they were in the style of the 60's rather than the late 30s (the Baroness' wardrobe and styling were closer, but still off), but overall, it's a film that endures.	5.0	A cheerful family classic	2001-10-22	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3MY6GBWGZ1UY8	"K. Chung ""maui guy"""	The Sound of Music was an annual event in my family because it aired on TV once a year while I was growing up.  Even though I've seen the movie many  times, I just watched the DVD version and was amazed that I had either  forgotten or never &quot;heard&quot; some of the dialog before.The film  transfer and the re-done sound in dolby 4.1 is awesome (especially when you  consider I've seen the movie mostly on TV in mono!).  I haven't had a  chance to review the second DVD with all the extras yet, but you can bet I  will.What surprises me is that they've never re-done and re-released  The Sound of Music in the theatre.  I'm sure is would do well.  The wide  screen format onthe DVD is really great, so you can really see things that  were cut off in TV broadcasts.Buy it, you won't be disappointed.	5.0	A 'must have' for the collection	2000-08-31	1	1	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2J7P9HSLKC5Z7	KC shopper	This box set is wonderful!  You get the discs in a normal blu-ray case if you want to keep it somewhere else.  You also get a music box that's big enough to store a few pieces of jewelry or other small items.  There is a large book with pictures of the movie and behind the scenes info about the movie and the musical.  It also has some historical info about the real family that I thought was very interesting.  You get a smaller book and some individual pictures in a envelope.  If you are a fan of this movie, I highly recommend this set!  My children have had as much fun looking through it as I have.  They love that it is based on a real family and that they can read about that in the set.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AO461REE0KA4J	keviny01	This DVD is pretty much a duplicate of the 30th Anniversary laserdisc edition made in '95 which contained an extensive supplement section.  Considering the laserdisc cost $120, this DVD is an extremely good  deal.The movie is in widescreen format only.  Some of the extras include  an audio track carrying director's commentary alternating with  &quot;karaoke&quot; style music-only, no-singing track, the 1965 promo  documentary &quot;Salzburg Sights and Sound&quot; that runs 14 minutes, NOT  36 minutes as printed on the back of the DVD case, the 1995 re-release  promo documentary &quot;From Facts to Phenomenon&quot; that runs 86  minutes, and the extensive &quot;Gallery&quot; still-frame section that  details the making of the movie, including first-hand info such as  production memos, letters, telegrams written by the filmmakers themselves.  On nagging problem is that most of the still photos in the still-frame  section look too bright as if they were overexposed during development;  this problem didn't exist in the aforementioned laserdisc.The chapter  listing printed on the included booklet has most of the chapter numbers  printed incorrectly -- chapter 8 is misprinted as chapter 7, chapter 9 as  chapter 8, and so on throughout the entire chapter listing.  I use the  chapter menu on the disc more often than the printed chapter listing, so  this is not a big problem for me.DVD-ROM features include web links,  wallpapers, and a simple game where you guess the musical notes in a song.  Nothing groundbreaking here.This DVD is great for family viewing,  naturally.  And it's loaded with so much extra material that it will also  satisfy hardcore movie fans  who want to know more about the movie's  background, history, anecdotes, and so on.	5.0	Great DVD for family and movie buffs	2000-09-19	8	8	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3IBMF0HRWYAGQ	"Kienshin ""The Lone Wanderer"""	The Sound Of Music is one of the best musical dramas ever. Julie Andrews  as Maria is an extremely lovable character. The story is perfect and the  musics are memorable(not to mention the characters). And even though it has  aged considerably, it has never loose it's impact and still manage to be  warm and touching. There was never a single dull moment in the film. It  truly deserves the Academy Award for Best Picture. The picture quality on  DVD is so effectively remastered, you can be fooled into thinking it was  filmed last year. As for the sound, the Dolby Digital soundtrack is  incredible especially for a film  of this age. The making of documentary  covers the subject of the film and the real-life Maria with perfect detail.  And thanks to the isolated score i dont even need to get the soundtrack at  all. If you browse the disc carefully, you will find a lot of rare  materials inside. What more can i say? A near-perfect film on a  near-perfect DVD.

I was intrigued by the recent televised stage version and, though admittedly skeptical, I gave it a chance to charm me as the movie always has. To my chagrin, I found it was so badly scripted/rearranged (missing scenes, songs in wrong scenes...really?!?!) and poorly acted (Carrie Underwood is a fine singer, but not an actress), I gave up after an hour and found myself yearning for the original. So I ordered it in Blu-Ray. And what can I say? Simply spectacular!! Everything I remembered, as great as the first time...the music, singing and choreography incomparable...the acting stellar top to bottom...the story poignant and funny, endearing and suspenseful, romantic and heartwarming - in short, everything a timeless classic movie should be.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2GPEV42IO41CI	Kona	This is one of the best movie musicals of all time. It tells the true story of novice nun Maria, who is sent to be a nanny for a retired captain (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children. The captain is still sad over the loss of his wife, and distances himself from the kids. He becomes engaged to a snooty baroness (Eleanor Parker), who dislikes children and is especially jealous of the pretty, young novice. Maria is quite the singer, and in no time she has the kids, and their father, singing Austrian folksongs all over the countryside, and soon, she and the captain marry. The story takes a serious turn as Germany annexes Austria, and the captain is ordered to report for duty in Hitler's forces.Julie Andrews radiates confidence and joy in song after song, many of which have become familiar to everyone, especially Edelweiss, Doe, A Deer, and My Favorite Things. Her voice is pitch perfect and she looks great with Christopher Plummer. Salzburg is so beautiful, no wonder they sang all the time. This is a charming, romantic, and exciting musical the whole family will enjoy.	5.0	Follow Every Rainbow...	2002-06-15	1	1	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AGKPTMTR3UX1R	"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here"""	"THE SOUND OF MUSIC is incredibly entertaining and incredibly effective despite the fact that it is incredibly hokey. THE SOUND OF MUSIC may actually be the source of all known hokeyness in the universe. Still, despite it all, this film leaves nuclear waste long-haul truckers and oil-rig wildcatters singing, ""How do you solve a problem like Maria?"" with a smile on their grizzled faces.There's a lovely innocence to this film that touches everyone who sees it. Julie Andrews as Maria essentially reprises her MARY POPPINS role as the magical governess who brings happiness to a houseful of lonely children being raised by an overly stern but loving father.THE SOUND OF MUSIC is more or less the true story of the singing von Trapp family who fled anschluss Austria to escape the overwhelming shadow of Nazism. Christopher Plummer plays Naval Captain Georg von Trapp, a rather benevolent despot of a parent who is mismanaging his children with brisk military efficiency when Maria appears. The new Nanny is a reluctant Novice at the local convent, sent out into the world by the Reverend Mother to measure her devotion to the cloister. She soon falls in love with the children and they with her. As Maria and the children bond, the Captain and Maria are drawn to one another. They eventually marry, and as the Germans occupy their country, they flee over the mountains to Switzerland.Most of the musical numbers in THE SOUND OF MUSIC have become true standards, including, ""The Sound of Music,"" ""Sixteen on Seventeen,"" ""Do-Re-Mi"" (AKA ""Doe a Deer""), ""A Few of My Favorite Things,"" and ""Edelweiss"" (which is NOT the national anthem of Austria). Rodgers and Hammerstein contributed their best and last to the libretto. Musically, the 1965 movie varies somewhat from the 1959 stage play, but this only means there are more classics to be had in enjoying them both.Certain scenes have become classics in and of themselves: The opening scene of Julie Andrews flinging her arms and pirouetting joyfully on the slopes of the Unterberg is instantly recognizable. The chorus of smiling nuns is equally recognizable. The gazebo scene and gentle dance between the eldest daughter, Liesl and her boyfriend Rolf, still leaves the viewer with wet eyes. Plummer and Andrews' wistful last scene on stage in Salzbug is moving.Affection for this staid but singular film has led to it being often parodied (i.e., ""The Sound of Murder"") and picked on (viz., ""The Sound of Mucous""), and it is awfully easy to goof on the dialogue and songs, but nevertheless, we keep coming back to it.When released, THE SOUND OF MUSIC became the top-grossing film of all time, and, inflation adjusted, it still stands in the top ten. The continuing popularity of this film is amazing, especially considering that four decades later the movie musical is all but dead. There are no dramatic special effects, no car chases, no explosions, no T & A, and not a foul word in this film. No doubt, this combination of elements accounts for its success. The political yahoos who grow fat on trumpeting ""Family Values"" could do more good by encouraging people to watch this film than by all the other anti-whatever they hypocritically babble about. Of course, that assumes they really believe what they're saying in the first place.THE SOUND OF MUSIC is true G-Rated quality family entertainment, an artifact of a gentler age."	5.0	"""Fa, a long, long way to run...""

I admit that it can be quite the spoonful of sugar to take, but you still can't walk away feeling bad. I get chills the moment that the film opens. Having visited Salzburg (and yes I did take the SOM tour) it's as beautiful today as it ever was. Of course there are mistakes; for example the opening scene is not shot on the top of the Untersburg, but on the next mountain over and at the end the family is actually walking towards Germany instead of away, but who cares. It's beautifully filmed. The music is incredible and uplifting. The story is cute. The characters and enjoyable. It's one of those perfect films.	5.0	Absolutely Perfect	2001-06-21	2	1	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A14BTJRH9VNLJJ	Kurt A. Johnson	Young Maria (Julie Andrews) is training to be a nun. However, her exuberant nature leads her in very undignified directions. Knowing that she needs to be surer of her calling, Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) sends Maria to act as governess to the seven children of Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). While there, Maria guides Georg back to the love of his family, and comes to love him and his children herself. Throughout, Maria uses music to teach her wards and entertain. When the Anschluss (Nazi takeover of Austria) comes, she and the von Trapp family must escape the clutches of the Nazis. [Color, created in 1965, with a running time of 2 hours, 54 minutes.]This stirring musical is a treat for the whole family. It contains no violence or nudity, and is wonderful for its sympathetic treatment of religion, while it&#8217;s inclusion of Nazism is educational. Among the wonderful songs are The Sound of Music, Maria, My Favorite Things, So Long Farewell, and Climb Every Mountain. This is a great movie for the family, rightly considered a classic.	5.0	Stirring	2013-02-26	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1YGF9FFKQEB9N	L00king4nswers	This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I own the Widescreen version, but my mom doesn't like it. She hates the black bars on the top and bottom. I tried to explain to her that nowadays, they're doing Widescreen because they're including the left and right sides of the screen they previously cut off to fit the old square TVs. Now that TVs are becoming more wider, movies are being released on DVD in Widescreen format.My mom said she still wants to have the Full Screen version of this movie so that it fits the entire screen (without black bars). So I ordered a used copy of this! I have compared it with my Widescreen DVD and it DOES cut off the left and right side of the movie, as I assumed it would. But it does not make the DVD any less enjoyable. The quality is crisp and the sound is excellent. I'm really glad I own BOTH versions of this movie. The Sound of Music is my favorite and is the only movie I own both versions of.There's really no special features on it, except 1 commentary.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"As far as I am concerned there are two reasons to pick up ""The Sound of Music (40th Anniversary Edition)"" DVD is you already have the movie on DVD.  First, the movie has been digitally restored and if you look at the examples of the restoration on Disc 2 where they the right half of the frame has been cleaned up you can see that they really got the red out (seriously; the old version does not look so much washed out as it does rather reddish to me).  Consequently, the movie looks a lot better.  The change is not as thrilling as when I got to first see it in the letterbox format at home on the laser disc version and realized that on pan and scan we were missing literally half the picture (my kids still remember the shot where they could finally see the massive fountain on the left half of the scren), but if you really love this movie then you want a copy of the new print because the difference is so noticeable.Second, if the first reason is not strong enough, they have loaded up on extras for this DVD.  You have a commentary track by the late director Robert Wise and another with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Charmian Carr, choreographer Dee Dee Wood, and Johannes Von Trapp (the 10th and last of the Von Trapp kinder).  If you think listening to songs on the DVD is better than listening on the CD (I often find that to be the case), then you can play only the songs or play the songs with sing-a-long subtitles in three languages.  I especially liked the retrospective documentary ""A Few of My Favorite Things"" because it talks about the way the Broadway musical was turned into a Hollywood film by shifting songs and setting them up differently (see below).  The reminiscence by Andrews and Plummer is worthwhile as well and the ""Biography"" episode ""The Von Trapp Family: Harmony and Discord"" will certainly open your eyes to the ""true"" story behind it all.Watching the film again and learning about how the film was created from all of the DVD extras got me thinking about why this is the most popular movie musical of all time.  The first thing that works is that Robert Wise frontloads this movie big time.  We begin with the wonderful descent of the camera from the clouds until it finds Maria on top of the mountain, where she bursts into the title song and makes it clear that the beautiful vistas of Austria are integral to this film (it did for Salzburg, Austria what ""The Lord of the Rings"" did for New Zealand).  After the overture during the title credits we have the ""Preludium (Dixit Dominus),"" during which Wise presents us with some stunningly beautiful shots of nuns at prayer, establishing weight to the religious elements of the film.  Then when we get to ""Maria"" the Mother Superior and the rest of the nuns strike absolutely the right tone for singing a cute song while dressed in habits.  There is not a moment in this film where Peggy Wood's Mother Superior does not seem like an absolutely real person.  By the time Maria runs past them and does the big double take at having been caught, the film's first big joke, Wise has already established an extremely serious tone for a movie musical.What impresses me about this film is that if you take out the songs I think it still works as a drama and the only reason Julie Andrews did not win an Oscar for the best thing she ever did on film was that she had won the year before for playing the title role in the Dick Van Dyke film ""Mary Poppins"" (you have to be Katharine Hepburn not to overcome this sort of liability).  The only musical number that is in danger of going too far is the new ""I Have Confidence,"" but that is because Andrews plays it as bluster on Maria's part (e.g., the stumble on the last run).  Once we get past the opening of the movie where Wise so beautifully sets the stage for the film, the person who deserves a lot of the credit is screenwriter Ernest Lehman.  Pay attention to how he sets up the songs so that the seque from dialogue to singing is more naturalistic (""My Favorite Things"" is a prime example of this in the film).  Lehman's script also turned the Captain into a more of a fully developed human being than the martinet of the Broadway version.  Special mention also must be made of the poignant reprises of ""My Favorite Things"" when Maria returns, ""Maria"" during her walk down the ailse as the bride to be, and the high-brow ""Do-Re-Mi"" at the folk festival.Of course, if you have seen the show performed on stage you know that some of the songs have been put in different contexts.  For example, ""My Favorite Things"" was originally sung by Maria and the Mother Superior on stage and now becomes the song Maria sings with the kids to establish a report with them instead of ""Do Re Mi.""  That, of course, becomes the show piece of the film as Maria and the children tour Salzburg and the countryside singing, which gets us back to the wonderful scenery that Wise highlights from the opening moment of the film.  There are few Broadway musicals that have been transformed rather than ending up being merely translated when they are brought to the screen.  Some take advantage of more locations (e.g., ""Camelot,"" ""Evita""), but all things considered no musical has been upgraded on the big screen as much as ""The Sound of Music,"" which is why it remains on the top of the mountain forty years down the road."	5.0	A restored version with mondo extras of the best movie musical of all time	2005-12-15	17	16	1

The difference between this on DVD and this on Blu-Ray is absolutely amazing.  It truely is almost like seeing it for the first time, heck, a lot of stuff you ARE seeing for the first time!  I sympathize with the people who can't afford Blu-Ray, it is very expensive.  The players are now cheap, but the Hi-Def TV's you also have to have are NOT CHEAP AT ALL.  I watch Blu-Rays only on my Dell Studio XPS 1640 with it's 1080p screen.  That's the only thing I can afford right now.I hope some of the people who worked on this restoration Blu-Ray see this, my hat is off to you all, you did a beautiful job.

Amazon's digital copy is excellent.  Superb story follows the true story pretty faithfully.  Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are magnificent and believable playing Maria and Captain VonTrapp.  The brutality of the Nazis was implied well in a family friendly movie.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AD2BIAIH78QI5	"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal"""	"For years I was mad at ""The Sound of Music"" sight unseen because it outsold ""Gone with the Wind"" in tickets; even as a child I disliked change. But when we went to see it in a re-release, I was very excited by it. Over the years, my opinon changes: Sometimes I think Julie is too buffoonish and old for her role, most lately I think Christopher Plummer just walked through the picture. But I recognize that these opinions are like fads--they come and go, and the picture remains, great as it is.Of course, one must start with the score. Rogers and Hammerstein outdid themselves on this one, which is good since it was the last collaboration before Oscar died. How tragic if he had gone out after ""Pipeline"" or some other less worthy musical! Second, comes the beautful scenery of Salzburg itself. You know, whoever got the idea of that original tracking shot, where we fly over the Alps and ultimately zoom in on Julie twirling around was a genius--from that moment on, the picture was a guaranteed hit. If you ever listen to Mary Martin sing the title song on the original Broadway cast version, she does a nice quiet job of it. Well, not for these folks, no way! They went blockbuster with it, and nobody else who ever sings that song can ever attempt to do less than Julie does so well. The other shots as the children go round with their new governess through the gardens of Mirabel are just lovely.I think the supporting cast is particularly good: Peggy Wood as Reverend Mother is outstanding, singing or not. Richard Haydn as Max never fails to amuse me, and even Eleanor Parker as the Baroness is like an older, blonde Ava Gardner--very smooth but if you look too closely, I think she's kind of anorexic for her age. However, her beautiful wardrobe masks that very well.The children are good, though some must needs be forgettable I suppose, since there are so many of them--like the youngest boy and the girl before the youngest. But Angela Cartwright and Charmian Carr are excellent actresses both.Julie and Chris? Well, at the moment, I still find him a walk-through, detracting from most of the scenes he's in. I'm less annoyed with Julie these days. Of course, there's NO WAY I could ever fault her beautiful singing. I'd like to know why he was dubbed in, since the singer they hired to do his songs isn't so great. I guess it's funny that I can dislike the two main performances as much as I do, and still like this picture, but that's one of the mysteries of life, I guess. My only other criticism of the film is that I wish it were more colorful. Everything is somewhat white and gold and gray. Even the children's playclothes are a little washed out, color-wise. That's why I really notice that green dress Maria wears when she returns to the villa--it's the one vibrant color in the whole picture.Overall, though, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of the supreme movie musical achievements. Very few scores can better it, just about no singer can top Ms. Andrews. If you haven't seen this yet, what ARE you waiting for, an invitation to the convent itself?"	5.0	Not exactly MY favorite thing, but good notwithstanding	2002-09-16	3	1	2

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	The Sound of Music earned spot #55 on the AFI top listing, a list only a few musicals got into. How did this movie get onto a list with Gone with the Wind and The African Queen?Yes, the plot is a little simplistic. Evil nasty Nazis are threatening smiling beautiful children, and the family has to make a run for it. The children are not only photogenic but also have the voices of angels. Some of the lyrics are a little silly as well.Still, these are minor complaints in a moving story based on a real life adventure. The captain really did fall in love with his governess, the children really did have musical talent, and the threat of the Germans drove them to flee. It's great to see this true world tale brought to the big screen with such beauty.The scenes in Austria are just beautiful, from the elegant dances to the gorgeous landscapes. The movie really was filmed in Salzburg, Austria, and the exterior of the convent is the actual one the real Maria stayed in. You're getting an authentic world of the world these characters inhabited, although the house shown was not their real house.Julie Andrews is phenomenal. From her pure voice to the glow in her cheeks as she falls in love, she is an ideal heroine.Even more unusual, this movie actually passes the Bechdel test! The Mother Superior at the convent talks about how each of us has to follow our dreams, take on the challenges our life presents to us. Yes, in part it was about the captain, but it was about life in general, and she was talking about herself as much as Julie.A great movie well worth watching and rewatching for the pure joy of the story.	5.0	A must-own	2011-12-24	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"I resisted watching ""The Sound of Music"" for many years.  The plot sounded too sickly sweet to me.  Once I finally broke down and watched this movie from beginning to end, I realized that the movie was sickly sweet, but it was also so compelling and the songs were so catchy that it was impossible to resist this movie.  I know you just can not wait to hear me tell you whether you should have this movie in your collection, so I will tell you now that you should.This movie initially centers on Maria, played by Julie Andrews in one of her first film roles.  Maria is a novitiate at an Abbey in Austria.  Though Maria is earnest, being a nun seems a poor fit with Maria's outgoing and gregarious personality.  The Mother Abbess, played by Peggy Wood in one of the final roles of her career, wisely decides that Maria needs a different perspective on life before facing the decision to take her vows.  The Mother Abbess sends Maria to the Von Trapp family to be the children's governess.We quickly discover that Captain Von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, is a strict disciplinarian.  We immediately see the primary conflict in this movie, one which can only lead to love and marriage as the two dominant personalities recognize that they need the strength of each other to survive in the world.  However, before we get to the excitement that happens later in the movie, Maria needs to remind Captain Von Trapp that families are not armies, and that children need love, not marching and saluting.In the background of the main story is Nazi Germany's ambition of empire that led to the Anschluss or annexation of Austria into Greater Germany.  Captain Von Trapp was a strong Austrian nationalist and was very opposed to the Anschluss.  World events and Nazi Germany's insistence that Captain Von Trapp become a part of the German navy soon overshadow the honeymoon of Maria and Captain Von Trapp.  The end of this movie must count as one of the most awe-inspiring endings ever filmed in a musical.Every scene with Julie Andrews is a treat.  Andrews lights up the screen with her presence and her singing, fully justifying the Academy Award nomination she received for best actress in 1966 and the awards she won from BAFTA, the Golden Globes, and the Laurel Awards.  Andrews' four octave singing voice is the vocal anchor that provides the basis for many of the charming and frequently beautiful songs.  The songs range from soaring to sweet and catchy.  Among these songs are ""Edelweiss,"" ""The Lonely Goatherd,"" ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Do-Re-Mi"" and the title song.Though Julie Andrews was certainly a powerful force in this movie, the other stars helped complement Andrews' considerable talents.  Christopher Plummer was outstanding as Captain Von Trapp, though he looks back on his role in this movie with distaste.  The children were outstanding, and did an excellent job of singing and acting.  Some of the children have gone on to extensive acting careers, others left acting after only this movie or a few roles to other activities.  Eleanor Parker was awesome as Baroness Schraeder, the woman we all loved to hate because she came between Maria and the Children and the Captain.I will provide a brief word about the sound and the picture.  I thought the sound was excellent, but I only have a 50"" television with stereo speakers.  I do not have surround sound connected.  The sound was very good though I have some issues with lower frequency reproduction (I guess I need a subwoofer).  I have a bigger issue with picture quality.  The color keeps shifting between scenes.  In some scenes the color is excellent.  In other scenes, the color seems off.  At first I thought something was wrong with my television, but I checked the quality of the picture against other inputs and realized that the problem was the DVD itself.  The color shifts are often subtle, but in a few places they are annoying.  I hope future releases have this problem fixed.This movie routinely makes top ten lists of the greatest musicals, as well it should.  This movie may fall short of being a perfect movie, but I am unable to suggest how it could have been any better.  I have watched multiple releases of this movie multiple times and regardless of the quality of the release, I watch each time almost as though I had never seen the movie before.  You must have this movie in your collection, especially if you are a romantic at heart or have a family.Enjoy!"	5.0	Wonderful Musical	2007-10-07	3	3	0

Slaughter ""silvanus"""	Oh sure, there are moments that Post-Moderns will rate as camp and kitsch, but the overall effect of this lively musical can lift even the most  cynical urbanites.  Maria, The Captain and the troupe evidence the best in  human nature, and director Wise - no slouch - vividly paints a sylvan,  civilized world threatened by the barbarism of encroaching Nazis and  Fascists.  Who can knock Maria's wonderful spunk and enthusiasm for living  and loving, or the Captain's hard shell as Maria deftly melts it?  Yeah,  it's corny and sucrose in parts - musicals rarely skirt sentimentality -  but it's wonderful family entertainment, and a lyrical illustration of  'where the day can take you' if you have the courage to listen to your  heart.  Young Love was never so sweet as &quot;Sixteen Going on  Seventeen&quot;.

Well, that was me, today. I had seen bits and pieces, of course, and had obviously heard the classic songs (who hadn't, right?). But I just finished watching the movie in its entirety (it lasts close to three hours) for the first time ever, and it truly is as magnificent as everyone said it was.The story is simple, yet powerful: a story of search, love and struggle, starring Julie Andrews playing Maria, a woman who leaves an Austrian convent to assist Captain Georg von Trapp (Michael Plummer), a widower Navy officer with the upbringing of his seven children. The acting of the adults and the children actors is impeccable and the music is so ingrained into the story that one is impossible to conceive without the other, yet it hardly feels like a musical.""The Sound of Music"" has got to be without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen in my life and a story I will hold dear to my heart."	5.0	Magnificent!

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2ULSA0IRUE09E	Marc Cabir Davis	I bought this DVD the other day thinking that I would finally have in my possession my favorite childhood musical. While that wish partially came true, I must alert buyers that this DVD, while no doubt excellent, is not the classic that its being touted as. I, for one, am waiting for a more definitive version of the DVD to come out.The main problem with this is that the movie here is available ONLY on widescreen. While this is much preferred to certain audiences, I would much rather have the option of watching it on full-screen. I found myself squinting at the screen on occasion (and I have a large television, mind you) just to catch the details. Disc One was a complete letdown due to this. Also, and I'm not the first to say this, the color transfer is wretched. One would think that for this price you'd get an impeccable transfer, and this version leaves much to be desired.Disc Two is the real scene stealer. The easily navigable and user friendly format is appreciated, as is the 87 minute long documentary. Luckily the documentary has some scenes of the movie presented in full-screen, so that was a relief.All in all, this version of the DVD is not entirely satisfactory. In fact, after watching the movie on widescreen, I actually wondered if I should have bought this on VHS. And that really speaks volumes for the qaulity of this Disc. I fail to understand the multitude of reviewers who have heaped praise upon these two discs. To love the movie is one thing, but I do not believe that they love the way its been reproduced here. Highly disappointing, and not really recommended to DVD lovers who know their digital discs.	4.0	Widescreen Woes	2001-01-22	12	10	2

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1D90MKRWB0ZKP	March boy	Academy Award nominations: Leading Actress-Julie Andrews, Supporting Actress-Peggy Wood, Cinematography, Costume Design and Set Design.Wins: Picture, Director-Robert Wise, Film Editing, Scoring of a Dramatic Picture and Sound Mixing.March Boy awards: Picture, Director-Robert Wise, Leading Actress-Julie Andrews, Leading Actor-Christopher Plummer, cinematography, Film Editing, Scoring of a Dramatic Picture, Costume Design, Set Design, Sound Mixing and Song--&#34;Climb Every Mountain.&#34;Despite all the put-downs The Sound of Music has received over the years (it was too long, boring, sickly irritatingly sweet, sentimental, saccharine, treacle, corny, etc.) I sincerely believe it is one of the finest musicals ever made. All the performances are pitch perfect, the main characters are full three-dimensional people, the screenplay has dialogue crackling with wit, humor and spark and every song has a simple, sweet, endearing melody. And obviously, critical opinion didn't matter to the Academy because they did award it Best Motion Picture and Director.What I don't understand is how a movie can win awards for Motion Picture and Director and none for the acting. (Lawrence of Arabia and The Return of the King are other examples.) I mean, direction is all about bringing out the best in your actors, how you envision every scene and a Picture nomination means the movie as a whole (cinematography, sets, costumes, music, directing, screenwriting AND acting.)I wish Julie Andrews had won an Academy award for Maria instead of Mary Poppins because she got to play a more complex role; she showed that she could do more than just sing and dance. One thing I love about her performance is that she doesn't try to make Maria into a plastic saint or a goody-goody. She is stubborn, strong-willed, outspoken and sometimes prone to kooky antics. What makes her such an endearing character is how she devotes herself to the children and helps the Captain understand that he should love and cherish them while their still young. Her crystal clear voice (speaking too) is always a pleasure to the ears. Every note is like a delicate glass bell and her superb diction makes every song sound like she is telling a poem.Christopher Plummer gives an excellent performance as the cold, sarcastic, stern father who slowly softens up and learns to appreciate the joys of family life again. I love the way the screenplay treats the relationship between him and Maria and even though you know it&#8217;s going to end in romance it develops so slowly and gradually that it feels real.Eleanor Parker plays Baroness Elsa with just the right amount of regalness and gentility. She could easily have been the villain of the piece--Maria's rival--but instead she wisely underplays her inner tensions of jealousy. Elsa tries to get rid of Maria but when Maria comes back she can tell that the captain and her truly love each other and fit together perfectly. She understands and wants them to be happy so she gracefully breaks off her engagement. Robert Wise wisely (no pun intended) cut Elsa&#8217;s songs from the score to help emphasize that Maria fits in with the family better.Peggy Wood gained a Supporting Actress nomination for her role as the Mother Abbess and while she does not quite exceed the greatness of Shelley Winters as the evil mother in A Patch of Blue (the winner that year) she plays her part with a strong sense of piety and devotion. All the child actors fit their roles like gloves, especially Charmian Carr as Liesel.Robert Wise's direction is flawless. He brings out the best in every actor and stages every sequence perfectly. I especially admired how he quickly made the transition from whimsical and light-hearted throughout most of the movie to the intense and suspenseful last fifteen minutes in the Abbey, especially the cemetery sequence.The cinematography contains soft pastel shades of earth and flesh tones--sepia, brown, gray, green, blue and white. The costumes and sets are detailed enough and never look cheap or cheesy.Five stars? You better believe it.	5.0	Call me crazy but I love this film!	2013-12-22	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1JLH6T4WAOPHY	Marc Musnick	"My parents dragged me to this musical when I was 8.  Hated it.  I saw the movie in first release, got bored and left an hour into it.With age one begins to appreciate the sweeter things about life, things that are decent and show people at their best and after watching bits and pieces of the movie on tv over the years and having always loved Julie Andrews, I decided during a real bad funk a few weeks ago, to buy the 40th Anniversary Edition.  It was really like discovering it for the first time.  Actually it turned into the first time I watched the film in its entirety.  I love Rodgers & Hammerstein's musicals (all of them really pathed the way for the ""serious"" American musical) and this one is really far more endearing in retrospect than I had remembered.  For one thing the story, which really has little to do with the real story of the Von Trapp Singers, is very moving, uplifting and even spiritual.  It really is a story about personal triumph, the importance of honor and brotherhood and courage and there's certainly nothing wrong with the beautiful music.THE SOUND OF MUSIC has very little nostalgic ties for me so the Sing Along documentary was a hoot for me.

It is about a woman named Maria(Julia Andrews) and she is a not-so good novice nun in the Abbey. The Reverend Mother then sends her to Salzburg since a motherless Von Trap family needed a governess to take care of its seven children. (wow!) The Captain(Christopher Plummer) is very strict and it's up to Maria to brighten the family up. It ends with the family in danger from the Nazi as they flee from Austria.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	"Maria (Julie Andrews) is an apprentice nun.  She truly wants to devote her life to God, but struggles with the rules.  When the Mother Abbess sends her to take care of Captain von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) children, she gets more then she bargained for.  The children are in desperate need of love, and she and the captain begin to fall in love as well.  Meanwhile, Austria is in danger from the advancing Nazi threat.""The Sound of Music"" is one of those feel good films.  I smile the entire way through it.  In my mind, it's Rogers and Hammerstein's best musical.  All the songs are easily singable and memorable.  Who doesn't know ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Do-Re-Mi,"" or even the title song?  Yet these songs are set into a fun love story against an interesting back drop.  The movie does loose a little steam in the second act, but my only real disappointment is the cutting of two songs from the play.  ""How Can Love Survive?"" and ""No Way to Stop It"" add some fun and help flesh out the character of the Baroness.  In spite of these things, I still love the movie version, however.The two disc set is a wonderful way to own this classic movie.  The picture and sound are wonderful, and the disc is packed with information.  I especially enjoyed the documentary on the second disc because it includes information on the real von Trapps.If you haven't seen this classic piece of American cinema, don't hesitate.  If you're looking for the perfect disc to own, this is it.  It may be harder to track down the two disc edition, but in my mind, it's well worth it."	5.0	Wonderful Presentation of a Classic	2003-02-04	1	1	0

Does not live up to the standards set by other classic film HD upgrades (Wizard of OZ 75th anniversary edition or Willy Wonka's box set are good examples of how it should be done).The extras in the box are pretty cool though and overall I do not regret the purchase just surprised at the HD conversion itself.	3.0	Hmmmm	2013-12-17	3	2	1

We don't have a Blu-ray player yet, but others in our family do. The combo works well for all players. We had absolutely no problem with the DVD and we enjoyed this classic musical without issue.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2VT9F6XVJS81C	Mark Riddle	All I can say is WOW!  The picture and sound quality of this release are breathtaking.  Right from the first opening scene where Julie Andrews is  twirling on the mountain top as the camera moves in, you can actually make out tiny yellow and pink flowers in the grass!!!  The images are so sharp that the actual grain of the film can be seen.  This really makes you feel as though you are watching a film and not a video transfer.  I own several versions of this film (VHS, DVD & the old Laser Disc) and I can say this is a major leap forward.  The extras on disc two are quite nice.  I really enjoyed the bits about the technical aspect of restoring the film for hi def. I wished they had longer segments on that.I did read the very few 1 star comments, most of which were from people who had yet to purchase the product.  It DOES indeed come with DVD and Blu Ray--this seems to be confusing people.  It comes with both.  Also someone posted being disappointed in the picture quality.  This is confusing as I wonder if this person actually watched it on a hi def TV or, like a friend of mine, was confused and not hooked up his blu ray player and HDTV using a HDMI cable?  I wonder. Either way, the film is amazing to look at in this format.  A large thanks to the talented people who restored such a precious piece of our cinema history.	5.0	The Hills Are Alive	2010-11-29	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AAYE34TCTNV2R	MarlowesMom	"This review is from ""Sing Along Sound of Music"" at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco. The title song is the source of the infamous ""like a lark that is learning to pray"" lyric. Now here is our plot.Maria, our heroine, is a postulate at a convent in Salzburg, Austria in the late 1930s. Her faith is genuine, but she's really too much of a free spirit to fit into the quiet, orderly ways of the nuns. The Mother Superior sends Maria and her guitar to serve as governess to the seven children of widower Captain Georg von Trapp, late of the Austro-Hungarian Imperial Navy. Maria is appalled at the Captain's cold, militaristic interactions with his children. The Captain wants no singing, laughter or fun in his house as they remind him of his late wife. His children wear uniforms (except when they're dressed formally for their butler-served dinners), march, and respond to coded whistles. The Captain goes to Vienna to see his girlfriend, the elegant Baroness Schrader. While he's away, Maria, quite the hand with her needle stretching her available yardage to fit 7 kids,  makes the children play clothes out of her old curtains. Wearing their green and white, vaguely floral pinafores and lederhosen, they skip through the scenic beauty of Salzburg, picnic, climb trees, row a boat in the lake, and sing, sing, sing. The Captain returns, Baroness in tow, sooner than expected. He is first appalled but slowly delighted at the change Maria has wrought in his family, and is even persuaded to sing ""Edelweiss"" accompanying himself on the guitar. By the way ""Edelweiss"" is NOT a traditional patriotic song of Austria, but another of the Rodgers & Hammerstein songs composed for the musical. After some shenanigans with the Baroness who is not really fond of children, and a subplot about a telegraph boy named Rolf who is enamored with eldest Von Trapp daughter Leisl but even more enamored of the Nazis, the Captain realizes he is in love with Maria and sends the Baroness packing. Meanwhile, the Captain's friend, Max Detweiler, is plotting to get the Captain to allow his talented family to sing in the Salzburg Folk Festival, and the Nazis annex Austria to Germany and ""invite"" the Captain to accept a commission in the German navy. The Captain and Maria marry. Of course the Austrian patriot Captain von Trapp cannot accept the German naval commission. With Max's assistance, the family uses their exit from the stage at the folk festival to escape the Nazis by ""driving into the mountains"" and walking over the Alps to neutral Switzerland singing ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain.""The movie takes some rather large liberties with the facts. In real life, Maria went to be a tutor to one of the Captain's children, not governess to all seven. The Captain was a perfectly pleasant fellow. There was no ""Baroness"" rival for the Captain's affections. No junior Nazi was romancing Leisl. Maria and the Captain were married for several years before they left Austria. The Trapp Family emigrated not by walking over the mountains to Switzerland with seven children plus luggage (the Swiss border is hundreds of miles from Salzburg), but by catching a train to Italy.For someone who's been cloistered in a convent, Maria has an awful lot of wisdom about children and family life. The Captain's conversion from bitter widower to loving papa takes place implausibly quickly. The children are all too sweet for words, and most of the songs are so sweet they make your teeth ache. So why five stars?Appalling sentimentality, I suppose. There's something irresistibly innocent and charming about the proceedings. Sitting in the dark theatre, singing along with hundreds of strangers from age 1 to 99, straight, gay and everything in between, knowing every familiar melody by heart, thinking of my long-dead grandfather who loved this movie after spending his life on the flat midwestern prairies and the dry Arizona desert . . . happy tears poured down my face during every song. How can I NOT give 5 stars?"	5.0	It's Scmaltz, But It's Really GOOD Schmaltz	2011-12-07	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3AM47VJNSKWZR	marriagecoach1	In my view, The Sound of Music could arguably be the film of the century or even the greatest film ever made.With wonderful panoramas in the Austrian Alps, good versus evil and wonderful music and story line and spoton cinematography.  All the acting is first rate and believable and what is better that it is a true story.I remember it with fond memories as my first ever boy girl date.  What is even more remarkable, in the citywhere I lived the movie played for over a year in the same theatre.  I know of no other movie with that kindof legs and people are still watching 45 years later.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A271BZCXSXD1LW	"Mary A. Faderan ""garden girl"""	When I first watched this movie, I was so impressed with Julie Andrews' voice that I sang all the songs at school to whomever would listen to me and then asked them whether or not I, too, sounded like Julie Andrews! My unimpressed classmates did not deter me from swooning at this movie every time I watch it. Watching this movie never disappoints me, and gives me a cheerful spirit especially during the holidays when our local stations put it on to keep the small fry settled after Christmas meal.  Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews' &quot;pas de deux&quot; scene is so romantic. Because this story is based on a real live woman of God makes Maria Von Trapp even more inspiring. The scenes of Austria and the mountains are wonderful, the music is inspired, and the interactions Maria has with her religious superiors refreshingly true. The evil that is symbolized by the Nazi atmosphere is neutralized by Maria's goodness, and brings to fruition the family's successful escape from Austria. One can also see how the Captain's haughty attitude (as reflected in part by his ton-y artistic friend and his fiancee, played by Eleanor Parker) melts under the simplicity and candor that is Maria. The  Captain's duty to his call to arms (to an evil Fuhrer) naturally yields to the stronger call to love of Maria and for his family. This, to me, gives depth to this movie that seems to have no real peer in the genre. The acting is superb, the sets are gorgeous and the musical scenes are charming.  It is Julie Andrews'and Christopher Plummer's most memorable work and it needs to be always included in the classics of all time.	5.0	Wishful	2000-11-08	2	1	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2JW3TQHLTTSFO	Mary E. Evans aka Maryee	"I am 33 years old and am African-American.  As a child, my three siblings and I watched the Sound of Music year after year after year.  We learned and sang along to ALL of the songs, knew the children's names, demeanors, as well as anticipated the entire plot unfolding each time it aired on TV.  My mother loved music, movies, comedy and fun.  If the Sound of Music was considered a ""baby-sitter"" back then to her, then she hired the right lady in Julie Andrews and the cast.  We would sit quietly and intently watching the movie only to make noise when called for (singing, laughing, and crying).As an adult, the love for this movie has never changed.  Julie Andrews' role as Maria led us to embrace life through sharing in her joys, fears, hopes, innocense, sorrows, and her journey to find out what really mattered in life in this movie.It is truly a classic that ALL people should watch, share with family, friends and of course their children.  When I have kids of my own, the classic edition will be one of their ""baby sitters"", and hopefully it will bridge a gap in communicating how life can show you many things about yourself and others.My sister and I introduced the soundtrack to our nephew at the age of 6.  He's 13 years old and was watching the movie on TV when it last aired a few months ago.  He loves the songs and I am sure, as it ""stuck"" to us, it has taken the same meaning to him.  I would encourage you to buy the video, DVD and soundtrack.  They are truly collectors items.  You will not be disappointed."	5.0	A Classic for ALL people!	2003-11-03	8	8	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2R6RA8FRBS608	Matthew G. Sherwin	"It's very hard to know where to begin when praising both this movie as well as the double ""digi-pack"" DVD of it. Julie Andrews gives a very strong performance as Maria, a misfit nun who is turned out into the world by the Reverand Mother to see if she really wants to be a nun. Her singing range of  4 octaves is beautifully displayed at the end of the song ""Do-Re-Mi."" Christopher Plummer is well cast as the Captain von Trapp who is not too likeable--yet is charmed into being a man again be Maria's infectious inner and outer beauty. The rest of the cast is well chosen and the viewer is treated to a rare screen performance by Marni Nixon; Marni dubbed vocals for Deborah Kerr in The King and I and she did dubbing for My Fair Lady and South Pacific as well. The second disc contains two fantastic documentaries about Salzburg, the city in Austria where many scenes were filmed, as well as the production and history of the film. The history of the real-life von Trapp family on whom the story is based is well laid out with revealing interviews from family members themselves. In addition, the cinematography is superlative. Very honestly, I cried at the end of the film and I NEVER cry--it's THAT touching! This is NOT a film to be sneered at as being sugary sweet. It's a classic tale of good triumphing over evil as the von Trapp family flees Austria to escape the Nazis.(...)"	5.0	One of the greatest movies of all time!	2004-06-06	7	6	1

This is a masterpiece of the American musical beautifully adapted to the screen.The casting is excellent, from Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer in the starring roles, to the children, each of whom has a distinct personality and screen presence, to the nuns, headed by the lovely Peggy Wood (and including an on-screen appearance by Marni Nixon who supplied the singing voice for Natalie Wood, Audrey Hepburn, and Deborah Kerr to name but three), to Eleanor Parket and Richard Hayden in the supporting roles.  The scenery is gorgeous from the first aerial view of the mountains to the last and the interiors, particularly those in the Von Trapp house, are sumptious.Since most viewers have already seen this movie either in the theatre, on TV, or in video-format (either commercial or taped from TV) or perhaps on LaserDisc, the real question is, &quot;Do I need the DVD version?&quot;In the case, the answer is yes.  The extra offerings are interesting and help increase the viewers enjoyment of the movie, plus, they are full of bits of useful (or is that useless?) trivia.  OK, now let's all watch once more to find the real Maria von Trapp in the crowd...As with most DVD's the real advantage is being able to cue a particular scene for those times when you don't want to watch the entire movie -- no more guessing and backing-up.So, unless you are just toooo cultured to enjoy this classic musical, consider adding this DVD to your library, or, better yet, give it to a young person who has yet to be introduced to &quot;the hills are alive....&quot;	5.0	Great format for a classic Hollywood musical	2001-12-07	1	1	0

Mind you, this is not an accurate biography of the Von Trapp family - the real Maria was nowhere near as lovely or sweet as Julie Andrews, but this movie is a entertaining story nonetheless with some pretty awesome musical numbers.Julie Andrews really shines in her role as young Maria as she goes to become a governess for the Von Trapps. Her sweet asnd steadfast personality allow her to remain cool under the pranks that the Von Trapp children play jokes on her (they even feel bad for it!) and how she eventually gets through to the patriarch of the Von Trapps himself. Set amidst pre World-War Europe (namely Austria), this is a lovely if somewhat fictionalized account of the Von Trapps.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AMC537PXPF5EQ	Medard G. Ylagan	The Sound of Music is a classic musical set amid the splendor and majesty of the Bavarian Alps. Shot in Salzburg, I consider it as one of the greatest screen musical ever made.The film is based on a real family and their true events. It tells the story of a young postulate, Maria, who after proving too high-spirited for the Mother Abess and other nuns, is sent off to work as a governess to seven unruly children. The von Trapp family is run in military style, by the seemingly cold-hearted Captain von Trapp, a lonely widowed naval officer.  Seeing how badly he and his children need companionship, he proposes to Baroness Schraeder, calculating, mutual friend of beloved family friend Max Detweiler.  It is the baroness who soon realizes that it's Maria - with her warmth and love for the children, whom the captain really loves.  It is nearly bliss for the newly formed family who loves to sing together except for the cloud looming over their beloved Austrian horizon: Hitler is ascending to power, forcing von Trapp to decide whether to join the Nazi party, which he loathes or force his family to leave their home forever.The musical is trying to depict the political crisis of Austria wherein the country was so much affected with the arising power of the Nazis that time.  This musical is really one of my favorites.  With the beautiful cinematography, along with the beautiful songs, no doubt it deserves the Academy Awards it had.I strongly recommend this musical to everyone especially those who love music very much. It is really quite a splended film for me since i also love the classics. The dvd format is great!!!	5.0	...taming von Trapp Family	2001-10-16	4	4	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	There was really no need for another release, and I hope I'm not the only one who's getting sick of stupid re-releases of DVDs already out, with just one extra bit on them. It's not necessary. Apart from this, I've already seen a 15th anniversary edition of Pretty Woman, fabulous, unless you already own the 10th anniversary edition.Much as I love this film, if you already own the previous DVD, then there's no point buying this. If you haven't seen the film, or haven't bought the DVD already, maybe thinking about buying it for a member of your family, for Christmas, then sure, go for it.OK, there's a few more extras on this, than the previous release. On this one, you have: commentaries by director Robert Wise, Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Charmian Carr, choreographer Dee Dee Wood, and Johannes Von Trapp; introduction by Julie Andrews on both discs; separate chapter list for songs only with Play All feature; English, French, and Spanish sing-a-long subtitles; A Few of My Favorite Things: A retrospective documentary; Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer: A Reminiscence; Charmian Carr on location with The Sound of Music from Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion; When You Know the Notes to Sing: A Sing-Along Phenomenon; Biography: The Von Trapp Family--Harmony and Discord; Restoration comparison; storyboard gallery; behind-the-scenes stills; lobby cards and one-sheets; screen test: Mia Farrow; and Trailers and TV spots: Theatrical teaser, Theatrical trailer, 1st Anniversary trailer, Academy Award trailer, 1973 reissue trailer, testimonial trailer, TV trailer.On the old edition you have: Original 1965 documentary Salzburg Sight and Sound (14 minutes); making of documentary The Sound of Music: From Fact to Phenomenon with cast interviews, rare music outtakes, photos and more! (87 minutes); audio supplement by Ernest Lehman; audio Interviews with Julie Andrews and Robert Wise; DVD-ROM games and links to fan site; storyboards, sketches, production stills and theatrical trailers, radio and TV spots.OK, so there's more on the new release, but do you really want to pay for it, when you're probably not that interested in watching the extras? I wouldn't. And as for the singalong bit, with the words going across the bottom of the screen, if you've seen the film enough times, then you'll already know the words off by heart! Or is that just me!I suggest you only buy this if you haven't already got the DVD. If you have, there's really no point.	4.0	Why another release of this?	2005-11-28	14	5	9

While the movie sometimes gets a ribbing for it's too sweet of a story, things aren't always rosy as the family encounters the Nazis. Anyway, Twentieth Century Fox ""climbed every mountain, followed every rainbow"" and created the two-disc 40th Anniversary Edition DVD of the Oscar-winning film South of Music. The cast reunites for the first time in 20 years to celebrate and share memories, old and new.Julie Andrews hosts the DVD that contains new documentary material that includes a conversation with Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Andrews talks about the von Trapp family and how their story made it to Broadway and Hollywood. Johannes von Trapp, Plummer, Charmian Carr (Liesl), Wise and others join her. Travel to Salzburg with Carr to see the movie's locales.You can view the film in two ways - the fully-restored original theatrical feature and an interactive version with a sing-along feature so viewers can watch, listen, and sing-along. The sing-along has subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. The movie comes in widescreen format with surround sound capabilities.Also included on DVD is a storyboard gallery, a comparison of the restored film, stills from behind-the-scenes, and trailers. Can you imagine Mia Farrow in the role of Maria? Her screen test brings the imagining to life.The movie is loosely based on the von Trapp family - the documentaries talk about the real family and the differences from the movie. For one, Maria was the strict one, not the Captain. Those interested in such facts get the details.The movie opens with Andrews' introduction and you can watch it while listening to commentary from the original laserdisc by producer and directory Robert Wise. One caveat - and this is common with most DVDs - the extras are not captioned, only the movie and sing-along. Disc two with most of the extras runs for 203 minutes.Once having viewed the two discs, few walk away with unanswered questions as it's a thorough piece of work. For those who have an earlier version of the DVD, the extras come with plenty of material not found on the previous releases. However, if you're not into the facts, behind-the-scenes visits, and the people who made the movie; then you won't miss much. South of Music is superb example of what should come on DVD with extras."	4.0	The movie, updates on the actors, and traveling behind-the-scenes	2005-12-13	8	7	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"Following the success of the 1964 film ""Mary Poppins"", Julie Andrews starred in another sensational film only one year later, ""The Sound of Music"".  Directed by Robert Wise (who also directed ""The Andromeda Strain"" in 1971, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" in 1951 and ""West Side Story"" in 1961), the film was derived from the Broadway musical created by Richard Rogers & Oscar Hammerstein II, in corroboration with writers Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse).  It was based upon the true story of the van Trapp family immediately prior to World War II.Taking place in Salzburg, Austria in 1938, the film begins with a cinematically beautiful display of the Alps and Julie Andrews singing the title song.  Julie Andrews plays Maria, a young woman studying to become a nun; but Reverend Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) along with nuns Sister Margaretta (Anna Lee), Sister Bertha (Portia Nelson), Sister Sophia (Marni Nixon) and Sister Bernice (Evadne Baker) aren't sure whether Maria is suitable nun material.  Mother Abbess decides to send Maria on a mission to be a governess to the seven children of Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a decorated hero of the Austrian Navy.  Captain von Trapp has had great difficulty finding a proper governess for his children, who frequently discourage any governess from remaining by using various pranks.  Initially, the children intend to treat Maria as any previous governess, but they quickly take a liking to her.  Upon discovering that the children have never sung before, Maria teaches them how to sing, to the unintended delight of Captain von Trapp's friend, Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn), who is searching for fresh musical talent.  However, Captain von Trapp does not intend to allow Max to exploit his children's previously unknown musical abilities.  Further, unexpected feelings develop between Captain von Trapp and Maria.Complicating matters for Maria and the von Trapp family is the political atmosphere in 1938 Austria.  Some Austrians enthusiastically embrace the idea of Anschluss (political annexation) between Austria and Nazi Germany, but most (including Captain von Trapp) are totally opposed.  As history records, Nazi Germany takes control of Austria in 1938, and Germany's naval command wants Captain von Trapp to take command of one of its naval vessels.  Captain von Trapp instead decides to take his family to the safety of Switzerland.Acting and singing in ""The Sound of Music"" are superb. Not only the abilities Julie Andrews (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress) eloquently showcased, but also those of Christopher Plummer and Peggy Wood (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress).  The young actors & actresses portraying Captain von Trapp's children are also very talented: Leisl (Charmian Carr), Louisa (Heather Menzies, who played Jessica in the 1977 TV series ""Logun's Run""), Friedrich (Nicholas Hammand, who acted in many TV series including ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" as Spider-Man in 1978), Kurt (Duane Chase), Brigitta (Angela Cartwright, who also played Penny in the 1965 TV series ""Lost in Space""), Marta (Debbie Turner) and Gretl (Kym Karath. who also played Maggie in the 1963 film ""The Thrill Of It All"").  Also putting in wonderful performances are Eleanor Parker as the Baroness, Ben Wright as Herr Zeller and Daniel Truhitte as Rolfe.Songs from the film include:* ""The Sound of Music"" (5+/5, Julie Andrews). Overlooking the Alps.* ""Preludium (Dixit Dominus)"" (4.5/5, nun's chorus).  At the abbey.* ""Morning Hymn/Alleluia"" (4.5/5, nun's chorus).

At the abbey.* ""Something Good"" (4.5/5, Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer).  Outside.* ""Processional/Maria"" (4.5/5, nun's chorus).  Maria's wedding to Captain von Trapp at the abbey.* ""Edelweiss"", (5/5, Christopher Plummer, Julie Andrews, children & audience.)

Crossing the Alps into Switzerland.Robert Wise earned two Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture for ""The Sound of Music"".  The film also won Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music Adaptation and Best Sound, and received nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Costumes and Best Set Design.  Overall, I rate this film with 5 out of 5 stars.  Some people do not enjoy the film at all, but most people will be endeared to Maria, Captain von Trapp and the von Trapp children.  I highly recommend purchase of this DVD."	5.0	"""These are a few of my favorite things!"""	2003-02-19	5	5	0

I watched this movie on a dare and was absolutely mortified!!!!! I would have given it negative stars if I could have. As an animal lover and vegetarian, I was especially offended!!! Anyone who is a fan of this series should run, not walk to the nearest Psychiatrist. You are in desperate need of having your head examined.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A16XRPF40679KG	Michael Dobey	There's alot more detailed reviews of this classic film on blu ray on amazon. Still I had to express how great this blu ray version is. So many movies like the 'horsesoldiers' or 'kelly's heroes'are just thrown out on blu ray; unrestored with dirt on the prints even! it's so bad that you would only pray that each new blu release is going to be done better. NO worries here , this is remastered and looks fantastic! the sound is fantastic, the movie is one of the beloved musicals ever! Julie andrews is perfection in this movie and the songs are beyond classic mostly. Even christopher plummer is awesome and he is not known for musicals! He's still at it in movies too, making great roles as usual.  But this blu ray has set a high standard for what older movies SHOULD look like on blu ray. Buy this one and watch it with someone you love, it's restored and hassongs that will appeal to any age group.	5.0	blu ray done right.	2011-12-08	2	2	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AQC34OY0W5UU1	Michael E. Gatenby	I positively love musicals and this is the VERY BEST. Classic Rogers and Hammerstein and a PERFECT cast wrapped around a fastinating story in one of the most beautiful areas of the world, at the most interesting (if not the most distructive) time in the 20th century. What more could you ask for? I've seen all the modern musicals and they will be very hard pressed to ever top the pure, unabashed feeling this draws out of people who grew up in the time, appreciated the music and cherished the performances. It will always be my favorite.	5.0	Simply the best!	2000-10-04	0	0	0

I was delighted when I heard that this  beloved classic would be released on DVD in widescreen and Dolby Digital  and with THX certification to boot!This movie has always been a favorite  of my family and I was delighted to see it for the first time in widescreen  never having seen the movie in a theater.  The grandeur of the scenery can  be enjoyed much more fully in this format.  Every song is a classic that  you'll love to hear again and again.  The picture and sound quality is so  superb, you won't believe it was released 35 years ago.  The bonus disc  with a making of documentary, musical outtakes and other goodies is a  welcome bonus especially considering the low price!For the price of a  single DVD, why not own The Sound of Music and a bonus DVD for your family  to enjoy for years to come?  You won't want to see it full-screen with  marginal sound once you've been spoiled by this wonderful set.Highly  recommended!  Buy it today!	5.0	I love this movie!	2000-09-08	1	0	1

I've been to Austria when my dad was stationed in Mainz, Germany and my 7th grade class spent an entire week in Vienna which is a very beautiful city by the way. This is a movie that a family can sit down and watch. I sing along with the songs. Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer all of them did a very good job. The funniest part of the movie is when she is late to dinner and as she starts to sit down she lands on the pine cone and the children find it so funny. Another part of the movie is when all of the Vonn Trapped children are playing in the trees and their father happens to drive by and see them. I just can't say enough about this movie.	5.0	I never get tired of watching The Sound of Music	2013-12-19	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1K2OHYVFYW52K	Midwest Guy	The Blu Ray is good, but if you have a good upcoverting bluray player and own this on DVD, save your money.  The Blu Ray version is not so much better that you need to buy this version too.  It's a great movie and one of my all time favorites.  I gave it three stars because it is way over-hyped special edition that tries to get you to feel you must own this new Blu Ray version.  However the difference between the DVD and Blu Ray is small.  The hype is too high.  If you don't own Sound of Music, then buy the Blu Ray. You'll be getting the best available version possible.  If you own this on VHS tape, you may want to upgrade too.  But if you own a DVD, think twice.  It is really not worth the extra money.	3.0	If you already own this, don't buy another	2010-12-27	12	5	7
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2ROC2OFSJ8G78	Miguel Enguidanos	This searing documentary about why we hear music starts at the very beginning, a very good place to start. It  tackles the tough themes of does and deers, climbing mountains, nuns and nazis (they go together like tea and jammin' bread). Jammin bread is really good by the way. It really is made for jam. Don't use jelly though. Tea is good with the bread. Unfortunately they think using the word 'fa' is the same as 'far'...stupid. If you don't know who you are they will tell you, you are me...well not me but you but they say me meaning you. By the way birth control doesn't exist in this movie but what do you expect with nuns and nazis!? The sad thing is there is this hot babe who is 16 and just about to be 17 and she is pushing this nazi guy into sex and because of his nazi upbringing he decides her whole family should die instead...sad.	5.0	Evidently this is about Music and why it has sound	2014-01-05	3	2	1
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AURZ4YQ270W3T	Mike Freed	&quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is a delight from beginning to end, and the DVD adds exceptional features and content that really round out the filmgoing experience.What review of this film would be complete without the requisite gushing praise for the opening sequence? It's justifiably famous, and gives an epic feel to a film that, at its heart, is a simple family story.Director Robert Wise lives up to his surname...he wisely takes a very effective minimalist approach with the story. Where a lesser director would have 'pumped up' the song sequences with flashier camera moves, Wise lets the songs speak for themselves and instead concentrates on getting the texture and feel of the scenes just right. &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is simply but beautifully shot.Julie Andrews is a delight as the plucky Maria, who starts as an erstwhile nun, becomes a governess, and earns the affections of the children of the steely Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer, all poise and polish), not to mention the captain himself. The children are all properly cute and talented, and the supporting performances by Richard Haydn (the charming sponge Max Detweiler) and Eleanor Parker (Captain Von Trapp's would-be society fiancee) hit all the right notes.If the film has a weakness, it's length; &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; weighs in at almost three hours, which is quite a stretch by today's standards. But in the original theatrical version, there was an intermission, which was common practice for long films in those days.There are also times that Wise plays it a bit too minimalistically, and the big finish should have more emotional punch than it does, but overall this film is an unqualified smash.It's worth noting that at the time of its release, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was wildly popular; in fact, adjusted for inflation, it's the third highest grossing film in history, behind only &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;.Not bad company for this classic film. And the second DVD disc included with this set - packed with production notes, interviews and extra information - just makes this a better deal.Enjoy!	5.0	A classic film made even better on DVD	2000-10-24	6	5	1

I see why they don't remake this move because I don't see how you can make it better. Funny thing is what inspired us to watch this movie again this year was we started watching the new version with Carrie Underwood and we didn't really like it. She tried hard and can sing well, but just can'tact. So we had to see the original with Julie Andrews and Christoper Plummer and thoroughly enjoyed seeing itagain.	5.0	classic movie that is always a pleasure to watch	2014-01-03	0	0	0

I will tell you about the dvd.  As a self proclaimed SOM addict I would highly recommend this version.  It has loads of extras not included on the other dvd releases.  Including a new commentary track (which is a cut and paste of comments (some you have heard already through out the extras on the disc) and a documentary on the von Trapps as well as a sit down with the cast plus loads more extras.As for the actual film the sound is excellent, the picture looks vibrant and clean.  And hooray for widescreen I've been so spoiled by it.  You simply can not watch this film in fullscreen!  You are missing too much!If you are a hardcore fan of this film I recommend purchasing this version andThe Sound of Music (Five Star Collection)orThe Sound of Music (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)(both releases (35th anniversary) are the same just a different package) have tons of extras not included in the 40th anniversary that fans will just eat up!	5.0	It Rises to Every Occasion!	2009-01-05	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2WPO7U5ZEXOKK	Mimi	"I've watched ""The Sound of the Music"" few times before on a laser disc, and enjoyed it vey much.  This is my first time I bought it in a DVD, so I don't know how much improvement in this 40th special edition from previous versions.  The picture and sound qualities are fine, and I like the sub-title feature.  This helps me to understand every words that they speak.  Juliet Andews' commentary is at the beginning of Disc 1, and I have to press the ""next"" key on the remote to skip to the menu screen to start the movie, I find that's quite annoying.  This movie is in a wide screen, so there are black bars on both sides, top and bottom of my TV.  If I enlarge it, the picture become blurry slightly.  So, I watch it in  a normal mode which makes my 52"" HDTV like a 46"" tv. It's still ok."	5.0	Good musical movie	2009-02-22	1	0	1
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1736AL95MK9BB	Mimi	This is probably one of the greatest musicals ever.

She is sent to be a governess to a captain with seven children, and she brings joy and laughter in the house, where there was coldness and harshness and in the process she steals a man's heart and falls in love.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2O11TM0PSMB26	"M. Marcus ""Matt & Tracey"""	The Sound of Music is a classic for a reason, because it never loses its appeal.  Even my kids love this movie, they really enjoy it and enjoy the songs in the movie. I thought they would not be able to sit through the whole thing because it would be too boring, but not so. My kids are 10, 12, and 14 and they have loved this movie for years.As for this 45th anniversary pack, I was a little skeptical because I figured it was just another way to squeeze some more money out of the movie. Well, of course they have to get people to buy the movie again because most people already have the movie. However, the box set really impressed me.The booklet has pictures and writings from not only the movie, but it also includes history on the actual family. There were some really neat facts that I had no idea about. This family eventually moved to Vermont up in Stowe where one of the HGTV Dream Homes was built.All the neat little things that were included in the box set made it very special. Any Sound of Music fan would really appreciate this and find it a great investment!	5.0	It's still a great movie!	2012-07-22	2	2	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AI703KIZFFH5H	M. Masumoto	"The Sound of Music is one of the great film musicals of all time. I love this picture and I always have. But I don't love the new 45th anniversary Blu-Ray transfer.An incredible amount of effort has gone into bringing The Sound of Music to Blu-Ray, and the clarity of the new image struck from the original negative is remarkable. It's wonderful to see such loving attention given to a classic film. But in comparing this transfer to the previous 40th anniversary DVD edition, it's easy to see that something essential about the look of the film has been lost.The Sound of Music is a film with an expressive, impressionistic, exaggerated color palate. While not in the same league of color exaggeration as Gone With The Wind (for instance), The Sound of Music has backgrounds lit with multi-colored lights to imply moonlight, firelight, etc. The main characters may be lit both hot and cold, with a warm golden glow on one side of their faces, and a cold blue light on the other. These color variations and exaggerations are an essential contributor to the storybook-like atmosphere of the movie, and give the cinematography its rich look.The new Blu-Ray transfer has made all of the color too even, ""natural"" and flat. Instead of looking like a painting or an almost surreal fairy tale come to life, the new transfer has an overly-color-corrected, stripped down look which, in my opinion, is not in keeping with the original intention of the filmmakers.If you look at the previous 40th anniversary DVD transfer, you can really see what I'm talking about. Scenes glow with golden sunlight or cool moonlight, and there's a stylized look which I remember from seeing the film on the big screen in the 70's. When Maria and Captain Von Trapp dance the Landler in the courtyard, for instance, the hedge behind them is lit with several different colors of light representing moonlight and firelight, and they dance into warm light from the party, or into cool exterior light, etc.The new Blu-Ray transfer almost eliminates differences in these colors, creating a flat, hyper-realistic appearance which makes the characters seem to be standing on a stage set regardless of whether they're standing outside or inside. There's something about the newly-restricted quality of the colors which makes the film look cheap. I was really disappointed.Don't get me wrong. The movie's still great. But the technicians in charge of the color correction just didn't ""get"" the aesthetic of the film, in my opinion, and went too far in evening-out colors and trying to release the ""reality"" of the original negative. Surprisingly, the result makes everything look more fake, as well as less magical.The previous edition of this film just looked better, richer and more artistic. You may not have been able to see every blade of grass as you can in the new Blu-Ray transfer, but the colors and aesthetic presented by the older edition are, in my opinion, more in keeping with the filmmakers original intention.It just shows you how much of an art form color correction and film transfer can be.If you want to see a really fine example of HD film transfer, take a look at the Blu-Ray edition of the 1995 Pride and Prejudice mini-series with Colin Firth. Now, that Blu-Ray transfer ELEVATED the picture. If you want to see the depths to which bad color correction can go, take a look at the old DVD transfer of Babette's Feast, which really ruined the look of the film."	5.0	Great Movie, Questionable Transfer	2010-12-02	4	3	1

The Blu-ray version is like seeing it for the first time, seriously. I watched both versions to see if the DVD was missing footage it's such a huge difference. I'm not switching to all Blu-ray I have too big a DVD collection but I'm totally convinced on this movie that it's better! If you love it, you need to see it at it's best.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2QX3F8FX7XM1B	Movie Lover	I was very pleased with this special 40th anniversary DVD of The Sound of Music, with many interesting bonus features, including the Hollywood Von Trapps 40 years later (except for marvelous Eleanor Parker and Richard Haydn, who are no longer with us).  Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are still glorious and distinguished, and their chemistry still exists in a 2005 interview, yet watching them in this movie assures that chemistry and their beauty as a couple forever in movie history.  The DVD was most reasonably priced and in excellent condition.  I still am confused with Amazon's checkout procedure and called them by phone to make sure I wasn't buying two of the same product, as I had two other times.  Such a hassle to return.  Luckily, that did not happen with this DVD; this is a special one indeed and a most welcome one to my collection.	5.0	Great DVD	2008-04-05	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2E64CMFIW7SSY	M. R. A Bohm	As a child, I probably watched this movie 100 times. My sisters and I would hire it from the video store, and dance around the house to the music - we knew every word by heart, and never grew tired of it.20 years later, I still love The Sound of Music. The on screen chemistry between Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer is in itself worth watching the movie for. The love stories, heartbreak, Maria's journey to self discovery, the delightful von Trapp children, and the building political unrest between the Jews and the Nazis are skilfully blended by Robert Wise to make it a timeless masterpiece.Aside from the story, the breathtaking Austrian scenery is not to be missed. The Sound of Music held it's ground as the best ever musical between 1965 - 1978 when finally the musical Grease won the top spot.I now own the movie, and can't wait until my own children are old enough to fall in love with The Sound of Music like I did.	5.0	Masterpiece!	2004-11-19	6	5	1

This was my mom's favorite movie while I was growing up (she died in 1995 while I was still a kid) and I worried that it would not stand the test of time/memory. But it did. Julie Andrews sings beautifully, which comes through much better in Blu-Ray digital audio than it did on VHS. The imagery of the hills, lakes, and trees come through so vivid and alive it is infectious in its life. The story is uplifting, the acting is above par, and my memory's grow fonder. A great movie, though it does seem a bit long for very young viewers. My wife had never seen it and was entranced (she is 28 if it makes a difference). Definitely a drama/humorous video, NOT an action movie or true comedy.	5.0	Classic	2013-04-09	0	0	0

I might have been too young to really get into it but I remember it being so incredibly long and not all that interesting.  Many years later I watched it again and fell in love with this movie.Depending on your point of view Julie Andrews is most popular for The Sound of Music or Mary Poppins.  Both are wonderful movies and seem to get better with age.In The Sound of Music Julie Andrews plays a Nanny sent to watch over a former military man's large household with his many kids.  The house is run the only way the kid's father knows: militarily.  With the power of her smile and singing she wins over not only the kids but their father as well.  This story line has been done and redone since and before but The Sound of Music sticks out as a leader of the pack.There are very few movies I would say to purchase immediately but this is one of them.	5.0	Much better than I remember!	2006-01-18	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2BRZ4NPXOW3O0	MyReviewMyStory	Well this may be one of the few reviews you will read from a man concerning this video.  I grew up in a household full of girls and I was the only boy.  Needless to say, I never got to watch anything close to resembling a football game until I left the house.  One of the favorites of my sisters was this movie 'The Sound of Music'.  Every song, every phrase... memorized.  Not by choice, but through the repetition of my sisters constant viewing.I swore I would never watch this movie again once I was out of my parents house.  BUT, guess what.  I find myself a father and living in a household full of girls.  And of course every dad wants their little kids to be happy.  I remembered how much my little sisters loved and lived this movie when we were little.  So I decided to get this movie (I know I know I cannot believe it either) and of course my kids loved it.  The run around and sing the songs.Long story short:  This movie is a timeless classic.  Kids love the singing and the story line.  It really does look nice in Blu-ray as well.	5.0	A man's perspective	2013-11-12	3	1	2

It's a very happy musical but also very emotional and sad at many parts as you see the characters all go through changes some great (Maria and George being married) but as well terrible changes such as (Liesel losing Rolf so that he may join the Nazis) this is a great musical with so many different angles to watch it from and I suggest you see it many times so you can appreciate it from many different ways.	5.0	Pure Maigc	2005-02-05	4	4	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2AMQC9GHANQ9F	Natasha Milk	It's no secret that the real story of the Von Trapp family has altered for the screen. But who cares is there was no Rolf or that the Von Trapps didn't escape from Saltzburg on foot. You still get a classic movie chock full of rich and flavorful Rodgers and Hammerstein songs, a winesome performance by the great Julie Andrews, a happy ending and breaktaking shots of Austria. I strongly urge people to buy this DVD and throw their VHS copies away. On VHS, you lose most of the 70mm format. That means you get three Von Trapps vs. seven in a shot.	5.0	What I Movie...I Could Watch It Again and Again	2001-08-25	3	3	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AO0MV6QMT3LMW	Nathan	This one of the oldest shows I've ever seen, and the most musical. When I first saw the movie, when I was about three of four, I of course, fell asleep. When I next saw the movie, when I was still four, I actually stood awake and watched the movie.  When the show was finally finished, I could hardly even get face off the TV, even though it was done.

You were never told this?It was SS propaganda. Its initial intent was to demonstrate the moral decadence of Europe in general and the Austrian aristocracy in particular. It was meant to incite class warfare. Worse, it is cryptically pornographic and irreligious...a Mother Superior admonishing an aspiring nun to 'climb every mountain', 'search high and low'? Or, the widowed sea captain singing 'Idle-vice, Idle-vice...every morning you greet me'.The goat in the play; at first her eyes were flirtatious in their innocence. In skips the old roue (his hips suggestively a-jerkin') and they turn to sheer terror. More on the goatherds and goats later.The message? It is so obvious; these swinehunds are singing, dancing, partying, lusting and romancing whilst the winds of war are lashing the planet. But, for these oblivious numb-skulls, the bellicose air-currents are simply billowing clouds and skirts.We, The Enemy, are mindless fools. Cattle. The Bovidae actually believe they can solve or escape the world's ills with some songs and dances.This was widely screened across the Vaterland in '39, but it was pulled. Rather than inflaming socialist passions, it was putting audiences to sleep. It was a disaster. Students, so exposed, were failing classes. Or worse, some were caught, the next day, humming mindless tunes and trying to seduce their classmates. The teen-pregnancy rate soared, amidst promises of Rolf's ""I'll take care of you"" mantra. Marriages were destroyed as frustrated hausfraus, realizing they were not married to C Plummer, joined the nearest nunnery. Husbands were fantasizing about nuns in lonely dark corners. Sweet little girls in pale pink coats could not walk the hills alone. Goatherds were conscripted into the German High Command. The goats went feral, their numbers exploded without the seminal competition from their overlords, resulting in the denudation of the slopes...it was an ecological catastrophe. Gestapo/SS brass were 'toasted' for their failure of proper oversight. A rent in the very fabric of Teutonic society was imminent.The film's final scenes were never seen by American audiences. All of the Nazi/Brownshirt 'incompetence' was, in fact, a clever ruse to capture the entire family alone in the woods. The lonely goatherds had their way with the little girls. Need I say it was not a happy ending.Here, in America, 26 years later, it was hailed as a masterpiece with endless kudos and awards. Did we really win the war?"	1.0	Failed Propaganda Film circa 1939	2009-11-29	53	3	50

The quality on the movie (watched the Blu-Ray) was flawless in my opinion, and I'm known to be a pretty picky person when it comes to quality! The price was too good to beat for such a great set and I highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed this classic years ago!I must say, I was at first hesitant when I thought about all the extras that came in the box - I mean what would I need or do with all the items that this set comes with? But I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to see all the extras! The books were very interesting and the postcards were such a clever add in!! The music box was of such great quality and I truly enjoy listening to it. I think that for the high quality Blu-Ray (and DVD), the amount of extras, and the price, you really can't beat this deal!Seeing this classic on such high quality resolution that I used to watch when I was younger and still sing along to is probably one of the greatest recent memories I hold! I truly recommend this gift set to anyone interested or hesitant upon purchasing!	5.0	Greatest Box Set I've Bought in a Long Time!!!	2011-07-27	1	1	0

She goes to the hills when she needs to communicate with Satan, but as a nun her peers think she is going so she can communicate with God. The conflict between good and evil has never been presented in a more interesting way. It is the most creative musical ever made. The haunting overtones of ""Do Re Mi"" & ""Climb Every Mountain"" will make your skin crawl, as do the performances  of the entire cast , which is chillingly & thrillingly led by ""Oscar"" winner Julia Van Drews in the lead role as Maria Von Trapped."	5.0	The Hills are Alive!	2012-10-07	10	1	9

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	"Why anyone would want to view this classic in full frame is beyond me.  Shot in Panavision 70, the glorious vistas of the Alps and Austrian countryside are breathtakingly captured.  And then, of course, there's Julie Andrews.  From her introduction, twirling about the tip of a hillside, to her whimsical ""My Favorite Things"" Ms. Andrews is one of the cinema's  great guilty pleasures, a wholesome, smart and funloving girl next door that anyone would be happy to have as either their mother or girlfriend - depending on one's age.Fox previously issued this film as a ""Five Star Edition"".  Here, you don't get the fabulous extras, including a wonderful documentary on the history of the film and the Von Trapps.  But no matter which version you get, you can't escape the fact that this transfer, although better than the laserdisc or VHS versions previously issued, still has a long way to go to live up to the very best DVD transfers.  There is considerable digital noise in the backgrounds, some color smearing and a bit of edge enhancement and fine detail shimmering to contend with.  Though it doesn't necessarily distract, it is present throughout and does draw attention to itself, particularly if you are viewing the film on a screen 32 inches or greater.  The soundtrack has been nicely restored though at moments it can have a strident sonic characteristic that is slightly grating. Overall, Fox needs to revisit this title with a new transfer.  Still, no one can deny that the hills will continue to be alive with the sounds of music for many, many years to come."	3.0	The Hills Are Alive With The Sound of Julie Andrews	2003-03-01	31	28	3

It's a movie the entire family can enjoy together.  The songs have become standards.

In all of my thirty plus years none of the clips I've seen of this movie even hinted to me that I might like this movie.  None.  And I do like some of Julie Andrews work: Mary Poppins, Victor/Victoria are two that comes to mind.  But a woman whirling around on a mountain top--not so much.  Then for some reason that I don't remember now, I sat down and watch it.  AND I LOOOOOOVVVVE IT.  What fun!  The music, the optimism and the theme of the importance of family. Beautiful.

By the time the musical appeared in This movie, colleges every where were producing their versions of this musical.  And, some of the songs have become classics that are still heard as separate songs in serious musical vocal performances.First; this DVD is not quite as good as the original movie.  The images are somewhat duller and the sound is not quite as good.  However, it seems to be the best version now available.Next: If you do not know the story, a young nun, Maria, in pre-WWII Austria becomes a nanny to the Von Trapp children.  The nun enjoys singing and starts to teach the children some songs.  Baron Von Trapp is suprised at this development.  The Baron was about to re-marry, but complications set in.  Worse, WWII is about to break out.  However, life continues.  The movie does have a good ending.During the movie, we are treated to several very excellent songs and very good performances.

We wish that all the special features of past editions could have been incorporated into this 40th anniversary DVD.  Since they weren't, we'll continue to enjoy those on our VHS tape.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1F54ZJJ8EOEA9	paiige@aol.com	The Sound of Music is such a enchanting film.  I was engrossed from the moment I heard Marias' voice on the hilltops to the conclusion of the story. The slight mischevious nature of Maria and her lively zest pervade  the somber Von Trap family.  Every song is excellent, and the voices that  sing them are equally excellent.  The film overwhelmed me with its magical  and moving progression and I was sad to see it end!  The characters of  Maria, Captain, and the children are wonderful and likable.  Of course  there is a need for some kind of villian, and the baroness plays that part.  I am pleased to say that this movie is the best film ever created because  it truly touches the hearts of viewers more than any other film I have  seen.  The combination of the beautiful voices, exciting songs, likable  characters, and magnificent plot line and scenery makes this movie close to  perfection.  I am enthralled by the story each time I see it, and no other  movie has captured my attention and admiration to that extent.  It is so  magical that I must recommend this film for everyone, children and adults  alike.	5.0	The best film ever made!	1999-12-19	9	9	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3HNBLO0KIJVTS	"paper tiger ""Adriel August"""	I upgraded to this version of The Sound of Music on Blu-ray from the basic edition of TSOM and I am very glad I did. I picked up this set when Amazon had it for $28 as the weekly Blu-ray deal. It is a very nice, very solid set. I have many of these Blu-ray limited edition/special edition box sets (Blade Runner, Ben-Hur, Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, Casablanca, Planet of the Apes, I am Legend... ) and this is one of the nicest I own.The box is very solid and well constructed. Everything looks very professionally done and the box art colors are very vibrent. I didn't know what it was by the picture, but there is a little music box which is also very nice.The Blu-ray is wonderful in PQ and AQ. The only reason I gave the video 4.5 instead of 5 is because there are few scenes here or there which are a blur or out of focus. This is due to the scorce material and Fox did the best they could with what they had to work with. No matter what this is by far the best it has ever looked or sounded, and it all comes in this very nice set.I thought about it for a while, but I am very glad I pulled the trigger and purchased this set. A wonderful edition to my collection.	4.0	Classic Film. Wonderful Box Set!	2012-03-02	6	6	0

The difference was noticeable as soon as the film started and the camera panned over the beautiful views of Austria's mountain side. I heard birds chirping, which I don't recall before. Was that added to the soundtrack or had it always been there? In any case, I could hear the full depth and complexity on my surround sound.Then Julie Andrews appeared on screen and I was stunned. The clarity and crispness made the movie look like something that had been filmed in more recent years. The restoration is just perfect. It isn't grainy, yet it isn't overly glossy like some restorations that I've seen ruined when they tried to clean it up too much.I'm not sure what was done, but it's perfect. The hills truly are alive with the sound of music with this 45th anniversary edition. The movie is a treasure and has been given the treatment it deserved to preserve it.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2ODBHT4URXVXQ	"Peggy Vincent ""author and reader"""	It&#65533;s become fashionable to make fun of this musical, but the truth is that it&#65533;s still a great movie, great music, and uplifting message. Maria, the young woman who just couldn&#65533;t make it within the confines of a nunnery, leaves the convent and becomes nanny for a widow with a bazillion cute kids. In his grief and ineptitude, he has been trying to run the household along military lines, and it falls to Maria to add warmth, sunshine, music and love back into their lives. The movie is set in Salzburg during the early years of the Nazi occupation of Austria and is based on the true story of the Von Trapp family. Love, tragedy, drama, suspense, a daring escape over the Alps &#65533; and joy. Who could ask for more from a film?And then there&#65533;s the music, the Rogers and Hammerstein score from the Broadway play, which has given us such timeless tunes as How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria, My Favorite Things, Edelweiss, So Long &#65533; Farewell, etc.With Julie Andrews as Maria and Christopher Plummer as the Baron von Trapp, it&#65533;s a winner for all ages.	5.0	Delightful schmaltz	2004-01-01	6	4	2

If I was rich, and could afford to, I'd make sure that every school library had a copy of THIS particular Edition!When I was growing up, I somehow missed watching The Sound Of Music. Later in life, during my college years, a roommate suggested we rent it from the new movie rental store in Des Moines, Iowa. I told my friend that there were thousands of movies to choose from and perhaps we should find something else. Long story made short, I gave in and decided to rent it since I had chosen the previous 2 movies.We came home and placed the VHS movie into the VCR. I had some attitude going into it and somehow thought it was going to be a childigh movie that was predictable and boring for an adult to view. I was very, very wrong and I was never more surprised than I was after watching this great movie.I remember watching the movie and never even placing it on pause even once. Typically, I'd watch about 30 minutes of any movie and then take a break and make popcorn or get something to drink. Not true with Julie Andrews and this masterpiece-The Sound Of Music. I remember laughing and even shedding some tears. I was sort of mad at myself for not watching it as a kid, however I forgave myself and decided to keep it another day and watch it again in total privacy.When the 40th Anniversary Edition was announced, I called from friend in Iowa, Joeanna, and told her that I wanted to let Santa know what I wanted for Christmas. I wanted a brand new 40th Edition copy of The Sound Of Music. We both laughed as she clearly rememberd how she had to pressure me into watching it as I thought it was a movie just for kids.As luck would have it, when my recent Birthday came alone, I received a Priority Mail box at my front door. I literally had no idea what Joeanna was going to send me. We always exchange gifts and more than often she'll send a great looking sweater or some sort of gadget from the Sharper Image. I started to cry when I opened the inside box and found this beautifully packaged copy of the 40th Anniversary Edition of The Sound Of Music.A few years have passed since I used to rent VHS movies. So I'm all set up for watching movies with a great DVD player and a 65"" High Definition Toshiba Television. That same night, the night before my 36th Birthday, I invited my neighbors over to watch the movie with me. Just about an hour before they were supposed to come over to watch it with me, they called to say they were not feeling up to par and wanted to take a rain check. I totally understood and we agreed to watch it the following Saturday night.Guess What? Just like years ago, when I decided to watch The Sound Of Music on my own, I decided to revisit that wonderful experience and watch The Sound Of Music (40th Anniversary Edition) on my own.The movie was phenomenal! It was better than any version I had ever watched before. Because the movie was so incredible on my large television, and I knew I wanted to write an honest review, I thought it best to watch it again on my 27"" television-the one without all the bells and whistles! I wasn't at all surprised when the movie, being watched on my small Sony television, was just as tremendous and enjoyable as when I watched it on the big screen.With both TV's, I felt transported to a wonderful place and I enjoyed The Sound Of Music like never before. The sound was powerful and the clarity was much better than any other version I'd listened to. I wanted to mention that the color was more vivid that any other time I'd watched it and at times it felt as if I could grab hold of Julie Andrews hand and dance along with them. It might sound too good to be true, but this edition is the BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER WATCHED. I commend everyone who worked with the editing and all of the digital sound mastering that they pulled off.This was a gift that I will treasure forever. Since I didn't get the typical gift from my friend, I'm now faced with what I should get HER for Christmas. As I was pondering what gift to get her a light bulb finally turned on in my head. Why not get Joeanna her own copy of The Sound Of Music (40th Anniversary Edition) so that she can enjoy it since if it wasn't for her I might never have watched this incredible and beautiful movie?If there is one gift that you buy for yourself or for your family-Please purchase The Sound Of Music (40th Anniversary Edition). You will not believe how much great information is on the DVD aside from the movie itself. I think I spent 4 hours, alone in my viewing room, watching everything from the directors comments on almost every part of the movie to special scenes that were either deleted or not included in previous editions. You can find all of the many details of the contents of the DVD-it's really too much to mention in this short review.I just wanted to thank my friend for introducing me to a part of Americana that is a legend as well. Your entire family will enjoy the movie and your kids will enjoy any of several different options for viewing it on the DVD. I hope this review was helpful to you. I feel like watching the movie, again tonight, as it literaly lifts my spirits up high. I sometimes deal with a tinge of the blues-so what better medicine than the gift from the Cinema God's-THE SOUND OF MUSIC (40th ANNIVERSARY EDITION).Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I really hope that at least a portion of it was helpful to you.Peter V. CanniceScottsdale, ArizonaHorsepete@aol.com"	5.0	A Gift From The Cinema Gods!

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2GT65YTNYXBW3	Pet Nemo	My goodness, 20th Century Fox will stop at nothing to re-release a DVD.For the beloved classic The Sound Of Music, Fox has thrown in a bonus disc chock full of reminiscences from cast and crew to milk it for all that it is worth. It's not just a few minutes but contains lots of in-depth explanations of how they made the film, the difficulties on the location shootings and the real life Maria makes an appearance. It's also a breath of fresh air to see the child actors - some of whom have become grandparents. Behind the scenes, the actor playing the eldest boy said that Julie Andrews never lost her temper or got irritated over delays or made a mistake despite carrying the weight of the film on her shoulders. Well, I'm sure Julie's an angel despite in my own capacity having heard of bosses getting irritated, losing their cool or behaving unprofessionally.The Sound Of Music was made with the intention to touch people and it shows in the original film.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ	PhotoGraphics	I rarely write movie reviews.  What am I reviewing?  The writing, acting, content of the movie?  That is completely subjective, what one person likes another may dislike.  So am I reviewing the technical quality of the original film, the DVD transfer, comparing one release to another?  Well what if I have a great TV and sound system and another person has a terrible one?  What I see and hear may not be seen and heard by that other person.So this is strictly based on my viewing of The Sound of Music 45th Anniversary Blu-ray disc last night.Perfect in every way!  I have not seen the movie in a long time and the last time was on a TV with a picture tube and listening through the TV's speakers.This viewing made me happy I now have a high resolution widescreen TV and an excellent sound system.  I truly saw and heard things I never knew were in the movie.  I could not be happier that I now own this set.The most amazing moment was at the beginning of the church wedding.  My subwoofer has never gone so low.  But yet the extreme bass was perfectly controlled and clear, with no distortion.This Blue-ray set earns the highest possible rating for pure enjoyment.

Most of us grown-ups  still love it but at the same time we're also tired of seeing it over and  over again (maybe that's why it's not rerun on NBC every single year  anymore. I havn't seen it rerun since the Easter Season '95). Julie Andrews  takes her &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; success and adds even more to it with  her delightful rendition of the role that Mary Martin made her own on the  Broadway stage in 1959 and ran even farther with it than Martin ever could.  In my opinion, and I don't think I'm alone here, but I think that Martin  was too old for the part (she was in her mid to late 40s in the stage  version and Andrews was 30 when the transition to film came around--a  perfect age). As for the rest of the cast, it is just as talented:  Christopher Plummer, in the role he will forever be remembered for is a  achingly true Captain Von Trapp with those &quot;hidden talents&quot;  making subtle appearances throughout the film until blatantly bursting out  into the open in the film's closing scenes; Richard Haydn makes for a  comical and yet sincere &quot;Uncle&quot; Max, Peggy Wood is a starchy yet  compassionate Reverand Mother and Charmian Carr as Liesl stands out as our  perennial favorite of the seven children. The locales are breathtaking as  well (esp. the opening scene which is probably the most beatiful aerial  shot in all of film history and the cunning floral designs of the public  Austrian gardens during the &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot; sequence). So let's all  keep watching this most cheerished of all musical films each year and never  forget it's tasteful sentiment: to 'climb ev'ry mountain, ford ev'ry  stream, follow ev'ry rainbow till you find your dream'.	5.0	It just gains more and more fans every year	2000-05-18	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	The Sound Of Music is both loved and reviled by critics and fans alike.  Those who hate it find the film cloying, overly sappy and contrived and those who love it find it a joyous celebration of love, triumph and wholesomeness.  I think that movie falls someone in between.  The film can be annoyingly sweet, but it is also that sweetness that gives the movie a nave charm.  Julie Andrews is perfectly cast as Maria and Christopher Plummer is charming as the patriarch of the von Trapp family of whom Maria becomes the matron.  The film is a tad long, but the film is perfect for family entertainment where kids will enjoy and most parents will also like it as well.  The film has become something of an institution still earning screenings in the theater in most major cities.  The film was, of course, a bog office bonanza in it original release and it faired quite well at the 1965 Academy Awards winning five Oscars including Best Picture and a second Best Director award for Robert Wise.	3.0	Sound Musical	2003-01-10	2	0	2

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A5ZUZ49YRDPCV	Rachel Garret	"1965: Julie Andrews once again captures audiences in a musical film. The previous year, 1964, she won the Oscar for Best Actress in Mary Poppins. The Sound Of Music was based on the true account of the Von Trapp family singers, who fled Nazi Germany during WWII. Julie Andrews portrays Maria Von Trapp, formerly a novice nun who became the wife of the naval sea captain portrayed by the handsome Christopher Plummer. The fictionalized account is often sugary, with Julie Andrews providing much of the sunshine, but the last part of the film, as the Von Trapps flee from the Nazis, is darker than most films Julie Andrews has made.The ""nanny"" or governess role seems to fit Julie Andrews perfectly. As Maria Von Trapp, the governess to seven children, she is an echo of her role as Mary Poppins. She sings her way to the children's hearts and wins the hand of their father, the uptight, repressed captain. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer have genuine chemistry on the screen. Unforgettable is the Wedding Scene, in which Julie Andrews marries the captain in a long, dragging white gown at the cathedral. The songs are greatfrom this musical, which had in fact been a Broadway musical by Rogers and Hammersteins (this film, in fact, was a descendant of ""The King and I"" with a similar governess/master theme.""My Favorite Things"", ""I have confidence"", ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"", ""Do-Re-Mi"" and the eponymous song ""The Sound of Music""- which opens with Julie Andrews running across the Alpine hills of Austria, are memorable songs which have become part of American culture. On DVD, the experience is superb and beautiful, with trailers and features that are delightful, recalling an innocent time, recalling the poignant magic the film had years ago, fresh and strong even today."	5.0	The Sound Of Success: Musical Masterpiece	2003-03-26	3	2	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1LDIMQISH07WK	Rebecca	THE SOUND OF MUSIC is truly a masterpiece. It's my favorite musical of all time, and one of the best love stories ever told, too. This film takes place during World War II with Maria (Julie Andrews), a young &quot;nun-in-training&quot;, who lives in a church in Austria. Maria is a little clumsy and loves the outdoors. The mother of the church senses that maybe Maria isn't all that happy as a nun being locked up behind the church bars all the time, so she lets Maria go by giving her an assingment: to be the nanny of a retired wealthy sea captain's seven children, whom are very difficult, of course. But Maria ends up winning over the affection of the children by her singing and caring. And, eventually, ends up winning over the stern captain's love - and then marrying him. But then, the Nazis take over Austria and the Von Trapp family must run away from home before the Nazis come and take away Captain Von Trapp. That is when the real adventure and excitement of the film begins.THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a filmed that should be owned and treasured by everyone. Every household should at least have one copy of this truly treasured classic musical. Probably the best musical that ever was. All of the actors are superb in this film, and the music is just enchanting. One viewing of this film and you will remember it (especially the music) for years to come. I don't see how anyone could not like this film. I've watched it countless times on video (I have the older, double-tape version), and will continue to watch it.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A281NPSIMI1C2R	"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review"""	"The breathtaking Alps, lakes and grassy slopes welcome you into the charming land of Austria. The wide open spaces give an instant sense of freedom. The scenes are set in Salzburg, Austria in the 30's.  Suddenly you will see a grassy slope and Maria (Julie Andrews) bursts onto the screen with her childlike joy and sweet innocent nature. Her soul lives to be free, her arms stretch out (as in the cover picture) as she swirls around singing as only a person who is a child at heart can. Suddenly she realizes she has wandered far, far away from the Abbey.  The nun's know Maria all too well and start a discussion about why they love her so much. ""She's always late for everything except for every meal.""  Maria seems to be fighting her innermost desire to be free and it is very apparent she is not well suited for the calling. Her Mother Superior sets her free to follow her heart by helping her to see the need to accept a position of Governess to ""seven"" children.""You have to live the life you were born to live."" --Mother SuperiorSoon the children have learned to sing, frolic with life and completely exasperate their father who discourages any sign of fun. Once he leaves for a visit in Vienna, the children get to go on picnics, bike rides, train rides and other fun adventures. Laughter is in every scene and singing is the focus.When their father, Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a lonely widower tries to introduce a haughty Baroness to them, they are not at all impressed. So the stage is set for humor, love, happiness, sadness, fear, jealousy, deceit, romance and adventure. The chemistry between Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer reaches its height in a beautiful Austrian folk dance. The tension mounts and the Baroness appears.  She has truly evil intentions for Maria and the children, who she would just as well send off to boarding school.In the first half of the movie, life is pleasant and follows an upbeat theme. In the second half, you will have trouble not crying all the way to the end. Happiness can sometimes make you cry as well. You can literally feel the invincible human spirit rising in you as you celebrate the family's daring flight from Nazi rule. Only a true story could be this inspirational. I truly cannot watch this movie without wanting to sing along with at least half the songs. Julie Andrews voice is magical. If you appreciate impeccable acting, breathtaking scenery, and a feeling of true romance....call me sentimental, but you will love this movie. The only thing which saddens me is that some people are truly too jaded to appreciate the beauty in this movie. I guess I still have the child in me that wants to believe in a fairy tale, yet this was based on a true story, and perhaps real life is the best story of all.~The Rebecca Review"	5.0	My favorite musical of all time!	2000-10-07	3	1	2
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1LEFRG2X96CHM	"Rebecca Sanborn ""Becca"""	This is my second favorite musical after Annie. It's brillant in every way. The music is great for all ages, a great movie for little ones but you can still enjoy it at age 50. The movie follows, Maria, a young woman who leaves the convent to become the governess of the children of Captain von Trapp. She is the one who wins over the children and their father with her warmth and her wonderful songs. Taking place during World War II though presents the family with a forced escape from the Nazis. It truly is one of the best musicals ever made. Every house hold should own a copy.	5.0	Becca's Favorites	2001-07-26	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1YU3JQIT9421C	Richard Brennan	"In some circles SoM is known as the corniest movie ever made.  In Hollywood, it's held in at least a grudging esteem.  After all, is was a blockbuster unlike anything else up to that time.  But SoM also represents  a very high level of film craft - in my opinion it earned every ticket it  sold.The screenplay by Ernest Lehman is first rate.  You really should  subject yourself to the stage play some time to see how much he improved on  the source material.  For example, on Broadway ""The Lonely Goatherd"" is  sung by Maria to calm the children through the thunderstorm.  It's a throw  away song.  In the movie, it's that spectacular puppet show.  What an  original idea!  Plus it underlines how close Maria and the children have  become (especially to the Baroness!)Then there is a sequence that makes  up maybe 20% of the film that begins with ""My Favorite Things"" and ends  with the spectacular ""Do-Re-Mi"" that has practically no dialog.  Yet it  vividly chronicles the transition in the relationship between Maria and the  children as she goes from enemy number one, to beloved surrogate mother.  While both songs were in the Broadway show, neither one moved the story  forward in this way.And what style!  Do-Re-Mi builds on the cutting from  one location to another pioneered in Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen's ""On the  Town""  (specifically the New York, New York number).  But it does it so  much better.  The scenes are carefully choreographed so they edit together  smoothly; you are not jarred at all by the quick transitions.  This is a  musical that takes advantage of everything film can do well, such as  collapse time and space so a single song (Do-Re-Mi) shows us weeks in the  lives of these characters.Julie Andrews takes a potentially sappy  role, and gives her some bite.  Christopher Plummer underplays superbly.  Interestingly, his performance looks better every time I see it.The  second half drags a bit.  ""Something Good"" has never really appealed to me.  It's always seemed like the ideal time to sneak out and get some more  popcorn.  But, I guess the love scene had to be in there in some form.  I  do like the fact that they end the song in silhouette, and the background  reminds us of ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen""  - the other love song - which  occurred in the same location.Some people think Hollywood butchers Broadway musicals.  To those  people I recommend two films - Sound of Music and Cabaret.  Some stories can be improved on film."	4.0	From My Favorite Things through Do-Re-Mi: 30 Perfect Minutes	2000-03-08	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A38IOX2XJEF5B2	Richard Thompson	"This release gets five stars because the film itself is so good, and the transfer is gorgeous. ""The Sound of Music"" has never looked so good on video.With one exception, all the extras from the previous two-disk DVD are here. The Biography Channel piece on the Trapp Family Singers is missing, but there are two new archival extras: one with Mary Martin and the other, ""The Sound of Movies,"" which used to be a separate release.The new HD extras, however, are pretty dreary. They're ""interactive,"" which in this case means you spend lots of time negotiating cutesy-poo menus and getting little in the way of rewards. You can't actually go to one of these short segments without hearing the menu music before the menu itself actually appears. Finish one little item, and you have to hear that music all over again before the menu buttons appear. If you can hear the opening to ""So Long, Farewell"" one more time without getting homicidal, you're a better person than me. Before you ask, there's no ""play all"" option. It's a gimmick, and not a very good or well-designed one at that.For the transfer and the other extras, though, this is a must buy."	5.0	The Transfer's Great. The New Extras Aren't	2010-11-14	5	2	3

It was my eldest sister who introduced me to this magically made movie and perhaps one of the best musical movie genres ever made. I recommend for those people who wanted to see this movie in DVD version because of the superb sound quality of orchestration and wonderful scenery of the film. One could easily fall in love with the music and lyrics of Rodgers and Hammerstein! and easily to get into your mind all the songs and become an instant favorite!It was indeed, Julie Andrew's trademark as Maria and she could truly be remembered as wonderful Froilan Maria (aside from her role as Mary Poppins) for seven children of the Baron Von Trapp. Christopher Plummer is dashing and handsome in this film and possessed a cool and calm voice.This is a must-have entertainment collection for the whole family for a truly 100% family entertainment.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3LPQAPU2ILDD0	R. McRae	"The best example of Hollywood getting it right. Broadway could never begin to recreate the Austrian Alps like this! The magic of great cinematography. Director Robert Wise wowed film goers with great opening shots of New York skyscrapers in ""West Side Story,"" but went one step further in ""The Sound of Music"" with its lush mountain beauty. Julie Andrews spinning on top of a mountain peak singing the title song makes for great moments in filmdom.One of the most family friendly movies of all-time, each viewing takes us back to a time of innocence in our lives. Who doesn't fight back the tears of seeing a harsh Christopher Plummer, playing the widowed father of the Von Trapp clan, allowing his affections to once again break through towards his 7 children, as he joins them in song. Or one of my favorite moments, the ""So Long, Farewell"" sung by the children at the  gathering of adult guests. I find myself wanting to wave goodnight to them as well.

So many of the key scenes in the movie rely on the play between light and shadow.  It's all rendered masterfully in this release.  You will see sumptuous details in the clothing, the paintings, the wallpaper, the stonework that you may never have noticed before in the dreamier but muddier versions all awash in pink and pale green.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AGZVS6M8XJGN6	"Roberto Frangie ""Robert"""	"If ""West Side Story"" was the best musical film of the sixties, then ""The Sound of Music,"" adapted from the long-running Broadway musical play about Maria Von Trapp and her singing family, was certainly the most popular...With a story that includes the right amount of family sentiment (the Von Trapp children never quarrel among themselves), religion (in the Hollywood tradition of serene, kind nuns), romance (actually two romances, one adult, one adolescent), and anti-Nazi feeling (Captain Von Trapp refuses to surrender to the Nazi invaders)--and with director Robert Wise who is in fact a solid, conscientious craftsman and a fluent story-teller mercifully free of grandiose pretensions, ""The Sound of Music"" is perfect with its sumptuous location photography, immaculate, fluid editing, and splendid tones...The film does have a justifiably famous opening: the camera sweeps over the Austrian Alps to catch Julie Andrews, as mischievous, warmhearted Maria, exultantly singing the title song as she rushes through the bright green valley... It is an exhilarating moment that the film never really matches again, but there is plenty left in the remaining hours to please the legions of devotees...There are unquestionably some enjoyable songs and musical numbers specially when the eldest Von Trapp daughter (Charmian Carr) meets her shy beau (Daniel Truhitte) in the family garden, he sings ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" to her, and they do a charming little dance around the gazebo... Maria's music lesson to the children, ""Do-Re-Mi,"" is beautifully staged, set over several days as they amble in and around Salzburg, changing their clothing through camera wizardry... And perhaps the best of the songs is the simplest, ""Edelweiss,"" with a tender lyric and poignant melody that make a fitting last song for Rodgers and Hammerstein...Another of the film's virtues is Julie Andrew's performance as Maria... She cuts through the thick sentiment with her own sharply honed blade of authority and self-confidence, implying that at least she will get through all the high corn without damaging her self-esteem... It works to balance the tight-lipped stodginess of Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp, the ""adorable"" posturings of the children, and the artificial airs of Eleanor Parker as the haughty baroness..."	5.0	A winner on every count, with its score, its performances and its breathtaking scenery...	2007-01-14	1	1	0

I loved to sing the songs when I was a little kid.The DVD quality is great, the extras are very interesting, and the case is acceptable, less the disc holder, everytime I want to remove the disc, I feel I'm going to break it.The subtiles in english are ok, but in spanish they could write the translated versions of the songs, even better, they could include the spanish audio, the songs in spanish are as good as the english version, I wonder why they didn't. Isn't the best feature of a DVD the possibility to have many audio tracks and many subtitles.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1EVPKN4OP0WI9	Robert R. Garcia	Really, who can top Rogers and Hammerstein for music and that's just for openers? This should be required viewing to see what a real love story is all about. Robert Wise was a good pick to direct this musical. Decades ago the young Orson Welles was in need of an editor for Citizen Kane (1941), and Robert Wise helped put that movie on the map. Wise was asked to direct The Sound of Music (1965) after it had been abandoned by William Wyler on the condition that 20th Century Fox agree to finance The Sand Pebbles (1966). Wise, who also produced the musical, won his second Best Director Oscar and the Best Picture Oscar. William Wyler would have been my first choice for the Sound of Music, but not after I saw what Robert Wise did. We knew Robert Wise could do a great job with musicals after West Side Story. Julie Andrews was a great pick for Maria. By the way, what happened to that beautiful nose of hers? Why did she tamper with it? Anyhow get this disk.This blue-ray edition is fantastic in every way. A must see. Give your old DVD to someone else and get the blue-ray now.	5.0	Required viewing	2013-11-29	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A4UGMKUSX9XHI	Robert Stone	There are already some terrific reviews posted on this title - I found the top review particularly informative regarding the different iterations this film has has on DVD and praising the quality of this transfer, so I have little really to add - but I didn't let that stop me! To be honest, I felt compelled to post a review after watching this film tonight, Christmas night, with my family. This was the first time my 5 year old son and 8 year old daughter have seen this masterpiece - and they LOVED it! I have always loved this movie as well and  in the past had enjoyed it mostly during TV presentations and once on an old laserdisc. I had not purchased the prior DVD versions as this is a film I had been waiting to get in high definition - an admittedly dramatic step up from laserdisc!From the moment we hit play the whole family was blown away with the picture and sound quality. I was also surprised to see a few extra scenes which I did not recall - some additional footage with the kids playing around Salzburg and some other shorter pieces throughout - likely these are usually cut by the networks for TV showings so that was an unexpected treat. I feel this truly is the definitive edition of this wonderful film and I couldn't be happier that I had the chance to share it with my kids (and wife and in-laws) in such pristine quality on this sacred night. Somehow the higher quality level seems to increase the emotional connection one makes with a movie and I must admit as a 43 old dad several scenes brought tears to my eyes. I highly recommend purchasing this set which also includes a DVD version. I have not had time to check out the extras yet but they look terrific as well. If you have a blu-ray player and love musical theatre, you really must own this film. My advice is to just buy it!	5.0	Excellent Blu Ray	2010-12-25	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1WUMTJOASEL5F	"Robert ""Supermandisco"""	"Excellent movie musical with Julie Andrews as the headliner. I first saw this movie when it premiered in ""Cineramascope"" on the cinerama sceen, and it is the most memorable movie of that fad era, because that is the way it was meant to be viewed, and should be watched. I am so glad home theater sceens are accomodating those vibrant additives to give todays audience a chance to see how some of these movies worked. It was absolutely incredible to recall the giant size visions of the convent interiors, and deluxe ""mountainous"" scenery. The sights of seeing our beloved Julie dance, hop, skip, and jump throughout the movie with seven, (yes, seven), children next to her heels is a must see. I am not much of a complainer for intricate drivel or criticism, as long as the general feel of the movie produced is well worth the size of entertainment it gives in no uncertain terms. (This includes low-budget theater).On another note, the available soundtrack to The Sound Of Music is pretty much a necessity if one is to grasp the stereo scope of the music output. It gives another dimension to relate to the magnificence of this feature. And the cover photo of this product says it all!"	5.0	Julie makes the hills come alive	2007-02-20	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3H9JSM1SUTE4O	Robin Simmons	"What more can one say about one of the more, perhaps the most beloved, of American family films?It's hard to believe this is the 45th Anniversary Edition, now in Blu-ray, and it has never looked or sounded better.What makes this a perfect film is that it is a journey of a real-life family who only wanted to add harmony to a world facing a real evil.  And the other thing that works so well is that even though it might be labeled a ""musical,"" all the music is internally derived from performances within the story by a family whose job it is to sing.  Not bad for those who hate contrived singing and dancing!On top of all this, besides the perfect story, casting and direction (Robert Wise at the peak of his powers), it includes a love story (really a double love story) and a harrowing journey over the Alps - a glimpse of heaven? - on their journey to freedom.Julie Andrews is almost incandescent as Maria, the spirited young woman who brings love and music to the home of Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children.Rodgers & Hammerstein must be spinning -- with delight -- in their graves.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2GQOI25E6UY25	RolloTomasi	"Few films have been as overwhelmingly popular as ""The Sound of Music""...and few films have borne as much contempt from critics, who tend  to dismiss its sentiment, its simplistic themes, its lack of ""depth,"" if  you will.  A giddy, tune-spouting nun (Julie Andrews, at her best) who woos  an Austrian captain and enchants his seven equally giddy, tune-spouting  children?  ""Bah!"" they say.  Sure, it won an Oscar for Best Picture, but  it's also one of the only movies to accomplish that feat and yet not  receive a screenplay nomination (""Titanic"" was another, go figure).  Is  this sophisticated, provocative filmmaking?  No.  A better question--who  cares?There are, no doubt, many ""greater"" films, but I doubt that even  the best of them are as durable, as endlessly enjoyable as this one.  I  wouldn't hesitate to label it a masterpiece.  I've memorized every frame  since I was six and it still leaves me spellbound each time I see it, and  that's a claim to fame only a full-blown masterpiece could make--I mean, I  love ""Vertigo"" dearly, but even it would lose my attention the fiftieth  time around.  Not ""The Sound of Music.""  From that first stunning sweep  over the Austrian landscape to the rapturously uplifting final shot of the  Von Trapps crossing the Alps (if you don't consider that emotionally  resonant, I suggest you check your pulse), this is an unparalleled  entertainment.  And, of course, a musical second to none--I ask you, are  there any songs as delightfully hummable as the ones here?  I defy you to  enter a crowded room and find someone who doesn't know ""My Favorite Things""  off the top of his head.Alright, enough.  This is undoubtedly the most  undignified and ramblesome review I've written in a while, but I think I've  made my point.  It's been nearly forty years since ""The Sound of Music""  first entered theaters--and hearts--around the world.  A hundred years from  now, by which time the medium will probably have altered beyond  recognition, it'll still feel like a classic."	5.0	Still my favorite movie (admit it, it's yours too...)	2000-08-15	0	0	0

It's one of the most beautiful scenes in cinematic history. This movie is first rate and first class; the cinematography, the scenery, the music, the sound, the singing, the acting, is all remarkable and extraordinary.When Maria is struggling with her own doubts, fears and inadequacies and trying to discern God's will for her life, Reverend Mother tells her, ""The love of a man and woman is holy, too. Maria, you have a great capacity for love. What you must find out is how God wants you to spend that love. If you love this man, it doesn't mean that you love God less.""I was so inspired by that idea, that I wrote it down and kept it in my heart for many days. ""The Sound of Music"" is a wonderful, classic movie and I love the history that's blended into the story as well.Just fantastic.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	This Rodgers and Hammerstein show has been lambasted for years for being a sugary, wafer-thin confection, as opposed to some of their other, darker works -- Carousel chief among them.  However, taken on its own terms, how  can anyone resist the spectacular, melody-soaked movie, which is MUCH  better than the stage play?  Julie Andrews is so engaging you wish she was  your friend, if not your nanny.  The children are wooden at times, but the  score soars above nearly everyone's heads, and set in the stunning Swiss  Alps, and in Salzburg, Austria, which has to be one of the most picturesque  towns in the world, each musical number transports the viewer to a place of  joy -- maybe even nirvana.  The opening sequence, often satirized, remains  one of the most technically sophisticated and creative series of shots ever  put on film.  Each time I see this movie, the first shots of snow, with  whistling wind, stir an age-old excitement deep in my soul, and then --  woosh! -- you are on the expertly crafted emotional ride that is The Sound  of Music.  Christopher Plummer deserves special mention -- he is the one  performer in this movie who delivers a subtle, heartbreakingly real  performance, and he is without a doubt the most dashing Capt. Von Trapp  ever.  Angela Cartwright would later star in Lost In Space, though the rest  of the kids have been kind of missing in action. I think I have seen this  movie 30 times.	5.0	IRRESISTABLE	1999-12-17	8	6	2

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A36DRQ23O0VRHH	"R. Roll ""aus10rick"""	Just a short review here because others have been so definitive. I've loved this movie since it was originally released. I saw it when it first came out, when it was re-released, when really bad copies have been shown 40 years later during a summer movie festival and every version to come out on VHS and DVD. The blu-ray copy is extraordinary and you will not be disappointed with it. I thought it was just me who perhaps had not noticed all the things in previous versions that others have commented on. This is an excellent example of what blu-ray should be like.	5.0	It's about time	2010-12-06	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1JUYF5D6TFFHB	"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya"""	"The Sound of Music is, without a question in anyone's mind, the greatest musical ever made. It is the supreme ruler of the musicals, and all other musicals are its infants. Although many people today find this sort of sentimental, romantic, even LONG musical outdated and boring, and contest whether there are greater musicals, there are many good reasons why The Sound Of Music remains number one. First of all, it was the film that made a star out of Julie Andrews (she does an even better performance as Maria von Trapp than she does as Mary Poppins), 2: It was the 60's when this film was made, a pivotal decade, and a time for such heartwarming, romantic musicals to ease the stress-filled and changing world, and 3: It's unforgettable. From the opening scene in which a spirited Julie Andrews runs across the Austrian hills that overlook the Alps and sings ""The Hills Are Alive"", we are taken directly into the sweeping tale. Based on an actual event, that of the von Trapp family singers who fled Nazi Germany  during WWII, the story is essentially about an irrepressible, influential and loveable governess, Maria von Trapp, formerly a nun at a convent, who touches the lives of a naval captain (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children. The songs are catchy and memorable- ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Do-Re-Mi"", ""I am Sixteen going on Seventeen"", etc. The romantic chemistry between Plummer and Andrews, the pseudo romance between the Captain's eldest daughter and the young mailman who later turns Nazi. This is a perfect family film, as well as a romantic film for a couple. I fell in love with musicals just from watching this film. Five stars well deserved and on DVD, the experience of the Sound of Music has never been greater."	5.0	The Sound Of Music Has Never Sounded Greater	2002-10-19	3	1	2

But there will be someone as good. I grew up with Julie Andrews's movies and I love her. But if you try to compare her and C. U. you can't they are two different people and that is the reality. Two different styles, voices and they didn't try to rap it, Thank God. So in conclusion, Julie is still tops in her version and Carrie Underwood did amazing in her version. I enjoyed them both as excellent entertainment. doing live and doing a movie are too different things.

Priorities people! I finally, after years of hearing about this movie and seeing clips from it,  sat down and watched it. I'm not a big musical buff but what can I say. It  was charming and well done. It was also something else I didn't expect it  to be. Moving. I wasn't expecting the whole Nazi subplot later in the film.  The story actually got a little cryptic with one of the VonTrapp daughters  falling in love with a local young man who was actually in training to  become a Nazi. Sheesh! Christopher Plummer is magnificent as the patriarch  widower Baron VonTrapp who eventually finds love for Maria played by Julie  Andrews, a young nun who is asked to be a governess for his children.

I hated every single flipping year having to watch Sound of Music, Wizard of OZ, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when they came on the ONLY television we had. Now much older and wiser, those classics make my stomach roll when they come on. But now I can change the channel to any of the other 300+ channels (most of which have equally revolting programming).That being said, I try to be a good husband and indulge my wife by making little sacrifices like sitting through her favorite movie of all time &#34;The Sound of Music&#34;........I bought this for my loving wife's as part of our one year anniversary. This simple act was repaid in spades from the joy she exhibited upon opening it.

The multi-disc set is great. Unfortunately, in the first set I ordered the audio would pause during play on the Blu-ray disc in many spots while the video continued on. I'd have to completely stop play to get audio back. This was very disappointing given that I bought the classic for the music. No problem - Amazon replaced the set at no cost (really great service there!). Unfortunately the second set had the same problem.At this point I contacted support about the problem and was told that they would have someone look into the supply and suggested I wait a few days and reorder. Meanwhile, he would also expedite my refund and the free return of the second set. Again I thought the treatment of the problem by Amazon was outstanding.The support tech also suggested that I consider the streaming version of the movie but since I'd just watched it twice in the last 10 days and I actually wanted the multi-disc set, I didn't pursue this option. I ultimately decided not to reorder the set since I expect that the odds are I will end up with another set that doesn't play.I own a two-year old Samsung Blu-ray player and I've had no problems with any other discs I've watched on it.	1.0	Great movie, terrible disc	2013-05-18	9	3	6

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3F0HT2YG3X6CD	"Serkan Okar ""movie and music connoisseur"""	The Sound of Music is an awesome movie that you will want to watch over and over again. This makes it a must-own purchase for any movie fan who appreciates beautiful scenery, wonderful story, and amazing soundtrack that had an unprecedented commercial success and almost unsurpassable even by today's sales standards.This is the story of Maria, an adorable young woman who lives in a school for nuns but often finds herself overwhelmed by her love of music and life in general (given the beauty of the surrounding area, the hills, the river, that is quite easy to do). She gets assigned as a governess to the house of captain Von Trapp who lives with his 7 children. Captain Von Trapp (portrayed by Christopher Plummer) is a very disciplined man to the point of being militaristic with his children and his ways soon clash with the more loving and affectionate nature of Maria.

The love story between the Captain  and Maria is breath-taking.  The dance scene always makes my heart beat  faster.  Determination and the human spirit are the forces behind this  movie.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2XY9RF0M4B7UF	Shirlz	"I first saw the Sound of Music when I was in the first grade. I remember liking the songs  (Do-Re-Mi was always a favorite) but not understanding the story at all. The six -year old me never did quite get the whole Nazi part of the film. It wasn't until years later I understood what the red flag with the weird spider, as Gretl (or was it Brigita?) calls it, really meant, and it was then I fully comprehended the heaviness of the third act of the film.As I was going through a musical dvd shopping spree I decided to revisit the Von Trapp family. Realizing that the time I saw it in 1st grade was the ONLY time I had actually seen the film. 20 years later I sat down to watch Julie Andrews sing about the hills being alive and a few of her favorite things, and I was riveted from start to finish. I half expected to stop the dvd or skip a few chapters, but instead I was enthralled in the story line which I could now, as an adult, both understand and appreciate.While the threat of the Nazi regime's take over of Austria is woven throughout the story, it does not take center stage. What is at the heart of this film is the power of music and how it can save a life and awaken the soul.Up until Maria's arrival at the Von Trapp household (or should I say mansion, the place is huge!) Captain Von Trapp treats his children like little soldiers--they march and stand at attention at his command, and respond to his whistle like dogs.  Maria's entrance into the household brings tenderness and the showing of love back into the home.  What follows is an endless parade of musical magic, songs that stay stuck in your brain and moments that make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.As a viewer you bare witness to the evolvement of a man and his family who are captivated by sweet Maria, and the flourishing of a love between a man and a woman. It was a story that was so good I didn't want it to end. As the filmed closed, and the camera pans back to reveal the family making their way through the mountains, I found myself truly sorry to say ""so long, farewell, auf Weiderseshen, good night.""The film is truly lovely, and the Blu-ray presentation is spectacular.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3UJW7N2WVT5UR	"""shrek102683"""	I recently bought the Five Star Collection Edition of The Sound of Music, which has been one of my all time favorite movies since the 3rd grade, and was amazed. The film has NEVER looked so good or sounded so good. The commentary was excellent, and I love how it also presents the musical numbers WITHOUT vocals, so you can sing along. The extras on disc 2 were great too. I gave it 4 stars simply cause it seems there wasn't enough features, but what's on there is absolutely amazing. There's 2 documentaries, one from 1965 hosted by Charmaine Carr, who plays Leisl, and the 87 minute documentary that not only discusses the making of the movie, but the true life story of the Von Trapp family. There's the audio supplements, which have interviews with people who worked in and on the film. There's the gallery which is filled with photos and information. And the selection of trailers and TV spots, while probably incomplete, is still good. I just feel that they could have included some home video release TV spots, other re-release trailers, or what have you. But all in all, this DVD is good and the movie looks and sounds as good as ever in it's original 2.20:1 apect ratio, allowing you to see all of the incredible settings, including the on location filming. This DVD is worth every penny.	4.0	A film worthy of this DVD.	2002-10-30	11	10	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AI6GZ3K0QRQ0X	Sidney L. Vaught	"The Blu-Ray release of ""The Sound of Music"" is the most beautiful edition ever.  There are details in the film I've either never noticed before or some I haven't seen since the 70MM theatrical release in 1973 which I saw on a large Todd-AO curved screen.  Be sure to notice the details in the scenery, the little houses in the distance you really don't see on other editions, the roughness of the stone walls in the abbey and the detail of the fabric in the costumes. You can even focus in on a single blade of grass while Julie Andrews sings the opening sequence.Unfortunately you don't get the curved screen effect on a flat panel but the colors are so much more vivid and warmer than other editions.  All the little extras in the collectors edition are sweet touches too, especially the little book that comes with it.Julie Andrews is at her best and her most beautiful in this edition.  I have seen this film probably hundreds of times in my life and I must say it is my favorite films of all time.  I was three years old when I first saw the film when it was first released in 1965 (yes, I remember seeing it then) and I was 10 years old when it was re-released the Summer of 1973 which ran for months in my city.  I went to see it about 17 times on the big curved screen.  I lived close enough to the theatre where I could ride my bike to the theatre and see the film whenever I was able to scrape together the dollar admission to see it.  Oh the simplicity of that age compared to now.  With the Blu-Ray edition of the film, it took me back to 1973 and it was just as exciting to watch.Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore which is a pity.  Call me a old softie, but I just love the feel good material, especially with all the insanity to deal with these days."	5.0	The Most Beautiful 'Sound of Music' Edition to Date	2010-11-14	4	4	0

I remember all the songs I was exposed to over and over from when I was little, don't you? From Anine, and Grease, and Sound of Music, and Fiddeler on the Roof.This is such a positive, fun, heart-warming movie with such great and simple songs for any kid to learn and sing. I think it is a must to counter-balance the world of video games, and violent and mindless T.V. to expose your kids, other's kids to something positive like this, AND, importantly, something they will enjoy!What a wonderful present.Here are some of the things this DVD will hold for you:The movie, of courseWonderful surrond sound, and sing alongs to the songs!Commentary by the actors and directors for those of you who want to get into the movie even more deeply...maybe because the wondeful memories you have of it!Still photos of behind-the-scenes and some screen tests and other storyboard stuff, which makes learning about the production of the movie great.Also, some previews too, which is a great walk through history.All and all, give a wonderful postive gife to any family, this is a great one!Lastly, I am in a review writing competition with some other people, so if you liked this review I would love your Yes vote, I write this review though with sincerity and hope for that the kids in the world will find the positive joy of musicals, before they run into the negative elements waiting to take their minds and money later.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AR1NP84PU84D4	S. Melvin	Do a deer...Sound of Music was a well done family movie/musical set in Austria during World War II.  The &#34;von Trapp&#34; family lost their mother and now the father, a naval officer, is left raising his children alone.  In an effort to ensure their proper upbringing, he acquires a &#34;nun&#34; (Julie Andrews) from the nearby convent for assistance.  This is where the fun and family friendly lessons begin (read: lots of singing).  The famous &#34;Do, Re, Me, Fa, So, La, Te&#34; song, &#34;Goodbye, Farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, Goodnight&#34; and many others.But enough about the movie - as you can likely read a much better review of that on another website dedicated to the movie...this gift box has everything you could ever want for this wonderful, classic film.  An excellent quality DVD/Blu-Ray (no, they didn't do the impossible and enhance it to current standards) for the quality of the original cut.  I'd say the certainly cleaned it up enough to avoid any excess noise normally seen on VHS and other old standards.  The box itself is well-made and capable of holding all the goodies you'll receive with this set.  And in the end...you'll have the opportunity to show this film to the next generation of children...keeping the Sound of Music alive.Overall - if you enjoyed the movie and believe it would be a great gift to give someone (or your own collection) then I highly recommend getting this gift set.	5.0	Great collection, great movie, fun for the entire family!	2013-10-02	0	0	0

Speaking of the story, unlike the case in a lot of musicals, the plot in The Sound of Music does not exist simply to move the film from one musical number to another. It is a truly memorable romance story that will stay with viewer long after the viewing experience. The entire cast is superb (the kids are adorable!). This was Julie Andrew's coup de grace. It deserves all the accolades (including multiple Oscars) it has received. Strongly recommended!	5.0	Lives up to its reputation!	2008-10-02	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2P2RNMX61QE47	"""spguyer"""	The Sound of Music blends all of the wonderful qualities of a great movie together into one splendid presentation.  From Julie Andrews lovely voice  soothes every fear and fills hearts with joy.  The Sound of Music is  beautifully scored, acted, directed, and filmed by the greatest artists in  their field.  The multitude of great acting talent, composed of Julie  Andrews, Christopher Plummer, and more bring the story of a young lady who  &quot;will never be a nun&quot; and falls in love for the first time with a  retired navy captain, whose children she cares for, demonstrates what great  acting ability can add to a masterpiece on celluloid.  Although the  movie is not entirely accurate in its depiction of the Von Trapp family  that escaped from the Nazis, it enlightens its audience with wonderful  melodies, voices and marvelously choreographed dances.  If you enjoy a  movie that is wholesome and entertaining, look no further than The Sound of  Music.	5.0	The Sound of Music -- a gem,a marvel, a masterpiece.	2000-09-04	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3IG10D35UYT9F	Starfire	What can I say? What can anyone say about 'The Sound of Music'? It's got everything: love, evil, laughter, children, the Alps, nuns, and of course the delightful Julie Andrews. Now, finally, here is the definitive version of the old screen classic that has become a cult favorite. The old cast is brought back together for a reunion, the kids are all grown up now and dissipated into different life styles, Julie and Chris still look great together...really, this 2-Disc DVD set has it all.I don't think anyone needs reminding of the story, so I won't dwell on that too much. My parents' generation grew up on these songs, as did I. The glorious music of Rodgers and Hammerstein have kept this epic landmark of a film in the hearts of three generations, and no doubt still more to come. Just go up to anyone and whistle 'Do Re Mi' and I promise you they'll recognize it. This film has become so ingrained within our culture that young kids don't even realize that the old tunes they've heard over and over are actually from 'The Sound of Music'.Everytime I have enough time to sit down and watch this film again, I am filled with a sense of escape. I can leave this chaotic world and enter Maria's realm of innocence and first love. This film stands for old values that are hardly seen anymore in today's modern world, and certainly it does not do well to dwell on past times. But escaping from time to time is fun.The extras on this DVD are really something. I particularly enjoyed the fireside chat between Julie and Chris Plummer where they reminisced about old times. The featurettes scattered throughout are also very informative and give an in-depth look into the creation of one of America's best-loved films. The reunion of the von Trapp children, now in their 40s and 50s (or 60s in the case of Liesl), presents a nostalgic look into an excursion in their past. I'm rather amazed the littlest one still remembers that much; I certainly wouldn't if I were five. Commentaries by Julie Andrews are also delightful to hear, she really is a dame and one of the most elegant people alive.So gather your family and friends around you, pop in this DVD, turn on the surround sound, and let the music wash over you! Some people call it corny, but I say 'So what? Just let go and have fun!'	5.0	Watching this film is perfect bliss...	2006-03-07	4	4	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AT07UZQQR7ZEH	"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov..."	"Oscar-winning producer/director Robert Wise is dead at 91.  He lived a full and wonderful life, and his cinematic legacy covers all genres.  Check out this partial lineup from just the 1960s-WEST SIDE STORY, TWO FOR THE SEESAW, THE HAUNTING, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, THE SAND PEBBLES, and STAR!  Wise started out as an editor at RKO.  He edited CITIZEN KANE and (re)edited THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS for Orson Welles in the early 1940s, then directed one of the scariest of the Val Lewton psychological chillers:  THE BODY SNATCHER (1945) and a great boxing drama called THE SET-UP (1947).Wise's most famous film is probably the Oscar-winning Best Picture and Director winner, THE SOUND OF MUSIC (1965, Fox).  It and WEST SIDE STORY were what came to my mind first when I heard he was dead.  I was going to single out a less well-known Wise film for review here until I took an informal poll and found that a startling number of friends and business associates on my e-mail distribution list had never seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC uncut and non-commercial anywhere-theater or home video--, just parts of it butchered and with commercials on NBC or ABC.  So I recommend watching a studio print of THE SOUND OF MUSIC on deluxe double DVD to salute a great and incredibly versatile filmmaker.MUSIC was first a real-life drama, then a 1950's play by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse with Mary Martin and songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein, then an enormously popular Best Picture Oscar winner in the mid-1960's.  It is about the courageous Von Trapp family trying to live with the Nazi occupation of Austria in 1938 Salzburg, then later attempting to flee the country as professional singers.  Christopher Plummer plays the widowed Captain with seven children; Julie Andrews got an Oscar nomination (one year after winning the award for MARY POPPINS) as nun Maria who is much too independent to ever be whatever comes next for a nun.  During a night storm, she teaches the kids ""Raindrops On Roses""-until she is interrupted by a drenched Liesl (Charmian Carr), oldest of the children, who has been in the moonlit yard gazebo singing ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" with young Nazi messenger Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte).MUSIC was filmed all over Salzburg.  Bike riding around the town in olive and white window curtain clothes, climaxes with ""Do Re Mi"" on top of a beautiful mountain.  Shortly thereafter, the Captain is furious to learn that his kids have been wandering all over the town in bedsheets, albeit having a wonderful time.  But his anger is calmed when his fiancee, Baroness Eleanor Parker, finds the kids charming.  Meanwhile, Maria is slowly falling in love with the Captain, and he with her.  There is a fun puppet show, which is often cut for time on TV.  The kids and the Captain all sing the lovely  ""Edelweiss"" to the Baroness and show biz manager Max (Richard Haydn).  But during a lavish party, Maria leaves the mansion with a goodbye note for the Captain.  Intermission.  We are about 100 minutes into a 174 minute movie that has restored roadshow music and intermission on DVD.I have seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC on stage, and it just dies, despite the wonderful songs and competent actors, because of painted backdrops for the town and Alpine mountain meadows.  By contrast, this Robert Wise movie (scripted by Ernest Lehman) is a masterpiece with dream casting to match the incomparable songs.  After the intermission, Maria returns and the unhappy kids come to life again.  The Baroness realizes that the Captain is in love with Maria and fades into the background; Parker is wonderful in this role.  The Captain and Maria have a romantic duet ""I Must Have Done Something Good"" in the moonlit gazebo; so do Liesl and Rolfe, which is tricky because an Austrian girl is romancing a Nazi, who becomes a villain in the last half hour.The Von Trapp family and Maria have to flee a country plagued by insidious Nazis.  But first the Captain and Maria get married, in a cathedral with grand music.  Maria got permission from the Mother Superior (Peggy Wood), who gets to do ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"" for Maria in her church office.  The big climax to the movie is a performance of ""So Long, Farewell"" and ""Edelweiss"" for a packed audience in a theater that has Nazis taking up the entire first row and guarding the exits.  But you know this movie has a happy ending, or else it would get booed!  A gripping night graveyard scene leads to an enthralling finale that gives me goosebumps every time I see it.  The movie won five Oscars and was nominated for several more.Do yourselves a favor.  THE SOUND OF MUSIC, again, runs 174 minutes and is usually cut to 145 minutes for showing on commercial TV.  Trust me, this show needs to run a full three hours.  It does NOT have half an hour of dead material!  You can buy a bonus-free studio print DVD for $10, or the super-duper Five Star Collection for about $30.  (It looks like this one is on temporary moratorium so that Fox can bring out a 40th Anniversary edition soon.)  The more expensive edition belongs in every family.  Among its exhausting bonuses are audio commentary by producer-director Wise (who wisely keeps quiet during the songs), an extensive 87 minute filmmaking documentary, Charmian Carr's home movies as Liesl, a congratulations telegram from Dan Truhitte (Rolfe), a 36 minute 1965 documentary on the beauty of Salzburg, audio comments by writer Ernest Lehman and Julie Andrews, and what seems like someone's uncut dissertation.  It ran several hours (!) for me and is self-generated with arrows you push at your own speed, documenting the history of the Von Trapp family, the creation and production of the 1950's play, pre-production through post-production almost day by day for the movie, and what the family has been up to since the movie.This is one stupendous DVD, which also gives you a THX-mastered soundtrack and the original widescreen aspect ratio (so you can see all of the children and all of the outdoor scenery at once).  Man, I love this immortal screen classic!  I find it unimaginable that people exist on planet Earth who have never seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC in a theater or uncut and non-commercial somewhere else somehow.  For Heaven's sake, treat yourselves, on a birthday or anniversary-or Robert Wise's death, to one of Hollywood's greatest musicals with the Five Star Collection of the movie on DVD.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3FNHYXXNW0BEW	Tay	"Before all you classic movie lovers scorn my title, I'll disclaim my review by stating that this is merely my opinion and you're in no way required to put any stock in it.So, I remember positively hating this movie as a child and, as a result, I've gone through my whole life avoiding it like radioactive waste.  I'm positive that I was well under 10 years old the last time I saw it and I'm equally certain that I fell asleep multiple times throughout it.  My brother has been asking for a copy for years because he loved it and I've even gone so far as to discourage other family members from buying it for him.  Pretty bad huh?  So, finally this year I bought him a copy for his birthday and finally he begged enough and I watched it...and I remembered why I hated it...but now I understand the reason better.  I hated the music!  If you're too young to understand the premise of the movie (the impending war, etc), what does the young mind focus on? The music!  I have to say, the music writers got away with very little work.  Having composed music and written lyrics myself, I understand how painstaking a process it can be, but having said that, these music writers had it easy. Every song in the movie is the same music and lyrics, repeated several times over for suitable movie musical length.  They are not melodically distinctive and frankly wander aimlessly in the boring note range.  Another disclaimer, THIS IS NOT A JULIE ANDREWS critique.  I adore Julie Andrews and think she did a great job with boring music material. The only remotely memorable tunes in the movie are Edelweiss  and the song about the lonely goat-heard.  Before you all say ""everyone remembers ""The hills are alive with the sound of music"" line!"", do me a favor and try to sing anything past that.  Unless you're a Sound of Music fanatic, that's all you're going to remember because the rest is BORING!  Unfortunately that's the way all of the songs are, they have one short part that you remember and the rest is sleeping pill.Moving on from the music, the story is generic, but charming. Although I have to say, and I'm sure I'm not the only one to have noticed, that this story is just the musical version of Jane Eyre with more children and set in pre-WWII Austria.  The transition of the main characters in the two stories is nearly identical as well, but if you do it right, that's interesting to watch. Upon first sight of Christopher Plummer's truly severe appearance, I wouldn't have thought they could melt him as quickly as they did, but I thought it was well done, if a tad sudden. Then by the end of it he appears almost dashing. Without the underlying threat of the oncoming war, the story would have no struggle, and would therefore just be intolerably ""nice"".  However, they did have some pretty good suspense there toward the end so that was a good touch.My bottom line, purely ironic as it is: I enjoyed the movie, but not the music."	4.0	The Sound of Music....would be great without the music.	2011-12-18	3	0	3

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F	"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard"""	"After appearing as the lead in ""Mary Poppins"" Julie Andrews solidified herself in pop culture and the American consciousness as the nanny and Nun Maria in ""The Sound of Music"". Ask any film buff what one of their favorite films are and this one always comes near the top. Winning multiple Oscars including Best Picture of 1965 ""The Sound of Music"" is one of the best movie musicals of all-time. Featuring Canadian-born Christopher Plummer in the role of a naval commander who is the widowed father of seven children, the film is equally known for its beautiful soundtrack and memorable songs. Based on the stage play of the same name, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of those rare films that has grossed over a billion dollars since it debut at the boxoffice. This particular DVD set comes with a slew of bonuses including behind the scenes featurettes and a splendid audio commentary by Julie Andrews herself. Both Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer recall the shooting of the film together and perhaps the greatest part about the bonuses is the beautiful reunion of all seven kids now adults discussing their memories on ""The Sound of Music"". It is wonderful that all seven actors still remain friends to this day. Lastly, there is an old screen test of a very young Mia Farrow who tried out for the part of the oldest child. Simply, you will enjoy the many multiple viewings you will have when buying this film. A film for the entire family."	5.0	"""Movies Don't Get Any Better"""	2009-11-16	2	2	0

I knew that she was a talented actress and singer and would not be disappointed in this movie. And I truely wasn't. It was beautiful to watch and made even better by the extras that were included on the second disc. I enojoyed watching Julie Andrews and Christopher Plumber talk about their time on set as well as watching the making of the movie with a visit from the real Maria Von Trapp. I would suggest this DVD collection simply because it is fantastic in every way and doesn't leave you disappointed."	5.0	Julie Andrews fan	2007-12-25	0	0	0

It took her a while to watch it as the opening scene did not lead her to want to go further but one day she watched a few minutes more and when Maria met the other nuns and they started singing my daughter was hooked. By now she must have watched it 20 times and still finds it funny.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AENS008HCBVC5	Theodore Illenberg	"I had a music professor who said he hated this musical because it was too syruoy. It is but, as Clint Eastwood would say ""I like syrupy, you got a problem with that PUNK! Musicals are suppose to be uplifting and fluffy. Most musicals from the 1940s through the early sixties were syrupy. Every song is a gem.The story centers around Maria a novice nun who is given the assignment of being the governess to the children of the widowed Baron Von Trapp. The musical opens with a beautiful panoramic view of the gorgeous Austrian country side. The camera then focuces on Maria where she sings the tile song. From that very moment your spirit is uplifted. Maria eventually goes to the Von Tapp home and wins over the children. One of the best scenes is when she teaches the children to sing by singing ""Do Re Mi"" While seeing this song the children are traveling through the beautiful city of Saltzberg. THe Baron Von Trapp was portrayed as a very stern and strick man. The real Von Trapp children protested the way their father was portrayed in this musical. IN one scene he fires Maria. After firing her he hears his children singing (the title song) in perfect harony and I MEAN PERFECT HARMONY. I get goosebumps every time I hear tis song. The Baron then melts when he hears his children singing he then asks Maria to stay. He eventually starts falling love with her. Maria become uncinfortable and returns to the convent. When the Mother superior confronts her she tells her that the walls of the convent are not a santuary from the real world. Then she sings ""Climb every mountain"" , which is my favorite broadway tune in any musical. Maria returns to the Baron and his children and marries him. While on their honeymoon the Nazis have taken over Austria. THe baron is then forced to serve in the Navy of the Third Reich. He tries to flee with his family. He is stopped. He tells them he is going to the musical festival. They take his family to the festival. In one marvelous scene he sings Eidelweiss. He was basically telling the Nazis what they can do with their Third Riech. And by the looks of their faces in the audience, they knew he was telling them what they can do with Third Reich. They then escape into switzerland.I realize the musical is contrived. The real Von Trapp family left for America by ship before the occupation of the Nazis.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1H1OKGCGD2EVF	theresa	For all that's been written about the schmaltz, this film tackles a theme too often ignored in American movies. This is a film about losing, and no matter how much dancing and singing precedes it, everyone in the film is facing loss.  The Baroness lost her dream match, Von Trapp loses his country, Leisl loses her first love, and who knows what horrors awaited Max and the nuns after the credits faded.  Maybe you have to be older to sense this theme, but once you realize it is there, the film becomes more rich and compelling.	5.0	Ultimately Sad and Adult	2004-12-28	16	14	2

Its a clean family movie and not like the ones they make today. This movie is so much better than the movies they make today!!! But I will say that if you love this movie when it first came out you will love it even more now. They did a brilliant job with this movie. Its clear, loaded with colors and the sound is great. It takes you away to another world, especially with Julie Andrews in her prime. She was simply awesome in this movie and carried it with her God given beautiful voice. The songs are contagious and the story line is deep.So much pain going on in the childrens lives caused by their drill instructor type Father. So much pain going on in the Fathers heart from the loss of his wife. Raising all his children on his own while trying to determine if he really loves the woman he is with now and if she would make a great mother to his children. So much pain going on with the country as the Nazis are taking over and the Father not wanting to join them which makes himself an enemy of the country. Last but not least all the pain Julie Andrews character is going through fighting herself about whether or not her heart is in it to dedicate the rest of her life to God as a nun and then coming between the father and his fianc&eacute;e as she falls in love with him and the children.Bring all these things together and you have the perfect storm for one heck of a movie!!! Now that's a story line that grabs your attention and pulls you in. How does it all work out? Well, if you have not seen the movie your going to have to watch it for yourself.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A30OXD42ZFYZLO	Thomas Keneally	"Robert Wise's ""Sound of Music"" was one of the biggest successes among the movies that are musicals. It has a decent cast, positive outlook and an appealing story that is black and white. Julie Andrews plays the part of a nun who becomes the governess for the children of a captain in Salzburg and is very good in her role. The movie was filmed in Salzburg and has beautiful photography. The screenplay was by Ernest Lehmann and traces their escape from the Nazis. The movie has a lot of beautiful songs. There is some decent acting by people who play the part of Max Dettweiler and the Eleanor Parker, who plays the Baroness.  A lot of the story is predictable though and too simple. The interaction between Julie Andrews and the children can be boring after a point, the dialogs especially.Kurt: ""What is incorrigible?""Maria: ""I think it means that you want to be treated like a boy.""I do not know who came up with that, but any person with minimum intelligence will get tired of such screenplay.There is not enough realism in the movie. The story makes Austria as the wounded country by the Nazis. One portion in the movie where they talk about Austrian pride and show it when they sign the song ""Edelweiss"" in public is all fictional. Though the government was against the Nazis, the people were not. In reality, they welcomed them and except for a small number of people, were easily absorbed into the Third Reich. Every where that the Nazi leaders went, they were welcomed by large crowds and now it is there in the web for public. In fact, Austria conveniently used this movie and its theme for years to act the guilty party. However, Austria's role in the Holocaust has been coming out of late with different confessions and it has not been easy. Even now, there is a lot of anti-semitism in Austria, perhaps more than most countries in Europe. They also make the escape from Austria to be too easy. In reality, it was extremely difficult. One has to look into the story of Paul Grueninger, who was the police chief of Saint Gallen canton in Switzerland. It was very hard for people to get an exit visa from Austria via Switzerland.Despite all this, people who love music can listen to the sound track for several reasons. It is the last one by Oscar Hammerstein and is beautifully written. It is one of the few movies that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, though I know people who are tired of it. It came out the same year as a number of great movies and yet had great success in the box office. It has Julie Andrews at her best with great outlook for the whole family, wonderful photography and Christopher Plummer doing a good job as a stern father.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A10CNESX5YEO1B	Thomas M. Olevano	&quot;The Sound of Music&quot; has never looked as good as it does on it's 2 disc DVD incarnation.  The audio and video is strickly tops all of the way.  The extras cover every detail of the history of Maria Von Trapp, the show, and so much more.  A Telegram from Daniel Truhitte is a nice little extra on disc 2.  Also if you want to do a sing along with the film then simply bring up the wonderfully done english subtitles.  As a great companion piece I also recomend that you purchase the DVD &quot;The Sound of Movies,&quot; since, it will only add further to your enjoyment of this classic film.	5.0	An outstanding edition of a timeless motion picture	2001-05-25	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3JADS9AZXTBAG	"Timstuff ""tim16733"""	In general, I hate musicals. But there's always been something about The Sound of Music that I cherish. Perhaps it's because it's based on a true story, or perhaps it's because the musical numbers are so well written that I actually enjoyed them. Either way, it's one of the very few musicals that I appreciate.The 5 Star edition DVD, while somewhat hard to track down, is definately worth the hunt. Don't sissy out and buy that crummy never-should-have-been-released single disc edition. This is the one to get. You get hours of in-depth history about the real-life Von-Trapp family, as well as alot of in-depth information about the Sound of Music musical, from it's birth as a broadway musical to it's silver screen debute. It's definately worth all the trouble it takes to find a copy.	5.0	It's worth tracking down over the single disc version.	2003-07-02	4	4	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ	Todd7	The Sound of Music (1965) is a long movie, but it never drags or gets boring. That's because it has a great setting, great acting, and, well, great music. Fresh off of her great performance in Mary Poppins just a year earlier, Julie Andrews' momentum and obvious talent yields a performance of a lifetime in this 1965 masterpiece. The supporting cast does a stellar job as well. Above all, this film gets the respect it deserves in the form of restoration that's superb. This film came out 48 years ago, but it's picture and sound quality give it a fresh look, as if it came out today. Don't miss this worthwhile movie experience, all things considered. The extras are good viewing as well. 10/10	5.0	A Wonderful Three Hours	2013-12-12	0	0	0
6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A810B1UF73H8U	Todd C. Martin	"At 33 years of age, I finally saw the Sound of Music...and I thought it was wonderful!  Although the movie is nearly three hours long, it possesses so much charm and beauty that I truly enjoyed every minute of it.  The segment in which Maria and the children perform ""the lonely goatherd"" puppet-show alone justifies purchasing the movie.  Other stand-out scenes include the nuns singing about how to solve ""a problem like Maria,"" Julie Andrews teaching the children about music with the song ""Do Ray Mi,"" and the children telling the guests at their father's party goodnight with the ""Cuckoo"" song (""Adieu, adieu...to you and you and you"").  Also, the scenary Austrian countryside is absolutely breathtaking!The Sound of Music is definitely worth seeing.  Don't just take my word for it.  Of the 233 reviews of The Sound of Music which have been posted on Amazon at this time (12/12/01), only 18 gave this film less than 4 stars.  Furthermore, 10 of these 18 mediocre reviews were only critical of the technical aspects of the DVD, and praised the actual film.Of course, the eight people who truly didn't enjoy The Sound of Music have every right to give it a negative review, and shouldn't be criticized for their honesty.  Even so, I feel a little sad that they didn't have the wonderful experience I had with this movie.  (...)"	5.0	I Loved It!!	2001-12-12	6	5	1

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AR6539Z04IBLM	"""tomovieboy"""	Reviled by some, beloved by many, consistently referred to as the most  popular movie musical ever made, THE SOUND OF MUSIC more than fulfills the  promise of its beautiful visuals and expert song numbers on home video via  DVD.  This edition tops the 1995 laserdisc by allowing the sparkling,  exemplary design of its 70mm. Todd-AO frame to be exhibited with increased  sharpness and resolution.  The 4.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack is powerful and  clean, but since this film was originally mixed for six-track magnetic  stereo, it's curious why the effort wasn't made by Fox to split the  surrounds!  Nonethless, the film sounds terrific. The extra features make  this package a bargain at the price.  Full length commentary by director  Bob Wise, with the musical numbers presented sans vocals, is a great touch.  And the two documentaries are beautifully presented; full of facts and  bits of arcane information that any fan will truly enjoy. A great movie,  and a great DVD rendition.

And now finally it's on Blu-ray at last.As soon as you pop it in (It does take a LONG time to load on my LG BD-390 which in normally fast),you will notice a HUGE difference from anything you've seen in the past.This Box Set is very nice. The kids got a kick out of The Hand Painted Music Box included.Everything else is great too ... Souvenir reprint, Snapshots (Postcards), Hardcover Book.Very nice presentation when you open it up, and it was shipped in it's own special boxto insure a safe delivery.One little gripe .. The CD that's included does not match the one being sold individually.The box says there are 16 tracks, but there's actually 17. The unlisted track is My Favorite Thingswhich I think is by Lea Michele. On the disc being sold individually there are 24 tracks.Some are reprise songs, so maybe that doesn't matter, but we are missing Laendler, Entr acte & Finale.Since this is the Super Box Set, I wish that they had included the full CD as well.	5.0	On Blu-ray at last!

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	ABX3704SXNU5F	"Toni ""the bookworm"""	"Just wonderful!!! Absolutely wonderful!!! For the timeframe of when I remember this enchanting musical, I cannot think of anything better to bring you back to when this movie was first released. How it went from a film that would be considered overbudget and a risk to one of the most beloved of all time!!Everyone pretty much knows the screen adaptation of the life of Maria Augusta Von Trapp, who went from a postulate with a true desire to give her life in service to God, to becoming the mother of 7 children plus 3 more of her own.But without taking away from any of the beauty and majesty of this film, there is a harshness in the reality of Maria's real life that is presented in the second disc of this 2-disc offering. That was the part that I became intensely interested in because what Hollywood tends to do is take ""creative"" license with any story and fit it into whatever fits the mold they want, regardless of the truth. The truth here was rather sobering, and even though I absolutely love this movie, I now know how far away the reality was taken, and how much Hollywood created.The packaging is of 2 DVD's with the first being the movie itself. Vivid, pure colors with incredible sound. The majesty of the Austrian mountains and villages as well as the story that pulls on the heartstrings and gives you moments to pause and admire. Disc one starts with a commercial about DVD piracy, then goes into a short commercial about purchasing other musical classics available. You are given a short introduction by the ever-elegant Ms. Andrews, who is as gracious and beautiful and charming as always, and then you are brought to the movie.But it is in the second DVD that we are given much more to enjoy and ponder in both how the movie was made and the realities of how real life was tranformed into reel life.It goes as such:1)  My favorite things: Julie Andrews remembers2)  Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer reminiscence3)  On location with The Sound of Music4)  From Liesl to Gretl: A 40th anniversary reunion5)  When you know the notes to sing: a sing-a-long phenomenon6)  A&E; Biography: The Von Trapp Family, Harmony and Discord7)  Restoration comparison8)  Mia Farrow screen test9)  Trailers and TV spots10) Still galleriesIt is in this second DVD that you you are treated to how this magnificent, family-friendly movie was made from start to finish. What a story you will be given! Just to mention one story without giving away much, I had always heard that Christopher Plummer had been difficult during the filming, and that he didn't really like working with kids, but because it was rumor, you couldn't pay it much mind. Well, in this documentary, he admits that he was ""a boor... difficult"" during the initial part of the filming, and that he agreed with W.C. Fields in that he also liked children....cooked. He also had initial disdain for the movie in that he called it ""The Sound of Mucas"". During this documentary, the fact that he didn't try to hide behind the truth was an interesting insight. Even in the interview that was done with the children, now as adults, they said they knew even back then, that Plummer didn't like them. But Plummer did save himself during the interview, in saying that he eventually came to appreciate the kids. How nice.For me, the most incredible part of the second disc was the A&E; Biography. The Maria in the movie was just a slight shadow of the personality of the real-life Maria Von Trapp, who seemed to be a tortured soul all her life. When Maria's mother died at the fragile age of three, and her father abandoned her, she was left with her guardian uncle, who was physically abusive. She became a precocious child who lived carefree, but one day, she decided to go into a church near her home, and wondering what people were doing who were going into the confessional, found her salvation after three hours of talking to the priest. Wanting to become a nun, and finally feel the life of being within a ""family"", she tried to live the life of a postulate, but the Reverand Mother realizing Maria's zeal for life, turned her instead to the role of governess for the Von Trapp family. Her love for the Captain, and his desire to support the family, were immensely distorted in the film. Also, Maria's issues with control, and the childrens issues with their subserviance to her, led to a great deal of sadness and despair, which makes for the sobering reality of the real life of Maria Von Trapp. It does not change the beauty of the movie, but you certainly realize how far removed the movie was from the truth. Suffice it to say that liberal license was taken with the story.This movie itself is pure joy and comfort, and it is just perfect. But it is the insight into how it was made, and the story of the real Maria, that makes for a more pensive thought."	5.0	The spectacular creation of The Sound of Music!!!	2006-02-23	9	9	0

They asked me to mail it back to England at my expense to ruminate on whether Zoverstock would consider a refund.  But then they already told me it was my fault for not discovering that it was region 2 and unplayable in America.  Amazon said that I might be an American soldier stationed in England who actually wanted a DVD that would play there, in spite of my California address.  Amazon also said that their policy was that the buyer , not them had to discover the true region of the DVD before the purchase, which is very difficult to do for a used DVD.  I got ripped off.  And since I replaced my VHS library with DVDs all at the same time, I got ripped off 2 more times buying region 2 DVDs whi8ch Amazon will not cover on their buyer satisfaction warranty.  So Amazon also has a buyer beware policy.  By the way, the Region listed above did not appear on the product description until after the transaction was completed.  They do not list regions prior to purchase.  So buying used DVDs is a game of &#34;Gothcha&#34; since they can say they told you after the fact when it is too late to get a refund or coverage under Amazon's warranty.

There are lots of bonus items: a musical box, postcards, a book about the history of the movie, etc... This is what I regret. I should have just bought the DVD without all the extras (if you are an uber-fan you might want all these items as part of your collection). However, I know I'll simply watch the movie and not touch the other items which makes it a waste of materials and money.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A25NR7I5IGT2KS	Tyler Durden	This movie is really borring.  Don't get me wrong I like Juile Andrews, but I find her more attractive now.  I could watch Princess Diaries over and over and never get bored with her.  But in this movie she looked more like Sandy Dunncen, the women from Hogen Family.  She was the woman that replaced Valerie Harper after there was a problem with production.  I did like Valerie better then Sandy, but I find Sandy more attactive then Valerie, but I like Julie Andrews more then both of them, but I especially like the modern Julie Andrews more now then in this movie.  The only person that did a good job was James Cann.  He was able to provide substance to an otherwise slow moving movie.  You might remember James Cann from Roolerball and the comedy Godfather.  He was good as the comic relief in that movie.

How wrong I was! You don't realize how much picture is lost with standard 480p releases until a monumental blu ray transfer like this comes along and provides a home viewing experience that literally feels like seeing the movie for the first time.As far as I'm concerned, this is the best blu ray I own - and not just because The Sound of Music is probably the greatest movie ever made, but because the picture quality is truly that beautiful. And that makes sense, considering the movie was filmed in 70mm and could contain so much more data than ordinary 35mm.  Also, from what I understand, the restoration process was taken extremely seriously and done with the highest technology possible. There's a reason why so many artists are pushing blu ray, and it's because for the first time people can experience their creativity and attention to detail, as it was meant to be seen.  There is SO much detail in this movie.  Seriously, if you loved this movie before you will have your mouth dropped open the entire time you sit through it in high definition.And the Audio quality! I didn't even know it was possible to make ancient audio files sound brand new, but it clearly is.  Every song sounds 1000000x better than my old CD soundtracks.  Add in surround sound... heavenly.OVERALL: I don't care how many VHS or DVD copies you have of this movie sitting around, you NEED this blu ray.  It's not just a restoration, it's a transformation.  You cannot have truly experienced The Sound of Music at home until seeing it in 1080p.  Not to mention it's cram packed with amazing extras that are actually watchable.  In case you can't tell, this BD just makes me so happy.  If you appreciate the movie (or bless you, never seen it before) you MUST experience it on BD!	5.0	Blu-Re-Mi!	2010-11-03	516	496	20

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3OCFSGD9JB6R5	Vera Hau	I have been so fond of this movie 'The Sound of music' since I first saw it ten years ago.  The breathtaking scenery, perfect voice of Maria by Julie Andrews, a remarkable handsome Captain by Christopher Plummer (who then became my favorite male star), the children's singings, the beautiful dance by Rolf and Liesl, the wonderful classical music,....every part of the movie made me can't forget it for the rest of my life.&quot;..my heart wants to sing every song it hears&quot;, this came into my heart so deeply and now it's what I would say.  I liked music when I was small, but after watching this movie, I became not only like music but couldn't stopping loving music. What a magic by 'The sound of music'! Now I still keep watching this film occasionally, and always listen to the soundtrack, it's so relaxing.Thanks Robert Wise, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, without your efforts, we couldn't have such a favorite movie.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AQ8XC8Z7WALHK	"Video guy ""Video guy"""	"I watched ""The Sound of Music"" numerous times in theatres when it was first out. Then eventually got a copy on VHS, then DVD when that came. It just wasn't the same though. Until now. This Blu-ray version is remastered from a restored copy of the film. And it looks splendid. Sharp images with clean colors. It looks great on my 52"" screen. There are only a couple places where a slight color shift is noticed within a scene. It was a pleasure to watch the film again. The package also contains the remastered film on DVD and a number of extras. The interactive BD extras are good, although after you make me click my way through several selections, I would like to be rewarded with more than 2 photos, as is the case in some places. I know there is no shortage of photos of the production. Likewise, having to click through a selection tree to watch a short clip is cumbersome. I would like to be able to see all those clips as one video (given that they appear to have been produced a long time ago, they were probably part of a longer video to start with. A Blu-ray disc has room to spare so why not give me both options?This is a must buy if you ever liked ""The Sound of Music"""	5.0	Sound of Music in full glory	2010-12-31	4	4	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AZOSR4BNXWR4R	Vincent Desjardins	I bought this one day when Amazon was featuring it as a Gold Box deal for $18.99. Since that was cheaper than the price of the stand-alone DVD version, I couldn't resist. It comes with a wonderful collection of goodies, including a music box. I haven't watched the entire movie yet, but the scenes I did watch looked beautiful on Blu-Ray. There are lots of extras on the second disc including the Carol Burnett, Julie Andrews 'Sound of Music' parody from their first Carnegie Hall concert (made before the film came out, while the play was still a Broadway hit). Another special feature allows you to explore the Austrian locations for the film. There is a miniature reproduction of the original program booklet along with another book on the making of the film. My one complaint, which has nothing to do with the movie, is that the music box that comes with this set is very difficult to wind and then it only plays for about 5 or 6 seconds. But since I didn't buy this set for the music box, it's no big deal. All in all, if you can ever get this at the special low price, it's definitely a bargain and a great buy.	5.0	Great collection of goodies	2013-01-25	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A1WXT5X8MSUU0T	Vodskar	Taken from review By Dennis A. Amith (kndy)VIDEO:&#34;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition&#34; is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 2:20:1), AVC@22 MBPS. This is where &#34;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition&#34; literally looks amazing. For those who have owned previous versions of the film on DVD, back in 2005, the film went through restoration using a backup negative of the original 70 mm print. At the time, the original 70mm 6-Track print was so damaged, there was no way to even use the original negative at that time and most of us who watched the 40th Anniversary Edition felt that the film looked absolutely beautiful compared to it's earlier 2000 DVD release.With that being said, technology has changed within the last five years since the release of the 40th Anniversary. The damaged original 70 mm print that couldn't be used in the restoration of the film in 2005 can now be used for the film with new hardware and software and is now receiving 8K digital scanning by 20th Century Fox for perfect restoration.No longer is the film hazy, no longer is the film more on the pinkish side. &#34;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition&#34; is vibrant. The grass...you can see the various grains of grass, the strands in green, yellow and detail of the mountains over looking Salzburg. I was amazed! Another example, Maria splashing the water before she heads to the von Trapps, you can see the water droplets flying in the air, another one is the von Trapp's uncle and his coat, you can see the wool in his jacket. There is so much detail in this latest version of &#34;The Sound of Music&#34;, it's incredible! I am literally speechless because I own previous versions of this film on video and never before have I seen this much clarity in the film ever!And I find it quite funny for each review I have done for the film, I mention of how the cinematography of William Reynolds was captured perfectly but watching it on Blu-ray, the cinematography... may it be the shots of Maria on the mountain, Maria with the kids on the mountain, the wedding ceremony, etc., I just feel that the cinematography as seen on the 45th Anniversary Edition via the new restoration really captures the beauty of &#34;The Sound of Music&#34; than ever before. Absolutely breathtaking!Once again, the crew who restored this film...I give your crew a standing ovation...what you were able to accomplish with this film on Blu-ray is absolutely fantastic!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:&#34;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition&#34; is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 4.0 Dolby Surround, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DTS. Because the film was shot with a 6-track and because they were provided with the audio without the dialogue, for this 2010 edition, they were able to remove all noise but also making sure to utilize a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and as mentioned, I've owned several versions of this film and I even own the soundtrack to this film.The way this music was handled through the surround channels was amazing. The music and the instruments playing on individual channels was well done. The first thing that came to my mind during sequences of the sisters singing &#34;Maria&#34; to the wedding sequence, the sounds that were utilized through those channels were amazing. Also, they were able to isolate the sound of Salzburg up the hills, the sound of wind, the birds... I was in awe with the lossless soundtrack.I absolutely love the soundtrack for this film and this is the best I have ever heard of it. If you have a 7.1 setup (center speaker, two fronts, two surrounds, two rear surrounds and your subwoofer), you will definitely be impressed with how alive the music comes as it really sounds beautiful via the soundscape in the home. Once again, I was in awe when I heard the music and I'm sure many people will be just as impressed by it.Similar to the video restoration, the audio restoration for this 45th anniversary is fantastic! And the crew responsible for the audio restoration for this release should be proud because they did an outstanding job!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES&#34;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition&#34; comes with the following special features from the 35th and 40th Anniversary DVD versions of the film but also newer special features that just literally packs this 45th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray release:DISC 1:* Your Favorite Things: An Interactive Celebration - A new way to watch &#34;The Sound of Music&#34;.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AUSFBVEVSUMBW	Wade H. Rice Jr.	"The Sound of Music (45th Anniversary Edition) (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)There's not much I can add to the positive comments previous reviewers have said of the Blu-ray edition of TSOM.  The only thing I can say is that the producers of this reissue left no stone unturned when it came to providing as much information and extras as possible about the film's background, production, and legacy.  If the producers found anything open to question, those issues were solved, and any issues about lack of quality were fully addressed.  Thankfully, whatever naysayers there are, nearly all their complaints were either due to lack of understanding about the equipment they have to view the movie on, or how to work the interactive programs contained on the first two disks.  And the reissue producers came up with the novel addition of a regular DVD edition to keep the kids entertained on a trip so that they won't have to continually ask Mom and Dad, ""Are we there yet?""This film will outlive all of us alive today, and continue its glorious story for generations to come."	5.0	Overall, a Great Job Done on the Restoration!	2010-11-29	1	1	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3F3GMRUZIBG1L	WALTER BRAZIL	"THE SOUND OF MUSIC tem sido o musical mais bonito que assisti dezenas de vezes em toda minha vida, seja pela estoria envolvente e light, pelo visual magnifico da Austria, pelas musicas inesqueciveis, pela presenca carismatica de Julie Andrews e dos filhos do Capitao Von Trapp ,enfim, por tudo, EXCETO pela qualidade 5 stars da imagem em Blu-ray, que apesar de very crisp, muito nitida em todos os aspectos, peca pelo excesso do desagradavel ruido de imagem (film grain in excess), que no mesmo DVD que acompanha o BD tal ocorrencia foi tremendamente reduzida, quase imperceptivel na maioria das cenas. Tambem o som DTS-HDMA 7.1 deixa muito a desejar em termos de sinal de audio, o que prejudica a sensacao de dinamica sonora. Podem verificar o que estou dizendo por simplesmente comparar o Blu-ray THE SOUND OF MUSIC com o magnifico  Blu-ray CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, cuja qualidade da imagem deste ultimo ultrapassa tudo o que tenho visto em termos de restauracao de filmes antigos (old picture restauration), totalmente film grain free - nenhum ruido na imagem para nos distrair da estoria do filme, que tambem recebeu um excelente som DTS-HDMA 7.1 (very good DTS-HDMA sound), servindo este filme CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG como referencia absoluta no quesito restauracao de bons filmes antigos. Mesmo assim eu recomendo a compra de A NOVICA REBELDE (THE SOUND OF MUSIC) por todos aqueles que sao fanaticos apaixonados por este lindo musical, porque o resultado final da imagem ainda supera a do ultimo DVD. Antes de encerrar, informo que estes dois musicais vendidos pela  amazon.com  vem com legendas e dublagens em portugues do Brasil. A minha nota para TSM foi de 4 estrelas (four stars) apenas pela boa qualidade da imagem, e 5 estrelas (five stars) seria pelo filme como um todo. My TV is a Panasonic Plasma 50"" FullHD, and my AV-Receiver is a TX-NR906 ONKYO conected to six Infinity Kappa speakers and Alfa Infinity subwoofer."	4.0	Wonderfull but not perfect	2010-12-18	8	0	8

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A238QWID7YUWU3	wearethefuture	I gave my VHS and dvd versions away and bought the electonic one to watch as it is one of my up movies still.  Even though I heard from friends who went on the tour in Salzburg they left by train, and Maria Von Trapp's books say so as well, the movie adaptation at the beginning is what I remember from Austrian Alps and is still breathtaking to watch and listen to.  That is my favorite part.  I recently saw the 1956 movie Die Familie Trapp, which was the German original movie, who bought the movie rights from Maria Von Trapp.  I found a lot of the beginning scenery of the Alps were also in the 1956 version, so this 1963 version, as well done and beautiful as it is, already had a foundation in the 1956 movie.  So worth watching both to compare.  Both versions are very good with all the actors.  It is also worth comparing with Maria Von Trapp's autobiographies.	4.0	I gave my copies away and bought this	2014-04-30	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A14K9FIM4DULM1	Wendy Sparkes	Whether young or old, it's a film that captures you right from the very beginning. The songs are sung and performed well, woven into the story almost effortlessly it seems. You'll want to sing and watch it over & over again.Maria (wonderfully played by Julie Andrews) arrives at the Von Trapp family mansion to be governess to Captain Von Trapp's 7 children. However, what the children want is their father's love & attention, & the only way to get his attention is by playing tricks on the governesses, which has caused them to leave. Not so Maria. She weathers the tricks & reaches out to them with love & teaches them to sing.Since the death of his wife Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) has grieved deeply, & won't allow the house with singing & laughter - anything that reminds him of her, & he runs his house like he would a ship, certain whistles mean certain things. However, during one of his frequent long absences, Maria has won over the children & brought singing back into his house. Gradually his heart is softened as Maria encourages him to get to know his children, & as music & laughter & love re-enter his life, something else he thought was long dead has come to life...loving another woman.A great film filled with the sound of children...the sound of laughter...the sound of romance...& the sound of music!	5.0	A great film for all.	2008-05-29	0	0	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AY6D3WIKQHCHJ	Wilfredo C. Derequito	From the opening scene of Maria prancing among the hills and along a stream to the closing scene of the Von Trapps climbing a high mountain on their way to freedom, there is not a single dull moment in this story.Set against the backdrops of the breathtaking and panoramic hills and mountains of beautiful Austria, The Sound of Music tells the story of Frau Maria (Julie Andrews), a spirited young novice who finds herself constricted by the rigid discipline of the convent. Her kindly mother superior, sensing Maria's life at the crossroad, then tasks her to find her real self in the outside world by assigning her to work as governess to the seven motherless children of a retired sea captain, the stern Baron Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer).Before long the drab household is filled with laughter and music, and Maria and Von Trapp find themselves in love. Frau Maria and Baron Von Trapp eventually marry to form one complete happy family. But there's a hitch! The Nazis have taken over power in Austria and are now calling on the former sea captain to active service. There begins the Von Trapp family's suspenseful episode as they attempt to escape the clutches of the Nazis.The plot and the majestic sceneries are more than enough to keep the viewer entertained, touched and occupied. Add in the brilliance of the Richard Rodgers &amp; Oscar Hammerstein III songwriting team and you have an unforgettable cinematic masterpiece.Who can resist Maria as she runs among the hills singing 'The Sound of Music' at the top of her voice? Who won't be moved listening to the pious albeit naughty nuns as they try to solve the puzzle that is 'Maria'? Who can't feel the inspirational push of the mother superior as she sings 'Climb Every Mountain'? How about the sentimental and nationalistic undertone of 'Edelweiss'? The childlike innocence of 'My Favorite Things'? And yes! the playfulness of 'Do-Re-Mi'?I have been greatly privileged to watch this movie for countless times in my lifetime, both as a boy and as an adult. I look forward to watching it many more times in the future, hopefully with a bouncing grandchild perched on my lap!I just love this movie.

The Blu-Ray edition brings back the original sound and video with a vengeance.  It is beyond belief what the techies did to this musical.  If you have a Blu-Ray DVD Player, buy this version.  You will not regret it.  Teamed with HDTV it is sumptuous.  To answer one reviewers complaint, no you cannot play Blu-Ray on a conventional DVD player.  You are missing out.  Sorry.

The story of the challenges of a young girl left alone in the world before the war was an eye-opener before our 6th grader read Ann Frank. The events depicted in the movie brought the news of the Ukraine and Crimea in a way kids could understand.But the music and the romance keeps these codgers happy. I recall watching this at the old Carolina Cinema on the HUGE screen in Charlotte with family and friends.

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A2ASIT0JYIGHTA	William	Who could argue that SOM is the most enjoyed film of all time by so many people?  It has everything: charm, music and an engaging storyline. SOM has received so many re-runs in cinemas and it's understandable.  Generation after generation can relate to it, and the soundtrack is so special that you will be singing along in no time.  Overall, a must see for anyone who hasn't seen it.DVD SUMMARY:  While it is wonderful to have this film in all its widescreen glory on DVD, the transfer is not fantastic.  It is still better than having it on video, but the restoration work is somewhat disappointing.  A film of this age is bound to be a problem when restoring, but the work they've done is quite noticeable in scenes.  For example, considerable colourisation has been done to a number of scenes because the film has faded over the years.  This colourisation seems to be really bright one minute, then dull the next.  It therefores adds an unnatural aspect to it all.  Despite these issues, the DVD is still a must-purchase just to have the film in all its widescreen glory - afterall, who wants to see the pan and scan cropped video version now?  The special features on the DVD also make it a must own.  The DVD will eventually be remastered again, if anything to redo the 4.1 surrounded mix which currently does not  take full advantage of the original 6 channel mix.  Until then, the current DVD which is still worthy of a place in your collection (throw out that awful video copy).	4.0	Great film, average DVD transfer	2004-01-26	2	2	0

To see and hear the original cast members chat about their experiences and memories during the filming of the original movie is fantastic. You get to see the real Maria on whose life the story was based, and discover that she had a small appearance in the actual movie. There is so much to learn regarding the background of this movie.

To my suprise, I loved it. It's not a corny musical but a musical with romance, humor &amp; suspence. What more can you ask for? I loved it so much I bought it on DVD for superior sound and picture quality, which I got with this DVD.I have to thank the &quot;Sound of Music.&quot; I have become more open to many other older movies.The acting is superb by the main characters. The children's acting is off at times, but I don't exprect much from kids from that era. No big deal.

I really love the movie as it was premiered on February 7, 1965, the day when I was born and I just admire the movie by its musical score and the fabulous cast. I believe this movie will never be forgotten and if I were a billionairre, I would buy thousand titles so that every country, state and family should own it.In my own country, this movie is really admired and shown very often.	5.0	Unsurpassed!

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	AGOH8N902URMW	"Zeb ""zebra01"""	When I was about 19 I saw SOM in a real movie theater palace - one where you has reserved ticket seats. These theaters had upgraded their sound to handle the 6 track audio and expensive Todd-Ao projectors, screens and lenses. There were also beautiful and expensive programs booklets available in these palaces. The opening scene was breathtaking! When I watched the Blu-ray - it was like being there all over again. Your neighborhood theaters were showing it on a regular screen with mono and sometimes stereo sound. A few years ago I saw it at the American Film Institute - it was a terrible print - it was a painful viewing - I did notice that the younger generation was having a great time - and just loving every moment of the film. A young father and I began talking - I shared with him my experience - he was very interested in just how these masterpieces were shown in their prime. I still loved the AFI presentation in spite of its flaws which conflicted with my experience of 45 years ago!This restoration is a real treat - it brings beautiful and rapturous memories!	5.0	I am almost 65 and saw SOM in a theater palace	2010-11-08	6	6	0

6304117752	The Sound of Music [VHS]	A3ENFLFSDJXRWG	znayesh	My love for The Sound of Music began as a little girl, singing the songs at the top of my lungs.  It has always been my favorite movie.  I stopped in to Amazon today to see if it was available yet on DVD.  I'm actually  encouraged by the fact that it is currently unavailable.  Perhaps, as  another review mentioned, they're waiting for the 35th anniversary and will  re-release in new packaging and DVD too!  (hope hope hope)	5.0	I'm waiting for it to come out in DVD	1999-12-12	7	5	2
